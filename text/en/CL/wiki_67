<text>Port Dover is an unincorporated community and former town located in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada, on the north shore of Lake Erie. It is the site of the recurring Friday the 13th motorcycle rally. Prior to the War of 1812, this community was known as Dover Mills.

==Summary==
The Mayor of Norfolk County is Port Dover resident Amy Martin.

This community is the southern terminus for Ontario Highway 6; located to the south of the Northern Ontario community of McKerrow. This highway stretches northward as a two-lane, undivided highway until the traffic flow increases to four lanes shortly after it departs from Caledonia. In addition to allowing Port Dover residents direct access to the city of Hamilton, it also briefly merges with Highway 403 to allow for access to the Royal Botanical Gardens and locations on to Toronto.

The postal forward sortation area is &quot;N0A&quot;; sharing its Canada Post service with the western portion of Haldimand County. All residences and businesses within the Port Dover area have a &quot;583&quot; in their phone number.

Sightings of at least 128 bird species have been verified in Port Dover from 1956 to 2019; including the Indigo bunting, the Rose-breasted grosbeak, and the Scarlet tanager.

Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell Satellite TV or over-the-air. There is only one channel can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional five channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are twelve channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.

Ride Norfolk offers transportation between Port Dover and Simcoe on Thursdays and Fridays. This service is used for people in Simcoe to access the tourist attractions of Port Dover mainly during the summer months. It can also be used for Port Dover residents to access doctors, medical services, and dental services in Simcoe that would usually require an automobile.

== Demographics ==
The second largest of the Communities in Norfolk County, Ontario, Port Dover had a population of 7,871 at the time of the 2021 Census. This is an increase of 12.7% over the population of 6,984 in 2016. English is spoken by the majority of the residents, with 285 people speaking languages other than English or French. The majority of Port Dover residents were born in Canada, with 515 residents being born in Europe in addition to 10 African-born residents, 70 US-born residents and 70 residents who were born in Asia.

==Etymology==
Port Dover is named for Dover, England.

==Climate==
Port Dover traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming.

The warmest summers that Port Dover has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

==History==
Port Dover&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.

In 1670, French missionaries François Dollier de Casson and René Bréhant de Galinée became the first Europeans to winter at what is now Port Dover. Earthen remains and a plaque mark the spot near the fork of the Lynn River (Patterson&#x27;s Creek to many older Port Doverites) and Black Creek where they and seven Frenchmen (the first Europeans known to have ascended the Great Lakes to Sault Ste. Marie) built a hut and chapel. Just outside the community, a cross with the arms of France had been erected on 23 March 1670, claiming the area for King Louis XIV over the Lake Erie region.

By 1794 the first settlers, a group of United Empire Loyalists, had established a hamlet known as Dover Mills (named for the English port of Dover). Peter Walker was the first settler of this community, becoming its unofficial founder.

This community was the subject of an American raid during the War of 1812, on May 14–15, 1814. Much of it was destroyed but was later rebuilt.
After making their landing on the shore, 750 American soldiers launched a surprise attack on the village&#x27;s civilians. Scattered elements of nearby militia and regular units tried to defend the village without any success. Re-enactments carried out by local volunteer groups have allowed the British-Canadian forces to soundly defeat the American troops in battle. The survivors of the war rebuilt the town of Port Dover further downstream on Patterson&#x27;s Creek. The raid was part of America&#x27;s Niagara campaigns toward the end of the War of 1812.

During the war, in August 1812, Major General Isaac Brock gathered a force of regulars and militia here. Crossing the lake by boat, they reached Amherstburg (then also in Upper Canada) and attacked and captured the American Hull&#x27;s Army at Detroit.

In 1835, Port Dover was incorporated as a village and later as a town.

By 1842, the village was growing and had a population of almost 400. The harbour, lighthouse and bridge across the river had been completed as had the road to Hamilton; there was a grammar school, a grist mill, a saw mill and a Presbyterian church in the course of construction. By 1896 the population was 1,000.

In 1877, Port Dover was a large village with 1,100 residents, most living on the west bank of the River Lynn. The South Norfolk Railway was started in the county and began operating in 1889. Even earlier, the Hamilton &amp; Lake Erie Railway (H&amp;LER) began operating in 1873 but was merged with the Hamilton &amp;
Northwestern Railway which completed the final section to Port Dover and to Jarvis in the mid 1870s. A report from 1924 also discusses an electric railway that had been introduced &quot;in recent years&quot;. This was the Grand River Railway that connected Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo with connection to Brantford and Port Dover.

By the 1920s tourism was an important contributor to the economy, with many summer visitors attracted by the beach. There was some light industry in the town but Port Dover was best known as a major fishing centre, with fish shipped by rail and by ship not only within Canada but also to the U.S. Notable amenities like Ivey&#x27;s Greenhouses and the incredible Port Dover beaches caused most of the passenger train traffic to occur during the summer months. Rail service was also offered on the Port Dover &amp; Lake Huron Railway (later purchased by Canadian National) line from the Caledonia Train Station to Port Dover until these services were cancelled after October 26, 1957.

A popular amusement arcade was in operation in Port Dover from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s. Originally consisting of pinball games, it would expand to include video arcade games. During the late-1960s and early-1970s, local teenagers would frequently hang out at places like the Blue Pickerel, the ferris wheel, and the Summer Garden where musical acts like Guy Lombardo would make frequent appearances.

Businesses would often close one hour earlier on Wednesday as a measure to ensure that breadwinners, homemakers and their children would spend more time together until the 1970s. This occurred regardless of negative economic effects and would apply to most non-essential services.

In 1974, the town was amalgamated into the new city of Nanticoke within the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk.

The Paris Port Dover Pipe Band was established on February 18, 2000 by Pipe Major Gordon Black as a competitive and as a community pipe band. They act as ambassadors on the global level as well as on a local level. The band was formally established when a constitution and small band were formed out of ten pipers, one bass, and one snare. In 2001, Nanticoke and all other municipalities within the region were dissolved and the region was divided into two single tier municipalities. Port Dover is now an unincorporated community in Ward 6 of Norfolk County. The Stanley Cup came to Port Dover in 2004 (with Jassen Cullimore) when the 2003–04 Tampa Bay Lightning won the Cup. He was the fourth NHL player to present the Stanley Cup to this small hockey town on the shore of Lake Erie. The Canadian Coast Guard stationed the Cape-class motor lifeboat CCGS &quot;Cape Lambton&quot; in the community in 2005.

Certain segments of the 2009 American horror film &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot; were filmed in Port Dover. The film was directed by George A. Romero and starred Alan van Sprang, Kenneth Welsh, and Kathleen Munroe. 40 wind turbines were supposed to be built in the area starting in 2013. However, Norfolk County council has effectively banned the placement of new wind turbines due to concerns about rural spaces being completely &quot;industrialized&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot;.

Until 2013, Port Dover had a high school which served students aged 14 through 21 in the immediate area. Approximately 1800 young people had fled the Port Dover Area between 2001 and 2011. Academic programs in Valley Heights Secondary School and Delhi District Secondary School were beefed up and prepared to accept former PDCS students after the closure date. An elementary school called Lakewood Public School opened in the old PDCS building in 2013.

== Motorcycle rally ==
Port Dover hosts tens of thousands of people every Friday the 13th for the Friday the 13th motorcycle rally, which was started on 13 November 1981 by a local bike shop owner named Chris Simons at what was then the Commercial Hotel on Main Street.

==Locations==
Port Dover contains the &quot;Arbor&quot; hot dog restaurant and the &quot;Knechtel&quot;s neighborhood market and fish restaurant.

The Erie Beach Hotel with its Cove Room and The Beach House are also popular dining attractions.

The &quot;Cliff Site&quot; was the first place designated by the federal Minister of the Environment as a National Historic Site of Canada (), as being of national historic significance. There two priests claimed sovereignty over the Lake Erie region for Louis XIV of France in 1670.

Located just a short driving distance away from the Stelco Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Port Dover is the site of romantic sunsets along its surrounding countryside. Port Dover can be used as an easy urban walking trail year round. Recommended activities are cycling, running, hiking, and walking. There are hills on Silver Lake Drive, Prospect Street, Bridge Street, and St. George Street. Most of the streets have sidewalks; but care should be taken around traffic especially during summer weekends. Walking on Park Street or Market Street takes the participant to Powell Park, which is the social epicenter of Port Dover. Depending on the participants&#x27; activity level, the town can be walked through in either 3 kilometres or 5 kilometres.

There are scenic waterfalls nearby and tourists generally go to nearby Port Ryerse as a side trip. Local roads that originate from here often lead to the hamlets of Fishers Glen, Normandale and Turkey Point (which is another seasonal beach destination). Even the farmers here generally enjoy the sunsets on their property. Apple wine, produced by the local farmers themselves, can be purchased by anyone due to their lack of alcohol content. This product is available in the Port Dover area. On clear summer nights, the Port Dover lighthouse can be seen glimmering brightly with the moon. The beaches in Port Dover have a tendency to emulate those that are beside the Mediterranean Sea.

=== Cemetery ===
At least 5,200 individuals, or families, have their remains interred at Port Dover Cemetery on the Blue Line Road, including famous poet, novelist, short-story writer, critic and editor Raymond Knister. The cemetery is a United Empire Loyalist cemetery that includes veterans from the War of 1812 along with other wars and conflicts that Canada was involved in. Due to the changing Canadian economic climate, a storage place for cremated remains was installed on the premises in 2011.

The Port Dover Cemetery is still functioning as of 2020 and people were buried here as far back as the early 19th-century.

<text>Paul Jones Fannin (January 29, 1907January 13, 2002) was an American businessman and politician. A Republican, he served as a U.S. Senator from Arizona from 1965 to 1977. He previously served as the 11th governor of Arizona from 1959 to 1965.

==Early life and career==
Paul Fannin was born in Ashland, Kentucky, to Thomas Newton and Rhoda Catherine (née Davis) Fannin. His father worked as a dairy farmer and also owned a harness shop. Fannin and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, when he was eight months old due to his father&#x27;s health. He received his early education at Kenilworth Elementary School, and graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1925.

Fannin attended the University of Arizona for two years before transferring to Stanford University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration in 1930. He then returned to Phoenix, where he joined his family&#x27;s hardware business. He and his brother Ernest later established the Fannin Gas and Supply Company, a gas and petroleum equipment company. He served as president of the company from 1945 until 1956, when he and his brother sold the company.

In 1934, Fannin married Elma Addington, to whom he remained married until her death in 2001. The couple had one daughter and three sons, including Bob Fannin.

==Governor of Arizona==
A conservative Republican, Fannin was elected Governor of Arizona in 1958, defeating Attorney General Robert Morrison by nearly 30,000 votes. He was sworn into office on January 5, 1959. He was re-elected in 1960 and again in 1962.

During his tenure, Fannin increased funding for the public school system by raising sales taxes, equalized property taxes, established the first medical school in the state, and created the Arizona-Mexico Commission to promote tourism and trade across the border. He also served as chairman of the Western Governors Association, as well as a member of the Executive Committee of Council of State Governors and of the National Civil Defense Advisory Council.

==U.S. Senator==

In 1964, when Senator Barry Goldwater declined to seek re-election in order to run for President of the United States, Fannin was elected to succeed him in the U.S. Senate. He defeated Democrat Roy Elson, an aide to Senator Carl Hayden, by a 51–49% margin. He was re-elected to a second term in 1970, receiving 56% of the vote. He did not seek re-election to a third term in 1976.

During his Senate career, Fannin was a hard-line conservative, often voting with Senator Goldwater on the issues, including his vote against the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972. As the ranking Republican on the Senate Interior Committee, he was a spokesman for Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford on energy policy; he opposed new limits on strip mining and tighter reins on federal lands. He also joined conservative Democratic Senators to preserve the clause of the Taft–Hartley Act that let the states decide whether to prohibit mandatory membership for workers in unionized shops. In 1968, he became the principal sponsor behind the Central Arizona Project, which diverted water of the Colorado River to central and southern Arizona.

Fannin voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but did not vote on the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court and voted against Civil Rights Act of 1968.

During part of his tenure in the Senate, Fannin sat at the candy desk. He continued to live in Phoenix, Arizona, until he died of a stroke on January 13, 2002. He is buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix.

<text>Men of Valor is a first-person shooter video game developed by 2015, Inc. and published by Vivendi Universal Games for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox platforms. &quot;Men of Valor&quot; is based on the Unreal Engine 2 and simulates infantry combat during the Vietnam War, more specifically, the Tet Offensive in 1968. The game was released in 2004 to mostly positive reviews.

== Plot ==
The story of &quot;Men of Valor&quot; follows Dean Shepard and his squad of Marines from the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Division in 1968, through sixteen missions during the Vietnam War including missions at the height of the Tet Offensive. In historically-based scenarios, the player assumes a variety of roles in which they man the door gun on a Huey helicopter, steer a riverboat along enemy-infested shores, battle their way through enemy tunnel complexes, and call down fire as a forward observer. Mission types include pilot rescues, recon patrols, POW rescue, and search-and-destroy ops, all typical objectives throughout the offensive. Between missions are film clips in both Black and White and Colour showcasing the real war, a similar approach to most WWII games at the time.

== Development ==
&quot;Men of Valor&quot; was developed by 2015, Inc. shortly after work finished on &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, with 73/100 for Xbox and 71/100 for Microsoft Windows. The game was praised for its story, character development, setting, gameplay, and atmosphere, but was also criticized for its voice acting, unreliable checkpoint system, and frequent difficulty spikes. 

Eurogamer gave the title 6/10, stating: &quot;The net result for the makers of &quot;Medal Of Honor&quot; is a game that&#x27;s a pleasantly unpleasant diversion from old WW2 glories, yet evidently not the triple A game Vivendi Universal would have been hoping for. Still, &quot;Men Of Valor&quot; is a solid, enjoyable and challenging Vietnam take on the sort of scripted cinematic shooters that the public evidently love to death.&quot; 

IGN gave the PC version 6.8/10 and the Xbox version 7.8/10.

<text>The 1978 Tabas earthquake (Persian: زمین‌لرزه ۱۳۵۷ طبس) occurred on September 16 at 19:05:55 local time in central Iran. The shock measured 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX+ (&quot;Violent&quot;). The death toll was in the range of 15,000–25,000, with severe damage occurring in the town of Tabas. The day before, a 5.5 magnitude quake had struck southwestern Iran in the morning and killed at least 42 people in and around the towns of Masjid-e Solaiman and Izeh.

Eighty percent of the human deaths occurred in Tabas, but a total of 85 villages were also affected. This seismic force was felt in Tehran, about away. About of ground deformation was observed, with about of maximum slip. Only one significant M5 aftershock occurred.

==Damage==
The earthquake destroyed or severely damaged around 90 villages. The town of Tabas was completely destroyed. Nearly 85% of the population was killed. 

Sixty villages were badly damaged, including Ferdows, where 80 percent of the city was destroyed. Reportedly, two-thirds of Iran, including the capital city of Tehran, felt the earthquake.

Manuel Berberian reported over 20,000 people were killed and 15,000 housing units destroyed.

<doc id="1178241" wikidata="Q1306351" url="?curid=1178241" title="Silenes">
<text>In inorganic chemistry, silenes, or disilalkenes, are silicon compounds that contain double bonds, where the oxidation state of Si is +2. The parent molecule is disilene, Si2H4.

== Structure ==
The first transient disilene was reported in 1972 by D. N. Roark and Garry J. D. Peddle. Simple disilenes easily polymerize. To suppress this tendency, bulky substituents are used. Indeed the first isolable disilene, tetramesityldisilene, was described in 1981 by West, Fink, and Michl. It was prepared by UV-photolysis of the related cyclic trisilane:
: 2 [Si(mesityl)2]3 → 3 (mesityl)2Si=Si(mesityl)2

==Structure of tetramesityldisilene ==
Tetramesityldisilene is a yellow-orange solid. The Si=Si double bond lengths of disilenes vary between 2.14 and 2.29 Å and are nearly 5 to 10% shorter than the Si-Si single bond lengths of corresponding disilanes. A peculiarity of disilenes is the &quot;trans&quot;-bending of the substituents, which is never observed in alkenes. The &quot;trans&quot;-bent angles of disilenes between the R2Si planes and the Si=Si vector range from 0 to 33.8 °. This distortion is rationalized by the stability of the corresponding silylene fragments, although disilenes do not typically dissociate.

The distorted geometry of disilenes can be rationalized by considering the valence orbitals of silicon, which are 3s and 3p, whereas those of carbon are 2s and 2p. Thus, the energy gap between the &quot;n&quot;s and &quot;n&quot;p orbitals of a silicon atom is larger than that of a carbon atom.
Therefore, silylene fragments are in a singlet state, while carbene fragments are in a triplet state. So, when double bonds are formed by the interaction of these two fragments, disilenes which consist of two silylene units are &quot;trans&quot;-bending and alkenes which consist of two carbene units are planar. The bending is even more extreme for the tin analogues of disilenes.

==Synthesis==
Disilenes are generally synthesized by reduction of 1,2-dihalodisilane, by retro-Diels–Alder fragmentation, by dimerization of silylenes, by photofragmentation of cyclopolysilanes, or by rearrangement of silylsilylenes.

A series of 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexaalkyl-2,3-bis(trialkylsilyl)tetrasil-2-enes structural analogues are typically synthesised using reductive coupling of the corresponding 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaalkyl-2,3-tribromotrisilanes.

== IUPAC names ==
To form the root of the IUPAC names for silenes, simply change the -an- infix of the parent to -en-. For example, - is the silane &quot;disilANe&quot;. The name of = is therefore &quot;disilENe&quot;.

In higher silenes, where isomers exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:
#Number the longest silicon chain that contains the double bond in the direction that gives the silicon atoms of the double bond the lowest possible numbers.
#Indicate the location of the double bond by the location of its first silicon.
#Name branched or substituted silenes in a manner similar to silanes.
#Number the silicon atoms, locate and name substituent groups, locate the double bond, and name the main chain.

<text>Chang Cheh (; 10 February 1923 – 22 June 2002) was a Chinese filmmaker, screenwriter, lyricist and producer active in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Chang Cheh directed more than 90 films in Greater China, the majority of them with the Shaw Brothers Studio in Hong Kong. Most of his films are action films, especially &quot;wuxia&quot; and &quot;kung fu&quot; films filled with violence.

In the early 1970s he frequently cast actors David Chiang and Ti Lung in his films. In the late 1970s he mainly worked with a group of actors known as the Venom Mob. Chang Cheh is also known for his long-time collaboration with writer Ni Kuang.

==Career==
Referred to as &quot;The Godfather of Hong Kong cinema&quot;, Chang directed nearly 100 films in his illustrious career at Shaw Brothers, which ran the gamut from swordplay films (&quot;One-Armed Swordsman&quot;, &quot;The Assassin&quot;, &quot;Golden Swallow&quot;) to kung fu films (&quot;Five Shaolin Masters&quot;, &quot;Five Venoms&quot;, &quot;Kid with the Golden Arm&quot;) to more modern period dramas (&quot;Chinatown Kid&quot;, &quot;Boxer From Shantung&quot;, &quot;The Generation Gap&quot;) to lavish costume epics (&quot;The Water Margin&quot;, &quot;The Heroic Ones&quot;, &quot;Boxer Rebellion&quot;).

After graduating from National Central University (Nanjing University) in Chongqing, where he studied politics, Chang moved to Hong Kong, where he became a film critic. Chang got his start in the film industry as a screenwriter; his first script was &quot;Girl&#x27;s Mask&quot;, a movie from Shanghai which was released in 1947. He wrote several more scripts before making his directorial debut in 1949 with &quot;Happenings in Ali Shan&quot;. His first big hit came with 1967&#x27;s &quot;One-Armed Swordsman&quot;, the first film in Hong Kong history to gross HK$1 million. The film catapulted actor Jimmy Wang Yu to stardom and cemented Chang&#x27;s status as one of Hong Kong&#x27;s top directors. In the same year, he released &quot;The Assassin&quot;, another early Chang classic, and in 1968 he followed up with &quot;Golden Swallow&quot;, a sequel to King Hu&#x27;s classic wuxia picture &quot;Come Drink With Me&quot;.

Chang often co-wrote scripts with fellow screenwriter Ni Kuang, and occasionally co-directed films with directors such as Baau Hok-li, Wu Ma and Gwai Chi-hung. He even occasionally wrote and co-wrote music for his films. In addition to his film related work, he also wrote novels, poetry and non-film related articles under numerous pseudonyms.

Chang was heavily influenced by directors Akira Kurosawa, Hideo Gosha, Sergio Leone, and Sam Peckinpah, Cheh brought elements from these movies into his own work, revolutionizing Hong Kong filmmaking. His swordplay films of the 1960s (including &quot;One Armed Swordsman&quot;), filled with bloody scenes of the hero cutting his way through a roomful of opponents, were considered at the time by Westerners to be violent trash but are now looked back on as masterpieces of the genre.

In the early 1970s Chang began making kung fu films (including Five Shaolin Masters and Five Venoms) sometimes filming four or five movies in a single year. His earlier kung fu movies were often done in collaboration with choreographer (and future director) Lau Kar Leung, who Chang had worked with, along with choreographer Tong Gaai, on earlier films. After falling out with Lau on the set of &quot;Disciples of Shaolin&quot;, Chang started featuring a troupe of actors made up of Sun Chien, Chiang Sheng, Philip Kwok, Lo Meng, Lu Feng, Wei Pai (and Yu Tai Ping), who would come to be known as &quot;The Venoms&quot;, as actors and choreographers in his films. His films from this period, including &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;, &quot;Kid with the Golden Arm&quot;, and &quot;Crippled Avengers&quot;, feature a heavy influence from the wuxia movie genre, and are considered his most popular films in the west – not counting 1982&#x27;s &quot;Five Element Ninjas&quot;, aka &quot;Chinese Superninjas&quot;.

Chang was a pioneer of what is known by some as &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot;; films that emphasize brotherhood, loyalty and honor, and several of his films, including &quot;Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Boxer From Shantung&quot; and &quot;Chinatown Kid&quot;, can be seen as clear influences on the later work of directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam. His influence on future filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino (who listed Chang as a dedicatee in the end credits of Kill Bill: Volume 2), Robert Rodriguez and Zhang Yimou is unquestionable. John Woo, who lists Cheh as his chief filmmaking inspiration, worked as assistant director on many of the master&#x27;s films, including &quot;Boxer From Shantung&quot;, &quot;The Water Margin&quot; and &quot;The Blood Brothers&quot;.

==Filmography==

===TV series===
In 1992, Chang produced Taiwan Television&#x27;s &quot;Ma&#x27;s Assassination&quot; (刺馬), which tells the same story as his 1973 film &quot;The Blood Brothers&quot;. The series is directed by Lu Feng and stars, among other actors, David Chiang.

==As lyricist==
Chang Cheh wrote the lyrics of more than 70 Chinese songs that have appeared in his films. The theme song of his directorial debut &quot;Happenings in Ali Shan&quot; (), also known as &quot;Gao Shan Qing&quot; (高山青; &quot;The High Green Mountain&quot;), is a particularly famous song in the Sinophone world.

<text>Clear title is the phrase used to state that the owner of real property owns it free and clear of encumbrances. In a more limited sense, it is used to state that, although the owner does not own clear title, it is nevertheless within the power of the owner to convey clear title. For example, a property may be encumbered by a mortgage. This encumbrance means that no one has clear title to the property. However, standard terms in a mortgage require the mortgage holder to release the mortgage if a certain amount of money is paid. Therefore, a buyer with enough money to satisfy both the mortgage and the current owner can get clear title.

According to Investopedia: &quot;A clear title is a title without any kind of lien or levy from creditors or other parties and poses no question as to legal ownership. For example, an owner of a car with a clear title is the sole undisputed owner, and no other party can make any kind of legal claim to its ownership.&quot;

<doc id="1178251" wikidata="Q7888290" url="?curid=1178251" title="United Nation of Islam">
<text>The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a black American new religious movement based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 as an offshoot of the Nation of Islam by Royall Jenkins, who continued to be the group&#x27;s leader until he died in September 2021 of complications resulting from COVID-19. He styled himself &quot;Royall, Allah in Person&quot;. Since its founding, the group has undergone numerous name changes and is currently known as the Value Creators.
==History==
Royall Jenkins was born in 1942 in South Carolina and grew up in eastern Maryland, later moving to New York and then Chicago, while working as a long-distance truck driver delivering publications of the Nation of Islam (NOI). He remained a member until after the death of Elijah Muhammad but split from the organization in 1978. According to Jenkins, he spent time on a spaceship with angels, where he learned that he was the Supreme Being and how to govern the world.

Public records show Jenkins working as a truck driver and living mostly with friends as he tried to recruit followers, including his daughter Maureen, who joined him in 1985 in a house in Waldorf, Maryland. The house was rented for them by Joseph Kelly, one of Jenkins&#x27; first converts. The UNOI eventually grew, and was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in New Jersey in 1993.

Between 1996 and 2002, the group relocated to its current Kansas City location. The UNOI is very controversial and currently has a membership of a few hundred people.

==Beliefs==
The beliefs of the UNOI are based on the beliefs of the NOI with considerable modifications by Jenkins. While believing that Allah came in the person of Wallace Fard Muhammad, founder of the NOI, Jenkins claims that he himself is Allah in his own person who is more powerful and who is given the task of coercing the submission of all things and perfecting everything used to magnify Him, after which &quot;men&quot; [specifically males] will all be God, or gods.

Jenkins stresses the relations between different races and sexes, referring extensively to black man, black woman, and white man. Black men are said to be the real and original men, whereas white people are claimed to have been created by a scientist named Yakub 6,000 years ago, the same belief held, at least in a metaphorical sense, by followers of the NOI prior to the death of Elijah Muhammad. Jenkins also claims that black men created black women as a natural pleasure, that women are inferior, and that following female guidance leads to Hell. He believes that black women are in league with white men, whom he considers enemies, and condemns women seeking child support, custody, and alimony through courts.

Jenkins also claims that the current NOI has been led astray by its leader Louis Farrakhan, whom he asserts is the most &quot;formidable enemy to Allah,&quot; and that Farrakhan uses tricks and deceptive tactics to &quot;silence anyone else&#x27;s voice&quot; and &quot;prepare the masses to fight for him,&quot; through appearing &quot;to be against the Whiteman and his government.&quot;

==Operations==
Members of the UNOI work as unpaid labor in various businesses owned by the organization. UNOI-owned businesses include a full-service gas station (Your Gas Station), several restaurants and bakeries, a sewing factory, an urgent-care medical facility (Your Colonic Center) and a construction company, among others. UNOI claims that it provides for all the needs of all full-time volunteers. The group has roughly 200 full-time members in Kansas City, with perhaps 300 spread across several other cities. Most of the latter are part-time.

UNOI hosts several call-in TV and radio programs across the United States. Jenkins appears regularly on these programs, as well as touring various US cities. The UNOI also offers classes and has a Web site that provides extensive writings by Jenkins and recordings of his TV appearances.

After moving to Kansas City in 1996 (although its headquarters was not moved there until 2001), the UNOI received commendations for apparently aiding in the renewal of an area along Quindaro Boulevard that had a reputation for high crime rates and as a slum. The group purchased several properties in the area at minimal prices and used them to house its various businesses. Commendations extended to the Wyandotte County government donating several additional (vacant) buildings to UNOI.

==Controversies==
===UNOI statements===
Critics of the UNOI note that members work for Jenkins&#x27; benefit in UNOI businesses and receive no income, apply for and receive welfare from the government, and are given only the minimal necessities for survival, while UNOI uses the funds for their own benefit (including free vacations in the Caribbean). UNOI members and their children are required to be educated by the UNOI, which does not instruct them in many basic skills or provide opportunity for accredited higher education. Members receive no health insurance and are not permitted to receive medical care outside that offered by the UNOI at Your Colonic Center, which does not include any physicians licensed in Kansas. At least one child of UNOI members has died without being taken to Kansas City emergency medical services.

The UNOI has also overstated its success—on one occasion stating that the Kansas City site is free of all crime, in the same month as a gunman fired twenty shots at a UNOI-run gas station. The Kansas City police department said it was unable to judge the effectiveness of UNOI in reducing crime. In 2002, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported five health violations at a UNOI-operated diner. In 2003, the gas station was the UNOI&#x27;s only profitable business.

===Jenkins family===
Jenkins has taken several wives from among his followers, including a teenaged stepdaughter (after having impregnated her). From these unions, he has fathered at least 15 children. Jenkins claims that he is justified in practicing polygamy, comparing himself to Solomon and claiming &quot;In the near future, a man will be known for his wisdom according to the number of wives that he has.&quot;

Notable among the UNOI&#x27;s critics are at least ten former members, including Moreen and Hanif Jenkins, two of Royall Jenkins&#x27; children from his first marriage. Hanif was a member of the UNOI for six months and then became a critic of its operations. Moreen joined the UNOI in 1985. She claimed that she married Joseph Kelly, one of the first members of the UNOI, and also studied UNOI theology for several hours a day for years. In 1997, Royall Jenkins declared that Kelly was a reincarnation of Elijah Muhammad, a claim that the NOI rejected. In 2002 Moreen Jenkins claimed her father threatened her life and the life of her youngest child after she attempted to apologize to the victim of a beating by UNOI members. She then took her infant child and left UNOI. Members continued to harass her. She stated that the UNOI was blocking her attempts to communicate with her other children and her attempts to gain custody. As of 2003, she had filed for divorce and still sought custody of her children. Moreen died at her home on October 14, 2008, shortly after her 45th birthday.

In 2003, the UNOI stated that Moreen Jenkins was &quot;operating out of vengeance, scorn, anger, desire and treachery&quot; and proposed that she seduced reporters with &quot;the guise of a scoop.&quot; In the same statement, Royall Jenkins is quoted as announcing &quot;the time when those who conspire against the rise of the Blackman —including Black women—will no longer be tolerated.&quot; After her death, Jenkins described his daughter as a traitor, stated &quot;the death of my daughter Moreen was more than justified&quot; and exhorted his followers not to mourn.

===Human trafficking===
In September 2017, Kendra Ross filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Kansas which alleged she had been forced to work without pay in businesses run by the UNOI and live in their homes for 10 years; was forcibly separated from her mother at age 12; ordered to marry another group member at age 20; and shipped against her will to various cities in different states before she escaped the group at age 21. In May 2018, after the group and its founder Royall Jenkins failed to respond to Ross’s lawsuit, the Kansas District Court entered a default judgment awarding Ross nearly $8 million in damages, which is thought to be the largest amount ever awarded in a human-trafficking case in U.S. history.

In June 2018, the United Nation of Islam was profiled on A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Cults &amp; Extreme Belief&quot;, a television show where host Elizabeth Vargas and others interview former members of organizations considered cults, talking to them about how they became involved and their allegations of abuse. In the episode, former members talk about their allegations of human trafficking, neglect and abuse, and unpaid labor of children in the group.

In September 2024, six former high ranking members of the cult were convicted of conspiracy to commit forced labor by a Kansas federal court.

<text>William Stetson Kennedy (October 5, 1916 – August 27, 2011) was an American author, folklorist and human rights activist. One of the pioneer folklore collectors during the first half of the 20th century, he is remembered for having infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s, exposing its secrets to authorities and the outside world. His actions led to the 1947 revocation by the state of Georgia of the Klan&#x27;s national corporate charter. Kennedy wrote or co-wrote ten books.

==Childhood and education==
William Stetson Kennedy, commonly known as Stetson Kennedy, was born on October 5, 1916, in the Springfield neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida to Willye Stetson and George Wallace Kennedy. A descendant of signers of the Declaration of Independence, Kennedy came from a wealthy, aristocratic Southern family with relatives including John Batterson Stetson, founder of the Stetson hat empire and namesake of Stetson University, and an uncle &quot;Brady&quot; who served as the head Klan official, or &quot;Great Titan&quot;, of a congressional district.

At a young age, Kennedy began collecting Florida folklore material and wrote poetry about Florida nature. His views on race relations in the South were largely influenced by his family&#x27;s black maid, known only as &quot;Flo&quot;, whom Kennedy considered &quot;almost like a mother&quot;. He recalled that during his childhood in the 1920s, local Klan members beat and raped Flo for &quot;sassing whitefolks&quot; after she questioned a white bus driver who had given her incorrect change. Recalling this incident later in life, Kennedy said, &quot;At a very tender age, I became aware that grownups were lying about a whole lot more than Santa Claus&quot;, in reference to the Klan&#x27;s claims of being Christian patriots.

Kennedy attended Jacksonville public schools and graduated from Robert E. Lee High School during the Great Depression. In 1935, he enrolled in University of Florida (UF), leaving in 1937 without receiving a degree. He also studied at the New School for Social Research in New York and at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.

==Early writing and activism==
In 1936, while studying at University of Florida, Kennedy collected boots and blankets for the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.

Kennedy has been called &quot;one of the pioneer folklore collectors during the first half of the 20th century&quot;. In 1937, he left the University of Florida to join the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, the federally funded Works Progress Administration (WPA) initiative created under the New Deal to fund and support American writers during the Great Depression. As part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, the Library of Congress hired archivists to document the diversity of American culture by recording regional folksongs (e.g., children&#x27;s songs, dance and gospel music) and oral histories in many languages and dialects. For five years, Kennedy collected Florida folklore, traveling throughout Florida alongside other notable figures such as Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston and folklorist Alan Lomax, among others. Kennedy had a large role in editing several volumes for the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, including &quot;The WPA Guide to Florida&quot; and &quot;A Guide to Key West&quot; of the WPA&#x27;s famed American Guide Series, and &quot;The Florida Negro&quot;.

At this time, Kennedy was contributing to periodicals like &quot;PM&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Common Ground&quot;, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, &quot;In Fact&quot;, &quot;Southern Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Southern Patriot&quot;. He also began writing &quot;Inside Out&quot; a column for the Federated Press that ran from 1937 to 1950. Kennedy coined the term &quot;Frown Power&quot;, when he started a campaign with that name in the 1940s, which simply encouraged people to pointedly frown when they heard bigoted speech.

Kennedy relied on unused material collected during his time with the Federal Writers&#x27; Project for his first book, &quot;Palmetto Country&quot; (1942). It was commissioned by Georgia writer Erskine Caldwell for the American Folkways Series. When it was published, Alan Lomax of the Library of Congress said, &quot;I very much doubt that a better book about Florida folklife will ever be written&quot;.

In 1942, Kennedy was an editorial director for the CIO&#x27;s political action committee. He wrote a series of monographs objecting to racist policies like poll taxes and white primaries because they were designed to disenfranchise minorities and poor people. Kennedy saw Southern fascist policies as part of an alliance with Northern industrialists to perpetuate a slavocracy, and this thesis was the basis of his second book, &quot;Southern Exposure&quot;.

==Infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan==
While working for the Writers Project, Kennedy often heard stories about the KKK&#x27;s terrorism. Because his bad back disqualified him for service in World War II, he decided to channel his patriotism towards combating racial injustices in the Jim Crow South. The Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith helped Kennedy establish a cover identity as John Perkins. From 1942 to 1946, he lived a double life as an employee of the CIO and as a white supremacist who joined up to 20 hate groups with names like White Front, Confederate Underground, and American Gentile Army.

Kennedy moved from Miami to Atlanta to target the highest rungs of the KKK. He volunteered for former Georgia Governor Eugene Talmadge, who had been voted out of office in 1942. Though not a member, Talmadge supported the KKK and often spoke at their events. Using Talmadge as a reference, Kennedy secured a sales job with the racist magazine &quot;The Southern Outlook&quot; and managed to join the Nathan Bedford Forrest Klavern #1 of the KKK.

With the help of other informants, Kennedy filed detailed reports on the Klavern&#x27;s Monday night meetings from September 1944 until November 1948. He also reported the Klan&#x27;s various crimes to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, as well as police, prosecutors, journalists, and human rights organizations.

A folklorist by habit, Kennedy documented how the Klan drew on fraternal organizations like the Elks and the Masons. He also relished the absurd flourishes of Klan lore, such as making &quot;K&quot; the initial letter for most terms, renaming the days of the week &quot;Dark, Deadly, Dismal, Doleful, Desolate, Dreadful, and Desperate&quot;, and their Byzantine handbook the Kloran. Kennedy decided to expose such &quot;Klankraft&quot; to public ridicule.

More importantly, Kennedy recognized that the KKK was operating in violation of its non-profit charter. In May 1946, he wrote to Governor Ellis Arnall with justifications for revoking it. By June, Arnall had announced his intention to cancel the charter. Georgia filed a &quot;quo warranto&quot; suit against the Klan, and the Klan surrendered its charter on June 13, 1947.

==Exposure of the KKK==
Kennedy was inspired by the success of &quot;Under Cover&quot;, John Roy Carlson&#x27;s exposé of American Nazis. In 1944, he was pitching a similar book organized around Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms, but it took another two years of revisions to convince Doubleday to publish &quot;Southern Exposure&quot;. The book was a bestseller and a critical favorite. The Institute for Southern Studies went so far as to name their journal after Kennedy&#x27;s book.

&quot;Southern Exposure&quot; is a survey of the politics of the South from the Civil War until the present, with a particular focus on labor practices and inequality. The book deals briefly and candidly with the Ku Klux Klan. Kennedy traveled to Chattanooga to interview J. B. Stoner, who did not realize the author was opposed to his work. Kennedy quotes Stoner&#x27;s unvarnished racism at length. He also includes images of original Klan paperwork like Forms K-111 and K-115, applications for reinstatement and &quot;Citizenship in the Invisible Empire&quot;. The book outraged the Klan and a bounty was put on Kennedy&#x27;s head.

Kennedy fed information to law enforcement and journalists in order to engineer counteractions against the Klan. He even showed up at the House Un-American Activities Committee in his Klan robe to get their attention. Having once called the KKK &quot;an old American institution&quot; after allowing Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott to testify, HUAC was uninterested in Kennedy&#x27;s information. His most high-profile media target was Drew Pearson who had a nationally syndicated column and a popular radio show. Pearson regularly broadcast intelligence from Kennedy. The Klan was irate to hear its machinations made public, such as Eugene Talmadge&#x27;s secret promise to appoint the KKK&#x27;s Atlanta Cyclops to run the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Pearson dubbed Kennedy &quot;the nation&#x27;s number-one Klanbuster&quot;.

===Superman===
On June 10, 1946, the highly popular Adventures of Superman radio show began a 16-episode story called &quot;The Clan of the Fiery Cross&quot;. The show had previously tackled hate groups as a subject. The writers approached the Anti-Defamation League about new foes for Superman. Kennedy claims he pitched the Klan as a subject.

By 1947, the ADL was claiming Kennedy was a consultant on the show. In &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Thomas Whiteside described Superman&#x27;s regular use of KKK passwords as a constant irritant to Grand Dragon Samuel Green, who was forced to listen to the show and update compromised codes. A myth took hold that the actual audio disproves. Superman never uses any code words as he takes on &quot;the Clan&quot;.

==The Klan Unmasked==
In early 1947, Stetson Kennedy&#x27;s undercover career as John Perkins ended when he was subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Homer Loomis and Emory Burke. Loomis ran an organization called the Columbians of Atlanta, a neo-Nazi terrorist organization that Kennedy infiltrated with other operatives. His fellow Columbians were shocked to see that Perkins was Kennedy, and they attacked him in the courthouse.

Kennedy spent the spring of 1947 on a lecture tour. He moved to Greenwich Village, because the Klan made his native South unsafe for him. In New York, he collaborated with photographer Marian Palfi on &quot;Jim Crow Guide to the U.S.A.&quot; He was also writing a manuscript titled &quot;I Rode With the Ku Klux Clan&quot;, which was reissued in 1990 as &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot;.

Unlike the journalistic &quot;Southern Exposure&quot;, where Kennedy occasionally appears in first person, &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot; is written as a potboiler. Having struggled since 1948 to get it published, Kennedy decided that turning it into a thriller was the best way to sell it. Writing in the style of Mickey Spillane, Kennedy is a hard-boiled witness to everything from the murder of a Black man by the KKK to the &quot;Wool Hat Putsch&quot; by Herman Talmadge.

In &quot;Southern Exposure&quot;, Kennedy slips into the first person to relate his trip to Stone Mountain to document a Klan rally. He recasts the event in &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot; as his formal initiation as a Klansman.

Kennedy also combined his exploits with those of other covert operatives in &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot;. For instance, he was one of three undercover Columbians. In the book, Kennedy combines all of their data gathering into a first person narrative where he is the main character. In addition to being a more marketable story, it helped Kennedy protect the identity of his collaborators.

He eventually identified one as John Brown, who was a disillusioned Klansman. Brown was able to penetrate the highest levels of the KKK, and many of the most gripping episodes in &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot; are presumed to have happened to him. Kennedy was acting as his handler, relaying his intelligence reports to the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League that was supporting their work.

===Criticism===
One Klan historian called Stetson Kennedy&#x27;s activism &quot;the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan.&quot; Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt amplified this overstatement in their 2005 book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;. When they learned about the fictional device in &quot;The Klan Unmasked&quot;, they retracted their error and revised the book.

Kennedy defended his work in several essays and interviews. Several of his colleagues and other historians supported Kennedy&#x27;s method.

==Later career==
Kennedy traveled to Geneva in 1950 and then to Paris. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote an introduction to the French translation of Kennedy&#x27;s Jim Crow book. Kennedy traveled extensively behind the Iron Curtain after he took the subway into East Berlin. He met Maria Tănase in Romania, visited the USSR, and Hungary. His passport expired while he was in Eastern Europe, and he was officially in police custody in Paris until he was issued a new one and was able to return to America.

In 1952, when Kennedy ran for governor of Florida, his friend and houseguest Woody Guthrie wrote a set of lyrics for a campaign song, &quot;Stetson Kennedy&quot;. The song was later set to music by Billy Bragg and recorded by Bragg and Jeff Tweedy&#x27;s band Wilco on the album &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot;.
A founding member and past president of the Florida Folklore Society, Kennedy was a recipient of the 1998 Florida Folk Heritage Award and the Florida Governor&#x27;s Heartland Award. Kennedy is also featured as one of the &quot;Whistle Blowers&quot;, in Studs Terkel&#x27;s book &quot;Coming of Age&quot;, published in 1995.

In 2007 St. Johns County declared a &quot;Stetson Kennedy Day&quot;.

Kennedy participated in the two-day &quot;New Deal Resources: Preserving the Legacy&quot; conference at the Library of Congress on the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the New Deal held in March 2008. Kennedy&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;Grits and Grunts: Folkloric Key West&quot;, was issued by the Pineapple Press, in 2008.

In February 2009, Kennedy bequeathed his personal library to the Civic Media Center in Gainesville, Florida with which Kennedy had worked since the center&#x27;s inception.

In October 2009, a first party for Kennedy&#x27;s 93rd birthday was held at the Civic Media Center and the next day admirers flocked to Beluthahatchee Park, now a landmarked historic site, to celebrate Kennedy&#x27;s birthday there.

==Personal life==
According to friends, he was married seven times, though Kennedy only admitted to five marriages, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ll leave it to the historians to decide how many times I&#x27;ve been married.&quot; His first marriage was in 1936 to Edith Ogden-Aguilar, a Cuban émigré he met in Key West, Florida while doing fieldwork for his own writing shortly after leaving UF.

In 1942, he had a son, Loren Stetson Kennedy, his only child.

After fleeing Budapest with his Hungarian wife during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Kennedy was held in detention in Paris for over a year after his passport was confiscated by the U.S. government due to McCarthyism.

In 2006, at 90 years old, Kennedy married writer and bookstore owner Sandra Parks, a former city commissioner of St. Augustine, Florida. They remained married until Kennedy died in 2011.

==Legacy==
===Beluthahatchee Park===
In 2003, Friends of Libraries USA put Beluthahatchee on its national register of literary sites and, to commemorate the occasion, Arlo Guthrie gave a concert in Jacksonville.

In 2005 Kennedy received a life estate on his 4-acre homestead in Saint Johns County, and it is now Beluthahatchee Park.

The name &quot;Beluthahatchee&quot; describes a mythical &quot;Florida Shangri-la, where all unpleasantness is forgiven and forgotten&quot; according to Zora Neale Hurston.

Among the amenities are a picnic pavilion, canoe dock, access to the Beluthahatchee Lake, and use of the two wildlife observation platforms. A &quot;Mother Earth Trail&quot; throughout the property is planned, as envisioned by the Kennedy Foundation. The Park&#x27;s perimeter is surrounded by a heavy canopy of native vegetation and the enclave provides a habitat for wildlife and continues to serve as a rookery and roosting place for many types of waterfowl and other birds.

Kennedy&#x27;s home has, upon his death, been opened as a museum and archive and offer educational exhibits, primarily about Woody Guthrie and William Bartram in addition to Kennedy himself, and has been operated by the Kennedy Foundation which shares office space in an adjacent home with the William Bartram Scenic and Historic Highway corridor group. A log cabin that&#x27;s in the park may serve as a caretaker residence while the fourth building there may house an Artist-in-Residence through the Florida Folklife program.

The park is part of a 70-acre tract that Kennedy purchased in 1948, recorded restrictive covenants setting aside land in perpetuity as a wildlife refuge, and the following year subdivided, subsequently selling all but his own 4 acre parcel.

===Death and memorials===
 Kennedy died on August 27, 2011, at Baptist Medical Center South in Jacksonville, Florida, where he had been in palliative care for several days.

Kennedy&#x27;s stated wishes were that upon his death a party should be held rather than a funeral; therefore, a celebration of Kennedy&#x27;s life was held on October 1, 2011 (four days before Kennedy&#x27;s 95th birthday) at Kennedy&#x27;s homestead, Beluthahatchee Park. Several hundred relatives, friends, and admirers gathered for the events which commenced with an hour of musical performances. The performances included several pieces written by Kennedy&#x27;s friend Woody Guthrie, who composed many songs at Beluthahatchee, including several about Kennedy, e.g., &quot;Beluthahatchee Bill&quot;, culminating with all present singing Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;. This was followed by an hour of eulogies. Then all present walked down to Lake Beluthahatchee and viewed Kennedy&#x27;s ashes being scattered thereon from a canoe.

<text>In Persian, Turkic and Urdu poetry, the matla″ (from Arabic ; ; ; ; ; ) is the first &quot;bayt&quot;, or couplet, of a &quot;ghazal&quot;. In this sense, it is the opposite of the &quot;maqta&#x27;&quot;. It is possible, although extremely rare, for there to be more than one &quot;matla″&quot; in a &quot;ghazal&quot;; in this case the second is referred to as husn e Matla. It is important part because it establishes the overall form and mood of the entire &quot;ghazal&quot;. 

The defining feature of the &quot;matla″&quot; is that both verses of the couplet rhyme, or expressed in technical terminology, both verses end with the &quot;qafiya&quot; and &quot;radif&quot; of the &quot;ghazal&quot;. In fact, the purpose of the &quot;matla″&quot; is to define the qafiya and radif for the rest of the &quot;ghazal&quot;.

<text>Chiang Yee (; 19 May 1903 – 26 October 1977), self-styled as &quot;The Silent Traveller&quot; (哑行者), was a Chinese poet, author, painter and calligrapher. The success of &quot;The Silent Traveller: A Chinese Artist in Lakeland&quot; (1937) was followed by a series of books in the same vein, all of which he illustrated himself. He was a nominee for the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==1903–1933: China==
Chiang Yee was born in Jiujiang, China, on a day variously recorded as 19 May or 14 June. His father was a painter. His mother died when he was five.

Chiang Yee married Tseng Yun in 1924, with whom he was to have four children. In 1925 he graduated from Nanjing University (then named National Southeastern University), one of the world&#x27;s oldest institutions of learning but also relaunched in 1920 as one of China&#x27;s earlier modern universities; his degree was in chemistry. He served for over a year in the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, then taught chemistry in middle schools, lectured at National Chengchi University, and worked as assistant editor of a Hangzhou newspaper. He subsequently served as magistrate of three counties (Jiujang in Jiangxi, and Dangtu and Wuhu in Anhui). Unhappy with the situation in China then (see Nanjing decade), he departed for England in 1933, to study for an MSc in economics at the London School of Economics, focusing on English local government, leaving wife and family behind. He did not complete the MSc.

==1933–1955: England==
From 1935 to 1938 Chiang taught Chinese at the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies), University of London, and 1938 to 1940 worked at the Wellcome Museum of Anatomy and Pathology. During this period, he wrote and illustrated a well-received series of books entitled &quot;The Silent Traveller in...&quot;. His first was &quot;The Silent Traveller: a Chinese Artist in Lakeland&quot;, written from a journal of a fortnight in the English Lake District in August 1936). Others followed: The Silent Traveller in London, the Yorkshire Dales, and Oxford. Despite paper shortages and rationing, these books were kept in print. He wrote &quot;The Silent Traveller in Wartime&quot;, and, after World War II ended, the series gradually ventured further afield, to Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Boston, concluding in 1972 with Japan. He lived for a time with fellow expatriates Hsiung Shih-I, author of a West End hit, and Dymia Hsiung, the first Chinese woman to write a fictionalised autobiography in English.

After publication of the Silent Traveller books, Chiang became friends with a number of British intellectuals and people involved in the arts. Ninette de Valois commissioned him to design the costumes for a performance of the ballet &quot;The Birds&quot;.

People he knew in Britain included Dorothea Hosie, Basil Gray, Noel Carrington, John Laviers Wheatley, Elizabeth Longford, Gilbert Murray and Strickland Gibson.

===Commentary on his writing: 1933–1955===
The books bring a fresh &#x27;sideways look&#x27; to places perhaps unfamiliar at the time to a Chinese national: the author was struck by things the locals might not notice, such as beards, or the fact that the so-called Lion&#x27;s Haunch on Arthur&#x27;s Seat in Edinburgh is actually far more like a sleeping elephant. In his wartime books, Chiang Yee made it plain that he was fervently opposed to Nazism. His writings exude a feeling of positive curiosity. Some of his books have been re-issued in recent decades, at times with fresh introductions. Godfrey Hodgson noted Chiang Yee&#x27;s irony and his comments on British racism. In &quot;The Silent Traveller in Oxford&quot; (1944), Chiang points out that Chinese people are not allowed to enter Trinity College, Oxford. He describes feeling homesick for China. He writes about the natural world, particularly flowers.

==1955–1975: United States==
After living for some years in a small flat in London and being obliged, during the war, neither to travel nor to take part in the hostilities, on account of being classed as an &#x27;alien&#x27;, Chiang moved to the United States in 1955. He became a lecturer (and ultimately Emeritus Professor of Chinese) at Columbia University from 1955 to 1957, with an interlude in 1958 and 1959 during which he was Emerson Fellow in Poetry at Harvard University. He became a naturalized citizen in 1966. He illustrated all his books, including several for children, and he wrote a standard work on Chinese calligraphy.

==1975–1977: China==
Chiang died in his seventies in China after spending over forty years away from his homeland, on a day variously recorded as 7 or 26 October 1977. His tomb is on the slopes of Mount Lu nearby his home town Jiujiang.

== Commemoration ==
In June 2019, 40 years after Chiang&#x27;s death, a blue plaque was unveiled at 28 Southmoor Road, Oxford where he rented two rooms from 1940 to 1955. The plaque honours his contribution to British and Chinese life. He is thought to be only the third Chinese person to receive a blue plaque, i.e. a memorial created by English Heritage. (Writer Lao She has a blue plaque in Notting Hill and Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China, is commemorated in the village of Cottered in Hertfordshire.)

<text>Chang Dai-chien or Zhang Daqian (; 10 May 1899 – 2 April 1983) was one of the best-known and most prodigious Chinese artists of the twentieth century. Originally known as a &quot;guohua&quot; (traditionalist) painter, by the 1960s he was also renowned as a modern impressionist and expressionist painter. In addition, he is regarded as one of the most gifted master forgers of the twentieth century.

==Background==
Chang was born in 1899 in Sichuan Province to a financially struggling but artistic family, whose members had converted to Roman Catholicism. His first commission came at age 12, when a traveling fortune-teller requested he paint her a new set of divining cards. At age 17 he was captured by bandits while returning home from boarding school in Chongqing. When the bandit chief ordered him to write a letter home demanding a ransom, he was so impressed by the boy&#x27;s brushmanship that he made the boy his personal secretary. During the more than three months that he was held captive, he read books of poetry which the bandits had looted from raided homes.

In 1917, Chang moved to Kyoto to learn textile dyeing techniques. He later returned to Shanghai in 1919 and established a successful career selling his paintings.

The governor of Qinghai, Ma Bufang, sent Chang to Sku&#x27;bum to seek helpers for analyzing and copying Dunhuang&#x27;s Buddhist art.

Due to the political climate of China in 1949, he left the country and then moved to Mendoza, Argentina in 1952. Two years later, he resided in São Paulo, Brazil.

In the 1967 Chang settled in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. During their stay, he and his wife lodged at the Dolores Lodge, owned by Thomas Chew and currently known as the Carmel Country Inn, situated at the intersection of Dolores Street and 3rd Avenue. They stayed in a distinctive cabin that had a set of connected rooms. By 1968, they had relocated to their personal residence, which the artist dubbed &#x27;K&#x27;e-yi Chu&#x27; - meaning &quot;barely habitable&quot; or &quot;just okay&quot; when translated. Their home was situated on the western side of Crespi Avenue, precisely six houses south of Mountain View Avenue.

They toured extensively around Northern California. Chang&#x27;s first California solo exhibition in 1967 at Stanford University attracted an opening reception crowd of a thousand. Finally he settled in Taipei, Taiwan in 1978. During his years of wandering he had several wives simultaneously, curried favor with influential people, and maintained a large entourage of relatives and supporters. He also kept a pet gibbon. He affected the long robe and long beard of a scholar.

A meeting between Chang and Picasso in Nice, France in 1956 was viewed as a summit between the preeminent masters of Eastern and Western art. The two men exchanged paintings at this meeting.

==Artistic career==
In the early 1920s, Chang started pursuing professional studies in Shanghai, where he studied with two famous artists, Zeng Xi and Li Ruiqing. His elder brother Zhang Shanzi, who was a famous painter at the time, brought him to a literary salon in 1924 where his first appearance impressed the attendants. His first exhibition of 100 paintings was in 1925 at Ningbo Association in Shanghai.

In the late 1920s and 1930s, Chang moved to Beijing where he befriended other famous artists, including Yu Feian, Wang Shensheng, Ye Qianyu, Chen Banding, Qi Baishi, and Pu Xinyu. Chang had collaborated with Pu on painting and calligraphy. At the time, there was an idiom &quot;Chang from the south, Pu from the north (南張北溥)&quot; for those two of the most renowned artists in China. There was also a saying that Chang was &quot;southern counterpart of Pu Xinyu in shan-shui painting, Qi Baishi in flower-and-bird painting, and Xu Cao in figure painting&quot;.

In the 1930s he worked out of a studio on the grounds of the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou. In 1933, while an exhibition of modern Chinese paintings organized by Xu Beihong was held in Paris, France, and Zhang&#x27;s exhibited painting &quot;Golden Lotus (金荷)&quot; was purchased by the French government. In 1935, he accepted the invitation from Xu Beihong to be a professor at National Central University Art Department in Nanjing. In the same year, his portfolio was published in Shanghai. In 1936, his personal exhibition was held in the United Kingdom.

In the early 1940s, Chang led a group of artists in copying the Buddhist wall paintings in the Mogao and Yulin caves. In order to copy the inner layer of the multilayered murals in the Mogao Caves, Chang removed and damaged several outer layers of the paintings in Cave 108, 130 and 454. In 1943, he exhibited his copies of murals and supported the establishment of the Dunhuang Art Institute, the predecessor of the Dunhuang Research Academy. In 1945, Chang&#x27;s works, as a part of a UNESCO&#x27;s touring contemporary art exhibition, were shown in Paris, London, Prague and Geneva.

In the late 1950s, his deteriorating eyesight led him to develop his splashed color, or &quot;pocai&quot;, style, which combines abstract expressionism with traditional Chinese styles of painting. In the 1970s, he mentored painter Minol Araki.

In 1957, Zhang Daqian was invited to hold exhibitions in The Louvre and Musée Guimet in Paris, where Picasso was also holding a show. Zhang seized this opportunity to meet with him. Picasso was delighted to meet Zhang and even asked him to criticise his Chinese paintings. Zhang directly told Picasso that he did not have the right brushes to do Chinese art. Ten years later, Picasso received a gift from Zhang– two Chinese writing brushes made from the hair of 2500 three-year-old cows.

==Forgeries==
Chang&#x27;s forgeries are difficult to detect for many reasons. First, his ability to mimic the great Chinese masters:

Second, he paid scrupulous attention to the materials he used. &quot;He studied paper, ink, brushes, pigments, seals, seal paste, and scroll mountings in exacting detail. When he wrote an inscription on a painting, he sometimes included a postscript describing the type of paper, the age and the origin of the ink, or the provenance of the pigments he had used.&quot;

Third, he often forged paintings based on descriptions in catalogues of lost paintings; his forgeries came with ready-made provenance.

Chang&#x27;s forgeries have been purchased as original paintings by several major art museums in the United States, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston:

It can be hard to attribute works to Chang since his style was so varied. Not only did he create his own work as well as forging other artists, but others would forge his originals.

Additionally, in China, &quot;forgery&quot; does not hold the same nefarious connotation as it does in Western culture. What would be considered illegal forgery in the United States is not necessarily as criminal in China. Actions he took to fall under the Western definition of forgery include aging work with electric hairdryers, and creating fake provenance with his collection of seals that he could use to mark past &quot;owners&quot; of the work. To further this provenance, his friend Puru would provide a colophon authenticating the work&#x27;s imperial origins.

Art historian James Cahill claimed that the painting &quot;The Riverbank&quot;, a masterpiece from the Southern Tang dynasty, held by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, was likely another Chang forgery. The silk the piece is painted on could be carbon dated to help authenticate it, however since there has been some restoration on it—the border repaired and the painting remounted and reglued—not only would getting a sample to test be difficult, but there would be no guarantee the sample only contains original material.

Museum curators are cautioned to examine Chinese paintings of questionable origins, especially those from the bird and flower genre with the query, &quot;Could this be by Chang Dai-chien?&quot; Joseph Chang, Curator of Chinese Art at the Sackler Museum, suggested that many notable collections of Chinese art contained forgeries by the master painter.

It is estimated that Chang made more than 10 million dollars selling his forgeries.

<doc id="1178286" wikidata="Q2225347" url="?curid=1178286" title="Socialist feminism">
<text>Socialist feminism rose in the 1960s and 1970s as an offshoot of the feminist movement and New Left that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the patriarchy and capitalism. However, the ways in which women&#x27;s private, domestic, and public roles in society has been conceptualized, or thought about, can be traced back to Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792) and William Thompson&#x27;s utopian socialist work in the 1800s. Ideas about overcoming the patriarchy by coming together in female groups to talk about personal problems stem from Carol Hanisch. This was done in an essay in 1969 which later coined the term &#x27;the personal is political.&#x27; This was also the time that second wave feminism started to surface which is really when socialist feminism kicked off. Socialist feminists argue that liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women&#x27;s oppression.

Socialist feminism is a two-pronged theory that broadens Marxist feminism&#x27;s argument for the role of capitalism in the oppression of women and radical feminism&#x27;s theory of the role of gender and the patriarchy. Socialist feminists reject radical feminism&#x27;s main claim that patriarchy is the only, or primary, source of oppression of women. Rather, Socialist feminists assert that women are oppressed due to their financial dependence on males. Women are subjects to male domination within capitalism due to an uneven balance in wealth. They see economic dependence as the driving force of women&#x27;s subjugation to men. Further, Socialist feminists see women&#x27;s liberation as a necessary part of a larger quest for social, economic, and political justice. Socialist feminists attempted to integrate the fight for women&#x27;s liberation with the struggle against other oppressive systems based on race, class, sexual orientation, or economic status.
Socialist feminism draws upon many concepts found in Marxism, such as a historical materialist point of view, which means that they relate their ideas to the material and historical conditions of people&#x27;s lives. Thus, Socialist feminists consider how the sexism and gendered division of labor of each historical era is determined by the economic system of the time. Those conditions are largely expressed through capitalist and patriarchal relations. Socialist feminists reject the Orthodox Marxist notion that class and class struggle are the only defining aspects of history and economic development. Although Marx may have prioritised class oppression as the subject of his study and did not talk about female emancipation often, he did treat it as an issue in its own right. One place that this is shown is in his third Parisian manuscript of 1844, where he states that &quot;marriage is a form of exclusive private property&quot;, and condones treating women &quot;as the prey and servant of social lust&quot;. Despite some claims, he has never been found to argue that the creation of a classless society would lead to gender oppression vanishing; instead evidence exists which suggest that he viewed female struggles as something independent. However due to his writing on women being scarce, the tradition and works of Marxist Feminism is one constructed through the works of the many feminist Marxist&#x27;s that came after; either through reinterpreting his original writings or providing their own theories to the foundation he provided. Much of this work has gone towards specifying how gender and class work together to create distinct forms of oppression and privilege for women and men of each class. For example, they observe that women&#x27;s class status is generally derivative of her husband&#x27;s class or occupational status, e.g. a secretary that marries her boss assumes his class status.

In 1972, &quot;Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;, which is believed to be the first publication to use the term socialist feminism, was published by the Hyde Park Chapter of the Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union (Heather Booth, Day Creamer, Susan Davis, Deb Dobbin, Robin Kaufman, and Tobey Klass). Other socialist feminists, notably two long-lived American organizations Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, point to the classic Marxist writings of Frederick Engels (&quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;) and August Bebel (&quot;Woman and Socialism&quot;) as a powerful explanation of the link between gender oppression and class exploitation. In the decades following the Cold War, feminist writer and scholar Sarah Evans says that the socialist feminist movement has lost traction in the West due to a common narrative that associates socialism with totalitarianism and dogma.

Post-1970, the socialist feminist movement continued to grow. In &quot;Socialist Women: European Socialist Feminism in the Nineteenth &amp; early Twentieth Centuries,&quot; by Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy, social feminism is defined as &quot;women who saw the root of sexual oppression in the existence of private property and who envisioned a radically transformed society in which man would exploit neither man nor women&quot; The equality described has to do with a transformed society in which both sexes are equal and given the same opportunities despite any physiological differences. Going forward it is described to need a total change in both the economic and social system to create the lasting improvement that the socialist feminism movement is looking for.

Kristen Ghodsee argues in her book &quot;Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism&quot; that free markets discriminate against women as big bosses consider women to be less reliable, weaker and more emotional which leads to the gender pay gap as they need financial incentives to employ them.
George Bernard Shaw quotes &quot;Capitalism acts on women as a continual bribe to enter into sex relations for money&quot;. He also claims many women take part in work within the household but this is invisible as far as the market is concerned.

== Core issues ==

=== Intersectionality ===

Socialist feminist Claudia Jones worked to incorporate Black women, other working women of color, and their needs into The Communist Party in the 1930s. This is because The Communist Party tended to default to issues of the white, male proletariat. Jones theoretical background rests at the intersection of Marxism, Black Nationalism, and Feminism and she is credited with theorizing &quot;triple oppression&quot;, the concept that Black and Brown women experience oppression based on race, class, and gender. Jones further argues that white women, much less Black and Brown working women, would never be liberated if the structures of colonialism were not abolished and Black Nationalism were not adopted.

Feminist historian Linda Gordon asserts that socialist feminism is inherently intersectional, at least to a certain degree, because it takes into account both gender and class. Gordon says that because the foundation of socialist feminism rests on multiple axes, socialist feminism has a history of intersectionality that can be traced back to a period decades before Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw first articulated the concept of intersectionality in 1989. According to Gordon, socialist feminism of the 1980s presaged the concept of intersectionality by examining the overlapping structures that produce an individual&#x27;s experience of oppression. Feminist scholar and women&#x27;s studies professor Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy says that this broader analysis of societal structures began with socialist feminism and served as a catalyst for feminist scholarship. Kennedy says that many of the first women&#x27;s studies programs were established by socialist feminist theorists. Despite the claims of being a homogenizing philosophy that erases difference of identity, socialist feminism&#x27;s inherent approach to difference of identities, through an analysis of economic exploitation of all, is both recognized and enhanced by Crenshaw&#x27;s intersectionality.

Despite the alleged presence of intersectionality in socialist feminism, many feminists, particularly women of color, critique the movement for perceived deficiencies in regards to racial equity. In Kennedy&#x27;s account of socialist feminism&#x27;s impact on women&#x27;s studies, she says that a lack of Black voices in feminist academia contributed to whitewashing of women&#x27;s studies programs and courses. Kum-Kum Bhavani, a professor at University of California Santa Barbara, and Margaret Coulson, a socialist feminist scholar, assert that racism in the socialist feminist movement stems from the failure of many white feminists to recognize the institutional nature of racism. According to Bhavani and Coulson, race, class, and gender are inextricably linked, and the exclusion of any one of these factors from one&#x27;s worldview would result in an incomplete understanding of the systems of privilege and oppression they say constitute our society. Kathryn Harriss, a feminist scholar from the United Kingdom, describes what she sees as the shortcomings of the socialist feminist movement of the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Harriss describes marginalized women&#x27;s grievances with the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement. She says many lesbian women criticized the movement for its domination by heterosexual feminists who perpetuated heterosexism in the movement. Similarly, Black women asserted that they were deprived a voice due to the overwhelming majority of white women in the WLM advocating widely held views regarding violence against women, the family, and reproductive rights that failed to account for the distinct struggles faced by women of color.

=== Motherhood and the private sphere ===
Theorists Anna Wheeler and William Thompson, in &quot;The Appeal of One Half the Human Race, Women, Against the Pretensions of the Other Half, Men, to Retain Them in Political, and thence in Civil and Domestic Slavery&quot;, published in 1825, describe how women&#x27;s work contributes to capitalism&#x27;s continuance. They assert that cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, and all other activities that are deemed domestic work do constitute as actual work. Wheeler and Thompson assert that people, or labor, are needed for capitalism to function and that without women producing children as well as fulfilling these domestic activities, capitalism would fail.

Flora Tristian, French socialist activist, in her piece &quot;Why I mention Women&quot; published in 1843, argued that women and girls do not receive education because they are tasked with domestic duties. Girls and women, according to Tristan, thus cannot obtain gainful employment outside of the domestic sphere due to their neglect in their education and forced preoccupation with cleaning, cooking, and tending to children.

Socialist feminists highlight how motherhood and the gendered division of labor grows &quot;naturally&quot; from women&#x27;s role as mothers, is the source of women&#x27;s exclusion from the public sphere, and creates women&#x27;s economic dependence on men. They assert that there is nothing natural about the gendered division of labor and show that the expectation that women perform all or most reproductive labor, i.e. labor associated with birthing and raising children but also the cleaning, cooking, and other tasks necessary to support human life, deny women the capacity to participate fully in economic activity outside the home. In order to free themselves from the conditions of work as a mother and housekeeper, socialist feminists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman saw the professionalization of housework as key. This would be done by hiring professional nannies and housekeepers to take the load of domestic work away from the woman in the house. Perkins Gilman also recommended the redesign of homes in ways that would maximize their potential for creativity and leisure for women as well as men, i.e. emphasizing the need for rooms like studios and studies and eliminating kitchens and dining rooms. These changes would necessitate the communalization of meal preparation and consumption outside the home and free women from their burden of providing meals on a house-by-house scale.

===Toxic masculinity===
Socialist feminists claim that toxic masculinity is not only damaging to men but also women and non-binary people. Toxic masculinity is the idea that men should behave in a specific way, most commonly these behaviors are strong and with hold emotion (Salam, Maya). For example, in Latinx culture toxic masculinity is referred to as &quot;Machismo&quot; (FEM Magazine). Machismo keeps men in their designated masculine roles while women are given the submissive role. Machismo enforces the idea that men are the superior gender and women are second class citizens. The pressure on men to adhere to gender roles and in particular a gender binary feeds to the crisis of male suicide, rape culture and the normalization of violence. Socialist feminist politics aims to say this normalized behavior is just another part of gender construction the patriarchy has just created to harm women.

Toxic masculinity can be observed in everyday life such as (FEM Magazine). Locker room talk is an excuse for men to spew comments about women that are most commonly sexual. Because these men are in a certain environment, this behavior is normalized. However, locker room talk is extremely harmful especially because it enforces the gender hierarchy that socialist feminism aims to diminish. Another example in which exemplifies toxic masculinity is the phrase &quot;boys will be boys&quot;. This term is usually used to justify an action of a male that is rude or inappropriate which in turn harms women because it makes exceptions for men to behavior however they please. These examples enforce the behaviors that are sexist and give a false idea to men that they are allowed to treat women however they want.

Toxic masculinity has become a more popular issue to discuss among feminists due to the increase of popular male influencers that promote the behaviors and mindsets of toxic masculinity. Males will go on social media platforms such as TikTok, and share their harmful ideas about how women should be behaving. This has become a major issue among feminists today, and trends on TikTok have been curated to combat toxic masculinity. For example, the #97% trend was created for women to share their stores about sexual harassment. 97% of women will experience some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime, and therefore this trend shows that women suffer immensely at the hands of men.

=== Gender pay gap ===
Socialist feminist theories have been used to highlight the economic disparities amongst women on a global scale. Contemporary socialist feminists have shifted their concerns from uncompensated house labor to the insufficient pay women receive for work done outside the home. Although some women have secured high-paying male-dominated jobs, most find work in service, clerical, agriculture, and light industrial work. Feminist philosopher Rosemarie Tong presents three common reasons for the gender wage gap: &quot;the concentration of women in low-paying, female-dominated jobs; the high percentage of women who work part-time rather than full-time; and outright wage discrimination against women.&quot;

The gender pay gap has been produced and sustained through patriarchal and capitalist conditions. The feminization and devaluation of service-based jobs have subjected women to low wages. The lack of access women have to alternative employment which may harbor higher pay, has increased the wage gap. Households that cannot hire additional aid for domestic duties limit the hours women are able to work outside their homes—having to do both outside and inside labor results in the uncompensated &quot;second shift&quot;, expanding the gap. Women&#x27;s work is considered &quot;secondary wages&quot; under patriarchy. Even women who can work full-time and do the same jobs as men are not paid equally. Tong claims that &quot;women are paid less simply because they are &quot;women,&quot; a very disturbing thought to say the least.&quot;

The gender pay gap is an issue that is especially prevalent in the United States. In &quot;Feminist Policy and Human Nature&quot;, Allison Jagger describes the biological differences between women and men that would affect job performance namely &quot;Most evidently, women&#x27;s reproductive functions may mean that women have needs for pregnancy leave, maternity services and arrangements for easy access to their nursing babies.&quot; This fact insists that it is not only important but it is necessary for the workplace to incorporate this fairly into contracts. Forcing women to take unpaid maternity leave goes into the issue of the gender wage gap since women have reproductive needs that go far beyond men but are not compensated for that.

In looking at the amount of unpaid labor that women have worked over centuries is a major issue regarding unpaid labor in the house and in childcare. Women in capitalism are not compensated for their role in the household including housework, cooking, cleaning, childcare and the cost of carrying and delivering a child. &quot;Contracts for husbands to pay their wives for domestic services have been found invalid by the courts. If housewives do not like the conditions of their work they are hardly free to move to another household; instead, they are tied by an elaborate legal contract which can only be broken on special grounds. Marriage is, in fact, a relation that is remarkably similar to the feudal relation of vassalage; it provides a means for exchanging support and protection from the husband in return for services and devotion from the wife.&quot; The idea of a contract for husbands to pay their wives is an exaggerated circumstance yet for decades it was the expectation that the woman would be considered a housewife and the man would be the breadwinner and make decisions for the family. This idea of women&#x27;s unpaid labor is more than simply the housework and childcare services; it&#x27;s the fact that the labor housewives did was considered compulsory instead of labor. This is the type of thinking and mentality that the socialist feminism and women who want more of these

In 2017, there was an international women&#x27;s strike protesting the unfair treatment of women in today&#x27;s society. The strike included over 50 countries and occurred on international women&#x27;s day. The strikes in each country were focused on an injustice in that specific country. In the United States women protested by not working or spending money to show how much influence women have.

== Sub-theories of socialist feminism ==

=== Anarcha-feminism ===
Anarcha-feminism, also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism, combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. L. Susan Brown claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;. Bakunin opposed patriarchy and the way the law &quot;subjects [women] to the absolute domination of the man&quot;. He argued that &quot;[e]qual rights must belong to men and women&quot; so that women can &quot;become independent and be free to forge their own way of life&quot;. Bakunin foresaw the end of &quot;the authoritarian juridical family&quot; and &quot;the full sexual freedom of women.&quot;

Anarcha-feminism began with late 19th and early 20th century authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Lucy Parsons. In the Spanish Civil War, an anarcha-feminist group, (Free Women) linked to the , organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas, while the prominent Spanish anarchist and feminist leader Federica Montseny held that the &quot;emancipation of women would lead to a quicker realization of the social revolution&quot; and that &quot;the revolution against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant &#x27;future-women.&#x27; According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica Montseny&#x27;s, women could realize through art and literature the need to revise their own roles.&quot;

In Argentina, Virginia Bolten is responsible for the publication of a newspaper called &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Woman&#x27;s Voice&quot;), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in Montevideo, which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it after her deportation. &quot;La Voz de la Mujer described itself as &quot;dedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism&quot;. Its central theme was that of the multiple nature of women&#x27;s oppression. An editorial asserted, &quot;We believe that in present-day society nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women.&quot; Women, they said, were doubly oppressed—by bourgeois society and by men. Its feminism can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender oppression. Marriage was a bourgeois institution which restricted women&#x27;s freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire, oppression of women by men they hated—all were seen as symptomatic of the coercion implied by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individual&#x27;s will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then, and more thoroughly, through social revolution.&quot;

 was an anarchist women&#x27;s organization in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of a &quot;double struggle&quot; for women&#x27;s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Flying day-care centres were set up in efforts to involve more women in union activities. Lucía Sánchez Saornil, was a Spanish poet, militant anarchist and feminist. She is best known as one of the founders of &quot;Mujeres Libres&quot; and served in the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA). By 1919, she had been published in a variety of journals, including &quot;Los Quijotes&quot;, &quot;Tableros&quot;, &quot;Plural&quot;, &quot;Manantial&quot; and &quot;La Gaceta Literaria&quot;. Working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment. Writing in anarchist publications such as &quot;Earth and Freedom&quot;, the &quot;White Magazine&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27; Solidarity&quot;, Lucía outlined her perspective as a feminist.

In the past decades, two films have been produced about anarcha-feminism. &quot;Libertarias&quot; is a historical drama made in 1996 about the Spanish anarcha-feminist organization Mujeres Libres. In 2010, the Argentinian film &quot;Ni dios, ni patrón, ni marido&quot; was released which is centered on the story of anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten and her publishing of &quot;La Voz de la Mujer&quot;.

=== Marxist feminism ===

Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the social institutions of private property and capitalism to explain and criticize gender inequality and oppression. According to Marxist feminists, private property gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political and domestic struggle between the sexes, and is the root of women&#x27;s oppression in the current social context.

Marxist feminism&#x27;s foundation is laid by Friedrich Engels in his analysis of gender oppression in &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State&quot; (1884). He argues that a woman&#x27;s subordination is not a result of her biological disposition but of social relations, and that men&#x27;s efforts to achieve their demands for control of women&#x27;s labor and sexual faculties have gradually solidified and become institutionalized in the nuclear family. Through a Marxist historical perspective, Engels analyzes the widespread social phenomena associated with female sexual morality, such as fixation on virginity and sexual purity, incrimination and violent punishment of women who commit adultery, and demands that women be submissive to their husbands. Ultimately, Engels traces these phenomena to the recent development of exclusive control of private property by the patriarchs of the rising slaveowner class in the ancient mode of production, and the attendant desire to ensure that their inheritance is passed only to their own offspring: chastity and fidelity are rewarded, says Engels, because they guarantee exclusive access to the sexual and reproductive faculty of women possessed by men from the property-owning class.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, both Clara Zetkin and Eleanor Marx were against the demonization of men and supported a proletariat revolution that would overcome as many male–female inequalities as possible. In this way, a politic of solidarity was seen as the means to enact a socialist platform. As their movement already had the most radical demands in women&#x27;s equality, most Marxist leaders, including Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai, counterposed Marxism against bourgeois feminism, rather than trying to combine them.

Orthodox Marxists argue that most Marxist forerunners claimed by feminists or Marxist feminists including Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai were against capitalist forms of feminism. They agreed with the main Marxist movement that feminism was a bourgeois ideology counterposed to Marxism and against the working class. Instead of feminism, the Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Orthodox Marxists view the later attempt to combine Marxism and feminism as a liberal creation of academics and reformist leftists who want to make alliances with bourgeois feminists. For instance, Alexandra Kollontai wrote in 1909: For what reason, then, should the woman worker seek a union with the bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker.Kollontai was a prominent leader in the Bolshevik party in Russia, defending her stance on how capitalism had shaped a rather displeasing and oppressing position for females that are part of its system. She recognized and emphasized the difference between the proletariat and bourgeoise women in society, though it has been expressed by Kollontai&#x27;s thought that all women under a capitalist economy were those of oppression. One of the reasons Kollontai had a strict opposition of the bourgeois women and proletariat or working-class women to have an alliance is because the bourgeois was still inherently using the women of the working class to their advantage, and therefore prolonging the injustice that women in a capitalist society are treated. She theorized that a well-balanced economic utopia was ingrained in the need for gender equality, but never identified as a feminist, though she greatly impacted the feminist movement within the ideology of feminism within and throughout socialism. Kollontai had a harsh stance on the feminist movement and believed feminist to be naïve in only addressing gender as the reason inequality was happening under a capitalist rule. She believed that the true issue of inequality was that of the division of classes that led to the immediate production of gender struggles, just how men in the structure of the classes shown a harsh divide as well. Kollontai analyzed the theories and historical implications of Marxism as a background for her ideologies, which she addressed the most profound obstacle for society to address be that of the gender inequality, which could never be eradicated under a capitalist society. As capitalism is inherently for private profit, Kollontai&#x27;s argument toward the eradication of women suffrage within society under a capitalist rule also delved into how women cannot and will not be abolished under a capitalist society because of the ways in which women&#x27;s &quot;free labor&quot; has been utilized. Kollontai criticized the feminist movement as also neglecting to emphasize how the working class, while trying to care and provide for a family and being paid less than that of men, was still expected to cater to and provide for the bourgeois or upper-class women who were still oppressing the working-class women by utilizing their stereotypical type of work. Kollontai also faced harsh scrutiny in being a woman leader in a time of a male dominated political stance during the Bolshevik movement. In keeping with her unusual position during her time, she also kept diaries of her plans and ideas on moving towards a more &quot;modern&quot; society where socialism would help uproot that of capitalism and the oppression that different groups of gender and class had been facing. Kollontai was a great example of a woman who was indeed still oppressed by the times and was removed from her own ideologies and progress for the mere fact she was a woman in times where being so in a powerful position was frowned upon and &quot;great women&quot; were only allowed to be placed alongside &quot;great men&quot; in history. Kollontai&#x27;s most pertinent presence in feminist socialism was her stance on reproductive rights and her view on women being allowed the same luxuries that men have in finding love not only to be stable and supported, and to also be able to make their own money and be secure on their own two feet. She focused her attention on opening up society&#x27;s allowance of women&#x27;s liberation from a capitalist and bourgeois control and emphasizing women&#x27;s suffrage in the working-class.

A pioneering Marxist and feminist, Mary Inman of the Communist Party USA challenged the party&#x27;s orthodox position by arguing that the home is a center of production and housewives carry out productive labor. Her writings include &quot;In Woman&#x27;s Defense&quot; (1940) and &quot;Woman-Power&quot; (1942). Inman&#x27;s work was at first warmly received by several top Communist women leaders, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Ella Reeve Bloor, but the CPUSA leadership began an official attack on Inman&#x27;s work for purported ideological deviation in 1941. A series of articles written against Inman&#x27;s ideas appeared in the party&#x27;s literary monthly, &quot;The New Masses,&quot; and the polemic was extended with the publication of a pamphlet by A. Landy, &quot;Marxism and the Woman Question.&quot;

Radical Women, a major Marxist-feminist organization, bases its theory on Marx&#x27; and Engels&#x27; analysis that the enslavement of women was the first building block of an economic system based on private property. They contend that elimination of the capitalist profit-driven economy will remove the motivation for sexism, racism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression.

== Later theoretical works ==
=== Zillah R. Eisenstein ===
&quot;Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism&quot; was a collection of essays assembled and anthologized by Zillah R. Eisenstein in 1978.

Sociologist and academic Rhonda F. Levine cites Eisenstein&#x27;s work as a &quot;superb discussion of the socialist-feminist position&quot; in her anthology &quot;Enriching the Sociological Imagination: How Radical Sociology Changed the Discipline&quot;. Levine goes on to describe the book as &quot;one of the earliest statements of how a Marxist class analysis can combine with a feminist analysis of patriarchy to produce a theory of how gender and class intersect as systems of inequality&quot;.

Eisenstein defines the term &#x27;capitalist patriarchy&#x27; as &quot;descriptive of the &#x27;mutually reinforcing dialectical relationship between capitalist class structure and hierarchical sexual structuring.&quot;

She believes: &quot;The recognition of women as a sexual class lays the subversive quality of feminism for liberalism because liberalism is premised upon women&#x27;s exclusion from public life on this very class basis. The demand for real equality of women with men, if taken to its logical conclusion, would dislodge the patriarchal structure necessary to a liberal society.&quot;

=== Donna Haraway and &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; ===
In 1985, Donna Haraway published the essay &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century&quot; in &quot;Socialist Review&quot;. Although most of Haraway&#x27;s earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto came at a critical juncture at which feminists, in order to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the &quot;informatics of domination&quot;. Feminists must, she proclaims, unite behind &quot;an ironic dream of a common language for women in the integrated circuit&quot;. Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.

According to Haraway&#x27;s manifesto, &quot;there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category. There is not even such a state as &#x27;being&#x27; female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices&quot; (p. 155). A cyborg does not require a stable, essentialist identity, argues Haraway, and feminists should consider creating coalitions based on &quot;affinity&quot; instead of identity. To ground her argument, Haraway analyzes the phrase &quot;women of colour&quot;, suggesting it as one possible example of affinity politics. Using a term coined by theorist Chela Sandoval, Haraway writes that &quot;oppositional consciousness&quot; is comparable with a cyborg politics, because rather than identity it stresses how affinity comes as a result of &quot;otherness, difference, and specificity&quot; (p. 156).

Donna Haraway is the author of A Cyborg Manifesto and it describes a dystopian future in which cyborgs represent the ideal way society would treat people in fixing the way society separates people by gender, race and religion. In her extensive manifesto written in 1991, Haraway explains about a political myth as a &quot;cyborg&quot; who represents the ideal way someone would be treated in society. Haraway&#x27;s manifesto describes the cyborg as &quot;A cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women&#x27;s movements have constructed &#x27;women&#x27;s experience&#x27;, as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind&quot; Defined as a post-gender world, this cyborg represents the idea that there can by a dystopian future in which gender, religion and race are not dismissed but are not factors in how members of this society treat each other. This manifesto is consistently mentioning the idea of feminism and how feminists aren&#x27;t looking for more or less than men but to make the playing field equal. This also goes to the socialist feminism point that without a massive change in society the feminist won&#x27;t be able to get lasting change.

=== Autonomist feminism ===
Leopoldina Fortunati is the author of &quot;The Arcane of Reproduction: Housework, Prostitution, Labor and Capital&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;arcano della riproduzione: Casalinghe, prostitute, operai e capitale&quot;), a feminist critique of Marx. Fortunati is the author of several books, including &quot;The Arcane of Reproduction&quot; (Autonomedia, 1995) and &quot;I mostri nell&#x27;immaginario&quot; (Angeli, 1995), and is the editor of &quot;Gli Italiani al telefono&quot; (Angeli, 1995) and &quot;Telecomunicando in Europa&quot; (1998), and with J. Katz and R. Riccini &quot;Mediating the Human Body. Technology, Communication and Fashion&quot; (2003). Her influences include Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Antonio Negri, and Karl Marx.

Silvia Federici is an Italian scholar, teacher, and activist from the radical autonomist feminist Marxist tradition. Federici&#x27;s best known work, &quot;Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation&quot;, expands on the work of Leopoldina Fortunati. In it, she argues against Karl Marx&#x27;s claim that primitive accumulation is a necessary precursor for capitalism. Instead, she posits that primitive accumulation is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism itself—that capitalism, in order to perpetuate itself, requires a constant infusion of expropriated capital.

Federici connects this expropriation to women&#x27;s unpaid labour, both connected to reproduction and otherwise, which she frames as a historical precondition to the rise of a capitalist economy predicated upon wage labor. Related to this, she outlines the historical struggle for the commons and the struggle for communalism. Instead of seeing capitalism as a liberatory defeat of feudalism, Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.

She situates the institutionalization of rape and prostitution, as well as the heretic and witch-hunt trials, burnings, and torture at the center of a methodical subjugation of women and appropriation of their labor. This is tied into colonial expropriation and provides a framework for understanding the work of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other proxy institutions as engaging in a renewed cycle of primitive accumulation, by which everything held in common—from water, to seeds, to our genetic code—becomes privatized in what amounts to a new round of enclosures.

=== Material feminism ===
Material feminism highlights capitalism and patriarchy as central in understanding women&#x27;s oppression. The theory centers on social change rather than seeking transformation within the capitalist system. Jennifer Wicke, defines materialist feminism as &quot;a feminism that insists on examining the material conditions under which social arrangements, including those of gender hierarchy, develop [...]. [M]aterialist feminism avoids seeing this gender hierarchy as the effect of a singular [...] patriarchy and instead gauges the web of social and psychic relations that make up a material, historical moment&quot;. She states that &quot;materialist feminism argues that material conditions of all sorts play a vital role in the social production of gender and assays the different ways in which women collaborate and participate in these productions&quot;. Material feminism also considers how women and men of various races and ethnicities are kept in their lower economic status due to an imbalance of power that privileges those who already have privilege, thereby protecting the status quo.

The term material feminism was first used in 1975 by Christine Delphy. The current concept has its roots in socialist and Marxist feminism; Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham, editors of &quot;Materialist Feminism: A Reader in Class, Difference, and Women&#x27;s Lives&quot;, describe material feminism as the &quot;conjuncture of several discourses—historical materialism, Marxist and radical feminism, as well as postmodernist and psychoanalytic theories of meaning and subjectivity&quot;. The term materialist feminism emerged in the late 1970s and is associated with key thinkers, such as Rosemary Hennessy, Stevi Jackson and Christine Delphy. Rosemary Hennessy traces the history of Materialist Feminism in the work of British and French feminists who preferred the term materialist feminism to Marxist feminism. In their view, Marxism had to be altered to be able to explain the sexual division of labor. Marxism was inadequate to the task because of its class bias and focus on production. Feminism was also problematic due to its essentialist and idealist concept of woman. Material feminism then emerged as a positive substitute to both Marxism and feminism. Material feminism partly originated from the work of French feminists, particularly Christine Delphy. She argued that materialism is the only theory of history that views oppression as a basic reality of women&#x27;s lives. Delphy states that this is why women and all oppressed groups need materialism to investigate their situation. For Delphy, &quot;to start from oppression defines a materialist approach, oppression is a materialist concept&quot;. She states that the domestic mode of production was the site of patriarchal exploitation and the material basis of the oppression of women. Delphy further argued that marriage is a labor contract that gives men the right to exploit women. &quot;The Grand Domestic Revolution&quot; by Dolores Hayden is a reference. Hayden describes Material feminism at that time as reconceptualizing the relationship between the private household space and public space by presenting collective options to take the &quot;burden&quot; off women in regard to housework, cooking, and other traditional female domestic jobs.

=== Ecological feminism or Ecofeminism ===
In the 1970s, the impacts of post-World War II technological development led many women to organise against issues from the toxic pollution of neighbourhoods to nuclear weapons testing on indigenous lands. This grassroots activism emerging across every continent was both intersectional and cross-cultural in its struggle to protect the conditions for reproduction of Life on Earth. Known as ecofeminism, the political relevance of this movement continues to expand. Classic statements in its literature include Carolyn Merchant, US, &quot;The Death of Nature&quot;; Maria Mies, Germany, &quot;Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale&quot;; Vandana Shiva, India, &quot;Staying Alive: Women Ecology and Development&quot;; Ariel Salleh, Australia, &quot;Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx, and the postmodern&quot;. Ecofeminism involves a profound critique of Eurocentric epistemology, science, economics, and culture. It is increasingly prominent as a feminist response to the contemporary breakdown of the planetary ecosystem.

== Praxis ==
Socialist feminists believe that women&#x27;s liberation must be sought in conjunction with the social and economic justice of all people. They see the fight to end male supremacy as key to social justice, but not the only issue, rather one of many forms of oppression that are mutually reinforcing.

=== Women&#x27;s liberation in real socialism ===
In the forty years of socialism in East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), many feminist demands were implemented:
* While women in the West still fought for a liberal abortion law, abortion was allowed up to the 12th week since 1972 and contraception was available to anyone.
* While women in the West still had no access to the better paid male dominated professions, women in the GDR were encouraged to do so and promoted to further studies.
* Children were taken care of by kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, a service women in West Germany are still waiting for and the main obstacle to equal employment opportunities.
Nevertheless, feminists of West Berlin remained skeptical as they lived door to door with this real socialism. Cäcilia Rentmeister, who had personal contacts to friends and relatives in East Berlin analyzed in 1974 women&#x27;s situation in the GDR in an article.

=== Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union ===
The Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union (CWLU) was formed in 1969 after a founding conference in Palatine, Illinois. Naomi Weisstein, Vivian Rothstein, Heather Booth, and Ruth Surgal were among the founders. The main goal of the organization was to end gender inequality and sexism, which the CWLU defined as &quot;the systematic keeping down of women for the benefit of people in power&quot;. The purpose statement of the organization expressed that &quot;Changing women&#x27;s position in society isn&#x27;t going to be easy. It&#x27;s going to require changes in expectations, jobs, child care, and education. It&#x27;s going to change the distribution of power over the rest of us to all people sharing power and sharing in the decisions that affect our lives.&quot; The CWLU spent almost a decade organizing to challenge both sexism and class oppression. The group is best known for the 1972 pamphlet &quot;Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;, by the Hyde Park Chapter of the Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union. Nationally circulated, the publication is believed to be the first to use the term socialist feminism.

The CWLU was organized as an umbrella organization to unite a wide range of work groups and discussion groups. A representative from each work group went to monthly meetings of the Steering Committee to reach consensus on organizational policy and strategy. They addressed a myriad of issues including women&#x27;s health, reproductive rights, education, economic rights, visual arts and music, sports, lesbian liberation, and more.

=== Women&#x27;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell ===
Women&#x27;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.) was the name of many related but independent feminist groups formed in the United States during 1968 and 1969 and who were important in the development of socialist feminism. The name W.I.T.C.H. was also sometimes expanded as &quot;Women Inspired to Tell their Collective History&quot;, &quot;Women Interested in Toppling Consumer Holidays&quot;, and many other variations.

There was no centralized organization; each W.I.T.C.H. group was formed independently by women inspired by the ideas and example of previous actions. Their activism mainly took the form of &quot;zaps&quot;, a form of guerrilla theater mixing street theatre and protest, where they used attention-catching and humorous public actions to highlight political and economic complaints against companies and government agencies, frequently involving the use of witch costumes and the chanting of hexes. Witches often appeared as stock characters in feminist Left theatre, representing the misogynist crone stereotype.

On Halloween 1968, women from W.I.T.C.H. staged a &quot;hex&quot; of Wall Street at a branch of Chase Manhattan Bank, wearing rags and fright makeup; Robin Morgan stated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined sharply the next day. The DJIA did not decline sharply, and experienced a rise over the next several days and weeks. In December 1968 W.I.T.C.H targeted both the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Chicago Eight, saying that they conspired to treat only men as &quot;leaders&quot; of the antiwar movement. In 1969, W.I.T.C.H. held a protest at a &quot;Bridal Fair&quot; at Madison Square Garden. Members wore black veils. They handed out pamphlets titled &quot;Confront the Whoremakers&quot;, chanted &quot;Here come the slaves/Off to their graves&quot;, and had a mock &quot;unwedding&quot; ceremony. The protests also involved turning loose several white mice at the event, which Fair attendees began scooping up off the ground. The event resulted in negative media coverage for W.I.T.C.H., and some dissention among members over goals and tactics. In February 1970, the Washington coven (W.I.T.C.H. chapters were called &quot;covens&quot;) held a protest during a Senate hearing on population control. They interrupted Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough&#x27;s testimony by chanting and throwing pills at panel members and people in the audience galleries. Spin-off &quot;covens&quot; were founded in Chicago, Illinois, and Washington, D.C., and W.I.T.C.H. zaps continued until roughly the beginning of 1970. The &quot;zap&quot; protests used by W.I.T.C.H. may have helped inspire the zap action protest tactics adopted shortly afterwards by LGBT activists, and still in use.

=== Big Flame ===
Big Flame was &quot;a revolutionary socialist feminist organisation with a working-class orientation&quot; in the United Kingdom. Founded in Liverpool in 1970, the group initially grew rapidly, with branches appearing in some other cities. Its publications emphasised that &quot;a revolutionary party is necessary but Big Flame is not that party, nor is it the embryo of that party&quot;. The group was influenced by the Italian Lotta Continua group.

The group published a magazine, &quot;Big Flame&quot;; and a journal, &quot;Revolutionary Socialism&quot;. Members were active at the Ford plants at Halewood and Dagenham and devoted a great deal of time to self-analysis and considering their relationship with the larger Trotskyist groups. In time, they came to describe their politics as libertarian Marxist. In 1978, they joined the Socialist Unity electoral coalition, led by the Trotskyist International Marxist Group. In 1980, the anarchists of the Libertarian Communist Group joined Big Flame. The Revolutionary Marxist Current also joined at about this time. However, as more members of the group defected to the Labour Party, the journal ceased to appear in 1982, and the group was wound up in about 1984. Ex-members of the group were involved in the launch of the mass-market tabloid newspaper the &quot;News on Sunday&quot; in 1987, which folded the same year. The name of the group was taken from a television play, &quot;The Big Flame&quot; (1969), written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Play&quot; season. It dealt with a fictional strike and work-in at the Liverpool Docks.

<doc id="1178296" wikidata="Q707506" url="?curid=1178296" title="Choh Hao Li">
<text>Choh Hao Li (sometimes &quot;Cho Hao Li&quot;) (; April 21, 1913 – November 28, 1987) was a Chinese-born American biochemist who discovered in 1966 that human pituitary growth hormone (somatotropin) consists of a chain of 256 amino acids. In 1970, he succeeded in synthesizing this hormone, the largest protein molecule synthesized up to that time.

== Life and career ==
Li was born in Guangzhou and educated at the Nanjing University. In 1935, he immigrated to the US, where he took up postgraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and later joined the staff. He became professor in 1950. He served as Director of the Hormone Research Laboratory at Berkeley from 1950 to 1967 and at UCSF from 1967 until his retirement in 1983. In 1955, he was elected as Academician of Academia Sinica, Republic of China.

Li spent his entire academic career studying the pituitary-gland hormones. In collaboration with various co-workers, he isolated several protein hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex to increase its secretion of corticoids. In 1956, Li and his group showed that ACTH consists of 39 amino acids arranged in a specific order, and that the whole chain of the natural hormone is not necessary for its action. He isolated another pituitary hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and found that not only does this hormone produce some effects similar to those produced by ACTH, but also that part of the amino acid chain of MSH is the same as that of ACTH.

== Scientific achievements ==

In 1940, Li successfully purified the luteinizing hormone from sheep pituitary glands. The whole process included grinding thousands of glands, extracting the hormone, and then identifying its chemistry and biology at the molecular level. This was a breakthrough in biological studies.

Eight of the nine hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary were isolated and identified by Li and his research team. These nine hormones can be divided into three groups based on the similarity of their chemical properties and biological activities.

The first group includes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), and lipotropin.
* 1953 - Li was the first person to isolate and extract ACTH.
* 1964 - Li and his research team discovered and isolated lipotropin, and its structure was defined in 1965.
* 1975 - Li discovered β-endorphin when trying to find β-lipotropin in camel brain. The team isolated human β-endorphin in 1976 and synthesized it to study its biological activity after they defined the structure of β-endorphin.

The second group includes follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
* 1974 - Li and his team sequenced human LH and TSH.

The third group includes growth hormone and prolactin.
* 1944 - Li was the first person to isolate growth hormone from cow brains. The lack of function of cow growth hormone on human body motivated Dr. Li to find human growth hormone.
* 1956 - Li successfully isolated human and monkey growth hormone and demonstrated its efficacy to treat hypopituitary children.
* 1969 - Li discovered the complete primary structure of sheep prolactin.
* 1970 - Li synthesized proteins with human growth hormone activity.

== Awards ==
Li was an expert in diversified areas, including endocrinology, biochemistry, and peptide synthesis. He not only was a widely recognized leader in pituitary-secreted research for his contribution in hormone and growth factors, but also greatly advanced the field of protein chemistry. All of his research had direct impact on clinical applications, especially in growth and fertility. It is estimated that he had published more than 1,000 research papers and had collaborated with more than 300 people. In addition, he was also the recipient of a lot of honors (more than 25). The most significant ones are as follows:
* 1947 - the Ciba Award from the Endocrine Society
* 1951 - the Award of American Chemical Society
* 1955 - the Amory Prize of American Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1962 - the first Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research
* 1970 - the Scientific Achievement Award from American Medical Association
* 1971 - the National Award of the American Cancer Society
* 1972 - the Nicholas Andry Award from the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons
* 1977 - the Lewis Price of the American Philosophical Society
* 1979 - the William H. Nichols Medal of the American Chemical Society
* 1981 - the Koch Award of the Endocrine Society
* 1987 - the Alan E. Pierce Award (now R. Bruce Merrifield Award) from American Peptide Society

Li was elected to the following academies:
* 1958 - Academician of Academia Sinica
* 1963 - Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1973 - Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences
* 1978 - Foreign Member of Chilean Academy of Sciences
* 1984 - Foreign Member of Indian Institute of Science

== 10 Honorary Degrees ==

* 1978 - University of San Francisco 
* 1979 - Long Island University
* 1981 - University of Colorado
* 1982 - Medical College of Pennsylvania

== The Establishment of Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica ==
Despite his significant scientific achievements, Dr. Li was also dedicated to the initiation and development of protein research in Taiwan. In spring 1958, Dr. Li was invited by Dr. Shih Hu to lecture a three-week course regarding the newly developed technology in protein chemistry and his latest pituitary gland research at National Taiwan University with the support from China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. At that time, the academic community only knew that protein research was developing rapidly abroad and a scholar had already made extraordinary achievements, and so when Dr. Li introduced the first-hand knowledge, it really attracted and inspired domestic scientists. Dr. Li believed that the protein chemistry was the foundation of future biochemical and biological sciences research, so he decided to assist the establishment of domestic protein research institute. In order to cultivate talents in Taiwan, Dr. Li personally provided scholarships and selected and persuaded scholars who have settled in Taiwan to continue the research in his or other research institutes. With the support from Academia Sinica, National Science Council, Ministry of Education, and National Taiwan University, Institute of Biological Chemistry and Institute of Biochemical Sciences, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University were established in 1972. The two institutes were originally located in the National Taiwan University&#x27;s campus (Institutes of Biological Chemistry moved to Academia Sinica&#x27;s campus later) to integrate research institutes and the University. Dr. Li had always been serving the chief consultant to assist the collaboration of the two institutes and international networking. The achievement of the two institutes today are built on Dr. Li&#x27;s hard work. Dr. Li&#x27;s foresight also brought about the domestic development of biotechnology and genetic engineering.

<doc id="1178306" wikidata="Q4997551" url="?curid=1178306" title="Bundle of rights">
<text>The bundle of rights is a metaphor to explain the complexities of property ownership. Law school professors of introductory property law courses frequently use this conceptualization to describe &quot;full&quot; property ownership as a partition of various entitlements of different stakeholders.

The concept originated with Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld in 1913, although he himself never used the phrase &quot;bundle of rights&quot;. It was further developed and propagated to a broader audience in the form of the first Restatement of Property (published in five volumes between 1936 and 1944), because the Restatement&#x27;s first reporter, Harry Bigelow, was a fan of Hohfeld&#x27;s ideas.

The bundle of rights is commonly taught in first-year property courses in law schools in the United States to explain how property can simultaneously be &quot;owned&quot; by multiple parties. Before it was developed, the idea of property was seen in terms of dominion over a thing, as in the ability of the owner to place restrictions &quot;on others&quot; from interfering with the owner&#x27;s property. The &quot;bundle of rights,&quot; however, implies rules specifying, proscribing, or authorizing actions on the part of the owner.

Ownership of land is a much more complex proposition than simply acquiring all the rights to it. It is useful to imagine a bundle of rights that can be separated and reassembled. A &quot;bundle of sticks&quot; – in which each stick represents an individual right – is a common analogy made for the bundle of rights. Any property owner possesses a set of &quot;sticks&quot; related directly to the land.

For example, perfection of a mechanic&#x27;s lien takes some, but not all, rights out of the bundle held by the owner. Extinguishing that lien returns those rights or &quot;sticks&quot; to the bundle held by the owner. In the United States (and under common law) the fullest possible title to real estate is called &quot;fee simple absolute.&quot; Even the US federal government&#x27;s ownership of land is restricted in some ways by state property law.

==Basic property rights==

Traditionally, the bundle of rights concept encompassed five basic rights that may be held with respect to a parcel of real property

* Right of possession (&quot;ius possidendi&quot;): an entity is the legal owner of the property.
* Right of control: the owner of this right can prescribe what activity takes place on the property, such as the building of structures or operating a business. This right is often shared between the title owner and governments or organizations that have some form of administrative jurisdiction over the property, such as a city with Zoning regulations, or a homeowner association.
* Right of exclusion (&quot;ius prohibendi&quot;): the owner of this right is able to prohibit others from entering the property (that is, trespassing).
* Right of enjoyment (&quot;ius utendi fruendi&quot;): the owner of this right is able to use the property as they see fit, including activities such as inhabitation and resource extraction. These activities are generally constrained by laws by jurisdictional agencies. In many legal regimes, portions of this right may be held or owned separately; For example, while the title owner may have the general right, a lease holder has been granted a temporary subsidiary right to inhabit the property, while someone else may own the rights to any subsurface minerals or water.
* Right of disposition (&quot;ius disponendi&quot;): the owner of the property is able to transfer any of the rights they hold to another party, whether temporarily (as in a lease) or permanently (as through inheritance or sale).

==Variations on the concept==

Variations on the division between public and private property use can be found throughout the world. While the bundle of rights concept is strongly rooted in common law, there are comparable ideas in civil law systems and religious law systems. National, sub-national, and municipal laws strongly influence what title owners can do with their property in terms of physical development. Quasi-governmental bodies (such as utility companies) are also permitted to create easements across private property.

Historically the degrees of individual and community control over real property have varied greatly. The differences between capitalism, despotism, socialism, feudalism, and traditional societies often define different standards for land ownership. The bundle of rights concept looks much different when examined by different types of societies. For instance, a laissez-faire government would allow a much different bundle of rights than a communist government.

==Applications==

Community land trusts and land banking are examples of efforts to rearrange the bundle of rights. This is typically done by dividing the responsibilities of ownership and management from the rights to use the property. A typical community land trust strategy is to hold ownership over the land and sell the structural improvements (residential or other buildings) to low-income homebuyers. This allows people to buy a home at a price far below the market rate and to realize the benefits of their property value improving.

Real Estate Investment Trusts divide up the bundle of rights in order to allow commercial investments in real property. These legal structures are becoming more common throughout the developed world.

Squatting presents a non-economic way for people to transfer parts of the bundle of rights. Depending on the applicable laws, a squatter can acquire property rights by simply occupying vacant land for an extended period of time. Areas with high concentrations of squatters are sometimes thought of as &quot;informal settlements.&quot; Squatters face great instability due to their lack of title and governmental efforts at &quot;blight removal&quot;.

&quot;Squatting&quot; can result in &quot;adverse possession&quot;, that in common law, is the process by which title to another&#x27;s real property is acquired without compensation, by holding the property in a manner that conflicts with the true owner&#x27;s rights for a specified period of time. Circumstances of the adverse possession determine the type of title acquired by the adverse possessor, which may be fee simple title, mineral rights, or another interest in real property.

===Examples of component rights===

This table breaks down some of the various rights involved in real property ownership. Several of these rights can be transferred between different parties through sale or trade. Third parties can obtain the rights to access and profit from several of the &quot;public use&quot; rights without the consent of the title owner. This is often the case with resource extraction companies such as mines.
For example, a husband and wife can be owners (technically, title owners) of real property that is also encumbered by a mortgage and a mechanics lien. Their neighbor may have an easement for a utility line, and a license for entry and exit to a nearby plot of land. Airplanes have the right to fly through their airspace. Constitutionally, the state and federal governments always hold the right to condemnation, also called eminent domain, and the government at multiple levels retains various regulatory rights such as environmental regulation, zoning, and building code enforcement.

<text>The Aboriginal People&#x27;s Party was a political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that nominated 10 candidates in the 1982 elections for the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The aim of the party was to promote the interests of First Nations and Métis people in the province.

The party fared poorly: it collected only 1,156 votes, 0.22% of the provincial total. It won no seats in the legislature, and did not nominate candidates in any subsequent election.

<doc id="1178313" wikidata="Q1075728" url="?curid=1178313" title="Li Choh-ming">
<text>Li Choh-ming (李卓敏, 1912 – 1991) was a Chinese-born American economist and educator. He was the founding Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1963. He compiled The Li Chinese Dictionary (Cantonese-Mandarin). He was an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nankai University in Tianjin during his academic career.
==Career==

Born in Canton, China in 1912 to Li Kanchi and Li Mewshing, Li Choh-Ming was the third child and the eldest son in a family of 11 children. He graduated from Puiying High School in Canton before heading off to the U.S. at the University of California, Berkeley where he earned his B.S. in commerce (1932), M.A. (1933) and Ph.D. in economics (1936). Eventually, three of his brothers Choh-Hao, Choh-Hsien, Choh-Luh and a sister, Djoh-i, came from China to study various sciences at U.C. Berkeley.
Li returned to China to teach economics at Nankai University in Tianjin in 1937. From 1938-1943, Li taught at the National Southwest Associated University (Lianda) when the top three universities in China (Tsinghua, Peking, Nankai) consolidated into one, moving to Kunming and Chongqing as the Sino-Japanese war broke. Li was among the key economists to bring Western economic ideas into China, both in teaching and serving as China&#x27;s representative at various international missions. In 1945-47 Li was named Deputy Director-General of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA)in Shanghai, to work with the United Nations (UNRRA) in managing the postwar relief and recovery effort in China. As the war ended, Li became China&#x27;s permanent delegate to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1948-49 and Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Rehabilitation Affairs (BOTRA) 1949-50 to help reconstruct China with long-term economic development.

In 1951 Li immigrated to the U.S. where he began as a lecturer in economics, becoming professor of business administration in 1958, and Chairman of the Center for Chinese Studies (1961) at his alma mater, the University of California-Berkeley. Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, Li was able to bring his wife Sylvia and family of 2 sons, Winston and Tony, and a daughter Jeannie, to the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1955.

==Writing==

His scholarly contributions focused on the economic system of Communist China and its performance. His books, the &quot;Economic Development of Communist China&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Statistical System of Communist China (1962)&quot; were seminal works before China sealed itself off from outsiders. Li&#x27;s continuous study of social and economic problems of China helped establish UC-Berkeley as a center for scholarly research on China. His expertise in international trade and economics helped establish international business in the School of Business Administration curricula. 
In 1963 the Government of Hong Kong appointed Li Choh-Ming to head the Chinese University of Hong Kong. With government backing of the U.K. and the U.S., the Board of Regents of the University of California granted him an unprecedented 10-year leave of absence to form and establish the new university. As head, Li was named Vice-Chancellor of the university (in the British tradition, the Governor of Hong Kong was the Chancellor of all Hong Kong colleges and universities). The new university was founded with the motto “to combine tradition and modernity and to bring together China and the West” by adding the Chinese dimension or data into every academic discipline. From the beginning, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin were the languages of instruction. Student and faculty exchanges with the U.S., the U.K., and other countries were established. He wrote and oversaw The CUHK publications on the formation and development of the university: &quot;The First Six Years 1963-69&quot; (1971), &quot;The Emerging University&quot; (1975), and &quot;A New Era Begins&quot; (1979). Li retired from The CUHK in 1978. Li was Professor Emeritus at Berkeley in 1973. Throughout his tenure at The CUHK, Li personally compiled and developed a pictophonetic Cantonese-Mandarin dictionary. He called his new system of codifying Chinese characters the Fan System. &quot;The Li Chinese Dictionary&quot; (李氏中文字典, Li shi zhong wen zi dian) was published and distributed in the West and in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1981.
Li Choh-Ming received many honors from around the world. Among them were honorary knighthoods, the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1973. At The Chinese University of Hong Kong, the medical building is named after him and a life size statue of him sits at the Institute of Chinese Studies. From the University of California, he received the Elise and Walter A. Haas International Award (1974) and the Clark Kerr Award (1979).

<doc id="1178325" wikidata="Q625168" url="?curid=1178325" title="KBO League">
<text>The KBO League () is the highest level league of baseball in South Korea, contested by ten teams. The KBO League was founded with six franchises in 1982 and is the most popular sports league in South Korea. The Kia Tigers are the most successful team, having won 12 of the 43 championships.

In comparison with American Major League Baseball, ESPN reports that the KBO level of play &quot;appears to be somewhere between Double-A and Triple-A, on average, though the best players are more likely to be MLB-quality than your typical Double-A league.&quot; Historically, the KBO is known for its vocal and exuberant fan base, as well as the widespread practice of bat flips (&quot;ppa-dun&quot; (), a portmanteau of the &quot;first syllables of the words for &#x27;bat&#x27; and &#x27;throw&#x27;&quot;) by hitters after striking what they think will be a home run. In the KBO, the bat flipping tradition dates to the 1990s.

==League structure==
===Regular season===
Since the 2015 season, each team plays 144 games in the regular season, an increase from 128 games, along with the introduction of the KT Wiz to the league. Each team plays every other team 16 times. In general, Korean teams play six games a week, with every Monday off.

===KBO All-Star Game===
In mid-July of every season, the best players participate in the KBO All-Star Game. The franchises participating are divided into two sets of teams: &quot;Dream All-Stars&quot; (Doosan, KT, Lotte, Samsung, and SSG) and &quot;Nanum All-Stars&quot; (Kia, Hanwha, LG, NC and Kiwoom).

===Post-season===
The KBO League&#x27;s season culminates in its championship series, known as the KBO Korean Series. Currently, the top five teams qualify for the post-season based on win–loss records. The lowest-qualifying teams face off in a step-ladder playoff system, where each winner then faces the next-highest team, culminating in the Korean Series against the top-ranked team.

* &quot;KBO Wild Card Game&quot;: fifth-place team vs. fourth-place team
::&quot;Fourth-place team starts the series with a 1–0 lead and advances with one win or a tie, while the fifth-place team must win twice to advance.&quot;
* &quot;KBO Semi-playoffs&quot;: KBO Wild Card Game winner vs. third-place team
::&quot;Best of five series.&quot;
* &quot;KBO Playoffs&quot;: KBO Semi-playoffs winner vs. second-place team
::&quot;Best of five series.&quot;
* &quot;KBO Korean Series&quot;: KBO Playoffs winner vs. first-place team
::&quot;Best of seven series.&quot;

Any playoff games ending in an official tie are replayed, thereby raising the possibility of a close series containing more than the scheduled five or seven games.

==Rules==
The KBO League rules are essentially those of the Major League Baseball (MLB). The designated hitter rule is universal in KBO.

Traditionally, South Korean professional baseball games have a maximum number of extra innings before a game is declared an official tie. The KBO abolished this limit for the 2008 season, but it was reinstated in 2009, with a 12-inning limit imposed during the regular season, and a 15-inning limit for playoff games.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The first game was played on March 27, 1982, between the Samsung Lions and the MBC Chungyong at Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium, Seoul. Then-president Chun Doo-hwan threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

The 1982 charter teams of its first season were:
* Haitai Tigers, based in Gwangju
* Lotte Giants, based in Busan
* MBC Chungyong, based in Seoul
* OB Bears, based in Daejeon
* Sammi Superstars, based in Incheon
* Samsung Lions, based in Daegu

The first Korean Series featured the Bears versus the Lions, with OB winning the championship 4-games-to-1, with a tie.

=== The 1980s ===
The Haitai Tigers dominated the 1980s, winning the Korean Series five times — in 1983, 1986, and 1987 through 1989. They were led by pitcher Sun Dong-yol and infielders Kim Seong-han and Han Dae-hwa. Other KBO stars whose careers took off in the 1980s were sluggers Chang Jong-hoon and Lee Man-soo.

From 1982 to 1988, the regular season was divided into two (a spring season and a fall season), with a first-half pennant winner and a latter-half pennant winner. The two pennant winners then played each other for the Korean Series championship. The 1982 campaign featured an 80-game (in total) season, which expanded to 100 games from 1983 to 1984. Rosters for each team were small (sometimes as few as 14 players), and many players in the league both pitched and batted. Bang Soo-won of the Haitai Tigers pitched the first no-hitter in Korean professional baseball history, in 1984 against the Sammi Superstars.

Mid-season 1985, the Sammi Superstars were sold and became known as the Chungbo Pintos, and the full season expanded to 110 games. Because the Samsung Lions won both half-season pennants (with a still single-season record .706 winning percentage), the Lions won the title outright so no Korean Series was played that year.

Because of the lack of a postseason in 1985, the next year saw some major changes, with the adoption of a playoff system, in which the top two teams from each half-season played for the right to get to the Korean Series. 1986 also saw the OB Bears moving from Daejeon to share Jamsil Baseball Stadium with MBC Chungyong in Seoul. A new franchise, the Binggrae Eagles, joined the league, replacing the vacancy in Daejeon made by OB&#x27;s move, and expanding the league to seven teams. From 1986 to 1988, the regular season shrank to a total of 108 games.

1988 saw the Cheongbo Pintos change ownership again, becoming the Pacific Dolphins. In 1989 the KBO eliminated the two half-season pennants, moving to a single season of 120 games.

=== The 1990s ===
In the 1990s the Tigers were again dominant, winning the championship four times in the decade — 1991, 1993, 1996, and 1997. The Tigers were led by hitting-machine Lee Jong-beom and slugger Lee Ho-joon. Other KBO players who starred in the 1990s were Eagles&#x27; pitcher Song Jin-woo, who eventually became the all-time KBO leader in wins, strikeouts, and innings pitched; slugging catcher Park Kyung-oan, the first catcher in KBO history to hit 300 home runs; and stolen base king Jeon Jun-ho. But probably the most notable hitters to emerge from the 1990s were the Lions&#x27; Lee Seung-yuop and Yang Joon-hyuk, who between them now hold most of the KBO&#x27;s career offensive records.

In 1990, MBC Chungyong became the LG Twins and an eighth franchise was added, the Ssangbangwool Raiders, who represented the North Jeolla Province region.

From 1991 to 1998, the season increased to 126 games. The Lotte Giants won the Korean Series championship in 1992; the team has not won it since. There was little other change during this period except for a few major sponsors: in 1993 the Binggrae Eagles became the Hanwha Eagles, in 1996 the Pacific Dolphins became the Hyundai Unicorns, and in 1999 the OB Bears became the Doosan Bears.

The 1998 Korean Series was won by the Hyundai Unicorns for the franchise&#x27;s first championship in 16 years of existence. (The team would go on to win the championship in 2000, 2003, and 2004.)

In 1999 the season was expanded to 132 games, and the KBO separated into two divisions — the Dream League and the Magic League. The 1999 Dream League consisted of the Doosan Bears, the Lotte Giants, the Haitai Tigers, and the Hyundai Unicorns; the 1999 Magic League consisted of the Hanwha Eagles, the LG Twins, the Samsung Lions, and the Ssangbangwool Raiders. That year the Eagles — in their 14th season — won their franchise&#x27;s first (and only) Korean Series championship, after 14 years in the KBO.

=== The 2000s ===
Bigger changes were made in 2000 when the Hyundai Unicorns moved from Incheon to Suwon, and a new franchise, the SK Wyverns, took their place in Incheon. The Ssangbangwool Raiders became defunct. The league&#x27;s two-division structure slightly shifted as well, with SK taking Ssangbangwool&#x27;s place in the Magic Division, and Lotte and Samsung switching divisions. Thus, the 2000 Dream League was composed of Doosan, Haitai, Hyundai, and Samsung; while the 2000 Magic League was composed of Hanwha, LG, Lotte, and SK.

Parity ruled the 2000s, with the Unicorns and Lions each winning three titles, and the upstart Wyverns winning two. The hard-luck Doosan Bears appeared in the Korean Series five times in the decade but only won it once, in 2001. Stars who emerged in the 2000s include all-time KBO hit king Park Yong-taik, the Giants&#x27; first-baseman Dae-ho Lee, and the Eagles&#x27; first-baseman Kim Tae-kyun. Other notable players from the era include slugging third-basemen Lee Bum-ho and Choi Jeong, the Bears&#x27; designated hitter Hong Sung-heon, and the Twins&#x27; long-time outfielder Lee Byung-kyu.

In 2001, the KBO returned to a single-division format. The Haitai Tigers became the Kia Tigers. From 2000 to 2012, the length of the regular season fluctuated between 126 and 133 games.

Despite its string of championships in the early 2000s, the Hyundai Unicorns franchise was disbanded in 2008. It was re-founded as the Woori Heroes and moved to Mok-dong in Seoul. In 2010, the team&#x27;s naming rights were sold to Nexen Tire and the team was renamed the Nexen Heroes until the end of the 2018 season, when its naming rights were sold to Kiwoom Securities.

=== The 2010s ===
The Samsung Lions were a powerful team in the 2010s, winning the championship four times during six straight appearances in the Korean Series (from 2010 to 2015). The Doosan Bears were also a powerhouse, appearing in the Korean Series six times in the decade (including five straight appearances from 2015 to 2019), winning it three times.

Expansion resumed in the 2010s, with the addition of the NC Dinos, located in Changwon, which joined the league in 2013. It is the first team located in Changwon, the city having previously been the second home of the nearby Lotte Giants. The KBO played 128-game seasons in 2013–2014.

In 2015, the KT Wiz became the league&#x27;s tenth franchise. They play their home games in Suwon, which had not had a team since the Hyundai Unicorns&#x27; disbandment. Since 2015 the KBO has played a 144-game season each year, and has added a fifth team to the playoffs, with the introduction of the Wild Card game. In 2015 the league also increased the active roster size of each team, from 26 to 27 (of those, 25 may play in any one game).

After a number of seasons of inflated offensive production, the KBO introduced a new &quot;dejuiced&quot; baseball before the 2019 season. The results showed in a significant decrease in runs per game and home runs per game.

=== The 2020s ===
The 2020 season was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but finally started play in May 2020, with no fans in attendance. In response to the lack of live sports programming due to the pandemic, ESPN and the KBO League entered into an agreement to broadcast six games weekly for the 2020 season. The Opening Day game between the NC Dinos and Samsung Lions was broadcast as the first game under the agreement that night. Karl Ravech, Jason Benetti, Boog Sciambi, Eduardo Perez, and Jessica Mendoza, along with various guests, broadcast the game remotely via Internet from their homes. The deal was for the 2020 season only and was not renewed for 2021.

== Expatriate baseball players in the KBO ==
As with Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the KBO league places a cap on the number of foreign players allowed on club rosters. The foreign player limit is set at three (no more than two of them being pitchers), increased from two players from 2014. Foreign players can only sign single-season contracts, and they are restricted by a salary cap. Since 2019, the total compensation for a foreign player has been capped at $1 million. The foreign hitters on each team are expected to provide power in the middle of the order, while the foreign pitchers are expected to anchor the starting rotation. As with foreign players in the NPB, many of the most celebrated foreign players came to Korea after not finding success in the Major Leagues.

The KBO first began allowing foreign players in 1998, when each team was allowed to sign up to two imports. Traditionally, teams chose one hitter and one pitcher, although there were exceptions. (In 2001 and 2002, KBO teams were allowed three foreign-born players, but only two of them could be on the field at the same time.) By 2012, teams were using all their foreign-player allotments on pitchers, and there were no more foreign hitters in the KBO. After this happened again in 2013, the following season the KBO League raised the foreign-player limit to three for each team, but mandated that at least one foreign player had to be a hitter (again, with only two such players on the field at a time).

American Tyrone Woods was the first notable import. Debuting with the Doosan Bears in 1998, Woods was the first foreign player to hit a home run (as well as the first to be ejected from a game by an umpire). In his first year Woods set a then-KBO record with 42 homers and won the MVP award (becoming the first foreign player to win the award). In five years in Korea, Woods hit 174 homers, drove in 510 runs, and batted .294. (He later found additional success in Nippon Professional Baseball.) Woods left Korea with the longest career of any foreign player in KBO history, a record later eclipsed by hitter Jay Davis and pitcher Dustin Nippert. Davis played seven seasons for Hanwha (1999–2002, 2004–2006), compiling a .313 batting average, 167 home runs, and 591 RBI during that span.

Foreign pitchers with extended careers in the KBO include Dustin Nippert, who compiled a win–loss record of 102–51 and 1,082 strikeouts in eight seasons (a foreign player record); and Danny Rios, who in six seasons was 90–59 with 807 strikeouts and an ERA of 3.01, which is the lowest career ERA of any foreign pitcher in the KBO. Josh Lindblom pitched in the KBO for five seasons, compiling a 63–34 record and 750 strikeouts. Rios was given the 2008 KBO League Most Valuable Player Award, Nippert was KBO MVP in 2016, and Lindblom won the award in 2019.

American Jerry Royster was the first-ever non-Korean to take the helm of one of South Korea&#x27;s professional baseball clubs when he was signed as manager of the Lotte Giants in 2007. (Royster served as the Giants&#x27; manager through the 2010 season.)

Over the league&#x27;s history, more than 200 Americans have played in the KBO; other countries which have produced many current and former KBO players include the Dominican Republic (with more than 80 players), and Venezuela (with more than 20 players).

== KBO players in Japan and the U.S. ==

Several KBO players have had successful careers in Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Baek In-chun played professionally in Japan from 1963 to 1981, compiling 209 home runs, 776 RBI, and 1,831 hits in the NPB. (He returned to Korea for his final three seasons as a player.) Lee Seung-yuop, who holds the KBO records for career home runs, runs scored, RBIs, total bases, slugging percentage and OPS, also played eight seasons in the NPB, accumulating an additional 159 home runs and 439 RBI. Other KBO hitters who had some success in the NPB include Kim Tae-kyun and Dae-ho Lee. Korean pitchers who have had an impact in the NPB include Sun Dong-yol, Lim Chang-yong, and Seung-hwan Oh (who led the NPB in saves in both 2014 and 2015).

Several Korean players have also successfully transitioned from the KBO to American Major League Baseball, starting in 1994 with pitcher Chan Ho Park. (Prior to Park, the South Korea-born Mexican pitcher Ernesto Carlos [born as Lee Won-Kuk] was signed to an American minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants&#x27; organization in 1968 after having found success in the NPB. Similarly, pitcher Park Chul-soon signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers organization in 1980. Neither Ernesto Carlos nor Park Chul-soon, however, made it to the Major Leagues.) Other Korean born players who have had lengthy MLB careers include outfielder Shin-Soo Choo and pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. In 2013, Hanwha Eagles ace Hyun-jin Ryu became the first player from the KBO to join an MLB team through the posting system. Altogether, 28 South Korean players have made it to the MLB as of 2024.

== Teams ==



== Broadcasters ==
In South Korea, most of the games are aired free-to-air on MBC, SBS and KBS2, and at pay television on KBS N Sports, MBC Sports+, SBS Sports and SPOTV1/2.

Between 2021 and 2023, SPOTV broadcast selected games in the ASEAN region.

In 2024, streaming platform TVING became the exclusive home of the KBO League, marking the end of the league&#x27;s free online broadcast era in South Korea. In June that same year, free streaming service SOOP acquired the rights to broadcast all KBO games outside of South Korea through the 2026 season.

== Ballparks ==


In addition to these ballparks, the Lotte Giants play some games at Ulsan Munsu Baseball Stadium, the Samsung Lions at Pohang Baseball Stadium and the Hanwha Eagles at Cheongju Baseball Stadium.

==Attendance figures==
In the 2016 season, a new national record was set with more than 8 million spectators. There was a big increase of 1 million compared to the previous season.

The record was broken again in the 2017 season with over 8.4 million fans at the regular season games. The Bears, Twins, Giants and Tigers all attracted over 1 million fans, and the average game attendance was above 11,600 fans. This increase in popularity has been accompanied by the building of larger and more modern ballparks to further enhance the fan experience and their expenditures during games, such as Gwangju-Kia Champions Field (2014), Gocheok Sky Dome (2016), Daegu Samsung Lions Park (2016), and Changwon NC Park (2019).

The KBO League has shown significant growth among female audiences in recent years; data from the early 2024 season showed that approximately 54% of ticket holders were female, with the majority being in their 20s. Survey released after the 2024 season not only confirmed the early season data, but also showed that women in their 30s also had a strong interest in the league and were more interested in financially supporting their favorite teams than their male counterparts.

<doc id="1178330" wikidata="Q5134216" url="?curid=1178330" title="Clinton River (Michigan)">
<text>The Clinton River is a river in southeastern Michigan in the United States. It is named in honor of DeWitt Clinton, who was governor of New York from 1817 to 1823.

The main branch of the river rises from wetlands and coldwater tributaries from within Independence, Brandon and Springfield townships in Oakland County. A series of dams create a number of small lakes west of Pontiac, the last of which is Crystal Lake. The river is piped under downtown Pontiac, re-emerging to the east of downtown. The north branch and the middle branch rise in northern Macomb County and join the main branch in Clinton Township (which was named after the river in 1824). The main branch flows from its headwaters to Lake St. Clair in Harrison Township.

The Clinton River watershed drains , including most of Macomb County, a large portion of Oakland County, as well as small portions of Lapeer and St. Clair counties. More than 1.4 million people in over 60 municipalities live in the watershed. For the most part, only the waters located downstream of the city of Mount Clemens are navigable by water vessels.

Under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972, along with 42 other areas, the lower segment of the river was designated as an Area of Concern, based on the heavy presence of pollutant contamination. In 1995, the designation was expanded to include the entire watershed of the river and the lower nearshore of Lake St. Clair.

The Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal was a failed attempt to build a waterway connecting Lake St. Clair with Lake Michigan. It was originally planned to stretch 216 miles, but was abandoned after only 13 miles had been completed.

The French explorers of the late 17th century knew the river as the &quot;Nottawasippee&quot;, an Ojibwe term that means &quot;like rattlesnakes.&quot; This was also the name given to the Huron people by the region&#x27;s Anishinaabe (Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi) inhabitants.

British fur traders referred to it as the Huron River of St. Clair. It was referred to as &quot;the River Huron&quot; in the 1784 home eulogy of the area&#x27;s first American settler, William Tucker, who built his home along the river about upstream from its mouth.

It received its current name on July 17, 1824. The Michigan Territorial Council made the change in order to end the confusion between this river and the Huron River of Lake Erie, which also rises in Oakland County&#x27;s Springfield Township.

The Huron-Clinton Metroparks system preserves land in the watershed as public parks; Wolcott Mill Metropark is on the north branch of the river.

<doc id="1178349" wikidata="Q3843132" url="?curid=1178349" title="Maggie's">
<text>Maggie&#x27;s centres are a network of drop-in centres across the United Kingdom and abroad that aim to help anyone who has been affected by cancer. They are intended as welcoming and caring environments that provide support, information and practical advice to people dealing with a cancer diagnosis. They also offer wellbeing sessions and workshops to complement conventional cancer therapy.

The Maggie&#x27;s centres in the United Kingdom are located near, but are detached from, existing NHS hospitals.

==History==
Maggie&#x27;s was founded by and named after the late Maggie Keswick Jencks, who died of cancer in 1995. Like her husband, architectural writer and critic Charles Jencks, she believed in the ability of buildings to uplift people. 

In 2016, Maggie&#x27;s merged with Cancerkin, a charity in the United Kingdom which offers support to breast cancer patients. Cancerkin is based at the Royal Free Hospital in North London and was founded in 1987.

The Scottish registered charity (registration number SC024414) that promotes, builds and runs the centres is formally named the Maggie Keswick Jencks Cancer Caring Trust, but refers to itself simply as Maggie&#x27;s.

The buildings that house the centres have been designed by leading architects, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid and Richard Rogers. &quot;Christian Voice&quot; has been criticised for its role in causing Maggie&#x27;s centres to decline a four-figure donation from the proceeds of a special performance of &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;. The charity had been due to receive £10 per ticket for an afternoon gala in 2005 but declined the donation after &quot;Christian Voice&quot; had threatened to picket their centres.

Patrons of the charity include Frank Gehry, Janet Ellis, Norman Foster, Kirsty Wark, and Sarah Brown, wife of former British prime minister Gordon Brown. The charity&#x27;s chief executive is Dame Laura Lee, who was founder Maggie&#x27;s cancer nurse. The president of the charity is Queen Camilla.

==Locations==

=== Scotland ===

==== Edinburgh ====
The first Maggie&#x27;s centre opened in Edinburgh in 1996, and is located within the Western General Hospital on Crewe Road. The centre is housed in a converted stable block. The conversion, designed by Richard Murphy, was nominated for the 1997 Stirling Prize. The centre was extended, again by Murphy, in 1999.

==== Glasgow ====
Glasgow&#x27;s first Maggie&#x27;s centre opened in 2002 and was located at the Western Infirmary on Dumbarton Road, near the Kelvingrove Museum. The centre was housed in a former gatehouse lodge of the University of Glasgow, renovated and altered by Page\Park Architects. Charles Jencks designed the landscaping around the site, and contributed a DNA sculpture for the garden. In 2011, a new facility opened at Gartnavel, designed by OMA and led by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and Ellen van Loon.

==== Dundee ====

Frank Gehry&#x27;s first building in the United Kingdom was the Maggie&#x27;s centre at Dundee. The centre opened in September 2003 at Ninewells Hospital. Gehry&#x27;s design was named &quot;Building of the Year&quot; by the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland, and was also nominated for the 2004 RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture.

==== Highlands ====
The Maggie&#x27;s centre in Inverness, Highland, is at Raigmore Hospital, and was designed by David Page of Page\Park Architects. Landscape design and sculptures were again the work of Charles Jencks. The building opened in 2005, and won the 2006 RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture.

==== Fife ====
The Maggie&#x27;s centre in Kirkcaldy, Fife, opened in November 2006 at the Victoria Hospital. The building was designed by Zaha Hadid, and is her first built work in the UK. In the building there is emphasis placed on the transition between the natural and the man-made, and on the period between the hospital and home; the transition after having undergone treatment. There was an emphasis on clear and translucent glass, with powerfully sculptural cantilevers. The entrance facade is almost entirely made from glass. On the north side, the roof extension protects the entrance, while to the south, it provides shade. This can be seen as a fusion between form and function. Much thought has gone into the layout of the building, with the kitchen as the centre of the building and an informal atmosphere.
==== Aberdeen ====
Maggie&#x27;s Aberdeen was designed by Norwegian architects Snøhetta at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen and opened in 2013.

==== Lanarkshire ====
Maggie&#x27;s Lanarkshire opened in 2014 at Monklands Hospital, Airdrie and was designed by Reiach and Hall Architects of Edinburgh.

In May 2009 the centre won a RIBA award for architectural excellence and was named as London Project of the Year. In October 2009 Richard Rogers and his team at Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners were awarded the Stirling Prize for the building, and donated the £20,000 prize money to the cancer care centre.

==== Nottingham ====

Completed in 2011 Piers Gough&#x27;s building for Nottingham&#x27;s Maggies offers a &quot;light, peaceful and non-institutional design (to) be a sanctuary for all those who walk through the door. Sheltered by trees, the centre (is) a homely, comfortable space next to the busy hospital, where anyone affected by cancer can come to relax. The centre is a safe space where visitors can engage with nature while being sheltered from the elements. From the outside the playful appearance entice(s) people to take a look through the door; once they do the harmony of light and space will create a uniquely welcoming environment.&quot; The interior was designed by fashion designer Paul Smith, who grew up in Nottingham.

<text>Hwang Sun-wŏn (; March 26, 1915 – September 14, 2000) was a Korean short story writer, novelist, and poet.

==Life==
Hwang was born while Korea was under Japanese colonial rule in Taedong County, South Pyongan, in modern-day North Korea. Hwang Sunwon made his literary debut as a middle school student with the publication in 1931 of his poems “My Dream” (Naui kkum) and “Fear Not, My Son” (Adeura museowo malla) in Eastern Light (Donggwang). Hwang graduated from Waseda University in Japan with a degree in English. 
During his time at Waseda he founded a theater group called Tokyo Students’ Group for the Arts (Donggyeong haksaeng yesuljwa), along with fellow students Lee Haerang and Kim Dongwon. In November 1934, Hwang Sunwon published his first poetry collection, Wayward Songs (Bangga). Following the division of Korea he lived in the South, becoming a professor at Kyunghee University.

==Work==
Hwang published his first story in 1937 and continued writing through the 1980s; during his long literary career, Hwang Sunwon observed firsthand the suffering of ordinary Koreans under many different forms of oppression: colonialism, ideological strife, Korean War, industrialization, military dictatorships. What he sought to capture was the resilience of the Korean spirit even in times of adversity, rather than the adversity itself, and the discovery of love and goodwill in the most unlikely of circumstances.

Although he wrote many volumes of poetry and eight novels, Hwang achieved his greatest acclaim as the author of short fiction, which was regarded as the premiere literary genre through most of the twentieth century in Korea and Hwang was noted, particularly early in his career, for refusing to write in Japanese. (Yom Sang-seop was another example of this stance). Hwang is the author of some of the best-known stories in the modern Korean literary canon, including “Stars” (1940), “Old Man Hwang” (1942), “The Old Potter” (1944), “Cloudburst” (1952), “Cranes” (1953) and “Rain Shower”(1959).

In “Cranes” (Hak), for example, two childhood friends now on opposite sides of the ideological divide, find a way to rediscover their love for each other, and “The Shower” (Sonagi) highlights the pathos and beauty of love between two children. Children, in fact, often appear in Hwang Sunwon’s short stories as vessels of purity. “The Swamp” (Neup) and “The Stars” also manifest concern with the ephemerality of childhood.

Hwang began writing novels in the 1950s, his most successful being &quot;Trees on a Slope&quot; (1960), which depicts the lives of three soldiers during the Korean War. &quot;Sunlight, Moonlight&quot; (1962–65) depicts the lives of members of the former untouchable class in urban Seoul. &quot;The Moving Castle&quot; (1968–72) depicts the complex and problematic synthesis of Western and indigenous cultures in rapidly modernizing Korea. It is also one of the few depictions in fiction of gender roles in Korean shamanism.

On 26 March 2015, Google celebrated Hwang&#x27;s 100th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>CSS &quot;Richmond&quot; was the name ship of her class of six casemate ironclads built for the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. Completed during 1862 the ship was assigned to the James River Squadron where she mostly supported Confederate forces near Richmond, Virginia. She was burned in April 1865 to prevent her capture by Union forces.

==Background and description==
The ship was built to a design by the Chief Naval Constructor, John L. Porter, based on his earlier work on the ironclad , retaining the traditional curving ship-type hull, but with flat ends to the casemate. As usual for Confederate ships, dimensions vary slightly between sources. The plan showed an overall length of and a length between perpendiculars of with a maximum beam of , a moulded beam of and a depth of hold of about . The consensus figure for the ship&#x27;s draft is She was fitted with a pilothouse at the forward end of the casemate roof.

The propulsion systems of the &quot;Richmond&quot;-class ironclads were different for each of the ships, often depending on what could be sourced locally. &quot;Richmond&quot;″s single-cylinder, 80-horsepower direct-acting steam engine had been stored in the Gosport Navy Yard when the brig was converted to a lightship in 1859. Seized when the Confederates captured the Navy Yard, the engine used steam provided by a pair of horizontal fire-tube boilers built by either the Tredegar Iron Works or the Shockoe Foundry in Richmond to drive a three-bladed, propeller. The boilers were tall, long, and wide. &quot;Richmond&quot; had a speed of and a crew of 150. She also carried about 20 to 25 Confederate States Marines in case of a battle that required naval boarding.

&quot;Richmond&quot; was armed with four Brooke rifles, one of which was two banded (reinforced at the breech) and the others were single-banded guns. Two of the guns were on pivot mounts at the bow and stern and the others were positioned on each broadside. The ship was also equipped with a spar torpedo at her bow. Other sources concur with the total of four guns, but state that they consisted of one 7-inch Brooke rifle in the bow, two Brooke rifles on the broadsides, and a muzzle-loading smoothbore gun on a pivot mounting in the stern. Naval historian Raimondo Luraghi states that the ship was armed with four 7-inch Brooke rifles and two smoothbores, while official historian Paul Marcello simply notes that the ship was equipped with four rifled guns and two smoothbore shell guns.

Sources agree that &quot;Richmond&quot;″s casemate was protected by of wrought-iron armor in two layers of plates. The casemate structure consisted of , or of oak and yellow pine. The roof of the casemate was covered by iron plates, backed by of wood. One layer of two-inch plates protected the fore and aft main decks and extended below the waterline for several feet. A 10-inch iron casting supposedly defended the pilothouse.

==Construction and career==
Named for the capitol of the Confederacy, &quot;Richmond&quot; was begun at Gosport Navy Yard in March 1862, launched on May 6 and towed up to her namesake that very night to escape Federal forces threatening the yard and the lower James River. She was sometimes referred to as &quot;Virginia II&quot;, &quot;Virginia No. 2&quot; or &quot;Young Virginia&quot; in the South and as &quot;Merrimack No. 2&quot;, &quot;New Merrimack&quot; or &quot;Young Merrimack&quot; by Union writers, months before the actual was ever laid down. The ironclad was thus finished at Richmond, Virginia, in July 1862 and placed in commission by Commander Robert B. Pegram, as part of the James River Squadron.

During 1863 and early 1864 the James front was quiet, but from May 1864 momentous events followed in quick succession. The Confederate Navy had three new ironclads in Captain French Forrest&#x27;s James River Squadron there, and minor actions were frequent.

During 1864 &quot;Richmond&quot;, under Lieutenant William Harwar Parker, CSN, took part in engagements at Dutch Gap on August 13, Fort Harrison on September 29 – October 1, and Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff on October 22. On January 23–24, 1865, she was under heavy fire while aground with &quot;Virginia II&quot; above the obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach — at an angle that caused Federal projectiles to ricochet harmlessly off their casemates. But &quot;Richmond&quot;″s unarmored tender, , being lashed alongside &quot;Richmond&quot;, was severely damaged by the explosion of ″s magazine. The ironclads were forced to withdraw under the Confederate batteries at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. A few weeks later, however, &quot;Richmond&quot; had to be destroyed to avoid capture by order of Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes, squadron commander, prior to the evacuation of the Confederate capital on April 3.

==Commanders==
The commanders of the CSS &quot;Richmond&quot; were:

* Commander Robert B. Pegram (November 1862 – May 1864)
* Commander William Harwar Parker (May–June 1864)
* Lieutenant John S. Maury (July–October 26, 1864)
* Commander William A. Webb (October–November 1864)
* Commodore John McIntosh Kell (December 30, 1864-February 1865)
* Lieutenant Hamilton Henderson Dalton (February 1865-)
* Passed Midshipman J.A. Peters (during February 1865)

<text>First Sessions is an EP by singer Norah Jones, released in 2001. The EP was a limited release of approximately 10,000 copies which were available on Jones&#x27; website and at live shows.

==Background==
As the name suggests, &quot;First Sessions&quot; marked the first recordings made by Jones after being signed with Blue Note Records. Label A&amp;R Brian Bacchus put the singer with experienced engineer Jay Newland to record demos of around nine songs. Six of these were chosen for the sampler release &quot;First Sessions&quot;, while the remainder were set aside for consideration for her debut album &quot;Come Away with Me.&quot; Ultimately, most of the songs featured here ended up on &quot;Come Away with Me.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
*Norah Jones - piano, vocals
*Lee Alexander - bass
*Jesse Harris - guitar
*Olivier Vieser - guitar
*Dan Rieser - drums
*Adam Rogers - guitar (track 4)
*Tony Scherr - acoustic and slide guitar (track 5)

==Production==
*Recording engineer and mix: Jay Newland

<text>The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology (often simply called the MacDiarmid Institute) is a New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) specialising in materials science and nanotechnology. It is hosted by Victoria University of Wellington, and is a collaboration between five universities and two Crown Research Institutes.

==Background==

The Institute is named after Alan MacDiarmid, a New Zealander who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. It is funded by the New Zealand government through the Tertiary Education Commission.

The Institute divides its work into four research areas:
*Towards Zero Waste – Reconfigurable Systems
*Towards Zero Carbon – Catalytic Architectures
*Towards Low Energy Tech – Hardware for Future Computing
*Sustainable resource use – Mātauranga Māori Research Programme

== Awards ==
From 2004 to 2007, the MacDiarmid Institute sponsored the annual Young Scientist of the Year awards for up-and-coming scientists and researchers in New Zealand, organised by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology. These awards replaced the FiRST Scholarship Awards, and have subsequently been replaced by the Prime Minister&#x27;s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize.

<doc id="1178382" wikidata="Q1624317" url="?curid=1178382" title="English modal auxiliary verbs">
<text>The English modal auxiliary verbs are a subset of the English auxiliary verbs used mostly to express modality, properties such as possibility and obligation. They can most easily be distinguished from other verbs by their defectiveness (they do not have participles or plain forms) and by their lack of the ending (&quot;e&quot;)&quot;s&quot; for the third-person singular.

The central English modal auxiliary verbs are &quot;can&quot; (with &quot;could&quot;), &quot;may&quot; (with &quot;might&quot;), &quot;shall&quot; (with &quot;should&quot;), &quot;will&quot; (with &quot;would&quot;), and &quot;must&quot;. A few other verbs are usually also classed as modals: &quot;ought&quot;, and (in certain uses) &quot;dare&quot;, and &quot;need&quot;. &quot;Use&quot; (, rhyming with &quot;loose&quot;) is included as well. Other expressions, notably &quot;had better&quot;, share some of their characteristics. 

== Modal auxiliary verbs distinguished grammatically ==

A list of what tend to be regarded as modal auxiliary verbs in Modern English, along with their inflected forms, is shown in the following table.

Contractions are shown only if their orthography is distinctive. There are also unstressed versions that are typically, although not necessarily, written in the standard way. Where there is a blank, the modal auxiliary verb lacks this form. (A corresponding lexical verb may have the form. For example, although the lexical verb &quot;need&quot; has a preterite form, the modal auxiliary verb &quot;need&quot; does not.)

=== Criteria for modal auxiliary verbs ===

Descriptive grammars of English differ slightly on the criteria they set for modal auxiliary verbs. According to &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, the criteria are as follows.

==== Auxiliary verbs ====

Modal auxiliary verbs are a subset of auxiliary verbs and thus meet the criteria for these. For lists of those criteria, see the article English auxiliary verbs, but among them are that the verbs (i) can invert with their subjects (notably in questions, Must I go?&quot;), (ii) can be negated with &quot;not&quot; (&quot;I must not go&quot;; Must I not go?&quot;), and (iii) have negative inflected forms (&quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot;).

==== No untensed forms ====

To illustrate untensed forms, those of the irregular lexical verb &quot;take&quot; and the non-modal auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot; are the plain &quot;take&quot; and &quot;be&quot; (as in &quot;Take it!&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t take it&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t be silly&quot;), the gerund-participles &quot;taking&quot; and &quot;being&quot;, and the past participles &quot;taken&quot; and &quot;been&quot;.

Modal auxiliary verbs lack untensed forms. Attempting to use them brings ungrammatical results:

*&quot;I will can drive if I take ten lessons.&quot;
*&quot;Canning drive would be helpful.&quot;
*&quot;I have could/canned drive since I was 18.&quot; 

Compare the grammaticality of non-modal auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot; in &quot;I will be able to drive&quot;, &quot;being able to drive&quot;, and &quot;I have been able to drive&quot;.

==== No subject–verb agreement ====

This refers to agreement of a verb (in present tense) with its third-person singular subject:

*&quot;She can/*cans try.&quot; 

Compare lexical verb &quot;try&quot; in &quot;She tries/*try&quot;, and non-modal auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot; in &quot;She does/*do try&quot;.

&quot;Had better&quot; and (as an auxiliary verb) &quot;used&quot; lack present tense forms. Other than in the present tense, even lexical verbs lack subject agreement and so this test is inapplicable to either &quot;had better&quot; or &quot;used&quot;.

==== Only a bare infinitival clause as complement ====

Whereas the lexical verb &quot;seem&quot; takes a &quot;to&quot;-infinitival clause (&quot;It seemed to happen&quot;), and the non-modal auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot; takes a past participial clause complement (&quot;It has happened&quot;), a modal auxiliary verb can, in principle, take only a bare infinitival clause (a subordinate clause with the plain form of the verb without &quot;to&quot;) as its complement:

*&quot;It can be a surprise.&quot; 
*&quot;It can to be a surprise.&quot; 
*&quot;It can being a surprise.&quot; 

If they are modal auxiliary verbs, then &quot;ought&quot; and &quot;used&quot; are exceptions to this (although &quot;ought&quot; is increasingly used with a bare infinitival clause complement). 

Bare infinitival clause complements are not unique to modal auxiliary verbs. &quot;Do&quot; is a non-modal auxiliary verb that takes one (&quot;Did you move the piano?&quot;); &quot;help&quot; is a lexical verb that can do so (&quot;I helped move the piano&quot;).

==== Ability to occur in remote apodosis ====

An &quot;apodosis&quot; is the &quot;then&quot; half of a conditional statement. (The &quot;if&quot; half is the &quot;protasis&quot;.) &quot;Remote&quot; here means &quot;thought by the speaker to be unlikely&quot; or &quot;known by the speaker to be untrue&quot;.

*&quot;If I were an elephant, I would eat more apples.&quot;

Compare lexical verb &quot;eat&quot; in *&quot;If I were an elephant, I ate more apples&quot;, and non-modal auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot; in *&quot;If I were an elephant, I was able to eat more apples&quot;.

&quot;Must&quot; satisfies this only for a minority of speakers, and it is questionable whether &quot;had better&quot; does so.

&quot;The Cambridge Grammar&quot; comments on &quot;may&quot; that:

here there is evidence that for some speakers &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot; have diverged to the extent that they are no longer inflectional forms of a single lexeme, but belong to distinct lexemes, &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot;, each of which – like &quot;must&quot; – lacks a preterite...

&quot;Used&quot; does not satisfy this.

==== Preterite usable in the main clause for modal remoteness ====

*&quot;I could drive there, I suppose.&quot;

If similarly intended (as a doubtful or incredulous contemplation of an option for the future), attempts at this with a lexical or non-modal auxiliary verb are ungrammatical: *&quot;I drove there, I suppose&quot;; *&quot;I was going to drive there, I suppose&quot;. 

Other than when used for backshift, &quot;should&quot; has diverged in meaning so far from &quot;shall&quot; be usable here only with difficulty. As they lack preterite forms, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;ought&quot; and &quot;need&quot; cannot be used in this way, and so that criterion does not apply to them. And &quot;used&quot; describes the past, not the present or future.

==== Comments ====

The following verbs, shown in present–preterite pairs, satisfy or come close to satisfying all of the above criteria and can be classed as the central modal verbs of English:
* &quot;can&quot; (with &quot;could&quot;)
* &quot;will&quot; (with &quot;would&quot;)
* &quot;may&quot; (with &quot;might&quot;) – although the lack in today&#x27;s Standard English of a negative present inflection (*&quot;mayn&#x27;t&quot;) means that it fails one of the criteria for auxiliary verbs
* &quot;shall&quot; (with &quot;should&quot;) – although the semantic divergence of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; means that its success with one criterion is debatable
* &quot;must&quot; – although its lack of a preterite (see its etymology below) means that it neither passes nor fails one of the criteria

Even for lexical verbs, preterite forms have uses besides referring to the past, but for modal auxiliary verbs, such uses are particularly important: (&quot;Could you pass me the sauce?&quot;; &quot;Without my phone I might easily be lost&quot;; &quot;You should work harder&quot;; &quot;I would avoid that street&quot;).

Ought, dare, need, and used satisfy some of the criteria above, and are more (&quot;ought&quot;, &quot;dare&quot;, &quot;need&quot;) or less (&quot;used&quot;) often categorized as modal verbs. Had better is sometimes called a modal idiom. 

Other English auxiliary verbs appear in a variety of different forms and are not regarded as modal verbs:
* &quot;be&quot;, used as an auxiliary verb in passive voice, continuous aspect and indeed in virtually all of its uses, even as a copula;
* &quot;have&quot;, used as an auxiliary verb in perfect aspect constructions and the idiom &quot;have got&quot; (&quot;to&quot;); it is also used in &quot;have to&quot;, which has modal meaning, but here (as when denoting possession (very broadly understood)) &quot;have&quot; only rarely follows auxiliary verb syntax;
* &quot;do&quot;, see &quot;do&quot;-support;
* &quot;to&quot;, of &quot;to&quot;-infinitival clauses (if &quot;to&quot; is a defective verb, not a subordinator).

=== Lists of modal auxiliary verbs ===

Five recent scholarly descriptions of verbs disagree among themselves on the extension of modal auxiliary verb: on which verbs are modal auxiliary verbs.

They agree that can (with could), may (with might), must, shall (with should) and will (with would) are, or are among, the &quot;central modal auxiliaries&quot; (&quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot;, 1985), &quot;secondary or modal auxiliaries&quot; (F. R. Palmer, 1988), &quot;modal auxiliaries&quot; (Anthony R. Warner, 1993), &quot;central members of the modal auxiliary class&quot; (&quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, 2002), or &quot;core modal verbs&quot; (Bas Aarts, 2011).

Among these five verbs, &quot;The Cambridge Grammar&quot; selects the pair &quot;can&quot; and &quot;will&quot; (with &quot;could&quot; and &quot;would&quot;) as &quot;the most straightforward of the modal auxiliaries&quot;. Peter Collins agrees.

All five accord ought, need and dare a less clear or merely a marginal membership.

&quot;A Comprehensive Grammar&quot; and Warner do likewise for use; the other three deny that it is a modal auxiliary verb. For that reason, it is discussed primarily not in this article but in English auxiliary verbs.)

As for would in would rather, would sooner and would as soon, and have in had better, had best and had rather, only &quot;The Cambridge Grammar&quot; notes all six, but each of the other four descriptions of auxiliary verbs notes three or more. Of the three to six idioms that each discussion notes, there is no variation in the status that it accords to them. Warner calls the three that he notes (&quot;would rather&quot;, &quot;had better&quot;, &quot;had rather&quot;) modal auxiliaries. Palmer says that the same three are &quot;not&quot; modal auxiliaries. Both &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar&quot; and Aarts use the term modal idiom for a choice of five. &quot;The Cambridge Grammar&quot; sees modal characteristics in all six uses of these two auxiliary verbs.

&quot;A Comprehensive Grammar&quot; calls both have got (&quot;Ive got to go now&quot;) and be to (&quot;You are to hand over the cash&quot;) modal idioms. None of the other descriptions agrees.

Palmer calls &quot;be bound&quot;/&quot;able&quot;/&quot;going&quot;/&quot;willing to&quot; and &quot;have&quot; (&quot;got&quot;) &quot;to&quot; semi-modals. &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar&quot; calls &quot;be able&quot;/&quot;about&quot;/&quot;apt&quot;/&quot;bound&quot;/&quot;due&quot;/&quot;going&quot;/&quot;likely&quot;/&quot;meant&quot;/&quot;obliged&quot;/&quot;supposed&quot;/&quot;willing to&quot; and &quot;have to&quot; semi-auxiliaries. He adds, &quot;The boundaries of this category are not clear&quot;.

==Etymology==
The modals &quot;can&quot; and &quot;could&quot; are from Old English &quot;can&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;cuþ&quot;, which were respectively the present and preterite forms of the verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;be able&quot;). The silent &quot;l&quot; in the spelling of &quot;could&quot; results from analogy with &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot;.

Similarly, &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot; are from Old English &quot;mæg&quot; and &quot;meahte&quot;, respectively the present and preterite forms of &quot;&quot; (&quot;may, to be able&quot;); &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are from &quot;sceal&quot; and &quot;sceolde&quot;, respectively the present and preterite forms of &quot;&quot; (&quot;owe, be obliged&quot;); and &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; are from &quot;wille&quot; and &quot;wolde&quot;, respectively the present and preterite forms of &quot;&quot; (&quot;wish, want&quot;).

The aforementioned Old English verbs &quot;cunnan&quot;, &quot;magan&quot;, &quot;sculan&quot;, and &quot;willan&quot; followed the preterite-present paradigm (or, in the case of &quot;willan&quot;, a similar but irregular paradigm), which explains the absence of the ending &quot;-s&quot; in the third-person present forms &quot;can&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, and &quot;will&quot;. (The original Old English forms given above were first- and third-person singular forms; their descendant forms have become generalized to all persons and numbers.)

The verb &quot;must&quot; comes from Old English &quot;moste&quot;, part of the verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;be able/obliged (to do something)&quot;). This was another preterite-present verb, of which &quot;moste&quot; was in fact the preterite (the present form &quot;mot&quot; gave rise to &quot;&quot;, which was used as a modal verb in Early Modern English, but &quot;must&quot; has now lost its past connotations and has replaced &quot;mote&quot;). Similarly, &quot;ought&quot; was originally a past form—it derives from &quot;ahte&quot;, preterite of &quot;&quot; (&quot;own&quot;), another Old English preterite-present verb whose present tense form, &quot;ah&quot;, has also given the modern (regular) verb &quot;owe&quot;, and &quot;ought&quot; was formerly used as a preterite form of &quot;owe&quot;.

The verb &quot;dare&quot; also originates from a preterite-present verb, &quot;durran&quot; (&quot;dare&quot;), specifically its present tense &quot;dear&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) although in its non-modal uses in Modern English, it is conjugated regularly. However, &quot;need&quot; comes from the regular Old English verb &quot;neodian&quot; (meaning &quot;be necessary&quot;)—the alternative third person form &quot;need&quot; (in place of &quot;needs&quot;), which has become the norm in modal uses, became common in the 16th century.

==Preterite forms==
The preterite forms given above (&quot;could&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, and &quot;would&quot;, corresponding to &quot;can&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, and &quot;will&quot;, respectively) do not always simply modify the meaning of the modal to give it past reference. The only one regularly used as an ordinary past tense is &quot;could&quot; when referring to ability: &quot;I could swim&quot; may serve as a past form of &quot;I can swim&quot;.

All the preterites are used as past equivalents for the corresponding present modals in indirect speech and similar clauses requiring the rules of sequence of tenses to be applied. For example, if it were said in 1960 that &quot;People think that we will all be driving hovercars by the year 2000&quot;, it might now be reported that &quot;In 1960, people thought we would all be driving hovercars by the year 2000.&quot;

This &quot;future-in-the-past&quot; (also known as the past prospective) use of &quot;would&quot; can also occur in a main clause: &quot;I moved to Green Gables in 1930; I would live there for the next ten years.&quot;

In many cases, in order to give modals past reference, they are used together with the auxiliary &quot;have&quot; and a past participle, as in &quot;I should have asked her&quot;; &quot;You may have seen me&quot;. Sometimes these expressions are limited in meaning; for example, &quot;must have&quot; can refer only to certainty, whereas past obligation is expressed by an alternative phrase such as &quot;had to&quot; (see below).

===Conditional sentences===
The preterite forms of modals are used in the apodosis (&quot;then&quot;-clause) of counterfactual conditional sentences. The modal &quot;would&quot; (or &quot;should&quot; as a first-person alternative) is used to produce the conditional construction typically used in clauses of this type: &quot;If you loved me, you would support me.&quot; It can be replaced by &quot;could&quot; (meaning &quot;would be able (to do something)&quot;) and &quot;might&quot; (meaning &quot;would possibly&quot;) as appropriate.

When the clause has past reference, the construction with the modal plus &quot;have&quot; (see above) is used: &quot;If they (had) wanted to do it, they would (could/might) have done it by now.&quot; (The &quot;would have done&quot; construction is called the conditional perfect.)

The protasis (&quot;if&quot;-clause) of such a sentence typically contains the preterite form of a verb (or the past perfect construction, for past reference), without any modal. The modal &quot;could&quot; may be used here in its role of the preterite form of &quot;can&quot; (&quot;if I could speak French&quot;). However, all the modal preterites can be used in such clauses with certain types of hypothetical future reference: &quot;if I should lose&quot; or &quot;should I lose&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if I lose&quot;); &quot;if you would/might/could stop doing that&quot; (usually used as a form of request).

Sentences with the verb &quot;wish&quot; and expressions of wish using &quot;if only...&quot; follow similar patterns to the &quot;if&quot;-clauses that are referred to above when they have counterfactual present or past reference. When they express a desired event in the near future, the modal &quot;would&quot; is used: &quot;I wish you would visit me&quot;; &quot;If only he would give me a sign.&quot;

For more information see English conditional sentences.

== Second-person singular forms ==
Early Modern English often distinguished between second-person plural &quot;you&quot; (or &quot;ye&quot;) and second-person singular &quot;thou&quot;. Rather as English verbs other than modal auxiliaries agree with third-person singular subjects in today&#x27;s English, Early Modern English verbs in general (modal auxiliaries included) agreed with a second-person subject that was distinctively singular. (There was no such agreement with instances of &quot;you&quot; or &quot;ye&quot; that happened to have singular reference.) Examples from Shakespeare are shown below.

==Replacements for defective forms==
As noted above, English modal verbs are defective in that they do not have any untensed form, or, for some, preterite form. However, in many cases, expressions can carry the same meaning as the modal and be used to supply the missing forms:
*The modals &quot;can&quot; and &quot;could&quot;, expressing ability, can be replaced by &quot;be able to&quot;, with the appropriate inflection of &quot;be&quot;.
*The modals &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot;, expressing permission, can be replaced by &quot;be allowed to&quot;, again with the appropriate inflection of &quot;be&quot;. 
*The modal &quot;must&quot; in most meanings can be replaced by &quot;have to&quot;, with the appropriate inflection of &quot;have&quot;.
*When used for futurity, &quot;will&quot; can be replaced by &quot;be going to&quot;, with the appropriate inflection of &quot;be&quot;.
*The modals &quot;should&quot; and &quot;ought to&quot; might be replaced by &quot;be supposed to&quot;, again with the appropriate inflection of &quot;be&quot;.

==Weak forms==
Most of the modals have negative inflected forms: &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, etc. Although they started as weak forms (contractions), they are no longer so. Genuine contractions are:

* &quot;can&quot; → 
* &quot;could&quot; → 
* &quot;shall&quot; → 
* &quot;should&quot; → 
* &quot;will&quot; → , 
* &quot;would&quot; → , 
* &quot;had better&quot; → , , 

When &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are first-person replacements for &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot;, they too may take the weak forms &quot;ll&quot; and &quot;d&quot;.

A combination like &quot;should have&quot; is normally reduced to or just &quot;shoulda&quot;. Also, &quot;ought to&quot; can become &quot;oughta&quot;. See weak and strong forms in English.

== Effect of negation ==
Either or both of two kinds of negation can apply to a construction using a modal auxiliary verb. What is called internal negation is limited to the subordinate clause. The difference between &quot;He might have overheard you&quot; and &quot;He might not have overheard you&quot; (with internal negation) is that between &quot;It is possible that he overheard you&quot; and &quot;It is possible that he did not overhear you&quot;.

By contrast, what is called external negation applies to the matrix clause. The difference between &quot;He could have overheard you&quot; and &quot;He couldn&#x27;t have overheard you&quot; (with external negation) is that between &quot;It is possible that he overheard you&quot; and &quot;It is not possible that he overheard you&quot;.

&quot;Not&quot; can be moved into the subordinate clause. &quot;He might have not overheard you&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;He might not have overheard you&quot;; but &quot;He could have not overheard you&quot; means &quot;It is possible that he did not overhear you&quot;.

The two kinds of negation can be combined. &quot;He can&#x27;t have not overheard you&quot; means &quot;It is not possible that he did not overhear you&quot;.

Likewise, the difference between &quot;You mustn&#x27;t apologize&quot; and &quot;You needn&#x27;t apologize&quot; is that the former shows internal negation, inverting the necessity; the latter external negation, negating the necessity.

Whether negating a modal auxiliary verb brings negation of the subordinate or the matrix clause (internal or external negation respectively) thus depends on the particular verb, which in turn partly depends on the strength of the modality that the verb expresses, and there may be other determining factors as well. However: &quot;Negative interrogatives, used as questions biased towards a positive answer, have external negation irrespective of the strength of the modality [. . .] A special case is in tags: &quot;We must stop soon, mustn&#x27;t we?&quot;&quot;

== Usage of specific verbs ==
===&quot;Can&quot; and &quot;could&quot;=== 

The modal verb &quot;can&quot; expresses possibility in a dynamic, deontic, or epistemic sense, that is, in terms of innate ability, permissibility, or probability. For example:
*Dynamic
**Ability: &quot;You needn&#x27;t struggle with your Tamil when talking to me: I can speak English&quot; (&quot;I am capable of speaking English&quot;; &quot;I know how to speak English&quot;)
**Existential: &quot;Most siblings get along at least tolerably well, but there can be strong rivalry between them&quot; (such rivalry does sometimes occur)
**The reasonable/acceptable: &quot;You can be a few minutes late; nobody will mind&quot;
**The circumstantially possible: &quot;Petrol left for months in an unused car can wreck its fuel line&quot; (This is the result of a predictable chemical process that is not being prevented.)
*Deontic: &quot;Smoking is forbidden anywhere in this building, but you can smoke behind the bicycle shed&quot; (&quot;You are permitted to smoke here&quot;) 
*Epistemic: &quot;He did the &quot;Ironman&quot; in under seven hours? That can&#x27;t be true.&quot; (&quot;It is impossible for that to be true.&quot;)

The preterite form &quot;could&quot; is used as the past tense or remote conditional form of &quot;can&quot; in the above meanings (see above). It is also used to express likelihood: &quot;We could be in trouble here.&quot; It is preferable to use &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot; rather than &quot;can&quot; when expressing likelihood in a particular situation (as opposed to the general case, as in the &quot;rivalry&quot; example above, where &quot;can&quot; or &quot;may&quot; is used).

Both &quot;can&quot; and &quot;could&quot; can be used to make requests: Can/could you pass me the cheese?&quot; means &quot;Please pass me the cheese&quot; (where &quot;could&quot; is more polite). Either can be used with &quot;possibly&quot;: Can/could you possibly pass me the cheese?&quot; Requests with &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; may sound impatient (&quot;Can&#x27;t you be quiet?&quot;)

It is common to use &quot;can&quot; with verbs of perception such as &quot;see&quot;, &quot;hear&quot;, etc., as in &quot;I can see a tree&quot;. Aspectual distinctions can be made, such as &quot;I could see it&quot; (ongoing state) vs. &quot;I saw it&quot; (event).

&quot;Could have&quot; expresses counterfactual past ability or possibility: &quot;I could have told him if I had seen him&quot;; &quot;I could have told him yesterday&quot; (but I didn&#x27;t).

&quot;Can have...&quot; is less common than &quot;may have...&quot;.

&quot;Can&quot; may be negated by the addition of &quot;not&quot; , analogously to the addition of &quot;not&quot; to &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;will&quot; and so forth. It can also be negated by inflection; its commoner inflected form is &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; , , or (in RP, General American and General Australian respectively). However, it has an alternative inflected form, &quot;cannot&quot; . &quot;Can not&quot; and &quot;cannot&quot; thus differ in placement of the single stress. &quot;Can not&quot; is more formal than &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, and does not invert with its subject (&quot;Can&#x27;t/*Cannot we leave now?&quot;).

Negated, &quot;could&quot; has the inflected form &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;.

Negating &quot;can&quot; or &quot;could&quot; is external and negates the matrix clause, expressing inability, impermissibility or impossibility (&quot;I can&#x27;t wear jeans&quot;). This differs from &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot; used to express possibility: &quot;It can&#x27;t be true&quot; does not mean &quot;It may not be true&quot;. Thus &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; (or &quot;cannot&quot;) is often used to express disbelief even in possibility, as &quot;must&quot; expresses belief in the certainty. When the reference is to the past, &quot;have&quot; is used: &quot;He can&#x27;t/cannot have done it&quot; means &quot;It is not possible that he did it&quot; (compare &quot;He must have done it&quot;).

With special stress, internal negation is possible: &quot;I can wear a suit, if I wish&quot; means &quot;I am not compelled to wear a suit if I don&#x27;t want to&quot;.

===&quot;May&quot; and &quot;might&quot;===
The verb &quot;may&quot; expresses possibility in either an epistemic or deontic sense, that is, in terms of probability or permissibility. For example:
*&quot;The mouse may be dead&quot; means that it is possible that the mouse (perhaps audible until the day before) is now dead.
*&quot;Trevor may leave if he&#x27;d prefer to play with his friends&quot; means that Trevor is permitted to leave.
&quot;May&quot; can have future as well as present reference (&quot;He may arrive&quot; means that it is possible that he will arrive; &quot;I may go to the mall&quot; means that I am considering going to the mall).

The preterite form &quot;might&quot; is used as a synonym of &quot;may&quot; to express a possible circumstance (as can &quot;could&quot; – see above). It is sometimes said that &quot;might&quot; and &quot;could&quot; express more doubt than &quot;may&quot;. For uses of &quot;might&quot; in conditional sentences, and as a past equivalent to &quot;may&quot; in such contexts as indirect speech, see above.

&quot;May&quot; (or &quot;might&quot;) can also express concession of a minor point: &quot;He may be taller than me, but he&#x27;s certainly not stronger&quot; could mean &quot;While I&#x27;d agree that he is taller than me, that is unimportant, as he&#x27;s certainly not stronger.&quot;

&quot;May&quot; can indicate permission for present or future actions, or be a polite directive: &quot;You may go now&quot;. &quot;Might&quot; used in this way is milder: &quot;You might go now if you feel like it.&quot; Similarly, &quot;May I use your phone?&quot; is a request for permission; &quot;Might I use your phone?&quot; would be more hesitant or polite.

A less common use of &quot;may&quot; is optative (to express a wish), as in &quot;May you live long and happy&quot; (see also English subjunctive).

&quot;May have&quot; indicates uncertainty about a past circumstance, whereas &quot;might have&quot; can either have that meaning or refer to possibilities that did not occur but could have (see also conditional sentences above).
* &quot;She may have eaten the cake.&quot; (The speaker does not know whether she did.)
* &quot;She might have eaten the cake.&quot; (The speaker either does not know whether she did, or knows that she did not eat cake but that her eating it would have been possible.)

&quot;May have&quot; is used for possibility, not permission (although the second sense of &quot;might have&quot; might sometimes imply permission).

The inflected form &quot;mayn&#x27;t&quot; is obsolete. The inflected form &quot;mightn&#x27;t&quot; mostly appears in the tags of tag questions (&quot;It might snow tonight, mightn&#x27;t it?&quot;) and in other questions expressing doubt (&quot;Mightn&#x27;t I come in if I took my boots off?&quot;).

The result of negating &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot; depends on whether the interpretation is epistemic (about likelihood) or deontic (about permission). In epistemic senses, the negation is &quot;internal&quot;, of the subordinate clause (&quot;There may not be a vote on it this week&quot;). In deontic senses, the negation is normally external (&quot;You may not go to the party unless you finish your homework&quot;), but with special stress, internal negation is possible: (&quot;I may attend church, if I wish&quot;, meaning &quot;I have permission not to attend church&quot;).

===&quot;Shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; ===
The verb &quot;shall&quot; is used in some varieties of English in place of &quot;will&quot; when the subject is first person (&quot;I shall, we shall&quot;).

With second- and third-person subjects, &quot;shall&quot; indicates a directive or prophecy: &quot;Cinderella, you shall go to the ball!&quot; It is often used in writing laws and specifications: &quot;Those convicted of violating this law shall be imprisoned for a term of not less than three years&quot;; &quot;The device shall be able to operate within a normal temperature range.&quot;

&quot;Shall&quot; is sometimes used in requests for advice or confirmation of a suggestion: &quot;Shall I read now?&quot;; &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;

&quot;Should&quot; is sometimes used as a first-person equivalent to &quot;would&quot; (in its conditional and &quot;future-in-the-past&quot; uses) in the same way that &quot;shall&quot; can replace &quot;will&quot;. &quot;Should&quot; is also used for a protasis with future reference: either with the preposition &quot;if&quot; (&quot;If you should meet her, please give her this&quot;) or with subject–auxiliary inversion (&quot;Should you meet her, please give her this&quot;).

&quot;Should&quot; is often used to describe an expected or recommended act or state. It can be used to give advice or to describe normative behavior, though without such strong obligatory force as &quot;must&quot; or &quot;have to&quot;. Thus, &quot;You should never lie&quot; describes a social or ethical norm. It can also express what is expected: &quot;This should work.&quot; In these uses it is equivalent to &quot;ought&quot;.

Both &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; can be used with &quot;have&quot; (&quot;shall/should have&quot; (&quot;done&quot;)) in their role as first-person equivalents of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; (thus to form future perfect or conditional perfect structures). Also, &quot;shall have&quot; may express an order with perfective aspect (&quot;You shall have finished your duties by nine o&#x27;clock&quot;). When &quot;should&quot; is used in that way, it usually expresses something that would have been expected at some time in the past but did not in fact happen (or is not known to have happened): &quot;I should have done that yesterday&quot; (&quot;It would have been expedient, or expected of me, to do that yesterday&quot;).

The negative inflections are &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;.

Negating &quot;should&quot; negates the subordinate clause: the negation is internal (&quot;You shouldn&#x27;t use botox&quot;). (To negate the meaning of &quot;I should&quot;, one may use&quot;I ought not to&quot; or &quot;I am not supposed to&quot;.)

As for any modal auxiliary, a negative interrogative (&quot;Shouldn&#x27;t you check your credit card statement?&quot;) instead negates the matrix clause.

===&quot;Will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; ===

* &quot;Will&quot; often expresses futurity (&quot;The next meeting will be held on Thursday&quot;). Since this is an expression of time rather than modality, constructions with &quot;will&quot; (or sometimes &quot;shall&quot;; see &quot;&quot;Shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot;&quot; above) are often called the future tense. For those speakers who for first-person subjects (&quot;I&quot;, &quot;we&quot;) use &quot;shall&quot; to express futurity, the use of &quot;will&quot; for these indicates particular resolve. (Future events are also sometimes described with the present tense (see Uses of English verb forms), or using the &quot;going to&quot; construction.)
* &quot;Will&quot; can express habitual aspect or dynamic modality; for example, &quot;He will make mistakes&quot; (in which &quot;will&quot; is usually stressed somewhat) may mean that he seems often to make them.

&quot;Will&quot; also has these uses as a modal:
* It can express strong probability with present time reference, as in &quot;That will be John at the door&quot;.
* It can be used to give an indirect order, as in &quot;You will do it right now&quot;.

Modal uses of the preterite form &quot;would&quot; include:
* &quot;Would&quot; is used in some conditional sentences.
* Expression of politeness, as in &quot;I would like to...&quot; (to politely state a preference) and &quot;Would you (be so kind as to) do this?&quot; (for &quot;Please do this&quot;).

As a tense marker, &quot;would&quot; is used for
* Future of the past, as in &quot;I knew I would graduate two years later&quot;. &quot;Would&quot; is the past form of future &quot;will&quot; as described above under . (It is sometimes replaced by &quot;should&quot; in the first person in the same way that &quot;will&quot; is replaced by &quot;shall&quot;.)

As an aspect marker, &quot;would&quot; is used for
* Expression of habitual aspect in the past, as in &quot;Back then, I would eat early and would walk to school.&quot;

Both &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; can be used with &quot;have&quot; (&quot;will have&quot;, &quot;would have&quot;) to form the future perfect and conditional perfect forms already referred to, or to express perfective aspect in their other meanings (e.g. &quot;there will have been an arrest order&quot;, expressing strong probability).

The negative inflections are &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot;. For contracted forms of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; themselves, see &quot;Weak forms&quot;, above.

Negating &quot;will&quot; or &quot;would&quot; is &quot;internal&quot; and negates the subordinate clause. (&quot;I won&#x27;t be surprised if it rains&quot; means &quot;I will be unsurprised if it rains&quot;.) But as for any modal auxiliary, a negative interrogative (Won&#x27;t/&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t we submit them in person?&quot;) negates the matrix clause.

====&quot;Would rather&quot;, &quot;would sooner&quot;, and &quot;would as soon&quot;==== 
&quot;Would rather&quot;, &quot;would sooner&quot;, or &quot;would as soon&quot; can take as its complement either a bare infinitival clause (&quot;She would rather go herself&quot;) or a declarative content clause (&quot;She would rather &quot;(&quot;that&quot;)&quot; I went&quot;). They are PPIs: although &quot;I would rather not catch the virus&quot; (with negation of the clause that is subordinate to &quot;would rather&quot;) is idiomatic, *&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t rather catch the virus&quot; (with negation of the matrix clause) is distinctly strange. Whether its reference is to past, present or future, the declarative content clause complement can use the preterite: &quot;Id rather you hadn&#x27;t told her that&quot; (past counterfactual); &quot;Id rather you didn&#x27;t tell her that&quot; (present/future); &quot;Id rather you didn&#x27;t tell her that when you meet her&quot; (future).

===&quot;Must&quot; ===
&quot;Must&quot; differs from the central modal auxiliary verbs in lacking a preterite. It expresses obligation or necessity: &quot;You must use this form&quot;; &quot;We must try to escape&quot;. It can also express a conclusion reached by indirect evidence (e.g. &quot;Sue must be at home&quot;).

When used with &quot;have&quot; and a past participle, &quot;must&quot; has only an epistemic flavor: &quot;Sue must have left&quot; means that the speaker concludes that Sue has left. To express obligation or necessity in the past, &quot;had to&quot; or some other synonym must be used.

The negative inflection of &quot;must&quot; is &quot;mustn&#x27;t&quot;. Negation of &quot;must&quot; is &quot;internal&quot;, negating the subordinate clause: (&quot;You must not/mustn&#x27;t drive after smoking a joint&quot; means that not driving is what you must do). But as for any modal auxiliary, a negative interrogative (&quot;Mustn&#x27;t we hide the dope?&quot;) negates the matrix clause. To express the lack of requirement or obligation, the negative of &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;need&quot; (see below) can be used: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to do this&quot;; &quot;You needn&#x27;t do this&quot;.

Negated, &quot;must&quot; is not commonly used in an epistemic sense, where it is common to use &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; (&quot;It can&#x27;t be here&quot;; &quot;Sue can&#x27;t have left&quot;) instead.

&quot;Mustn&#x27;t&quot; can nonetheless be used as a simple negative of &quot;must&quot; in tag questions and other questions expressing doubt: &quot;We must do it, mustn&#x27;t we? Mustn&#x27;t he be in the operating room by this stage?&quot;

&quot;Must&quot; and &quot;needs&quot; can occur in sequence. Hendrik Poutsma writes that &quot;The force of &quot;must&quot;, notably that of representing the subject under pressure of an overmastering desire [. . . ], is often emphasized by &quot;needs&quot;.&quot; Examples of the pair are:
*&quot;The control of the Firm needs must stay within the Family.&quot;
*&quot;It needs must be said that any observation made in this order shall not be taken as observations on merits&quot;
*&quot;thinking it through to its ultimate logical consequences must needs lead to insoluble contradictions&quot;
*&quot;the Constitution envisions, and by extension the country as a whole must needs have, a truly high-minded Supreme Court&quot;

===&quot;Ought&quot; ===
&quot;Ought&quot; differs from the central modal auxiliary verbs both in taking as its complement a &quot;to&quot;-infinitival rather than a bare infinitival clause (compare &quot;He should go&quot; with &quot;He ought to go&quot;) and in lacking a preterite.

&quot;Ought&quot; is used with meanings similar to those of &quot;should&quot;, expressing expectation or requirement. 

The reduced pronunciation of &quot;ought to&quot; (see &quot;Weak forms&quot; above) is sometimes spelt &quot;oughtta&quot;.

&quot;Ought&quot; can be used with &quot;have&quot; in the same way as &quot;should&quot; (plus intervening &quot;to&quot;): &quot;You ought to have done that earlier&quot;. &quot;Ought not to&quot; or &quot;oughtn&#x27;t to&quot; can be substituted for &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;. 

&quot;Had better&quot; has a similar meaning to &quot;should&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; for a deontic meaning (expressing recommended or expedient behavior (&quot;You ought to &quot;/&quot; should &quot;/&quot; had better arrive on time&quot;), but not (other perhaps than jokingly) for an epistemic meaning (&quot;The Sun ought to &quot;/&quot; should &quot;/ ?&quot;had better come out soon&quot;).

Negating &quot;ought&quot; is &quot;internal&quot; and negates the subordinate clause (&quot;I ought not to have a third glassful&quot; means that what I ought to do is decline the glassful). But as for any modal auxiliary, a negative interrogative (&quot;Oughtn&#x27;t we to offer cola as well as beer?&quot;) negates the matrix clause.

The use of &quot;ought&quot; as a lexical verb as in &quot;They didn&#x27;t ought to go&quot; is generally thought of as restricted to nonstandard dialects but has been described as also sometimes found in informal standard usage. &quot;Lexical &quot;ought&quot; with the dummy operator &quot;do&quot; has been condemned in British usage handbooks. . . . What this censure suggests is that lexical &quot;ought&quot; with periphrastic &quot;do&quot; is a well-established usage in colloquial [British English].&quot;

Data from a corpus of American and British spoken and written English of the 1980s and 1990s show that &quot;ought not to&quot;, &quot;oughtn&#x27;t to&quot; (both modal auxiliary) and &quot;didn&#x27;t ought to&quot; are rare in both American and British English, whether written or spoken. &quot;I don&#x27;t think you ought to&quot; and similar are commonly used instead. In interrogatives, &quot;ought&quot; does not appear in American conversation or fiction or in British conversation. In British fiction, the modal auxiliary is used (&quot;Ought we to . . . ?&quot;), not lexical &quot;ought&quot; with &quot;do&quot;-support.

=== &quot;Need&quot; ===
As a modal auxiliary verb, &quot;need&quot; is a negative polarity item, appearing in negative contexts and other contexts that do not affirm. Thus:
* &quot;We need not remain silent.&quot;
* &quot;Need we remain silent?&quot;
* &quot;We need remain silent.&quot;

Like &quot;must&quot;, modal &quot;need&quot; has no preterite form.

Although as a modal auxiliary verb &quot;need&quot; takes a bare infinitival clause complement (&quot;He needn&#x27;t overhaul it&quot;), lexical verb &quot;need&quot; can take either an object complement (&quot;He needs my help&quot;) or a &quot;to&quot;-infinitival clause complement (&quot;He needs to overhaul it&quot;), optionally with a subject (&quot;He needs me to overhaul it&quot;). 

Negation of &quot;need&quot; is external, negating the matrix clause. &quot;You needn&#x27;t apply again&quot; does not say that there is a need not to apply, merely that there is no need to apply. So although the verb &quot;must&quot; can usually be substituted for the modal verb &quot;need&quot;, &quot;mustn&#x27;t&quot; usually cannot be substituted for &quot;needn&#x27;t&quot;. (Exceptionally, the pair are synonymous in polar interrogatives: &quot;Needn&#x27;t/mustn&#x27;t we pay now?&quot;)

Modal &quot;need&quot; can also be used with &quot;have&quot;: &quot;Need I have done that?&quot; It is most commonly used here in the negative, meaning that an action was (from the present perspective) not in fact necessary: &quot;You needn&#x27;t have left that tip&quot;.

Data from a corpus of American and British spoken and written English of the 1980s and 1990s show that for negative constructions involving &quot;need&quot;, modal auxiliary &quot;need&quot; is more common in written English (both American and British, but is less common than lexical &quot;need&quot; in British English conversation and unused in American English conversation.163 In both American and British English, interrogative constructions that require subject–auxiliary inversion show &quot;do&quot;-support of lexical &quot;need&quot; much more commonly than inversion of auxiliary &quot;need&quot;; moreover, many of what instances there are of auxiliary &quot;need&quot; are of fixed formulas (&quot;Need I say more?&quot;, etc).

&quot;For &quot;needs must&quot; (and &quot;must needs&quot;) see under must&quot;.

===&quot;Dare&quot; ===
As a modal auxiliary verb, &quot;dare&quot; is another negative negative polarity item, appearing in negative contexts and other contexts that do not affirm. 

&quot;Dare&quot; is now much more common as a lexical verb. Lexical verb &quot;dare&quot; takes a &quot;to&quot;-infinitival clause as its complement (&quot;I didn&#x27;t dare to answer her&quot;), and this may have a subject (&quot;He dared me to dive from a higher board&quot;); modal &quot;dare&quot;, a bare infinitival clause complement. 

Negation of &quot;dare&quot; is external: what is negated is the matrix clause. (&quot;She dare not attempt it&quot; means &quot;She doesn&#x27;t dare to attempt it&quot;.)

Examples of the use of modal auxiliary &quot;dare&quot;, followed by equivalents using lexical &quot;dare&quot; where appropriate:
*&quot;If he dare try it, he may succeed.&quot; (&quot;If he dares to try it, he may succeed.&quot;)
*&quot;If he dared try it, he might succeed.&quot; (&quot;If he dared to try it, he might succeed.&quot;)
*&quot;Dare he do it?&quot; (&quot;Does he dare to do it?&quot;)
*&quot;Dared he do it?&quot; (&quot;Did he dare to do it?&quot;)
*&quot;I daren&#x27;t (or dare not&quot;) &quot;try.&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t dare to try.&quot;)
*&quot;I dared not try.&quot; (&quot;I didn&#x27;t dare to try.&quot;)
*&quot;How dare you!&quot; (formulaic expression of outrage)
*&quot;I dare say&quot; (or &quot;daresay&quot;) &quot;it&#x27;s true&quot;. (Another formulaic expression, here exceptionally in an affirmative context, unexpected for an NPI)

However, its affirmative context causes *&quot;He dared speak up&quot; to be ungrammatical.

Although seemingly obsolete in the 21st century, &quot;daredn&#x27;t&quot; was in use in the early 20th:

*&quot;&quot;I daredn&#x27;t hurry,&quot; said Mr Colclough, setting us down at the station. &quot;I was afraid of a skid.&quot;&quot;
*&quot;One&#x27;s so safe with such a son to con her / Through all the noises and through all the press, / Boys daredn&#x27;t squirt tormenters on her dress.&quot;

&quot;Dared&quot; has supplanted an earlier preterite form, &quot;durst&quot;. Examples:
*&quot;The former [. . .] retired with cattle and other booty to their mountains, whither they knew well the Lowlanders durst not follow them.&quot;
*&quot;Other debts I durst not face.&quot;
*&quot;dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch&quot;

&quot;Durst&quot; had a negative inflected form, &quot;durstn&#x27;t&quot;. Examples:
*&quot;I&#x27;m under authority, you know, and durstn&#x27;t overstep&quot;
*&quot;the boat, where I durstn&#x27;t kick for fear of poking my feet through the bottom&quot;
*&quot;I durstn&#x27;t go home to tell Mother Pring&quot;

Lexical verb &quot;dare&quot; is close to an NPI: &quot;She dared to speak up&quot; is much less likely than &quot;She didn&#x27;t dare to speak up.&quot; And the lexical–modal distinction is blurred: &quot;lexical &quot;dare&quot; commonly occurs in non-affirmative contexts without &quot;to&quot;&quot;: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t dare ask her father&quot;; and it also can be stranded, as in &quot;She ought to have asked for a raise, but she didn&#x27;t dare&quot;.

Data from a corpus of American and British spoken and written English of the 1980s and 1990s show that &quot;dare&quot; (modal or lexical) is infrequent and &quot;is found chiefly in fiction and [British English] conversation&quot;. In negative constructions in American fiction, lexical &quot;dare&quot; is more common. In Britain, modal auxiliary &quot;dare&quot; is. Further, negation of preterite &quot;dared&quot; is rare. In both American and British English, interrogative constructions that require subject–auxiliary inversion show inversion of auxiliary &quot;dare&quot; much more commonly than &quot;do&quot;-support of lexical &quot;dare&quot;; however, many of the instances here of auxiliary &quot;dare&quot; are of fixed formulas (&quot;How dare you . . . ?&quot;, etc).

===&quot;Used&quot;===
Used is far more commonly encountered as a lexical than as an auxiliary verb, particularly for younger or American speakers. The plain form &quot;use&quot; (sometimes spelt ) of the lexical verb is seen in &quot;Did you use to play tennis?&quot;). Although rare, its preterite perfect &quot;had used&quot; is attested. The first of &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;s five criteria for modal auxiliary verbs is irrelevant to auxiliary verb &quot;used&quot;, which fails the last three. The auxiliary verb &quot;is also semantically quite distinct from the modal auxiliaries: the meaning it expresses is aspectual, not modal.&quot; &quot;The Cambridge Grammar&quot; does not class auxiliary &quot;used&quot; as a modal auxiliary verb.

For more about &quot;use&quot;, see English auxiliary verbs.

===Modal idioms with &quot;have&quot;===
The verb &quot;had&quot; in the expression had better lacks any untensed form (*&quot;Tomorrow you will have better concentrate&quot;; *&quot;I&#x27;ve had better work hard since I started&quot;; *&quot;We&#x27;re having better concentrate&quot;) and hence is sometimes classed as a modal idiom, a semi-modal, or an emerging or quasi-modal verb.

Negating &quot;had better&quot;, whether by &quot;had better not&quot; or by &quot;hadn&#x27;t better&quot;, normally negates the subordinate clause: it is internal (&quot;Youd better not stick around&quot;). However, as for any modal auxiliary, a negative interrogative (&quot;Hadn&#x27;t we better scarper before the police come?&quot;) negates the matrix clause.

Had best and had rather similarly lack any untensed form. &quot;Had best&quot; is much less common than &quot;had better&quot;. Since &quot;had rather&quot; and &quot;would rather&quot; are both likely to be realized as &quot;d rather&quot;, it is rarely easy to decide which of the pair is being used.

Hendrik Poutsma adds:

&quot;I had as lief&quot; (or &quot;lieve&quot;), although now antiquated and mostly replaced by &quot;I had as soon&quot;, has never fallen completely into disuse. . . . The shortening of &quot;had&quot; to &quot;d&quot; has given rise to &quot;would&quot; being sometimes substituted for it.

==Frequency of use==
During the second half of the 20th century, the frequencies of use of both the modal auxiliary verbs and of alternatives to them showed considerable change. A comparison of the frequencies in the British corpora LOB and FLOB (with material from 1961 and 1991 respectively), and of those in the American corpora Brown and Frown (1961 and 1992 material respectively) shows:

(Percentage changes shown in parentheses come with  values of greater than 0.05; they are of less statistical significance.)

A study of modal auxiliary verbs and quasi-modals in American, British and Australian examples (given equal weight) of a variety of genres of written and spoken English in the 1990s found that the totals were:

Commenting on a different but similar set of figures, &quot;Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English&quot; observes of &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;need&quot;, &quot;dare&quot;, and &quot;use&quot; :

In view of the considerable attention given to these marginal auxiliaries in grammatical descriptions of English and English language teaching materials, it is worth noting how rare they are, particularly in negative and interrogative auxiliary constructions.

== Deduction ==

In English, modal verbs as &quot;must, have, got&quot; and &quot;could/can&quot; are used to express deduction and contention. The modal verbs state how sure the speaker is about something.

*You&#x27;re shivering – you must be cold. 
*Someone must have taken the key: it is not here.
*I didn&#x27;t order ten books. This has to be a mistake. 
*These aren&#x27;t mine – they&#x27;ve got to be yours.
* It can&#x27;t be a burglar. All the doors and windows are locked.

==Modals at the head of chains==
The verb governed by the modal may be another auxiliary (necessarily one that can appear in plain form—this includes &quot;be&quot; and &quot;have&quot;, but not another modal, except in the non-standard cases described below under ). Hence, a modal may introduce a chain of verb forms in which the other auxiliaries express properties such as aspect and voice, as in &quot;He must have been given a new job&quot;. If infinitival &quot;to&quot; is regarded as an auxiliary verb, then longer chains are possible, as in &quot;He must have been encouraged to try to serve tea&quot;.

===Double modals===

In Standard English, since a modal auxiliary verb is followed by a verb in its plain form (which modals lack), it cannot be followed by a second modal auxiliary verb. &quot;Might have&quot; is grammatical (&quot;have&quot; is here the plain form of a non-modal verb), but *&quot;might must&quot; is not. 

However, what appear to be sequences of modal auxiliary verbs occur. &quot;Might could&quot;, &quot;must can&quot;, &quot;might oughta&quot;, &quot;might would&quot;, &quot;must could&quot;, &quot;could oughta&quot;, &quot;might should&quot;, &quot;may can&quot;, &quot;should oughta&quot;, &quot;might can&quot;, &quot;may could&quot;, &quot;would oughta&quot;, &quot;might will&quot;, &quot;may will&quot;, &quot;may should&quot; are some of the 76 combinations attested in Southern American English. Those with &quot;might&quot; as the first modal are easily the most common, and &quot;might could&quot; is the most common of them all. Longer sequences such as &quot;might should oughta&quot; are also attested. In Britain, by contrast, the most common is &quot;would might&quot; although commonness is relative: double modal auxiliary verbs &quot;occur only rarely in spontaneous speech, even in varieties in which they are known to be used&quot;.

The syntactic status of sequences such as &quot;might could&quot; and &quot;would might&quot; is unclear. One possibility is that &quot;might&quot; has been reanalysed by the speaker as an English adverbs and thus be functioning as an adjunct.

Two rules from different grammatical models supposedly disallow the construction. Phrase structure grammar sees the surface clause as allowing only one modal verb, and main verb analysis dictates that modal verbs occur in finite forms.

==Comparison with other Germanic languages==
Many English modals have cognates in other Germanic languages, if often with different meanings. Unlike the English modals, however, such verbs are not generally defective:
* In German: ; cognates of &quot;may&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, and &quot;will&quot;. Although German shares five modal verbs with English, their meanings are often quite different. does not mean &quot;be allowed&quot; but &quot;may&quot; as epistemic modal and &quot;like&quot; as a normal verb followed by a noun phrase. It can be followed by an infinitive with the meaning of &quot;have a desire (to do something)&quot;. means &quot;will&quot; only in the sense of &quot;want (to do something)&quot; and is not used for future reference, for which is used instead. , and are used similarly to English &quot;must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, and &quot;shall&quot;. The negation of is a literal one in German, not an inverse one as in English&quot;: German (&quot;I must&quot;) means &quot;I need (to do something)&quot;, and (literally &quot;I must not&quot;) accordingly means &quot;I don&#x27;t need (to do something)&quot;. In English, &quot;have (to do something)&quot; behaves the same way, whereas English &quot;must&quot; expresses an interdiction when negated. (need) is sometimes used like a modal verb, especially negated ( &quot;He need not come.&quot;).
* In Dutch: ; cognates of &quot;may&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, and &quot;will&quot;.
* In Danish: , cognates of &quot;may/must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;. They generally have the same meanings as in English, with the exception of , which usually means &quot;want (to do something)&quot; (but can also mean &quot;will&quot;).
* In Swedish: (past tense: ), , cognates of &quot;may/might&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;. Their meanings generally correspond to those in English with the exception of , which means &quot;want (to do something)&quot;.

Since modal verbs in other Germanic languages are not defective, the problem of &quot;double modals&quot; (see above) does not arise: the second modal verb in such a construction simply takes the infinitive form like for any verb in the same position. Compare the following translations of English &quot;I want to be able to dance&quot;, all of which translate literally as &quot;I want can dance&quot; (except the German, as &quot;I want dance can&quot;):

<doc id="1178384" wikidata="Q560570" url="?curid=1178384" title="Modal verb">
<text>A modal verb is a type of verb that contextually indicates a modality such as a &quot;likelihood&quot;, &quot;ability&quot;, &quot;permission&quot;, &quot;request&quot;, &quot;capacity&quot;, &quot;suggestion&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;obligation&quot;, &quot;necessity&quot;, &quot;possibility&quot; or &quot;advice&quot;. Modal verbs generally accompany the base (infinitive) form of another verb having semantic content. In English, the modal verbs commonly used are &quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, and &quot;ought&quot;.

==Function==
Modal verbs have a wide variety of communicative functions, but these functions can generally be related to a scale ranging from possibility (&quot;may&quot;) to necessity (&quot;must&quot;), in terms of one of the following types of modality: 
*epistemic modality, concerned with the theoretical &quot;possibility of propositions being true or not true&quot; (including likelihood and certainty)
*deontic modality, concerned with &quot;possibility and necessity in terms of freedom to act&quot; (including permission and duty)
*dynamic modality, which may be distinguished from deontic modality in that, with dynamic modality, the conditioning factors are &quot;internal&quot; – the subject&#x27;s own ability or willingness to act

The following sentences illustrate epistemic and deontic uses of the English modal verb &quot;must&quot;:
*epistemic: &quot;You must be starving.&quot; (&quot;I think it is almost a certainty that you are starving.&quot;)
*deontic: &quot;You must leave now.&quot; (&quot;You are required to leave now.&quot;)
An ambiguous case is &quot;You must speak Spanish.&quot; The primary meaning would be the deontic meaning (&quot;You are required to speak Spanish.&quot;) but this may be intended epistemically (&quot;It is surely the case that you speak Spanish&quot;).
Epistemic modals can be analyzed as raising verbs, while deontic modals can be analyzed as control verbs.

Epistemic usages of modals tend to develop from deontic usages. For example, the inferred certainty sense of English &quot;must&quot; developed after the strong obligation sense; the probabilistic sense of &quot;should&quot; developed after the weak obligation sense; and the possibility senses of &quot;may&quot; and &quot;can&quot; developed later than the permission or ability sense. Two typical sequences of evolution of modal meanings are:
*internal mental ability → internal ability → root possibility (internal or external ability) → permission and epistemic possibility
*obligation → probability

== English ==

The following table lists English modal verbs and various senses in which they are used:

==In other languages==
===Hawaiian Pidgin===

Hawaiian Pidgin is a creole language most of whose vocabulary, but not grammar, is drawn from English. As is generally the case with creole languages, it is an isolating language and modality is typically indicated by the use of invariant pre-verbal auxiliaries. The invariance of the modal auxiliaries to person, number, and tense makes them analogous to modal auxiliaries in English. However, as in most creoles the main verbs are also invariant; the auxiliaries are distinguished by their use in combination with (followed by) a main verb.

There are various preverbal modal auxiliaries: &quot;Kaen&quot; &quot;can&quot;, &quot;laik&quot; &quot;want to&quot;, &quot;gata&quot; &quot;have got to&quot;, &quot;haeftu&quot; &quot;have to&quot;, &quot;baeta&quot; &quot;had better&quot;, &quot;sapostu&quot; &quot;am/is/are supposed to&quot;. Unlike in Germanic languages, tense markers are used, albeit infrequently, before modals: &quot;Gon kaen kam&quot; &quot;is going to be able to come&quot;. &quot;Waz&quot; &quot;was&quot; can indicate past tense before the future/volitional marker &quot;gon&quot; and the modal &quot;sapostu&quot;: &quot;Ai waz gon lift weits&quot; &quot;I was gonna lift weights&quot;; &quot;Ai waz sapostu go&quot; &quot;I was supposed to go&quot;.

===Hawaiian===

Hawaiian, like the Polynesian languages generally, is an isolating language, so its verbal grammar exclusively relies on unconjugated verbs. Thus, as with creoles, there is no real distinction between modal auxiliaries and lexically modal main verbs that are followed by another main verb. Hawaiian has an imperative indicated by &quot;e&quot; + verb (or in the negative by &quot;mai&quot; + verb). Some examples of the treatment of modality are as follows: &quot;Pono&quot; conveys obligation/necessity as in &quot;He pono i nā kamali&#x27;i a pau e maka&#x27;ala&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s right for children all to beware&quot;, &quot;All children should/must beware&quot;; ability is conveyed by &quot;hiki&quot; as in &quot;Ua hiki i keia kamali&#x27;i ke heluhelu&quot; &quot;Has enabled to this child to read&quot;, &quot;This child can read&quot;.

===French===

French, like some other Romance languages, does not have a grammatically distinct class of modal auxiliary verbs and expresses modality using lexical verbs followed by infinitives: for example, &quot;pouvoir&quot; &quot;to be able&quot; (&quot;Je peux aller&quot;, &quot;I can go&quot;), &quot;devoir&quot; &quot;to have an obligation&quot; (&quot;Je dois aller&quot;, &quot;I must go&quot;), and &quot;vouloir&quot; &quot;to want&quot; (&quot;Je veux aller&quot; &quot;I want to go&quot;).

===Italian===

Modal verbs in Italian form a distinct class (&quot;verbi modali&quot; or &quot;verbi servili&quot;). They can be easily recognized by the fact that they are the only group of verbs that does not have a fixed auxiliary verb for forming the perfect, but they can inherit it from the verb they accompany – Italian can have two different auxiliary verbs for forming the perfect, &quot;avere&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;), and &quot;essere&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;). There are in total four modal verbs in Italian: &quot;potere&quot; (&quot;can&quot;), &quot;volere&quot; (&quot;want&quot;), &quot;dovere&quot; (&quot;must&quot;), &quot;sapere&quot; (&quot;to be able to&quot;). Modal verbs in Italian are the only group of verbs allowed to follow this particular behavior. When they do not accompany other verbs, they all use &quot;avere&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) as a helping verb for forming the perfect.

For example, the helping verb for the perfect of &quot;potere&quot; (&quot;can&quot;) is &quot;avere&quot; (&quot;have&quot;), as in &quot;ho potuto&quot; (lit. &quot;I-have been-able&quot;,&quot;I could&quot;); nevertheless, when used together with a verb that has as auxiliary &quot;essere&quot; (&quot;be&quot;), &quot;potere&quot; inherits the auxiliary of the second verb. For example: ho visitato il castello&quot; (lit. &quot;I-have visited the castle&quot;) / ho potuto visitare il castello&quot; (lit. &quot;I-have been-able to-visit the castle&quot;,&quot;I could visit the castle&quot;); but sono scappato&quot; (lit. &quot;I-am escaped&quot;, &quot;I have escaped&quot;) / sono potuto scappare&quot; (lit. &quot;I-am been-able to-escape&quot;, &quot;I could escape&quot;).

Note that, like in other Romance languages, there is no distinction between an infinitive and a bare infinitive in Italian, hence modal verbs are not the only group of verbs that accompanies an infinitive (where in English instead there would be the form with &quot;to&quot; – see for example &quot;Ho preferito scappare&quot; (&quot;I have preferred to escape&quot;). Thus, while in English a modal verb can be easily recognized by the sole presence of a bare infinitive, there is no easy way to distinguish the four traditional Italian modal verbs from other verbs, except the fact that the former are the only verbs that do not have a fixed auxiliary verb for the perfect. For this reason some grammars consider also the verbs &quot;osare&quot; (&quot;to dare to&quot;), &quot;preferire&quot; (&quot;to prefer to&quot;), &quot;desiderare&quot; (&quot;to desire to&quot;), &quot;solere&quot; (&quot;to use to&quot;) as modal verbs, despite these always use &quot;avere&quot; as auxiliary verb for the perfect.

===Mandarin Chinese===

Mandarin Chinese is an isolating language without inflections. As in English, modality can be indicated either lexically, with main verbs such as &quot;yào&quot; &quot;want&quot; followed by another main verb, or with auxiliary verbs. In Mandarin the auxiliary verbs have six properties that distinguish them from main verbs:

*They must co-occur with a verb (or an understood verb).
*They cannot be accompanied by aspect markers.
*They cannot be modified by intensifiers such as &quot;very&quot;.
*They cannot be nominalized (used in phrases meaning, for example, &quot;one who can&quot;)
*They cannot occur before the subject.
*They cannot take a direct object.

The complete list of modal auxiliary verbs consists of
*three meaning &quot;should&quot;,
*four meaning &quot;be able to&quot;,
*two meaning &quot;have permission to&quot;,
*one meaning &quot;dare&quot;,
*one meaning &quot;be willing to&quot;,
*four meaning &quot;must&quot; or &quot;ought to&quot;, and
*one meaning &quot;will&quot; or &quot;know how to&quot;.

===Spanish===
Spanish, like French, uses fully conjugated verbs followed by infinitives. For example, &quot;poder&quot; &quot;to be able&quot; (&quot;Puedo andar&quot;, &quot;I can walk&quot;), &quot;deber&quot; &quot;to have an obligation&quot; (&quot;Debo andar&quot;, &quot;I must walk&quot;), and &quot;querer&quot; &quot;to want&quot; (&quot;Quiero andar&quot; &quot;I want to walk&quot;).

The correct use of &quot;andar&quot; in these examples would be reflexive. &quot;Puedo andar&quot; means &quot;I can walk&quot;, &quot;Puedo irme&quot; means &quot;I can leave&quot; or &quot;I can take myself off/away&quot;. The same applies to the other examples.

<doc id="1178401" wikidata="Q8038977" url="?curid=1178401" title="Wu Teh Yao">
<text>Wu Teh Yao (, 1915–17 April 1994) was a Chinese political scientist. He was an educator and a specialist in Confucianism and political science.

==Education==
Wu completed his senior school certificate at the Anglo-Chinese School in Penang at the age of seventeen. He was accepted into the Chung Ling High School, a well-known bilingual institution teaching in both Chinese and English, despite not knowing any Chinese, after an interview with the principal David Chen. After his graduation from Chung Ling in 1936, he was admitted to Nanking University (now known as Nanjing University) for a course of a Bachelor of Arts programs under Chen&#x27;s recommendation. He later obtained a Master of Arts degree from Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, and a doctoral degree in political science from Harvard University in 1946.

He was an active athlete during his secondary school years. Furthermore, he represented Malayan Chinese at the National Sports Carnival, Shanghai, China, during the inter-war years.

==Career==
===Academia===
Wu joined the United Nations after obtaining his doctorate and participated in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1951, he co-authored the Fenn-Wu Report on the Chinese education system in Malaysia.

He was President of Tunghai University in Taiwan between 1957 and 1971. From then until 1975 he was the head of the Political Science Department, University of Singapore. He was a Professor and the Dean of the College of Graduate Studies of Nanyang University from 1975 to 1980, and was acting vice-chancellor from 1976 to 1977. When Nanyang University and University of Singapore merged in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore, he was appointed Professor of Political Science. He retired in 1981.

===Offices===
Professor Wu was a founding director of the Institute of East Asian Philosophies, which was established by Goh Keng Swee in 1983 in the interest of studying Confucianism.

==Retirement and death==
After his retirement, Professor Wu, a modest person, lived in an HDB apartment in Jurong East, Singapore, and used taxis as his main form of transportation. He died on 17 April 1994 in Taipei, Taiwan, and a memorial service was held for him at the Presbyterian Church in Orchard Road, Singapore. A memorial lecture series was started in his name the following year, with the inaugural lecture delivered by the Confucian scholar Tu Weiming.

<text>Wang Gungwu, (; born 9 October 1930) is an Australian historian, sinologist, and writer specialising in the history of China and Southeast Asia. He has studied and written about the Chinese diaspora, but he has objected to the use of the word &quot;diaspora&quot; to describe the migration of Chinese from China because both it mistakenly implies that all overseas Chinese are the same and has been used to perpetuate fears of a &quot;Chinese threat&quot;, under the control of the Chinese government. An expert on the Chinese tianxia (&quot;all under heaven&quot;) concept, he was the first to suggest its application to the contemporary world as an American Tianxia.

==Background==
Wang was born in Surabaya, Indonesia to ethnic Chinese parents from Taizhou, Jiangsu and grew up in Ipoh, Malaysia. He completed his secondary education in Anderson School, an English medium school in Ipoh. Wang studied history in the University of Malaya, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. He was a founding member of the University Socialist Club and its founding president in 1953.

He holds a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (1957) for his thesis &quot;The structure of power in North China during the Five Dynasties&quot;. He taught at the University of Malaya (in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur). He was one of the founders of the Malaysian political party Gerakan, but he was not personally directly involved in the party&#x27;s activities.

In 1965, he chaired a Committee to review the curriculum of Nanyang University. The Committee reported in May 1965. Meanwhile, in August 1965, Singapore separated from the Federation of Malaysia as an independent republic. In September 1965, the committee was released and the university accepted the recommendations, triggering students protests, petitions, and boycotts of classes and examinations.

In 1968 he went to Canberra to become Professor of Far Eastern History in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS) at the Australian National University. He took a turn as Director of RSPAS, 1975–80. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong from 1986 to 1995. In 2007, Wang became the third person to be named University Professor by the National University of Singapore.

In 1994, Wang was awarded the Academic Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize by the Japanese city of Fukuoka. On 12 June 2009, he was one of ten eminent persons to receive an honorary degree to celebrate Cambridge University&#x27;s 800th anniversary; he was awarded a Doctor of Letters (&quot;honoris causa&quot;). In 2020 Wang was awarded the Tang Prize in Sinology. He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order (Singapore) in August 2020.

Wang is a naturalized Australian after 18 years of teaching in Australia, yet he does not consider himself Australian because &quot;both his understanding of Australia and the understanding of Australians about him had been superficial&quot;.

==Recent awards and accomplishments==
The 2020 Tang Prize in Sinology was awarded to Professor Wang Gungwu by the Tang Prize Foundation. According to the National University of Singapore, Professor Wang, who is &quot;one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts on the Chinese diaspora&quot;, was granted the prestigious award &quot;in recognition of his trailblazing and dissecting insights on the history of the Chinese world order, overseas Chinese, and Chinese migratory experience&quot;. The Straits Times reported that the Tang Prize Foundation praised his &quot;unique approach to understanding China by scrutinising its long and complex relation with its southern neighbours&quot;. The organisation, which is based in Taiwan, mentioned that his work has &quot;significantly enriched the explanation of the Chinese people&#x27;s changing place in the world, traditionally developed from an internalist perspective or relation to the West&quot;. Professor Chen Kuo-tung of Taiwan&#x27;s top think-tank Academia Sinica, highlighting the significance of Professor Wang Gungwu&#x27;s works that merited the award, said that &quot;Professor Wang&#x27;s research filled a gap in Sinology, which is the study of Chinese overseas&quot;.

In April 2021, Wang Gungwu was granted the Distinguished Service Order in Singapore. Professor Wang, who was also the founding Chairman of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at NUS and the former Chairman of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and East Asian Institute (EAI), was acknowledged for his important capacity in &quot;developing world-class research institutions in Singapore&quot;. The award also recognised his publication of &quot;pioneering works on the history of China, South-east Asia, and East Asia, as well as the Chinese diaspora in South-east Asia and Singapore, providing invaluable insights for policymakers&quot;.

In July 2022, Wang was conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters (Litt.D.) by NUS. As an NUS alumnus, Wang was lauded for &quot;his dedication to Sinology, his remarkable intellect, his trailblazing vision, and his public contributions&quot;. The honorary doctorate celebrates the long-standing contributions and value that Wang&#x27;s scholarly insights bring to Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the world.

At age 91, Wang became one of the oldest people to win the Singapore Literature Prize, the other being literary pioneer Suratman Markasan. His memoir Home Is Where We Are, topped the English creative non-fiction category in 2022.

== Positions held ==
Wang is a University Professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and also Chairman of the Managing Board of the NUS&#x27;s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He was the Director (1997-2006) and Chairman (2006-19) of the East Asian Institute in Singapore. Wang was a Distinguished Professorial Fellow at the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute where he was chairman of the board of Trustees from 1 November 2002 to 31 October 2019. He is also a Professor Emeritus of the Australian National University and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, elected in 1970 and serving as president from 1980 to 1983.

Wang was also Chairman of International Advisory Council in Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman.

<text>Lake Koshkonong is a reservoir in southern Wisconsin, which was transformed from its original marshland by the construction of the Indianford Dam in 1932. The lake lies along the Rock River, with the river acting as both the primary inflow and the primary outflow for the lake. Lake Koshkonong begins downriver from Fort Atkinson, with the large majority of the lake located in southwestern Jefferson County. Small portions of the lake extend into southeastern Dane and northern Rock counties.

After the creation of the Indianford Dam, which was built several miles down the Rock River from Lake Koshkonong, the lake gained a surface area measuring . It remains very shallow with an average depth of and a maximum depth of . The dam itself measures high and with a length of at its crest. Maximum capacity of the reservoir is . Both dam and reservoir are owned and operated by Rock County.

==History and etymology==
The currently accepted spelling &quot;Koshkonong&quot; was first used by Doty in 1844. An often repeated claim that has been recently disputed is that the meaning of the name is &quot;the lake that we live on.&quot; A more accurate approximation may be &quot;where there is heavy fog,&quot; or &quot;where it is closed in by fog.&quot; Current thinking suggests that the modern spelling is a contraction of various names given to the region by white settlers in the early 19th century. They incorporated various pronunciations of the region from various surrounding tribes, including &quot;Kashkawanung&quot; from the Ojibwe, &quot;Coscahoenah&quot; from the Menomini, and &quot;Kuskouonog&quot; from the Potowatomi. This theory is supported by the fact that these name forms seem to share Algonquian language patterns, despite describing a Winnebago (Siouan) village. More evidence disputing the older name translation is that the name seems to have described a Winnebago village on the shores of the lake, with the name being extended to the body of water at a later date.

This spelling of the lake&#x27;s name gained legitimacy after surveying efforts in the area codified this interpretation in the 1830s and 40&#x27;s. Fort Koshkonong, a fort of some importance to the United States during the Black Hawk War, was named in accordance with this convention. The fort was active before the Rock River was dammed, when the area was a cattail marsh with the Rock River running through the middle. Today, the lake borders the Town of Koshkonong on its eastern side, and the Town of Sumner on its northern side.

==Ecology==
=== Vegetation ===
Lake Koshkonong has seen many vegetational changes in the past 150 years. Once a deep-water marsh covered with emergent vegetation, the lake was predominantly wetlands filled with reeds, wild rice, and grasses. The wetlands have significantly disappeared since then due to rising water levels caused by higher dams and the ever changing landscape. It is estimated to have lost over 100 acres of wetland by 2000. Now, the large pool of water known as Lake Koshkonong has been replaced by lake sedge (Carex lacustris), bur-reed (Sparganium), and other aquatic species. The lake association has been trying to introduce Pondweed and Wild celery to improve fish habitats.

=== Fish ===
Throughout the Rock River (Mississippi River tributary) and Lake Koshkonong around sixty species of fish can be found. Many of those species are river spawners, meaning the release of gametes from the body occurs in the rivers even though they might spend their whole life in lakes. Floods and droughts will both affect spawning of different species of fish, enhancing the amount of some and depleting others. Here are a few species of fish that can be found in the lake. Muskellunge, Panfish, Largemouth bass, Smallmouth bass, Northern pike, Walleye, and Catfish.

=== Birds ===
In the surrounding habitats of Lake Koshkonong&#x27;s riparian wetlands, many endangered species of birds can be found. The rising water levels have an unfortunate impact on these species. Loss of trees, herbaceous vegetation, and groundwater dependent wetland plants will effect the species they support. Some of the rare species found in this area that are impacted by rising water levels and habitat loss are the Cerulean warbler and the Acadian flycatcher. Other rare species of birds that are being affected are Black tern, Forster&#x27;s tern, American bittern, Least bittern, and Virginia rail.

==Tourism and recreation==
=== Summer attractions ===
Lake Koshkonong is well known for its great fishing seasons. Hook and line fishing is open all year round with restrictions on some species including Muskellunge, Lake Sturgeon, Trout, Paddlefish, and other endangered species. Muskellunge and Hybrid season for 2020 was open May 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020 with a minimum length limit of 40 inches and a daily bag limit of 1. For fishing to be able to occur on the lake it has to be stocked by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources at the Bark River Hatchery in Fort Atkinson with Walleye and Northern pike. There are four boat landings around the lake for people to use and also two beaches. The Lake is very shallow averaging around 6 feet with a maximum depth of 7 feet, but you can still boat, canoe, and kayak here.

Events hosted on the lake range from boat races to Venetian Boat Parades. Thunder on the Lake is a high speed boat race that has been held on Lake Koshkonong. The boats are hydroplane powered and can reach speeds up to 60 MPH. Other boat races are also held for fishing boats, and other smaller boats. The Venetian Boat Parade is put on by the Rock Koshkonong Business Association. Participants are encouraged to dress up their boat with lights and decorations of their choosing and cruise along with one another ending at the Lakeview bar.

=== Winter attractions ===
Ice fishing and ice racing used to be much more common, but due to warmer weather in the past few years the activity has not been as popular. Other winter activities practiced on and around the lake include snowmobiling, fatbike riding, and ice skating.

==Environmental concerns==
=== Erosion ===
The loss of aquatic plant biodiversity and rising water levels on the lake due to flooding has caused significant erosion over the past 50 years. The shoreline has been impacted greatly by such events, and projects to reverse and prevent more damage from occurring have been done. Riprap armor has been used to prevent future erosion, but it is mostly a short term fix where human made rock formations are placed along the shoreline to protect against scour and waves. In 2002 and 2003 the Rock Koshkonong Lake District (RKLD) teamed up with wetland owners to protect around 40% or almost 5 miles of the shoreline with riprap armor. Incorporating breakwater structures has also been talked about as a potential fix to the erosion problem.

=== Water quality ===
Lake koshkonong is known for its tinted green color which is caused by algae and nutrient runoff from the Rock River. The lake is classified as hypereutrophic because it is extremely rich in nutrients and the water is shallow. The transparency of the water is low and algal blooms occur frequently, causing this classification. A lake will be classified as hypereutophic if it has more than 40 micrograms/liter of chlorophyll, more than 100 micrograms/liter of phosphorus, and a visibility depth of less than 3 feet. The Trophic State Index scale also helps with these classifications. If a lake scores a TSI of above 50 it will be considered hypereutrophic. Lake Koshkonong has a TSI score of 67. Algal blooms can result in high levels of blue-green algae which can be harmful to humans and pets under certain circumstances. Blue-green algae has been found in parts of Lake Koshkonong. It is advised by the Rock County Public Health Department to not swim in areas with floating green scum, and blue or white paint looking areas that resemble pea soup.

===Proposed nuclear power plant===
In the 1970s, Lake Koshkonong was the primary site considered for a billion dollar nuclear power station. Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Power and Light Company, Madison Gas and Electric, and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation jointly proposed the project. They chose Lake Koshkonong out of 84 potential sites because of the solid rock found here that could be used for the foundation, and the Rock River could be used as an adequate water source. In 1974, it was estimated that the utilities would lose $40 million if the two-unit, 900 MW each, facility was not approved. At that time, the timetable had already slipped to a 1983/1984 commissioning. The proposed two pressurized-water reactor system had hopes of beginning construction in 1978.

The plan was met with strong resistance from environmental groups. It was eventually killed in 1977 by concerns regarding the lake&#x27;s shallow depth and consequences to the plant during drought conditions. Water would have been exiting the lake to cool down the plant, and residents were uneasy about that along with other aspects of the project. The power plant was intended to relocate many residents and disrupt farmland as well. It was estimated that the disruption to farmland would cost farmers a total of $27,500 each year for lost crops.

The Koshkonong Alert Group was an anti-nuclear group that formed in opposition of the power plant.

Attempts were made to salvage the $40 million investment by moving the facility to Haven, Wisconsin, near Sheboygan, but state utilities gave up on their plans for construction of a nuclear station in Wisconsin following the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania. The plant was planned to be built on Vickerman Road, east of the lake and east of Wisconsin Highway 26.()

<doc id="1178418" wikidata="Q5317582" url="?curid=1178418" title="Duty of fair representation">
<text>The duty of fair representation is incumbent upon Canadian and U.S. labor unions that are the exclusive bargaining representative of workers in a particular group. It is the obligation to represent all employees fairly, in good faith, and without discrimination.

Originally recognized by the United States Supreme Court in a series of cases in the mid-1940s involving racial discrimination by railway workers&#x27; unions covered by the Railway Labor Act, the duty of fair representation also applies to workers covered by the National Labor Relations Act and, depending on the terms of the statute, to public sector workers covered by state and local laws regulating labor relations.

The term as used in Canada applied to 7 out of 10 provinces and in federal law .

== History ==
The concept of a DFR originated in the 1940s in the American case, &quot;Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad&quot; and was formalized as a legal test in &quot;Vaca v. Sipes&quot; (1967). The doctrine was first mentioned in Canada with the Woods Task Force Report. The first Canadian case to establish a DFR was &quot;Fisher v. Pemberton&quot; (1969) which cited &quot;Vaca v. Sipes.&quot; A DFR wasn&#x27;t enacted in statute in Canada until amendments to the &quot;Labour Relations Act&quot; of Ontario were added in 1971, followed by British Columbia in 1973.

== Application in Canada ==
Findings of a violation of the DFR against a union are relatively rare in Canada, as the courts have interpreted it not as duty to provide &quot;good&quot; representation but as a duty to not provide bad or discriminatory representation. Nevertheless, DFR complaints are upheld in cases where the union has made decisions that are &quot;arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or wrongful&quot;.

==Application in the United States==
The duty applies to virtually every action that a union might take in dealing with an employer as the representative of employees, from its negotiation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, to its handling of grievances arising under that agreement, as well as its operation of an exclusive hiring hall and its enforcement of the union security provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. However, the duty does not ordinarily apply to rights that a worker can enforce independently; the union has no duty to assist the employees it represents in filing claims under a workers&#x27; compensation statute or other laws.

The duty likewise does not apply for the most part to unions&#x27; internal affairs, such as their right to discipline employees for violation of the union&#x27;s own rules or union officers&#x27; handling of union funds, which are regulated instead by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. The courts have, on the other hand, applied the same principles that govern the duty of fair representation to union members&#x27; suits to enforce union constitutions.

=== Courts&#x27; view ===
Generally the courts have taken a deferential approach to reviewing unions&#x27; decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers at the expense of others, the courts have held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions&#x27; decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.

=== New applications ===
In recent years the courts and the National Labor Relations Board have applied the duty of fair representation to regulate the manner in which unions enforce the union security provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike the standard applied to unions&#x27; decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of expenses that a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the accounting procedures used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union&#x27;s calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.

The NLRB applies a similarly strict standard in reviewing unions&#x27; enforcement of exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the employer is bound, by contract, to hire only employees referred to it by the union. The NLRB requires unions to establish clear procedures and to follow those procedures in order to minimize the likelihood that the union would use a hiring hall procedure to exclude non-members or those out of favour with the union from the workplace. On the other hand, the NLRB applies the more deferential standard applied to union decisions generally in the case of non-exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the union has the power to refer applicants for employment but the employer may also hire employees &quot;off the street&quot;; in those cases the union is barred from acting arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily.

=== Violations ===
The NLRB recognizes a breach of the duty of fair representation as a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. However, because the duty of fair representation was originally created by judicial interpretation, rather than as an express statutory prohibition, employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act may sue their unions directly, without being required to first exhaust any administrative procedures provided under the National Labor Relations Board. The same is true for workers covered by the Railway Labor Act, which does not provide any administrative procedure for pursuing claims against a union. Employees&#x27; claims under either Act are governed by a six-month statute of limitations.

The NLRB and the courts provide different solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce the collective bargaining agreement or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys&#x27; fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.

A union may, in some limited circumstances, require employees to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union&#x27;s constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their rights under the grievance arbitration procedures provided for under the collective bargaining agreement before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.

<text>Insurance fraud is any intentional act committed to deceive or mislead an insurance company during the application or claims process, or the wrongful denial of a legitimate claim by an insurance company. It occurs when a claimant knowingly attempts to obtain a benefit or advantage they are not entitled to receive, or when an insurer knowingly denies a benefit or advantage that is due to the insured. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, the most common schemes include premium diversion, fee churning, asset diversion, and workers compensation fraud. False insurance claims are insurance claims filed with the fraudulent intention towards an insurance provider.

Fraudulent claims account for a significant portion of all claims received by insurers, and cost billions of dollars annually. Insurance fraud poses a significant problem, and governments and other organizations try to deter such activity.

Studies suggest that the greatest total dollar amount of fraud is committed by the health insurance companies themselves, intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems, and denying and cancelling coverage.

== History ==
Insurance fraud has existed since the beginning of insurance as a commercial enterprise.

Long before the rise of the modern insurance industry, an epigram by the Roman poet Martial, set in the Roman Empire during the first century AD, illustrates how crimes such as arson might be motivated by profit:

: &quot;Tongilianus, you paid two hundred [&quot;denarii&quot;] for your house;
: An accident too common in this city destroyed it.
: You collected ten times more. Doesn&#x27;t it seem, I pray,
: That you set fire to your own house, Tongilianus?&quot;&lt;br&gt; 

==Causes==
The &quot;chief motive in all insurance crimes is financial profit&quot;. Insurance contracts provide both the insured and the insurer with opportunities for exploitation.

According to the American Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, the causes vary, but are usually centered on greed, and on holes in the protections against fraud. Those who commit insurance fraud may view it as a low-risk, lucrative enterprise as compared to other forms of criminal activity.

==Financial impact==
As insurance fraud may not be detected, it is difficult to accurately estimate its total cost to society. Among organizations that have estimated its cost, the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud estimates that in 2006 a total of about $80 billion was lost in the United States due to insurance fraud. The Insurance Information Institute, insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insurance industry&#x27;s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that 3% of the health care industry&#x27;s expenditures in the United States are due to fraudulent activities, amounting to a cost of about $51 billion. According to the FBI, non-health insurance fraud costs an estimated $40 billion per year, which increases the premiums for the average U.S. family between $400 and $700 annually.

Another study of all types of fraud committed in the United States insurance institutions (property-and-casualty, business liability, healthcare, social security, etc.) estimates the cost at 33% to 38% of the total cash flow through the system. This study resulted in the book title &quot;The Trillion Dollar Insurance Crook&quot; by J.E. Smith. In the United Kingdom, the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in the United Kingdom is about £1.5 billion ($3.08 billion), causing a 5% increase in insurance premiums. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that personal injury fraud in Canada costs about C$500 million annually. Indiaforensic Center of Studies estimates that Insurance frauds in India costs about $6.25 billion annually.

==Types of insurance fraud==

Insurance fraud can be classified as either hard fraud or soft fraud.

Hard fraud occurs when someone deliberately plans or invents a loss, such as a collision, auto theft, or fire that is covered by their insurance policy in order to claim payment for damages. Criminal rings are sometimes involved in hard fraud schemes that can steal millions of dollars.

Soft fraud, which is more common than hard fraud, is sometimes also referred to as opportunistic fraud. This type of fraud consists of policyholders exaggerating otherwise legitimate claims. For example, when involved in an automotive collision an insured person might claim more damage than actually occurred. Soft fraud can also occur when, while obtaining a new health insurance policy, an individual misreports previous or existing conditions to obtain a lower premium on the insurance policy.

===Automobile insurance===
Automobile insurance fraud occurs when somebody intentionally seeks benefits from an insurance company that they know that they are not legitimately entitled to receive.

The UK Insurance Research Council estimated that in 1996, 21 to 36 percent of auto-insurance claims contained elements of suspected fraud.

Schemes used to defraud automobile insurance providers differ greatly in complexity and severity, and include both individual and organized efforts.

====Staged collisions====
Fraud rings or groups may fake traffic deaths or stage collisions to make false insurance or exaggerated claims and collect insurance money. The fraud may involve the engineering of a deliberate collision with the innocent driver of another vehicle. Some fraud rings involve insurance claims adjusters who authorize payment on the claims. In the UK, the Association of Chief Police Officers estimated that 30,000 auto accidents were staged in 2009. Insurance fraud may also include such actions as a pedestrian jumping in front of a car, then seeking compensation for claimed injuries.

Staged collision schemes may involve fraud at three different levels. At the top, there are lawyers who file fraudulent claims, supported by doctors who fabricate or exaggerate diagnoses and treatment records. Next are the &quot;cappers&quot; or &quot;runners&quot;, the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. At the bottom are the participants recruited to risk injury in the staged accidents. These rings may involve organized crime.

====Exaggerated claims====

After a motor vehicle collision, a vehicle owner may attempt to make a claim for coverage beyond the scope of what was caused by the accident, for example by seeking coverage for preexisting damage. Physical injuries may also be exaggerated by a driver or other person claiming injury in a collision.

====False reports of theft====
Insurance fraud occurs when an insured party falsely report their vehicle as stolen.

====Rate evasion====
In rate evasion, a vehicle owner registers a vehicle to a location where the insurer offers lower rates as compared to where they actually reside.

Another form of fraud, known as &quot;fronting&quot;, involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of the car in order to obtain a lower rate. For example, parents might list themselves as the primary driver of their children&#x27;s vehicles to avoid young driver premiums.

===Health insurance===
Health insurance fraud involves an intentional act of deceiving, concealing, or misrepresenting information that results in health care benefits being paid to an individual or group, or being wrongfully denied to a person entitled to receive benefits. Fraud can be committed either by an insured person or by a provider.

Member fraud consists of such acts as the making of claims on behalf of ineligible members or their dependents, making false statements on enrollment forms, concealing preexisting conditions that could affect the scope of coverage or cost of the policy, and failure to disclose claims that were a result of a work-related injury in violation of the terms of a health insurance policy.

Provider fraud consists of claims submitted by medical care providers, and may include billing for services not rendered, billing for higher level of services than those provided, making false statements on claims submissions, double-billing by doctors who charge more than once for the same service, performance of unnecessary medical treatments or surgery, and billing for services other than those actually rendered. Providers may also bill for care actually provided to their patients, but which is not medically necessary. Practices that may be used to perpetrate fraud include &quot;up-coding&quot; or &quot;upgrading&quot;, which involve billing for more expensive treatments than those actually provided; &quot;phantom billing&quot;, billing for services not rendered; and &quot;ganging&quot;, billing for services to family members or other individuals who are accompanying the patient but who did not personally receive any services.

Health insurance fraud depletes the resources of taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare. Public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are especially conducive to fraudulent activities, as they are often run on a fee-for-service structure.

It is estimated that in the U.S., as of 2017, $262 billion in healthcare claims are initially denied, and health systems spend approximately $20 billion each year trying to secure payment for valid health insurance claims that were wrongly denied, including some claims that were preapproved by the insurance company. Forms of fraud by health insurance companies include the wrongful denial of claims, wrongful cancellation of coverage, and underpayment of hospitals and physicians.

When detected, health insurance fraud can result in civil liability as well as criminal penalties, and potential action against a healthcare provider&#x27;s license.

===Life insurance===
The majority of life insurance fraud occurs at the application stage, involving applicants misrepresenting their health, their income, and other personal information in order to get a cheaper premium. As more and more insurance amendments can be performed online or over the telephone, identity theft has become an enabling crime that can lead to the amendment of life insurance terms to benefit a fraudster; for example, by adding a second stolen identity as a new beneficiary.

Life insurance fraud may involve faking death to claim life insurance. Fraudsters may sometimes turn up a few years after disappearing, claiming a loss of memory. For example, in the case of John Darwin, a former teacher and prison office turned up alive five years after he was purported to have died in a canoeing accident, after his family had made a successful claim on his life insurance. Similarly, former British Government minister John Stonehouse reportedly missing in 1974 from a beach in Miami after the acquisition of multiple life insurance policies, but was discovered living under an assumed name in Australia.

=== Premium fraud ===
Insurers can lose premium income when customers provide false or misleading information about risk, causing a lower premium to be charged. This can happen with any type of insurable risk. For example, when applying for workers compensation insurance, an employer may report fewer employees, a lower total payroll, and less risk of employee negligence or injury than actually exists, obtaining coverage at a lower cost than would result from accurate disclosure.

===Property insurance===
Property insurance fraud includes obtaining payment that exceeds the value of the repair or replacement of insured property, or the intentional infliction of damage or destruction of insured property for the purpose of making an insurance claim. The most common forms of property insurance fraud are re-framing a non-insured damage to make it an event covered by insurance, and inflating the value of the loss.

Property insurance crimes often involve arson, as evidence that a fire was intentionally started may be destroyed by the fire itself. According to the United States Fire Administration, in the United States there were approximately 31,000 fires caused by arson in 2006, resulting in losses of $755 million.

Another form for fraud is over-insurance, in which someone insures property for more than its real value. This condition can be difficult to avoid, especially since an insurance provider might sometimes encourage it to obtain greater profits.

=== Unemployment insurance ===
Unemployment insurance fraud can be perpetrated by both employers and employees. Employer fraud involves efforts to avoid payment of unemployment taxes, or the creation of a false business entity through which fraudulent employee claims are submitted. Employee fraud occurs when somebody seeks benefits to which they are not entitled, for example, when someone who is not unemployed or who steals the identity of another individual in order to claim that other person&#x27;s benefits.

During the pandemic in 2020, there was a significant spike of unemployment fraud in the United States.

==Detection==
Due to the high volume of insurance claims made across the industry, it is not possible for insurance companies to review all claims for fraud.

The detection of insurance fraud usually begins with the identification of suspicious claims, those that have a higher possibility of being fraudulent. This may be accomplished with computerized statistical analysis that compares data about a claim to expected values, or through review by claims adjusters or insurance agents. Sometimes insurance fraud is detected as a result of law enforcement investigation, or tips from members of the public. Any claim that is identified as suspect may then be investigated for possible fraud.

===Statistical analysis===

Statistical analysis may involve supervised and unsupervised machine learning. For a supervised approach, expected values are obtained by analyzing records of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims. To be accurate in its evaluation of claims, it is necessary that the claims analyzed when training the model are accurately identified as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

For unsupervised statistical detection, the goal is to detect claims that are abnormal as compared to other claims, and to have the algorithm identify &quot;red flag&quot; factors that are associated with past fraudulent claims.Viaene, Stijn, et al. &quot;Insurance Claim Fraud Detection.&quot; p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; This process is not intended to prove that a given claim is fraudulent, but instead to efficiently identify claims that should be subjected to further review.

Fraudulent claims can be one of may be identified as &quot;built up&quot;, meaning that they are legitimate claims that are exaggerated in their value, or they may be false claims for damages that never occurred. For built up claims, insurance companies usually try to negotiate the claim down to an appropriate amount.\

===Fraud investigators===

Suspicious claims may be submitted to the insurance company&#x27;s fraud investigators, who work for divisions that may be called &quot;special investigative units&quot; or SIUs. Fraud investigators look for signs or evidence that a claim is false or fraudulent and, should such evidence be found, the insurance company can use the finding to deny payment of the claim or refer the matter to law enforcement for possible criminal prosecution.

When an insurance company&#x27;s fraud department investigates a fraud claim, they frequently proceed in two stages: pre-contact and post-contact. The pre-contact stage occurs prior to contact with the claimant, and involves collection and analysis of all available documentation and evidence pertaining to the claim, potentially including the taking of witness statements or collection of evidence from third-party sources. Then, in the &quot;post-contact&quot; stage, they interview the claimant to gather more information and, when possible, an admission that the claim is fraudulent. The goal of the investigation and interview is to verify the value of the claim and, should fraud be identified, collect evidence of the insured party&#x27;s intent to defraud. or the intention to defraud, An interview with the insured may also be used to challenge subsequent changes to the insured&#x27;s narrative.

==Worldwide==
National and local governments, especially in the last half of the twentieth century, have recognized insurance fraud as a serious crime, and have made efforts to punish and prevent this practice.

===Canada===

In British Columbia, any person who submits a motor vehicle insurance claim that contains false or misleading information may be fined, imprisoned, or both.

The Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1973 to help fight insurance fraud. This organization collects information on insurance fraud, and also carries out investigations. Approximately one third of these investigations result in criminal conviction, one third result in denial of the claim, and one third result in payment of the claim.

===United Kingdom===
The UK has broad, general criminal provisions that make fraud punishable as a crime, The Fraud Act of 2006 specifically defines fraud as a crime, committed when a person &quot;makes a false representation&quot;, &quot;fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose&quot;, or abuses a position in which a person is &quot;expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person&quot;.

The Serious Fraud Office was established by the government in 1987 to improve the investigation and prosecution of serious and complex fraud cases. The City of London Police runs an Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, that specializes in tracking criminals who knowingly commit insurance fraud.

Part 4 of the Insurance Act 2015 codifies the common law principle that an insurer is not obligated to pay a fraudulent claim, and may recover payments already made from the insured should fraud later be discovered. Upon proper notice to the insured, the insurer may also treat the insurance contract as if it was terminated at the time of the &quot;fraudulent act&quot;. Neither &quot;fraud&quot; nor &quot;fraudulent claim&quot; is defined in the legislation. In an important legal judgment in this area, the Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that false information being used to support a genuine claim for loss did not in itself make the claim fraudulent, and so the forfeiture rules did not apply. The majority ruling in the Supreme Court differed from the findings of the trial court and the Appeal Court, which had seen the false information as a &quot;reckless misrepresentation&quot; and maintained a public policy interest against use of false claim information.

===United States===

Insurance fraud may be proseucuted as a crime in all states, whether under general fraud statutes or those that specifically pertain to insurance claims and coverage. The federal government has passed a statute that criminalizes the act of defrauding a health care benefit plan, Section 1347 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

<doc id="1178429" wikidata="Q1407637" url="?curid=1178429" title="Ferrari 275">
<text>The Ferrari 275 is a series of front-engined V12-powered grand touring automobiles with two-seater coupé and spider bodies produced by Ferrari between 1964 and 1968. The first 275 series cars were powered by a 3.3 L (3286 cc) overhead camshaft Colombo 60° V12 engine producing . An updated 275 GTB/4 was introduced in 1966, with a revised four overhead camshaft engine producing . The 275 series were the first road-going Ferraris equipped with a transaxle and independent rear suspension.

Pininfarina designed the 275 coupé and spider bodies, while Scaglietti designed the 275 GTS/4 NART Spyder, of which only 10 were made.

&quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; named the 275 GTB coupé/GTS spider as number three in their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;, and the 275 GTB/4 was named number seven on &quot;Sports Car International&#x27;s&quot; 2004 list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s. In a September 1967 road test, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; described the NART Spyder as &quot;the most satisfying sports car in the world.&quot;

==Two-cam models==
All 275 coupé and spider models built from 1964 until the 275 GTB/4&#x27;s introduction in 1966 were equipped with an overhead cam 3.3 litre V-12 engine (one camshaft for each cylinder bank). These early models are often called &quot;two-cam&quot; cars to distinguish them from later 275 models.

===275 GTB===
The 275 GTB was a two-seat grand touring coupé produced between 1964 and 1966. The name of this model was derived from the engine&#x27;s per-cylinder displacement of 275 cc and the Italian designation &quot;Gran Turismo Berlinetta&quot;.

The 275 GTB used a double overhead cam 3.3 litre Colombo-designed 60º V-12 engine designated &quot;Tipo 213&quot;. This engine was the final development of the Colombo V12, with a stroke of 58.8 mm and a bore of 77 mm. The internal parts of the engine were derived from those used in other Ferrari models including the 250 GTE 2+2, 250 Lusso and 250 GTO. Three twin-choke Weber 40 DCZ 6 or 40 DFI 1 carburetors were equipped as standard. Power was claimed to be at 7600 rpm, but provided closer to 240- in actual use. A factory option of six twin-choke Weber 40 DCN carburetors was also available, which Ferrari claimed provided at 7500 rpm although the actual increase in power over the three-Weber setup was likely only 20-25 hp. The rear wheels were driven by a 5-speed manual transaxle with Porsche-style synchromesh and a limited-slip differential. This was the first time a transaxle was used on a Ferrari production road car, although they were used on some earlier Ferrari competition models such as the 250 Testa Rossa.

The 275 chassis was a conventional ladder frame design fabricated from oval-section steel tube. Mike Parkes had a major role in developing the 275&#x27;s suspension, which employed many technologies tested in earlier Ferrari racing cars such as the 250 TR and 250 LM. Double wishbone independent suspension was used at all four wheels along with Koni shock absorbers and coil springs. The 275&#x27;s four-wheel independent suspension was a first for Ferrari road cars, which were previously equipped with live rear axles. Dunlop disc brakes were equipped at all four wheels, although even during the mid 1960s they were considered inadequate due to small size, lack of ventilated discs, and an underpowered servo and caliper. Cast magnesium 14 inch diameter wheels were standard equipment, with Borrani wire wheels available as a factory option, both wheel options came fitted with Pirelli 205VR14 Cinturato CN72 tyres. 

The 275 engine was initially mounted to the chassis at four points, each insulated by a thin rubber pad in road cars or an aluminium spacer in competition versions. The transaxle was similarly mounted to the rear of the chassis at three points. Engine and transaxle were connected via a rigid drive shaft, supported by a central bearing. This mounting arrangement allowed the engine and transaxle to act as stressed members of the chassis. This improved overall rigidity, but caused increased noise and vibration and required careful alignment. At the end of 1965, the driveshaft was revised with the addition of CV joints at either end, which allowed some flexibility and misalignment between the engine and transmission. This system was retrofitted to some earlier production cars and was also installed in some early 1966 production series two &quot;long nose&quot; cars prior to the introduction of the torque tube.

The coupé body was designed by Pininfarina and manufactured by Scaglietti. The standard 275 GTB body was fabricated in steel with aluminium alloy doors, hood and trunk lid. At least 72 cars were built with a lightweight all-aluminium body, which was an extra-cost option from the factory.

A series two, or &quot;long-nose&quot; version of the 275 GTB was introduced in 1966. The second series 275 GTB incorporated a number of mechanical and cosmetic changes. A torque tube was installed between the engine and transaxle in order to relieve stress on the drive shaft and central support bearing. The engine and transaxle were revised to use two chassis attachment points each, rather than the four engine mounts and three transaxle mounts used on earlier cars. As a result, the engine and transaxle were now a rigid unit, flexibly suspended within the chassis by a total of four points. As the engine/transaxle were no longer stressed members, the chassis was slightly softer and noise/vibration issues seen on series I cars were improved. The front bodywork was lowered and lengthened and the front air intake was reduced in size, which improved aerodynamic characteristics and reduced high-speed instability. This was the most visible change between the two series, resulting in the common informal designation of series I cars as &quot;short nose&quot; and series II as &quot;long nose.&quot; The rear window was enlarged to improve visibility. In order to improve luggage space, the fuel filler, fuel tanks and spare tyre were relocated and the trunk hinges were changed from internal to externally-mounted.

A total of 442 of the 275 GTB road cars were produced between fall 1964 and summer 1966, including 236 Series I &quot;short-nose&quot; and 206 Series II &quot;long-nose&quot; cars.

=== Competition versions ===
From 1964 to 1966, Ferrari developed competition versions of the 275 GTB for use in Grand Touring-class sports car racing. Initial development of a 275 GTB-based racing car was motivated by a specific set of circumstances around Ferrari&#x27;s racing activities during 1964. The 1962–1963 250 GTO was extremely successful in GT-class racing but was nearing obsolescence in 1964. The 250 GTO&#x27;s planned successor, the 250 LM, was introduced to the public in November 1963, but the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) refused to homologate it for GT-class racing. In response, Ferrari decided to prepare for the 1964 season by developing in parallel both an updated 250 GTO (called the series II or GTO64) and a competition version of the 275 GTB. Between 1964 and 1966, Ferrari created three distinct series of 275 GTB-based competition cars, the purpose-built 1964/65 275 GTB Competizione Speciale (also known as the 275 GTB/C Speciale), a 1965 group of modified production 275 GTB &quot;customer competition&quot; cars for independent racing teams, and the final development, the purpose-built 1966 275 GTB/C.

==== 275 GTB Competizione Speciale ====
The first racing version of the 275 was the 275 GTB Competizione Speciale (or 275 GTB/C Speciale). Designed under the supervision of Mauro Forghieri, this model was intended to succeed the 250 GTO as Ferrari&#x27;s GT-class entry during the 1965 racing season. Ferrari constructed four cars of this type, three of which were manufactured between late 1964 and early 1965, while the fourth was completed in 1966. These cars were equipped with &quot;Tipo 213&quot; engines tuned to 250 LM specification, producing approximately 290-. The extra-thin-gauge alloy bodywork (designed by Pininfarina and built by Scaglietti) was significantly different from the production 275 GTB, with a more streamlined shape similar to the 250 GTO and the 330 LMB. All four cars had slightly differing hand-built bodywork, possibly due to ongoing aerodynamic experimentation by Ferrari engineers. The chassis was a lightweight version of the production &quot;Tipo 563&quot; chassis using smaller diameter tubing. Additional weight reduction was accomplished by drilling holes in interior panels, Plexiglas windows, and the use of magnesium castings for parts of the engine and transaxle. The owner of one 275 GTB/C Speciale (chassis 6885) estimated the curb weight as approximately .

The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) at first refused to homologate the model for the GT class but settled on a compromise when Enzo Ferrari threatened to abandon competing in the GT class. Due to this delay, only one 275 GTB/C Speciale (chassis 6885) raced during the 1965 season. This car competed at the 1965 Targa Florio, where was driven by Bruno Deserti and Giampiero Biscaldi but failed to finish. The car placed 13th overall at the 1965 1000km Nürburgring, driven by Biscaldi and Giancarlo Baghetti. It finished 3rd overall at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it was driven by Willy Mairesse and Jean Blaton (under the name &quot;Beurlys&quot;) for Ecurie Francorchamps. Following Le Mans, the car placed 11th overall at the 1965 500 km of Bridgehampton and won the 1965 Nassau Tourist Trophy.

Due to its role as a 250 GTO successor and its visual similarities with that model, the 275 GTB/C Speciale is sometimes referred to as the &quot;GTO &#x27;65&quot;, although this was never an official factory designation.

A 1964 275 GTB/C Speciale (chassis 06701) was sold in 2014 by RM Sotheby&#x27;s at their California auction for $26,400,000.

==== 275 GTB customer competition cars ====
Following the creation of the 275 GTB/C Speciale and the subsequent homologation struggles, Ferrari decided to create a less-radical competition 275 GTB to be sold to private racing teams. Ten cars of this type were produced. These customer competition (or in Italian &quot;competizione clienti&quot;) cars were very similar to the production 275 GTB, differing only in the alloy bodywork, extra venting, added exterior fuel fillers and expanded capacity fuel tanks. The engine was a &quot;Tipo 213&quot; unit with 6 carburetors, the same as fitted to production road-going 275 GTBs. These customer-competition 275 GTBs were created both to test the market for this type of GT racing car and as a gesture of compliance to the FIA, in hope of positively influencing the homologation process.

==== 275 GTB/C ====


For the 1966 season, Ferrari built a new series of 12 lightweight 275 GTB/C racing cars. Even though they outwardly resembled the road-going 275 GTB, the 275 GTB/C was thoroughly revised by Mauro Forghieri and his Scuderia Ferrari engineering team and differed from both the 275 GTB production car and earlier 275 GTB competition cars. Every panel of the body was altered and substantial mechanical changes were made. All 12 were constructed in 1966 between the end of the 275 GTB (two cam) production run and the start of the 275 GTB/4 (four cam) production run.

Forghieri designed a special super-lightweight steel and aluminium version of the 275 GTB chassis, designated &quot;Tipo 590 A&quot;. The 4-wheel independent suspension was the same design as on the production 275 GTB, but used different shock absorber valving and stiffer springs. The disc brakes were also the same as those used on the production 275 GTB, but with quick-change racing brake pads.

The body appeared superficially very similar to that of the production 275 GTB series II &quot;long nose&quot;, but in fact was a completely new lightweight version constructed by Scaglietti. All body panels were changed, including wider front and rear fenders and a slightly shorter nose. The body was constructed from thick aluminium panels joined with rivets. This method of construction allowed easy replacement of body panels after an accident. The body panels were approximately half as thick as the ones used on the 250 GTO and the Shelby Cobra. This made the body lightweight but extremely fragile—even leaning on a 275 GTB/C would dent it. The entire rear section was reinforced by fiberglass to prevent it from flexing at the slightest impact. The 275 GTB/C was equipped with bumpers visually similar to those on the road version, but they were made of much thinner material. The rear bumper lacked an internal supporting subframe and was simply fastened to the bodywork sheetmetal. Other weight-saving measures included removal of cooling fans, holes drilled in many internal panels and frames, plexiglass side and rear windows, thin fiberglass floor panels, and magnesium-framed seats. A 275 GTB/C fully equipped with fluids, spare tyre and tool kit weighs . In race trim without spare and tool kit, it can weigh less than , a savings of over compared to the alloy bodied road cars.

Similar to the four &#x27;Competizione Speciales&#x27;, the 275 GTB/C was powered by a &quot;Tipo&quot; &quot;213&quot; V12 tuned to 250 LM specification with a special crankshaft, piston, camshaft connecting rods and sodium-filled Nimonic valves. Many engine castings were made from the lightweight magnesium alloy Elektron. Due to an apparent clerical error, Ferrari did not report to the FIA that the production 275 GTB had a six carburetor option, so only a three carburetor engine could be homologated. In order to make up the loss of power from using only three carburetors, Weber constructed the 40 DF13 carburetor. These replaced the six Weber 38 DCN carburetors used on the 250 LM and were unique to the 275 GTB/C. A dry sump lubrication system was also added, allowing the engine to sit lower in the chassis. The &quot;Tipo&quot; 213 engine in this competition specification produced 275- at 7500 rpm.

The 275 GTB/C did not use the torque tube driveshaft configuration introduced with the 275 GTB series II, instead using a series I-style open driveshaft which made clutch changes easier during endurance races.The clutch itself was strengthened for the added stresses of racing. The transaxle was a similar design to the road version, but used a lightweight magnesium case, close ratio gears, a strengthened ZF limited slip differential and needle bearings (instead of plain bearings) between the gears and the main shaft.

The 275 GTB/C was fitted with specially-made Borrani wire wheels, sized 7&quot; x 15&quot; in front and 7.5&quot; x 15&quot; in the rear. These wheels were fitted with Dunlop&#x27;s latest &quot;M series&quot; racing tyres. It was this combination that would prove to be the weak spot of the 275 GTB/C; the tyres had so much grip that they could overstress and break the spokes on the wheels. This resulted in several crashes during competition. After the 275 GTB/C, no competition Ferrari would be fitted with wire wheels again. Two of the twelve 275 GTB/Cs built were sold for street use. Unlike the race cars, these street cars were fitted with standard 275 GTB-style alloy wheels with Pirelli tyres.

After its introduction in 1966, the 275 GTB/C was raced by several independent racing teams with varying degrees of Ferrari factory support, including NART, Maranello Concessionaires, Scuderia Filipinetti, and Ecurie Francorchamps. Three 275 GTB/Cs were entered in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, two of which finished. The Maranello Concessionaires-entered 275 GTB/C (chassis 09035) driven by Roy Pike and Piers Courage finished 8th overall and 1st in class, while the Ecurie Francorchamps 275 GTB/C (chassis 09027) driven by Claude Dubois and Pierre Noblet finished 10th overall and 2nd in class. Other notable victories include a 1st in class at the 1967 Targa Florio, driven by Tullio Sergio Marchesi. Marchesi went on to win the 1966 and 1967 Italian GT Championships driving 275 GTB/C chassis 09007.

===275 GTS===
The 275 GTS was a two-seat grand touring spider produced from 1964 to 1966. The 275 GTS was introduced at the same time as the 275 GTB and was mechanically almost identical, sharing the 3.3 litre V12, transaxle, chassis and fully independent suspension. Ferrari reported that the engine fitted to the 275 GTS produced . This was less than the reported 280 bhp produced by the 275 GTB, although there was likely no difference in engines between the models. The 275 GTS was never equipped with a torque tube, unlike the 275 GTB series II. This model was fitted with 205Vr15 Pirelli Cinturato CN72 tyres on Borrani wire wheels.

The all steel 275 GTS body was designed and manufactured by Pininfarina. Its appearance was entirely different than that of the 275 GTB coupé, with a shorter front hood, smaller uncovered headlights, and overall balanced proportions suggesting earlier 250 Pininfarina Cabriolet models. All 275 GTS were equipped with a folding cloth convertible top and an additional removable hard top was a factory option.

Ferrari produced a total of 200 275 GTS between late 1964 and early 1966, including 19 in right hand drive. The 275 GTS was replaced in 1966 by the 330 GTS, leaving no 3.3 L spider in the range until the creation of the 275 GTB/4 NART Spider.

==Four-cam models==
The 275 GTB/4 and GTS/4 NART spyder models made up the final production run of the 275 series, between 1966 and 1968. They were equipped with a four overhead cam 3.3 litre V-12 engine, a development of the double overhead cam 275 engine used from 1964–1966. The later 275 models are often called &quot;four-cam&quot; cars to distinguish them from earlier 275 models.

===275 GTB/4===
Introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 1966, the 275 GTB/4 (or 4-cam) used the same basic platform as the early 275 GTB with mostly mechanical improvements. The Scaglietti-built bodywork was largely the same as the series II &quot;long-nose&quot; 275 GTB, with the most visible difference being an added hood bulge with creased edges. Campagnolo magnesium alloy wheels sized 14x7 were standard equipment, while traditional Borrani wire wheels were a special-order option.

The engine was the &quot;Tipo 226&quot; 3285.72 cc &quot;Colombo&quot; V12, derived from the earlier &quot;Tipo 213&quot; 275 engine with two valves per cylinder, but now upgraded with four overhead camshafts and six Weber 40 DCN carburetors as standard. This engine produced a claimed . In a departure from previous Ferrari designs, the valve angle was reduced three degrees to 54° for a more-compact head. The dual camshafts also allowed the valves to be aligned perpendicular to the camshaft instead of offset as in SOHC engines. The engine used a dry-sump lubrication system with a large 17 qt (16 L) capacity.

Improvements from the series II 275 GTB were carried over to the 275 GTB/4, including the torque tube connecting the engine and transmission. In addition to the upgraded engine, the 275 GTB/4 had several minor improvements to the cooling system, exhaust and suspension.

The 275 GTB/4 had a claimed top speed of . A total of 330 were produced from 1966 to 1968.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the 275 GTB/4 number seven on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s.

===275 GTB/4S NART Spider===
The 275 GTB/4S NART Spider was a roadgoing two-seater spider version of the 275 GTB/4, 10 of which were built in 1967. Production of this car was initiated by Ferrari&#x27;s North American dealer, Luigi Chinetti, who wanted a successor to the earlier 250 California Spider series. He asked Sergio Scaglietti and Enzo Ferrari to build a spider version of the 275 GTB/4, which Chinetti bought for approximately $8,000 each, and listed at $14,400 retail. These cars were informally named NART Spiders, referring to Chinetti&#x27;s North American Racing Team. While the name &quot;NART&quot; was never part of this model&#x27;s official designation from the factory, a cloisonné badge with the team&#x27;s logo was installed on the rear of each car.

Chinetti intended to order 25 NART Spiders from Scaglietti, but because of low sales just 10 were built in 1967 and 1968, making this one of the rarest 275 models. The ten NART Spiders used chassis numbers 09437, 09751, 10139, 10219, 10249, 10453, 10691, 10709, 10749, and 11057. 

The magazine &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; published a road test of a then-new NART Spider in its September 1967 issue, describing it as &quot;the most satisfying sports car in the world.&quot; This test recorded a 0- time of 6.7 seconds, a drag strip time of 14.7 seconds. and a top speed of .

The first produced 275 GTB/4S (chassis 09437) was entered in the 1967 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Denise McCluggage and Marianne Rollo. They finished 17th overall, and 2nd in the 5-litre GT class. Following this race, the car was repainted from its original &quot;Giallo solare&quot; yellow to a burgundy colour for an appearance in the 1968 film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, where it was driven by Faye Dunaway&#x27;s character. The same car was subsequently tested by Road &amp; Track for their September 1967 road test article. In August 2005, 09437 sold for $3.96 million at Gooding &amp; Co.&#x27;s Pebble Beach auction.

In August 2013, a 1967 275 GTB/4S NART spider (chassis 10709) sold for (US$27.5m after commissions) at RM Sotheby&#x27;s Monterey, California auction. At the time of the auction, this was a one-owner car, previously owned by Eddie Smith of Lexington, North Carolina. Mr. Smith purchased it new in 1968 and drove it regularly until his death in 2007. Subsequently, the car remained in possession of his family until the 2013 auction sale. Mr. Smith Jr. felt that the car was &quot;sort of being imprisoned&quot; hence the reason for the selling it. The winning bid was by Lawrence Stroll, collector and part-owner of Aston Martin Formula One team. The Smith family announced that the proceeds of the sale will be donated to charity.

<doc id="1178436" wikidata="Q1266082" url="?curid=1178436" title="Alan Ford (comics)">
<text>Alan Ford is an Italian comic book created by Max Bunker (Luciano Secchi) and Magnus (Roberto Raviola), in print since 1969. The comic book is a satirical take on classic secret agents laden with surreal and black humour, and sardonic references to aspects of the contemporary Italian and Western society.

Although it became widely popular in Italy shortly after its introduction, Alan Ford remained relatively unknown outside Italy. The French, Danish and Brazilian editions soon failed but the only other foreign edition, in SFR Yugoslavia, was a huge success, becoming and remaining one of the most popular comic books in the former country and its successors.

Although the initial plot in the first few episodes develops around an agent called Alan Ford, he is later just one of the central group of characters: Group TNT is an assembly of misfit secret agents, who operate from a flower shop in New York City, United States, which they use as a front for their secret headquarters. They are incompetent and lazy, yet intelligent and cunning, especially when it suits their own personal interests. Their outlandish biographies are dwarfed by that of their iron-fisted and shrewd leader, Number One, a Methusalem character who embezzles the millions paid to the group by American government or city fathers for secret missions, while paying a pittance to his agents.

The comic book ridicules aspects of American society, including capitalism and racism. There were also direct references to local Italian reality, whose social ills were often satirized by Magnus &amp; Bunker, as well as terms in Milanese dialect.

==Editions==
Alan Ford is published monthly by Max Bunker Press in Italy. There are also editions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia (at least 4 different editions, ), Serbia and Slovenia. A Macedonian edition was also available for a while, and the Serbian editions are now imported into North Macedonia and Montenegro, still remaining hugely popular. The comic book has been adapted to animated film and theater plays, as well as used as a source of inspiration in books and movies.

== History ==
Three years before the comic book was published in May 1969, Max Bunker, along with illustrator Magnus, had the idea to create a satire of James Bond (they had previously created a serious spy character, Dennis Cobb). The initial script was written in August 1967 and the dialog revised in April 1968. The script included six main characters (Alan Ford, Bob Rock, Sir Oliver, The Boss, Jeremiah and Grunf), but the creators decided to omit Sir Oliver in the ultimate revision (July 1968), for fear of overwhelming readers with characters in the first issue. Raviola decided to base the drawing of Alan Ford on Irish actor Peter O&#x27;Toole.

According to Max Bunker, he wanted to create a comic book which did not fall into either of the then predefined categories of adventures and dark comics, like &quot;Satanik&quot; or &quot;Kriminal&quot; (both by Bunker and Raviola), or traditionally funny comics, like Mickey Mouse.

The first issue of the comic book, entitled &quot;Il Gruppo TNT&quot; (&quot;The Group TNT&quot;), was received mildly by its audience. The second issue, entitled &quot;The Hollow Tooth&quot; appeared in June 1968, introduced the Sir Oliver character, and was overshadowed by the first issue&#x27;s lack of success. The reputation of &quot;Alan Ford&quot; grew with subsequent issues.

The character of Number One was introduced later into the series, in the 11th issue named &quot;Number One&quot;. Cirano first appeared in the 18th issue (&quot;Million Dollar Dog&quot;), when he was adopted by Bob Rock, albeit unwillingly.

Magnus drew the first 75 issues, after which he was replaced by Paolo Piffarerio in 1975. In 1983, when the comic book moved to another publisher, Max Bunker Press, Raffaele della Monica and Giuliano Piccinnino replaced Piffarerio.

Currently the comic book is drawn by Dario Perucca (who also draws covers) with inks by Omar Pistolato. In its entire story the drawing style has remained the same set by Magnus.

==Translations==
&quot;Alan Ford&quot; was translated into French, Croatian, Danish, Portuguese and in the 1990s subsequent Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Macedonian and Slovenian editions appeared. The French and Macedonian editions only saw twelve issues before they got dropped due to poor sales. The Portuguese edition only saw about three issues. It was also translated into Albanian in Serbia which saw only five issues before getting dropped, also due to poor sales.

===Yugoslavia===

&quot;Alan Ford&quot; achieved great success in SFR Yugoslavia immediately after its 1972 introduction. It survived the dissolution of the country and in 2005 it was still one of the best selling comic books in the area.

The comic book&#x27;s publishing was started in 1972 by the state-owned company Vjesnik from Zagreb. This edition is still a popular collectors&#x27; item. First dozen issues didn&#x27;t produce much success, however, the appearance in issue #25 of antagonist Superciuk (translated as Superhik) &#x27;who steals from the poor and gives it to the rich&#x27; proved a hit with Yugoslav readership. Also, a lot of the comic book&#x27;s success in Yugoslavia is due to Nenad Brixy&#x27;s (born 1924 in Varaždinske Toplice) distinctive translation, rich in obscure, baroque-sounding Croatisms. A writer himself who penned several comedic novels about the clumsy detective character called Timothy Tacher, Brixy approached the job of translating &quot;Alan Ford&quot; in a free form and the resulting witty adaptation and imaginative text soon won him many admirers across the country.

Some of Vjesnik&#x27;s editions were occasionally censored by the publisher. For example, in issue #16, &quot;Don&#x27;t vote for Notax&quot;, a line making fun of American racism, reading &quot;Firstly, I promise that we will get rid of the Blacks. ... This is a country of the white race, and who doesn&#x27;t think that way will get punished...&quot; was changed to &quot;Firstly, I promise that we will get rid of &quot;our enemy&quot;. This is &quot;our&quot; country and who doesn&#x27;t think that way will...&quot; Certain pictures from the book were removed or repainted in some editions, while in some other editions those very same pictures appeared in original version.

There is a fake comic in circulation which features Yugoslav lifetime president Josip Broz Tito in a story line in one of the issues. Tito is portrayed as Number One&#x27;s old acquaintance who often engaged in shady activities. The entire issue was allegedly banned from publishing in Yugoslavia. The fake issue was published decades later after the country disintegrated. However, apart from decent drawing of fake characters, and borrowed dialogue from various issues, giveaway is the issue number (#39), which in fact is a comic called Belle Epoque.

Brixy died in 1984, marking in many ways the end of an era for &quot;Alan Ford&quot; in Yugoslavia. Even the comic book&#x27;s creator Max Bunker acknowledged Brixy&#x27;s contributions to its popularity in Yugoslavia, praising him as &quot;one of the rare translators who successfully depicted the black satire of the &quot;Alan Ford&quot; story and drawings&quot;. The edition continued after Brixy&#x27;s death, eventually ending in 1992 with the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars.

After the breakup of Yugoslavia, Borgis picked up the publishing rights for the Croatian market, keeping the original series title &quot;Alan Ford Superstrip&quot;. Maverick from Kraljevo initially started publishing for the Serbian market, and the comic was in 2003 picked up by Color Press Group from Novi Sad. In the 2000s, the original episodes in Brixy&#x27;s translation have been republished by Strip-agent in Croatia, under the title &quot;Alan Ford Klasik&quot;, again with great success and high circulation. Strip-agent is also publishing &quot;Alan Ford Extra&quot; (new Italian episodes), and &quot;Priče broja 1&quot; (Number One&#x27;s Stories).

In 1994 a play titled &quot;Alan Ford&quot; written by Mirjana Lazić and directed by Kokan Mladenović was staged at Teatar T in Belgrade. The play was an original story with most of the characters present, largely based on issue #30 (&quot;The Bearded Gang&quot;), but with numerous references to other episodes and characters. The play was performed in Croatian, as used by Brixy. In 2002 Radio Belgrade produced a radio drama based on the play.

In 2014 in Sarajevo, the Italian Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina organized the exhibition &quot;&quot;Alan Ford in Bosnia and Herzegovina: yesterday and today&quot;,&quot; as part of the &quot;Month of Italian Culture in Bosnia Herzegovina&quot; festival.

===France===
In France, the comic book debuted in 1975 published by &quot;Sagédition&quot; and lasted for only twelve issues. As Magnus became better known in France, this edition became a collectors&#x27; item.

In 2003, a small independent publisher, &quot;Taupinambour&quot;, started another edition with new issues.


===Brazil===
In Brazil, the comic book also debuted in 1975, published by &quot;Editora Vecchi&quot;, and only lasted for about five issues.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, Alan Ford was published in 1974 by Interpresse under the name Oskar Mortensen, and only lasted for six issues.

== Main characters ==

===Number One===

Number One (real name unknown) is the leader of the TNT. He uses a wheelchair, has a long beard and a bald scalp. Running gag in the series is his age: he claims to be alive well even from the Neanderthal era and to meet various characters from history, such as Nero, Homer and Maximilien Robespierre. He has a habit of telling stories of his past to his agents, who all fall asleep in the end, causing him to angrily wake them up by brandishing his stick.

He is a major underworld figure, well connected within the NYPD and the United States Army: he is known to have a black book which allegedly contains the secrets and past of every character he met in the comics, which he uses to blackmail them into obedience. His TNT group is used as a private agency for his contacts, and always requests large amounts of money for the job. He is extremely greedy and stingy: when Bob Rock requested the TNT&#x27;s motto to be &quot;All for one, one for all&quot;, he cleverly requested the letter O in the first word to be capitalized, leading to be &quot;All for One, one for all&quot;; in context, he gets to keep all the money for himself, while all TNT agents get only a single dollar for the mission. Despite having a huge personal wealth, he never spends any of it. He operates from a dilapidated flower shop in Brooklyn in which TNT agents reside, while his hideout is in a storage room in the New York subway, which is kept secret to all but TNT agents.

===Alan Ford===

Alan Ford is the central character of the series, a persiflage of James Bond. He is rather slim, with blonde hair and handsome features. He usually dresses in a black long-sleeved turtle neck, with black shoes and dark pants. He is the latest member of the group. He is shy, naive, and very meek and humble, But perhaps one of the most effective agents of the series. He develops certain skills during the course of the series and turns to be quite tough and responsive member of TNT. He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage, ran a one-man advertising agency and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined T.N.T by accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.

Running gag with Alan is his confusion and adaptability, intuitive personality, and in particular, his effect on encounters with women. His love interests turn out to either, use his gullible personality for their own agendas, genuinely love him but are criminals who end up being imprisoned, killed or on the run, or simply dislike his lack of success and lack of money. However, his bad luck with women turns for the better when he meets Minuette Macon. The two grow in love and Alan later marries her.

===Bob Rock===

Bob Rock is a senior member of TNT and Alan&#x27;s best friend. He is a self-insertion of the artist Magnus and a persiflage of Sherlock Holmes. He is very short and has an abnormally large nose, which is the butt of many jokes. Another running gag is his very short and nasty temper: he is easily angered and reacts violently when provoked, and often has to be restrained by Alan or Sir Oliver, with a particular weakness for jokes about his nose. He dresses in tartan clothing.

He descends from a family of criminals: his father died when he was a child, and his mother died from machine gun fire during a botched robbery attempt. He has three younger brothers, a set of triplets called Tim, Tom and Tumb, who are professional criminals and frequently try to use Bob as a scapegoat in their criminal schemes, and Bob frequently berates his brothers. He is mostly at odds with Number One for poor salaries and tyrannical attitude, and Number One often beats him with a crutch when provoked. Despite this, he is one of the group&#x27;s most trusted agents.

===Sir Oliver===

Sir Oliver of Olivers is an alleged English nobleman and a TNT member, a persiflage of Arsene Lupin. He is an avid kleptomaniac and fraudster: in every issue he is shown stealing. Due to his charming and witty personality, he is very successful in his field, always managing to steal anything, from range of cinema tickets, spare change, wallets, and even larger items and vehicles with success, although rarely gets to enjoy the loot because Number One is almost always onto him. Running gag is that, whenever he steals a large number of goods, he phones his never-seen fence Bing to sell him the goods (and asks about Bing&#x27;s brother, who is always in some kind of trouble). He wears a monocle, a bowler hat and stripped pants with a long coat, vest and a tie, maintaining a stoic, noble appearance, which helps him in his various schemes. He can be described as a gentleman thief.

He comes from a wealthy family of Olivers, and his father owned a large business venture that went bankrupt by the time of his death: he and his two brothers went to a life of crime and were very successful while maintaining a noble appearance in the public: however, after they went their own ways, both of his brothers died. He managed to keep his criminal enterprise secret while being tailed by the police until he was discovered. He was sentenced to life in prison, but he managed to switch seats with an American criminal due to be transferred, and then he freed himself during a flight by parachuting himself out. He landed in New York and he was discovered by Number One while he was trying to hustle a rich businessman, and was persuaded to join TNT. His lateral thinking, wittiness and ability to save himself quickly from the most complicated situations make him the most valuable agent of TNT, a trait that even Number One acknowledges.

===The Boss===

The Boss (real name Gervasius De Statuis, Gervasius Twinkleminkleson in the Croatian translation, also known as Big Boss) is Number One&#x27;s right-hand man and his second-in-command. Even though he is in charge of the flower shop while Number One is not around, in reality, he is a lazy, fat and aging TNT agent who tries his best to avoid work. He is at odds with Number One, who despises him for his laziness and inability to perform missions. He usually sleeps in the back of the flower shop, but occasionally joins the other TNT members on large-scale missions. After Bob, he is the most vocal about his salary, but is constantly rebuffed by Number One. His best friend is Jeremiah, but almost constantly bickers with him. He has a hamster named Squitty, and he is very devoted to him and protects him at all costs. He wears old ruptured pants, a bowler hat, a coat and a cardigan stripped shirt.

===Jeremiah===

Jeremiah is an aging member of the TNT. He is an Italian immigrant, and a running gag of the series is that he is an extreme hypochondriac who has many diseases or medical syndromes (and sometimes, he even has diseases he invented). He is bald and nearly toothless, and he sleeps around in the flower shop with The Boss. He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions. Another running gag is his ability to sleep through most extreme situations without waking up. He is a former street vendor and a hermit, which caused his bad health.

===Grunf===

Otto Grunf is a naturalized German-born inventor. He is a former Luftwaffe mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, fabricator and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines that end up in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting to start it or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), he is a very cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and is never at odds with him. His job is usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).

===The Great Caesar===

The Great Caesar is the head of the Los Angeles division of the TNT group. He is a former Chicago mobster who made his fortune during the Prohibition era. After Al Capone&#x27;s downfall, he became the most powerful mafioso in Chicago and held this position until his early retirement from business. He is independent from the New York division, but he still acts on Number One&#x27;s orders. He usually dresses in white or grey suits, smokes Cuban cigars, is completely bald and always wears his trademark sunglasses. He also runs a flower shop, which, in contrast to the New York one, is much larger and successful than its counterpart. He has his own crew of TNT agents, consisting of Tim, Tom and Tumb, Bob&#x27;s brothers, Professor Lamb, an inventor and former adversary of the TNT group, and Clodoveo, who remained for a while with him until he sent him back to Number One due to their constant quarrels. He enjoys fine wines, cigars, and he owns a panther, a bulldog and a gorilla, all tamed.

===Clodoveo===

Clodoveo is Number One&#x27;s parrot. He is a very intelligent parrot, being able to speak 18 languages and 117 dialects. He is Number One&#x27;s best friend and lives in his hideout with him, although the two constantly clash on most trivial subjects. He usually serves as the aviation in the TNT group and to carry messages from Number One to the TNT group or his allies when he is not around, and often ends up saving them in dangerous missions. He enjoys beef steaks and is a former alcoholic; his drinking habits are occasionally shown throughout the issues. He was absent throughout the part of the series due to his temporary relocation to Los Angeles when he lived with The Great Caesar; the two constantly clashed and both were relieved when Clodoveo returned to New York.

===Cirano===

Cirano is Bob Rock&#x27;s dog, who often participates in the group&#x27;s missions. He is a smart dog, though easily bribed with food. He was acquired by Bob very early in the issues, and even though the dog is officially his, the entire TNT group takes care of him, with mostly Alan, Bob or The Boss taking him for walks and/or feeding him. More than once, he was used by Sir Oliver for his various schemes. Running gag in the series is his frequent attempts to eat Squitty, only to be stopped and then violently assaulted by The Boss.

===Pellicus===

Pellicus is a pelican owned by Number One. He is rather large and is devoted to Number One, who saved him from being slaughtered. He used to be in the New York ZOO until he was evicted for being &quot;a nightmare&quot;. He loves eating fish and usually serves to transport Number One (and sometimes, the entire TNT group) across large areas (at one time, transporting Number One across the Atlantic Ocean). A running gag is his incredible strength and endurance for an ordinary pelican.

Many of the TNT Group members have disappeared from most recent issues, and the group currently consists of Alan, Minuette, Number One and Clodoveo, under the name &quot;Investigation agency T.N.T at low cost&quot;.

== Main enemies ==
* Superciuk (pronounced &quot;Superchook&quot;, meaning-wise communicating something like &quot;Superdrunk&quot;). Real name: Ezechiele Bluff, in Vjesnik version translated as &quot;Superhik&quot; and Milogled Bluff. Superciuk is the most prominent villain of the series, sometimes being the main subject of the plot. He steals from poor people and gives to rich, like an anti-Robin Hood of sorts. His main weapon is his deadly breath, alimented with poor quality Barbera and onion tomatoes; in Italian «chook» sounds like «ciucco», i.e. &quot;very drunk&quot;. In his normal life Superciuk is a street-sweeper who is constantly vexed by his companion, Beppa Giosef.
* Gommaflex was created for the television adaptation of the comic book. This character has a rubber face which can assume the lineaments of anybody, using this capability for criminal intents. His name is based on his powers, because &quot;Gomma&quot; means &quot;Rubber&quot; in Italian and &quot;Flex&quot; is intended as short for &quot;flexibility&quot;. He is, in a way, similar to the Spider-Man villain, Chameleon.
* Anten Man is perhaps inspired by Silvio Berlusconi when he was simply a TV and publishing industry man. He tries to achieve a monopoly in broadcasting by obscurating the transmissions of other companies. &quot;Anten&quot; refers to &quot;antenna&quot;.

Other enemies, whose names are normally puns in Italian, are Katodik, Mr. Tromb, the mobster boss &quot;Il Grande Cesare&quot;, Wurdalak the vampire (coming from the pages of &quot;Satanik&quot;), the scientist Aseptik, the quick-change Arsenico Lupon (pun of Arsène Lupin), the mobster families, the Mangia&#x27;s masonry, ghost gangster Baby Kate, masked Conspirator, magnate mr. Fitzgerald and witch Witchcraft.

== Animation ==
Alan Ford was also transposed in 1988 into a low-budget, straight-to-video 30 minutes animated short called &quot;Alan Ford e il Gruppo TNT contro SuperCiuk&quot; (&quot;Alan Ford and the TNT Group vs. SuperCiuk&quot;). It was produced by Max Bunker Press and was based on the SuperCiuk story already published in the comic series.

==In popular culture==
*Emir Kusturica&#x27;s 1998 movie &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; features a character (one of Dadan Karambolo&#x27;s gangster cronies) who reads an &quot;Alan Ford&quot; comicbook throughout the film. Furthermore, most of the transport contraptions used by another character in the movie are directly inspired by Grunf&#x27;s inventions.
*Prljavo Kazalište, a Croatian rock band was named after the translated line in Alan Ford&#x27;s issue called &quot;Broadway&quot;.
*Pero Defformero, a Serbian heavy metal band, was named after one of the characters.
* Popcycle, a Serbian britpop band, was initially called Gervasius Twinkleminkleson after the name of The Boss.
* Superhiks, a Macedonian rock band, was named after one of the villains in &quot;Alan Ford&quot;, Superciuk.
* In the song &quot;Za tebe&quot; by Croatian punk rock band KUD Idijoti, one of the verses is &quot;Kad srce radi bi-bam ba-bam&quot; (&quot;When a heart goes bi-bam ba-bam&quot;), the title of the 32nd issue of Alan Ford in Vjesnik&#x27;s translation. Another song by the same band is called &quot;Daj, daj, daj&quot;, the title of 5th issue of Alan Ford in Vjesnik&#x27;s translation.
* Pipi Kola, a Serbian experimental band, was named from one frame in which appears a character with sign &quot;Pipi Kola&quot; (number 87).
* Numerous lines and catchphrases from Alan Ford entered Croatian and Serbian slang. Number One, the name of an ageless terrible leader of TNT group, is sometimes used when jokingly referring to any old and crotchety person. Similarly, the name of main villain Superciuk (Superhik in Croatian) who has a notorious alcohol problem is sometimes used when joking about any drunkard, and Jeremija (Croatian name for Geremia) is often used for someone sickly or easily hurt. Sir Oliver&#x27;s entering line, which he used in almost every episode when he would call his pawnbroker Bing to sell him some stolen goods, &quot;Hello, Bing, how&#x27;s the brother?&quot;, also became a sort of catchphrase amongst numerous Alan Ford fans in Croatia and Serbia. Sir Oliver&#x27;s line &quot;Cijena, prava sitnica&quot; (Price? A bargain!) is now commonplace for &quot;it&#x27;s too expensive&quot;.
* 1980s Yugoslavian/Croatian software studio Suzy Soft made a game heavily inspired by Alan Ford character Superciuk. The game was called &quot;The Drinker&quot; and was available on ZX Spectrum and on Yugoslav-made Galaksija computer.
* One of the weapons in the game &quot;Serious Sam 2&quot;, created by the Croatian software house Croteam, is a bomb-carrying parrot named &quot;Clawdovic&quot; or &quot;Klodovik&quot;. Klodovik was also the name of the parrot Clodoveo in the Croatian editions of the comic book.
* The Department for Electronics of the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Electrical Engineering School website (tnt.etf.rs) is named after TNT Group.

<doc id="1178438" wikidata="Q1755722" url="?curid=1178438" title="Large eddy simulation">
<text>Large eddy simulation (LES) is a mathematical model for turbulence used in computational fluid dynamics. It was initially proposed in 1963 by Joseph Smagorinsky to simulate atmospheric air currents, and first explored by Deardorff (1970). LES is currently applied in a wide variety of engineering applications, including combustion, acoustics, and simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer.

The simulation of turbulent flows by numerically solving the Navier–Stokes equations requires resolving a very wide range of time and length scales, all of which affect the flow field. Such a resolution can be achieved with direct numerical simulation (DNS), but DNS is computationally expensive, and its cost prohibits simulation of practical engineering systems with complex geometry or flow configurations, such as turbulent jets, pumps, vehicles, and landing gear.

The principal idea behind LES is to reduce the computational cost by ignoring the smallest length scales, which are the most computationally expensive to resolve, via low-pass filtering of the Navier–Stokes equations. Such a low-pass filtering, which can be viewed as a time- and spatial-averaging, effectively removes small-scale information from the numerical solution. This information is not irrelevant, however, and its effect on the flow field must be modelled, a task which is an active area of research for problems in which small-scales can play an important role, such as near-wall flows, reacting flows, and multiphase flows.

== Filter definition and properties ==


An LES filter can be applied to a spatial and temporal field formula_1 and perform a spatial filtering operation, a temporal filtering operation, or both. The filtered field, denoted with a bar, is defined as:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the filter convolution kernel. This can also be written as:

:formula_4

The filter kernel formula_3 has an associated cutoff length scale formula_6 and cutoff time scale formula_7. Scales smaller than these are eliminated from formula_8. Using the above filter definition, any field formula_9 may be split up into a filtered and sub-filtered (denoted with a prime) portion, as

:formula_10

It is important to note that the large eddy simulation filtering operation does not satisfy the properties of a Reynolds operator.

== Filtered governing equations ==

The governing equations of LES are obtained by filtering the partial differential equations governing the flow field formula_11. There are differences between the incompressible and compressible LES governing equations, which lead to the definition of a new filtering operation.

=== Incompressible flow ===

For incompressible flow, the continuity equation and Navier–Stokes equations are filtered, yielding the filtered incompressible continuity equation,

:formula_12

and the filtered Navier–Stokes equations,

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the filtered pressure field and formula_15 is the rate-of-strain tensor evaluated using the filtered velocity. The nonlinear filtered advection term formula_16 is the chief cause of difficulty in LES modeling. It requires knowledge of the unfiltered velocity field, which is unknown, so it must be modeled. The analysis that follows illustrates the difficulty caused by the nonlinearity, namely, that it causes interaction between large and small scales, preventing separation of scales.

The filtered advection term can be split up, following Leonard (1975), as:

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the residual stress tensor, so that the filtered Navier-Stokes equations become

:formula_19

with the residual stress tensor formula_18 grouping all unclosed terms. Leonard decomposed this stress tensor as formula_21 and provided physical interpretations for each term. formula_22, the Leonard tensor, represents interactions among large scales, formula_23, the Reynolds stress-like term, represents interactions among the sub-filter scales (SFS), and formula_24, the Clark tensor, represents cross-scale interactions between large and small scales. Modeling the unclosed term formula_18 is the task of sub-grid scale (SGS) models. This is made challenging by the fact that the subgrid stress tensor formula_18 must account for interactions among all scales, including filtered scales with unfiltered scales.

The filtered governing equation for a passive scalar formula_9, such as mixture fraction or temperature, can be written as

:formula_28

where formula_29 is the diffusive flux of formula_9, and formula_31 is the sub-filter flux for the scalar formula_9. The filtered diffusive flux formula_33 is unclosed, unless a particular form is assumed for it, such as a gradient diffusion model formula_34. formula_31 is defined analogously to formula_18,

:formula_37

and can similarly be split up into contributions from interactions between various scales. This sub-filter flux also requires a sub-filter model.

====Derivation====
Using Einstein notation, the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in Cartesian coordinates are
: formula_38
: formula_39

Filtering the momentum equation results in
: formula_40

If we assume that filtering and differentiation commute, then
: formula_41

This equation models the changes in time of the filtered variables formula_42. Since the unfiltered variables formula_43 are not known, it is impossible to directly calculate formula_44. However, the quantity formula_45 is known. A substitution is made:
: formula_46

Let formula_47. The resulting set of equations are the LES equations:
:formula_48

=== Compressible governing equations ===

For the governing equations of compressible flow, each equation, starting with the conservation of mass, is filtered. This gives:

:formula_49

which results in an additional sub-filter term. However, it is desirable to avoid having to model the sub-filter scales of the mass conservation equation. For this reason, Favre proposed a density-weighted filtering operation, called Favre filtering, defined for an arbitrary quantity formula_9 as:

:formula_51

which, in the limit of incompressibility, becomes the normal filtering operation. This makes the conservation of mass equation:

:formula_52

This concept can then be extended to write the Favre-filtered momentum equation for compressible flow. Following Vreman:

:formula_53

where formula_54 is the shear stress tensor, given for a Newtonian fluid by:

:formula_55

and the term formula_56 represents a sub-filter viscous contribution from evaluating the viscosity formula_57 using the Favre-filtered temperature formula_58. The subgrid stress tensor for the Favre-filtered momentum field is given by

:formula_59

By analogy, the Leonard decomposition may also be written for the residual stress tensor for a filtered triple product formula_60. The triple product can be rewritten using the Favre filtering operator as formula_61, which is an unclosed term (it requires knowledge of the fields formula_9 and formula_63, when only the fields formula_64 and formula_65 are known). It can be broken up in a manner analogous to formula_16 above, which results in a sub-filter stress tensor formula_67. This sub-filter term can be split up into contributions from three types of interactions: the Leondard tensor formula_68, representing interactions among resolved scales; the Clark tensor formula_69, representing interactions between resolved and unresolved scales; and the Reynolds tensor formula_70, which represents interactions among unresolved scales.

=== Filtered kinetic energy equation ===

In addition to the filtered mass and momentum equations, filtering the kinetic energy equation can provide additional insight. The kinetic energy field can be filtered to yield the total filtered kinetic energy:

:formula_71

and the total filtered kinetic energy can be decomposed into two terms: the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field formula_72,

:formula_73

and the residual kinetic energy formula_74,

:formula_75

such that formula_76.

The conservation equation for formula_72 can be obtained by multiplying the filtered momentum transport equation by formula_78 to yield:

:formula_79

where formula_80 is the dissipation of kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field by viscous stress, and formula_81 represents the sub-filter scale (SFS) dissipation of kinetic energy.

The terms on the left-hand side represent transport, and the terms on the right-hand side are sink terms that dissipate kinetic energy.

The formula_82 SFS dissipation term is of particular interest, since it represents the transfer of energy from large resolved scales to small unresolved scales. On average, formula_82 transfers energy from large to small scales. However, instantaneously formula_82 can be positive &quot;or&quot; negative, meaning it can also act as a source term for formula_72, the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field. The transfer of energy from unresolved to resolved scales is called backscatter (and likewise the transfer of energy from resolved to unresolved scales is called forward-scatter).

== Numerical methods for LES ==

Large eddy simulation involves the solution to the discrete filtered governing equations using computational fluid dynamics. LES resolves scales from the domain size formula_86 down to the filter size formula_6, and as such a substantial portion of high wave number turbulent fluctuations must be resolved. This requires either high-order numerical schemes, or fine grid resolution if low-order numerical schemes are used. Chapter 13 of Pope addresses the question of how fine a grid resolution formula_88 is needed to resolve a filtered velocity field formula_89. Ghosal found that for low-order discretization schemes, such as those used in finite volume methods, the truncation error can be the same order as the subfilter scale contributions, unless the filter width formula_6 is considerably larger than the grid spacing formula_88. While even-order schemes have truncation error, they are non-dissipative, and because subfilter scale models are dissipative, even-order schemes will not affect the subfilter scale model contributions as strongly as dissipative schemes.

=== Filter implementation ===

The filtering operation in large eddy simulation can be implicit or explicit. Implicit filtering recognizes that the subfilter scale model will dissipate in the same manner as many numerical schemes. In this way, the grid, or the numerical discretization scheme, can be assumed to be the LES low-pass filter. While this takes full advantage of the grid resolution, and eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term, it is difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter that is associated with some numerical issues. Additionally, truncation error can also become an issue.

In explicit filtering, an LES filter is applied to the discretized Navier–Stokes equations, providing a well-defined filter shape and reducing the truncation error. However, explicit filtering requires a finer grid than implicit filtering, and the computational cost increases with formula_92. Chapter 8 of Sagaut (2006) covers LES numerics in greater detail.

== Boundary conditions of large eddy simulations ==
Inlet boundary conditions affect the accuracy of LES significantly, and the treatment of inlet conditions for LES is a complicated problem. Theoretically, a good boundary condition for LES should contain the following features:

(1) providing accurate information of flow characteristics, i.e. velocity and turbulence;

(2) satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations and other physics;

(3) being easy to implement and adjust to different cases.

Currently, methods of generating inlet conditions for LES are broadly divided into two categories classified by Tabor et al.:

The first method for generating turbulent inlets is to synthesize them according to particular cases, such as Fourier techniques, principle orthogonal decomposition (POD) and vortex methods. The synthesis techniques attempt to construct turbulent field at inlets that have suitable turbulence-like properties and make it easy to specify parameters of the turbulence, such as turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate. In addition, inlet conditions generated by using random numbers are computationally inexpensive. However, one serious drawback exists in the method. The synthesized turbulence does not satisfy the physical structure of fluid flow governed by Navier-Stokes equations.

The second method involves a separate and precursor calculation to generate a turbulent database which can be introduced into the main computation at the inlets. The database (sometimes named as ‘library’) can be generated in a number of ways, such as cyclic domains, pre-prepared library, and internal mapping. However, the method of generating turbulent inflow by precursor simulations requires large calculation capacity.

Researchers examining the application of various types of synthetic and precursor calculations have found that the more realistic the inlet turbulence, the more accurate LES predicts results.

== Modeling unresolved scales ==

To discuss the modeling of unresolved scales, first the unresolved scales must be classified. They fall into two groups: resolved sub-filter scales (SFS), and sub-grid scales(SGS).

The resolved sub-filter scales represent the scales with wave numbers larger than the cutoff wave number formula_93, but whose effects are dampened by the filter. Resolved sub-filter scales only exist when filters non-local in wave-space are used (such as a box or Gaussian filter). These resolved sub-filter scales must be modeled using filter reconstruction.

Sub-grid scales are any scales that are smaller than the cutoff filter width formula_6. The form of the SGS model depends on the filter implementation. As mentioned in the Numerical methods for LES section, if implicit LES is considered, no SGS model is implemented and the numerical effects of the discretization are assumed to mimic the physics of the unresolved turbulent motions.

=== Sub-grid scale models ===

Without a universally valid description of turbulence, empirical information must be utilized when constructing and applying SGS models, supplemented with fundamental physical constraints such as Galilean invariance
Two classes of SGS models exist; the first class is functional models and the second class is structural models. Some models may be categorized as both.

==== Functional (eddy–viscosity) models ====

Functional models are simpler than structural models, focusing only on dissipating energy at a rate that is physically correct. These are based on an artificial eddy viscosity approach, where the effects of turbulence are lumped into a turbulent viscosity. The approach treats dissipation of kinetic energy at sub-grid scales as analogous to molecular diffusion. In this case, the deviatoric part of formula_18 is modeled as:

:formula_96

where formula_97 is the turbulent eddy viscosity and formula_98 is the rate-of-strain tensor.

Based on dimensional analysis, the eddy viscosity must have units of formula_99. Most eddy viscosity SGS models model the eddy viscosity as the product of a characteristic length scale and a characteristic velocity scale.

===== Smagorinsky–Lilly model =====

The first SGS model developed was the Smagorinsky–Lilly SGS model, which was developed by Smagorinsky and used in the first LES simulation by Deardorff. It models the eddy viscosity as:

:formula_100

where formula_6 is the grid size and formula_102 is a constant.

This method assumes that the energy production and dissipation of the small scales are in equilibrium - that is, formula_103.

===== The Dynamic Model (Germano et al. and beyond)=====

Germano et al. identified a number of studies using the Smagorinsky model that each found different values for the Smagorinsky constant formula_102 for different flow configurations. In an attempt to formulate a more universal approach to SGS models, Germano et al. proposed a dynamic Smagorinsky model, which utilized two filters: a grid LES filter, denoted formula_105, and a test LES filter, denoted formula_106 for any turbulent field formula_107. The test filter is larger in size than the grid filter and adds an additional smoothing of the turbulence field over the already smoothed fields represented by the LES. Applying the test filter to the LES equations (which are obtained by applying the &quot;grid&quot; filter to Navier-Stokes equations) results in a new set of equations that are identical in form but with the SGS stress formula_108 replaced by formula_109. Germano &quot;et&quot; al. noted that even though neither formula_18 nor formula_111 can be computed exactly because of the presence of unresolved scales, there is an exact relation connecting these two tensors. This relation, known as the Germano identity is 
formula_112
Here formula_113 can be explicitly evaluated as it involves only the filtered velocities and the operation of test filtering. The significance of the identity is that if one assumes that turbulence is self similar so that the SGS stress at the grid and test levels have the same form formula_114 and formula_115, then the Germano identity provides an equation from which the Smagorinsky coefficient formula_102 (which is no longer a &#x27;constant&#x27;) can potentially be determined. 
[Inherent in the procedure is the assumption that the coefficient formula_102 is invariant of scale (see review
In order to do this, two additional steps were introduced in the original formulation. First, one assumed that even though formula_102 was in principle variable, the variation was sufficiently slow that it can be moved out of the filtering operation formula_119. Second, since formula_102 was a scalar, the Germano identity was contracted with a second rank tensor (the rate of strain tensor was chosen) to convert it to a scalar equation from which formula_102 could be determined.
Lilly

found a less arbitrary and therefore more satisfactory approach for obtaining C from the tensor identity. He noted that the Germano identity required the satisfaction of nine equations at each point in space (of which only five are independent) for a single quantity formula_102. The problem of obtaining formula_102 was therefore over-determined. He proposed therefore that formula_102 be determined using a least square fit by minimizing the residuals. This results in 
:formula_125
Here 
: formula_126 
and for brevity 
formula_127, 
formula_128 
Initial attempts to implement the model in LES simulations proved unsuccessful. First, the computed coefficient 
was not at all &quot;slowly varying&quot; as assumed and varied as much as any other turbulent field. Secondly, 
the computed formula_102 could be positive as well as negative. The latter fact in itself should not be regarded as a 
shortcoming as a priori tests using filtered DNS fields have shown that the local subgrid dissipation rate 
formula_130 in a turbulent field is almost as likely to be negative as it is positive even though the integral over the fluid domain is always positive representing a net dissipation of energy in the large scales. A slight preponderance of positive values as opposed to strict positivity of the eddy-viscosity results in the observed net dissipation. This so-called &quot;backscatter&quot; of energy from small to large scales indeed corresponds to negative C values in the Smagorinsky model. Nevertheless, the Germano-Lilly formulation was found not to result in stable calculations. An ad hoc measure was adopted by averaging the numerator and denominator over homogeneous directions (where such directions exist in the flow) 
: formula_131
When the averaging involved a large enough statistical sample that the computed formula_102 was positive (or at 
least only rarely negative) stable calculations were possible. Simply setting the negative values to zero (a procedure called &quot;clipping&quot;) with or without the averaging also resulted in stable calculations. 
Meneveau proposed 
an averaging over Lagrangian fluid trajectories with an exponentially decaying &quot;memory&quot;. This can be applied to problems lacking homogeneous directions and can be stable if the effective time over which the averaging is done is long enough and yet not so long as to smooth out spatial inhomogenieties of interest.

Lilly&#x27;s modification of the Germano method followed by a statistical averaging or synthetic removal of negative viscosity regions seems ad hoc, even if it could be made to &quot;work&quot;. An alternate formulation of the least square minimization procedure known as the &quot;Dynamic Localization Model&quot; (DLM) was suggested by 
Ghosal et al.
In this approach one first defines a quantity 
:formula_133
with the tensors formula_18 and formula_111 replaced by the appropriate SGS model. This tensor then represents the amount by which the subgrid model fails to respect the Germano identity at each spatial location. In Lilly&#x27;s approach, formula_102 is then pulled out of the hat operator 
:formula_137
making formula_138 an algebraic function of formula_102 which is then determined by requiring that
formula_140 considered as a function of C have the least possible value.
However, since the formula_102 thus obtained turns out to be just as variable as any other fluctuating quantity in turbulence, the original assumption of the constancy of formula_102 cannot be justified a posteriori. In the DLM approach one avoids this inconsistency by not invoking the step of removing 
C from the test filtering operation. Instead, one defines a global error over the entire flow domain by the quantity 
:formula_143
where the integral ranges over the whole fluid volume. This global error formula_144 is then a functional of the spatially varying function formula_145 (here the time instant, formula_146, is fixed and therefore appears just as a parameter) which is determined so as to minimize this functional. The solution to this variational problem is that formula_102 must satisfy a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind 
:formula_148 
where the functions formula_149 and formula_150 are defined in terms of the resolved fields formula_151 and are therefore known at each time step and the integral ranges over the whole fluid domain. The integral equation is solved numerically by an iteration procedure and convergence was found to be generally rapid if used with a pre-conditioning scheme. Even though this variational approach removes an inherent inconsistency in Lilly&#x27;s approach, the formula_145 obtained from the integral equation still displayed the instability associated with negative viscosities. This can be resolved by insisting that formula_153 be minimized subject to the constraint formula_154. This leads to an equation for formula_102 that is nonlinear 
:formula_156 
Here the suffix + indicates the &quot;positive part of&quot; that is, formula_157. Even though this superficially looks like &quot;clipping&quot; it is not an ad hoc scheme but a bonafide solution of the constrained variational problem. This DLM(+) model was found to be stable and yielded excellent results for forced and decaying isotropic turbulence, channel flows and a variety of other more complex geometries. If a flow happens to have homogeneous directions (let us say the directions x and z) then one can introduce the ansatz 
formula_158. The variational approach then immediately yields Lilly&#x27;s result with averaging over homogeneous directions without any need for ad hoc modifications of a prior result.

One shortcoming of the DLM(+) model was that it did not describe backscatter which is known to be a real &quot;thing&quot; from analyzing DNS data. Two approaches were developed to address this. In one approach due to Carati et al. 

a fluctuating force with amplitude determined by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is added in 
analogy to Landau&#x27;s theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics. In the second approach, one notes that 
any &quot;backscattered&quot; energy appears in the resolved scales only at the expense of energy in the subgrid 
scales. The DLM can be modified in a simple way to take into account this physical fact so as to allow 
for backscatter while being inherently stable. This k-equation version of the DLM, DLM(k) replaces 
formula_159 in the Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model by formula_160 as an appropriate velocity scale. The procedure for determining formula_102 remains identical to the &quot;unconstrained&quot; version except that the tensors formula_162,
formula_163 where the sub-test scale kinetic 
energy K is related to the subgrid scale kinetic energy k by formula_164 
(follows by taking the trace of the Germano identity). To determine k we now use a transport equation 
:formula_165
where formula_166 is the kinematic viscosity and formula_167 are positive coefficients 
representing kinetic energy dissipation and diffusion respectively. These can be determined following the dynamic 
procedure with constrained minimization as in DLM(+). This approach, though more expensive to implement than the DLM(+) was found to be stable and resulted in good agreement with experimental data for a variety of flows
tested. Furthermore, it is mathematically impossible for the DLM(k) to result in an unstable computation as the sum of the large scale and SGS energies is non-increasing by construction. Both of these approaches incorporating backscatter works well. They yield models that are slightly less dissipative with somewhat improved performance over the DLM(+). The DLM(k) model additionally yields the subgrid kinetic energy, which may be a physical quantity of interest. These improvements are achieved at a somewhat increased cost in model implementation.

The Dynamic Model originated at the 1990 Summer Program of the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR) at Stanford University. A series of &quot;CTR-Tea&quot; seminars celebrated the 30th Anniversary of this important milestone in turbulence modeling.

<doc id="1178441" wikidata="Q2830505" url="?curid=1178441" title="Alan Ford (actor)">
<text>Alan Ford (born 23 February 1938) is an English actor. He is best known for his roles in Guy Ritchie gangster movies &quot;Snatch&quot; and &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, and from appearing as separate characters in eight episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot;.

==Early life==
Ford was born on 23 February 1938 in Camberwell, South London, the eldest son of a seamstress and a taxi driver, and grew up in Elephant and Castle. He left school at the age of 15 and took on various jobs, ending with two years of national service in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

==Studies and training==
François Truffaut cast Ford as one of the firemen in his &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. Next, Ford secured a place at East 15 Acting School. For three years he studied drama in all its forms: Shakespeare, Chekhov, restoration, &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, pantomime, music, dance, fencing, Stanislavski and improvisation. One of his tutors there at that time was the then unknown Mike Leigh. 

==Acting career==
Ford has appeared on stage at the National Theatre, Royal Court Theatre, the Theatre Royal Stratford East and many repertory theatres.

Ford appeared in &quot;&quot; and, much earlier, as Roosta in the original radio version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, along with a small speaking role in &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;.

Ford played Clifford Harding in G.F. Newman&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1978, then had a brief role in the film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, where he plays the taxi driver who says the line, &quot;It puts you in mind of the days of the old demon barber of Fleet Street, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; in response to the recent wave of murders around London. He has also proven himself a comic actor. He was involved in the Armando Iannucci production &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;, playing a boxing promoter called Terry Norton; and he worked again with Iannucci playing the &#x27;East End Thug&#x27; in &quot;The Armando Iannucci Shows&quot;. He later appeared as a priest in every episode of &quot;Snuff Box&quot;. In 2015, he played former Thotch band manager &#x27;Big&#x27; Basil Steel in &quot;Brian Pern: 45 Years of Prog &amp; Roll&quot;.

In 1998, Ford narrated and appeared in the Guy Ritchie directed crime comedy &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, and, in 2000, he appeared as the crime boss &#x27;Brick Top&#x27; in Ritchie&#x27;s film &quot;Snatch&quot;.

In 2003, Ford provided the voice of Goliath in the British version of &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Circus&quot;.

Ford was featured in the 2010 music video &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Felon&quot; by The Lostprophets.

In 2011 he starred as crime boss &#x27;Carter&#x27; in the film noir &quot;Jack Falls&quot; alongside his &quot;Lock, Stock&quot; co-stars Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, while in 2014, he was cast in the crime thriller &quot;Two Days in the Smoke&quot; alongside fellow &quot;Lock, Stock&quot; actor Stephen Marcus.

In 2013 Ford had a guest role in the Norwegian-American TV show &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; as crime family boss &#x27;Uncle Terry&#x27;.

In 2018, Ford appeared in a primary supporting role as Dale Jacobs in the psychological thriller &quot;Winter Ridge&quot;.

It was announced in November 2023 that Ford was to be cast in &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Billy Mitchell&#x27;s (Perry Fenwick) father Stevie Mitchell. The character first appeared for the funeral of the character Aunt Sal (Anna Karen).

==Writer==
In 2006, Ford published his novel &quot;Thin Ice&quot;. He said the book &quot;evolved from a collection of anecdotes and actors&#x27; tales.&quot;

<text>Alan Graham MacDiarmid, ONZ FRS (14 April 1927 – 7 February 2007) was a New Zealand-born American chemist, and one of three recipients of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2000.

==Early life and education==
MacDiarmid was born in Masterton, New Zealand, as one of five children – three brothers and two sisters. His family was relatively poor, and the Great Depression made life difficult in Masterton, due to which his family shifted to Lower Hutt, a few miles from Wellington, New Zealand. At around age ten, he developed an interest in chemistry from one of his father&#x27;s old textbooks, and he taught himself from this book and from library books.

MacDiarmid was educated at Hutt Valley High School and Victoria University of Wellington.

In 1943, MacDiarmid passed the University of New Zealand&#x27;s University Entrance Exam and its Medical Preliminary Exam. He then took up a part-time job as a &quot;lab boy&quot; or janitor at Victoria University of Wellington during his studies for a BSc degree, which he completed in 1947. He was then appointed demonstrator in the undergraduate laboratories. After completing an MSc in chemistry from the same university, he worked as an assistant in its chemistry department. It was here that he had his first publication in 1949, in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;. He graduated in 1951 with first class honours, and won a Fulbright Fellowship to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He majored in inorganic chemistry, receiving his M.S. degree in 1952 and his PhD in 1953. He then won a Shell Graduate Scholarship, which enabled him to go to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he completed a second PhD in 1955.

==Career and research==
MacDiarmid worked in the School of Chemistry at the University of St Andrews in Scotland for a year as a member of the junior faculty. He then took a faculty position in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, USA, where he became a full professor in 1964. MacDiarmid spent the greater part of his career on the chemistry faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked for 45 years. The first twenty years of his research there focused on silicon chemistry. He was appointed Blanchard Professor of Chemistry in 1988.

In 2002 MacDiarmid also joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Dallas.

=== Conductive polymers===
His best-known research was the discovery and development of conductive polymers—plastic materials that conduct electricity. He collaborated with the Japanese chemist Hideki Shirakawa and the American physicist Alan Heeger in this research and published the first results in 1977. The three of them shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.

The Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery that plastics can, after certain modifications, be made electrically conductive. The work progressed to yield important practical applications. Conductive plastics can be used for anti-static substances for photographic film and &#x27;smart&#x27; windows that can exclude sunlight. Semi-conductive polymers have been applied in light-emitting diodes, solar cells and displays in mobile telephones. Future developments in molecular electronics are predicted to dramatically increase the speed while reducing the size of computers.

MacDiarmid also travelled around the world for speaking engagements that impressed upon listeners the value of globalising the effort of innovation in the 21st century. In one of his last courses, in 2001, MacDiarmid elected to lead a small seminar of incoming freshmen about his research activities. Overall, his name is on over 600 published papers and 20 patents.

==Personal life==
Towards the end of his life, MacDiarmid was ill with myelodysplastic syndrome. In early February 2007 he was planning to travel back to New Zealand, when he fell down the stairs in his home in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, and died on 7 February 2007. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill.

MacDiarmid&#x27;s first wife, Marian Mathieu, who he had married in 1954, died in 1990. He is survived by four children: Heather McConnell, Dawn Hazelett, Duncan MacDiarmid and Gail Williams, from their marriage and nine grandchildren: Dr. Sean McConnell, Dr. Ryan McConnell, Rebecca McConnell, Dr. Clayton Hazelett, Wesley Hazelett, Langston MacDiarmid, Aubree Williams, Austin Williams and George Williams. MacDiarmid was also survived by his second wife, Gayl Gentile, whom he married in 2005; she died in 2014.

MacDiarmid was a first cousin of New Zealand expatriate painter Douglas MacDiarmid. The year after Alan received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, Douglas painted a portrait of his cousin for the New Zealand Portrait Gallery.

MacDiarmid was also active as a naturist and nudist, and considered himself a sun-worshipper and keen waterskier.

<text>Donald Pierce is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a cyborg and is commonly an enemy of the X-Men.

Donald Pierce appears in the 2017 film &quot;Logan&quot;, portrayed by Boyd Holbrook.

==Publication history==

Donald Pierce first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #132 April 1980, and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Pierce&#x27;s name and appearance were modeled by Byrne upon Donald Sutherland. The character&#x27;s last name comes from Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce, Sutherland&#x27;s character in the 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Donald Pierce was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He first appears as a high-ranking member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, where he holds the position of White Bishop. However, Pierce is in fact a genocidal mutant hater, and has only joined the Hellfire Club to kill the Inner Circle&#x27;s other members, all of whom are mutants. In addition to hating mutants, Pierce is also bigoted towards certain nationalities and harbors a sense of self-loathing due to his cyborg status, referring to himself as &quot;only half a man&quot;. He is the CEO and principal shareholder of Pierce-Consolidated Mining, and operates out of a mining and laboratory complex in Cameron, Kentucky. Pierce and his mercenaries kidnap Professor X and Tessa in a plot against the Hellfire Club and X-Men, but he is defeated by the Professor despite a device shielding against telepathic attacks. Pierce is handed over to Tessa of the Hellfire Club, expelled from the Inner Circle, and taken to a secret holding facility in one of Shaw Industries&#x27; Kentucky installations.

===The Reavers===
Many months later, Pierce is violently liberated from the holding facility. Though his rescuers are never explicitly identified, he resurfaces alongside three members of the Reavers, a band of cyborg criminals which Pierce claims to have built and assembled, and which had recently been all but wiped out by the X-Men. The four of them ally with Lady Deathstrike and three Hellfire Club mercenaries (Cole, Macon, and Reese) who were cybernetically enhanced by Pierce. Under Pierce&#x27;s leadership, the new Reavers are dedicated to exterminating mutants, with highest priority given to the X-Men and Sebastian Shaw (CEO of Shaw Industries).

The Reavers take over the X-Men&#x27;s headquarters in their absence, but after the X-Men leave through the Siege Perilous, they manage to capture only Wolverine whom they torture and crucify. During this time, Pierce develops a romantic attraction towards Lady Deathstrike but the woman is disgusted by Pierce&#x27;s arrogance and spurns him, and Wolverine is rescued by Jubilee and the two mutants go into hiding. Pierce tracks the two down, but is incapacitated by Jubilee. Assuming the mutants fled to Muir Island, Pierce and the Reavers attack Muir Island, and battle Moira MacTaggart&#x27;s &quot;Muir Island X-Men&quot; and Freedom Force. With the Reavers, he also attacks Frost Technologies&#x27; plant in California. Pierce creates two super intelligent sentient androids (Elsie-Dee and Albert), programming the two to find Wolverine and self-destruct. However, the androids&#x27; intelligence allows the two to put the bomb in Elsie-Dee on hold, and abandon the Reavers.

The Upstarts&#x27; members Trevor Fitzroy sends reprogrammed Sentinels to destroy the Reavers, as they are a threat to mutants and the former White King is worth a lot of &quot;points&quot; in the deadly game the Upstarts play. Only Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape. Pierce has Gateway teleport him to the one responsible for the attack on the Reavers, but the Sentinels accompanying Fitzroy to electrocute him. Despite his seeming demise, he later resurfaces, starts an anti-mutant hate group, and enlists several members; revealing a plot to take militant terrorist actions against mutants and thwarted by the X-Men, he is beaten by Wolverine in hand-to-hand combat. Very little of Pierce&#x27;s human tissue remains, which explains how he was able to survive the massacre in Australia with only portions of his upper torso intact.

Pierce would remain with the Hellfire Club for some time, eventually showing a more adversarial relationship with Shaw as the current Black King. He heads out to an outpost in Switzerland believed to be the immortal tyrant Apocalypse&#x27;s old stronghold, to obtain the first mutant&#x27;s power and technological marvels, also to secure his position within the Hellfire Club&#x27;s inner circle. In one such botched expedition involving the mutant time traveler Cable, he was believed to be flash incinerated when he, Shaw and a guide leading them through another of the first mutant&#x27;s lairs unleashed a techno-organic entity created by the mutant overlord in the past. All managed to survive unscathed, save for Pierce himself whose injuries further cost him much of his remaining flesh, revealing his head to be his only remaining fully organic component. Due to his constant failures and Shaw&#x27;s general contempt of him, Pierce is eventually cut loose from the Inner Circle, left to plummet to his death from an escaping helicopter. Ironically enough he would later find refuge in one of Cable&#x27;s old safe-houses, whose futuristic resources and databases he would use in reconstructing his damaged body, making himself a new cybernetic shell out of solid Adamantium he stole from another cyborg&#x27;s secret cache. When Logan and Jubilee happened upon his machinations thanks to Gateway, the two were able to preempt whatever plans he had alongside Khyber, the mysterious cyborg whose Adamantium reserves Pierce stole, who had intervened. 

Pierce later re-emerges, employing cyborgs Pico, Lady Deathstrike, and Skullbuster in an attempt to abduct Milo Thurman (Domino&#x27;s estranged husband) from his US government holding facility. As Thurman has the genius ability to predict future events accurately from current data, Pierce wishes to integrate Thurman into his cybernetic brain so he may use this ability to exert further control of the world&#x27;s future. Pierce reveals that after the events involving Fitzroy at the Hellfire Club, his mind and body were restored by a mysterious benefactor, and he now has a new prime directive. Just as Pierce downloads Thurman&#x27;s mind into his own, Domino destroys Pierce&#x27;s appropriated Weapon X base. Domino escapes, but Pierce and Thurman both seemingly perish in the ensuing explosion.

===As a Purifier===
Pierce next tries to take over Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s new Hellfire Club, launching an attack and slashing Shaw&#x27;s chest. Though Shaw is left critically injured and later needed to be hospitalized, Shaw is able to punch off Pierce&#x27;s head. Pierce later is forcibly recruited into the Purifiers&#x27; ranks and infected with the Technarch transmode virus. Being under the control of the mutant-hunting robot Bastion, he shows his mutant target: the newly formed Young X-Men.

===Young X-Men===
He appears in a nightmare of the precognitive mutant Blindfold, battling a not yet formed team of X-Men and killing one of their number. Pierce himself recruited this team using an image inducer to pose as Cyclops (the X-Men&#x27;s leader). His reasons for recruiting these mutants as &quot;X-Men&quot; are not entirely clear, however, it appears that his primary focus is to eliminate the Hellfire Club&#x27;s current Lord Imperial Roberto da Costa and former New Mutants allies. He also hires Ink to deliver Dani and Blindfold to him, misleading him. Following the confrontation with the Young X-Men, his face is scoured by Dust.

With face&#x27;s synthetic skin restored, he is kept captive by the Young X-Men. Ink is allowed to stay on the team and despite contention from Rockslide, later apologizes to Blindfold for working for Pierce, who remains in X-Men captivity. Pierce and Dust have frequent conversations while he is imprisoned, despite his vocal hatred of mutants and derogatory remarks toward Dust&#x27;s faith in Islam, noting that his attitude reminds Dust of home. While they talk, Dust admits to Pierce of dying, as he is &quot;the only one who won&#x27;t care&quot; and he agrees to share with Dust the secret information he has about teammates. He tells Dust that Ink is the mystery &quot;non-mutant&quot; among them, which is later discovered by the rest of the team. Also, he subtly says that three will die soon, referring to Boom Boom, Hellion and Surge, who were captured by the Sapien League and injected with a strain of the Legacy Virus.

===Second Coming===
It was eventually revealed that Pierce was only captured to act as Bastion&#x27;s mole inside the X-Men&#x27;s headquarters, all the while building several structures that surround Utopia.

Later after receiving the green light from Bastion to proceed with their plan, Pierce provokes an explosion that decimates all the X-Men&#x27;s jets and the Blackbirds. Pierce stands amid the debris, and muses to the X-Men that he is sorry that he will not live to witness the decimation of the mutant race. Cyclops eliminates him with an optic blast.

===Uncanny Avengers===
Donald was seen alive again with the rest of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Inner Circle on a pleasure cruise reserved for super criminals and cabals. He along with his compatriots were seen at a gambling den aboard the vessel as the Avengers Unity Division were searching for The Red Skull across the world.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
Shortly after his return as seen during the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Pierce and the Reavers were left in dire straits since they failed a couple of jobs as a unit. Worn down and nearly broken by hard times the cyborg posse took up one last job to earn enough cash for a total refit - exhuming the grave for the deceased Wolverine. They were disappointed to find that Logan&#x27;s body had been removed from the Adamantium casing after Cylla Markham had cracked it open using a Molecular Rearranger, to which after a lengthily battle with the X-Men, Pierce and the others were rounded up and deposited into the care of Alpha Flight, as their attempt at grave robbery happened upon Canadian soil.

===O*N*E Conscription===
Due to lack of resources and proper jurisdiction however, Pierce and the rest of the Reavers were eventually turned over to the Office of National Emergency. The mutant related activity hating General Robert Callahan had Pierce run a couple of missions for the mutant crimes task force bureau on the false promise of freedom and much-needed system overhauls. With the latest acquisition of Miss Sinister however, General Callahan revealed the duplicity by triggering remote fail-safes installed during the Reavers&#x27; refitting. Pierce and select members of his crew were forced to impart their technologies and mechanical skills into building up Callahan&#x27;s mutant-hunting gear, the rest of whom had been given the kill order by the corrupt commander to his soldiers, an event which soon made public news and garnered the attention of some ragtag X-Men.

After many of these mutants had been captured on live television, the remains of Pierce&#x27;s cyborg crew, led by leftover mutant heroes Havok and Warpath, launched an assault on the Location 22 base camp of O*N*E withholding and experimenting on their friends. Where it is revealed that the list of mutant targets Callahan had the Reavers go after were the likely holders of what was the last component needed to upgrade the Sentinel Squad One unit. Havok, having had it in possession since the moral inversion, traded it for the Reavers&#x27; help, learning too late that the final piece was a nanite-coded module fashioned by Bastion that enables any machine to assimilate and incorporate any new technology into themselves adaptively.

A deadly new modification which Pierce&#x27;s forces put to horrifying use as they assimilated the Squad Sentinels, turning them into new bodies for their penultimate use. With the ultimate augmentation in tow, Pierce and the now giant mech-upgraded Reavers move out to attack the X-Mansion, showing off their extravagant techno-morphing upgrades as they take and receive damage in battle. But they are soon undone by the mutants they believed to have double-crossed and destroyed back at the 22 base. Dazzler, after having absorbed Sean&#x27;s shriek after the latter had nanotech parasitically hot-wired by Skullduster, let out a massive photokinetic pulse blast which stunned the Reavers and totaled their Sentinel bodies, putting them down for the count. Eventually, O*N*E would show up, taking both Havok and the Reavers back into their custody.

===A.I. Uprising===
During the &quot;Iron Man 2020&quot; event, Albert was directed by Tyger Tiger to Reavers Universal Robotics (Pierce&#x27;s company) in Madripoor and is confronted by Bonebreaker and the Reavers. Pierce arrives to prevent the lobby from being wrecked. Taking Albert on tour, Pierce states that he has been upgrading his operations with the help of a 3D Printer. When Pierce states that Elsie-Dee is not here and previously appeared asking to disarm the self-destruct mechanism, Albert retaliates while claiming that Pierce doesn&#x27;t own the two androids. After Albert subdues the Reavers, Pierce states having sold Elsie-Dee&#x27;s head to yakuza boss Kimura, the arms to the Jade Dragon Triad, and the legs to the Vladivostok Mafia. After Albert heads out, Bonebreaker reports that some toxic fumes escaped from the airlock and advises to put a respirator on as Pierce plans to put a suffering chip in Albert&#x27;s head. After getting the parts from them, Albert puts Elsie-Dee back together. In light of Albert&#x27;s actions towards them, the Reavers, Kimura, the Jade Dragon Triad, and the Vladivostok Mafia take action against Albert, vowing that the android will never leave Madripoor intact. In downtown Madripoor, Pierce and the Reavers are traveling through the vacant streets as they state that Albert and Elsie-Dee will have to travel through the Vladivostok Mafia&#x27;s turf before they can engage them. Arriving at Madripoor Airport, the Reavers cover all the entrances to ensure Albert and Elsie-Dee do not leave Madripoor. The Reavers bring a high-velocity railgun in. During Albert and Elsie-Dee&#x27;s fight with Kimura&#x27;s men, Kimura stops the attack and informs Albert and Elsie-Dee about the ambush. As Kimura&#x27;s limousine fools the Reavers into thinking that Albert and Elsie-Dee hijacked it and fired the railgun on it, Kimura smuggles Albert and Elsie-Dee out of Madripoor in a box claiming that it is filled with slot machine parts bound for Macao. The Reavers checked the limousine wreckage and found that Albert and Elsie-Dee were not there.

==Powers and abilities==
Donald Pierce is a cyborg originally with four artificial limbs which provide him with superhuman strength. His speed, reflexes and agility are also inhumanly high, attributes which are derived from his replacement extremities. His body has great resistance to damage and even if it is destroyed, as long as his head is intact he will probably survive. Before and after securing some of Cable&#x27;s technology from the future and incorporating it into himself, he boasted a wide cadre of skills and abilities, such as generating a shocking plasma current through his cyborg limbs or hurling it as electrical force over short distances. His bionic body once hosted adamantium as an outer shell which further bolstered his resistance to damage. He also boasts bionic optics, which feed into his Technarch mind to memorize and relay information, giving him an eidetic memory and photography vision. Pierce can plastically morph his arms into weapons like skeins, cannons, pincers, finger missiles, and razor claws, likely through nanotechnology. His elongated nails can channel the electrical energies he generates into them, increasing his cutting edge.

Nothing is left of his original human body, save for his head, which was given a fake flesh and bone structural appearance through a synthetic skin hiding a robotic skull underneath. As such, he is immune to psionic infraction thanks to various brain implants for telepathic resistance, also having the ability to turn psionic assaults against the attacker to a limited degree. He also boasted rocket-powered flight capabilities, enabling Pierce to fly at unknown speeds for prolonged periods. He also has an Image Inducer to disguise himself with, used for infiltration purposes like moving undercover through the Xavier Institute as Cyclops for a time. He even boasts a personal teleporter device of his own design for quick escapes. It is unknown if he still has his original brain or if he uploaded his memories, intelligence, and thought engrams into a cyborg computer brain. As a member of the Reavers, he often wore body armor.

During his indoctrination into Bastion&#x27;s Purifiers Donald was also modified with a Transmode Virus infection that made him subservient to the killer A.I.&#x27;s command code. While he has not shown any mechamorphing abilities of the Technarch, he has shown the ability to simulate Scott&#x27;s optic blast power while disguised as him. Aside from his physical advantages, Donald Pierce is a genius in robotics, cybernetics and electronics. In these fields he has developed technology that exceeds that of conventional science by approximately two centuries. He is also a seasoned leader with vast financial and human resources (a prerequisite for membership in the Hellfire Club). He is a college graduate in geological engineering and business administration, and is an accomplished strategist and business administrator. Pierce is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, but mainly relies on his cyborg strength and is more prone to letting others fight his battles for him rather than fight on the front lines. In later publishing after coming under the services of the Office of National Emergency, Pierce as with all of his Reavers gained the ability to cyperpathically possess and/or assimilate any piece of engineered conveyance he can get his hands on. Effectively rebuilding and bulking himself up from any and every automated fabrication around him, I.E. commandeering a Sentinel for a new body or turning a truck into an arm cannon.

==Reception==
* In 2017, &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked Donald Pierce 9th in their &quot;10 Most Evil X-Men Villains&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Pierce was the leader of the Reavers, a band of human assassins enhanced by Apocalypse&#x27;s techno-organic virus. Thanks to the virus, Pierce and his band of assassins become cyborgs with regenerative abilities and the power to assimilate both organic and non-organic material to mutate themselves. Pierce infiltrated the territory of the Human High Council in an attempt to destroy the Council fleet and later attempted to kill Gateway, an ally of the HHC. After the fleet was assembled for an attack on Apocalypse&#x27;s empire, Pierce infected Carol Danvers with the remains of the Reaver Vultura to aid him in the destruction of the fleet. During his attack he also used Brian Braddock, who was under Apocalypse&#x27;s mind control, to kill Emma Frost, though he resisted Pierce&#x27;s orders, for which Pierce killed him. In the end, Pierce was destroyed by Weapon X.

A human team known only as X-Terminators had used Pierce&#x27;s blood sample before he was infected by the techno-organic virus to create several clones of him to help the fight against the mutants. One such clone began operating under the codename &quot;Goodnight&quot; and infiltrated the Hellfire Club, becoming a great friend of Sebastian Shaw. The general public and Club members think he is in fact a mutant.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot;, Donald was a member of the Human Liberation Front, one of the many human resistance groups labeled as terrorists by the House of M. Alongside Seiji Ashida, the father of Surge, he was part of the HLF&#x27;s base in Tokyo, which had targeted Project Genesis, a plan of Emperor Sunfire to forcefully mutate baseline humans.

<text>The Australian Human Rights Commission is the national human rights institution of the Commonwealth of Australia, established in 1986 as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and renamed in 2008. It is a statutory body funded by, but operating independently of, the Australian Government. It is responsible for investigating alleged infringements of Australia&#x27;s anti-discrimination legislation in relation to federal agencies.

The Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 articulates the Australian Human Rights Commission&#x27;s role and responsibilities. Matters that can be investigated by the Commission under the &quot;Australian Human Rights Commission Regulations 2019&quot; include discrimination on the grounds of age, medical record, an irrelevant criminal record; disability; marital or relationship status; nationality; sexual orientation; or trade union activity.

==Commission officebearers==
The Commission falls under the portfolio of the Attorney-General of Australia.

===Commission presidents===
The following individuals have been appointed as President of the Human Rights Commission, and its precedent organisation:
===Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioners===
The following individuals have been appointed as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner:
===Disability Discrimination Commissioners===
The following individuals have been appointed as a Disability Discrimination Commissioners:
===Human Rights Commissioners===
The following individuals have been appointed as a Human Rights Commissioner:
===Race Discrimination Commissioners===
The following individuals have been appointed as a Race Discrimination Commissioner:
===Sex Discrimination Commissioners===
The following individuals have been appointed as a Sex Discrimination Commissioner:
===Age Discrimination Commissioner===
The following individuals have been appointed as an Age Discrimination Commissioner, or precedent titles:
=== National Children&#x27;s Commissioner ===
The following individuals have been appointed as a National Children&#x27;s Commissioner:
=== Privacy Commissioner ===
The following have served as Privacy Commissioner, initially at HREOC and then at two other Offices:
On 1 January 1989 the &quot;Privacy Act 1988&quot; established the Privacy Commissioner within the commission. The Privacy Commissioner continued in the commission until 1 July 2000, when a new Office of the Privacy Commissioner was established by the federal Parliament, and the Privacy Commissioner was separated from the commission.

In 2010, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established and the previously independent Office of the Privacy Commissioner was subsumed into it. The Privacy Commissioner now came under the supervision of the new Australian Information Commissioner, who could exercise the Privacy Commissioner&#x27;s powers.

From 2014, the incoming Australian government under PM Tony Abbott attempted to abolish the OAIC, succeeding in having the Australian Information Commissioner (John McMillan) unexpectedly retire early and FOI Commissioner (James Popple) resign, and cutting OAIC&#x27;s budget. But the Senate failed to pass the necessary legislation (Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014). Several former judges suggested this pursuit of the abolition of a body created by Parliament without its support for that abolition raises constitutional and rule of law concerns. Then-Privacy Commissioner Pilgrim was appointed Acting Australian Information Commissioner in July 2015 for three months, filling all three OAIC roles on a part-time basis (and now also administering the &quot;Freedom of Information Act 1982&quot; (Cth) and the &quot;Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010&quot; (Cth)). He was reappointed as Acting Australian Information Commissioner in October 2015 for three months, and again on 19 January 2016 until 19 April 2016.

In early 2016, it remained unclear whether the Privacy Commissioner role would be returned to the Commission if the abolition of the OAIC were to succeed.

On 18 March 2016, the Commonwealth Attorney-General advertised for expressions of interest in the positions, to commence in July, of Age Discrimination Commissioner, Disability Discrimination Commissioner and Human Rights Commissioner; these positions were filled accordingly.

== Legislation ==
From its introduction until 2000, the Commission hosted the Commissioner administering the &quot;Privacy Act 1988&quot; (Cth).

The Commission investigates alleged infringements under the following federal legislation:
*&quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; (Cth)
*&quot;Sex Discrimination Act 1984&quot; (Cth)
*&quot;Disability Discrimination Act 1992&quot; (Cth)
*&quot;Age Discrimination Act 2004&quot; (Cth)
*&quot;Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986&quot; (Cth) (formerly &quot;Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986&quot;)

The &quot;Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986&quot; articulates the Australian Human Rights Commission&#x27;s role and responsibilities. It gives effect to Australia&#x27;s obligations under the following:

* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);
* Convention Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation (ILO 111);
* Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
* Convention on the Rights of the Child;
* Declaration of the Rights of the Child;
* Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons;
* Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons; and
* Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.

Matters that can be investigated by the Commission under the &quot;Australian Human Rights Commission Regulations 2019&quot; include discrimination on the grounds of age, medical record, an irrelevant criminal record; disability; marital or relationship status; nationality; sexual orientation; or trade union activity.

== Public inquiries ==
One of the more visible functions of the commission is to conduct public inquiries. Some examples of inquiries conducted include:
*Homeless Children Inquiry (1989) 
*National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia (1989-1991)
*Inquiry into the Accessibility of electronic commerce and new service and information technologies for older Australians and people with a disability (2000)
*Pregnancy Discrimination Inquiry (2000)
*Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Inquiry into financial and workplace discrimination against same-sex couples
*Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families (Bringing Them Home Report (1997))
*National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention (2004) The report, &quot;A Last Resort?&quot; was published in April 2004.
*National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention (2014) &quot;The Forgotten Children&quot; report was submitted by Gillian Triggs in November 2014.
*Pregnancy and Return to Work National Review (2014)

==Reviews==
On 30 July 2020, the Australian Human Rights Commission announced that they would conduct a review of the country&#x27;s gymnastics program, following complaints of physical and mental abuse from some of the former athletes. Former Australian gymnasts had reported being assaulted by coaches, fat-shamed and made to train and compete while injured.

==Gender identity and sexuality==

Private members&#x27; bills introduced from both the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats tried to add sexuality and/or gender identity to the list of matters that can be investigated by the commission, which always failed to pass at least one house of parliament between 1995 and June 2007, because of a lack of support from both the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition in the federal parliament.

Relevant legislation was later passed in Acts such as the &quot;Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013&quot;.

==Human Rights Awards and Medals ==

Since 1987, the Human Rights Awards have been presented at the commission&#x27;s annual Human Rights Medal and Awards ceremony.

==International status==
The Commission is one of some 70 national human rights institutions (NHRIs) accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), a body sponsored by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The Commission&#x27;s full (&quot;A status&quot;) accreditation has allowed it special access to the United Nations human rights system, including speaking rights at the Human Rights Council and other committees. The Commission has been able to present parallel reports (&quot;shadow reports&quot;) to UN treaty committees examining Australia&#x27;s compliance with international human rights instruments. It has been very active in developing NHRIs throughout the Asia-Pacific region, and is a leading member of the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs, one of four regional sub-groups of NHRIs.

In April 2022, GANHRI informed the Commission that it has lost its &quot;A status&quot; and that its status would be reviewed after approximately 18 months. GANHRI found that recent government decisions to appoint Commissioners had not been made with appropriate transparency. It was also concerned about accumulated reductions in funding.

<doc id="1178453" wikidata="Q3141326" url="?curid=1178453" title="Yuan Longping">
<text>Yuan Longping (; September 7, 1930May 22, 2021) was a Chinese agronomist and inventor. He was a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering known for developing the first hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s, part of the Green Revolution in agriculture. For his contributions, Yuan is known as the &quot;Father of Hybrid Rice&quot;. Yuan was bestowed the Medal of the Republic, the highest honorary medal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in September 2019.

Hybrid rice has since been grown in dozens of countries in Africa, America, and Asia—boosting food security and providing a robust food source in areas with a high risk of famine. The technology allowed China to sustain 20% of the global population on 9% of global arable land, an achievement in food security for which he was awarded the 2004 World Food Prize and the 2004 Wolf Prize in Agriculture respectively.

== Early life and education ==
Yuan was born at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China on September 7, 1930 to Yuan Xinglie and Hua Jing. He was the second of six siblings. His ancestral home is in De&#x27;an County, Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province in Southern China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, he moved with his family and attended school in many places, including Hunan, Chongqing, Hankou and Nanjing.

He graduated from Southwest Agricultural College (now part of Southwest University) in 1953.

==Career==
Yuan began his teaching career at the Anjiang Agricultural School, Hunan Province. In the 1960s he had the idea of hybridizing rice to increase its yield after reading of similar research that was underway successfully in maize and sorghum. Undertaking this hybridization was important because the first generation of hybrids is typically more vigorous and productive than either parent.

For the rest of his life Yuan devoted himself to the research and development of better rice varieties.

The biggest problem was that rice is a self-pollinating plant. Hybridization requires separate male and female plants as parents. The small rice flowers contain both male and female parts. Although the male parts can be removed, carefully, by hand (to produce female-only flowers), this is not practical on a large scale. It was thus difficult to produce hybrid rice in large quantities. In 1961 he spotted a seed-head of wild hybrid rice. By 1964, Yuan hypothesized that naturally-mutated male-sterile rice could exist and could be used for the creation of new hybrid rice varieties. He and a student spent the summer searching for male sterile rice plants. Two years later he reported in a scientific publication that he had found a few individuals of male-sterile rice with potential for production of hybrid rice. Subsequent experiments proved his original hypothesis feasible, which proved to be his most important contribution to hybrid rice.


Yuan went on to solve more problems over the next decades to achieve higher yielding hybrid rice. This took more than a decade. The first experimental hybrid rice did not show any significant advantage over commonly grown varieties, so Yuan suggested crossbreeding cultivated rice varieties with ones growing wild in the countryside. In 1970, beside a railway line in Hainan, he and his team found a particularly important wild variety. Using this one within a breeding programme resulted in varieties with yields improved by 20 - 30% in the late 1970s. For this achievement, Yuan Longping was dubbed the &quot;Father of Hybrid Rice.&quot;

At present, as much as 50 percent of China&#x27;s total number of rice paddies grow Yuan Longping&#x27;s hybrid rice and these hybrid rice paddies yield 60 percent of the total rice production in China. China&#x27;s total rice output rose from 56.9 million tons in 1950 to 194.7 million tons in 2017. The annual yield increase is enough to feed 70 million additional people.

The &quot;Super Rice&quot; Yuan worked on improving showed a 30 percent higher yield, compared to common rice, with a record yield of 17,055 kilograms per hectare being registered in Yongsheng County in Yunnan Province in 1999.

In January 2014, Yuan said in an interview that genetically modified food would be the future direction of food and that he had been working on genetic modification of rice.

==Early stages of hybrid rice experiments==
===Ideology===
As recently as the 1950s, two separate theories of heredity were taught in China. One theory was from Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan and was based on the concept of genes and alleles. The other theory was from Soviet Union scientists Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin and Trofim Lysenko which stated that organisms would change over the course of their lives to adapt to environmental changes they experienced and their offspring would then inherit the changes. At the time, the Chinese government&#x27;s official stance on scientific theories was one of &quot;leaning towards the Soviet side&quot;, and any ideology from the Soviet Union was deemed to be the only truth while everything else would be seen as being invalid. Yuan, as an agricultural student at Southwest University, remained skeptical on both theories and started his own experiments to try and come up with his own conclusions.

Yuan was taught and mentored by some biologists who followed the ideas of Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan. These included Guan Xianghuan at Southwest Agricultural College and, later, Bao Wenkui at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. Both were persecuted. Guan took his own life in the 1960s while Bao was imprisoned. In 1962, Yuan visited Bao to discuss Mendelian genetics, and Bao gave him access to up-to-date foreign scientific literature. In 1966 Yuan himself was named as a counter-revolutionary and there were plans to imprison him. However, a letter of support for Yuan and his work was received based on his publication about male-sterile rice, sent from Nie Rongzhen, director of the National Science and Technology Commission. As a result, Yuan was allowed to continue his research and provided with both research assistants and financial support by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee leader Hua Guofeng and others. Yuan did not join the Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution or later.

Yuan&#x27;s first experiments, before he became focused on rice, were on the sweet potato (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;) and watermelons. Following Michurin&#x27;s theory, he grafted &quot;Ipomoea alba&quot; (a plant with high photosynthesis rate and high efficiency in starch production) onto sweet potatoes. These plants grew substantially larger tubers than those of plants without &quot;I. alba&quot; grafts. However, when he planted seeds from these grafted sweet potatoes for a second generation, the tubers were normal sized from seeds of the sweet potato part of the plant, while seeds from the &quot;I. alba&quot; part did not grow sweet potatoes. He continued with similar grafting experiments on other plants, but none of the plants produced offspring with any mixtures of the beneficial traits grafted into their parents. This was in contradiction to the expectations of Michurin&#x27;s theory. Yuan concluded, &quot;I had learned some background of Mendel and Morgan&#x27;s theory, and I knew from journal papers that it was proven by experiments and real agricultural applications, such as seedless watermelon. I desired to read more and learn more, but I can only do it secretly.&quot;

===Famine===
In 1959 China experienced the Great Chinese Famine. Yuan as an agricultural scientist could do little to greatly help people around him in Hunan province. &quot;There was nothing in the field because hungry people took away all the edible things they can find. They eat grass, seeds, fern roots, or even white clay at the very extreme.&quot; He remembered the sight of those who had starved to death all his life.
Yuan considered applying the inheritance rules onto sweet potatoes and wheat since their fast rate of growth made them the practical solutions for the famine. However, he realized that in Southern China sweet potato was never a part of the daily diet and wheat didn&#x27;t grow well in that area. Therefore, he turned his mind to rice.

===Heterosis===
Back in 1906, geneticist George Harrison Shull experimented with hybrid maize. He observed that inbreeding reduced vigor and yield among the offspring but crossbreeding did the opposite. Those experiments proved the concept of heterosis. In the 1950s, geneticist J. C. Stephens and a few others hybridized two sorghum varieties found in Africa to create high-yielding offspring. 
Those results were inspiring for Yuan. However, maize and sorghum reproduce mainly through cross-pollination, while rice is a self-pollinating plant, which would make any crossbreeding attempts difficult, for obvious reasons. In Edmund Ware Sinnott&#x27;s book Principles of Genetics, it clearly states that self-pollinating plants, like wheat and rice, have experienced long-term selection both by nature and by humans. Therefore, traits that were inferior were all excluded, and the remaining traits were all superior. He speculated that there would be no advantage in crossbreeding rice, and that the nature of self-pollination makes it hard to do cross breed experiments on rice on a large scale.

==Contributions==
Yuan was both professionally and personally interested in rice production. He spent a majority of his time in the field, rather than staying confined in a lab or publishing papers. As such, he played a large role in Chinese agriculture by mentoring and leading others in the field, which helped foster future achievements in Chinese agriculture.

In 1979, his technique for hybrid rice was introduced into the United States, making it the first case of intellectual property rights transfer in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 1991 statistics show that 20 percent of the world&#x27;s rice output came from 10 percent of the world&#x27;s rice fields that grow hybrid rice.

Yuan advocated for sharing the success of his breakthroughs with other nations. He and his team donated crucial rice strains to the International Rice Research Institute in 1980. These donated strains were used to create hybrid rice strains that could sustain and grow in tropical countries to help their food supply chains. In addition to donating important rice strains, Yuan and his team taught farmers in other countries to grow and cultivate hybrid rice.

At present, the annual planting area of hybrid rice in China is about 230 million acres, accounting for 50% of the total rice planting area, and the output accounts for 57% of the total rice production. This increases the country&#x27;s grain production by more than 20 billion kilograms every year, which is equivalent to the annual total grain production of a medium-sized province. Due to the great success of hybrid rice, he has won eight international awards, including the only National Special Invention Award and the UNESCO &quot;Science Award&quot;, and is known as the &quot;Father of Hybrid Rice&quot; internationally.

==Honors and awards==
Four asteroids and a college in China have been named after him. The minor planet 8117 Yuanlongping was also named after him.

For his achievement, Yuan was awarded the 2011 Mahathir Science Award. The award was presented by Malaysian former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Yuan won the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award of China in 2000, the Wolf Prize in Agriculture and the World Food Prize in 2004.

He was the Director-General of the China National Hybrid Rice R&amp;D Center and appointed Professor at Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha. He was a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2006) and the 2006 CPPCC.

Yuan worked as the chief consultant for the FAO in 1991.

==Personal life==
Yuan married one of his students, Deng Ze () in 1964. They had three sons, among them Yuan Ding&#x27;an () and Yuan Dingjiang ().

== Death ==
On March 10, 2021, Yuan Longping collapsed at his hybrid rice research base in Sanya. On April 7, he was transferred to Changsha, Hunan Province for treatment. At 13:07 on May 22, Yuan Longping died of multiple organ failure at () at the age of 90. Considered a national hero, tens of thousands of people sent flowers to the funeral home.

<text>Flickr ( ; ) is an image hosting and video hosting service, as well as an online community, founded in Canada and headquartered in the United States. It was created by Ludicorp in 2004 and was previously a common way for amateur and professional photographers to host high-resolution photos. It has changed ownership several times and has been owned by SmugMug since April 20, 2018.

 Flickr had a total of 112 million registered members and more than 3.5 million new images uploaded daily. On August 5, 2011, the site reported that it was hosting more than 6 billion images. In 2024, it was reported as having shared 10 billion photos and accepting 25 million per day.

Photos and videos can be accessed from Flickr without the need to register an account, but an account must be made to upload content to the site. Registering an account also allows users to create a profile page containing photos and videos that the user has uploaded and also grants the ability to add another Flickr user as a contact. For mobile users, Flickr has official mobile apps for iOS, Android, and an optimized mobile site.

==History==
Flickr was launched on February 10, 2004, by Ludicorp, a Vancouver-based company founded by Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake. The service emerged from tools originally created for Ludicorp&#x27;s &quot;Game Neverending&quot;, a web-based massively multiplayer online game. Flickr proved a more feasible project, and ultimately &quot;Game Neverending&quot; was shelved. Butterfield later launched a similar online game, &quot;Glitch&quot;, which was shut down on November 14, 2012.

Early versions of Flickr focused on a chat room called FlickrLive, with real-time photo exchange capabilities. The successive evolutions focused more on the uploading and filing back-end for individual users and the chat room was buried in the site map. It was eventually dropped as Flickr&#x27;s back-end systems evolved away from &quot;Game Neverending&quot;″s codebase. Key features of Flickr not initially present are tags, marking photos as favorites, group photo pools and interestingness, for which a patent was granted.

In addition to being a popular website for users to share and embed personal photographs and an online community, in 2004, the service was widely used by photo researchers and by bloggers to host images that they embed in blogs and social media.

Yahoo! acquired Ludicorp and Flickr on March 20, 2005. The acquisition reportedly cost between $22 million and $25 million. During the week of June 26, 2005 to July 2, 2005, all content was migrated from servers in Canada to servers in the United States, and all resulting data became subject to United States federal law. On May 3, 2007, Yahoo! announced that Yahoo! Photos would close down on September 20, 2007, after which all photos would be deleted; users were encouraged to migrate to Flickr. On January 31, 2007, Flickr announced that, to continue using the service, &quot;Old Skool&quot; members (those who had joined before the Yahoo! acquisition) would be required to associate their account with a Yahoo! identity by March 15, 2007. That move was criticized by some users.

Flickr upgraded its services from &quot;beta&quot; to &quot;gamma&quot; status on May 16, 2006, the changes attracted positive attention from Lifehacker. On December 13, 2006, upload limits on free accounts were increased to 100 MB a month (from 20 MB) and were removed from Flickr Pro accounts, which originally had a 2 GB per month limit. On April 9, 2008, Flickr began allowing paid subscribers to upload videos, limited to 90 seconds in length and 150 MB in size. On March 2, 2009, Flickr added the facility to upload and view HD videos, and began allowing free users to upload normal-resolution video. At the same time, the set limit for free accounts was lifted. In 2009, Flickr announced a partnership with Getty Images in which selected users could submit photographs for stock photography usage and receive payment. On June 16, 2010, this was changed so that users could label images as suitable for stock use themselves.

On May 20, 2013, Flickr launched the first stage of a major site redesign, introducing a &quot;Justified View&quot; close-spaced photo layout browsed via &quot;infinite scrolling&quot; and adding new features, including one terabyte of free storage for all users, a scrolling home page (mainly of contacts photos and comments) and updated Android app. The Justified View is paginated between 72 and 360 photos per page but unpaginated in search result presentation. &quot;Tech Radar&quot; described the new style Flickr as representing a &quot;sea change&quot; in its purpose. Many users criticized the changes, and the site&#x27;s help forum received thousands of negative comments. On March 25, 2014, Flickr&#x27;s New Photo Experience, a user interface redesign, left beta.

On May 7, 2015, Yahoo! overhauled the site, adding a revamped Camera Roll, a new way to upload photos, and upgraded the site&#x27;s apps. The new Uploadr application was made available for Macs, Windows and mobile devices.

In 2018, Yahoo! (owned by Verizon at that point) sold Flickr to SmugMug.

In early May 2019, SmugMug announced the migration of Flickr data, involving 100+ million accounts and billions of photos and videos, from the servers of former owner Yahoo! to Amazon Web Services (AWS), in a planned 12-hour transition to occur on May 22, 2019.

In May 2023, Flickr announced the development of the Print Shop feature that was being tested with a list of approved sellers. The Print shop feature allows photographers to sell prints via a storefront, and allows purchases from consumers. The feature was to allow only approved members access to it, but the criteria for that were yet to be announced.

===Corporate changes===
On June 13, 2008, Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield announced his resignation on July 12, 2008, which followed that of his wife and co-founder Caterina Fake, who left the company on the same day. Butterfield wrote a humorous resignation letter to Brad Garlinghouse.

On December 14, 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that three employees had been laid off as Yahoo! continued to reduce its workforce and, on November 30, 2010, &quot;CNET&quot; reported Yahoo! was on the verge of a major layoff, affecting 10% to 20% of its workforce. Flickr was specifically named as a target for these layoffs.

On June 13, 2017, Verizon Communications acquired Yahoo!, including Flickr. Verizon reorganized Yahoo!, along with AOL, into a new umbrella company, Oath, which was renamed as Verizon Media on January 8, 2019.

On April 20, 2018, SmugMug acquired Flickr from Verizon&#x27;s Oath and put an end to Flickr 1 TB storage plan for free users. Those users had until February 5, 2019, to convert to &quot;Pro&quot; accounts or their photo streams would be reduced to a maximum of 1,000 pictures. The deadline was later extended to March 12, 2019. The reasons cited were that the existing model was unsustainable by a medium-sized company which could not get revenues by selling profiles of the users. The sentiment was generally agreed on among the professionals. This policy, however, was never implemented and was abandoned in March, 2022 in favor of a policy that restricted content unless the user upgraded and paid for a Pro account.

==Features==
===Accounts===
Flickr has always offered two types of accounts: free and paid. Until January 7, 2019, free accounts had up to 1 TB of storage. On January 8, 2019, the account offerings changed. The free option is limited to 1,000 photos or videos stored, with videos limited to three minutes. After January 8, 2019, members over the limit could no longer upload new photos to Flickr. On February 5, 2019, a free account&#x27;s older content would be deleted automatically if it contains more than 1,000 photos and they do not subscribe to the paid service tier, with the exception of content that was already uploaded with a Creative Commons copyright license before November 1, 2018. 

The paid option features &quot;unlimited&quot; storage, advanced statistics, advertising-free browsing, videos up to 10 minutes in length, &quot;premier&quot; customer service, and promotional offers with other partners. 

In May 2011, Flickr added an option to easily reverse an account termination, motivated by the accidental deletion of a Flickr user&#x27;s account, and public reporting of its protracted restoration. Flickr may delete accounts without giving any reason or warning to the account&#x27;s owner.

As a result of the SmugMug buyout, Flickr added the ability for users to download all of their account data, such as photo albums, contacts, and comments.

===Organization===
The images a photographer uploads to Flickr go into their sequential &quot;photostream&quot;, the basis of a Flickr account. All photostreams can be displayed as a justified view, a slide show, a &quot;detail&quot; view or a date stamped archive. Clicking on a photostream image opens it in the interactive &quot;photopage&quot; alongside data, comments and facilities for embedding images on external sites.

Users may label their uploaded images with titles and descriptions, and images may be tagged, either by the uploader or by other users, if the uploader permits it. These text components enable computer searching of Flickr. Flickr was an early website to implement tag clouds, which were used until 2013, providing access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. Tagging was further revised in the photopage redesign of March 2014. Flickr has been cited as a prime example of effective use of folksonomy.

Users can organize their Flickr photos into &quot;albums&quot; (formerly &quot;sets&quot;) which are more flexible than the traditional folder-based method of organizing files, as one photo can belong to one album, many albums, or none at all. Flickr provides code to embed albums into blogs, websites and forums. Flickr albums represent a form of categorical metadata rather than a physical hierarchy. Geotagging can be applied to photos in albums, and any albums with geotagging can be related to a map using imapflickr. The resulting map can be embedded in a website. Flickr albums may be organized into &quot;collections&quot;, which can themselves be further organized into higher-order collections.

Organizr is a Web application for organizing photos within a Flickr account that can be accessed through the Flickr interface. It allows users to modify tags, descriptions and set groupings, and to place photos on a world map (a feature provided in conjunction with Yahoo! Maps). It uses Ajax to emulate the look, feel and quick functionality of desktop-based photo-management applications, such as Google&#x27;s Picasa and F-Spot. Users can select and apply changes to multiple photos at a time, as an alternative to the standard Flickr interface for editing.

===Access control===
Flickr provides both private and public image storage. A user uploading an image can set privacy controls that determine who can view the image. A photo can be flagged as either public or private. Private images are visible by default only to the uploader, but they can also be marked as viewable by friends or family. Privacy settings also can be decided by adding photographs from a user&#x27;s photostream to a &quot;group pool&quot;. If a group is private all the members of that group can see the photo. If a group is public the photo becomes public as well. Flickr also provides a &quot;contact list&quot; which can be used to control image access for a specific set of users in a way similar to that of LiveJournal. In November 2006, Flickr created a &quot;guest pass&quot; system that allows private photos to be shared with non-Flickr members. This setting allows sets or all photos under a certain privacy category (friends or family) to be shared. Many members allow their photos to be viewed by anyone, forming a large collaborative database of categorized photos. By default, other members can leave comments about any image they have permission to view and, in many cases, can add to the list of tags associated with an image.

===Interaction and compatibility===
The core functionality of the site relies on standard HTML and HTTP features, allowing for wide compatibility among platforms and browsers; Flickr&#x27;s functionality includes RSS and Atom feeds and an API that enables independent programmers to expand its services. This includes a large number of third-party Greasemonkey scripts that enhance and extend the functionality of Flickr. In 2006, Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts.org. Organizr and most of Flickr&#x27;s other text-editing and tagging interfaces use Ajax, with which most modern browsers are compliant. Images can be posted to the user&#x27;s photostream via email attachments, which enables direct uploads from many smartphones and applications. Flickr uses the Geo microformat on over three million geotagged images.

According to the company, Flickr is hosted on 62 databases across 124 servers, with about 800,000 user accounts per pair of servers. Based on information compiled by highscalability.com, the MySQL databases are hosted on servers that are Linux-based (from Red Hat), with a software platform that includes Apache, PHP (with PEAR and Smarty), shards, Memcached, Squid, Perl, ImageMagick and Java; the system administration tools include Ganglia, SystemImager, Subcon, and CVSup.

Signed-in Flickr users can &quot;Follow&quot; the Photostreams of other Flickr photographers. Reciprocating this process is optional. A user&#x27;s homepage contains a stream of their Contacts&#x27; photos at 2/3 screen size.

Groups are another major means of interaction with fellow members of Flickr around common photography interests. A Flickr Group can be started by any Flickr user, who becomes its administrator and can appoint moderators. Groups may either be open access or invitation-only, and most have an associated pool of photos. The administrator of the Flickr group can monitor and set restrictions for the group, assign awards to members, and may curate and organize the photo content. Recent uploads to a group will sometimes appear on its members&#x27; homepages. Group photo pools may be displayed in the &quot;Justified View&quot; or as a slideshow.

&quot;Galleries&quot; of photos from other photostreams may be curated by any signed-up Flickr user, provided the feature is not disabled by the photo&#x27;s uploader, these are then publicly viewable.

Any Flickr user can post comments to a Flickr photo on its photopage, unless this has been disabled by the uploader, and users can &quot;favorite&quot; a photo. A user&#x27;s favorites can be viewed in a justified or slideshow display.

Users of Windows Photo Gallery, Apple&#x27;s iPhoto (version 8), Adobe&#x27;s Lightroom 3.2, Apple&#x27;s Aperture (version 3.0), darktable, and digiKam have the ability to upload their photos directly to Flickr. They can also automatically update their status on other social networking services when they upload their images to Flickr. Flickr provides a desktop client for Mac OS X and Windows that allows users to upload photos without using the web interface. Uploadr allows drag-and-drop batch uploading of photos, the setting of tags and descriptions for each batch, and the editing of privacy settings.

Flickr has entered into partnerships with many third parties:

* Flickr had a partnership with the Picnik online photo-editing application that included a reduced-feature version of Picnik built into Flickr as a default photo editor. On April 5, 2012, Flickr replaced Picnik with Aviary as its default photo editor. 
* In addition to commercial mapping data, Flickr now uses OpenStreetMap mapping for various cities; this began with Beijing during the run-up to the 2008 Olympic games. , this is used for Baghdad, Beijing, Kabul, Sydney and Tokyo. OpenStreetMap data is collected by volunteers and is available under the Open Database License. 
* Flickr offers printing of various forms of merchandise, including business cards, photo books, stationery, personalized credit cards and large-size prints from companies such as Moo, Blurb, Tiny Prints, Capital One, Imagekind, and QOOP. 
* The Flickr partnership with Getty Images to sell stock photos from users is under review as of early 2014.

===Filtering===
In March 2007, Flickr added new content filtering controls that let members specify by default what types of images they generally upload (photo, art/illustration, or screenshot) and how &quot;safe&quot; (i.e., unlikely to offend others) their images are, as well as specify that information for specific images individually. Individual images are assigned to one of three categories: &quot;safe&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot;. Users can specify the same criteria when searching for images. There are some restrictions on searches for certain types of users: non-members must always use SafeSearch, which omits images noted as potentially offensive, while members whose Yahoo! accounts indicate that they are underage may use SafeSearch or moderate SafeSearch, but cannot turn SafeSearch off completely. The system achieves a fairly good separation of family-friendly photos and adult content; generic image searches normally produce no pornographic results, with the visibility of adult content restricted to users and dedicated Flickr communities who have opted into viewing it.

Flickr has used this filtering system to change the level of accessibility to &quot;unsafe&quot; content for entire nations, including South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany. In summer 2007, German users staged a &quot;revolt&quot; over being assigned the user rights of a minor. 

===Licensing===

Flickr offers users the ability to either release their images under certain common usage licenses or label them as &quot;all rights reserved&quot;. The licensing options primarily include the Creative Commons 2.0 attribution-based and minor content-control licenses – although jurisdiction and version-specific licenses cannot be selected. As with &quot;tags&quot;, the site allows easy searching of only those images that fall under a specific license.

On January 16, 2008, Flickr launched a program called &quot;The Commons on Flickr.&quot; Several international cultural institutions share images using a &quot;no known copyright restrictions&quot; through the program. According to Flickr, the goal of the program is to &quot;firstly show you hidden treasures in the world&#x27;s public photography archives, and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer.&quot; Participants include the National Museum of Denmark, Powerhouse Museum, George Eastman Museum, Library of Congress, Nationaal Archief, National Archives and Records Administration, National Library of Scotland, State Library of New South Wales, and Smithsonian Institution.

In May 2009, White House official photographer Pete Souza began using Flickr as a conduit for releasing White House photos. The photos were initially posted with a Creative Commons Attribution license requiring that the original photographers be credited. Flickr later created a new license which identified them as &quot;United States Government Work&quot;, which does not carry any copyright restrictions.

In March 2015, Flickr added the Creative Commons Public Domain Mark and Creative Commons Zero (CC0) to its licensing options. The Public Domain Mark is meant for images that are no longer protected by copyright. CC0 is used for works that are still protected by copyright or neighbouring rights, but where the rightsholders choose to waive all those rights.

==Reception==
Flickr became an immediate success and was seen as a successful example of &quot;Web 2.0&quot;, and a year later was purchased by Yahoo!. Initially, the site was most popular with professional photographers and graphic designers as well as bloggers who used it as an image repository. In 2007, Flickr was the 19th most popular website on the Internet according to its Alexa Rank. However, since then, its popularity has declined relative to social media platforms with photo sharing capabilities (such as Facebook and Instagram), as well as cloud file storage services (such as Dropbox). By 2021, Flickr&#x27;s Alexa Rank had declined significantly, yet indicated that the website was still among the top 500 most popular websites globally.

==Controversies==
===Censorship===
On June 12, 2007, in the wake of the rollout of localized language versions of the site, Flickr implemented a user-side rating system for filtering out potentially controversial photos. Simultaneously, users with accounts registered with Yahoo! subsidiaries in Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Korea were prevented from viewing photos rated &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;restricted&quot; on the three-part scale used. Many Flickr users, particularly in Germany, protested against the new restrictions, claiming unwanted censorship from Flickr and Yahoo.

Flickr management, unwilling to go into legal details, implied that the reason for the stringent filtering was some particularly strict age-verification laws in Germany. The issue received attention in the German national media, especially in online publications. Initial reports indicated that Flickr&#x27;s action was a sensible, if unattractive, precaution against prosecution, although later coverage implied that Flickr&#x27;s action may have been unnecessarily strict. On June 20, 2007, Flickr reacted by granting German users access to &quot;moderate&quot; (but not &quot;restricted&quot;) images, and hinted at a future solution for Germany, involving advanced age-verification procedures.

Since June 1, 2009, Flickr has been blocked in China in advance of the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

===Copyright enforcement===
Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy-handed implementation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA). Under OCILLA, a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable access to content as soon as they receive an official notice of infringement, to maintain protection from liability. After having one of his own pictures taken down following an incorrect DMCA claim, British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States or they were, but the person filing the notice of infringement was not, Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately. Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright, Flickr did not, according to Gorman, replace the deleted content. He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a counter-notice. Shortly afterward, Flickr changed its policy.

In 2019, Flickr added new theft detection tool options to certain users. Some subscribers will be provided &quot;copy-protection tools that can detect if their images have been used without permission,&quot; the BBC reported in 2019, noting &quot;Flickr Pro subscribers will be able to monitor up to 1,000 images and send automated copyright claims to people or companies that use their photos.&quot;

===Sale of Creative Commons-licensed photos===
In November 2014, Flickr announced that it would sell wall-sized prints of photos from the service that are licensed under Creative Commons licenses allowing commercial use. Although its use of the photos in this manner is legal and allowed under the licenses, Flickr was criticized by users for what they perceived to be unfair exploitation of artists&#x27; works, as all the profits from these offerings go to Yahoo! and are not shared with their respective photographers, and users were not given a means of opting-out from the program without placing their photos under a more restrictive non-commercial license. By contrast, a similar opt-in program for &quot;licensed&quot; photos does give photographers a 51% share of sales. On December 19, 2014, Flickr General Manager Bernardo Hernandez announced they would pull all Creative Commons-licensed images from the program and issue refunds, stating that &quot;Subsequently, we&#x27;ll work closely with Creative Commons to come back with programs that align better with our community values.&quot;

===Deletion of files of non-paying users===
On November 1, 2018, Flickr announced new restrictions for its users.
*On January 8, 2019, non-paying users would only able to upload up to 1000 files free of charge.
*Deletion of the oldest files, determined by the upload date, was scheduled to begin on March 12, 2019, until the limit of 1000 files was met. The size of the individual files would not be relevant. Alternatively, users could upgrade to Pro subscription for US$60 per year.
On March 17, 2022, Flickr revealed that it had not in fact deleted any photos for exceeding storage limits. However, it announced that it would soon implement a policy limiting the sharing of &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;restricted&quot; content to Pro users, and limiting free users to 50 &quot;non-public&quot; images. Images beyond these limits would be at risk for deletion.

<text>Stephen Herdsman (born October 6, 1974, in Kingston, Jamaica), is a former American soccer defender now coaching three-time national champion Midwest United FC of Grand Rapids, MI as well as Cornerstone University of the NAIA of Grand Rapids, MI.

==Career==
Herdsman played college soccer at Cornerstone University until 2000, while also playing in the Premier Development League with the West Michigan Edge.

Herdsman was drafted 17th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the Colorado Rapids. With his blazing speed, Herdsman earned a spot on the team as an outside back, starting 16 games for the Rapids as a rookie. He saw his playing time decline in 2002, however, starting only 9 games, although he started all five of the Rapids&#x27; playoff games. After playing in only three games in the 2003 season, however, Herdsman announced his retirement from professional soccer, reportedly due to personality conflicts with Rapids head coach Tim Hankinson. Steve also retired from the MLS because of an injury to his leg. Steve is now a Director with Midwest United FC.

After finishing the season with the West Michigan Edge, Herdsman&#x27;s rights were traded from the Rapids to the Columbus Crew, and he switched teams. Although he began the season as a starting outside back for the Crew, Herdsman lost his spot to Nelson Akwari and Chris Wingert, and ended the season having appeared in only eight games. After playing in just seven games in 2005, he was released.

In 2009, Herdsman signed with the Michigan Bucks of the USL Premier Development League.

In 2016, Herdsman was named in NPSL side Grand Rapids FC&#x27;s roster, but did not appear once.

<text>The Ferrari Daytona is a two-seat grand tourer produced by Ferrari from 1968 to 1973. It was introduced at the Paris Auto Salon in 1968 to replace the 275 GTB/4, and featured the 275&#x27;s Colombo V12 with a larger cylinder bore for . It was offered in berlinetta and spyder forms. The car came in two variants: the 365 GTB/4 coupe, and the 365 GTS/4 convertible.

The Daytona was succeeded by the mid-engined 365 GT4 Berlinetta Boxer in 1973.


==Name==
The unofficial Daytona name is reported to have been applied by the media rather than Ferrari and commemorates Ferrari&#x27;s 1-2-3 finish in the February 1967 24 Hours of Daytona with a 330 P3/4, a 330 P4 and a 412 P. To this day, Ferrari itself only rarely refers to the 365 as the &quot;Daytona&quot;, and refers to it as an &quot;unofficial&quot; name.

==Specifications==
Unlike Lamborghini&#x27;s then-new, mid-engined Miura, the Daytona was a traditional front-engined, rear-drive car. The engine, known as the &quot;Tipo 251&quot; and developed from the earlier &quot;Colombo&quot; V12 with a 60° bank angle used in the 275 GTB/4, was a DOHC 2 valves per cylinder , per cylinder, bore x stroke , featuring 6X2 barrel 40 DCN/20 Weber carburetors (40 mm Solex twin carburettors were used alternatively). At a compression ratio of 9.3:1, it produced at 7500 rpm and a maximum torque of at 5500 rpm, could reach . 0- acceleration was just 5.4 seconds. For the American version, slight modifications were made—the compression ratio was reduced to 8.8:1 and the exhaust system was equipped with a large central silencer, necessitating visible alterations to the primary pipes.

The five-speed manual transmission (of the transaxle concept) was mounted in the rear for optimal weight distribution, and a four-wheel independent suspension featured wishbones and coil springs.

==Styling==
Pininfarina designer Leonardo Fioravanti, who had previously worked on the Dino Ferrari&#x27;s styling, was responsible for the 365 GTB/4. It reflected a movement from Ferrari&#x27;s traditional rounded designs to a more contemporary, sharp-edged look.

Early Daytonas featured fixed headlights behind an acrylic glass cover. A new U.S. safety regulation banning headlights behind covers resulted in retractable pop-up twin headlights in 1971.

==Model variations==
===365 GTB/4 and GTS/4===
The generally accepted total number of Daytonas from the Ferrari club historians is 1,406 over the life of the model. This figure includes 156 UK right-hand-drive coupés, 122 factory-made spyders (of which 7 are right hand drive), and 15 competition cars. The competition cars are divided into three series, all with modified lightweight bodies and in various degrees of engine tune. All bodies except the first Pininfarina prototype were produced by Italian coachbuilder Scaglietti, which already had a well established record of working with Ferrari.

Historically, and especially since the mid-1980s and early 1990s, there has mostly been a considerable market price difference between a real berlinetta and a real spyder. Many berlinettas were turned into spyders by aftermarket mechanics, often to increase the car&#x27;s monetary value or simply because of the owner&#x27;s preference for an open car. Differences in value have typically remained, however, even after the most skillful conversions.

== Coachbuilt derivatives ==
=== 365 GTB/4 Shooting Brake ===
The stock 365 GTB/4 was delivered new to Philadelphia-area Ferrari dealer Chinetti-Garthwaite Motors as the 805th 365 GTB/4 produced with chassis no. 15275. It was there that architect Bob Gittleman asked Luigi Chinetti Jr. to design a unique car for him. Mr. Chinetti had already designed a Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 modified by Vignale and decided to design a shooting brake. The car was then sent to Surrey in England where Panther Westwinds built the car according to Mr. Chinetti&#x27;s designs. The car was listed at Gooding and Co&#x27;s 2016 Pebble Beach auction with less than 4,500 miles and an $750,000 - $1,000,000 estimate. The car didn&#x27;t sell then.

==Competition versions==
The first racing version of the 365GTB/4 was prepared in 1969: an aluminium bodied car was built and entered in the Le Mans 24-hour race that year (the car crashed in practice). Ferrari did not produce an official competition car until late in 1970.

The official cars were built in three batches of five cars each, in 1970–1, 1972 and 1973. They all featured a lightweight body making use of aluminium and fibreglass panels, with plexiglas windows. The engine was unchanged from the road car in the first batch of competition cars, but tuned in the latter two batches (to in 1972 and then around in 1973).

The cars were not raced by the official Scuderia Ferrari team, but by a range of private entrants. They enjoyed particular success in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with results including a 5th overall in 1971, followed by GT class wins in 1972, 1973 and 1974. In 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4s took the first 5 places of the GT class.

The final major success of the car was in 1979 (five years after production ended), when a 1973 car achieved a class victory (2nd overall) in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

==Legacy==
In 1971, the Daytona gained fame when one was driven by Dan Gurney and Brock Yates in the inaugural Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. Showcasing the car&#x27;s potential for sustained high speed travel, the pair won with an average speed of , completing the distance from New York City to L.A.——in 35 hours 54 minutes. Gurney was later quoted as saying &quot;We never once exceeded 175 miles per hour.&quot;

It appears on the cover of 1973&#x27;s &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;, the fifth studio album of the American pop band The Carpenters.

It is driven (and crashed) by the &quot;Kris Kristofferson&quot; character in the 1976 version of the movie &quot;A Star is Born&quot;.

A Ferrari Daytona is used in an &quot;Across America&quot; race by the team of Steve Smith (Tim McIntire) and Franco Bertollini (Raul Julia) in the 1976 movie, &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;

In the 1980s, a Daytona replica was prominently featured on the first two seasons of NBC&#x27;s hit television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The black car seen in early episodes was a kit car built on a Corvette C3 chassis. Altogether, two nearly identical cars were used simultaneously in the production of the TV series. Ferrari was not pleased that its company and one of their products was represented on TV by an imitation car and sued the manufacturer of the kit for trademark infringement and trademark dilution. The Daytona replicas were retired at the beginning of the show&#x27;s third season and replaced by two Ferrari-donated Testarossas, the company&#x27;s newest flagship model at the time.

In 2004, the Daytona was voted top sports car of the 1970s by &quot;Sports Car International&quot; magazine. Similarly, &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; named the 365 GTB/4 and GTS/4 as number two in their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.
In 2024, Ferrari unveiled the Ferrari 12Cilindri, the design of which was a tribute to the 365 GTB/4 Daytona.

<text>William Kirk English (January 27, 1929July 26, 2020) was an American computer engineer who contributed to the development of the computer mouse while working for Douglas Engelbart at SRI International&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center. He would later work for Xerox PARC and Sun Microsystems.

==Early life==
English was born on January 27, 1929, in Lexington, Kentucky. The only son of Harry English and Caroline (Gray) English, he had two half-brothers from his father&#x27;s previous marriage. Harry English was an electrical engineer who managed coal mines and Caroline was a homemaker. William, or Bill as he was known, attended a boarding school in Arizona and then studied electrical engineering at the University of Kentucky.

==Career==
English served in the US Navy until the late 1950s, including postings in northern California and Japan. He then joined the Stanford Research Institute in the 1960s to work on magnets, and built one of the first all-magnetic arithmetic units with Hewitt Crane. In 1964, he was the first person to join Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s lab, the Augmentation Research Center.
He and Douglas Engelbart share credit for creating the first computer mouse in 1963; English built the initial prototype, and was its first user, based on Engelbart&#x27;s notes. English led a 1965 project, sponsored by NASA, which evaluated the best way to select a point on a computer display; the mouse was the winner. English was also instrumental at The Mother of All Demos in 1968, which showcased the mouse and other technologies developed as part of their NLS (oN-Line System). In particular, English figured out how to connect a terminal in the San Francisco Civic Auditorium to the host computer at SRI away, and also transmitted audio and video between the locations.

He left SRI in 1971 and went to Xerox PARC, where he managed the Office Systems Research Group. While working at PARC, English developed a ball mouse, in which a ball replaced the original set of wheels. It worked similarly to a moveable ball-based mouse device called Rollkugel, which had been developed by Telefunken, Germany, and was offered since 1968 as input device for their computers.

In 1989, he went to work for Sun Microsystems on internationalization efforts.

English died of respiratory failure in San Rafael, California, on July 26, 2020, aged 91.

<doc id="1178489" wikidata="Q3638666" url="?curid=1178489" title="Bernard DeVoto">
<text>Bernard Augustine DeVoto (January 11, 1897 – November 13, 1955) was an American historian, conservationist, essayist, columnist, teacher, editor, and reviewer. He was the author of a series of Pulitzer-Prize-winning popular histories of the American West and for many years wrote &quot;The Easy Chair&quot;, an influential column in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. DeVoto also wrote several well-regarded novels and during the 1950s served as a speech-writer for Adlai Stevenson. His friend and biographer, Wallace Stegner described DeVoto as &quot;flawed, brilliant, provocative, outrageous, ... often wrong, often spectacularly right, always stimulating, sometimes infuriating, and never, never dull.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

DeVoto was born on January 11, 1897, in Ogden, Utah to Florian and Rhoda DeVoto. DeVoto&#x27;s father was a Catholic of Italian descent, an educated, impoverished man; his mother was the daughter of a Mormon farmer; and their son was not accepted by either community. DeVoto attended Ogden High School and worked briefly at the &quot;Ogden Standard&quot; after graduating. He attended the University of Utah for one year, then transferred to Harvard University, entering as a member of the class of 1918. He interrupted his education to serve in the Army in World War I, then returned to school and graduated in 1920.

==Career==
DeVoto began his career in 1922 as an English instructor at Northwestern University. He also began publishing articles and novels (under the pseudonyms &quot;John August&quot; and &quot;Cady Hewes&quot;). In 1927 he resigned from Northwestern. He and his wife Avis moved to Massachusetts in order to attempt to earn his living from writing along with part-time instructing at Harvard University. (His ambition of attaining a permanent position at Harvard was never realized.) He also edited the &quot;Harvard Graduates&#x27; Magazine&quot; from 1930 to 1932. A series of articles he published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; is credited with bringing the influential work of Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto to wide audiences. This led to a regular &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; column, &quot;The Easy Chair,&quot; which DeVoto wrote from 1935 until his death.

DeVoto was also an authority on Mark Twain and served as a curator and editor for Twain&#x27;s papers; this work culminated in several publications, including the best-selling &quot;Letters From the Earth&quot;, which appeared only in 1962. From 1936 to 1938, he worked in New York City, where he was editor of the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, after which he returned to Massachusetts.

It was during his tenure as editor of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; that DeVoto produced one of his most controversial pieces, &quot;Genius is Not Enough,&quot; a scathing review of Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a Novel&quot;, in which the novelist recounted his method of writing his autobiographical &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, as essentially submitting undigested first drafts to be transformed into finished work by others. According to DeVoto, Wolfe&#x27;s writing was &quot;hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by [his editor] Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.&quot; Although in passing acknowledging Wolfe&#x27;s genius, DeVoto excoriated his lack of artistry, &quot;Mr. Wolfe ... has written some of the finest fiction in our day. But a great part of what he writes is not fiction at all: it is only material with which he has struggled but which has defeated him... Until Mr. Wolfe develops more craftsmanship, he will not be the important novelist he is now widely accepted as being.&quot; DeVoto&#x27;s essay was a decisive factor in Wolfe&#x27;s subsequent cutting ties with Scribners and editor Maxwell Perkins shortly before his death in 1938 and had a devastating effect on Wolfe&#x27;s posthumous literary reputation.

The decade between 1943 and 1953 saw the completion of what John L. Thomas called DeVoto&#x27;s &quot;magnificent trilogy of the discovery, settling, and exploitation of the West&quot;: &quot;The Year of Decision: 1846&quot; (1943); &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; (1947); &quot;The Course of Empire&quot; (1952). &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; was the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for History and the inaugural Bancroft Prize in 1948 and &quot;The Course of Empire&quot; received National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1953. DeVoto was the first Utahn to win a Pulitzer. He also edited a selection of &quot;The Journals of Lewis and Clark&quot; (1953). A book on the history, geography, and ecology of the American West remained unfinished at his death in 1955; in 2001, an edited version was published as &quot;Western Paradox&quot;.

==Accusations of Communism==
As early as 1938, when the Dies Committee was investigating radical professors and a Soviet takeover of America, DeVoto &quot;mocked the conspiracy nuts&quot; and yet was called &quot;fascist&quot; by the liberal critics. In the 1950s, he felt &quot;a Communist or two on any faculty constituted a far smaller danger than the procedures that would be necessary to keep them off.&quot; He also opposed the outlawing of the Communist Party USA. &quot;Historian Bernard DeVoto spoke for many liberals&quot; in disdaining &quot;the prominence ex-communists had gained in public life during the Cold War.&quot; He argued that despite the new-found patriotism of conservative ex-Communists, their commitments to absolutism and authoritarianism remained the same and continued to threaten freedom.

In April 1953, DeVoto&#x27;s &quot;Easy Chair&quot; column criticized &quot;The Case of the Censorious Congressman&quot; during Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and House Un-American Activities Committeehearings of teachers. U.S. Representative Carroll D. Kearns called DeVoto &quot;pro-Communist.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
DeVoto married Avis DeVoto (1904–1989), a book reviewer, editor, and avid cook. She became friends with Julia Child. Child had written a fan letter to Bernard DeVoto regarding an article of his in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; he had said that he detested stainless steel knives, and she thought he was &quot;100% right&quot;. Avis&#x27; response began a long correspondence and friendship between the two women during Child&#x27;s work on her groundbreaking &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; (1961). Child acknowledged Avis as &quot;wet nurse&quot; and &quot;mentor&quot; to the undertaking. The DeVotos&#x27; son Mark (b. 1940) is a music theorist, composer, and retired professor at Tufts University. Their older son Gordon, a writer, died in 2009.

DeVoto died on November 13, 1955 at age 58.

<text>Cát Tiên National Park () is a national park located in the south of Vietnam, in the provinces of Đồng Nai, Bình Phước and Lâm Đồng. It is approximately 150 km north of Ho Chi Minh City. It has an area of about 720 km2 and protects one of the largest areas of lowland tropical forests left in Vietnam.
Since 2011, Cát Tiên National Park has been a part of Đồng Nai Biosphere Reserve.

==History==
The surrounding area was originally occupied by the Ma people – especially in the area that is now Cat Loc (in the 1960s eastern Nam Cat Tien was described as &quot;inhabité&quot; [&#x27;uninhabited&#x27;]) – and Stieng people in western Dong Nai Province. After the formation of the park, many of these people were re-settled in Talai village, to the south-west of Nam Cat Tien.

Cát Tiên National Park (CTNP) was protected initially in 1978 as two sectors, Nam Cat Tien and Tay Cat Tien. Another sector, Cat Loc, was gazetted as a rhinoceros reserve in 1992 upon the discovery of a population of the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros, an occasion that brought the park into the world&#x27;s eye. The three areas were combined to form one park in 1998. Nam Cat Tien is contiguous with Vĩnh Cửu nature reserve thus providing an enlarged area for species to breed. The forest is now protected by the &quot;Kiểm lâm&quot; (VN Forest Rangers) with responsibilities for managing poaching, fire control, and other issues.

Parts of the park area suffered historically during the Vietnam War when it was extensively sprayed with defoliant herbicides. However, substantial further damage was done by logging up until the 1990s. To this day these areas have extensive bamboo and grassland cover and trees have not yet grown back.

==Archaeology==
The Cát Tiên archaeological site is located just outside the park boundary on the northern bank of the Dong Nai river (between Cat Loc and Nam Cat Tien, facing towards the latter). Excavations carried out between 1994 and 2003 revealed a group of temples, belonging to a previously unknown Shaiva Hindu civilization which probably inhabited the area between the 4th century and 9th centuries AD (possibly later). A large number of gold, bronze, ceramic, coloured stone, and glass artefacts are currently displayed in the Da Lat museum.

==Habitats and flora==

Cát Tiên National Park (CTNP) consists of seasonal tropical forests, grasslands and riparian areas, with Park Authorities identifying five major habitat types as follows:

1. Primary evergreen forest areas perhaps comprise only about 2% of the Nam Cat Tien area; can be highly diverse but are dominated by trees in two families (for other Families and Species see below):
* Fabaceae: &quot;Afzelia xylocarpa&quot; (Caesalpinoidea) and rosewoods (Papilionoideae): including the endemic &quot;Dalbergia mammosa&quot;.
* Dipterocarpaceae: notably &quot;Dipterocarpus alatus&quot;, which occurs naturally, but with a good survival rate, it is widely used for replanting; &quot;Hopea odorata&quot; is also used for replanting.

2. Primary and secondary mixed or deciduous forest (dry season):
Where soils are well-drained the following trees are common:
* &quot;Lagerstroemia calyculata&quot; (Lythraceae),
* &quot;Tetrameles nudiflora&quot; (Tetramelaceae), of there are spectacularly large specimen trees,
* &quot;Anogeissus acuminata&quot; (Combretaceae).
The abundance &quot;L. calyculata&quot; is discussed by Blanc et al. especially as an indicator of secondary forest. &quot;It appears to be a very good competitive species able to regenerate on denuded areas: along roads and on land abandoned after cultivation. Human disturbances have mostly affected Dipterocarpaceae for resin and Fabaceae for their wood.&quot;

The low canopy and under-story zones contains species such as the endemic &quot;Cycas inermis&quot;; a number of palms are common, including &quot;Caryota mitis&quot;, &quot;Licuala&quot; and &quot;Pinanga&quot; spp., together with a wide range of fruit species (important food for animals) such as figs (&quot;e.g. Ficus racemosa&quot;) and wild bananas (&quot;Musa acuminata&quot;).
3. Secondary forest with abundant bamboo species: this due to human activity, the forest having been degraded by logging, forest fires and in some areas war-time defoliants, which have caused the forest canopy to be replaced with bamboos. Common trees include &quot;Lagerstroemia calyculata&quot;, &quot;Mesua&quot; sp. and &quot;Xylia xylocarpa&quot;, with bamboo species present.

4. Bamboo forest (some 40% of the park area) may also have been affected by human activity, including areas where forest was previously cleared for subsistence agriculture creating favourable conditions for bamboos; species include: &quot;Bambusa balcooa&quot;, &quot;B. procera&quot;, and &quot;Gigantochloa&quot; spp.

5. Seasonally flooded grasslands: CTNP has substantial (approximately 10%) area of grassland (including disused farmland) and wetlands
* In the rainy season, Dong Nai river water floods into an area of 2,500 ha area of northern Nam Cat Tien, along the Da Kluo which is a reverse flow stream (like Tonlé Sap) replenishing the lakes: Bau Sau (crocodile lake), Bau Chim, Bau Co and the surrounding grasslands. 
* In the flat eastern half of Nam Cat Tien especially, there are a number of swamps (see above) surrounding isolated, poorly-drained small open areas – typically 3–10 ha – that might best be described as wet meadows – that are often surrounded with swamp forest and may also contain vernal pools.

===Lianas and epiphytes===
As in most seasonal tropical forests the park has an abundance of epiphytes (such as ferns, orchids and &#x27;ant plants&#x27; such as &quot;Myrmecodia&quot;). Lianas are abundant and include:
&quot;Ancistrocladus tectorius&quot;, box beans: &quot;Entada&quot; spp., &#x27;monkey ladders&#x27;: &quot;Lasiobema scandens&quot; and Rattans: especially &quot;Calamus&quot; spp. in wet areas.

=== Riparian areas ===
In flat lowland areas and especially along streams, areas of freshwater swamp forest notable tree species often include: &quot;Ficus benjamina&quot;, &quot;Livistona saribus&quot;, &quot;Crateva&quot;, &quot;Syzygium&quot; and &quot;Horsfieldia&quot; spp. Naturally occurring patches of &quot;Bambusa blumeana&quot; (&quot;tre gai&quot; or &quot;tre la ngà&quot;) are also abundant in riparian areas and flooding forest. Other plants include &quot;Schumannianthus dichotomus&quot; (&quot;cool mat&quot;) which occurs in muddy areas along streams.

=== Scientific and conservation activities ===

Numerous endemic species, having their type locality at CTNP, have been described by Vietnamese and international scientists: including those at the Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre. More than 20 species of organisms have the name &quot;catienensis&quot; or similar, including two palms (&quot;Licuala&quot; illustrated here), the bracket fungus &quot;Tomophagus cattienensis&quot;, two reptiles and four insects to date.

Between the park headquarters and Ta Lai village there are substantial replanting areas, including a 200 ha area supported by European Community between 1996 and 1998.

===Invertebrates===
The most developed insect lists currently cover ants, butterflies, dragonflies, mosquitoes and termites; of the latter, &quot;Macrotermes&quot; spp. have an important ecological role, with large colony mounds very commonly encountered in the forest.

In 2007, the velvet-worm &quot;Eoperipatus totoro&quot; was discovered in the Crocodile Lake area by scientists of the Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre.

==Threats==
Cat Tien comprises an important reserve in Vietnam, both for the habitat it protects and the number of species it contains. Although the population of the Javan rhinoceros went into extinction, it is still home to 40 IUCN Red List species, and protects around 30% of Vietnam&#x27;s species. The park is, however, threatened by encroachment from local communities, illegal logging and poaching. In addition, the park is too small for the larger species found inside it. This has led to either their local extinction or conflict with local people as these animals move beyond the confines of the park. This problem is particularly intense for the park&#x27;s elephant population, which is prone to wandering and is considered too small to be self sustainable.

Since the early 1990s, partly as a result of the discovery of rhinos in the park, international donors and the Vietnamese government began to invest more money in protecting the park and managing the resources of local State Forest Enterprises, nearby and adjoining forests (including Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve), in co-ordination with the park as a whole. There have been moves to combine a management plan that allows for both traditional park management and some limited resource utilisation by local people, which include the Stieng, Chau Ma (now concentrated in Ta Lai) and Cho&#x27;ro minorities.

In 2008 the Forestry Protection Department collaborating with the Endangered Asian Species Trust (UK), Monkey World Ape Rescue (UK) and Pingtung Wildlife Rescue Centre (Taiwan) founded the Dao Tien Endangered Primate Species Centre. The centre focusses on the rescue, rehabilitation and release of the four endangered primates found in Cat Tien (golden-cheeked gibbon, black-shanked douc, pygmy loris and silvered langur), developing Government guidelines for release of primates. The centre conducts informative daily educational tours explaining the centre&#x27;s work, with a chance to see young rehabilitated gibbons in the trees.

<text>Seth Trembly (born March 21, 1982) is a former American soccer defensive midfielder.

Trembly was part of the original 1999 class at the Bradenton Academy, where, as part of the Under-17 United States national team, he trained with Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Bobby Convey, as well as his future teammates at the Rapids, Kyle Beckerman and Jordan Cila.

Rather than go to college, Trembly signed a Project 40 contract with MLS, and was allocated to his hometown team, the Colorado Rapids, joining the club at the end of the 1999 season. In 2000, he played twelve games with the MLS Pro-40 team. In his first four years, Trembly appeared in a total of 12 games for the Rapids, starting one. He at last began to break into the team in 2003, when injuries gave him the opportunity to play in 16 games, starting 11, for the team; he registered a goal and an assist. In 2004, he was largely a late defensive substitute, appearing in 24 games, but starting five, playing mostly as a defensive midfielder, but some as an outside back. The Rapids traded Trembly to Salt Lake in early 2005. He scored two goal in his first season with Real Salt Lake, but did not play a minute in 2006 because of two tears to his ACL. Although he was not able to play he did put his recovery time to good use, putting on a benefit concert for Right to Play, a charity that works to bring soccer to kids in Africa. He received the reward of Humanitarian of the Year. He signed a contract with the Montreal Impact in the United Soccer Leagues for the 2007 season.

In 2017, Trembly was hired as an assistant coach for the women&#x27;s soccer team at Utah Valley University.
