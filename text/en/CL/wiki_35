<text>William Meade (November 11, 1789March 14, 1862) was an American Episcopal bishop, the third Bishop of Virginia.

==Early life==
His father, Colonel Richard Kidder Meade (1746–1805), one of George Washington&#x27;s aides during the American Revolutionary War, after the conflict ended sold his estate at Coggins Point on the James River near Henricus and bought 1000 acres and moved the family to the Shenandoah Valley. Thus, William Meade was born on November 11, 1789, at &#x27;Meadea&#x27; in White Post, then grew up at Lucky Hit plantation, originally in Frederick County but now located in Clarke County, Virginia. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Meade was home-schooled until he was ten, then sent to a school run by Rev. Wiley on the estate of Nathaniel Burwell. Rather than attend the College of William and Mary in Virginia, which some considered irreligious by the time, young Meade and his fellow student William H. Fitzhugh entered the college of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1806. Meade graduated with high honors and as valedictorian in 1808.

At the urging of his mother and his cousin Mrs. Custis, Meade studied theology privately under the Rev. Walter Addison near the newly established national capital, and lived for a time in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Rev. Addison&#x27;s parish. He was particularly impressed by Soame Jenyns &quot;Internal Evidence of Christianity&quot; and William Wilberforce&#x27;s &quot;Practical View.&quot; Meade also returned to Princeton in 1809 to continue some graduate studies in divinity (since it had been organized by the Presbyterian Church), but caught a near-fatal fever, and so returned home to work on the farm as well as to build his own Shenandoah valley home at &quot;Mountain View&quot; (an estate which remains today, although no longer in Meade family ownership).

==Family==
Since this Meade later published genealogies of Virginia families, and in one pamphlet distinguished the Episcopal Church from the &quot;Romish,&quot; he acknowledged the first of his ancestors to arrive in America was Andrew Meade, a Roman Catholic who emigrated to New York and married Quaker Mary Latham of Flushing. The couple moved to what was then Nansemond County, Virginia, where great-grandfather Meade &quot;abjured his allegiance to the Roman Church,&quot; became a vestryman of the Suffolk Church, and briefly represented the county in the House of Burgesses (the forerunner to the Virginia General Assembly, in which his grandson David and great-grandson Andrew would also serve). His son David married a daughter of North Carolina&#x27;s last proprietary Governor, Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet, who could trace descent from Richard Kidder, Bishop of Bath and Wells. One of their sons, Richard Kidder Meade (born 1746), married Jane Randolph, daughter of Richard Randolph of Curles, whom the family noted was a descendant of Pocahontas as well as grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke. However, they had no children before Jane died. After the Revolutionary war, in 1780, Col. R.K. Meade married again, to Mary Randolph, the daughter of Benjamin Grymes and widow of William Randolph of Chatsworth, who bore him four daughters and four sons, including the future bishop.

Young William Meade married Mary, daughter of his Frederick County neighbor and lay reader Philip Nelson, on January 31, 1810. She bore his three sons before dying on July 3, 1817, and was buried at Old Chapel, as later would their sons Philip Nelson Meade (1811–1873) and Francis Burwell Meade (1815–1886). Three years after her death, on December 16, 1820, William Meade remarried, to Thomasia, daughter of Thomas Nelson of Yorktown and Hanover, who zealously assisted him in his ministry for two decades before dying on May 20, 1836. She was buried at Fork Church in Hanover County. Bishop Meade&#x27;s middle son, Richard Kidder Meade (1812–1892) became a clergyman, as did five of his grandsons.

==Ministry==
The elderly bishop James Madison of Virginia ordained Meade as a deacon on February 24, 1811. Meade afterward recalled that the congregation consisted of fifteen gentlemen and three ladies, almost all of them his relatives, and that on the way to Bruton Church many more gun-toting students and hunting dogs had passed them. When Meade traveled back through Richmond, the newly ordained deacon noted that the city&#x27;s only church St. John&#x27;s was only open for communion occasions, and that the Episcopalian Dr. Buchanan and Presbyterian Dr. Blair alternated Sundays. Bishop Madison died about a year later, and at least two men declined offers to become his successor.

After the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1786 was found legal by Virginia&#x27;s highest court in 1803, the new Episcopal Church, which had over 180 priests at the start of the Revolutionary War, was desperately short of ministers. By 1811, with Bishop Madison very infirm, no one from Virginia attended the General Convention. The following year Meade and several other prominent Virginians convinced William Holland Wilmer of Chestertown, Maryland, to move to Alexandria and the new national capital to serve as rector at St. Paul&#x27;s Church after the newly ordained deacon Meade tried to serve those parishioners&#x27; needs as well as those of Alexandria&#x27;s older parish for several months despite their significant distance down the Lord Fairfax Highway from his family&#x27;s preferred home.

Only seven Virginia priests (including Meade and Wilmer) gathered for the second diocesan convocation to select Madison&#x27;s successor, many fewer than the priests and laity (led by Carter Braxton) who had gathered in 1805 and declined their Bishop Madison&#x27;s request to appoint an assistant for him (with rights of succession). Finally, Meade, Wilmer and several other prominent Episcopalians convinced Richard Channing Moore to move to Richmond, Virginia, to become rector of Monumental Church (a significant parish then being built as a memorial to those who died in a disastrous theater fire), and Moore in due course became bishop Madison&#x27;s successor. Bishop Thomas John Claggett ordained Meade as a priest in 1814.

From his ordination until 1821, deacon and then Rev. Meade served as the assistant to Rev. Alexander Balmain, rector of Frederick Parish and who usually served in Winchester, Virginia, about 15 miles away from Meade&#x27;s home. Meade normally officiated every other Sunday at the Old Chapel near his family&#x27;s plantations. On the alternate Sundays, his father in law served as the parish&#x27;s lay leader, while Rev. Meade visited other congregations nearby or more remotely. After Rev. Balmaine died, Meade took on assistants who served at Winchester and Wickliffe, until those parishes were separated from Frederick Parish. Meade also remained as rector after his consecration as assistant bishop as discussed below, in part because his predecessors all kept other positions.

Meade also continued manual labor on his farm, and had specifically sought assurances from Bishop Madison before ordination that such work would not violate a longstanding church canon against servile labor, for Meade firmly believed sloth had helped all but destroy the Church of Virginia. He also home-taught his sons and nephew, both in scholarly work and manual labor. Later, Meade became known for his forays throughout Virginia, especially by horse even during severe weather, preaching among diverse parishes, until he ceded to old age and used a carriage (which some joked dated from his father&#x27;s service with General Washington).

In 1818, Meade and Wilmer helped organize an education society in Alexandria. Five years later, after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a seminary in Williamsburg, both helped form the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria to train young men for the ministry in Maryland, Virginia and southern states. Meade also supported the American Tract Society, and the Bible Society, except as the former grew to support abolitionism, as discussed below. Later, from 1842 to 1862, bishop Meade served as the seminary&#x27;s president, as well as delivered an annual course of lectures on pastoral theology. Meade also helped found the Evangelical Knowledge Society (1847) and served as its president. That organization opposed what it considered the heterodoxy of many of the books published by the Sunday School Union, and attempted to displace them by issuing works of a more evangelical type.

==Episcopate==
In 1829, after Wilmer&#x27;s unexpected death and as Bishop Moore approached retirement, Meade became assistant Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia. Three years earlier, he had refused suggestions that he apply to become the now-elderly Bishop William White&#x27;s assistant in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. Nonetheless, Bishop White led several other bishops who gathered at St. James&#x27; Church in Philadelphia during Meade&#x27;s consecration as Bishop Moore&#x27;s assistant.

The new suffragan&#x27;s first official act, on October 30, 1829, was consecrating a new building for Christ Church in Winchester. Meade then began an extensive visitation of the diocese, which took him to Martinsburg, then through the Shenandoah valley (Woodstock, Harrisonburg, and Staunton) before conducting Christmas services in Halifax and returning north to Alexandria. In 1832, Meade traveled across the Appalachian mountains for visitations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He also served as rector of Christ Church, Norfolk in 1834–1836, which may have prompted Meade to resign as rector of his home Cunningham Chapel parish (Rev. Stringfellow succeeded him for five years, followed by several longer-serving rectors). Rt. Rev. Meade thus became the first Virginia bishop to hold his position full-time, without concurrent responsibilities for an individual parish (as had bishop Moore with Monumental Church) or institution (as had bishop Madison with the College of William and Mary). In 1841, Meade traveled to London and met the future archbishop of Canterbury J.B. Sumner, among others.

When Bishop Moore died later that year, Meade succeeded him as Bishop of Virginia, and soon consecrated Maryland native John Johns as his assistant (and successor more than two decades later). Whereas the diocese had 44 clergy serving 40 parishes and 1,1462 communicants when Meade was consecrated as suffragan, the numbers had risen to 87 clergy serving 99 parishes and 3,702 communicants by the year Bishop Moore died, and 116 clergy serving 123 parishes and 7,876 communicants by 1860.

A low Churchman, Meade believed in evangelism and missionary work. He preached the gospel of Christ Crucified like some of his Presbyterian neighbors. Unlike his neighboring bishops Whittingham of Maryland and Ravenscroft and Ives of North Carolina, Meade opposed the Oxford Movement as too &quot;Romish&quot; (particularly after Rt.Rev. Ives&#x27; conversion to Catholicism in 1855). Rt.Rev. Meade especially objected to doctrines of transubstantiation and prayers for the dead, which he thought inconsistent with salvation through grace. As bishop Meade actively participated in several episcopal disciplinary cases against high churchmen: against Bishop Henry Onderdonk (1789–1858) of Pennsylvania (who because of intemperance was forced to resign and temporarily suspended from the ministry) in 1844; against his younger brother Bishop Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk (1791–1861) of New York, who in 1845 was suspended from the ministry on the charge of improper conduct; and against Bishop George Washington Doane of New Jersey for misappropriation. Meade also disciplined at least one priest in Portsmouth for practices he believed excessive and akin to Catholicism.

In 1851, some Virginians in counties north and west of Meade&#x27;s familial home wanted to secede from Virginia, politically as well as by selecting their own bishop. Bishop Meade pointed out that the section only had seven clergy, far less than the 30 required under church canons, and the proposal was defeated until after Meade&#x27;s death.

==Views on slavery==
Meade freed his own slaves, who moved to Pennsylvania, since Virginia&#x27;s laws at the time forbade emancipated slaves from remaining in the Commonwealth without special permission from the legislature. His views were influenced by his sister Ann Randolph Meade Page (died 1838) as well as his clerical mentors (who both freed slaves). On December 21, 1816, Rev. Meade traveled to Washington, D.C., for the organizational meeting of the American Colonization Society (ACS), thus helping Rev. Robert Finley (a Presbyterian), Francis Scott Key and U.S. Supreme Court clerk Elias B. Caldwell (son of the &quot;fighting chaplain of the third New Jersey regiment&quot;) establish that organization. In 1819, Virginia&#x27;s diocesan convention strongly supported the ACS, and Meade (as ACS&#x27;s agent) traveled through the American south campaigning for the removal of African American slaves to Africa. In Georgia he purchased slaves illegally brought into the state and sold publicly at Milledgeville.

However, Meade did not consider slavery a sin, merely a hindrance to economic growth. He believed Christian principles could teach masters to treat their slaves well. Thus, in 1813 Meade compiled and published a compilation of Christian proslavery tracts by authors including Anglican minister Thomas Bacon and Baptist Edmund Botsford. After his consecration, one of Meade&#x27;s earliest pastoral letters (in 1834) concerned religious instruction for slaves.

Beginning in 1833, Bishop Meade, Judge William Leigh of Halifax and lawyer Francis Scott Key administered the will of their friend John Randolph of Roanoke, who died without children and who in his final testament directed his executors to free his more than four hundred slaves. The executors fought for a decade through Virginia courts to enforce the will and provide the freed slaves land to support themselves.

In 1841 Meade reported for a diocesan committee concerning the best means for instructing slaves, urging clergyman to devote at least part of each Sunday&#x27;s sermon at slaves, or hold Sunday afternoon or weeknight services for them, and that if they could not catechize both white and black children, reserve those limited resources for slave children. Meade repeated the educational theme through his addresses and parochial reports, and in 1856 was criticized by an anonymous correspondent for remarks concerning slavery &quot;in the presence of ten or twelve Negroes, who were candidates for confirmation.&quot;

Meade convinced himself of the reciprocal nature of the master-slave relationship, and by 1857 published Christian proslavery tracts in his own name, declaring in his historical masterwork &quot;If the evil passions are sometimes called into exercise, the milder virtues are much more frequently drawn forth.&quot; In 1858, his suffragan John Johns took charge of the committee and emphasized missionary work among slaves. Johns later summarized Meade&#x27;s position as disliking slavery and considering it politically disadvantageous to the country, but relying on his own experience concerning manumission&#x27;s failures. As Meade grew older, perhaps influenced by slave rebellions in Virginia, or his family&#x27;s business interests, his views concerning slavery became more conservative. Biographer Johns stated that bishop Meade wrote to an American Tract Society meeting in New York opposing &quot;an attempt ... made to introduce the leaven of New England fanaticism&quot; and that Meade was unable to attend such meeting, but failed to mention the year the Tract Society&#x27;s directors then defeated the abolitionist resolution.

Meade&#x27;s last will and testament contains no explicit bequests of slaves, although it does direct (among other bequests) his executor to spend $200 to purchase tracts from the Evangelical Knowledge Society, the American Tract Society and the American Sunday School Union to be distributed among descendants of his brothers R.K. Meade and David Meade, as well as $500 to (ACS missionary) Rev. Charles Wesley Andrews &quot;to be expended in the manner directed in a paper or papers accompanying this will&quot;, as well as refers to two farms (Mountain View previously purchased by his son Philip Nelson Meade but who had not received a deed, and the adjacent Browers Farm and land in Missouri given to his three sons jointly with the expectation of sale and division between them).

==Confederate bishop==
Meade fought against Virginians who threatened secession after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, preaching at Millwood against the looming civil war on June 13, nearly two months after Virginia&#x27;s secession. Still, Meade believed in state&#x27;s rights and acquiesced in his beloved Commonwealth&#x27;s ultimate decision to secede. Although near retirement (John Johns having become his suffragan decades earlier), Meade became a leading figure in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. In 1859, shortly after John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry (not very far down the historic Shenandoah Valley road from Meade&#x27;s familial home and farm), the Episcopal Church held its General Convention in Richmond. There, the elderly Rt. Rev. Meade helped other southern bishops consecrate Henry Champlin Lay as a missionary bishop of the Southwest. Two years later, Bishop Meade as the senior seceding bishop, led the convention in Columbia, South Carolina in October 1861, which drew up the incorporation documents. However, he did not travel to Montgomery, Alabama for the preliminary organizational meeting July 3–6, 1861. Thus, Bishop Stephen Elliott of Georgia became the Presiding Bishop of the Confederate Episcopal Church.

On March 6, 1862, the elderly and infirm bishop returned to Richmond for the last time in order to assist his suffragan and Bishop Elliott in consecrating Wilmer&#x27;s son, Richard Hooker Wilmer, as bishop of Alabama at St. Paul&#x27;s Church. Bishop Meade had traveled by train from Gordonsville, along with his son, the Rev. Richard K. Meade, although coughing and obviously ill. He arrived at the church in time for the consecration, but afterward was confined to bed at a friend&#x27;s home, and died days later. According to tradition, the dying Virginia bishop gave his last blessing to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, whom he had long known from the days both had lived and worshiped in Alexandria, and who was married to the daughter of his sister Ann Page&#x27;s best friend. Bishop Meade was reputedly the only man who customarily called the general by his first name.

==Death and legacy==
Bishop Meade died in Richmond, Virginia, aged 72, on March 14, 1862. After a funeral at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Richmond, his body was placed in a vault in Hollywood Cemetery. The monument and remains were later moved to the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria.

Not long after Meade&#x27;s death, the counties adjacent to his home counties of Frederick and Clarke seceded from Virginia and became the state of West Virginia. The General Convention organized the Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia in 1877. Its first bishop, George William Peterkin, was a VTS graduate who had served with Meade&#x27;s son in the Confederate army, and whose vocation Bishop Meade had fostered. Furthermore, Peterkin&#x27;s long-serving successor at Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Church, Dr. William Meade Dame had been named in the bishop&#x27;s honor.

In 1868, Virginia&#x27;s diocesan council authorized a church near the Meade family&#x27;s estates in White Post, which was begun in 1872 under the direction of Rev. John Ravenscroft Jones (rector of Meade&#x27;s home Cunninham Chapel Parish as well as disciplined for his Confederate sympathies by occupying Union forces) and consecrated in 1875. Although inactive for a time, it now again has an active congregation, as well as graveyard which contains many Meade family graves and a Confederate memorial. Furthermore, in 1869, the rector of Christ Church in Alexandria, Randolph Harrison McKim (a Confederate veteran), organized a mission church for African American Episcopalians in the city where Meade had long served. In 1870, Bishop Johns consecrated that church in honor of his mentor, Meade Memorial Episcopal Church in Alexandria. Initially serviced by Rev. McKim and various VTS seminarians, it remains an active congregation.

<text>George Washington Doane (May 27, 1799 – April 27, 1859) was an American churchman, educator, and the second bishop in the Episcopal Church for the Diocese of New Jersey.

==Early life and career==

Doane was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated from Union College, Schenectady, New York, in 1818. He did additional studies in theology and, in 1821, was ordained deacon. In 1823 he was ordained as an Episcopal priest by Bishop Hobart, whom he assisted in Trinity Church, New York.

With George Upfold (1796–1872), Bishop of Indiana from 1849 to 1872, Doane founded St. Luke&#x27;s in New York City. From 1824 to 1828 he was professor of &quot;belles-lettres&quot; in Washington (now Trinity) College, Hartford, Connecticut. At this time, he was one of the editors of the &quot;Episcopal Watchman&quot;. He was assistant in 1828–1830 and rector in 1830–1832 of Trinity Church, Boston.

==Bishop of New Jersey==
Doane was called as second bishop of New Jersey, serving from October 1832 to his death in 1859 at Burlington, New Jersey. In 1837, he founded St. Mary&#x27;s Hall (now Doane Academy), to provide a classical education for girls. It was the first such boarding school for girls in the United States, in a period when numerous schools for girls were founded.

The school was supported in part by a gift from his wife, Eliza Greene Callahan (married firstly James Perkins; second George Washington Doane).
In 1846 he founded Burlington College, a school for boys. These fulfilled his theory of education under church control. Because of national financial crises, his business management of these schools got the diocese heavily into debt. In the autumn of 1852, a charge of lax administration was made against him before a court of bishops, who dismissed it.

Doane was shown to be an able and wise disciplinarian of these schools. His patriotic orations and sermons prove him a speaker of great power. He belonged to the High Church party and was a brilliant controversialist. He published &quot;Songs by the Way&quot; (1824), a volume of poems. He also wrote hymns, of which those beginning &quot;Softly now the light of day&quot; and &quot;Thou art the Way&quot; are well known.

He commissioned John Notman to build a chapel for St. Mary&#x27;s Hall. The congregation of St. Mary&#x27;s Church grew, and he commissioned architect Richard Upjohn to design a new St. Mary&#x27;s Church, his episcopal seat, completed in 1856. Both buildings have been recognized as National Historic Landmarks.

==Death==
Doane died in 1859. He was buried in Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington.

==Legacy==
Among those whom Doane had ordained during his lifetime was Joseph Wolff, a Jewish Christian missionary.

Doane&#x27;s biography and bibliography, &quot;Life and Writings of George Washington Doane&quot; (4 vols, New York, 1860–1861), was edited by his son, William Croswell Doane (1832–1913). He followed his father into the clergy and was called as the first Bishop of Albany. That both Doane and his son became &quot;bishops [was] a situation possibly not unique but certainly rare enough to be remarked upon.&quot;

Founded in 1837 and now known as Doane Academy, the private school he founded is coeducational, serving grades Pre-K through 12, and has a substantial endowment to ensure its future. It was the first academic, church run school for girls in the United States.

<doc id="1165510" wikidata="Q131224" url="?curid=1165510" title="Thymus (plant)">
<text>The genus Thymus ( ; thymes) contains about 350 species of aromatic perennial herbaceous plants and subshrubs in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World.

Several members of the genus are cultivated as culinary herbs or ornamentals, when they are also called thyme after its best-known species, &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot; or common thyme.

==Description==

The plants grow up to tall. The stems tend to be narrow or even wiry. The leaves are evergreen in most species, arranged in opposite pairs, oval, entire, and small, long, and usually aromatic. Thyme flowers are in dense terminal heads with an uneven calyx, with the upper lip three-lobed, and are yellow, white, or purple.

==Classification==
A considerable amount of confusion has existed in the naming of thymes. Many nurseries use common names rather than binomial names, which can lead to mix-ups. For example &quot;golden thyme&quot;, &quot;lemon thyme&quot;, and &quot;creeping thyme&quot; are all common names for more than one cultivar. Some confusion remains over the naming and taxonomy of some species, and Margaret Easter (who holds the NCCPG National Plant Collection of thymes in the UK) has compiled a list of synonyms for cultivated species and cultivars.

The most common classification is that used by Jalas, in eight sections: 
*Micantes: Iberian Peninsula, Madeira and the Azores, includes &quot;T. caespititius&quot;
*Mastichina: Iberian Peninsula, includes &quot;T. mastichina&quot;
*Piperella: Monotypic section confined to the vicinity of Valencia, Spain
*Teucrioides: Balkan Peninsula
*Pseudothymbra: Iberian Peninsula and north Africa, includes &quot;T. cephalotos&quot;, &quot;T. longiflorus&quot; and &quot;T. membranaceus&quot;
*Thymus: Western Mediterranean region, includes &quot;T. camphoratus&quot;, &quot;T. carnosus&quot;, &quot;T. hyemalis&quot;, &quot;T. vulgaris&quot; and &quot;T. zygis&quot;
*Hyphodromi: Throughout the Mediterranean region, includes &quot;T. cilicicus&quot; and &quot;T. comptus&quot;
*Serpyllum: The largest section, throughout whole region, apart from Madeira and Azores, includes &quot;T. comosus&quot;, &quot;T. doerfleri&quot;, &quot;T. herba-barona&quot;, &quot;T. longicaulis&quot;, &quot;T. pannonicus&quot;, &quot;T. praecox&quot;, &quot;T. pulegioides&quot;, &quot;T. quinquecostatus&quot;, &quot;T. richardii&quot;, &quot;T. serpyllum&quot;, &quot;T. sibthorpii&quot; and &quot;T. thracicus&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
The genus is native to temperate regions in Europe, North Africa and Asia. &quot;Thymus&quot; is particularly concentrated in Iran, attributed to the country&#x27;s diverse climate and location both in terms of geography and topography. &quot;Thymus quinquecostatus&quot; Celak is present in Korea. 

==Ecology==

&quot;Thymus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some butterfly and moth insect species, including &quot;Chionodes distinctella&quot; and the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. lixella&quot;, &quot;C. niveicostella&quot;, &quot;C. serpylletorum&quot;, and &quot;C. struella&quot; (the last three feeding exclusively on &quot;Thymus&quot;).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Thymus&quot; is cultivated for its fragrant leaves and used as a culinary herb in Mediterranean cooking.

Mrs Margaret Easter was appointed International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus in 2007.

==Uses==

Thyme is packed with phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals. Thyme species such as &quot;T. fedtschenkoi&quot;, &quot;T. pubescens&quot;, and &quot;T. transcaucasicus&quot; have large amounts of the essential oils thymol and carvacrol. These &quot;Thymus&quot; species are used for herbal tea, spice, and medicine. The therapeutic effect of thyme is largely attributed to these essential oils belonging to the terpenoids family. Thyme is considered amongst the most consequential medicinal plants due to its substantial amount of bioactive compounds. Thyme has been used to treat diabetes, cold and chest infections, and coughs. In conventional Korean medicine, &quot;T. quinquecostatus&quot; Celak has been used to treat cancer, hepatic disease, and constipation.

<doc id="1165520" wikidata="Q6704413" url="?curid=1165520" title="Lunn Poly">
<text>Lunn Poly was a large chain of travel agents in the United Kingdom. TUI Travel acquired Lunn Poly in 2003, and by the end of 2004 had retired the brand absorbing it within the wider Thomson Travel group.

==History==
The company originated from two successful travel agencies established in the 1890s, the Polytechnic Touring Association and Sir Henry Lunn Travel. The latter an early travel innovator for winter sports trips to Switzerland and Italy, as well as religious tours to Israel. Both firms were acquired in the 1950s by the British Eagle airline group, and combined into Lunn Poly in 1965.

It became a nationalised industry as part of the Transport Holding Company (THC) in 1969, a controlling stake costing £169,000. Trading losses during the ownership were estimated at £1.2m before the sale to Sunair in 1971 for £175,000. In October, Sunair and Lunn Poly operated the first Boeing 747 package holiday charter flight to Majorca using a leased BOAC aircraft. In 1972, the company became part of Thomson Travel Group.

Lunn Poly became an early trade innovator, by splitting its leisure and business travel. High street shops concentrated on package holidays, specialized offices were structured to serve the needs of business and industry. This business model was highly successful throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the 1980s, Lunn Poly had over 500 shops, and by the mid-1990s it was the largest travel agency in the UK. In 1995 it entered the holiday voucher market, valued at £400million to compete with Thomas Cook. The rivalry with Thomas Cook, and Going Places, led to a fierce price war in which Lunn Poly estimated it was sacrificing £10m per year to attract new customers away from its competitors. In 1998, Lunn Poly were the UKs largest wholly owned retailer of air-holidays with 2.3m air inclusive holidays sold, representing 20% of the market.

At the turn of the millennium, Lunn Poly unveiled alternative store formats including a megastore which had five key areas – long haul, short breaks, summer sun, families and late trips – the first of which opened in Leicester. A trial of family holiday only stores took place in Coventry but was not pursued further by Lunn Poly. At the time, a number of South Wales stores rebranded from Lunn Poly to Travel House due to the latter&#x27;s enhanced reputation in the region. By January 2003, Lunn Poly began to refine the megastore concept further, reducing the size of the new out of town stores to around 4,000 sq ft compared to the original Leicester stores floor span of 10,000 sq ft. The first new concept store opened in Swansea.

When TUI UK, which had acquired Thomson Travel, rebranded Britannia Airways as Thomsonfly in November 2003, the company insisted that there were no plans to rebrand Lunn Poly. The headquarters was moved from Lunn Poly House in Leamington Spa to London during the acquisition. In October 2004, TUI sold a number of Travel House Group stores to Martin Morgan Travel, before confirming the remainder would be rebranded to Lunn Poly. On 2 November 2004, the announcement was made that all Lunn Poly shops in the United Kingdom were to be rebranded as Thomson.

Despite the brand disappearing in 2004, Lunn Poly Limited was retained as a dormant company, registered at TUI&#x27;s UK headquarters in Luton until its dissolution from the UK companies house register in June 2024. In 2011, former employee Robert Bonnar was jailed for admitting to laundering £500,000 through a Lunn Poly store in Glasgow between 2002 and 2003.

==Marketing==
===Lunn Poly Television===
Lunn Poly Television began broadcasting on 1 June 2004, via Sky Digital. The 18 hour per day broadcast was produced by The Travel Channel, and was backed by a £1million advertising campaign across the Sky platform. As part of TUI retiring the Lunn Poly name, the TV channel was rebranded as Thomson TV before the end of 2004.

===Advertising===
Lunn Poly was famous for a long-running advertising campaign on television. These adverts featured people looking into what holidays the company offered. Another person would then say to them in disbelief &quot;Lunn Poly? Get away!&quot;, at which point the person would disappear into thin air and end up at a holiday spot.

In 2003, Lunn Poly relaunched its Getaway slogan as part of a new advertising campaign.

===Whispering Windows===
In late 2003, Lunn Poly introduced &quot;Whispering Windows&quot; created by Newlands Scientific. The technology would allow the windows to effectively talk to the customer, designed to encourage more interaction with the high street stores. The estimated increase in footfall during the first week of the windows was 42%.

<doc id="1165522" wikidata="Q341045" url="?curid=1165522" title="Mindfulness">
<text>Mindfulness is the cognitive skill, usually developed through meditation, of sustaining meta-attentive awareness towards the contents of one&#x27;s own mind in the present moment. Mindfulness derives from &quot;sati&quot;, a significant element of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and is based on Chan, &quot;Guān&quot;, and Tibetan meditation techniques. Though definitions and techniques of mindfulness are wide-ranging, Buddhist traditions describe what constitutes mindfulness, such as how perceptions of the past, present and future arise and cease as momentary sense-impressions and mental phenomena. Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Thích Nhất Hạnh, Joseph Goldstein, Herbert Benson, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and Richard J. Davidson.

Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice has been employed to reduce depression, stress, anxiety, and in the treatment of drug addiction. Programs based on mindfulness models have been adopted within schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans&#x27; centers, and other environments, and mindfulness programs have been applied for additional outcomes such as for healthy aging, weight management, athletic performance, helping children with special needs, and as an intervention during early pregnancy.

Clinical studies have documented both physical- and mental-health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy adults and children. Studies have shown a positive relationship between trait mindfulness (which can be cultivated through the practice of mindfulness-based interventions) and psychological health. The practice of mindfulness appears to provide therapeutic benefits to people with psychiatric disorders, including moderate benefits to those with psychosis. Studies also indicate that rumination and worry contribute to a variety of mental disorders, and that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance trait mindfulness and reduce both rumination and worry. Further, the practice of mindfulness may be a preventive strategy to halt the development of mental-health problems. Mindfulness practices have been said to enable individuals to respond more effectively to stressful situations by helping them strike the balance between over-identification and suppression of their emotional experiences by finding the middle point which is recognition and acceptance.

Evidence suggests that engaging in mindfulness meditation may influence physical health. For example, the psychological habit of repeatedly dwelling on stressful thoughts appears to intensify the physiological effects of the stressor (as a result of the continual activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) with the potential to lead to physical-health-related clinical manifestations. Studies indicate that mindfulness meditation, which brings about reductions in rumination, may alter these biological clinical pathways. Further, research indicates that mindfulness may favorably influence the immune system as well as inflammation, which can consequently impact physical health, especially considering that inflammation has been linked to the development of several chronic health conditions. Other studies support these findings.

Critics have questioned both the commercialization and the over-marketing of mindfulness for health benefits—as well as emphasizing the need for more randomized controlled studies, for more methodological details in reported studies and for the use of larger sample-sizes. While mindfulness-based interventions may be effective for youth, research has not determined methods in which mindfulness could be introduced and delivered in schools.

==Practice==
Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one&#x27;s attention to whatever is happening in the present moment.

===Watching the breath, body-scan and other techniques===
There are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which may be aided by guided meditations &quot;to get the hang of it&quot;. As forms of self-observation and interoception, these methods increase awareness of the body, so they are usually beneficial to people with low self-awareness or low awareness of their bodies or emotional state. However, it may provoke anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and dissociation, in people who are very focused on themselves, their bodies, and their emotions.
* One method is to sit in a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor, or a cushion, close one&#x27;s eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one&#x27;s nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out. In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one&#x27;s breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one&#x27;s natural breathing process/rhythm. When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, but non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing.
* In body-scan meditation the attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment. 
* One could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present. In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his MBSR program, is the mindful tasting of a raisin, in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully. By enabling reconnection with internal hunger and satiety cues, mindful eating has been suggested to be a means of maintaining healthy and conscious eating patterns. 
* Other approaches include practicing yoga asanas while attending to movements and body sensations, and walking meditation.

===Timings===
Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day. As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing. An old Zen saying suggests, &quot;You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day — unless you&#x27;re too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.&quot;

===In Buddhist context; moral precepts===
In a Buddhist context the keeping of moral precepts is an essential preparatory stage for mindfulness or meditation. Vipassana also includes contemplation and reflection on phenomena as dukkha, anatta and anicca, and reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings.

== Translations ==
Mindfulness meditation is part of Buddhist psychological traditions and the developing scholarship within empirical psychology.

===Sati and smṛti===
The Buddhist term translated into English as &quot;mindfulness&quot; originates in the Pali term &quot;sati&quot; and in its Sanskrit counterpart &quot;smṛti&quot;. It is often translated as &quot;bare attention&quot;, but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.

According to Bryan Levman, &quot;the word &quot;sati&quot; incorporates the meaning of &#x27;memory&#x27; and &#x27;remembrance&#x27; in much of its usage in both the &quot;suttas&quot; and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and ... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness&quot;.

According to Robert Sharf, &quot;smṛti&quot; originally meant &quot;to remember&quot;, &quot;to recollect&quot;, &quot;to bear in mind&quot;, as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term &quot;sati&quot; also means &quot;to remember&quot;. In the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta&quot; the term &quot;sati&quot; means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen. Sharf refers to the Milindapañha, which said that the arising of &quot;sati&quot; calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the four foundations of mindfulness, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the noble eightfold path, and the attainment of insight. According to Rupert Gethin, 
Sharf further notes that this has little to do with &quot;bare attention&quot;, the popular contemporary interpretation of &quot;sati&quot;, &quot;since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise.&quot;

Georges Dreyfus has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as &quot;bare attention&quot; or &quot;nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness&quot;, stressing that mindfulness in a Buddhist context also means &quot;remembering&quot;, which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information. Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of &quot;correct view&quot;, not just &quot;bare attention&quot;. Jay L. Garfield, quoting Shantideva and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, &quot;calling to mind&quot; and vigilantly &quot;retaining in mind&quot;. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of moralityat least in the context of Buddhism, from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.

===Translation===
The Pali-language scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843–1922) first translated &quot;sati&quot; in 1881 as English &quot;&quot; in &quot;sammā-sati&quot; &quot;Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind&quot;. Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered &quot;sammā-sati&quot; as &quot;correct meditation&quot;, Davids said: 
===Alternative translations===
John D. Dunne says that the translation of &quot;sati&quot; and &quot;smṛti&quot; as mindfulness is confusing. A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish &quot;retention&quot; as the preferred alternative. Bhikkhu Bodhi also describes the meaning of &quot;sati&quot; as &quot;memory&quot;. The terms &quot;sati&quot;/&quot;smṛti&quot; have been translated as:

* Attention (Jack Kornfield)
* Awareness
* Concentrated attention (Mahasi Sayadaw)
* Inspection (Herbert V. Günther)
* Mindful attention
* Mindfulness
* Recollecting mindfulness (Alexander Berzin)
* Recollection (Erik Pema Kunsang, Buddhadasa)
* Reflective awareness (Buddhadasa)
* Remindfulness (James H. Austin)
* Retention
* Self-recollection (Jack Kornfield)
==Definitions==

===Psychology===
A.M. Hayes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional over-engagement on the other hand. Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self-knowledge and wisdom.

====Trait, state and practice====
According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied. Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques. A distinction can also be made between the &quot;state&quot; of mindfulness and the &quot;trait&quot; of mindfulness.

According to David S. Black, whereas &quot;mindfulness&quot; originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and &quot;a capacity attainable only by certain people&quot;, scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness. Black mentions three possible domains:
# A trait, a dispositional characteristic (a relatively long lasting trait), a person&#x27;s tendency to more frequently enter into and more easily abide in mindful states;
# A state, an outcome (a state of awareness resulting from mindfulness training), being in a state of present-moment awareness;
# A practice (mindfulness meditation practice itself).

=====Trait-like constructs=====
According to Brown, mindfulness is:
Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs:
* Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)
* Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)
* Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS)
* Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS)
* Mindfulness Questionnaire (MQ)
* Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R)
* Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS)

=====State-like phenomenon=====
According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, &quot;A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is.&quot;

* The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures mindfulness as a state-like phenomenon, that is evoked and maintained by regular practice.
* The State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) is a 21-item survey with an overall state mindfulness scale, and 2 sub-scales (state mindfulness of mind, and state mindfulness of body).

====Mindfulness-practice====
Mindfulness as a practice is described as:
* &quot;Mindfulness is a way of paying attention that originated in Eastern meditation practices&quot;
* &quot;Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally&quot;
* &quot;Bringing one&#x27;s complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis&quot;

According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises. Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment. Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life. Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in acceptance and commitment therapy.

===Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation===
Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to Jon Kabat-Zinn&#x27;s definition as &quot;present moment awareness&quot;. However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness. Shinzen Young says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when &quot;concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together.&quot; John Yates (Culadasa) defines mindfulness to be &quot;the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness&quot;, where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.

=== Buddhism ===
According to American Buddhist monk Ven Bhante Vimalaramsi&#x27;s book &quot;A Guide to Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation&quot;, the term mindfulness is often interpreted differently than what was originally formulated by the Buddha. In the context of Buddhism, he offers the following definition:

In Buddhism, mindfulness is closely intertwined with the concept of interbeing, a philosophical concept used by Thich Nhat Hanh to highlight the interconnectedness of all things. This philosophy, rooted in Buddhist teachings such as Vipassana and Zen meditation, emphasizes awareness of the present moment and ethical living, reflecting the interconnected nature of existence.

===Other uses===
The English term &quot;mindfulness&quot; already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as &quot;myndfulness&quot; in 1530 (John Palsgrave translates French &quot;pensée&quot;), as &quot;mindfulnesse&quot; in 1561, and &quot;mindfulness&quot; in 1817. Morphologically earlier terms include &quot;mindful&quot; (first recorded in 1340), &quot;mindfully&quot; (1382), and the obsolete &quot;mindiness&quot; (c. 1200).

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to &quot;a state of being aware&quot;. Synonyms for this &quot;state of being aware&quot; are wakefulness, attention, alertness, prudence, conscientiousness, awareness, consciousness, and observation.

==Models and frameworks for mindfulness practices==

=== Two-component model ===
A two-component model of mindfulness based upon a consensus among clinical psychologists has been proposed as an operational and testable definition, : 
In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) &quot;involves bringing awareness to current experience—observing and attending to the changing fields of &quot;objects&quot; (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment – by regulating the focus of attention&quot;. Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention. Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the stream of consciousness.

=== The five-aggregate model ===
An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions. This model is based upon the traditional buddhist description of the Skandhas.

The five aggregates are described as follows:
# &quot;Material form:&quot; includes both the physical body and external matter where material elements are continuously moving to and from the material body.
# &quot;Feelings:&quot; can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
# &quot;Perceptions:&quot; represent being aware of attributes of an object (e.g. color, shape, etc.)
# &quot;Volition:&quot; represents bodily, verbal, or psychological behavior.
# &quot;Sensory consciousness:&quot; refers to input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations) or a thought that happens to arise in the mind.

This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals&#x27; previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation. The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment.

=== Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom ===
The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self-knowledge and wisdom. In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one&#x27;s subjective experience. This could include understanding what the &quot;present moment&quot; is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations. In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or &quot;seeing things as they are.&quot;

==Historical development==

===Buddhism===
Mindfulness as a modern, Western practice is founded on Zen and modern Vipassanā, and involves the training of sati, which means &quot;moment to moment awareness of present events&quot;, but also &quot;remembering to be aware of something&quot;.

====Early Buddhism====
&quot;Sati&quot; is one of the seven factors of enlightenment. &quot;Correct&quot; or &quot;right&quot; mindfulness (Pali: &quot;sammā-sati&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;samyak-smṛti&quot;) is the seventh element of the Noble Eightfold Path. Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a &#x27;power&#x27; (Pali: &quot;bala&quot;) which contributes to the attainment of &quot;Nibbana&quot;. This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with clear comprehension of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and delusion (Pali: &quot;moha&quot;) have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.

According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in Early Buddhism to liberation, &quot;constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.&quot; According to Vetter, &quot;Jhanas&quot; may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.

According to Thomas William Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is &quot;perhaps the most important&quot; after the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama Buddha as a rational technique for self-actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions.

====Zazen====
The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.

====Contemporary &quot;Vipassana&quot;-meditation====
In modern &quot;vipassana&quot;-meditation, as propagated by the Vipassana movement, &quot;sati&quot; aids &quot;vipassana&quot;, insight into the true nature of reality, namely the three marks of existence, the impermanence of and the suffering of every conditioned thing that exists, and non-self. With this insight, the practitioner becomes a so-called &quot;Sotāpanna&quot;, a &quot;stream-enterer&quot;, the first stage on the path to liberation.

Vipassana is practiced in tandem with Samatha, and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions. According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, Samatha is used as a preparation for Vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation.

Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices, which employs vipassanā and ānāpāna meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the Sutta.

=====Anapanasati, satipaṭṭhāna, and vipassana=====
Anapanasati is mindfulness of breathing. &quot;Sati&quot; means mindfulness; &quot;ānāpāna&quot; refers to inhalation and exhalation. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body. The &quot;Anapanasati Sutta&quot; gives an exposition on this practice.

Satipaṭṭhāna is the establishment of mindfulness in one&#x27;s day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one&#x27;s body, feelings, mind, and dhammas. The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: &quot;paññā&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;prajñā&quot;).

=====&quot;Samprajaña&quot;, &quot;apramāda&quot; and &quot;atappa&quot;=====
In contemporary Theravada practice, &quot;mindfulness&quot; also includes &quot;samprajaña&quot;, meaning &quot;clear comprehension&quot; and &quot;apramāda&quot; meaning &quot;vigilance&quot;. All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as &quot;mindfulness&quot;, but they all have specific shades of meaning.

In a publicly available correspondence between Bhikkhu Bodhi and B. Alan Wallace, Bodhi has described Ven. Nyanaponika Thera&#x27;s views on &quot;right mindfulness&quot; and sampajañña as follows:
====Monitoring mental processes====
According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.

According to Grzegorz Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:
* the six sense-bases which one needs to be aware of (&quot;kāyānupassanā&quot;); 
* contemplation on vedanās, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (&quot;vedanānupassanā&quot;);
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (&quot;dhammānupassanā&quot;).

===Stoicism===
The Greek philosophical school of Stoicism founded by Zeno of Citium included practices resembling those of mindfulness, such as visualization exercises. In his &quot;Discourses&quot;, Stoic philosopher Epictetus addresses in particular the concept of attention (&quot;prosoche&quot;), an idea also found in Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. By cultivating it over time, this skill would prevent the practitioner from becoming unattentive and moved by instinct rather than according to reason.

===Christianity===
Mindfulness traditions are also found in some Christian spiritual traditions. In his Rules for Eating, St. Ignatius of Loyola teaches, &quot;let him guard against all his soul being intent on what he is eating, and in eating let him not go hurriedly, through appetite, but be master of himself, as well in the manner of eating as in the quantity which he eats.&quot; He might have been inspired by Epictetus&#x27; &quot;Enchiridion&quot;.

===Transcendentalism===
Mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with other eminent Transcendentalists such as Emerson and Whitman:
The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of Western esotericism. Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church, which in India collaborated with Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833) and his Brahmo Samaj. He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians. This influence worked through on Vivekananda, whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west. Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention, which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society. It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the Theosophical Society. Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, who attempted to present a modern interpretation of Zen, adjusted to western tastes.

===Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR===
In 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill. This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people. MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the Eastern World, particularly from Buddhist traditions. Kabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by Philip Kapleau, a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as Thích Nhất Hạnh and Seungsahn. He also studied at the Insight Meditation Society and eventually taught there. One of MBSR&#x27;s techniques—the &quot;body scan&quot;—was derived from a meditation practice (&quot;sweeping&quot;) of the Burmese U Ba Khin tradition, as taught by S. N. Goenka in his Vipassana retreats, which he began in 1976. The body scan method has since been widely adapted to secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts.

Kabat-Zinn was also influenced by the book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; by William James which suggests that religions point toward the same experience, and which 1960s counterculture figures interpreted as meaning that the same universal, experiential truth could be reached in different ways, including via non-religious activities.

===Popularization, &quot;mindfulness movement&quot;===
Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology. In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by &quot;acceptance&quot;—attention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong. Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal rumination on the past or the future. &quot;Mindfulness&quot; may be seen as a mode of being, and can be practiced outside a formal setting. The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness &quot;popularization,&quot; and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising. It has also recently been a common trend to see among sport teams, with mindfulness practices being integrated as parts of teams routines. 

The latest changes when people moved from real-life meditation sessions to the applications on their smart devices has been even more accelerated by the global pandemic. Modern applications are adapting to the needs of their users by using AI technology, involving professional psychologists and offering many different mindfulness approaches to serve a wider audience, such as among athletes.

==Applications==
According to Jon Kabat-Zinn the practice of mindfulness may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary. Western researchers and clinicians who have introduced mindfulness practice into mental health treatment programs usually teach these skills independently of the religious and cultural traditions of their origins. Programs based on MBSR and similar models have been widely adopted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

===Therapy programs===

====Mindfulness-based stress reduction====
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a mindfulness-based program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga to help people become more mindful. While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular.

====Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy====
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological therapy designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with Major depressive disorder (MDD). It uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression. Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.

Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. 
Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.

==== Mindfulness-based pain management ====

Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness. Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of &#x27;loving-kindness&#x27;, and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework. It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks. It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.

====Acceptance and commitment therapy====
Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word &quot;act&quot;) is a form of clinical behavior analysis (CBA) used in psychotherapy. It is a psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. The approach was originally called &quot;comprehensive distancing&quot;. It was developed in the late 1980s by Steven C. Hayes, Kelly G. Wilson, and Kirk Strosahl.

====Dialectical behavior therapy====
Mindfulness is a &quot;core&quot; exercise used in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a psychosocial treatment Marsha M. Linehan developed for treating people with borderline personality disorder. DBT is dialectic, says Linehan, in the sense of &quot;the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis.&quot; As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says:
====Mode deactivation therapy====
Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) is a treatment methodology that is derived from the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and incorporates elements of Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment. Mode Deactivation Therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by Jack A. Apsche and Joan Swart.

====Other programs====

;Morita therapy
The Japanese psychiatrist Shoma Morita, who trained in Zen meditation, developed Morita therapy upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment.

;IFS
Internal Family Systems Model (IFS), developed by Richard C. Schwartz, emphasizes the importance of both therapist and client engaging in therapy from the Self, which is the IFS term for one&#x27;s &quot;spiritual center&quot;. The Self is curious about whatever arises in one&#x27;s present experience and open and accepting toward all manifestations.

;Mindfulness relaxation
Mindfulness relaxation uses breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.

===Schools===
In 2012 Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio published &quot;A Mindful Nation&quot;, and received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district.

Mindful Kids Miami is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools. This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other childcare providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children&#x27;s daily activities.

In 2000, The Inner Kids Program, a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.

MindUP, a classroom-based program spearheaded by Goldie Hawn&#x27;s Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington.

The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland. At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school&#x27;s faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.

Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district. Utilizing curriculum, &quot;Rise-Up&quot; is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while &quot;Mindful Community&quot; is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools. These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth.

=== Education ===
Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including Elementary and Secondary schools. This has been referred to as part of a &#x27;contemplative turn&#x27; in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium. The applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others. An additional benefit to Mindfulness in education is for the practice to reduce anxiety and stress in students. Based on a broad meta-analytical review, scholars said that the application of mindfulness practice enhances the goals of education in the 21st century, which include adapting to a rapidly changing world and being a caring and committed citizen. Within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students&#x27; attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills. As discussed by Ergas and Todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within Buddhism and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science.

Renshaw and Cook state, &quot;As scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially&quot;. Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena. &quot;A relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students&#x27; social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes&quot;. Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students&#x27; personal development and academic success. Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight into the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies.

Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, &quot;Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in &quot;at-risk&quot; children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration&quot;. Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, &quot;Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions&quot;. Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs. Yet, MBIs continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, &quot;Mindfulness practices, particularly in relation to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche – one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future&quot;. As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the &quot;benefits&quot; and &quot;results&quot; of MBIs are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.

Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller say, &quot;Anxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety&quot;. They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems. In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children. Their findings concluded, &quot;Participation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions&quot;. In the study by Flook, parents and teachers completed questionnaires which propose that participation in mindfulness programs is associated with improvements in child behavioral regulation. These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings. According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, &quot;School-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators&quot;. Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, &quot;Analysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield&quot;. Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice.

Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined. Research contends, &quot;Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people&quot;. Although much of the available studies find a high number of mindfulness acceptability among students and teachers, more research needs to be conducted on its effects on well-being and mental health for students. In a firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated &quot;the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program&quot;. According to their research, &quot;no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post-intervention or at three-month follow-up&quot;. Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.

===Business===
Mindfulness training appears to be getting popular in the business world, and many large corporations have been incorporating mindfulness practices into their culture. For example, companies such as Google, Apple, Procter &amp; Gamble, General Mills, Mayo Clinic, and the U.S. Army offer mindfulness coaching, meditation breaks and other resources to their employees to improve workplace functioning.

The introduction of mindfulness in corporate settings still remains in early stages and its potential long-term impact requires further assessment. Mindfulness has been found to result in better employee well-being, lower levels of frustration, lower absenteeism and burnout as well as an improved overall work environment.

===Law===
Legal and law enforcement organizations are also showing interest in mindfulness:
* Harvard Law School&#x27;s Program on Negotiation hosted a workshop on &quot;Mindfulness in the Law &amp; Alternative Dispute Resolution.&quot;
* Many law firms offer mindfulness classes.

===Prison-programs===
Mindfulness has been taught in prisons, reducing hostility and mood disturbance among inmates, and improving their self-esteem. Additional studies indicate that mindfulness interventions can result in significant reductions in anger, reductions in substance use, increased relaxation capacity, self-regulation and optimism.

===Government===
Many government organizations offer mindfulness training. Coping Strategies is an example of a program utilized by United States Armed Forces personnel. The British Parliament organized a mindfulness-session for its members in 2014, led by Ruby Wax.

==Scientific research==
===Effects and efficacy of mindfulness practice===
Mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970 and has been studied often as an intervention for stress reduction. Meta analyses indicate its beneficial effects for healthy adults, for adolescents and children, as well as for different health-related outcomes including weight management, psychiatric conditions, heart disease, sleep disorders, cancer care, adult autism treatment, multiple sclerosis, and other health-related conditions. An often-cited meta-analysis on meditation research published in JAMA in 2014, found insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight, but found that there is moderate evidence that meditation reduces anxiety, depression, and pain. However, this study included a highly heterogeneous group of meditation styles (i.e., it did not focus exclusively on mindfulness meditation), which is a significant limitation of this study. Additionally, while mindfulness is well known to have positive psychological effects among individuals diagnosed with various types of cancers, the evidence is unclear regarding its effectiveness in men with prostate cancer.

Thousands of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the methodological quality of some of the studies is poor. Recent reviews have described many of these issues. Nonetheless, mindfulness meditation is a popular subject for research, and many present potential benefits for a wide array of conditions and outcomes. For example, the practice of mindfulness has also been used to improve athletic performance, as a beneficial intervention for children with special needs and their caregivers, as a viable treatment option for people with insomnia an effective intervention for healthy aging, as a strategy for managing dermatological conditions and as a useful intervention during early pregnancy. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates physical pain through multiple, unique mechanisms. Meditation also may allow one to modulate pain. When exposed to pain from heating, the brain scans of the mindfulness meditation participants (by use of functional magnetic resonance imaging) showed their brains notice the pain equally, however it does not get converted to a perceived pain signal. As such they experienced up to 40–50% less pain.

Research has also investigated mindful movements and mindful exercises for different patient populations.

===Neurological studies===
Research studies have also focused on the effects of mindfulness on the brain using neuroimaging techniques, physiological measures and behavioral tests. Research on the neural perspective of how mindfulness meditation works suggests that it exerts its effects in components of attention regulation, body awareness and emotional regulation. When considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character, studies have shown that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity. Neuroimaging techniques suggest that mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditation are associated with &quot;changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network and default mode network structures.&quot; Further, mindfulness meditation may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Additionally, mindfulness-induced emotional and behavioral changes have been found to be related to functional and structural changes in the brain. It has also been suggested that the default mode network of the brain can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the therapeutic benefits of meditation. Recent research also suggest that the practice of mindfulness could influence genetic expression leading to a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases and favourable changes in biomarkers.

Grey matter concentrations in brain regions that regulate emotion, self-referential processing, learning and memory processes have shown changes in density following MBSR. Additionally, MBSR practice has been associated with improvement of the immune system which could explain the correlation between stress reduction and increased quality of life. Part of these changes are a result of the thickening of the prefrontal cortex (executive functioning) and hippocampus (learning and memorisation ability), the shrinking of the amygdala (emotion and stress response) and the strengthening of the connections between brain cells. Long-term meditators have larger amounts of gyrification (&quot;folding&quot; of the cortex, which may allow the brain to process information faster) than people who do not meditate. Further, a direct correlation was found between the amount of gyrification and the number of meditation years, possibly providing further proof of the brain&#x27;s neuroplasticity, or ability to adapt to environmental changes.

===Associations of mindfulness with other variables===
Mindfulness (as a trait, distinguished from mindfulness &quot;practice&quot;) has been linked to many outcomes. In an overview, Keng, Smoski, and Robins summarize: &quot;Trait mindfulness has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, agreeableness, conscientiousness, vitality, self esteem, empathy, sense of autonomy, competence, optimism, and pleasant affect. A 2020 study found links between dispositional mindfulness and prosocial behavior. Studies have also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression, neuroticism, absentmindedness, dissociation, rumination, cognitive reactivity, social anxiety, difficulties in emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, alexithymia, intensity of delusional experience in the context of psychosis, and general psychological symptoms.&quot; (References to underlying studies omitted from quotation.)

===Effects on mindfulness===
The mechanisms that make people less or more mindful have been researched less than the effects of mindfulness programmes, so little is known about which components of mindfulness practice are relevant for promoting mindfulness. For example, meta-analyses have shown that mindfulness practice does increase mindfulness when compared to active control groups. This may be because we do not know how to measure mindfulness. It could also be that mindfulness is dose-dependent and increases with more experience. To counter that, Bergomi et al. found that &quot;results provide evidence for the associations between self-reported mindfulness and meditation practice and suggest that mindfulness is particularly associated with continued practice in the present, rather than with accumulated practice over years.&quot;

Some research into other mechanisms has been done. One study conceptualized such mechanisms in terms of competition for attention. In a test of that framework, mindfulness was found to be associated (as predicted) with having an activated intention to be mindful, with feeling good, and with not being hurried or very busy. Regarding the relationship between feeling good and being mindful, a different study found that causality probably works both ways: feeling good increases mindfulness, and mindfulness increases feeling good.

One theory suggests an additional mechanism termed as &quot;reperceiving&quot;. Reperceiving is the beneficial effect that comes after the process of being mindful after all the intention, attention, and attitude has been experienced. Through reperceiving there is a shift in perspective. Reperceiving permits disassociation from thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and allows one to exist with them instead of being defined by them.

==Adverse effects==

Meditation (of which mindfulness is just a version) has also been correlated with unpleasant experiences. In some cases, it has also been linked to psychosis and suicide. Both the soundness of its scientific foundations and the desirability of its societal effects have been questioned.

In one study, published in 2019, of 1,232 regular meditators with at least two months of meditation experience, about a quarter reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences (such as anxiety, fear, distorted emotions or thoughts, altered sense of self or the world), which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice. Meditators with high levels of repetitive negative thinking and those who only engage in deconstructive meditation were more likely to report unpleasant side effects. Adverse effects were less frequently reported in women and religious meditators.

Another study from 2021 on the effects of mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) found negative side-effects in 37% of the sample while lasting bad effects in 6–14% of the sample. Most of the side effects were related to signs of dysregulated arousal (i.e., hyperarousal and dissociation). The majority of these adverse events occurred as a result of regular practice at home or during class, something that challenges the notion that it is only intense practice that can give rise to negative experiences; as it turns out intense all-day retreats or working with difficulty practice accounts for only 6% of adverse effects. The symptoms most readily recognized as negative were those of hyperarousal (e.g., anxiety and insomnia). On the other hand,

There is also mounting evidence that meditation can disturb various prosocial behaviors. By blunting emotions, in particular the social emotions of guilt and shame, it may produce deficits in the feelings of empathy and remorse thus creating calm but callous practitioners. In one study with 1400 participants researchers found that focused-breathing meditation can dampen the relationship between transgressions and the desire to engage in reparative prosocial behaviors. Another study found that meditation can increase the trait of selfishness. The study, consisting of two interrelated parts and totaling 691 participants, found that a mindfulness induction, compared to a control condition, led to decreased prosocial behavior. This effect was moderated by self-construals such that people with relatively independent self-construals became less prosocial while people with relatively interdependent self-construals became more so. In the western world where independent self-construals generally predominate meditation may thus have potentially detrimental effects. These new findings about meditations socially problematic effects imply that it can be contraindicated to use meditation as a tool to handle acute personal conflicts or relational difficulties; in the words of Andrew Hafenbrack, one of the authors of the study, “If we &#x27;artificially&#x27; reduce our guilt by meditating it away, we may end up with worse relationships, or even fewer relationships”.

Difficult experiences encountered in meditation are mentioned in traditional sources; and some may be considered to be an expected part of the process, e.g., seven stages of purification mentioned in Theravāda Buddhism. Possible &quot;unwholesome or frightening visions&quot; are mentioned in a practical manual on vipassanā meditation. Classical sources have various terms for &quot;meditation sickness&quot; and related difficulties, such as &quot;zouhuorumo&quot; (), &quot;chanbing&quot; () and &quot;mojing&quot; ().

==Concerns and criticism==

===Scholarly research===
Many of the above cited review studies also indicate the necessity for more high-quality research in this field such as conducting intervention studies using larger sample sizes, the use of more randomized controlled studies and the need for providing more methodological details in reported studies. The majority of studies also either measure mindfulness as a trait, and in research that use mindfulness interventions in clinical practice, the lack of true randomisation poses a problem for understanding the true effectiveness of mindfulness. Experimental methods using randomised samples, though, suggest that mindfulness as a state or temporary practice can influence felt emotions such as disgust and promote abstract decision-making. There are also a few review studies that have found little difference between mindfulness interventions and control groups, though they did also indicate that their intervention group was treated too briefly for the research to be conclusive. In some domains, such as sport, a lack of internal validity across studies prevents any strong claims being made about the effects of mindfulness. These studies also list the need for more robust research investigations. Several issues pertaining to the assessment of mindfulness have also been identified including the current use of self-report questionnaires. Potential for bias also exists to the extent that researchers in the field are also practitioners and possibly subject to pressures to publish positive or significant results.

Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent Western psychology publications.
These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions. Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.

===Shortcomings===
The popularization of mindfulness as a &quot;commodity&quot; has been criticized, being termed &quot;McMindfulness&quot; by some critics. According to John Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy: &quot;McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover.&quot; The psychologist Thomas Joiner says that modern mindfulness meditation has been &quot;corrupted&quot; for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and suggests that it encourages unhealthy narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets.

According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the &quot;unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,&quot; but reshaped into a &quot;banal, therapeutic, self-help technique&quot; that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions. While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster &quot;wise action, social harmony, and compassion.&quot; The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, &quot;[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of consumer capitalism.&quot; The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats.

Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics. Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented with concern to the teacher&#x27;s credentials and qualifications, rather than the student&#x27;s actual practice. Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a distinct separation from Buddhism - which is seen as a religion based in monastic temples - and expressed as “mindfulness” in a new psychology ethic, practiced in modern meditation centers.

<text>Avail is an American melodic hardcore band from Richmond, Virginia. Originally from Reston, Virginia, the band formed in 1987, its members including Joe Banks, Doug Crosby, Brien Stewart, and Mikey Warstler. The only original remaining member, guitar player Joe Banks, teamed up with rival band LDK&#x27;s (Learning Disabled Kids) Tim Barry. They moved to Richmond in 1990, and soon, after numerous line up changes, put together a solid lineup to release their first album &quot;Satiate&quot; in 1992. Many of their lyrics center on Richmond. The band released six studio albums.

The band has never officially disbanded, but has not released any new material since 2002 and stopped playing live shows in 2007.

On March 26, 2019, the band announced a reunion show at The National in Richmond, Virginia, scheduled for July 19. Since then, they have played multiple shows and continue to tour. There are currently no plans to release any new material.

<text>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), also known as atypical vaginal bleeding (AVB), is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding was used when no underlying cause was present. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is excluded. Iron deficiency anemia may occur and quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may include ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer. More than one category of causes may apply in an individual case. The first step in work-up is to rule out a tumor or pregnancy. Medical imaging or hysteroscopy may help with the diagnosis.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Options may include hormonal birth control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, and surgery such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. Over the course of a year, roughly 20% of reproductive-aged women self-report at least one symptom of AUB.

As adenomyosis is a common disorder with a prevalence of 20-35% it is often causative related. Recent research suggests that abnormal angiogenesis is associated to conditions of adenomyosis leading to abnormal uterine bleeding. This suggests options for therapeutic intervention with angiogenesis inhibitors.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include vaginal bleeding that occurs irregularly, at abnormal frequency, lasts excessively long, or is more than normal. Normal frequency of periods is 22 to 38 days. Variation in the length of time between cycles is typically less than 21 days. Bleeding typically last less than nine days and blood loss is less than 80 mL. Excessive blood loss may also be defined as that which negatively affects a person&#x27;s quality of life. Bleeding more than six months after menopause is also a concern.

==Causes==
The causes of AUB are divided into nine groups: uterine polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, cancer, blood clotting disorders, problems with ovulation, endometrial problems, healthcare induced, and not yet classified. More than one category of causes may apply in an individual case. Healthcare induced causes may include side effects of birth control.

==Mechanism==
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of AUB starts with a medical history and physical examination. Normal menstrual bleeding patterns vary from woman to woman, so the medical history covers specific details about the woman&#x27;s individual menstrual bleeding pattern, such as its predictability, length, volume, and whether she experiences cramps or other pain. The healthcare provider will also check to see whether she or any family members have any potentially related health conditions, and whether she is taking medication that might increase or decrease menstrual bleeding, such as herbal supplements, hormonal contraceptives, over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin, or blood thinners.

Medical tests include a blood test, to see whether the abnormal bleeding has caused anemia, and a pelvic ultrasound, to see whether the abnormal bleeding is caused by a structural problem, such as a uterine fibroid. Ultrasound is specifically recommended in those over the age of 35 or those in whom bleeding continues despite initial treatment. Laboratory assessment of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), pregnancy, and chlamydia is also recommended.

More extensive testing might include an MRI and endometrial sampling. Endometrial sampling is recommended in those over the age of 45 who do not improve with treatment and in those with intermenstrual bleeding that persists. The PALM-COEIN system may be used to classify the uterine bleeding.

== Management ==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Options may include hormonal birth control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, tranexamic acid, NSAIDs, and surgery such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. Polyps, adenomyosis, and cancer are generally treated by surgery. Iron supplementation may be needed.

==Terminology==
The terminology &quot;dysfunctional uterine bleeding&quot; is no longer recommended. Historically dysfunctional uterine bleeding meant there was no structural or systemic problems present. In AUB underlying causes may be present.

==Epidemiology==
About one-third of all medical appointments with gynecologists involve AUB, with the proportion rising to 70% in the years around menopause.

<text>Case Black (), also known as the Fifth Enemy Offensive () in Yugoslav historiography and often identified with its final phase, the Battle of the Sutjeska ( ) was a joint attack by the Axis taking place from 15 May to 16 June 1943, which aimed to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the Sutjeska river in south-eastern Bosnia. The failure of the offensive marked a turning point for Yugoslavia during World War II. It was also the last major German-Italian joint operation against the partisans.

The operation immediately followed Case White which had failed in accomplishing the same objectives: to eliminate the central Partisan formations and capture their commander, Josip Broz Tito.

== Background ==

During the previous operation Weiss, Chetniks fought against Partisans under Italian command. However, even during the operation, negotiations were held between the German and Italian leaders on the disarmament of the Chetniks. German Wehrmacht deeply believed that the Allies would invade the Balkans after victory in the North African campaign. In operations &quot;Weiss I&quot; and &quot;Weiss II&quot;, the Wehrmacht did not achieve their desired goals of destroying the Yugoslav partisans and establishing control over the region, so preparations began for a new venture.

With operation Schwarz, the Wehrmacht intended to clear the background of the Adriatic coast by destroying both the Chetnik and Partisan movements, which were still firmly established in Herzegovina and Montenegro. Hitler calculated that, in the event of a British invasion of the Balkans, Chetniks under Italian care would switch sides and join the Allies.

However, in the first phase, there were tensions and misunderstandings between the German and Italian armies on that issue. Since the Italian commanders in Yugoslavia were very reluctant to disarm the Chetniks, Hitler won the consent through Mussolini government and the Italian Supreme Command. General Mario Robotti was fiercely against the disarmament of the Chetniks, at least until the partisans were destroyed. This attitude was shared by Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, general Vittorio Ambrosio, but he had to obey the promise that Mussolini gave to Hitler. At the beginning of March 1943, general Ambrosio, summoned Robotti and Alessandro Pirzio Biroli to Rome for talks on the disarmament of Chetniks and operations against partisans.

=== Axis plans ===

The Axis rallied 127,000 land troops for the offensive, including German, Italian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and over 300 airplanes.

For this operation, the Commander of the Southeast, colonel-general Alexander Löhr, received elite 1st Mountain Division from the Eastern Front as reinforcements. Löhr entrusted the tactical command to the German troop commander in Croatia, Rudolf Lüters. The combat group for this operation was therefore called the Croatian Corps.

The German command adjusted the operational plan of action against Partisans to the characteristics of the terrain. They planned to concentrate main partisan divisions and their Supreme Headquarters on the naturally isolated and almost uninhabited area between the Tara and Piva canyons, and the Durmitor mountain, and to destroy it there with the mass use of aviation, artillery and mountain troops. The 1st Mountain Division with its northern wing, the Italian 19th Infantry (Mountain) Division &quot;Venezia&quot;, the battle group &quot;Ludwiger&quot; (724th German, 61st and 63rd Bulgarian Regiments), the 369th Infantry Division, the 118th Jäger Division with the 4th Home Guard Jäger Brigade of the Independent State of Croatia were deployed in a semicircle on the east and north sides. In the first phase, these forces were supposed to take control of Sandžak and push Partisan forces to the left side of River Tara. The southern wing of the 1st Alpine Division &quot;Taurinense&quot;, 23rd Infantry Division &quot;Ferrara&quot; and the 7th SS Mountain Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; were supposed to push Partisans from the south and southeast. After that, the 118th Jäger Division had the task of occupying the left bank of the Piva and thus closing the environment, so that the breakthrough was hindered not only by strong forces but also by deep river gorges. This would bring Partisan forces to a dead end and destroy them.

In addition to these forces, there were additional 4 Italian divisions deployed in Adriatic hinterland, from the Albanian border to the lower course of the Neretva: were these Italian divisions: 155th Infantry Division &quot;Emilia&quot; in the Bay of Kotor, 151st Infantry Division &quot;Perugia&quot; in area of Vilusi, Bileća and Trebinje, 154th Infantry Division &quot;Murge&quot; around Dubrovnik and 32nd Infantry Division &quot;Marche&quot; in
downstream of the Neretva, from Mostar to Metković.

=== Partisans activities prior to Axis offensive ===
While the Axis were preparing for Operation Schwarz, fierce battles were fought on the territory of Herzegovina and Montenegro. After operation Weiss, the operative group of Partisan divisions set out with all its might through Herzegovina to break into Montenegro, destroying the Chetniks and Italians units on its path, and taking control over the area. In that area, the exhausted fighters would rest, the wounded would be treated, and then they would move towards Kosovo and southern Serbia.

Fierce battles between partisans and Italian-Chetnik forces were fought in the sector Foča-Kalinovik-Gacko-Šavnik. Nevesinje passed from hand to hand as many as eight times. On April 6, Partisan forces forced the Drina, defeated parts of the Taurinense division and the Chetniks near Ifsar, captured Čajniče and besieged Foča, where an Italian battalion and about 1,000 Chetniks were surrounded. Chasing the Chetniks deeper and deeper into Montenegro, the Supreme Headquarters moved to Mount Durmitor.

After the heavy defeat inflicted on the Italians in Pivka Javorka, on May 1, the First and Second Proletarian Divisions embarked on a comprehensive offensive to liquidate the Italian-Chetnik garrison in Kolašin, with the intention of continuing the advance towards Berane. As part of the siege of Kolašin, a strike group of battalions (two battalions of the Fourth and one battalion of the Fifth Montenegrin Brigade) defeated the Italian regiment near Bioč on May 15.

At the beginning of operation Schwarz, the Yugoslav National Liberation Army had 22,148 soldiers in 16 brigades. There were 8,925 Partisans from Croatia (5,195 of those from Dalmatia), 8,293 from Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1,492 from Serbia (including Vojvodina and Kosovo) and 3,337 from Montenegro. By ethnicity 11,851 were Serbs, 5,220 Croats, 3,295 Montenegrins and 866 Muslims.

Partisan units were bringing with them central hospital with about 3,000 wounded. In addition, YNLA troops suffered from severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by typhoid.

==Operation==

=== Axis preparations ===
Wehrmacht forces were advancing towards Montenegro from the north and from the east. Partisan forces were keeping parts of the Italian Alpine Division &quot;Taurinense&quot; and about 1,100 Chetniks under blockade in Foča since April 15. In early May, parts of the German 369th Legionary Division penetrated as far as Foča, suppressing the Sixth East Bosnian and Fifteenth Majevica Brigades, liberating the Aosta battalion of the Italian Taurinense division and about 1,000 Chetniks, who had been under siege by Partisan forces for 23 days. The Chetniks were disarmed, and released.

The left wing of the 369th Legionary Division advanced from the direction of Priboj towards Pljevlja, and, without encountering any resistance, merged with the main body of the &quot;Taurinense&quot; division.

=== Disarmament of Chetniks ===
During the advance of the 7th SS Mountain Division and the 118th Jäger Division through eastern Herzegovina, German forces encountered a certain degree of Italian obstruction and skirmishes with the Chetniks. Hundreds of Chetniks were disarmed.

At the beginning of May, Pavle Đurišić established contacts with parts of the 1st Mountain Division and the 4th Brandenburg Regiment. The Germans decided to conceal their real intentions, so they let the first group of disarmed Chetniks go home. By accepting communication with the Chetniks, by mid-May 1943 they managed to concentrate a large number of Chetniks, led by Đurišić, around the town of Kolašin, where German combat units were already deployed. In a surprise raid on the morning of May 14, despite the established contacts and strong opposition of the commander of the Italian 14th Corps, general Ercole Roncaglia, the Germans captured the Chetniks in their sleep and disarmed them. German forces on the ground appealed to the higher command to reconsider the decision to arrest the Chetniks, because they proved to be reliable allies against the partisans, but the German command did not give up on the original idea. One part of captured Chetniks, including Đurišić, was to be interned in prison camps in Greece and Poland, and the rest for labor battalions in the upcoming fight against the Partisans. In the meantime, Mihailović left the village of Gornje Lipovo and headed for Serbia. After capturing the majority of Montenegrin Chetniks near Kolašin, the Germans continued with operation Schwarz.

=== Phase I: Initial battles (15–20 May) ===
After a period of troop concentration, the offensive started on 15 May 1943. The Axis troops used the advantage of better starting positions to encircle and isolate the partisans on the Durmitor mountain area, located between the Tara and Piva rivers in the mountainous areas of northern Montenegro and forced them to engage in a fierce month-long battle on waste territory.

The first clashes after operation Schwarz commenced, took place in the north, between Čajniče and Foča, with parts of the 369th Legionary Division, and in the east, near Brodarevo and Mojkovac, with the 1st Mountain Division. 

=== Phase II: Breakthrough attempt toward eastern Bosnia (21–27 May) ===
Faced with the advance of large German forces from the east, the Supreme Headquarters decided to prevent the closure of the ring by capturing Foča and provide communication with eastern Bosnia. The attack was carried out from May 21 to 25 by the reinforced 1st Proletarian Division against the majority of the German 118th Jäger Division and the 4th Home Guard Jäger Brigade of the Independent State of Croatia. Despite certain tactical successes (breaking up of the 7th Mountain Regiment on May 21 and the 13th Mountain Regiment on May 24), after a flanking attack by parts of the 369th Division near Gradac on May 25, this attack proved hopeless. From there, on May 27, the Supreme Headquarters ordered the transfer of all forces to the left bank of the Tara.

The 118th Jäger Division had the task of breaking out on Piva from the west and blocking it. On May 22, her 738th Regiment, without contact with Partisan units, broke out on Vučevo, a plateau west of Piva. However, they could not organize communications and supplies in this wide and impassable area, so the regiment commander, lieutenant colonel Anacker, sent one battalion to the south to establish a connection with the 7th SS Division, and one to the west, to connect with the headquarters of his division. The remaining, 2nd Battalion, in a battle on May 29, was repelled from dominant positions by the two battalions of the 2nd Proletarian Brigade. The intervention of parts of the division from the north, across the Drina, was suppressed by the forces of the 1st Proletarian Division, which moved across the Tara. Thus, the Partisan forces firmly occupied Vučevo and prevented the Germans from closing the ring on Piva. The next natural obstacle on which the 118th Division could do that was valley of river Sutjeska.

On May 18, the 7th SS Division and the Italian Division &quot;Ferrara&quot; began to appear from the south towards Šavnik, Žabljak and Mratinje. The successful defense of the First Dalmatian and the Fifth Montenegrin Brigades, which suppressed the appearance of the right wing of the 7th SS Division and the Italians, enabled the organization of an attack on the left wing of the 7th SS Division.

=== Phase III: Arrival of British mission (27 May – 3 June) ===

Informed on May 20, 1943 of the arrival of the British military mission, the Supreme Headquarters left Đurđevića Tara and settled in the forest near Black Lake, at the foot of Durmitor.

On the night of 27/28 May, the British Liaison Department arrived. At the head of this mission were Captain William F. Stewart, who worked at the British Consulate in Zagreb before the war spoke Serbo-Croatian, and William Deakin, a history professor at Oxford. In addition to the two of them, the mission had 4 more members.

The very next day, Tito received the British. He demanded military assistance and that the British Air Force bomb German concentration centers.

From May 31 until June 5, the 4th Montenegrin, 7th Krajina and 10th Herzegovinian brigades fought fierce and exhausting battles with the Germans on the rugged sides of the mountain Bioč and in the upper course of the Piva. The successes achieved were insufficient, given the reserves available to the Germans.

=== Phase IV: Supreme Headquarters in encirclement (4 June – 9 June) ===
As the attempt to break through the front via Foča failed, the Supreme Headquarters had to return to its initial positions, which the Germans used to make an even stronger ring. In addition to the daily fighting, the Sutjeska canyon was bombarded by planes every day, in a very low flight. On June 3, Tito crossed the Piva near Mratinje with the Supreme Headquarters. Thus, in the first days of June, the entire Supreme Headquarters found itself encircled, together with the central hospital in the Sutjeska valley.

On the same day, at the session of the Supreme Staff, the position of the Partisan groups with the hospital was discussed, and it was concluded that the situation was critical. The Supreme Headquarters saw that the main operational group could only break toward the west, through the Sutjeska valley because there were weaker German forces there. However, the Germans foresaw this development, so they hurried to fortify the entire Sutjeska valley. Having established that this direction, through the source part of Sutjeska and Gatačko Polje, was densely occupied in depth, the Supreme Headquarters decided to divide Partisan forces into two parts. The first group consisted of the 1st and 2nd Divisions, which had already forced Piva, with the Supreme Headquarters, and the second of the 3rd (in a slightly changed composition) and the 7th Division, with the Central Hospital and part of the councillors of AVNOJ, located east of Piva. The second group was led by Milovan Đilas, as a delegate of the Supreme Headquarters, and Sava Kovačević, who was appointed commander of the 3rd Division. The two groups were to break through in divergent directions in order to stretch the German forces. The first group was to break through Sutjeska to the northwest, while the second was given the task of returning to the right bank of the Tara, toward Sandžak.
The First Proletarian Division was sent to attack the valley of Sutjeska via Piva and Vučevo. As a dominant point, it was necessary take the hill at Vučevo, to make a corridor for the free passage over Sutjeska, in the direction of Zelengora and further to Bosnia. The German command also foresaw such a possibility, so it sent an advance force to take Vučevo. In a hand-to-hand battle, the forces of the 1st Proletarian Division managed to overcome the Germans and take control of this dominant point. The Germans then began to occupy the entire valley of the Sutjeska, from Tjentište to its confluence with the Drina near Čelebić. The 7th SS Division &quot;Prince Eugene&quot; penetrated in that direction, which surrounded the majority of forces and the central hospital. 

In the area around the canyons of Sutjeska and Suha, fierce battles began for the surrounding heights, which alternately fell into the hands of both. An area of 5–6 km was made for the passage of the majority of forces. The wounded were supposed to go there as well.

The First Proletarian Division marched through Milinklade and on June 8, 1943, broke out on Zelengora. The Second Proletarian Division was less fortunate. At the place of Bare, not far from Volujak, there was a scene of bloody battles with units of the 118th German Division.

On 9 June Tito was nearly killed on Milinklade when a bomb fell near the leading group, wounding him in the arm. The popular post-war report of the event credited Tito&#x27;s German shepherd dog Luks, for sacrificing his life to save Tito&#x27;s. Captain William F. Stewart (a Special Operations Executive operative who was parachuted into Tito&#x27;s headquarters alongside Captain William Deakin during May) was also killed by the explosion.

=== Phase V: Partisan breakthrough toward eastern Bosnia (10 June – 15 June) ===

Facing almost exclusively German troops, the Yugoslav National Liberation Army (YNLA) finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German 118th and 104th Jäger and 369th (Croatian) Infantry divisions in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2000 wounded were surrounded. Following Hitler&#x27;s instructions, German commander in chief Generaloberst Alexander Löhr ordered their annihilation, including the wounded and the unarmed medical personnel.

== War crimes ==
Of the more than 6,000 killed Partisan fighters in Sutjeska, a large number were exhausted fighters and wounded who were executed by the Germans. The report of the 1st Mountain Division says: &quot;Captured: 498, of which 411 were shot.&quot; Most of the immobile wounded (about 700 of them) were hidden by partisans, with nurses. However, the Germans, searching the terrain with search dogs, killed them almost to the last, together with the nurses. In addition, a large number of civilians were also killed. 

The SS Mountain division was also notorious for killing civilians suspected of helping partisans.

At the post-war trial, generals Alexander Löhr, Fritz Neidholdt and Josef Kübler and at that time Standartenführer August Schmidhuber were charged with war crimes during the battle. They were sentenced to death and executed in 1947.

== Aftermath ==
In total there were 7,543 partisan casualties, more than a third of the initial force. The German field commander, General Rudolf Lüters in his final report described the so-called &quot;communist rebels&quot; as &quot;well organized, skillfully led and with combat morale unbelievably high&quot;.

The successful Partisan breakout helped their reputation as a viable fighting force with the local populace. Consequently, they were able to replenish their losses with new recruits, regroup, and mount a series of counterattacks in eastern Bosnia, clearing Axis garrisons of Vlasenica, Srebrenica, Olovo, Kladanj and Zvornik in the following 20 days.

The battle marked a turning point toward Partisan control of Yugoslavia, and became an integral part of the Yugoslav post-war mythology, celebrating the self-sacrifice, extreme suffering and moral firmness of the partisans.

<text>Aggrey Zola Klaaste OMSG (6 January 1940 – 19 June 2004) was a South African newspaper journalist and editor. He was best known for being editor of the Soweto-based newspaper, the &quot;Sowetan&quot;, from 1988 to 2002. He introduced the concept of &quot;nation building&quot; while editor of the Sowetan and spent much of his time and energy promoting the idea.

==Early life==
Klaaste was born in Kimberley as one of eight children, in a township called Green Point in the Northern Cape. His father Tobias Klaaste was born in 1886 and died in 1973. His mother Regina Mantoa was born in 1900 and died in 1986. When he was three, his family moved to Sophiatown in Johannesburg, where his father became a clerk at a gold mine. Klaaste attended school in Newclare (previously known as Western Native Township), before moving onto Western High School, a predimoninatly coloured area at the time.

In 1955, when Sophiatown was dismantled, the family moved to Meadowlands in Soweto. He began studying at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1958 and graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Klaaste was one of the last blacks to have completed a degree at the university before it was closed to blacks by apartheid laws. In 1960 the apartheid government passed a law called the Extension of University Education Act, which meant some of the best universities in South Africa were reserved for the white minority. Klaaste attended WITS with South African literary luminaries like Miriam Tlali, the first black woman in South Africa to publish a novel in English.

==Career==
After graduating he became a journalist, first with &quot;Drum&quot; magazine and subsequently with &quot;The World&quot; (which was banned by the South African government in 1977) and &quot;The Post&quot; (which became the &quot;Sowetan&quot; in 1981). While working as an intern for Drum magazine, who&#x27;s celebrated writers had by this time moved on to different things, Klaaste&#x27;s lifestyle emulated that of his predecessors. He soon battled with alcoholism. In 1961 he took on a permanent job as a writer for Bantu World. Due to heavy drinking, he struggled to hold on to permanent work for too long. He found himself back at Drum in 1964, where he covered the famous Rivonia Trial. In 1977 he was arrested along with &quot;The World&quot; editor at the time, Percy Qoboza, and spent nine months in jail. This was a crack down led by the Special Branch police in an effort to shut down two of the most popular black publications at the time, &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;Weekend World&quot;.

==Nation Building==
In the late 1980s South Africa was a bedrock for mass protest action met with violence from the apartheid police. By 1988 Aggrey Klaaste was the editor of The Sowetan (previously The World) which was the largest circulating black newspaper in the country at the time. The ANC accused The Sowetan of showing preferential treatment and being pro-PAC and Black Consciousness. With these two factors to consider, Klaaste decided to shift the newspaper&#x27;s editorial policy and began sparking a dialogue around nation building. He wrote at length in his column On the Line about a non-racial South Africa and practical measures with which black people can make sense of apartheid on a daily basis. Klaaste was also known to be an active member of his community in Meadowlands, Soweto. Klaaste faced more criticism for his attempts at unifying a divided country, particularly from the Black Consciousness Movement, who accused him of ‘selling-out’ by spreading ideas of a non-racial society.

Prior to his death, he was an executive with the black empowerment company, New Africa Investment Ltd. (NAIL) as well as the chairperson of the Johannesburg Tourism Company. He was voted 58th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

<text>The McRib is a barbecue-flavored pork sandwich periodically sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s. It was first introduced to the McDonald&#x27;s menu in 1981, following test marketing the year before.

After poor sales, it was removed from the menu in 1985. It was reintroduced in 1989, staying on the menu until 2005 in many countries. Since 2006, it has generally been made available for a short time each year in most markets where it is sold, typically during the fall season, although it is a permanent menu item at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Germany and Luxembourg.

==Product description==
The McRib consists of a restructured boneless pork patty shaped like a miniature rack of ribs, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles, served as a sandwich on a roll. Meat restructuring was developed by the US Army to deliver low-cost meat to troops in the field. The process was refined by a Natick Army Labs meat scientist, Dr. Roger Mandigo, leading to the McRib patty. It is primarily composed of ground pork shoulder.

Government doesn&#x27;t patent their intellectual property, so anyone can use it. They (the Natick Center) presented material at technical meetings...The military allowed us to use the processes they&#x27;d developed. &lt;br&gt;− Roger Mandigo, Natick Center contractor and meat scientist

In an attempt to give pork &quot;the same stature as beef in the institutional market,&quot; the National Pork Producers Council funded Mandigo to show how to apply the new technique. Using his roadmap, McDonald&#x27;s then developed &quot;a patty of pork made from small flakes of meat taken from the shoulders of a pig&quot;

The McRib Jr. was available briefly in 2000. This version replaced the roll with a standard hamburger bun, and was served with two pickles and a smaller pork patty.

==History==
===1981–2004===
The McRib made its debut in the United States in 1981, as a limited-time item. It was first added to menus around Kansas City. It was developed by McDonald&#x27;s first Executive Chef René Arend, a native of Luxembourg who invented Chicken McNuggets in 1979. &quot;The McNuggets were so well received that every franchise wanted them,&quot; said Arend in a 2009 interview. &quot;There wasn’t a system to supply enough chicken. We had to come up with something to give the other franchises as a new product. So the McRib came about because of the shortage of chickens.&quot; It was his inspiration to shape the McRib patty &quot;like a slab of ribs,&quot; despite the fact that a round patty would have been cheaper to manufacture and serve on standard hamburger buns.

After several years, it returned for a promotion. It is more popular in Germany and Luxembourg, where it remains a permanent item.

===2005–present===
On November 1, 2005, McDonald&#x27;s issued a press release announcing that the McRib would be permanently removed from the menu following a &quot;McRib Farewell Tour&quot;. McRib.com, a website registered to McDonald&#x27;s, featured a petition to &quot;Save the McRib&quot;, which was facetiously sponsored by the &quot;Boneless Pig Farmers Association of America&quot;. On October 16, 2006, the &quot;McRib Farewell Tour II&quot; site appeared.

The McRib reappeared in the United States in October 2007, beginning a third &quot;farewell tour&quot;. McDonald&#x27;s sold 30 million made with over 7 million pounds (3 million kg) of pork in 2007. Its fourth reintroduction was in the end of October 2008, across the United States, Hong Kong, and Japan, with a promotional website featuring music sponsored by a &quot;McRib DJ Plowman&quot; in tribute to its creator.

Additional limited time regional offerings, in various regions of the United States as well as in Canada, were made throughout 2008 and 2009.

On November 2, 2010, McDonald&#x27;s began six weeks of nationwide McRib availability at the &quot;Legends of the McRib&quot; event in New York City, honoring three superfans: Joey Erwin, aka Mr. McRib; Alan Klein, founder of the McRib Locator website; and Adam Winer. The promotion ended December 5, 2010. McDonald&#x27;s credited it with boosting their November 2010 sales by 4.8%. It was the first national offering of the McRib since 1994.

The McRib was offered in Canada from June 21 to August 1, 2011. On October 24, 2011, McDonald&#x27;s once again made the McRib available for three weeks in a promotion ending November 14.

In celebration of the London Olympics 2012, McDonald&#x27;s Australia and New Zealand reintroduced the McRib as the Atlanta Pork McRib. The McRib was one of six limited edition McDonald&#x27;s items named after previous host cities. It was released on May 23 and ran until June 5. Sales of the McRib in New Zealand exceeded expectations, exhausting supplies within days of the release of the burger with restaurants running out of their allocations of stock.

For 2012, McDonald&#x27;s announced that the McRib&#x27;s annual release would be delayed until the December 17, as opposed to its traditional autumn release (which would instead be used to debut the Cheddar Bacon Onion Angus Burger, or &quot;CBO&quot;). The move was an effort to boost sales during the December period in an attempt to match 2011&#x27;s abnormally high restaurant wide sales figures.

The McRib wasn&#x27;t released nationally and was sold only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2005 &quot;McRib Farewell Tour&quot; promotion) in 2013 due to the company introducing several new products (such as the Mighty Wings). The McRib was sold again starting on October 20, 2014, and ending on January 4, 2015, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (a la the 2006 &quot;McRib Farewell Tour II&quot; promotion).

The McRib made a return in the United Kingdom on December 31, 2014, until February 3, 2015. The McRib was sold again starting in October 2015 and ending in January 2016, but only in a few cities in a few states in the United States (55 percent of McDonald&#x27;s locations). It became available again in November 2016, but at a limited number of McDonald&#x27;s locations; and once more since October 2017, but in most areas. Local McDonald&#x27;s Twitter accounts announced in Southern California and Hawaii that the McRib would be returning to these locations on November 2 and 9, 2017 respectively. The McRib once again made a limited return in the United States and Australia at participating locations starting in October 2018. The McRibs rolled out once again for a limited time beginning October 7, 2019.

For 2020, McDonald&#x27;s announced that the McRib would be made available nationwide in the United States for the first time since 2012, beginning on December 2. It was dubbed as &quot;the most important sandwich of the year.&quot; It also returned for a limited run, along with the &quot;El Maco Burger&quot;, in Australia.

On September 30, 2021, McDonald&#x27;s announced on Twitter that the McRib was returning on November 1 for a limited time. The previous day on September 29, the company tweeted that there was important news coming. The McRib was available at some locations before November 1.

On October 23, 2022, McDonald&#x27;s announced that the McRib would return on October 31, 2022, for a &quot;McRib Farewell Tour&quot;, the fourth such after the 2005 and the 2007 ones. The McRib was available until November 20. Despite the farewell tour promotion, in September 2023, McDonald&#x27;s announced that the McRib would return in November 2023.

On January 30, 2024, McDonald&#x27;s McRib sandwiches returned to Canadian locations for the first time since February 2014.

On October 4, 2024, McDonald&#x27;s announced that the McRib would be available in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2015, with a limited supply. 

====HSUS lawsuit====

In November 2011, the Humane Society of the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the producer of McRib meat, Smithfield Foods, alleging cruel and unusual treatment of the animals used in the McRib patty production. The complaint cites the use of gestation crates and poor and unsanitary living conditions, as well as a lack of proper animal welfare.

McDonald&#x27;s responded by requiring its U.S. pork suppliers to eliminate the use of gestation crates.

==Limited availability==
Speculation on the limited availability of the McRib includes theories concerning the fluctuating price and unreliable supply chains of bulk pork, manipulation of availability windows to turn the product into a better loss leader for the company, and the generation of renewed enthusiasm and higher sales as a result of scarcity.

An informal study from 2011 entitled &quot;A Conspiracy of Hogs: The McRib as Arbitrage&quot; illustrates a correlation between the price of pork and the timing of McDonald&#x27;s offering the sandwich; all five of the US McRib offerings between 2005 and 2011 occurred during low points in the price of bulk pork.

According to McDonald&#x27;s, the sandwich&#x27;s limited availability is due to their desire to provide a varied menu throughout the year.

<doc id="1165539" wikidata="Q278174" url="?curid=1165539" title="Takeshi Kaikō">
<text>was a prominent Japanese post-World War II Japanese novelist, short-story writer, essayist, literary critic, and television documentary writer. He was distinguished by his knowledge, intellect, sense of humor and conversational skills, and although his style has been criticized as wordy and obtuse, he was one of the more popular Japanese writers in the late Shōwa period.

==Early life==
Kaikō was born in the Tennoji Ward of Osaka as the son of an elementary school teacher. In 1948, he enrolled in the Law Department of Osaka City University, but was often absent from class, as he had to take a variety of part-time jobs in order to pay for his tuition. While in school, rather than study law he was sidetracked by the works of Motojirō Kajii, Mitsuharu Kaneko and Atsushi Nakajima. He also translated the works of Sherwood Anderson and Louis Aragon into Japanese. He graduated in 1953 and moved to Tokyo, where he took a job with Kotobukiya (the present Suntory), where he worked in the public-relations department.

He married Yōko Maki, a poet.

==Literary career==
Kaikō published his first work, &quot;Na no nai machi&quot; (Nameless City, 1953) in the literary magazine &quot;Kindai Bungaku&quot; soon after his move to Tokyo. It was largely ignored by critics. However, his second work, a short story titled &quot;Panniku&quot; (Panic, 1957) published in the &quot;Shin Nippon Bunkaku&quot;, caused a sensation for its unusual concept and style. It was a story about a dedicated forester in a rural prefecture of Japan, who struggles against government incompetence and corruption. Kaikō wrote the story as a satirical allegory comparing human beings to mice.

Kaikō won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 1957 with his &quot;Hadaka no ōsama&quot; (The Naked King), a story critical of the pressures placed on school children by Japan&#x27;s educational system.

Kaikō is considered a leftist activist, respected in many Indochinese countries, in particular, for his vocal opposition to Japan&#x27;s support of the United States&#x27; policies in Indochina in the 1960s. He was one of the founders of the &quot;Beheiren&quot; (&quot;Betonamu ni heiwa o! Shimin rengo&quot;), or the League for Peace in Vietnam. This activity was related to his experience as a war correspondent in Vietnam with the &quot;Asahi Shimbun;&quot; he was briefly imprisoned by the Viet Cong. These experiences translated into his novel, &quot;Kagayakeru yami&quot; (Into a Black Sun, 1968), an account of a Japanese journalist experiencing first-hand the life of the Americans and South Vietnamese troops in Vietnam. The novel won the prestigious Mainichi Book Award.

However, Kaikō had a wide range of topics in his repertory. &quot;Natsu no yami&quot; (Darkness in Summer, 1971) was essentially a romance between a reporter and an expatriate Japanese woman living in Europe.

Kaikō enriched the Japanese language with the word &quot;apache&quot;, to denote scavengers of recyclables, described in his novel, &quot;Japan&#x27;s Threepenny Opera&quot;.

Considered a gourmet, in his later years, Kaikō wrote numerous essays on food and drink, as well as appearing on food-related or fishing-related TV shows and in TV commercials.

He died of esophageal cancer. His grave is at the Shorei-in sub-temple of the Engaku-ji Temple complex, Kamakura, Kanagawa.

==Legacy==
His former house in Chigasaki, Kanagawa has been preserved as a memorial museum.

<text>Stopford Augustus Brooke (14 November 1832 – 18 March 1916) was an Irish churchman, royal chaplain and writer.

He was born in the rectory of Glendoen, near Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland, of which parish his maternal grandfather, Joseph Stopford, was then rector. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Sinclair Brooke, later incumbent of the Mariners&#x27; church, Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1857 and held various charges in London. From 1863 to 1865 he was chaplain to the Empress Frederick in Berlin. In 1869 with his brother Edward he made long tours of Donegal and Sligo, and spent much time at Kells studying Irish antiquities. Between 1866 and 1875 he was the minister at St James&#x27;s Chapel, a Proprietary Chapel, and after it closed he took services at Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury where he continued to attract large congregations. In 1875, he became chaplain in ordinary to Queen Victoria. But in 1880 he seceded from the Church, being no longer able to accept its leading dogmas, and officiated as an independent preacher for some years at Bedford chapel, Bloomsbury.

Bedford chapel was pulled down about 1894, and from that time he had no church of his own, but his eloquence and powerful religious personality continued to make themselves felt among a wide circle. A man of independent means, he was always keenly interested in literature and art, and a fine critic of both. The two-volume &quot;Life and Letters of Stopford Brooke&quot;, written by his son-in-law L. P. Jacks and published in 1917, contains many details of different facets of his life.

In 1890-1 he took the lead in raising the funds to purchase Dove Cottage, William Wordsworth&#x27;s home in Grasmere from 1800 to 1808, and establishing it “for the eternal possession of those who love English poetry all over the world&quot;. Dove Cottage is now administered by the Wordsworth Trust.

Brooke published in 1865 his &quot;Life and Letters of FW Robertson (of Brighton)&quot;, and in 1876 wrote an admirable primer of &quot;English Literature&quot; (new and revised ed., 1900—but see below), followed in 1892 by &quot;The History of Early English Literature&quot; (2 vols, 1892) down to the accession of Alfred the Great, and &quot;English Literature from the Beginnings to the Norman Conquest&quot; (1898).

He gave the inaugural lecture to the Irish Literary Society, London, on &quot;The Need and Use of Getting Irish Literature into the English Tongue&quot; (Bloomsbury House, 11 March 1893).

He delivered a sermon on &quot;The Kingdom of God Within&quot; to the International Council of Unitarian and Other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers, meeting in London in May 1901.

His other works include:
*various volumes of sermons
*&quot;Poems&quot; (1888)
*&quot;Dove Cottage&quot; (1890)
*&quot;Theology in the English Poets Cowper, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Burns&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Notes on the Liber Studiorum of J. M. W. Turner&quot; (1885; a later publication on the same subject &quot;suggested by the writings of Mr. Ruskin&quot;)
*&quot;Tennyson, his Art and Relation to Modern Life&quot; (1894)
*&quot;A Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue&quot; (co-edited with his son-in-law T.W.Rolleston) (1900)
*&quot;The Poetry of Robert Browning&quot; (1902)
*&quot;On Ten Plays of Shakespeare&quot; (1905)
*&quot;The Life Superlative&quot; (1906)

Brooke married Emma Wentworth-Beaumont (1830-1874) on 23 March 1858. They had six daughters, the eldest of whom was the social reformer Honor Brooke, and two sons, including Stopford Brooke, a Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1910. Brooke&#x27;s second daughter Maud married T. W. Rolleston, the Irish writer; his fourth daughter Olive married L. P. Jacks, philosopher, Unitarian minister and Principal of Manchester College, Oxford; and his fifth daughter Sybil married L. Leslie Brooke, the artist of children&#x27;s books: their son Henry was to become Home Secretary.

Brooke&#x27;s published letters record that his work brought him into touch with most of his famous contemporaries - including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Burne-Jones, William Morris, Viscount Bryce, James Martineau and Matthew Arnold. An art collector, he left the work &quot;The Cock Tavern at Cheam&quot; by Richard Wilson to the Tate Galleries.

<text>Emmen () is a municipality and town of the province of Drenthe in the northeastern Netherlands.

== History ==
A planned city, Emmen arose from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the province of Drenthe since the Middle Ages. Traces of these communities can still be seen in the form of the villages of Westenesch, Noordbarge and Zuidbarge: they have a separate history and layout but are surrounded by the suburbs and the center of Emmen.

The expansion of the town did not happen until after the Second World War. Suburbs were built around the old center of Emmen, starting with Emmermeer directly to the north, and followed to the south-east by Angelslo (for which an old village of the same name was demolished), Emmerhout (famed at the time for being separated from the town by an existing forest) to the east, Bargeres, the Rietlanden and Parc Sandur to the south and south-west. Construction of the last suburb, called Delftlanden, is well underway with many homes already built and people living in the area.

There are few historic landmarks left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where a church has been standing since the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the post office from the same time. In the town&#x27;s environs, an earthwork by Robert Smithson, &quot;Broken Circle/Spiral Hill&quot;, may be found.

In 1957 it hosted the 1st Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad.

The prime economic booster since the 1980s has been the zoo, the Dierenpark Emmen. Begun in the 1930s, it was almost completely redesigned in the 1970s and is now co-owned by the municipality of Emmen. It attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. It was replaced by Wildlands in 2016, when the old zoo closed. Important industries include Teijin Aramid, DSM Engineering Plastics, Wellman and Diolen Industrial Fibers (currently Senbis Polymer Innovations). There are extensive glasshouse complexes for horticulture, especially in the Klazienaveen-Erica area. The municipality offers some 38,000 jobs.

Emmen is the most populous urban area of Drenthe. The municipality of Emmen is one of the largest in the Netherlands, although the area outside the town borders of Emmen is rather rural. The other villages of importance are Emmer-Compascuum, Klazienaveen, Nieuw-Amsterdam,Zwartemeer, Nieuw-Amsterdam, Veenoord, Nieuw-Dordrecht, Nieuw-Schoonebeek, and Schoonebeek.

== Geography ==
The population centres:

* Barger-Compascuum
* Emmen
* Emmer-Compascuum
* Erica
* Klazienaveen
* Nieuw-Amsterdam
* Nieuw-Dordrecht
* Nieuw-Schoonebeek
* Nieuw-Weerdinge
* Roswinkel
* Schoonebeek
* Veenoord
* Weiteveen
* Zwartemeer
== Demography ==
The municipality of Emmen has some 107,000 inhabitants, with 56,000 living in the city of Emmen. Compared to some 3,000 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, this illustrates Emmen&#x27;s rapid growth in the past 150 years.

==Sports==
The town&#x27;s football club FC Emmen plays their home games in De Oude Meerdijk.

Every year a big cycle racing criterium called Gouden Pijl, where all the big names in bicycle sport come to Emmen for this event. Besides the bicycle race itself, the Gouden Pijl also includes cultural events like pop-concerts, etc. In 2008, the comeback concert of The Schizo&#x27;s, the infamous local punk-band from the 1980s, was organized during the Gouden Pijl.

Speedway Emmen hosts regular Stock Car and Banger Racing.

== Attractions ==
Attractions in Emmen are Wildlands Adventure Zoo Emmen, the inner city, the natural environment and the Rensenpark (with among others the Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art). There is also Museum Collectie Brands in the adjacent village of Nieuw-Dordrecht.

== Gallery ==
== Transportation ==
Emmen is served by one train connection with Zwolle, which in turn leads to the rest of the country.
*Emmen railway station
*Emmen Zuid railway station
*Nieuw Amsterdam railway station

In addition, there are regular and frequent bus lines within Emmen and towards Groningen, Hoogeveen and Assen, as well as the surrounding countryside, and Meppen in Germany, departing from Emmen&#x27;s two bus terminals.

By car, the town is accessible via the N34 from Ommen via Hardenberg and Coevorden towards Emmen, ending at the A28 motorway (Netherlands) towards Groningen near de Punt, the N381 to Drachten, the N391 to Veendam which goes through Emmen (with access to almost every district) and the A37 from Hoogeveen to Meppen in Germany, although this motorway is not directly next to Emmen. From the A37 to Emmen, there are three possibilities: at Junction Holsloot (A37 x N34), at Highway-exit Schoonebeek (A37 x N853), and Highway-exit Klazienaveen (A37 x N862). The A37 is also the quickest way towards the Randstad from Emmen. The A37 ends at the German border, where it continues as the B402 or European route E233.

The nearest airport is Groningen Airport Eelde at a distance of 50 kilometers.

Furthermore, there are inland shipping connections via Nieuw-Amsterdam to Coevorden, Hoogeveen and Almelo.

<text>Emmen is a village and municipality in the district of Hochdorf in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. The municipality Emmen consists of the village Emmen, the town Emmenbrücke, and several hamlets.

==History==
Emmen is first mentioned in 840 as &quot;Emau&quot; in a document of King Lothair I of Bavaria. For centuries the region was ruled by the Murbach Abbey in Vosges. In 1291 the municipality came under Habsburg rule. After the Battle of Sempach in 1386 the Habsburg&#x27;s lost Emmen and it became part of the Canton of Lucerne. Emmen also took part in the Swiss peasant war of 1653.

Since 1803, Emmen is part of the Hochdorf District and is its most populous municipality.

In 2008, the municipality of Emmen as well as Adligenswil, Ebikon, Horw and Kriens participated in the «Starke Stadtregion Luzern» project. In it, the merger of individual or several municipalities with the city of Lucerne was examined. In 2011, the merger was proposed by the project management as the most suitable means for the further development of the region around Lucerne. However, the voters of the municipality of Emmen rejected such a proposal in 2012 — as did voters in Adligenswil, Ebikon and Kriens. That meant that Emmen remained an independent municipality. As a result, Thomas Willi who was the president of the municipality at the time and strongly advocated for a merger resigned.

== Politics ==
As every Swiss municipality Emmen has a legislative and executive body, the &quot;Einwohnerrat&quot; and the &quot;Gemeinderat&quot;.

=== Einwohnerrat (legislative) ===
The Einwohnerrat has 40 members who are elected every four years.

=== Gemeinderat (executive) ===
The five-member Gemeinderat is the executive body. Each of them heads a directorate. In the legislative period 2024–2028, it consists of:

* Ramona Gut-Rogger FDP, &quot;Gemeindepräsidentin&quot;; Directorate of Security and Sport
* Patrick Schnellmann Die Mitte, Directorate of Finance and Human Resources
* Brahim Aakti SP, Directorate of School and Culture
* Andreas Roos Die Mitte, Directorate for Construction and Environment
* Beat Niederberger FDP, Directorate of Social Affairs and Society

== The naturalization law ==
The municipality of Emmen hit international headlines in 2001 when it announced new naturalization law. While there are some fixed requirements for obtaining Swiss citizenship by naturalization set at the federal level, such as the requirement to live and work for 12 years and speak the local language, Swiss cantons and communities are free to introduce more stringent requirements. Until 2001, naturalization was run by a popularly elected committee. But Emmen decided to have the citizens themselves run the nationalization process, requiring that potential citizens pass a series of tests and public interviews and subjecting citizenship applications to the public vote.

This process prevented many Yugoslavs-Swiss people, the largest ethnic group among citizenship candidates (Emmen has one of the largest of ex-Yugoslav community in Switzerland), from obtaining citizenship. Human rights campaigners said that the public interviews and voting were degrading. In July 2003, the practice was ruled discriminatory and unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Emmen has since returned to the previous system of naturalization committees.

<text>Harvey Johnson Jr. (born December 21, 1946), is an American politician from Mississippi. He was elected in 1997 as the first African American Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, serving two terms. He was known for his achievements in gaining reinvestment in the city to revitalize downtown.

He ran again in 2009 and was elected. When he ran for what would have been his fourth term, he was defeated in the Democratic primary in July 2013 by challengers Chokwe Lumumba, who was elected as mayor, and Jonathan Lee.

==Biography==
Harvey Johnson Jr. was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and attended the Vicksburg public schools, graduating from Rosa A. Temple High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Tennessee State University and a master&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Cincinnati.

His professional career includes the founding of the Mississippi Institute of Small Towns, a non-profit agency developed to assist small economically depressed towns with minority leadership with housing, community development and infrastructure needs. In 1990 Governor Ray Mabus appointed the subject to a six-year term on the state tax commission, which included the oversight of the newly established gaming industry.

In 1993, Johnson ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Jackson, placing third in the Democratic primary behind two white candidates, incumbent mayor J. Kane Ditto and former mayor Dale Danks. But in 1997, Johnson defeated Ditto in the Democratic primary, and later defeated Republican opponent Charlotte Reeves in the general election, becoming Jackson&#x27;s first African-American mayor.

Supporters credited Johnson with overseeing a dramatic renaissance in the city, leading the charge for several projects to help revive a decaying downtown area, including the revitalization of the Farish Street Neighborhood Historic District and passage of a controversial bond issue to build a convention center. Critics charged that he was an unresponsive leader who was not appropriately concerned with the city&#x27;s large crime problem, neglected the maintenance of streets, and did little to curb the exodus of Jackson&#x27;s upper- and middle-class residents to places outside the city limits.

During his reelection bid in 2001, Johnson faced off against Republican challenger, C. Daryl Neely, a city councilman. It was the first time in the city&#x27;s history that two African-American mayoral candidates faced each other in the general election. Johnson soundly defeated Neely with 61% of the vote.

In 2005, Johnson was challenged in the Democratic primary by Frank Melton, a controversial TV station manager; the challenger promised to solve the city&#x27;s crime problem in 90 days while giving few specific crime plans, making crime the central focus of the election. Critics charged that Johnson said crime was only a &quot;perception.&quot; But he had complained about the &quot;perception of hopelessness&quot; which he said the media&#x27;s focus on crime engendered. The phrase &quot;perception of crime,&quot; while inaccurate, was used widely by opponents and critics of the incumbent mayor. Melton defeated the incumbent by 63 percent of the vote in the Democratic Primary. Melton easily defeated Republican challenger Rick Whitlow in the general election and succeeded Johnson as mayor of Jackson.

Johnson is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is an alum of National Urban Fellows, class of 1976. Johnson is also a deacon at the Hope Springs Missionary Baptist Church of Jackson, Mississippi.

In early 2009, Johnson again ran for Mayor of Jackson. On Tuesday, May 5, 2009, he led a crowded field of ten candidates in the Democratic primary. Gaining 28% of the vote, Johnson was forced into a runoff with City Councilman Marshand Crisler, who had finished a close second with 27% of the vote. In the runoff two weeks later, Johnson defeated Crisler, winning in five of the seven wards, despite being outspent four to one. In a majority-black city that votes heavily Democratic, Johnson handily defeated Republican challenger George Lambus and four independent candidates in the June 2nd general election. Johnson&#x27;s election has made him become the city&#x27;s first three-term mayor since Dale Danks.

Running for re-election in the Democratic primary on May 7, 2013, the veteran mayor was defeated by Chokwe Lumumba, Ward Two Councilman, and Jonathan Lee, former Chamber of Commerce president, in every city ward. Lumumba was elected but died in office in 2014.

<text>In statistical mechanics, the &quot;n&quot;-vector model or O(&quot;n&quot;) model is a simple system of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice. It was developed by H. Eugene Stanley as a generalization of the Ising model, XY model and Heisenberg model. In the &quot;n&quot;-vector model, &quot;n&quot;-component unit-length classical spins formula_1 are placed on the vertices of a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional lattice. The Hamiltonian of the &quot;n&quot;-vector model is given by:

:formula_2

where the sum runs over all pairs of neighboring spins formula_3 and formula_4 denotes the standard Euclidean inner product. Special cases of the &quot;n&quot;-vector model are:

:formula_5: The self-avoiding walk
:formula_6: The Ising model
:formula_7: The XY model
:formula_8: The Heisenberg model
:formula_9: Toy model for the Higgs sector of the Standard Model

The general mathematical formalism used to describe and solve the &quot;n&quot;-vector model and certain generalizations are developed in the article on the Potts model.

==Reformulation as a loop model==

In a small coupling expansion, the weight of a configuration may be rewritten as 
:formula_10
Integrating over the vector formula_1 gives rise to expressions such as 
:formula_12
which is interpreted as a sum over the 3 possible ways of connecting the vertices formula_13 pairwise using 2 lines going through vertex formula_14. Integrating over all vectors, the corresponding lines combine into closed loops, and the partition function becomes a sum over loop configurations:
:formula_15 
where formula_16 is the set of loop configurations, with formula_17 the number of loops in the configuration formula_18, and formula_19 the total number of lattice edges.

In two dimensions, it is common to assume that loops do not cross: either by choosing the lattice to be trivalent, or by considering the model in a dilute phase where crossings are irrelevant, or by forbidding crossings by hand. The resulting model of non-intersecting loops can then be studied using powerful algebraic methods, and its spectrum is exactly known. Moreover, the model is closely related to the random cluster model, which can also be formulated in terms of non-crossing loops. Much less is known in models where loops are allowed to cross, and in higher than two dimensions.

==Continuum limit==

The continuum limit can be understood to be the sigma model. This can be easily obtained by writing the Hamiltonian in terms of the product 
:formula_20
where formula_21 is the &quot;bulk magnetization&quot; term. Dropping this term as an overall constant factor added to the energy, the limit is obtained by defining the Newton finite difference as 
:formula_22
on neighboring lattice locations formula_23 Then formula_24 in the limit formula_25, where formula_26 is the gradient in the formula_27 direction. Thus, in the limit,

:formula_28

which can be recognized as the kinetic energy of the field formula_29 in the sigma model. One still has two possibilities for the spin formula_29: it is either taken from a discrete set of spins (the Potts model) or it is taken as a point on the sphere formula_31; that is, formula_29 is a continuously-valued vector of unit length. In the later case, this is referred to as the formula_33 non-linear sigma model, as the rotation group formula_33 is group of isometries of formula_31, and obviously, formula_31 isn&#x27;t &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; isn&#x27;t a linear field.

==Conformal field theory==

At the critical temperature and in the continuum limit, the model gives rise to a conformal field theory called the critical O(n) model. This CFT can be analyzed using expansions in the dimension d or in n, or using the conformal bootstrap approach. Its conformal data are functions of d and n, on which many results are known.

<doc id="1165554" wikidata="Q2181195" url="?curid=1165554" title="Reflections (The Supremes song)">
<text>&quot;Reflections&quot; is a 1967 song recorded by American soul music group The Supremes for the Motown label. The single release was the first Supremes record credited to &quot;Diana Ross and the Supremes&quot;, and the song was one of the last Motown hits to be written and produced by Holland–Dozier–Holland before they left the label.

It peaked at the #2 position on the United States&#x27; &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart as well as the #5 slot on the UK Singles Chart in September 1967.

==Background==
This single, released at the height of the Summer of Love and long, hot summer of 1967 and the Vietnam War, was the first Supremes&#x27; release to delve into psychedelic pop; Holland–Dozier–Holland&#x27;s production of the song, influenced by the psychedelic rock sounds of bands such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, represented the beginning of a shift in Motown&#x27;s sound towards psychedelia. Although it is sometimes cited as one of the first mainstream pop recordings to feature a Moog synthesizer, the electronic sounds on the track were generated with a test oscillator treated with tape echo. Motown did, however, eventually purchase a Moog III synthesizer in December 1967.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Reflections&quot; peaked on the charts in the late summer and early autumn of 1967. Making the highest debut on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the week ending August 12, the song reached number 2 in the week ending September 9, 1967. One place short of being the group&#x27;s eleventh American number one, &quot;Reflections&quot; stalled at the penultimate position for two weeks behind Bobbie Gentry&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;, which Diana Ross would cover for the &quot;Reflections&quot; album. &quot;Reflections&quot; also peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;electronic effects are put to much use on this new outing from the Detroit mill, and the feedback play adds a cute appeal to the steady throbbing blues lament for an old love.&quot;

The first nationally televised performance to feature Florence Ballard&#x27;s replacement Cindy Birdsong as a member of the Supremes (now billed as &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;) was on an episode of the ABC variety show &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; first broadcast on September 26, 1967.

A 2003 remix of the song, running 3:16, features a cold closing as originally recorded instead of a fade-out.

&quot;Reflections&quot; was used as the theme song for the television series &quot;China Beach&quot; from 1988 to 1991. It was also sampled in &quot;Uh Huh Oh Yeh,&quot; the opening track on Paul Weller&#x27;s 1992 eponymous debut solo album.

<text>Commodore Josiah Tattnall (November 9, 1795 – June 14, 1871) was a United States Navy officer during the War of 1812, the Second Barbary War, the Mexican–American War and the Second Opium War. He later served in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Schooling and War of 1812==
Josiah was the son of Josiah Tattnall, who was Governor and U.S. Senator from Georgia. He was born on his father&#x27;s Bonaventure Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia. After studying in England, he was appointed a midshipman on January 1, 1812, and attended the Naval academy at Washington, D.C., until 1 August when he was assigned to the frigate &quot;Constellation&quot;.

When his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong British squadron operating in the Chesapeake Bay forced her to put into Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Constellation&quot; remained bottled up in Hampton Roads for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and marines assigned to the shore battery on Craney Island. On June 22, 1813, the British attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall&#x27;s battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city.

In April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from &quot;Constellation&quot; and, by August 24, was in command of a force of employees from the Washington Navy Yard. He led them into the Battle of Bladensburg in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On October 14, he was ordered to Savannah for duty on &quot;Epervier&quot;. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the Mediterranean with Commodore Stephen Decatur&#x27;s squadron to engage the Barbary Pirates in Algiers in the Second Barbary War. On June 17, she participated in the capture of the frigate &quot;Mashouda&quot; and, two days later, of the brig &quot;Estedio&quot;. In July, when &quot;Epervier&quot; was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in &quot;Constellation&quot;. In January 1817, he transferred to &quot;Ontario&quot; and returned in her to the United States.

==Interwar years, 1818–1845==
Promoted to lieutenant on April 1, 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate &quot;Macedonian&quot; on June 30, and he sailed in her for the Pacific in November. He was detached from &quot;Macedonian&quot; on August 30, 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on December 26, 1822, he joined Commodore David Porter&#x27;s squadron in schooner &quot;Jackall&quot;. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the West Indies on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on May 4, 1823. On June 23, 1824, Tattnall was ordered to &quot;Constitution&quot; for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to &quot;Brandywine&quot; and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828.

Tattnall served in &quot;Erie&quot; from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the Tortugas until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner &quot;Grampus&quot; on April 15, 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, &quot;Montezuma&quot;, which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas. He was detached from &quot;Grampus&quot; in September 1832 and went on leave awaiting orders for almost four years before being ordered in, July 1836, to recruit men for Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones&#x27; survey and exploration expedition.

Tattnall was promoted to commander on February 25, 1836, and, in April, reported for a three-year tour of duty at the Boston Navy Yard.

==Mexican–American War==
Following service with the Mediterranean and African squadrons, Commander Tattnall joined the Mosquito Division in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, commanding the steam gunboat, &quot;Spitfire&quot;. During the Mexican–American War, he took part in the attacks on Vera Cruz, San Juan d&#x27;Ulloa, and Tuxpan, and he suffered an arm wound. For his gallantry before Vera Cruz, the state of Georgia presented him with a sword.

==Interwar years, 1848–1860==
In 1848 and 1849, he returned to shore duty at the Boston Navy Yard. On February 5, 1850, he was commissioned captain and, the following month, was given command of &quot;Saranac&quot;. Next, he commanded the Pensacola Navy Yard from July 1851 to June 1854. From August 1854 to November 1855, Captain Tattnall was flag captain in &quot;Independence&quot; to Commodore William Mervine with the Pacific Squadron. At Hong Kong on January 29, 1858, he relieved Commodore James Armstrong taking command of the East India Squadron, breaking his flag in &quot;San Jacinto&quot;. During his two years in the Far East, Commodore Tattnall violated American neutrality while commanding the chartered steamer &quot;Toey-Wan&quot;, when he came to the assistance of a British and French squadron under fire from the Taku Forts at the mouth of the Pei Ho or Hai River. His explanation of his action, &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot;, subsequently became a famous slogan.

On his return voyage early in 1860, Tattnall commanded the &quot;Powhatan&quot;, carrying the first diplomatic embassy from Tokugawa Japan to the United States. While stopped at Honolulu, Hawaii along the way, the British residents of that city wrote a letter thanking Tattnall for his &quot;gallant and humane conduct&quot; during the &quot;unfortunate affair at the Pei-ho River&quot;. The embassy was safely conveyed to San Francisco and then Panama, where they crossed the isthmus and continued on to Washington, D.C.

==American Civil War==

At the outbreak of the Civil War, Capt. Tattnall held command of the Sackett&#x27;s Harbor Station. Though he opposed secession, Tattnall resigned his commission on February 21, 1861. A week later, Governor Joseph E. Brown commissioned Tattnall as the senior flag officer of the Navy of Georgia. On March 26, 1861, he received his commission as a captain in the Confederate Navy. Tattnall commanded Southern naval units during the defense of Port Royal until the harbor was captured by Union forces on 7 November 1861. From there, he moved to overall command of the defense of Virginia&#x27;s waters early in March 1862. Tattnall, by then a flag officer in the Confederate Navy as well as the Navy of Georgia, directed CSS &quot;Jamestown&quot; and other warships in captures of Federal merchantmen off Sewell&#x27;s Point in April 1862.

On May 11, 1862, in the face of advancing Federal forces, Flag Officer Tattnall ordered the destruction of his flagship, CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; (ex-&quot;Merrimack&quot;). He was later acquitted by a court martial of all charges stemming from that action. He resumed command of the naval forces of Georgia on May 29, 1862, and retained it until 31 March 1863, when he turned over command of forces afloat to Comdr. Richard L. Page and concentrated upon the shore defenses of Savannah. When Savannah fell to General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s troops, Tattnall became a prisoner of war.

He was paroled on May 9, 1865, and, soon thereafter, took up residence once more in Savannah.

==Death==
Tattnall died on June 14, 1871, in Savannah. He was living at the time on South Broad Street. He was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery. He is buried in the Tattnall family plot (section E, lot 1), beside his wife.

<text>The International Prison Chaplains&#x27; Association (IPCA) is an association of prison chaplains. It is divided into several sections like IPCA-Europe, IPCA Oceania etc. It is a non-governmental organization and has held Special Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2014.

==IPCA Europe==
IPCA-Europe, the European section of the global IPCA organization (founded 1985 in Bossey, Switzerland), commenced its work with the Ecumenical Conference for Pastoral Counselling in European Prisons, held in Strasbourg in May 1992. The conference was conducted in collaboration with the Council of Europe.

The working goal (now partially achieved) is to create a network between prison chaplains of all Christian churches in Europe. The network is intended to facilitate ecumenical cooperation and mutual support. The chief aims are: maintenance of human rights and freedom of religious practice and pastoral counseling in prisons, protection of minorities and improvement of the situation of crime victims.

At regular intervals, currently every four years, IPCA-Europe organizes a pan-European conference chiefly aimed at active prison chaplains. Following the 1992 event, further conferences took place in Rugby, England in 1994, in Ystad, Sweden in 1997 and in Driebergen, the Netherlands in 2001. Each conference was attended by more than 100 participants from some 30 European countries. Between the pan-European conferences IPCA-Europe also initiates working groups and regional conferences in collaboration with regional and national associations of prison chaplains.

IPCA-Europe is an associate organization of the CEC (Conference of European Churches) and is in contact with the Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe.

During the pan-European conferences a steering committee is elected to prepare the next conference and to conduct business. The steering committee is itself responsible for funding its work. It elects a chairman and, generally speaking, meets twice a year. The steering committee currently comprises eight elected members and one co-opted member from various European regions and churches.

IPCA-Europe does not have a secure budget at its disposal. The work is funded through project-based ecclesiastical and state grants. This funding is particularly crucial for ensuring the collaboration and participation of prison chaplains from Eastern and Southern Europe.

The Ten Points of IPCA-EUROPE
#&quot;IPCA Europe works on an ecumenical basis, founded on the IPCA Worldwide Charter&quot;. 
#&quot;We are keen to engage in activities which are firmly based on the good news of Jesus Christ&quot; 
#&quot;We are seeking to develop exchanges in Europe between our various chaplaincies with a view to providing mutual support&quot;. 
#&quot;We hope to establish European networks to encourage twinning and ecumenical working groups&quot;. 
#&quot;We hope that these exchanges could be extended to other countries, particularly the Third World, in conjunction with IPCA Worldwide&quot;. 
#&quot;We also hope to develop our watchfulness concerning the problems of justice and human rights, and with this in mind to work alongside the European Ecumenical Commission for Church and Society (Brussels and Strasbourg). (EECCS has developed to: KEK-Commission for Church and Society)
#&quot;We hope to be able to share more in the problems faced by church chaplains in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe&quot;. 
#&quot;We are working to help our churches to adopt the most appropriate position vis-à-vis justice and its social consequences in each of our countries&quot; 
#&quot;In the name of the different churches, united in the same desire to serve, we are called, as chaplains, to become communities of action and prayer in Jesus Christ&quot;.
#&quot;God willing, we will meet for a new Conference, organised by the Committee of IPCA-Europe, which will be held on the date and at the place to be decided on, if we so wish.

<text>The Jones Mountains () are an isolated group of mountains, trending generally east–west for , situated on the Eights Coast, Ellsworth Land, Antarctica, about south of Dustin Island.
==Location==
The Jones Mountains lie to the south of the Eights Coast, south of the Abbot Ice Shelf and southeast of Thurston Island.
Features of the southern part include, from west to east, Miller Crag, Sutley Peak, Walk Glacier, Forbidden Rocks and Christoffersen Heights.
Features of the northern part include, from west to east, Pillsbury Tower, Bonnabeau Dome, Cache Heights, Inspiration Rocks, Gopher Glacier, Anderson Dome and Mount Loweth.

<text>Commodore Oscar Charles Badger (August 12, 1823 – June 20, 1899) was an officer of the United States Navy who served in the Mexican–American and American Civil Wars.

==Service in Africa and during the Mexican–American War==
Badger received an appointment as a midshipman in the United States Navy on September 9, 1841, and, after a tour of duty in the , served in along the Atlantic coast of Africa. While serving in the latter ship, he saw his first action in the punitive expedition that landed on the west coast of Africa in 1843 and destroyed the Berribee villages. In the sidewheel steamer , during the Mexican–American War, he participated in the expedition that captured the Mexican town of Alvarado in the spring of 1847.

==Attended the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland==
Badger then attended the Naval School (as the Naval Academy was then called) at Annapolis, Maryland; completed his course of study there; and was warranted a passed midshipman on August 10, 1847.

==Posted to the Pacific Squadron==
By 1850, he was posted to the Pacific Squadron and served successively in the , the frigate , and the sloop . He returned to shore in 1853 for a tour of duty at the United States Naval Observatory located in Washington, D.C. In 1855, he returned to the Pacific Squadron for duty in the sloop and, that autumn, participated in an expedition to the Fiji Islands to redress wrongs suffered by members of the crews of American whalers and merchant ships at the hands of natives. The landing party destroyed the village of Vutia. To round out his pre-Civil War service, Badger was assigned in turn to the , , , and, lastly, to the Washington Navy Yard.

==Service in the American Civil War==
He was serving in the national capital at the outbreak of the Civil War, and took command of the screw steamer early in the conflict. In her, he participated in a series of actions against Confederate batteries along the Virginia bank of the Potomac River. During the Peninsula Campaign, he took part in the siege of Yorktown, Virginia. In 1862, he was transferred to the western theater to superintend the arming of river gunboats. In mid-1863, he was switched to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and participated in the attack on shore batteries on Morris Island on July 11, 1863. A week later, he commanded in an attack on Fort Wagner and, a month after that, led the ironclad in a series of operations against Forts Wagner, Gregg, and Sumter. On the night of August 22, 1863, he took command of the ironclad on another assault on Fort Sumter.

===Appointed fleet captain of the South Atlantic Blockade===
Soon thereafter, Badger was appointed fleet captain, ad interim, of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and, in that office, took part in another attack on Fort Sumter while in the flagship on the night of September 1, 1863. During that action, he was severely wounded in the leg by a flying metal splinter.

He spent the remaining years of the Civil War ashore performing ordnance duty at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and serving as inspector of cannon at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the war, he became a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Post-Civil War service with the fleet==
On December 26, 1866, he took command of the newly commissioned sidewheel steamer —a ship of the North Atlantic Squadron—and, in her, rendered assistance to the victims of a fire that destroyed Basseterre on St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands. The &quot;Peoria&quot; was decommissioned in September 1867. In 1868, he was assigned to equipment duty at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in New Hampshire. He returned to sea in 1871 in command of the of the South Atlantic Fleet. He commanded the receiving ship at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1873 and 1874 and served again at the Washington Navy Yard between 1875 and 1878.

==Final military service==
Badger&#x27;s last sea duty came in 1878 and 1879 when he commanded the frigate . He commanded &quot;Constitution&quot; on a voyage to France to represent the United States Navy at the Paris Exposition of 1878. The voyage, beset by several mishaps, lasted from March 1878 to May 1879. During 1880, he was stationed in Washington for special duty. While serving at the Naval Asylum in Philadelphia, Badger was promoted to commodore in November 1881.

After commanding the Boston Navy Yard between 1881 and 1885, Badger retired in August 1885. He died on June 20, 1899, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Family==
Badger married Margaret M. Johnston, daughter of Captain Z. F. Johnston, USN. Their son, Charles Johnston Badger, pursued a naval career and retired as a rear admiral.

==Memberships==
Commodore Badger was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

==Honored in ship naming==
The &quot;Badger&quot; (Destroyer No. 126) (1919–1945) was named for Commodore Oscar C. Badger, while his son, Admiral Charles Johnston Badger was similarly honored by the naming of the destroyer (1943–1957). The destroyer escort (subsequently rerated as a frigate) (1970–1991) honors the commodore, his son, his grandson, Admiral Oscar C. Badger II, and his cousin George Edmund Badger, the 12th United States Secretary of the Navy.

<text>Bloody Sunday of February 18, 1900, was a day of high Imperial casualties in the Second Boer War.

==Background==
It occurred on the first day of the Battle of Paardeberg. A combined British-Canadian force of 6,000 finally trapped a group of approximately 5,000 Boer soldiers and some civilians, under Piet Cronjé, in a bend of the Modder River near Kimberley, having advanced from south of the Modder River on the 11th. The Boers defended a series of trenches on Paardeberg Hill.

The Imperial commander, Kitchener (temporarily replacing the unwell Roberts), began the battle by ordering a charge straight at the Boer trenches. The land sloped down to the Boer position and lacked any cover for or more. The Highland Brigade and the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry, led the attack.

The Boer soldiers withheld fire until the British soldiers were within . The British were pinned and the exchange of fire continued until nightfall when the British withdrew. The Highlanders took almost 300 casualties; the Canadian losses were 18 dead and 60 wounded. Attacks elsewhere along the line resulted in a total 1,100 casualties, with two hundred killed – the worst single day loss for the Imperial forces.

After the first assault Roberts retook command that evening. With the Boers trapped he ordered the digging of trenches and a bombardment, which continued for nine days. On 27 February, after a confused night attack, the surviving Boer soldiers surrendered – around 4,000 in total.

A further 2,000 Imperial soldiers died or were invalided at Paardeberg from illness, mostly due to drinking the water of the Modder River, downstream from where the Boer were throwing horse and cattle corpses killed by the artillery fire.

<doc id="1165590" wikidata="Q351676" url="?curid=1165590" title="Viewing angle">
<text>In display technology parlance, viewing angle is the angle at which a display can be viewed with an acceptable visual performance. In a technical context, the angular range is called viewing cone defined by a multitude of viewing directions. The viewing angle can be an angular range over which the display view is acceptable, or it can be the angle of generally acceptable viewing, such as a twelve o&#x27;clock viewing angle for a display optimized or viewing from the top.

The image may seem garbled, poorly saturated, of poor contrast, blurry, or too faint outside the stated viewing angle range, the exact mode of &quot;failure&quot; depends on the display type in question. For example, some projection screens reflect more light perpendicular to the screen and less light to the sides, making the screen appear much darker (and sometimes colors distorted) if the viewer is not in front of the screen. Many manufacturers of projection screens thus define the viewing angle as the angle at which the luminance of the image is exactly half of the maximum. With LCD screens, some manufacturers have opted to measure the contrast ratio and report the viewing angle as the angle where the contrast ratio exceeds 5:1 or 10:1, giving minimally acceptable viewing conditions.

The viewing angle is measured from one direction to the opposite, giving a maximum of 180° for a flat, one-sided screen. A display may exhibit different behavior in horizontal and vertical axes, requiring users and manufacturers to specify maximum usable viewing angles in both directions. Usually, the screens are designed to facilitate greater viewing angles at the horizontal level, and smaller angles at the vertical level, should the two of them differ in magnitude.

The viewing angle for some displays is specified in only a general direction, such as 6 o&#x27;clock or 12 o&#x27;clock.

Early LCDs had strikingly narrow viewing cones, a situation that has been improved with current technology.

Narrow viewing cones of some types of displays have also been used to bring a measure of security in businesses, where employees handle private information in the presence of customers, banks being one example. Rectangular privacy filters fitting to the computer monitors have also been sold as accessories.

==LEDs==

LEDs are measured so that the line along half the viewing angle from directly forward is half the brightness as at directly forward.

<doc id="1165593" wikidata="Q7411720" url="?curid=1165593" title="Samuel Holland (surveyor)">
<text>Samuel Johannes Holland (1728 – 28 December 1801) was a Dutch-born Royal Engineer and first Surveyor General of British North America.

==Life in the Netherlands==
Holland was born in 1728 in Deventer, the Netherlands. He was baptised on 22 September 1729 in the small Lutheran Church in the Dutch town of Deventer, in the Province of Overijssel. In 1745, he entered the Dutch, or Staatse Leger artillery, and served during the War of the Austrian Succession. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1747.

In 1749, Holland married Gertrude Hasse. They had one daughter, who is thought to have died in infancy. In 1754, having possibly made contact with the Duke of Richmond and leaving his wife behind in the Netherlands, Holland emigrated to England to seek advancement under the British flag.

==Early years in British North America==
In 1756, Holland, probably with Richmond&#x27;s aid, became a lieutenant in the Royal Americans, coming to British North America where he would spend the rest of his life. Among his first assignments was the preparation of a map of New York Province that would be widely used for twenty years.

In 1757, during the French and Indian Wars, he was promoted Captain lieutenant and assigned to reconnoitre Fort Carillon, near Ticonderoga, New York, but in early 1758, he was transferred as assistant engineer to the expedition against Louisbourg. There, Holland made surveys of the surrounding area and prepared plans and gave engineering advice under the command of Brigadier-General James Wolfe. After Louisbourg&#x27;s capitulation, Holland was strongly commended by Wolfe to the Duke of Richmond.

That winter, Holland and his new pupil, James Cook, drew charts of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Saint Lawrence River in preparation for an attack on Quebec. He also supervised the construction of Fort Frederick in Saint John, New Brunswick. He was promoted captain in 1759, participated actively in the Siege of Quebec, and narrowly escaped death by his boats being nearly run down by a schooner.

Holland was later employed in surveying the settled parts of the Saint Lawrence River Valley and in drawing up new plans for a citadel in Quebec after the French siege was lifted.

==Surveyor General==
In 1762, Holland took his maps to London where he submitted them to the Board of Trade, proposing a survey of all British possessions in North America to facilitate settlement, a proposal that was accepted in 1764.

On 6 March 1764, Holland was appointed Surveyor-General of North America. On 23 March, he received instructions to survey all British possessions north of the Potomac River, which included St. John&#x27;s Island, the Magdalen Islands, and Cape Breton Island, because of their importance for the fisheries.

Holland arrived in October 1764 on Isle Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward Island)), whose territory was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Paris (1763). The task of mapping the island lasted two years. Holland&#x27;s survey divided the island into a series of townships known as &quot;lots&quot;, parishes, counties, and &quot;royalties&quot; (shire towns) in advance of a feudal land system which was established on the island over the following century. Holland was later given a parcel of land on the St. John&#x27;s Island, Lot 28, settled by farmers. Holland charged very little as an absentee landlord.

In 1767, he proposed that British explorers look for a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, but his proposal was never taken into great consideration.

In 1791 he became the Surveyor-General of Lower Canada and Upper Canada and was replaced with Sir David William Smith, 1st Baronet in 1792.

==Personal life==
Holland had begun living in Quebec as early as 1762 with then 21-year-old Marie-Joseph Rollet. Their first son, John Frederick, was born in what is now Prince Edward Island.

Although his separation from Gertrude Hasse had been amicable, he still paid her an annual allowance between 1756 and 1780. In 1784, Hasse unsuccessfully petitioned the British government to force him to renew payments.

In about 1772, Holland&#x27;s marriage to Marie-Joseph Rollet was contracted as legal. The couple would eventually establish a family of ten children.

Holland died at Quebec, Lower Canada, in 1801 and buried in a private cemetery on his Holland House estate or Holland Farm. This estate has since been re-developed.

==Honours==
Holland College, a community college system in Prince Edward Island, is named for Samuel Holland, whose descendants operate Samuel&#x27;s, a chain of coffee houses in the province.

The Captain Samuel Holland rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour.

The Holland River, in Ontario, which drains about 20,000 acres of the Holland Marsh into Lake Simcoe is named after him, as well as the community of Holland Landing, Ontario.

Samuel Holland Park and Holland Avenue in Quebec City are the only reminders of his Holland House estate.

<doc id="1165599" wikidata="Q3204577" url="?curid=1165599" title="Japan's Threepenny Opera">
<text>is a novel by Takeshi Kaiko in 1959.

The name was derived from Bertold Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; and in a way is its variant, in the Japanese setting.

The novel is based on actual events. It is set in post-World War II Japan. In the middle of Osaka there are ruins of the Imperial Arsenal demolished by American bombing, full of scrap metal. While the metals are precious in the destroyed economy of Japan, state bureaucracy is extremely slow to recover them. A settlement of outcasts, lumpen proletariat, spontaneously organize themselves into teams, using this circumstance as an opportunity to sneak into the Arsenal and scavenge the scrap. Reporters dubbed them &quot;Apaches&quot;, after the Native American Apache tribe, and they accepted the name.

The novel seemingly has no positive heroes, it is intentionally anti-aesthetical, but the reader feels sympathy for these people struggling for life in the miniature copy of the capitalist society with all its attributes: division of labour, exploitation, hard toil and the dream to get rich quick.

After this novel the term &quot;apache&quot; entered the Japanese language to denote scavengers of recyclables, e.g., of scrap paper.

<text>The Gulf Coastal Plain extends around the Gulf of Mexico in the Southern United States and eastern Mexico.

This coastal plain reaches from the Florida Panhandle, southwest Georgia, the southern two-thirds of Alabama, over most of Mississippi, western Tennessee and Kentucky, extreme southern Illinois, the Missouri Bootheel, eastern and southern Arkansas, all of Louisiana, the southeast corner of Oklahoma, and easternmost Texas in the United States. It continues along the Gulf in northeastern and eastern Mexico, through Tamaulipas and Veracruz to Tabasco and the Yucatán Peninsula on the Bay of Campeche.

==Geography==
The Gulf Coastal Plain&#x27;s southern boundary is the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico. On the north, it extends to the Ouachita Highlands of the Interior Low Plateaus and the southern Appalachian Mountains. Its northernmost extent is along the Mississippi embayment (Mississippi Alluvial Valley) as far north as the southern tip of Illinois. To the east the Gulf coastal plain meets the South Atlantic Coastal Plain in southern Georgia along the basin divide between the rivers flowing into the Gulf and those flowing to the Atlantic and south along the Apalachicola River through the Florida panhandle. The flat to rolling topography is broken by many streams, river riparian areas, and marsh wetlands.

=== United States section ===

The Gulf Coastal Plain is a westward extension of the Atlantic Coastal Plain around the Gulf of Mexico. It is only the lower, seaward part of this region that deserves the name of plain, for there alone is the surface unbroken by hills or valleys. The inner part, initially a plain, has been maturely dissected into an elaborate complex of hills and valleys, usually of increasing altitude and relief as one passes inland. The Gulf Plain features not found in the Atlantic coastal plain are:
* the peninsular extension of the plain in Florida
* the belted arrangement of relief and soils in Alabama and in Texas
* the Mississippi embayment or inland extension of the plain half-way up the course of the Mississippi River to its junction with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, with the Mississippi flood plain there included.

==== Florida peninsula ====
A broad, low crustal arch extends southward at the junction of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. The emerged half of the arch, constitutes the visible lowland peninsula of Florida. The submerged half extends westward under the shallow Florida overlapping waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The northern part of the peninsula is composed largely of a weak limestone.

Here, much of the lowland drainage is underground forming many sinkholes (swallowholes). Many small lakes in the lowland appear to owe their basins to the solution of the limestones. Valuable phosphate deposits occur in certain districts. The southern part of the state includes the Everglades, a large area of low, flat, marshy land, overgrown with tall reedy grass.

The eastern coast is fringed by long-stretching sand reefs, enclosing lagoons so narrow and continuous that they are popularly called rivers. At the southern end of the peninsula is a series of coral islands, known as the Florida Keys. They appear to be due to the forward growth of corals and other lime-secreting organisms towards the strong current of the Gulf Stream from which they obtain their food. The western coast has fewer, shorter off-shore reefs. Much of it is of minutely irregular outline.

==== Alabama – Mississippi belted plain ====
A typical example of a belted coastal plain is found in Alabama and the adjacent part of Mississippi. The plain is here about wide. The basal formation is chiefly a weak limestone, which has been stripped from its original Alabama innermost extension and worn down to a flat inner lowland of rich black soil, thus gaining the name of the black belt.

The lowland is enclosed by an upland or escarpment, known as Chunnenuggee Ridge, sustained by partly consolidated sandy strata. However, the upland is not continuous, but a maturely dissected escarpment. It has a relatively rapid descent toward the inner lowland, and a very gradual descent to the coast prairies, which become very low, flat and marshy before dipping under the Gulf waters, where they are generally fringed by off-shore reefs.

==== Mississippi embayment ====
The coastal plain extends inland on the axis of the Mississippi embayment. Its inner border affords admirable examples of topographical discordance where it sweeps northwestward square across the trend of the piedmont belt, the ridges and valleys, and the plateau of the Appalachians. All of which are terminated by dipping gently beneath the unconformable cover of the coastal plain strata. In the same way the western side of the embayment, trending south and southwest, passes along the lower southeastern side of the dissected Ozark plateau of southern Missouri and northern and central Arkansas. The southern Missouri and northern Arkansas Ozark plateau resembles in many ways the Appalachian plateau. The Ozarks and Ouachitas make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.

As the coastal plain turns westward toward Texas, it borders the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma and the Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma. The Ouachitas and the Arbuckles may be considered an analog of and possible extension of the Appalachian fold and crystalline belts.

==== Mississippi drainage basin ====
In the embayment of the coastal plain some low escarpment-like belts of hills with associated strips of lowlands suggest the features of a belted coastal plain. The hilly belt or dissected escarpment determined by the Grand Gulf formation in western Mississippi is the most distinct. Important salt deposits occur in the coastal plain strata near the coast. The most striking feature of the embayment is the broad valley which the Mississippi has eroded across it.

 The small proportion of total water volume supplied from the great Missouri River basin is due to the light precipitation in that region. The lower Mississippi has no large tributaries from the lower east, but two important ones come from the west. The Mississippi Arkansas drainage area being a little less than the Ohio River and the basin of the Red River of Louisiana being about half as large. The Mississippi River drains an area of about one-third of the United States. The head of the coastal plain embayment is near the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi. It flows southward for through the semi-consolidated strata of the plain. The river has eroded a valley about wide enclosed by bluffs one or two hundred feet high in the northern part. These bluffs decrease towards the south, but with local increase of height associated with a decrease in flood plain breadth on the eastern side where the Grand Gulf escarpment is traversed.

This valley in the coastal plain, with the much narrower rock-walled valley of the upper river in the prairie states, is the true valley of the Mississippi River. However, in popular usage, the Mississippi valley is taken to include a large central part of the Mississippi drainage basin.

The valley floor is covered with a floodplain of fine silt, having a southward slope of only half a foot to a mile (100 mm/km). The length of the river itself, from the Ohio mouth to the Gulf is about due to its windings. Its mean fall is about 3 inches per mile (50 mm/km). On account of the rapid deposition of sediment near the main channel at times of overflow, the flood plain, as is normally the case on mature valley floors, has a lateral slope of as much as 5, 10, or even in the first mile from the river, but this soon decreases to a less amount. Thus just a short distance from the river, the flood plain is often swampy, unless its surface is there aggraded by the tributary streams. For this reason Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi rank immediately after Florida in swamp area.

The great river receives an abundant load of silt from its tributaries, and takes up and lays down silt from its own bed and banks with every change of velocity. The swiftest current follows the outer side of every significant curve in the channel. Thus the concave bank on the side of the fastest part of the river is worn away. Any chance irregularity is exaggerated, and in time a series of large serpentines or meanders is developed, the most-symmetrical examples at present being those near Greenville, Mississippi. The growth of the meanders tends to give the river continually increasing length. This tendency is counteracted by the sudden occurrence of cut-offs from time to time, so that a fairly constant length is maintained.

The floods of the Mississippi usually occur in spring or summer. Owing to the great size of the drainage basin, it seldom happens that the three upper tributaries are simultaneously flooded. It is a serious problem for the lower river if two of the large tributaries flood at the same time. In this case, the lower river will rise to 30, 40 or even . The fall of the river is significantly steepened and its velocity is accelerated down stream from the point of highest rise. Conversely, the
fall and the velocity are both diminished up stream from the same point.

The load of silt carried down stream by the river finally, after many halts on the way, reaches the waters of the Gulf. There, the decrease of velocity aided by the salinity of the sea water, causes the formation of a remarkable delta, leaving less aggraded areas as shallow lakes (Lake Pontchartrain on the east, and Grand Lake on the west of the river). The ordinary triangular form of deltas, due to the smoothing of the delta front by sea action, is here wanting, because of the weakness of sea action in comparison with the strength of the current in each of the four distributaries or passes into which the river divides near its mouth.

==== Coastal plain in Louisiana and Texas ====
After constriction from the Mississippi embayment to in western Louisiana, the coastal plain continues southwestward with this breadth until it narrows to about in southern Texas near the crossing of the Colorado River (Texas Colorado River, not the Colorado River that flows through the Grand Canyon), but it again widens to at the national boundary as a joint effect of embayment up the valley of the Rio Grande and of the seaward advance of this river&#x27;s rounded delta front. These several changes take place in a distance of about . It includes a region of over , less than half of the large state of Texas. A belted arrangement of reliefs and soils, resulting from differential erosion on strata of unlike composition and resistance, characterizes almost the entire area of the coastal plain. Most of the plain is treeless prairie, but the sandier belts are forested. Two of them are known as cross timbers, because their trend is transverse to the general course of the main consequent rivers. An inland extension from the coastal plain in north-central Texas leads to a large escarpment known as Grand Prairie (not structurally included in the coastal plain), upheld at altitudes of 1,200 or by a resistant Cretaceous limestone. This dips gently seaward with its scalloped inland-facing escarpment overlooking a denuded central prairie region of irregular structure and form. Its gentle coastward slope of per mile (3 m/km) is dissected by many branching consequent streams. In its southernpart as it approaches the Colorado river, the escarpment is dissected into a belt of discontinuous hills. The western cross timbers follow a sandy belt along the inner base of the ragged escarpment of Grand Prairie. The eastern cross timbers follow another sandy belt in the lowland between the eastern slope of Grand Prairie and the pale western escarpment of the immediately eastward and lower Black Prairie escarpment. This escarpment is supported at an altitude of or less by a chalk formation, which gives an infacing slope some in height.

Its gently undulating or rolling seaward slope of 2 or 3 ft per mile (500 mm/km), covered with marly strata and rich black soil, determines an important cotton district. Then comes the East Texas timber belt, broad in the northeast, narrowing to a point before reaching the Rio Grande, a low and thoroughly dissected escarpment of sandy Eocene strata. This is followed by the Coast Prairie, a very young plain, with a seaward slope of less than 2 ft per mile (400 mm/km), its smooth surface interrupted only by the still more nearly level flood plains of the shallow, consequent river valleys. Near the Colorado river, the dissected escarpment of the Grand Prairie passes southward changing to a more nearly horizontal structure into the dissected Edwards plateau. The Edwards plateau is referred to later as part of the Great Plains. The plateau terminates in a maturely dissected fault scarp approximately 300 or in height as the northern boundary of the Rio Grande embayment. From the Colorado to the Rio Grande, the Black Prairie, the timber belt and the Coast Prairie merge in a vast plain, little
differentiated, overgrown with chaparral (shrub-like trees, often thorny), widening eastward in the Rio Grande delta and extending southward into Mexico.

Although the Coast Prairie is a sea bottom of very modern uplift, it appears already to have suffered a slight movement of depression. Its small rivers all enter embayments. However, the larger rivers seem to have counteracted the encroachment of the sea on the land by a sufficiently active delta building with a resulting forward growth of the land into the sea. The Mississippi has already been mentioned as rapidly building forward its digitate delta. The Rio Grande, next in size, has built its delta about forward from the general coastline. Since this river is much smaller than the Mississippi, its delta front is rounded by seashore effects. In front of the Brazos and the Colorado, the largest of the Texan rivers, the coast-line is very gently bowed forward as if by delta growth. The sea touches the mainland in a nearly straight shore line. Nearly all the rest of the coast is fringed by off-shore reefs or barrier islands, built up by waves from the very shallow sea bottom. Due to the weak tides, the barrier islands continue in long unbroken stretches between the few inlets.

==Habitats==
The northern region uplands are dominated by pine, originally longleaf and slash in the south and shortleaf mixed with hardwoods in the north. These are wildfire-maintained systems that give way to loblolly pine and hardwoods in damper areas and bottomland hardwood forest in extensive lowland drainages. The southern region has tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and western Gulf coastal grasslands. They include large habitats of freshwater wetlands, salt marshes, and coastal mangrove swamps. Much of the lower elevation Gulf Coastal Plain supports wintering waterfowl.

==Groundwater==
A global satellite study by German and USA scientists spanning the last decade indicates groundwater resources are shrinking due to overuse causing regional water security uncertainty in a changing climate. Surface water quality is declining due to increasing population, depleted streams, and land subsidence along certain coastlines. The Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain Aquifer is considered to have low to moderate stress, but the region&#x27;s economic capacity and land-use patterns signal trends toward a human-dominated stress on water resources.

<text>Levi Twiggs (May 21, 1793 – September 13, 1847) was an American military officer who served in the United States Marine Corps during the War of 1812, the Second Seminole War, and the Mexican–American War. He was killed by enemy fire while leading an attack during the Battle of Chapultepec.

==Early life==
Twiggs was born in Richmond County, Georgia, on May 23, 1793. His father was a leader in the Georgia militia during the American Revolutionary War.

==Career==
He joined the United States Marine Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant on November 10, 1813. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1815. During the War of 1812, he saw action on board &quot;President&quot; and was captured when that frigate was taken by a squadron of four British warships. After being imprisoned at Bermuda, he was freed when word of the Treaty of Ghent reached that island. He served at the New York and Philadelphia stations. In 1824, he was assigned to the USS &quot;Constellation&quot; under Commodore Lewis Warrington and served for two years in the West Indies Squadron. He was promoted to captain in 1830.
He fought in the Seminole Wars in Florida and Georgia in 1836 and 1837, and achieved the rank of major in November 1840. In 1843, Twiggs was assigned command of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. At the start of the Mexican-American War, Twiggs requested an active part in the fighting and was attached to the Marine Battalion which left New York in June 1847. He commanded the First Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Samuel E. Watson. He died due to enemy fire as he led a 40 marine &quot;storming party&quot; in the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847, and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
He married Priscilla Decatur McKnight, the granddaughter of Stephen Decatur, on November 12, 1822, in Brooklyn, New York. Together they had one son and three daughters that lived to adulthood. Their son, George Decatur Twiggs, was also killed while serving in the Mexican-American War.

==Legacy==
The USS &quot;Twiggs&quot; (DD-127) and USS &quot;Twiggs&quot; (DD-591) were named in his honor.

<text>Holland College is the provincial community college for the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island (PEI). It is named after the British Army engineer and surveyor Captain Samuel Holland. A significant percentage of college enrolment are international students on student visas. 

==History==

It was formed by the Government of Prince Edward Island, then led by Premier Alex Campbell, in 1969 as a result of an education reform policy undertaken as part of the &quot;Prince Edward Island Comprehensive Development Plan&quot;, which saw the closure of the province&#x27;s two post-secondary institutions structured along religious lines: St. Dunstan&#x27;s University and Prince of Wales College. It also led to the creation of the nondenominational University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) and Holland College. In 2015 the college began to focus increasingly on enroling international students on study visas. The enrolment of international students increased over the following years with the college unable to provide adequate housing by 2023. 

==Campuses==
===Charlottetown===
* Prince of Wales Campus (&quot;main campus&quot;)
* Belmont Centre
* Tourism and Culinary Centre (Home of the Culinary Institute of Canada)
===Alberton===
*West Prince Campus
===Summerside===
* Summerside Waterfront Campus
* Atlantic Police Academy, Slemon Park
* Marine Training Centre

==Programs==
Holland College offers more than 60 one-year certificate and two-year diploma programs.

==Scholarships==
The college offers almost $500,000 in scholarships and bursaries for eligible students. In 2010, the college joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret&#x27;d) Rick Hillier for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.

<doc id="1165622" wikidata="Q1141778" url="?curid=1165622" title="Serie D">
<text>The Serie D () is the highest level of semi-professional football in Italy. The fourth tier of the Italian league system, the competition sits beneath the third professional league, Serie C. It is administered by the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti and is organized by the Roman &quot;Comitato Interregionale&quot; (Interregional Committee), a &quot;league in the league&quot; inside the LND.

==History==
In 1948 the three leagues running Division 3 (Serie C) had to be reorganized due to an ever-growing number of regional teams. FIGC decided not to relegate the excess teams to regional championships. It chose the winners and a few runners-up from the 36 Serie C championships to be added to the new third division set up into 4 groups. The rest of the teams joined the new Promozione, which changed its name in 1952 into IV Serie (Fourth Division) and then in 1959 into Serie D.

From 1959 each player in the Serie D championships had to opt for semi-professional status, by signing a specially issued status attribution form. The championship was thus included in the &quot;Lega Nazionale Semiprofessionisti&quot;, today known as Lega Pro. Serie D was re-organized in 1981 when championships were reduced. The league name changed into the Interregional. Players lost semi-pro status and converted to amateurs. The championship subsequently passed into the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti. From 1992 to 1999 the name changed into Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti before eventually returning to the current Serie D name. With the merger of the Lega Pro&#x27;s two divisions at the end of the 2013–14 season (as decided by the FIGC and Lega Pro in November 2012) to reestablish Serie C, Serie D and the leagues below it moved up by one level in the pyramid system, reducing the number of leagues in Italian football to nine.

==Structure==
Since the early 1990s, Serie D has consisted of 162 teams split into 9 regional divisions (Gironi), usually formed of 18 teams each, divided geographically.

For the 2012–13 season, there were 166 teams. Two groups (B and C) were formed of 20 teams. In the 2013–14 season the number was 161 and one group (H) comprised 17 teams. For 2014–15 the distribution by region was as follows:

* Girone A – teams from Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria and Lombardy.
* Girone B – teams from Lombardy and Veneto.
* Girone C – teams from Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Veneto.
* Girone D – teams from Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Veneto.
* Girone E – teams from Lazio, Tuscany and Umbria.
* Girone F – teams from Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche and Molise.
* Girone G – teams from Lazio and Sardinia.
* Girone H – teams from Apulia, Basilicata and Campania.
* Girone I – teams from Calabria, Campania and Sicily.

==Promotions==
The first-placed team from each division is promoted to Serie C each year, replacing 9 teams from Lega Pro relegated to Serie D.

If a newly promoted Serie D team fails to meet the requirements, Lega Pro asks the second-placed team in that Serie D team&#x27;s division to fill the vacancy. Failing that, the third-placed team may fill the vacancy, and so on.

In recent years, one or more teams from the professional leagues have normally failed to meet the regulatory or financial requirements in order to participate. This usually creates vacancies that get announced in the summer rest period as the new season is being organized. As teams move up to fill the void created by these failed teams or teams in the lowest professional division fail, spaces are created in Serie C (or Lega Pro Seconda Divisione prior to the 2014–15 season) that need to be filled.

For example, in the 2007–08 season there were nine such failures, and thus, nine Lega Pro Seconda Divisione spaces were created. Four of those spaces were filled by &quot;calling back&quot; teams that had played in Seconda Divisione but were relegated to Serie D for the next season. The other five vacancies were filled by Serie D teams that had participated in the Serie D playoffs.

==Playoffs==
Playoffs are held at the conclusion of the regular season and involve teams placed second through fifth in each division. The first two rounds are single game elimination matches played at the home of the higher-classified team. Games ending in ties are extended to extra time. Since the 2007–08 season, if games are still tied after extra time, the higher classified team is declared the winner. No penalty shootout takes place.

In round one, for each division, the 5th-placed team is matched against the 2nd-placed team, and the 4th-placed team is matched against the 3rd-placed team. Round two matches together the two winners. At the end of round two, one team from each division survives and the nine winners are grouped into 3 groups of three and play each team in their own group once (one at home and one away). The three group winners qualify for the play-off semi-finals. Since 2007–08, the Coppa Italia Serie D winner qualifies for the 4th semi-final spot. The semi-finals are a two-legged tie, with the winners qualifying for a one-game final match played at a neutral site.

The playoff results provide the league with a list from which it may choose teams to fill vacancies in Serie C. The number of teams promoted through this method can vary each year; for example in 2007–08, the top 5 placed play-off teams were selected to fill vacancies, however, in 2006–07, no teams were needed to fill vacancies.

==Relegations Playout==

After the regular season is complete, bottom teams in each division play a double-leg series (6th-last vs 3rd-last, 5th-last vs 4th-last). The winners remain in Serie D for the following season. The two losers are relegated to Eccellenza, a regional amateur league below this, for a total of 4 relegations in each division, 36 in total for the league.

There are no play-out if the difference between 6th-last vs 3rd-last and that between 5th-last vs 4th-last is bigger than eight points.

==Tie-Breakers==
Serie D does not use head-to-head results to order teams that are tied in points in certain situations, single-game tie-breakers are held at neutral sites instead. Those situations are the following:

* a tie between 1st and 2nd place, where the winner would get a direct promotion to Seconda Divisione and loser qualifies for the play-offs.
* a tie between 5th and 6th place, where only the winner would qualify to participate in the play-offs.
* a tie between 7th-last and 6th-last, where the winner avoids participating in the relegation play-out.
* a tie between 3rd-last and 2nd-last, where the winner qualifies for the relegation play-out and the loser is directly relegated.

Head-to-head results are used in all other situations, such as when all the teams involved are qualified in the promotional playoffs, or all teams are participating in the relegation playoffs.

== &quot;Scudetto Serie D&quot; ==

Each year, at the end of the regular season, the winners of the nine Serie D divisions qualify for a championship tournament in order to assign the so-called &quot;Scudetto Dilettanti&quot; (amateur champions&#x27; title).

Round one divides the nine teams into three groups of three teams each where each team plays a single game against each of its other two opponents. The three group winners and best second-placed team advance to the semifinals.

The first &quot;scudetto dilettanti&quot; was assigned in 1952–1953, when the Serie D was still called &quot;IV Serie&quot; (fourth division). Its assignment was suspended from 1958–1959 to 1991–1992.

<text>Vigiles or more properly the &quot;Vigiles Urbani&quot; (&quot;watchmen of the City&quot;) or &quot;Cohortes Vigilum&quot; (&quot;cohorts of the watchmen&quot;) were the firefighters and police of ancient Rome.

==History==
The &quot;triumviri nocturni&quot; (meaning &quot;three men of the night&quot;) were the first men, being privately owned slaves, organized into a group that combatted the common problems of fire and conflagrations in Rome. Another organization dedicated to fighting fires in ancient Rome was a band of slaves led by the aedile Marcus Egnatius Rufus. The privately operated system became ineffective, so in the interest of keeping himself and Rome safe, Augustus instituted a new public firefighting force called the &quot;vigiles&quot;. Augustus modelled the new firefighters after the fire brigade of Alexandria, Egypt. The &quot;vigiles&quot; were also known by their nickname &quot;Spartoli&quot; or &quot;little bucket fellows&quot;, given to them because of the buckets they carried water in, which were made of rope sealed with pitch.

In AD 6, Augustus levied a 4% tax on the sale of slaves and used the proceeds to set up the new force. The first units of &quot;vigiles&quot; were under the command of the aediles and the &quot;vicomagistri&quot;. There were only 6,000 &quot;vigiles&quot; and they were all slaves. In 22 AD they were commanded by the &quot;praefectus vigilum&quot;, who was of equestrian rank, and &quot;subpraefectus&quot; and were divided into seven cohorts commanded by a tribune. Usually tribunes would begin their career by commanding a unit of the Vigiles. Each cohort was divided into seven centuries, each of 70–80 men commanded by a &quot;centurion&quot;. Each cohort patrolled two of the city&#x27;s fourteen administrative &quot;regiones&quot;. The &quot;vigiles&quot; were made up of freedmen by this time. The cohorts were doubled in size in AD 205.

The &quot;vigiles&quot; also acted as a night watch, keeping an eye out for burglars and hunting down runaway slaves, and were on occasion used to maintain order in the streets. Their most famous prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro, succeeded Lucius Aelius Sejanus as Prefect of the Praetorian Guard after his men had been used by the Emperor Tiberius to retake control of the city from Sejanus&#x27;s soldiers.

&quot;Vigiles&quot; were stationed at the harbour cities of Ostia and Portus. A &quot;vexillatio&quot; (detachment) of four centuries was detached from Rome for four months at a time, with two centuries being stationed at each city.

During the Great Fire of Rome, the vigiles took to looting the city rather than enforcing law and fighting the fires.

The &quot;vigiles&quot; appear to have lost their status as an independent unit and come under the authority of the Praetorian prefects sometime in the early 3rd century.

==Organization==
In the beginning, the corps had difficulty recruiting men. In an effort to entice men to enlist the &quot;Lex Visellia&quot; was passed in 24 AD, granting full citizenship and a bonus cash stipend to &quot;Vigiles&quot; after six years of service. By the 2nd century, citizens were also allowed to enlist.

The &quot;Vigiles&quot; were accommodated in barracks and patrolled the streets, especially at night, on the lookout for any unsupervised fires. Every householder was obliged to keep equipment for fighting fires, and the men themselves were equipped with pumps, buckets, hooks (for pulling down burning material), picks, mattocks and axes. They also used &quot;ballistae&quot; for knocking down burning houses and creating firebreaks. They even had their own medical support (&quot;medici&quot;), with four doctors attached to each cohort, and their own chaplains (&quot;victimarii&quot;). A &quot;siphonarius&quot; operated a pump and an &quot;aquarius&quot; supervised the supply of water. The ordinary firefighters were called &quot;milites&quot; (soldiers).

The Vigiles were organized into seven cohorts each 1,000 men strong. The cohorts contained seven centuries. The centuries were commanded by centurions, and the cohort was commanded by a tribune. The commander of the Vigiles was the &quot;Praefectus Vigilum.&quot; The centurions of the &quot;Vigiles&quot; would often go on to become centurions in the Urban Cohorts, followed by becoming a centurion in the Praetorian Guard. They would then transfer to the Legions, where they could reach the rank of Primus Pilus. The prefect was also known as the Prefect of the Watch. The prefect was an eques appointed by the emperor to command the seven cohorts. It was not a particularly sought after office until the 3rd century. Prominent jurists with a legal background began serving as Prefect to fulfil the magisterial capacity of the office. As a judge, the Prefect made rulings in his court for the common thieves caught during the night. Eventually, the Prefect was given jurisdiction over daytime petty crimes as well. According to Justinian, in the event of more serious crimes the decision was made by the praefectus urbi, &quot;if the offender is a person of such thuggish and infamous character ... the case is sent on to the prefect of the city&quot;. Often times &quot;Praefectus Vigilum&quot; would go on to be prefects of the Praetorian Guard.

Beyond the office of the prefect, the Vigiles were ordered by rank similar to the military. While some terms of service could extend beyond twenty years, most commissioned ranks were much shorter. Since the &quot;Vigiles&quot; never achieved the prestige of the Praetorian Guard or the Urban Cohorts, serving in the corps was usually only a means of achieving more honourable and lucrative posts.

One known &quot;praefectus&quot;, Placidianus was put in charge of an expeditionary force sent to Gaul by Claudius II (Gothicus) on his accession in 269 AD to secure the lower Rhone valley against the so-called Gallic Empire. This is the only known instance of the holder of this office being given a substantive command outside Rome. Whether or not his force included &quot;vigiles&quot; from the city is uncertain.

Whether or not the &quot;Praefectus Vigilum&quot; had his headquarters in any of the &quot;stationes&quot; identified above or whether he had an entirely separate &quot;praefectura&quot; is not known. If he is associated with one of the barracks it is likely to have been that of I Cohort in the &quot;Via Lata&quot;.
==Duties==
===Fighting fires===
Every cohort was equipped with standard firefighting equipment. The &quot;sipho&quot; or fire engine was pulled by horses and consisted of a large double action pump that was partially submerged in a reservoir of water. The Vigiles designated as &quot;aquarii&quot; needed to have an accurate knowledge of where water was located, and they also formed bucket brigades to bring water to the fire. Attempts were made to smother the fire by covering it with patchwork quilts (&quot;centones&quot;) soaked with water. There is even evidence that chemical firefighting methods were used by throwing a vinegar based substance called &quot;acetum&quot; into fires. In many cases the best way to prevent the spread of flames was to tear down the burning building with hooks and levers. For fires in multiple story buildings, cushions and mattresses were spread out on the ground for people to jump onto from the upper levels.

A major duty of the Vigiles was to enforce preventative measures against conflagrations. Adequate fire fighting equipment was required in every home. The Digest of Justinian decrees that Vigiles are &quot;ordered to remind every one to have a supply of water ready in his upper room&quot;. While the Vigiles only had advising authority, their recommendations were often followed to avoid repercussions for negligence. Corporal punishment was the most common punishment for negligence according to the Digest of Justinian, &quot;where persons have paid insufficient attention to their fire, the prefect ... orders them to be beaten&quot;.

During the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 over one third of Rome was destroyed by flames. The young Emperor Nero helped to direct the Vigiles in fighting the flames. It was rumoured that the Vigiles intentionally allowed the city to burn under orders from Nero, who later built his palace on land that was cleared by the fire. Regardless, Nero enacted fire code laws following the Great Fire to avoid further conflagrations. These laws called for more public access to water and prohibited buildings from sharing a common wall.

===Police force===
Starting about 27 BC, Augustus added a police function to the Vigiles to counterbalance the urban mobs that had run rampant during the latter days of the Republic.

In addition to extinguishing fires, the Vigiles were the nightwatch of Rome. Their duties included apprehending thieves and robbers and capturing runaway slaves. The task of guarding the baths was added as a duty of the Vigiles during the reign of Alexander Severus when the baths remained open during the night. They dealt primarily with petty crimes and looked for disturbances of the peace while they patrolled the streets. Sedition, riots and violent crimes were handled by the &quot;Cohortes urbanae&quot; and (to a lesser extent) the Praetorian Guard, though Vigiles could provide a supporting role in these situations. The &quot;Vigiles&quot; were not considered a para-military unit.

===Quarters===

The first Vigiles sequestered private homes and buildings to use as their command posts. It was not until the mid-2nd century that official stations were built explicitly for the Vigiles&#x27; use. By the early 3rd century sub-stations (&quot;excubitoria&quot;), which held forty to fifty men, were constructed to accommodate the expanding city and the surrounding suburbs.

The locations of four of the seven cohort &quot;stationes&quot; or barracks have been fairly definitively identified:
*I Cohort: On the east side of the Via Lata opposite the Saepta;
*III Cohort: On Viminal;
*IV Cohort: Near Baths of Caracalla;
*V Cohort: On Caelian Hill near present site of S. Maria in Domnica.

The VII Cohort was probably housed in a &quot;statio&quot; provisionally identified near the Aemilian Bridge.

As mentioned elsewhere detachments of watchmen were stationed at &quot;Ostia&quot; and &quot;Portus&quot; and there were sub-stations throughout the city. What arrangements were made for policing the outer suburbs of the city is not known. (Certainly after the governmental reforms of Diocletian the jurisdiction of the &quot;Praefectus Urbi&quot; extended as far as the east coast and for in every direction. This might suggest that his subordinate, the &quot;Praefectus&quot; &quot;Vigilum&quot;, had a commensurate responsibility.)

==In popular culture==
The Vigiles often play a prominent role in the Marcus Didius Falco novels of Lindsey Davis, providing assistance in Falco&#x27;s investigations. In particular, Falco&#x27;s old army friend Lucius Petronius Longus is a &#x27;Watch Captain&#x27; in &quot;Regio&quot; XIII.

In &quot;Death in Vesunna&quot; by Harry Turtledove, the vigiles of Vesunna, Roman Gaul (now modern Périgueux, France) are tasked to hunt down two murderers from the future, whose victim was a prominent citizen in the city whom they murdered with a pistol. Despite initial bafflement, the head of the vigiles is able to solve the case with help from his Greek doctor friend and arrest the murderers despite their previously unknown weapon.

<text>Najmadin Faraj Ahmad (, July 7, 1956), better known as Mullah Krekar (), is a Kurdish Sunni Islamic scholar. He was a commander for the Peshmerga unit belonging to the Kurdistan Islamic Movement during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. Later, he founded Ansar al-Islam in 2001, and left for Norway in 2003, where he founded Rawti Shax. He was arrested and is currently serving a prison sentence in Italy, after having been extradited from Norway in 2020. He came to Norway as a refugee from Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991. His wife, Rukhosh Ahmad, and his four children have Norwegian citizenship, but not Krekar himself. He speaks Kurdish, Arabic, Persian, Norwegian and English. He had no relation to Jama&#x27;at Ansar al-Islam, which emerged long after Ansar al-Islam disbanded. 

Krekar was the original leader of the Islamist armed group Ansar al-Islam, which was set up and commenced operations in Northern Iraq while he had refugee status in Norway. Krekar claims, however, not to have had foreknowledge of the various terrorist attacks performed by the group he was leading. Since February 2003 he has an expulsion order against him, which is suspended pending Iraqi government guarantees that he will not face torture or execution. Norway is committed to international treaties which prohibit the expulsion of an individual without such a guarantee.

Kurdish authorities in the Kurdistan Regional Government have repeatedly asked for Mullah Krekar to be extradited from Norway. The death penalty remains on the books in the Kurdistan region. Most death sentences have been changed into life sentences since the Kurdish authorities took power in 1992, the exception being that eleven alleged members of Ansar al-Islam were hanged in the regional capital of Erbil in October 2006. He has as of 8 December 2006 been on the UN terror list, and as of 8 November 2007 been judged by the Supreme Court of Norway as a &quot;danger to national security&quot;.

On March 26, 2012, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison for making repeated death threats against Norwegian politicians and the Kurds if they pursued certain civil actions against him. He has appealed this prison sentence. The next day, March 27, 2012, he was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) and Norwegian Police and taken into protective custody and incarceration. This occurred after certain additional statements of a threatening nature were linked to him, suggesting that others might take retaliatory actions against Norwegians if his civil prison sentence were implemented.

In 2020, he was extradited to Italy. In 2022, his 12-year prison sentence was upheld when the Italian Supreme Court rejected his appeal.

== Early life ==
Mullah Krekar joined the KDP branch of the Peshmerga in 1974. He claimed that the Kurdish resistance movement in Iraq collapsed due to the &quot;American conspiracy&quot; that forced Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to close Iranian borders to the Iraqi Kurds in 1975 and sign an agreement with Saddam Hussein in Algeria. He became religious during his stay in Erbil in 1975. He lived in Iran from 1982 to 1984. After failing sociology at the University of Tehran, he worked as an imam. He studied forensic sciences among Sunni scholars, and moved to Pakistan in 1985 to study. While in Iran, Mullah Krekar worked with a number of Kurds in Tehran to establish a jihadist organization against the regime of Saddam Hussein. He blamed the failure of the project on the Iranian government. He settled in Karachi, where he studied until the Halabja massacre, which led him to quit his studies and work as a relief volunteer at camps in Iran and Turkey. Krekar claimed that Taliban-affiliated jihadists in Peshawar raised over a hundred thousand dollars for those affected.

He returned to Iraqi Kurdistan during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings and joined the Kurdistan Islamic Movement led by Osman Abdulaziz. He became the military commander of the Kurdistan Islamic Movement until 2001 when he left it to form the Islah group, later merging with Jund al-Islam to form Ansar al-Islam. He also seized control of the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan from the IMK.

==Krekar in Norway==

===Proceedings against Krekar===
Krekar was born to a religious Sunni Kurdish family in the city of Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq. In August 2002, while Krekar was in Iraq, the Norwegian government revoked his refugee status on the grounds that he had traveled back to his homeland and spent long periods there.

Krekar was arrested in the Netherlands at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam in September 2002, after Iran denied him entry and sent him back to Europe. He was interviewed by FBI agents (at Krekar&#x27;s request, in an attempt to clear his and his group&#x27;s name); no extradition request was made. He was deported to Norway in January 2003.

In February 2003 the Norwegian government ordered Krekar to be deported to Iraq, but as of July 2009 the order had not been implemented because of the security environment in Iraq, and the risk that Krekar could face the death penalty there, as Norway will not deport people in these circumstances. Krekar has unsuccessfully challenged the expulsion order in court, with the order being confirmed in September 2005. Norway&#x27;s government has said that the new government to be elected in Iraq in December 2005 might permit discussion on whether Krekar&#x27;s expulsion order can be implemented.

On March 21, 2003 his arrest was ordered by Økokrim, the Norwegian law enforcement agency for financial crime, to ensure he did not leave the country while accusations that he had financed terrorist attacks using Norway as a base were investigated. Court proceedings against Krekar were however dropped when it proved impossible to prove his connections with the terrorist attacks staged in Iraq by Ansar al-Islam during his leadership. His term as leader ended.

The United States government has declared Ansar al-Islam a terrorist group, but Krekar denies that it was during the time he headed it, and says he no longer does. While Krekar has not been found guilty of anything, a number of his opinions have met little sympathy; he was once recorded claiming that Osama bin Laden is the &quot;jewel in the crown of Islam&quot;. and that he was proud of what Abu Musab al-Zarqawi &quot;has done and that he has become a martyr&quot;.

In September 2005 the Iraqi Justice Minister Abdel Hussein Shandal said that Krekar was wanted in Iraq and should be tried there.

About the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, he said to the Norwegian media &quot;This is a declaration of war against of our religion, our faith, and our civilization. We Muslims are ready for this.&quot;

Krekar told the Kurdish magazine Awene that he wants to return to Iraq to fight openly against the Iraqi government and the coalition, but that he lacked travel documents from the Norwegian government. He confirmed to a Norwegian newspaper that he had been correctly quoted. The Norwegian minister of labour and migration, Bjarne Håkon Hanssen, responded that Krekar could leave at any time and that he would be given &quot;travel documents within the day. He&#x27;ll also get money for airline tickets, taxi cab, and the whole deal. If he really wants to go, that is.&quot;

On December 7, 2006, the United States Department of the Treasury designated Mullah Krekar as one of five individuals providing financial support to terrorist organizations. In a statement he is accused of providing funds for Ansar al-Sunnah, an active Iraqi terror-organization descended from Ansar al-Islam. The press release states that &quot;This designation freezes any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits all financial and commercial transactions by any U.S. person with the designees&quot;. Mullah Krekar was later that day added to the United Nations Security Council list of individuals belonging to or associated with the Al-Qaeda organization. All member states of the United Nations are obliged to freeze assets and prevent entry or transit through their territories with regard to the individuals included on the list. Anders Romarheim, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, believes that the placement of Mullah Krekar on this list is a United States strategy to put pressure on Norway.

On November 8, 2007, the Supreme Court of Norway ruled that Krekar is a threat to Norway&#x27;s national security, thus upholding the February 2003 decision by the government to deport him to Iraq. It is still unclear when Krekar will be deported due to Iraq&#x27;s death penalty laws. Some politicians asked for Krekar to be put in jail until he is deported.

===Threat against Mariwan Halabjaee===
In an audio file published on the Kurdish website Renesans.nu during September 2008, Krekar allegedly threatened to kill Mariwan Halabjaee, the Iraqi Kurdish author of Sex, Sharia and Women in the History of Islam, who also resided in Norway. &quot;I swear that we will not live if you live. Either you go before us, or we go before you,&quot; said Krekar. Krekar compared Halabjaee with Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

In February 2012, Krekar confirmed in the Oslo District Court that he had issued a twenty-page fatwa against Halabjaee. The fatwa was sent to several hundred Islamic scholars around the world. While Krekar said he thought he might be able to &quot;guarantee the safety&quot; of Halabjaee, Krekar confirmed that his fatwa &quot;implies&quot; that it is &quot;permissible&quot; to kill Halabjaee in Oslo or anywhere else. Krekar compared Halabjaee to Theo van Gogh, the film director who was killed by an Islamist in the Netherlands in 2004.

===Terrorism charges against Krekar===

On July 12, 2011, terrorism charges were filed against Krekar for a death threat he uttered against ex-minister Erna Solberg during a news conference in June 2010.

=== Allegations of a U.S. plan to seize Krekar ===
In 2003, agents for the CIA, including Cynthia Dame Logan and Gregory Asherleighs, were sent to Norway.
They arrived directly after the abduction of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr from Milan, Italy. A few days before their arrival, Mullah Krekar&#x27;s lawyer, Brynjar Meling, asked for police protection of Krekar. The Norwegian Intelligence Service admits it had knowledge of the agents&#x27; visit to Norway, and Meling confirms he had heard rumours that Krekar was to be kidnapped and transferred to Guantanamo Bay. If the operation was not approved beforehand by Norway it would have been a violation of Norwegian law. Mullah Krekar was not kidnapped. According to an article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, a Pentagon official proposed inserting a US Navy SEAL team to engage in a &quot;snatch rope&quot; operation against Krekar; however, the plan was allegedly rejected because a shooting confrontation between the SEALs and Norwegian police would have triggered a diplomatic disaster between Norway and the United States.

However, a week later the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; quoted a high ranking intelligence official who claimed that U.S. special forces were in fact inserted in a European country allied with the United States through NATO, in order to carry out a snatch operation under strikingly similar circumstances to the Krekar case. The revelation led to suspicion that the plan was in fact not cancelled, as the Pentagon had stated. According to the Norwegian newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad, which was the original source of the CIA agents&#x27; mission in Oslo, the U.S. special forces, most likely Navy SEALs, had been monitoring a &quot;militant leader&quot; over a period of time, and were in place ready to carry out the snatch. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Pentagon kept the allied country&#x27;s government in the dark about the mission, which apparently failed or was aborted.
===Facebook group collecting donations for the assassination of Mullah Krekar===
In November 2007, Norwegian newspapers published the story that a Facebook group had been set up, dedicated to collecting money which would eventually go to an assassin, should one be located. The group statement started with &quot;For the murder of Norway&#x27;s enemy #1&quot;. The 28-year-old man who started the group went on to publicize not only his full name, but also a bank account number where money could be deposited. The group had approximately 400 members when Krekar&#x27;s lawyer deemed the threat &quot;serious&quot; and said he &quot;hoped the police would investigate the people involved&quot;. The 28-year-old told Norwegian media that the statement was facetious and thus should not be taken literally.

===Assassination attempt===
During the night of 24 January 2010, 3 shots were fired through one of the windows of Krekar&#x27;s apartment in Oslo. The attack was investigated as an assassination attempt. Krekar&#x27;s son-in-law was mildly injured by one of the bullets. Kurdish groups were cited as possible or likely perpetrators.

===Decision to leave Norway===
In early January 2012, Krekar announced in an interview with a Kurdish online newspaper Rudaw from the Kurdish Autonomous Region that he would be leaving Norway and returning to the Kurdistan region soon, saying &quot;My return to the Kurdistan region has become a major political issue.&quot; He also predicted that, &quot;My death will cost Norwegian society. If, for example, Erna Solberg (Norwegian Prime Minister) throws me out of the country and I die as a result, she will suffer the same fate.&quot;

===Conviction for death threats===
On 26 March 2012, Krekar was sentenced to 5 years in prison for making death threats. He appealed. On 26 March 2012, Krekar was re-arrested for making threats against two Kurds and the Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg. On August 29, 2012, Oslo District Court tacked an additional year onto the five Mullah Krekar had been sentenced to in March 2012.

===Decision on appeal===
On 6 December 2012, the Court of Appeal acquitted Krekar of charges of incitement to terrorism, but found Krekar guilty of four counts of intimidation under aggravating circumstances. The Court of Appeal ordered that Krekar pay 130,000 kroner in damages compensation to each of the three Kurds he threatened, and to serve two years and ten months in prison, less the 255 days he was in custody.

===Political advocacy===
For the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election Krekar called on Muslims in Norway to vote for either the Labour Party, the Socialist Left Party or the Red Party. He explained that since there was not yet enough Muslims in Norway to form a separate political bloc, Muslims had many strategies in common with Norwegian leftists.

===Relocation===
On 20 January 2015, it was revealed that Krekar would be forcibly relocated () to the village of Kyrksæterøra in Trøndelag. This decision was made by the Police based on an order from the National Police Directorate.

===February 2015 arrest===
On 20 February 2015, it was reported that Krekar had been arrested. Krekar is quoted in this article saying that when a cartoonist &quot;tramples on our dignity, our principles and our faith, he must die.&quot; The aforementioned article also reports that, &quot;Krekar, who was only freed from prison late last month, was arrested Thursday night on accusations of inciting crime, police said.&quot; Therefore, the primary reason for Krekar&#x27;s arrest by the Norwegian Police was the allegation that he incited crime by his statements. The article cites no other reason for Krekar&#x27;s arrest.

Krekar&#x27;s statements refer to the Charlie Hebdo newspaper whose cartoonists were gunned down in Paris for allegedly drawing cartoons that Kreker refers to. The attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris was described by the French President François Hollande who said, &quot;An act of exceptional barbarism has been committed in Paris against a newspaper. A paper, in other words, an organ of free speech.&quot;

===November 2015 arrest===
On 13 November 2015 it was reported that Krekar was arrested in prison in Norway on 11 November &quot;in a coordinated police swoop on Islamist militants planning attacks.&quot; He and 14 other Iraqi Kurds and one Kosovar Albanian, were &quot;arrested in countries across Europe in collaboration with police from Italy, the UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland.&quot; The BBC reported that the raids targeted Rawti Shax, an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-linked jihadist network suspected to be led by Krekar. According to the investigation, Krekar pledged allegiance to ISIL in 2014.

===November 2016 arrest===
On 23 November 2016 the Norwegian Police Security Service arrested Krekar in order to secure his extradition to Italy. 30 November 2016, it was reported that Italy had withdrawn their extradition claim, and Krekar was released from prison.

===July 2019 arrest===
In July 2019, it was reported that Krekar was arrested in Oslo. His arrest was requested by Italian authorities as they suspected that he has led Rawti Shax, an offshoot on Ansar al-Islam. A court in Bolzano, Italy sentenced him to 12 years in prison in absentia. Italy has requested his extradition with the intent of deporting him to Iraqi Kurdistan. Krekar has denied the charges against him, calling the case &quot;fake&quot;.

== Italy ==
He is being held at a prison in Milan (as of 2021).

=== Rawti Shax terrorist cell trial ===
In 2019, Krekar was found to be the leader of the jihadi defence cell Rawti Shax and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The guilty verdict and the sentence were upheld in a trial in Bolzano.

===Extradition to Italy===
On 26 March 2020, it was announced that Mullah Krekar had been extradited from Norway to Italy, where he will be sentenced to jail for leading a jihadist network. His lawyer Brynjar Meling was deeply upset about this turn of events, citing his client&#x27;s poor health (which include both diabetes and high blood pressure), the coronavirus pandemic in Italy and the subpar condition of the Rebibbia prison, which had recently seen both a mutiny and several deaths owing to the COVID-19 virus. He [was previously] held in the Badu &#x27;e Carros prison in Nuoro, Sardinia.

==Krekar&#x27;s views==
In November 2009, controversy erupted when Krekar in an interview with the Arab television channel al-Hiwar said that for there is no legitimate Islamic state with the exception of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. He claimed that if a caliphate were to be established, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Gulbuddin Hekmatyar should be leader. As a result, the Progress Party continued their call for the imprisonment of Krekar, and the Labour Party stated for the first time they would form a new task force which would examine if people officially labeled as &quot;danger to national security&quot; could be imprisoned. Azzam Tamimi, who interviewed Mullah Krekar, also said that he felt Mullah Krekar was mistreated by secular Kurds in Norway.

Mullah Krekar is significantly nationalist. He said he would support Kurdish independence &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; even though he has lost faith in Kurdish parties, but he &quot;has no quarrel with any political party&quot;. He also stated that many of his relatives and friends are members of the KDP and the PUK, and that he had no issues with either party. Hoshyar Zebari announced that the Kurdistan Regional Government had no issues with Mullah Krekar, and did not charge him. In 2001, Mullah Krekar seized control of the unstable Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan and declared independence. The emirate was treated as a Kurdish state under Islamic law, rather than an Islamic state composed of Kurds. Mullah Krekar claimed that the Muslim community criticized Kurds for being secular, yet also failed to support Kurds who fought from a religious standpoint, such as Sheikh Said, Mahmud Barzinji, and himself. When the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan was dissolved, the majority of Ansar al-Islam fled to Iran and lived among local Kurds. Mullah Krekar refused to work with Iraqi jihadists, as many of them were former Ba&#x27;athist officers. He called on Ansar al-Islam to be lenient on captured PUK soldiers, claiming that they were still Kurds and had nothing to do with the PUK leaders. He questioned PUK commitment to Kurdish nationalism, claiming that no Kurdish nationalist would invite the United States to defeat the only independent Kurdish state. Mullah Krekar also claimed that if the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan lived longer, an Ansar al-Islam operation against Turkey would have been inevitable.

In May 2019, due to increased tensions between the United States and Iran, Krekar stated in a war between the two he would support Iran, saying it was like supporting Hezbollah in a war between them and Israel, despite being Shiite and actively fighting Sunni groups in Iraq and Syria.

== In popular culture ==
In November 2007, Mullah Krekar was the subject of a half-hour investigative report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC-TV) international affairs program &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;. The report, titled &quot;Norwegian Jihad&quot;, was also the centrepiece of a one-hour special report on Norwegian State Television. &quot;Norwegian Jihad&quot; was also broadcast throughout the Asia Pacific region on ABC-TV&#x27;s satellite service &quot;Australia Network&quot;.

In July 2009, Mullah Krekar was one of the subjects of the NBC&#x27;s pilot episode of the show &quot;The Wanted&quot;, describing him as &quot;responsible for killing hundreds of westerners&quot;.

In early 2012, the Netflix series &quot;Lillyhammer&quot; featured a scene in which a Norwegian police officer gets into an argument with an Arab immigrant over whether the show &quot;24&quot; is unfair to Arabs, and when his partner intercedes, he complains that the immigrant &quot;is giving me the whole Mullah Krekar routine over here&quot;.

<text>[[Ubangi-Shari]] () was a French colony in central Africa which later became the independent country of the Central African Republic on August 13, 1960. It followed the establishment of the Bangui outpost in 1889, and was named in 1894.

==Colonial history==

The French did not establish a colonial administration until 1903, upon defeating Egyptian forces (the territory was claimed by the Egyptian Sultan). In 1906, the French settlements around Lake Chad were merged with Ubangi-Shari to form Ubangi-Shari-Chad (&quot;Oubangui-Chari-Tchad&quot;). In 1910, French Equatorial Africa was formed consisting of the four territories: Chad, Ubangi-Shari, Middle Congo, and Gabon. In 1915, Ubangi-Shari-Chad was made into an autonomous civilian colony. Chad was separated in 1920.

==Postal history==
Military postal service began at Bangui in 1893, at Fort Possel in 1894, and was gradually extended along the Ubangi River and northwards into the country during the 1900s. Civilian mail used postage stamps of Middle Congo (&quot;Moyen Congo&quot;) from 1907.

In 1915, Middle Congo stamps were overprinted &quot;OUBANGUI-CHARI-TCHAD&quot; for use in Ubangi-Shari-Chad, and then in 1922 just &quot;OUBANGUI-CHARI&quot; after Chad obtained its stamps. In 1924, stamps were issued with the additional overprint &quot;AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE FRANCAISE&quot;. A number of those were surcharged with new values between 1925 and 1927.

In 1928, postage due stamps of France were overprinted &quot;OUBANGUI-CHARI / A. E. F.&quot;, followed in 1930 by a set of 11 postage dues issued specifically for the colony; printed in two colors, the lower values depicted a landscape, and the higher values Émile Gentil.

A 1931 set of four stamps for the Colonial Exposition was the last to be produced for the territory; from 1936 on, French Equatorial Africa issues were used until 1959.

<doc id="1165635" wikidata="Q716206" url="?curid=1165635" title="Sun Moon Lake">
<text>Sun Moon Lake (; Thao: &quot;Zintun&quot;) is a lake in Yuchi Township, Nantou County, Taiwan. It is the largest body of water in Taiwan. The area around the lake is home to the Thao tribe, one of Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal tribes. Sun Moon Lake surrounds a tiny island called Lalu. The east side of the lake resembles a sun while the west side resembles a moon, hence the name.

Sun Moon Lake is located above sea level. It is deep and has a surface area of approximately . The area surrounding the lake has many trails for hiking.

While swimming in Sun Moon Lake is usually not permitted, there is an annual 3-km race called the &quot;Swimming Carnival of Sun Moon Lake&quot; held around the Mid-Autumn Festival each year. The Sun Moon Lake Swimming Carnival was launched in 1983 and is listed among the Top 50 Open Water Swims in Asia and the Top 100 Open Water Swims of the World. Everyone over 10 years old and with the ability to swim long distances can join, regardless of nationality. In recent years, the participants have numbered in the tens of thousands. Other festivities held at the same time include fireworks, laser shows, and concerts.

The lake and its surrounding countryside have been designated one of thirteen national scenic areas in Taiwan. Wen Wu Temple was built after rising water levels from building a dam forced several smaller temples to be removed. Tzu-En Pagoda () was ordered constructed by late President Chiang Kai-shek in 1971 in memory of his mother. Other temples of note include Jianjing Temple, Syuentzang Temple () and Syuanguang Temple ().

==History==

In older English literature, it was commonly referred to as Lake Candidius after the 17th-century Dutch missionary Georgius Candidius. In the middle of the lake is the Lalu Island, which is considered holy ground by the Thao tribe. In legend, Thao hunters discovered Sun Moon Lake while chasing a white deer through the surrounding mountains. The deer eventually led them to the lake, which they found to be not only beautiful, but abundant with fish. Today, the white deer of legends is immortalized as a marble statue on Lalu Island.

Under Japanese rule, the island was renamed . After Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan, the island was renamed &quot;Kwanghwa Island&quot; () and in 1978 the local government built a pavilion where annual weddings took place. In 1999, the 921 earthquake destroyed the pavilion and sank most of the island. In recent years, due to increasing social and political awareness, more deference and recognition are being given to Taiwanese aborigines. As a result, after the 921 earthquake, the island was renamed in the Thao language as &quot;Lalu&quot;.

Several hydroelectric power plants have been built in the Sun Moon Lake since 1919, including Mingtan Pumped Storage Hydro Power Plant and Minhu Pumped Storage Hydro Power Station. When the first hydroelectric plant was finished in 1934, it was considered to be one of the most important infrastructure constructions of the time. Wujie Dam, also completed in 1934, diverts water from the Zhuoshui River to increase hydroelectric generation at the lake. The Jiji Line railroad was built to facilitate the construction.

==Transportation==

There are three ferry piers on the lake to serve ferries on the lake; they are Shuishe Pier, Xuanguang Pier and Ita Thao Pier. There is also a local bus service that goes around the lake with stops at major points along the perimeter of the lake.

The lake is accessible by bus from Taichung HSR station or Taichung TRA station. It is also accessible by bus from near Checheng railway station on the Jiji branch line.
The Sun Moon Lake Ropeway, located at the edge of the lake, connects it with the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village.

==Wildlife==
The lake is a productive aquatic ecosystem. Introduced giant snakehead pose a challenge to the ecological balance of the lake and are a threat to native fish and shrimp species. The Nantou County Bureau of Agricultural Affairs has in place an eradication program for the species which attempts to electrofish schools of juvenile fish.

==PRC passport==
The depiction of Sun Moon Lake is featured in the newly-issued People&#x27;s Republic of China passport in 2012, a move that has triggered protest from Taipei to Beijing.

<text>Lieutenant Fitz Henry Babbitt (10 October 1790 – 15 January 1815) was an officer of the United States Navy who served during the War of 1812, and was killed during the capture of USS &quot;President&quot;.

==Biography==
Babbitt was probably born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, and was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on 2 April 1804. He accepted his warrant on 28 May 1804 and entered into service on board the 32-gun frigate , that same day. He served in &quot;Essex&quot; and in the bomb ketch in the Mediterranean Sea between 1804 and 1806. Returning home to the United States in &quot;Spitfire&quot; in August 1806, Babbitt joined the frigate in 1807 and had charge of her quarterdeck guns on the occasion of the battle with on 22 June 1807. He was appointed an acting lieutenant and ordered to the brig on 1 February 1810. He cruised the waters along the east coast of the United States in &quot;Argus&quot; until late October, at which time he was furloughed. Babbitt received his lieutenant&#x27;s commission on 4 March 1811, with seniority to date from 5 June 1810.

On 19 February 1812, he received orders to join and served in her until 17 July 1812 when a British squadron – built around the 64-gun ship-of-the-line and the frigates and – captured &quot;Nautilus&quot; off the northern New Jersey coast. Babbitt spent several weeks as a prisoner of war in Halifax, Nova Scotia, before being exchanged. Following his return, he was assigned to the frigate on 30 November 1812 and helped in the futile effort to get that ship ready for sea after her modification into a sloop of war. Though the work was completed by the end of 1812, the British had &quot;Adams&quot; blockaded in Chesapeake Bay by then, and she remained so until early in 1814. Babbitt&#x27;s assignment to &quot;Adams&quot;, however, lasted only until the spring of 1813. On 6 April 1813, he received orders to join the frigate ; but those orders were apparently changed later in the month, and he went to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor along with the officers and men of the blockaded &quot;Adams&quot;. In September 1813, Babbitt again received orders to &quot;United States&quot; to serve as that ship&#x27;s first lieutenant. &quot;United States&quot;, however, languished at New London – along with her recent prize, , by then also in American service, and the sloop of war – under a blockade imposed by a powerful British squadron.

In the spring of 1814, the frigate&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Stephen Decatur, received a posting to command the 44-gun frigate , and took the crew of &quot;United States&quot; with him to man his new command. Thus, Babbitt came to be &quot;President&quot;″s first lieutenant. Once again, Babbitt found himself assigned to a warship unable to get to sea because of a strong blockade. The frigate remained hemmed in at New York for the rest of 1814. Not until January 1815 did conditions allow &quot;President&quot; to attempt her escape to sea. Though the peace treaty had been signed in Ghent, Belgium, in December 1814, word had not reached the Americas, and hostilities continued in the western hemisphere for some weeks. Thus, when &quot;President&quot; made her move for the open sea, British warships stood ready to engage her. In her breakout attempt on 14 January 1815, &quot;President&quot; ran afoul of another squadron of British ships comprising , , and .

During the ensuing fight, &quot;President&quot; managed to inflict sufficient damage on HMS &quot;Endymion&quot; to force her out of the struggle, but the unequal contest exacted a greater toll from the American ship. Unable to outrun her other adversaries because of hull damage sustained during a grounding soon after sailing, &quot;President&quot; finally succumbed to the combined attention of the three remaining British ships after a six-hour exchange in which she lost 24 of her crewmen and three of her lieutenants, including Babbitt.

==Namesake==
The destroyer (1919–1946) was named for him.

<doc id="1165656" wikidata="Q5288410" url="?curid=1165656" title="Dogpatch">
<text>Dogpatch was the fictional setting of cartoonist Al Capp&#x27;s classic comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1934–1977).

== &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip ==

The inhabitants of Dogpatch were mostly lazy hillbillies, who usually wanted nothing to do with progress. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; backwater hometown chiefly consisted of dismal log cabin hovels, pine trees, &quot;tarnip&quot; fields and hog wallows—and was often referred to by its inhabitants and outsiders as being the most miserable and unnecessary place on earth. The menfolk were too lazy to work, yet Dogpatch gals were desperate enough to chase them (see Sadie Hawkins Day). Those who farmed their turnip fields watched turnip termites swarm by the billions once a year, locust-like, to devour Dogpatch&#x27;s only crop (along with their livestock and all their clothing).

Al Capp used to joke that Dogpatch was based on Seabrook, New Hampshire, where he would vacation with his wife, Catherine. A map shown during the story arc of the Shmoo seems to place Dogpatch somewhere around Tennessee or Arkansas. However, one of the earliest (1934) &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; strips, re-posted on the web by Comics.com in March 2008, explicitly identifies Dogpatch as being in Kentucky and several 1936 strips also clearly place it in Kentucky. One 1936 strip furthermore mentions that Lee City (a small town in eastern Kentucky) is just over away.
The local geography was fluid and vividly complex; Capp continually changed it to suit either his whims or the current storyline. It has been variously situated in a deep valley, at the base of a peak that&#x27;s precariously balancing an enormous boulder (Teeterin&#x27; Rock), or atop Onnecessary Mountain overlooking an apparently infinite chasm, Bottomless Canyon. It was usually described as situated between the equally fictitious towns of Skonk Hollow (inhabited by lethally dangerous, even more backward mountaineers) and Pineapple Junction. Like the Coconino County depicted in George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and the Okefenokee Swamp of Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;, Dogpatch&#x27;s (and Lower Slobbovia&#x27;s) distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters.

Local Dogpatch institutions included West Po&#x27;kchop Railroad, which ran perpendicularly up one side of Onnecessary Mountain and straight down the other. A stiffnecked industrialist named Stubborn J. Tolliver built its suicidal grade to satisfy a boyish dream of his son, Idiot J. Tolliver. To keep his boy happy, Tolliver starts one train a week up the tracks. Each train falls back with a crash, killing all its passengers.
Another daily hazard, the Skonk Works, was almost as lethal. Scores have been done in by the fumes of the concentrated &quot;skonk&quot; oil which is brewed and barreled at the factory by its owner and &quot;inside man&quot;, Big Barnsmell; and his cousin, &quot;outside man&quot; Barney Barnsmell (see also Skunk Works). 

Mail was very slow, with the ancient, white-bearded postmaster and his creaky jackass mount (Young Eddie McSkonk and U.S. Mule) often feeling too stressed to deliver the cobweb-covered sacks of timeworn letters marked &quot;Rush&quot; at the Dogpatch Express post office. Dogpatch&#x27;s various feature attractions also included Kissin&#x27; Rock (handy to Suicide Cliff), the Jubilation T. Cornpone memorial statue, and Dogpatch Airlines, with decrepit World War I aviator Cap&#x27;n Eddie Ricketyback, proprietor (a pun on Eddie Rickenbacker).

== Theme park ==
In 1967, Al Capp licensed and had an interest in an $35 million theme park called Dogpatch USA in Marble Falls near Harrison, Arkansas, based on the comic strip&#x27;s setting and featuring a trout farm, buggy and horseback rides, entertainment by characters from the Li&#x27;l Abner comic strip, and eventually amusement rides. Opening in 1968, the park had 300,000 visitors in its first year.

The park closed in 1993 due to mismanagement and financial debt. It had been scheduled to reopen as Heritage USA Ozarks Resort in 2020, but in 2020 it was sold to Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris for $1.12 million, to become &quot;a nature experience for future generations to enjoy.&quot; Morris is reportedly interested in &quot;restoration of the large natural spring and bringing back to life the renowned trout hatchery and many future fishing opportunities.&quot;

== Other uses ==
*U.S. Army and Marine Corps units in Vietnam during the Vietnam War often called their housing compounds &quot;Dogpatches&quot;, due to the primitive conditions.
*The term was used by American chemical engineers such as William J. Wilcox, Jr. and Warren Fuchs, during World War II who were working on the Manhattan Project; the engineers used the term from the comic strip to describe their first Rochester dormitories, with dark and dismal furniture and used beds from an old YMCA, and kept using the term when they transferred to Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
*47th Fighter Squadron is known as the DogPatchers, and their A-10C aircraft are named after the characters from &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Each airplane has artwork depicting these characters located on the inside of the boarding ladder door.
*Dogpatch is also the name of a restaurant in Munising, Michigan, United States.
*Various cities and towns have neighborhoods, often lower social class, nicknamed &quot;Dogpatch&quot; in reference to the comic strip&#x27;s locale, including 
**Marble Falls, Arkansas
**Dogpatch, San Francisco
**Dog Patch, West Virginia
**Edmonton
**Greater Sudbury
**Calgary

<doc id="1165657" wikidata="Q3410050" url="?curid=1165657" title="Psycho Beach Party">
<text>Psycho Beach Party is a 2000 comedy horror film based on the off-Broadway play of the same name, directed by Robert Lee King. Charles Busch wrote both the original play and the screenplay. As the title suggests, &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot;, set in 1962 Malibu Beach, is a parody of 1950s psychodramas, 1960s beach movies, and 1980s slasher films.

In the film, a female surfer with multiple personalities is suspected to be the serial killer responsible for the latest series of murders in Malibu, California.

==Plot==
Florence Forrest is a Gidget-like character determined to learn to surf, and earns the nickname &quot;Chicklet&quot; from the surfer guys. Chicklet, though, begins displaying multiple personalities, experiences inexplicable blackouts, and fears that she might be the one responsible for a series of mysterious murders in her beachside town. The deaths are investigated by Captain Monica Stark, who also suspects Chicklet&#x27;s mother, Chicklet&#x27;s best friend Berdine, surfing guru the Great Kanaka, and B-movie actress Bettina Barnes.

Other characters include university dropout (and Chicklet&#x27;s love interest) Starcat, Swedish exchange student Lars, surfers Yo-Yo and Provoloney, Starcat&#x27;s girlfriend Marvel Ann, and the class queen bee Rhonda.

==Cast==
==Play and productions==
The play was originally entitled &quot;Gidget Goes Psychotic&quot;, but the title was changed due to concerns about copyright. In the original 1987 production, Charles Busch played the role of Chicklet. Deciding that he might not be believable in the role of a 16-year-old girl (&quot;while I can still manage, with the aid of a sympathetic cameraman, to play a sophisticated 25, 16 would be a stretch&quot;), he added the character of Monica Stark to the movie.

After over 20 years, the play had its premiere UK production by Vertigo Theatre Productions in Manchester in March 2011. The production returned in August 2012 at Sacha&#x27;s Hotel Ballroom. A production was held in Australia at the Bondi Pavilion Theatre from November to December 2012; productions also ran in Melbourne (notably at the Midsumma Festival) in early 2013, receiving generally positive reviews.

The Essendon Theatre Company in Melbourne, Australia, held another production of &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot; beginning in March 2021.

==Reception==
, the film holds a 55% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews with an average rating of 5.55/10.

In a positive review, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that the film &quot;accomplishes what no stage production could. By assiduously copying the look and sound of those &#x27;60s movies -- the wriggling title sequences, the twangy surf music, and the gawky gee-whiz screen acting style -- it definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge. Most of the play&#x27;s subversive humor has arrived on the screen intact.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kevin Thomas compared the film unfavorably to its source material, opining that it &quot;has to be twice as funny a play as it is as a movie&quot;; he further explains that &quot;deliberate camp like this film presents a special challenge: It must generate and sustain a high level of energy or it will swiftly fall flat. The latter is too often the case here.&quot;

Praising the &quot;strong women&quot; of the film, Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also wrote that Busch (as Monica Stark) &quot;captures the woman-alone-in-the-world toughness of the roles played by the stars he loves. It goes beyond camp. He is sincere.&quot; However, Graham reasoned that the film has &quot;rough edges&quot;, despite conceding that &quot;they probably work to this larky, cheeky picture&#x27;s advantage&quot;. He subsequently notes, &quot;In some instances, it&#x27;s hard to tell the really bad acting from the intentionally bad acting.&quot; Dennis Lim of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was negative, concluding that the film is an &quot;awkward combination of garish set decoration and muffled humor&quot; and that &quot;the viewer is left to ponder the number of levels on which this counts as a pointless exercise—a parody of parodic movies, a deconstruction of transparent genres, [and] a self-negatingly knowing example of camp&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
The original motion-picture soundtrack for &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot; was released by Nettwerk Records under the Unforscene Music imprint on September 12, 2000.

<text>Brisbane is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southeastern part of the Moon, to the south of the crater Peirescius. To the northwest lie the craters Vega and Reimarus, and farther to the east is the walled plain Lyot. Due to its proximity to the limb, foreshortening of this crater causes it to appear somewhat elliptical in shape, even though it is actually circular.

This is an old, eroded crater with features that have become somewhat softened and rounded due to a history of subsequent minor impacts. There are small craterlets along the rim, most notably along the western wall and the northeast inner wall. There is also a groove overlying the southwest rim. The interior floor is nearly level and contains no significant impacts. There is a slight central rise at the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brisbane.

<text>The Ewald sphere is a geometric construction used in electron, neutron, and x-ray diffraction which shows the relationship between: 
* the wavevector of the incident and diffracted beams, 
* the diffraction angle for a given reflection, 
* the reciprocal lattice of the crystal.

It was conceived by Paul Peter Ewald, a German physicist and crystallographer. Ewald himself spoke of the sphere of reflection. It is often simplified to the two-dimensional &quot;Ewald&#x27;s circle&quot; model or may be referred to as the Ewald sphere.

== Ewald construction ==

A crystal can be described as a lattice of atoms, which in turn leads to the reciprocal lattice. With electrons, neutrons or x-rays there is diffraction by the atoms, and if there is an incident plane wave formula_1 with a wavevector formula_2, there will be outgoing wavevectors formula_3 and formula_4 as shown in the diagram after the wave has been diffracted by the atoms.

The energy of the waves (electron, neutron or x-ray) depends upon the magnitude of the wavevector, so if there is no change in energy (elastic scattering) these have the same magnitude, that is they must all lie on the Ewald sphere. In the Figure the red dot is the origin for the wavevectors, the black spots are reciprocal lattice points (vectors) and shown in blue are three wavevectors. For the wavevector formula_3 the corresponding reciprocal lattice point formula_6 lies on the Ewald sphere, which is the condition for Bragg diffraction. For formula_4 the corresponding reciprocal lattice point formula_8 is off the Ewald sphere, so formula_9 where formula_10 is called the excitation error. The amplitude and also intensity of diffraction into the wavevector formula_4 depends upon the Fourier transform of the shape of the sample, the excitation error formula_10, the structure factor for the relevant reciprocal lattice vector, and also whether the scattering is weak or strong. For neutrons and x-rays the scattering is generally weak so there is mainly Bragg diffraction, but it is much stronger for electron diffraction.

<text>Breislak is a lunar impact crater that lies within one crater diameter north-northwest of the crater Baco, in the southern part of the Moon. To the north-northwest is the crater Barocius, and to the west lies Clairaut. This crater was named in honor of geologist Scipione Breislak.

The rim of Breislak has been heavily worn by subsequent impacts, and several small craterlets lie along the outer wall. One of these craters has cut a notch in the southeast wall, and there are craterlets to the northeast and southwest of this break. A small crater lies on the inner face of the northern wall. The inner surface is roughly level, but pock-marked by several tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Breislak.

<text>Brenner is an old lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southeastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is named after the Serbian-Austrian astronomer Spiridon Gopčević (who was also a publicist under the pen name of Leo Brenner). It is located within one crater diameter northwest of the crater pair Metius and Fabricius.

This ancient formation has been deeply eroded by subsequent impacts, to the point where only the western part still resembles a crater. That face has the most intact part of the rim, although it has been worn down until it forms a low ridge in the surface. The northeast part of the crater has been reshaped until it is little more than a rough, irregular part of the terrain. The southeastern rim is overlain by a relatively old crater designated Brenner A.

<text>Bouguer is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southern edge of the Mare Frigoris, to the north of the crater Bianchini. To the west-southwest of Bouguer, along the same shore of the mare, is the crater Foucault. Nearly due west is the more prominent Harpalus, and to the west is La Condamine.

This is a relatively young crater with well-defined edge. The formation is relatively circular, but there are slight outward bulges to the east, north-northwest, and southwest. There is some evidence of slumping in the eastern bulge. The interior floor occupies about half the crater diameter, and is relatively level and featureless.

<doc id="1165690" wikidata="Q7096975" url="?curid=1165690" title="Operation Desert Scorpion">
<text>Operation Desert Scorpion was a major U.S. operation to identify and eliminate anti-coalition forces while simultaneously delivering humanitarian aid. The area of operation was mainly in north-central Iraq and was conducted between 15 and 29 June 2003. The stated task and purpose of Operation Desert Scorpion was to defeat remaining enemy non-compliant forces. It was planned as a major operation supporting the first &quot;post-hostilities&quot; campaign plan which had been issued just a week prior to its inception.

==Background==
The operation followed Operation Peninsula Strike, which had ended three days earlier, and was part of a U.S response to a major spike in attacks by anti-coalition forces that began in late May 2003. Operation Peninsula Strike was a 4th Infantry Division operation and was directly influenced by earlier warning orders of Operation Desert Scorpion. This operation was supported from Camp Spearhead Kuwait, by the 149th Transportation Company (POCC), 10th Transportation BN (TML), 7th Transportation GRP (COMP).

==The operation==
Combined Joint Task Force 7 conducted the operation that included elements from the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, 1st Armored Division, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. The scheme of maneuver was first to gain intelligence to identify those elements, or forces, in Iraq that were preventing the establishment of interim governing capability. Simultaneously, the operation was to identify those elements who were supporting governance and stability in Iraq, and identify public works projects that would enable their efforts. The operation was designed to commence with country wide operations that defeated those remaining non – compliant forces while simultaneously providing funds and projects to those areas, and local leaders, who supported the growth of Iraqi governance and stability.

The 3rd Infantry Division conducted five raids and detained 20. The 3ID also seized 20 anti-tank rounds, three AK-47s, one Rocket propelled grenade and some C4 explosives along with detonators. The 3ID&#x27;s humanitarian contributions to the operation included coordinating a trash collection service and removing 64 loads of trash from Fallujah and continued to work with the municipality to re-establish a waste collection system.

The 4th Infantry Division conducted 43 raids in an area ranging from Kirkuk in the north to Taji in the south and initially detained 288 individuals. Sixty-five of the detained were held. The unit seized three AK-47s, one mortar site and one Dragunov night sight. The division also placed a contract for playground equipment and a retaining wall for a school in their area, assisted a general hospital with $1,000 drug and supply purchase and purchased an ambulance.

Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division conducted three raids and detained 12 individuals. The 101st Airborne Division also worked to rebuild drainage ditches and renovating the mayor&#x27;s office in Makhmur, along with rebuilding at kindergarten schools.

The 1st Armored Division executed offensive actions in Baghdad conducting six raids and detaining 22 individuals. The unit seized nine rifles, eight pistols, three knives, two boxes of grenades, one bomb and three 127mm rounds.

The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment conducted 11 raids and detained 39 individuals. It also passed out school supplies to the local schools in the eastern part of Iraq.

==Aftermath==
During the raids, two former Iraqi generals turned themselves in, Maj. Gen. Abdul Ali Jasmin, secretary of the Defense Ministry, and Brig. Gen. Abdullah Ali Jasmin, head of the Iraqi Military Academy and were detained for questioning. Operation Desert Scorpion also resulted in the seizure of eight million Dollars as well as a large sum of British pounds and Euros.

In addition to the 1,330 suspects being detained, 497 AK-47s, 235 hand grenades, 124 RPGs, 22 belt-fed machine guns, 130 pistols, 100 rifles, 8,122 rounds and ammunition were also seized.

Unfortunately, the operation did not achieve the desired effects. It was hampered initially by a failure to provide for the public works projects so critical to its success. While the Divisions&#x27; submitted a total of approximately $53 million in requirements, only some $20 million were funded. Thus, the force did not achieve its aim to publicly demonstrate commitment to rewarding those who supported stability in Iraq. As well, the force did not allow time to develop the intelligence required to find, target and then attack the leaders of local insurgent movements. However, the legacy of Operation Desert Scorpion is still seen today in operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It has become a pattern for operations in both theaters.

<text>Blackett is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, behind the southwest limb. It lies beyond the southeast outer ring of the immense Mare Orientale basin. The formation of that major feature has left Blackett deeply marked with ridge features trending from the northwest. Much of the crater has been shaped by the ejecta from Mare Orientale, particularly along the western half of the crater.

Overall this crater is heavily eroded, with several craters overlaying the southern rim, and smaller formations overlaying the western and northwestern rim. The interior floor has been roughened by ejecta, leaving only parts of the southwest interior in their previous relatively level and featureless condition.

The crater Stetson lies on the southwest rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Blackett.

<text>Non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost refers to the one-time cost to research, design, develop and test a new product or product enhancement. When budgeting for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be profitable. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike production costs, which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of fixed cost in economics terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost.

NRE can be also budgeted and paid via another commercial term called Royalty Fee. The Royalty Fee could be a percentage of sales revenue or profit or combination of these two, which have to be incorporated in a mid to long term agreement between technology supplier and the OEM.

In a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project&#x27;s costs, this can also be called research and development (R&amp;D). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from reserves, possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects.

NRE can also be explained as engineering service. Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) refers to professional services activities associated with the initial development, design, and implementation of a product or system. These services typically include:

* Planning and project management
* Configuration and customization
* Modification of existing designs or systems
* Integration of components or subsystems
* Engineering and design work
* Quality assurance and testing

NRE activities are generally one-time efforts that occur during the development phase, as opposed to recurring costs associated with ongoing production or maintenance. In industries such as semiconductor manufacturing or automotive engineering, NRE often covers costs related to tooling, prototyping, and initial validation of custom hardware or software solutions. 

The concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are unnecessarily high. However, focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field.

NRE-concepts-as-financial-investments are loss control tools considered part of manufacturing profit enhancement.

<text>Black is a small lunar impact crater that lies just to the southeast of the walled basin Kästner. To the south-southwest is the crater Ansgarius, and to the east is the small Dale. It is located near the eastern limb of the Moon, just to the southwest of the Mare Smythii.

Black is circular with a well-defined edge, and inner walls that slope down to a small interior floor. It is not notably marked by erosion or impacts. The northwest wall is separated from the rim of Kästner by less than one crater diameter. This crater was formerly designated Kästner F before it was named by the IAU.

<text>The Triumph Herald is a small two-door car introduced by Standard-Triumph of Coventry in 1959 and made through to 1971. The body design was by the Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti, and the car was offered in saloon, convertible, coupé, estate and van models, with the latter marketed as the Triumph Courier.

Total Herald sales numbered well over half a million. The Triumph Vitesse, Spitfire and GT6 models are all based on modified Herald chassis and running gear with bolt-together bodies.

==Herald &amp; Herald S (948 cc)==
Towards the end of the 1950s Standard-Triumph offered a range of two-seater Triumph sports cars alongside its Standard saloons, the Standard Eight and Standard Ten, powered by a small (803 cc or 948 cc) 4-cylinder engine, which by the late 1950s were due for an update. Standard-Triumph therefore started work on the Herald. The choice of the Herald name suggests that the car was originally intended to be marketed as a Standard, as it fits the model-naming scheme of the time (Ensign, Pennant and Standard itself). But by 1959 it was felt that the Triumph name had more brand equity, and the Standard name was phased out in Britain after 1963.

Giovanni Michelotti was commissioned to style the car by the Standard-Triumph board, encouraged by chief engineer Harry Webster, and quickly produced designs for a two-door saloon with a large glass area that gave 93 per cent all-round visibility in the saloon variant and the &quot;razor-edge&quot; looks to which many makers were turning. As Fisher &amp; Ludlow, Standard-Triumph&#x27;s body suppliers became part of an uncooperative British Motor Corporation, it was decided that the car should have a separate chassis rather than adopting the newer unitary construction. The main body tub was bolted to the chassis and the whole front end hinged forward to allow access to the engine. Every panel – including the sills and roof – could be unbolted from the car so that different body styles could be easily built on the same chassis. As an addition to the original coupé and saloon models, a convertible was introduced in 1960.

The Standard Pennant&#x27;s 4-cylinder 948 cc OHV Standard SC engine and 4 speed manual gearbox was used with synchromesh on the top three gears and remote gear shift and driving the rear wheels. Most of the engine parts were previously used in the Standard 8/10. The rack and pinion steering afforded the Herald a tight turning circle. At the front coil and double-wishbone front suspension was fitted which was in time directly copied by such as Lotus, the Bill Thomas Cheetah and Reliant. The rear suspension, in a new departure for Triumph, offered &quot;limited&quot; independent springing via a single transverse leaf-spring bolted to the top of the final drive unit and swing axles.

Instruments were confined to a single large speedometer with fuel gauge in the saloon (a temperature gauge was available as an option) on a dashboard of grey pressed fibreboard. The coupé dashboard was equipped with speedometer, fuel and temperature gauges, together with a lockable glovebox. The car had loop-pile carpeting and heater as standard. A number of extras were available including twin SU carburettors, leather seats, a wood-veneered dashboard, Telaflo shock absorbers and paint options.

In late 1958, prototype cars embarked on a test run from Cape Town to Tangiers. An account of the journey was embellished by PR at the time. However, only minor changes were deemed necessary between the prototype and production cars. The new car was launched at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 22 April 1959 but was not an immediate sales success, partly owing to its relatively high cost, approaching £700 (including 45 per cent Purchase Tax). In standard single-carburettor form the car was no better than average in terms of performance. A saloon tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1959 was found to have a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 31.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded.

The rear suspension was criticised as yielding poor handling at the extremes of performance though the model was considered easy to drive with its good vision, light steering (smallest turning circle of any production car) and controls, and ease of repair.

A Herald S variant was introduced in 1961 with a lower equipment level and less chrome than the Herald. It was offered in saloon form only.

The 948 cc Herald Coupé and Convertible models were discontinued in 1961, the 948 cc Herald Saloon in 1962 and the Herald S in 1964. 
== Herald 1200==
Standard-Triumph experienced financial difficulties at the beginning of the 1960s and was taken over by Leyland Motors in 1961. This released new resources to develop the Herald and the car was re-launched in April 1961 with an 1147 cc engine as the Herald 1200. The new model featured rubber-covered bumpers, a wooden laminate dashboard and improved seating. Quality control was also tightened up. Twin carburettors were no longer fitted to any of the range as standard although they remained an option, the standard being a single down-draught Solex carburettor. Claimed maximum power of the Herald 1200 was , as against the claimed for the 948 cc model. One month after the release of the Herald 1200, a 3-door estate was added to the range. Disc brakes became an option from 1962.

Sales picked up despite growing competition from the Mini and the Ford Anglia. The coupé was dropped from the range in late 1964 as it was by then in direct competition with the Triumph Spitfire. The Herald 1200 remained in production until 1970.

==Courier van==
The Triumph Courier van, a Herald estate with side panels in place of rear side windows, was produced from 1962 until 1966, but was dropped following poor sales. Production in England ceased in mid-1964. CKD assembly by MCA in Malta continued till late 1965, at least. The Courier was powered by the 1147 cc engine.


==Herald 12/50==
An upmarket version, the Herald 12/50, was offered from 1963 to 1967. It featured a tuned engine with a claimed output of in place of the previous 39, along with a sliding (Weathershield) vinyl-fabric sunroof and front disc brakes as standard. The 12/50, which was offered only as a 2-door saloon, was fitted with a fine-barred aluminium grille.

The power output of the 1200, which remained in production alongside the 12/50, was subsequently boosted to 48 bhp.
==Herald 13/60==
In October 1967 the range was updated with the introduction at the London Motor Show of the Herald 13/60. The 13/60 was offered in saloon, convertible and estate-bodied versions. The sun-roof remained available for the saloon as an optional extra rather than a standard feature. The front end was restyled using a bonnet similar to the Triumph Vitesse&#x27;s and the interior substantially revised though still featuring the wooden dashboard. Interior space was improved by recessing a rear armrest in each side panel. The engine was enlarged to 1296 cc, essentially the unit employed since 1965 in the Triumph 1300, fitted with a Stromberg CD150 carburettor, offering and much improved performance. In this form (though the 1200 saloon was sold alongside it until the end of 1970) the Herald Saloon lasted until December 1970 and the Convertible and Estate until May 1971, by which time, severely outdated in style if not performance, it had already outlived the introduction of the Triumph 1300 Saloon, the car designed to replace it and was still selling reasonably well but, because of its labour-intensive method of construction, selling at a loss.
==International production==
Triumph Heralds were exported and assembled in a number of countries, and the separate chassis used as a jig to assemble kits exported from Coventry. These cars were referred to as CKD – Complete Knock Down cars.

===India===

In the 1960s Standard Motor Products of Madras, India, manufactured Triumph Heralds with the basic 948 cc engine under the name Standard Herald, eventually with additional four-door saloon and five-door estate models exclusively for the Indian market. In 1971 they introduced a restyled four-door saloon based on the Herald called the Standard Gazel, using the same 948 cc engine but with the axle changed to that of the Toledo, as the Herald&#x27;s &quot;swing-arm&quot; was deemed unable to cope with road conditions in the Indian interior. The Gazel was discontinued in 1977.

===Australia===
The Herald was produced in Australia by Australian Motor Industries from 1959 to 1966 with output totalling 14,975 units. Production included a 12/50 model, which unlike its British namesake was offered in both saloon and coupé body styles. It featured the bonnet and four angled headlights of the Triumph Vitesse and was marketed as the Triumph 12/50, without Herald badges.

===Others===
Triumph Heralds were also assembled in South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, and at two locations in Peru. The Herald 1200 was also assembled in Italy, at Ducati&#x27;s Borgo Panigale motorcycle factory.

==In popular media==
A Triumph Herald was used at the 2012 London Olympic Games during the beginning of the closing ceremony when cars were paraded around the stadium. In the 1960s based TV drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, Dr Kate Rowan drove a cactus green Herald from series 1 until series 5. In the TV comedy series &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, Edie drove a red Herald convertible, restored by her husband Wesley. A Herald converted to a sailing boat appeared in 2006 (series 8, episode 3) and 2007 (series 10, episode 2) on TV series &quot;Top Gear&quot;. It was driven and sailed by presenter James May.
A white Herald 1360 convertible was driven by the actor Paul McGann in the 1990 film &quot;Paper Mask&quot;, when he played a hospital porter who decided to impersonate a doctor. There is an affectionate portrayal of a Triumph Herald Estate car in the novel &quot;Room for Us&quot; by Roger Harvey (2020, ). David Niven drove a beaten-up Herald convertible to escape from terrorists in the 1975 movie &quot;Paper Tiger&quot;. In the Luann comic strip, Mrs. DeGroot tells her children that she was first attracted to their father because he drove a blue Triumph Herald convertible. 

A blue Triumph Herald 13/60 Convertible was one of the main features of the film &quot;Soft Top Hard Shoulder&quot; written by and starring Peter Capaldi, co-starring his wife Elaine Collins and released in the UK in 1993.

==Herald-based cars==
The Equipe was a car produced by Bond, using the Triumph Herald chassis and components.

Having a separate body mounted to a chassis, the Triumph Herald provides a sound basis for a kit car. Examples include:
*Sussita 12 – (1968–1970) A car made in Israel, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company Ltd. The Susita 12 station wagon, and sedan (named Carmel), used the Triumph Herald 12/50 engine.
*Sussita 13/60 – (1970–1975) An Israeli made car, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company Ltd. Manufactured as 2 doors station wagon, sedan (named Carmel Ducas), and pick-up versions. Built on the Triumph Herald&#x27;s chassis, and used the Herald 13/60 engine and gearbox.
*The &quot;T car&quot; by New Zealand company Alternative Cars is a MGTF &quot;replica&quot;, which, although not an exact copy of the MGTF, has some of the spirit of the original. About 250 were made and they have a high survival rate. It has its body made of fibreglass with a steel bonnet. 
*Early versions of the Marlin used Herald components.
*Gentry Cars – again, loosely based on the MG TF.
*Spartan Cars – a traditional styled open 2 seater.
* Moss cars could be based on either Triumph or Ford components.

The German-designed and built amphibious Amphicar used the same 1147cc engine as the Herald, and though not designed by Michelotti, has a strong family resemblance.

==Scale models and die-cast==
*Meccano Dinky Toys; No. 189 (production 1959–1963), Herald 948 cc, approximately O scale (1/44). The Dinky Triumph Herald was the very first scale model introduced to coincide with an actual car launch.
*Corgi No. 231 (production 1961–1965), Herald Coupé 948 cc, approximately O scale (1/44).
*Airfix; 1/32 scale. Introduced in 1967 as a bagged kit.
* Hongwell available in 1/43 scale

<doc id="1165704" wikidata="Q1462742" url="?curid=1165704" title="Mark of Cornwall">
<text>Mark of Cornwall (, , , ) was a sixth-century King of Kernow (Cornwall), possibly identical with King Conomor. He is best known for his appearance in Arthurian legend as the uncle of Tristan and the husband of Iseult, who engages with Tristan in a secret liaison, giving Mark the epithet &quot;Cuckold King&quot;.

==King Mark==


In Old Welsh records, Mark is recorded as &quot;March son of Meirchion&quot; of Kernow (Cornwall). He is associated with governing portions of Gwynedd and Glamorgan in Wales. The distance of these areas from modern day Cornwall may indicate that Mark was in fact a ruler of the eponymous Cornovii. Mark has been identified with Conomor, a king of Domnonea and Kernev (Domnonée and Cornouaille) in Armorica.

In his &quot;Life of St. Pol de Leon&quot;, Wrmonoc of Landévennec refers to a &quot;King Marc whose other name is Quonomorus&quot;. Also rendered as &quot;Cunomorus&quot;, the name means &quot;Hound-of-the-sea&quot;.

An inscription on a sixth-century gravestone near the Cornish town of Fowey memorializes (in Latin) a &quot;Drustanus son of Cunomorus&quot;, and it has been thought that this is the &quot;Tristan son of Mark (alias &#x27;Quonomorus&#x27;)&quot; of legend. The present location of the stone is at , but it was originally at Castle Dore. It has a mid-6th-century, two-line inscription which has been interpreted as DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT CVNOWORI FILIVS (&quot;Drustan lies here, of Cunomorus the son&quot;). A now-missing third line was described by the 16th-century antiquarian John Leland as CVM DOMINA OUSILLA (&quot;with the lady Ousilla&quot;). Ousilla is a Latinisation of the Cornish female name Eselt. The stone led to Mark&#x27;s association with Castle Dore.

==Legend==
In most versions of the story of Tristan and Iseult, King Mark of Cornwall is Tristan&#x27;s uncle. His sister is Tristan&#x27;s mother, Blancheflor (also known as Elizabeth or Isabelle). In some later versions he is related to Tristan&#x27;s father, Meliadus.

Mark sends Tristan as his proxy to bring his young bride, Princess Iseult, from Ireland. Tristan and Iseult fall in love and, with the help of a magic potion, have one of the stormiest love affairs in medieval literature. Mark suspects the affair, and his suspicions are eventually confirmed. In some versions he sends for Tristan to be hanged, and banishes Iseult to a leper colony. Tristan escapes the hanging, and rescues Iseult from her confinement. Mark later discovers this, and eventually forgives them; Iseult returns to Mark, and Tristan leaves the country. The story is cyclical, with Mark repeatedly suspecting Tristan and Iseult of adultery and then believing that they are innocent. In Béroul&#x27;s version, Tristan and Iseult are never in grave danger; the narrator declares that he and God are on their side. Mark, as a husband and king, is not idealized like other Arthurian kings; his ties to the story are personal.

Marie de France&#x27;s Breton lai &quot;Chevrefoil&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;The Lay of the Honeysuckle&quot;) tells part of the Tristan and Iseult tale. The lai begins with an explanation of Mark&#x27;s fury at the affair of Tristan and Isoude, which leads Mark to banish Tristan from Cornwall. Tristan spends a year pining for Isoude in South Wales until his sorrow drives him to secretly return to Cornwall. Hiding in the woods and sheltering with villagers at night, Tristan hears that Mark plans to hold a Pentecost feast with Isoude. Tristan knows that the queen will ride through the forest to get there. He determines her most-likely path, and places on the trail a stripped hazel stick with a carving of his name on it. Isoude recognizes the sign and, stopping her party to rest, she and her maid Brangwaine leave to find Tristan. During the illicit meeting, Isoude helps Tristan with a plan to win back Mark&#x27;s favor. Marie ends the poem with a revelation that the &quot;lai&quot; Tristan composed was called &quot;Goatleaf&quot; in English (&quot;Chèvrefeuille&quot; in French), and the &quot;lai&quot; he composed was the one the reader just finished.

In the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, Mark is the son of king Felix and his character deteriorates from a sympathetic cuckold to a villain; he rapes his niece and murders her when she produces his son, Meraugis. Mark also murders his brother, Prince Boudwin, and later kills Boudwin&#x27;s vengeful teenage son Alisander (Alisuander, Alexander) the Orphan. In earlier variants of the story, Tristan dies in Brittany far from Mark; in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, however, Tristan is mortally wounded by Mark while he plays the harp under a tree for Iseult. This version of Mark was popular in other medieval works, including the &quot;Romance of Palamedes&quot; and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In these texts, Mark usually rules Cornwall from Tintagel Castle, is often an enemy of Arthur&#x27;s jester knight Dinadan, and (as in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, which ends with the death of Mark) even destroys Camelot after the death of Arthur. Malory&#x27;s version says that Alisander&#x27;s son eventually avenges his father and grandfather, presumably by killing Mark.

===Horse ears===
Mark has become associated with a Celtic variant of the story of Midas and his donkey ears from Greek mythology, due to a pun on &quot;marc&quot; (a Celtic word for &quot;horse&quot;). The story occurs in &quot;Tristan&quot; by the 12th-century French poet Béroul, where a dwarf reveals that &quot;Mark has horse&#x27;s ears&quot; to a hawthorn tree in the presence of three lords.

According to a Breton tale published in 1794, Mark was initially the king of Cornouaille, France, and was seated at Ploumarch (Portzmarch). The king kills every barber who knows the secret about his ears except one, who tells the secret to the sand (or wind). Reeds grow from that spot, which are harvested to make reeds for the oboe (or, simply, pipes). When the instruments are played, the music seems to say that the king has horse&#x27;s ears. John Rhys recorded a Welsh tale similar to the simpler Breton version.

An embellished 1905 version, collected by Yann ar Floc&#x27;h, blends the legend of Ys with the premise that Mark was condemned by Gradlon&#x27;s daughter (or Dahut). Mark tried to hunt her when she assumed the guise of a doe, and had his ears exchanged for those of his prized horse Morvarc&#x27;h.

==Modern culture==
*King Mark has a gruesome role in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poetry cycle &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. While Arthur and many of his knights are taking on the court of the Red Knight, Lancelot is called upon to judge &quot;The Tournament of the Dead Innocence.&quot; The tournament quickly becomes a mockery, full of insults and broken rules. Tristram (Tristan) is the winner of the tournament, winning all the rubies from the necklace. He then breaks with tradition in presenting them to a woman, saying: &quot;This day my Queen of Beauty is not here&quot;. This enrages the crowd, and many say that &quot;All courtesy is dead,&quot; and &quot;The glory of our Round Table is no more.&quot; Tristram, who in this version marries Isolt of the White Hands, carries his winnings to Mark&#x27;s wife Queen Isolt (who is upset that Tristram married another woman). They mock each other briefly before Tristram puts the necklace around Isolt&#x27;s neck and leans down to kiss her. Mark appears as his lips touch her, killing Tristram with a sword.
*Mark (the German &quot;Marke&quot;) is a character in Wagner&#x27;s 1859 opera, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, where the role was first sung by the bass Ludwig Zottmayer.
*In the 1954 film &quot;The Black Knight&quot;, he is depicted by Patrick Troughton as a pagan trying to overthrow Christianity and King Arthur.
*In the 1970s TV show &quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot;, Mark was played by Brian Blessed.
*In 1981 film &quot;Lovespell&quot;, King Mark was played by Richard Burton.
*Mark (called &quot;Marc&#x27;h of Kernow&quot;) is a character in Diana L. Paxson&#x27;s 1988 novel, &quot;The White Raven&quot;. The novel is of Paxson&#x27;s take on the Tristan and Iseult story from the point of view of Iseult&#x27;s cousin, Branwen.
*In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Enemy of God&quot; (part of his &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; series), King Mark is a physically- and morally-monstrous tyrant who murders his young wife every few years to marry another. When Mark&#x27;s newest teenage wife (Iseult) flees with his young son Tristan, the fugitive lovers take refuge in Mordred&#x27;s kingdom of Dumnonia under the regency of Tristan&#x27;s friend, Arthur. Arthur allows Mark to arrive with his soldiers, and has the prince killed and the queen burned at the stake. Mark later dies from a horrible illness.
*In the 2006 film &quot;Tristan &amp; Isolde&quot;, Marke was played by Rufus Sewell. He adopts Tristan as his son after the death of the boy&#x27;s parents, who loyally supported Marke&#x27;s plans to unite Britain. Marke is portrayed as a good ruler and a kind husband to Isolde (unaware that she has already fallen for Tristan), and is confused by his adopted son&#x27;s unhappy, distanced behaviour. When Tristan and Isolde are caught embracing, Marke feels angry and betrayed; he relents after hearing the story of their meeting and lets them leave together, although Tristan insists on staying to stand against Marke&#x27;s enemies. After Tristan is mortally wounded in battle, Marke returns him to Isolde for his last moments and then unites Britain.

<text>Bhabha is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s far side. It is nearly attached to the southeast rim of the larger crater Bose, and the outer of that crater has produced a slight inward bulge along the northwest face of Bhabha. Other nearby craters of note include Stoney to the east, and Bellinsgauzen to the south.

This is a relatively fresh crater with a nicely d inner wall. This terracing is most notable along the southeastern half of the crater, and nearly disappears along the north-northwest rim where the inner wall is at its minimum extent. The rim and inner wall have not been significantly eroded, and there are no craterlets of note along the rim.

The interior floor has a formation of central peaks that forms a semicircle with the concave interior open to the north. The remainder of the floor is relatively level, with a single small craterlet in the northern part.

Bhabha was named in honor of the physicist Homi Jehangir Bhabha (1909-1966), a nuclear physics pioneer in his home country of India.

<text>Welsh Newton is a small village and civil parish in the county of Herefordshire, England. It is located close to the border with Wales to which the parish extends towards Monmouthshire. It should not be confused with Newton, a township-chapelry in Clodock Parish and near Longtown, or with Newton Leominister. Its postal address is in Wales, with Monmouth as its post town.

==History==
The parish of Welsh Newton (which is grouped with the parish of Llanrothal to form Welsh Newton and Llanrothal Group Parish Council) contains two churches: a derelict Methodist chapel and the church of St Mary the Virgin which is also CoE and of Norman architecture, at Welsh Newton (containing an original rood screen). Catholic martyr St John Kemble, executed in 1679, is buried in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard. There is another Anglican church at Llanrothal.

The area contains a lot of history, including Pembridge Castle and at least thirty-one other archaeological sites in Welsh Newton parish alone. The parish also contains a piece of common land, currently registered as unowned under the Commons Act 2006, at Welsh Newton Common; a hill (and hamlet) overlooking the Wye Valley. The village is said to be haunted by several restless spirits, including the headless coachman who has been seen many times on the lane from St Wulstan&#x27;s Farm to the village. In the first week of December each year, several locals hold a ceremony to still the spirits. This takes place in the ruins of St Faith&#x27;s Church.

According to &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directory of Herefordshire 1929&quot;: 
:&quot;Welsh Newton is a Parish on the Hereford and Monmouth road, three and a half miles north from Monmouth and 8 south west from Ross, in the Southern Division of the county, Wormelow Hundred, Monmouth union and county court district, Harewood End Petty Sessional division, rural deanery of Archenfield and archdeaconry and diocese of Hereford. The Parish extends into Monmouthshire. The church of St. Mary is a plain but ancient building of stone in the Norman style, consisting of chancel, nave, south porch and a small western tower containing 2 bells: the screen is 12th century, lit by a 14th-century dormer window: the roof is 14th century; the stained east window was presented by Mrs. Marriot, in 1879, and there are memorial windows to Mrs. Tylor, of Callow Hill, who died in 1881. The register of baptisms dates from the year 1798; marriages, 1758; burials, 1800. The living is a vicarage, with the rectory of Llanrothal annexed in 1927...in the gift of the Bishop of Hereford. There is a Primitive Methodist Chapel on Welsh Newton Common. Pembridge Castle, built prior to the 13th century, is now a farmhouse. This historic castle was purchased by Dr. Hedley Bartlet (known as Mar Hedley, a Syro-Chaldean bishop), and partially restored in 1914; It was the home for many years of the priest and martyr Father John Kemble (d. 1679), whose tomb pilgrims visit in the village churchyard; his hand is preserved in a shrine at Hereford. The soil is loamy; subsoil, clay and rock. The chief crops are wheat, barley, oats, turnips and fruit. The area is 1,943 acres (7.9 km²).&quot;

(1) Cf Wikipedia: Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844

==Folklore==

In 1913, the historian John Hobson Matthews noted, “The bells of Welsh Newton, Herefordshire, are supposed to say: - &quot;Erfin, cawl erfin&quot; - turnips, turnip broth. This is taken to refer to the bareness of that parish “.

== Welsh Newton Common ==
The settlement of Welsh Newton Common within the parish is scattered across an area of registered common land with no known owner. The last attempt to establish ownership was made by Margaret Eldrudd De L&#x27;Isle in 1976, the then owner of the Glanusk Estate. Following a hearing before the Commons Commissioners the application was refused and the common remains unowned. In the absence of an owner, Herefordshire Council manages but does not own the common, nor can it grant rights over it (for example, rights of way) as an owner might. Under section 45 of the Commons Act 2006 the council has the power to

(a) take any steps to protect the land against unlawful interference that could be taken by an owner in possession of the land; and

(b) institute proceedings against any person for any offence committed in respect of the land.

== Notable buildings ==
Pembridge House is an 18th-century listed former Parsonage house situated in a central position within the village. Tremaide Farmhouse and its range of traditional farm buildings overlook the village to the east of the A466. Parkside Farm to the west of the village is a traditional stone farmhouse.

<doc id="1165709" wikidata="Q708172" url="?curid=1165709" title="Nipsey Russell">
<text>Julius &quot;Nipsey&quot; Russell (September 15, 1918 – October 2, 2005) was an American entertainer best known for his appearances as a panelist on game shows from the 1960s through the 1990s, including &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, and &quot;Pyramid&quot;. His appearances were often distinguished by short, humorous poems he recited during the broadcast, which led to his nickname &quot;the poet laureate of television&quot;. He had one of the leading roles in the film version of &quot;The Wiz&quot; as the Tin Man. He was a frequent guest on the &quot;Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; series and often appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; during the program&#x27;s early years.

==Early life==
Julius Russell was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His birthdate is unclear; according to one report his birth certificate was lost. At the time of his 2005 death, friends said he was 80, and that was the age reported in his obituaries. That implies a birth year of 1924 or 1925; the &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary gave his birthdate as October 13, 1924. Federal records suggest that he was born in 1918: Census documents record a Julius Russell in Atlanta aged 1 year 4 months in 1920, consistent with a birthdate in late 1918. The Social Security Death Index lists his birthdate as September 15, 1918.

He acquired the nickname &quot;Nipsey&quot; from his mother, who liked the way it sounded.

He went to Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta, then moved to Cincinnati to live with an aunt during his senior year so that he could establish residency to attend the University of Cincinnati tuition-free. He attended the University of Cincinnati for one semester in 1936, which is also consistent with a birthdate of 1918, as he would have been 18 and not merely 11 or 12, as he would have been if he had been born in 1924 or 1925. He served as a medic in the United States Army during World War II, enlisting as a private on June 27, 1941, and returning from Europe in 1945 as a second lieutenant.

He got his start as a comedian in the 1940s as a carhop at the Atlanta drive-in The Varsity, where he increased the tips he earned by making customers laugh. He was discovered after he began performing in nightclubs in the 1950s. He subsequently made many &quot;party albums&quot;, which were essentially compilations of his stand-up routines.

==Early career==
In 1952, Russell joined with film comedian Mantan Moreland for a stage act, replacing Ben Carter as Moreland&#x27;s dapper straight man. One of their bits was an old routine that Moreland and Carter had performed in vaudeville and in Charlie Chan films. In the &quot;interruption routine&quot; (or &quot;incomplete sentences&quot;) Moreland would engage Russell in conversation, only to be interrupted by Russell, who in turn was interrupted by Moreland:

&lt;poem&gt;Moreland: Guess who I saw? I saw old—
Russell: Is he back again? I thought he was—
Moreland: He was, but he got out.
Russell: Is that so?
Moreland: Yeah, he was over—
Russell: Is &quot;that&quot; so?&lt;/poem&gt;

Soon the entire conversation was conducted in incomplete sentences, with each man anticipating or contradicting the other. Their act can be seen in two all-black-cast compilation films, &quot;Rhythm and Blues Review&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Revue&quot;; another variation of the &quot;interruption routine&quot;, performed by Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover, was featured in Spike Lee&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Bamboozled&quot;.

A September 1957 appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; led to several guest spots with Jack Paar on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and in 1961 a supporting role as a New York policeman, &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, in the sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; Russell returned to the role in the feature film version of &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (filmed in 1990, released in 1994), with &quot;Anderson&quot; now serving as the precinct captain.

In 1965, Russell became a co-host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Les Crane Show&quot;. In 1970, he was a co-star on the ABC sitcom &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. From 1973 through 1976, he appeared regularly on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Comedy World&quot;. In 1978, he played the Tin Man in the film version of &quot;The Wiz&quot; alongside Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. Scattered appearances on television series followed, as well as occasional guest-host stints on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the Johnny Carson era. Russell also appeared frequently in Las Vegas, including a series of appearances with Sergio Franchi at the Frontier Hotel in 1978 and 1979, and with Franchi in 1979 at the Sands Hotel Copa Room. He performed at Kutsher&#x27;s Country Club in Monticello, New York, on January 1, 1977.

==Game shows==
Russell became the first black performer to become a regular panelist on a daily network game show when he joined ABC&#x27;s &quot;Missing Links&quot; in 1964. In 1971, he started as a featured panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, which led to his being hired for &quot;The Match Game&quot; when Goodson-Todman Productions revived it two years later. He also served as panelist in 1968 on the syndicated version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; Producer Bob Stewart featured him regularly as a panelist on &quot;Pyramid&quot; throughout its 1970s and 1980s runs. He hosted two revivals of Jack Barry and Dan Enright&#x27;s &quot;Juvenile Jury&quot; for BET from 1983 to 1984, then again for syndication from 1989 to 1991. In 1983, Russell hosted a pilot game show on CBS called &quot;Star Words&quot;. Three pilots were recorded in June of that year but the show was not picked up. In 1985, he hosted the short-lived NBC game show &quot;Your Number&#x27;s Up&quot;, which was produced by Sande Stewart.

Russell’s specialty on game shows was delivering short, humorous poems. He was a regular panelist on a 1970s ABC show, &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot;, built around his poetic talents. In 1979, he told &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, “I knew two poems and one day, on a show called &quot;Missing Links&quot; (Ed McMahon was the host), I did one poem and everybody applauded. The next day I did the other one I knew. On the third morning, Ed said, ‘And now Nipsey’s poem.’ I didn’t really know any more poems, but I realized that this was a winning gimmick – that people liked this. So I went home to see if I could create them and found that I could. And that’s how I started. I actually stumbled into it on the air.”

==Later career and death==
During the 1990s, Russell gained popularity with a new generation of television viewers as a regular on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Russell often appeared during comedy sketches between scheduled guests and delivered his trademark rhymes.

Russell&#x27;s final TV appearance was as a panelist on a game show–themed week on the final season of the Tom Bergeron version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 2003.

Russell died on October 2, 2005, at age 87 in New York City&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital, of cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.

<text>Charles Louis Busch (born August 23, 1954) is an American actor, screenwriter, playwright and drag queen, known for his appearances on stage in his own camp style plays and in film and television. He wrote and starred in his early plays off-off-Broadway beginning in 1978, generally in drag roles, and also acted in the works of other playwrights. He also wrote for television and began to act in films and on television in the late 1990s. His best known play is &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2000), which was a success on Broadway.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Busch was born in 1954 and grew up in Hartsdale, New York. He is the Jewish son of Gertrude (née Young) and Benjamin Busch. His father, who wanted to be an opera singer, owned a record store. His mother died when Busch was seven. He has two older sisters: Meg Busch, who used to be a producer of promotional spots for Showtime, and Betsy Busch, a textile designer. Busch&#x27;s aunt, Lillian Blum, his mother&#x27;s oldest sister and a former teacher, brought him to live in Manhattan after the death of his mother. Busch was intensely interested in films as a young child, especially those with female leads from the 30s and 40s.

Busch attended The High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. He majored in drama at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and received his B.A. in 1976. While at the university, Busch had difficulty being cast in plays and began to write his own material, which succeeded in drawing interest on campus.

===Early theatre years===

In his plays, Busch usually played the leading lady in drag. He has said, &quot;Drag is being more, more than you can be. When I first started drag I wasn&#x27;t this shy young man but a powerful woman. It liberated within me a whole vocabulary of expression. It was less a political statement than an aesthetic one.&quot; His camp style shows simultaneously send up and celebrate classic film genres.

Busch has said, however, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what [campy] means, but I guess if my plays have elements of old movies and old fashioned plays, and I&#x27;m this bigger-than-life star lady, that&#x27;s certainly campy. I guess what I rebelled against was the notion that campy means something is so tacky or bad that it&#x27;s good, and that I just didn&#x27;t relate to.&quot; Busch toured the country in a non-drag one-man show he wrote called &quot;Alone With a Cast of Thousands&quot; from 1978 to 1984.

By 1984, Busch&#x27;s performance bookings grew slim. He held various odd jobs, such as temporary office assistant, apartment cleaner, portrait artist &quot;at bar mitzvahs&quot;, phone salesperson, shop manager, ice cream server, sports handicapper and artists&#x27; model.

He thought perhaps that this last piece would be a skit put on in the Limbo Lounge, a performance space and gallery in the East Village in Manhattan. The skit was a hit and became &quot;Vampire Lesbians of Sodom&quot; (1984).

Busch and his collaborators soon created a series of shows, mostly at the Limbo Lounge, such as &quot;Theodora, She-Bitch of Byzantium&quot; (1984) and &quot;Times Square Angel&quot; (1985, Provincetown Playhouse). The company called itself &quot;Theatre in Limbo&quot; and attracted a loyal gay following. Other early plays include &quot;Pardon My Inquisition, or Kiss the Blood Off My Castanets&quot; (1986), in which Busch played both Maria Garbanza, a prostitute, and her look-alike, the elegant Marquesa del Drago. and &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot;, which ran from July 1987 to May 1988. Other works include &quot;The Lady in Question&quot;, which ran from July to December 1989 at the Orpheum Theatre, and &quot;Red Scare on Sunset&quot;, which ran from June to September 1991 at the Lortel Theatre.

Busch rewrote the book for the musical &quot;Ankles Aweigh&quot; for a 1988 production staged by the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut.

His &quot;Charles Busch Revue&quot; was produced at the Ballroom Theatre in May 1993 in New York. Also in 1993, he performed in a revival of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; at the Off-Broadway Classic Stage Company in the role of Solange.

In 1993, he wrote a novel, &quot;Whores of Lost Atlantis&quot;, a fictionalized re-telling of the creation of &quot;Vampire Lesbians of Sodom&quot;. &quot;The Green Heart&quot; was adapted by Busch from a short story by Jack Ritchie into a musical which was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club at the Variety Arts Theatre in New York City, opening in April 1997.

He took the male lead in his comedy, &quot;You Should Be So Lucky&quot; which opened at Primary Stages Company, New York City, in November 1994.

Other works of the 1990s include &quot;Swingtime Canteen&quot;, produced at the Blue Angel, New York City, in August 1995. His one-man show, &quot;Flipping My Wig&quot; ran at the WPA Theater, New York City, starting in December 1996.

He wrote &quot;Queen Amarantha&quot;, which played at the WPA Theatre, starting in October 1997. His play &quot;Die, Mommie, Die!&quot; was first performed in Los Angeles, opening in July 1999 at the Coast Playhouse.

===Film and television===
Busch&#x27;s early film appearances include Ms. Ellen, a fortune teller in drag in &quot;Trouble on the Corner&quot; (1997). Busch has twice appeared in film versions of his own plays: &quot;Die, Mommie, Die!&quot; (1999) and the comedy horror &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot; (2000). He co-wrote, starred in and directed the film &quot;A Very Serious Person&quot; (2006), which starred Polly Bergen and received an honorable mention at the Tribeca Film Festival. In 2020, Busch co-wrote, co-directed, and starred in the film, &quot;The Sixth Reel&quot; (2021).

Busch had a recurring role in the HBO series &quot;Oz&quot; from 1999 to 2000 (the third and fourth seasons) as Nat Ginzburg, an &quot;effeminate but makeup-free inmate on death row, certainly a departure from his usual glamour girl roles.&quot; He wrote television sitcom pilots and movie treatments as a source of extra income while he was a cult performer. He sold three pilots to CBS that were not produced. In 2001, he guest starred on the American soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, playing Peg Barlow, a woman who owns a modeling agency. Nowhere in the show was it referenced that a male actor was portraying a woman.

===Stage work, 2000–present===
Busch&#x27;s work debuted on Broadway in October 2000, when &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; opened, following an Off-Broadway run in February through April 2000. The play, his first in which he did not star, and the first created for a mainstream audience, was written for actress Linda Lavin, who played opposite Michele Lee and Tony Roberts. &quot;Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; received a 2001 nomination for Tony Award for Best Play and ran for 777 performances. His other Broadway work was rewriting the book for Boy George&#x27;s short-lived autobiographical musical &quot;Taboo&quot;. Since 2000, Busch has performed an annual one-night staged reading of his 1984 Christmas play &quot;Times Square Angel&quot;. In January 2003, he headlined a revival of his 1999 play &quot;Shanghai Moon&quot;, costarring BD Wong, at the Drama Dept, Greenwich House Theatre, New York City.

He has taken the eponymous lead in three productions of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;: a staged reading in 1998; a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS in 2003; and a small-scale summer touring production in 2004.

&quot;Our Leading Lady&quot;, Busch&#x27;s play about Laura Keene, was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club at the City Center Stage II Theatre, in 2007, and starred Kate Mulgrew. His play, &quot;The Third Story&quot;, premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in September 2008 with Mary Beth Peil as Peg, and was then produced in New York by MCC Theater at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, starring Busch and Kathleen Turner (Peg), opening in February 2009. Busch wrote and starred in a play, &quot;The Divine Sister&quot;, a satirical take on Hollywood films about religion, including &quot;Doubt&quot; and the &quot;Sound of Music&quot;. It ran at the SoHo Playhouse in New York City, opening in September 2010. In 2013, Busch wrote and starred as Jimmy in the Primary Stages production of &quot;The Tribute Artist&quot;. In March 2019, Busch starred as Lucille Ball in &quot;I Loved Lucy&quot; by playwright Lee Tannen at the Bridge Street Theatre in Catskill, New York.

==Performance style and influences==
Busch&#x27;s style is based on movie star acting rather than naturalistic femininity. Busch later said that he was described as &quot;too thin, too light, which is the euphemism for gay. I was never cast at Northwestern for basically these reasons, and finally, I thought maybe what&#x27;s most disturbing about me is what is most unique: my theatrical sense, my androgyny, even identifying with old movie actresses&quot;. He specializes in femmes fatales. &quot;I&#x27;m an actor playing a role, but it&#x27;s drag. A lot of drag can be very offensive, but I like to think that in some crazy way the women I play are feminist heroines.&quot;

Busch said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always played a duality. I guess I&#x27;ve always felt a duality in myself: elegance and vulgarity. There&#x27;s humor in that. I&#x27;ve always found that fun on stage, as well. It&#x27;s not enough for me to be the whore. I have to be the whore with pretensions or the great lady with a vulgar streak. It&#x27;s the duality that I find interesting.&quot; Busch generally writes without a political agenda, and he predominantly portrays characters who are white, middle class, gay, and between 20 and 40 years old. Even though Busch worked in a time when gay individuals were viewed and treated differently than straight individuals, straight audiences still enjoyed his work because of his &quot;ability to entertain without creating a members-only atmosphere&quot; (42). 

Busch was inspired by Charles Ludlam, an avant-garde performer and playwright who founded The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967 and wrote, directed, and acted in the company&#x27;s exaggerated, absurdist camp productions. Busch presented his one-man show &quot;Hollywood Confidential&quot; in a theater owned by The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in July 1978 at One Sheridan Square, New York. He also appeared for several performances in the company&#x27;s production of &quot;Bluebeard&quot; as Hecate, also in July 1978. Busch said of this experience: &quot;If I had ever entertained a fantasy of working with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, doing Hecate got it out of my system.&quot; Busch has said that he was also inspired by seeing Joan Sutherland and Zoe Caldwell perform when he was a child. Busch recalled: &quot;When I was about 13 years old, around 1968 or &#x27;69, I went to see Zoe Caldwell in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.&quot; I was so dazzled that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever recovered.&quot; In 1991, Busch was performing in his play &quot;Red Scare on Sunset&quot;. He said that he had difficulty connecting with the audience at one of the performances. Caldwell went backstage after the performance to give him some advice: &quot;&#x27;You are so beautiful. But you were pushing too hard. You&#x27;re much better than that.&#x27; ...It&#x27;s the best lesson I&#x27;ve learned from a famous person.&quot; During his run in &quot;The Tribute Artist&quot;, Busch revealed that he also found inspiration in drag performers Charles Pierce and Lynne Carter.

==Memoir==
Busch released his memoir, &quot;Leading Lady: A Memoir of a Most Unusual Boy&quot;, in September 2023. In March 2024 it was shortlisted for the 2024 Lambda Literary Award for Gay Memoir or Biography.

==Awards and nominations==
Busch received the Charlie Local and National Comedy Award from the Association of Comedy Artists in 1985 for &quot;special contributions to the art of comedy.&quot; He also received the Manhattan Academy of Cabaret Award in 1985 and 1993.

In 2003, he won the Best Performance Award at the Sundance Film Festival for his performance in the film &quot;Die Mommie Die!&quot;

He has been honored with a star on the Playwright&#x27;s Walk of Fame outside the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York City and the Legend Award by the Off-Broadway League of Theatres. He was awarded the Gingold Theatrical Group Golden Shamrock award in 2014.

Busch is included in the book &quot;50 Key Figures in Queer US Theatre&quot; (2022), with a chapter written by theatre scholar Sean F. Edgecomb. Busch was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame in 2024.

<text>Berosus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon, less than one crater diameter northwest of Hahn. Further to the east-northeast is the large crater Gauss, and to the north-northwest lies Bernoulli. Because of its location, this crater appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth.

The rim of this crater is roughly circular, but with some angularity along the eastern edge. The southern end of the crater has been heavily eroded, and there are some tiny craterlets along the northern rim. The inner walls have some along the east and northwestern sides. The interior floor of Berosus has been flooded by lava, and so is level and nearly featureless.

Berosus is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berosus.

<doc id="1165723" wikidata="Q5633939" url="?curid=1165723" title="HMS Queen Emma">
<text>HMS &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was a commando troop ship of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Built as a civilian passenger liner in 1939 by De Schelde at Vlissingen, she was named the MS &quot;Koningin Emma&quot;, after Queen Emma of the Netherlands, and operated by Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ) (The Zealand Steamship Company) between Flushing and Harwich, along with her sister ship, MS &quot;Prinses Beatrix&quot;. After fleeing to Britain after the German invasion in 1940, she was requisitioned by the British Ministry of War Transport, renamed HMS &quot;Queen Emma&quot; and converted to a troopship at Harland and Wolff&#x27;s yard in Belfast. During the war her main role was transporting British Commandos, and she participated in the Lofoten Islands Raid and the Dieppe Raid. She had the advantage of a high speed that allowed hit and run operations. Later designated as a Landing Ship, Infantry (Medium) she took part in the landings in North Africa, Sicily and Normandy. She operated in the Indian Ocean, and in the Dutch East Indies after the end of the war. In 1946 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was returned to her owners and continued to operate as ferry from the Hook of Holland until 1969, when she was scrapped in Antwerp, Belgium.

==Construction==
The MS &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; was ordered by the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ) in December 1937 to operate between Vlissingen (Flushing) and Harwich. The keel was laid on 7 May 1938 at the De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, and the ship was launched on 14 January 1939 by Queen Wilhelmina. However the &quot;Emma&quot; stuck on the slipway and it took more than four hours to free her.

During sea trials &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; made more than which was more than was contractually agreed. On 19 May 1939 the ship was handed over to the SMZ. It had a gross tonnage of 4,135 tons and was capable of carrying 1,800 passengers. Propulsion was provided by two 2-stroke Sulzer diesel engines with a total output of 12,500 shp.

==Service history==
&quot;Koningin Emma&quot; entered service on 4 June 1939, but after the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, was withdrawn, and remained in port. On 10 May 1940 the Germans launched their invasion of the Netherlands, dropping mines in the Schelde estuary, and bombing and strafing shipping. &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; promptly fled, arriving at London on 15 May.

===Troop transport===
Two days later the British Ministry of War Transport chartered her as a troop transport. She was fitted with &quot;degaussing&quot; coils as protection against German magnetic mines and sailed with her original civilian crew on board in addition to a Dutch Marine detachment.

The ship was ordered to take French troops evacuated to England from Dunkirk back to Brest to continue the fight. She left Plymouth on 2 June and sailed with 1,712 aboard, accompanied by the French corvette &quot;Commandant Rivière&quot;. They returned the next day, then sailed once more with approximately 1,500 men on board, returning with British troops. On 16 June &quot;Koningin Emma&quot;, made her last voyage to Brest. By now the Germans had occupied most of northern France, so she was ordered to Bayonne on 20 June where 1,482 evacuees were boarded.

&quot;Koningin Emma&quot; then took part in the British occupation of Iceland, landing troops and equipment. In September 1940 &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; was formally taken over by the Admiralty to be converted into an &quot;assault ship&quot; at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The upper deck was largely cleared and gravity davits installed enabling six LCAs and two LCM(1)s to be carried, along with 450 troops. &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; was armed with two 12-pounder guns, two 2-pounders, four Hotchkiss 20 mm machine guns, and four .303 cal. machine guns. The ship was commissioned as HMS &quot;Queen Emma&quot; on 22 January 1941 as a special service ship.

===Lofoten Raid===
Her first major action in her new role was Operation Claymore, a raid on the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway. On 22 February 1941 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; arrived at Scapa Flow, where men of 4 Commando boarded, as well as Royal Engineer demolition experts and a contingent of Norwegian troops. The British ships – five destroyers and two troop ships – entered the Vestfjord on the morning of 4 March, and launched their attack. Surprise was complete and there was little resistance. All targets selected were located and destroyed. The troops were embarked by 13.00 hours and within half an hour the British had left. After returning to England &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was used for the training and exercise of Special Forces in Scotland.

===South Atlantic===
In late 1941 she was selected to join the forces gathered at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for Operation Pilgrim, the planned occupation of the Canary Islands, if either the Spanish or the Germans captured Gibraltar. After maintenance at Glasgow &quot;Queen Emma&quot; sailed to Freetown, arriving on 5 October 1941. However, it soon became clear that Franco did not plan to join the Axis, nor was he prepared to allow the German troops free passage through Spain to attack Gibraltar, and the operation was cancelled.

On 4 November 1941 the British navy tanker reported that she had been attacked by a German raider, between Natal, Brazil and Freetown. &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was one of the ships sent to search. No German raider was found and the Admiralty assumed that a German U-boat had shot at the tanker. However, on 22 November the was sunk by the British cruiser in the southern Atlantic close to Ascension Island, and on 1 December the cruiser sank the German supply ship &quot;Python&quot; in the same area. Almost all the crews from both ships were taken aboard German and Italian submarines. The British feared that the Germans would try to land on Ascension and overwhelm the tiny garrison. &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was hurriedly loaded with troops and set sail. However, while en route it was learned that the German crewmen were on their way to Bordeaux and the ship was recalled.

On 14 February 1942 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; left Freetown, and returned to England for refitting, after which she was reclassified as a Landing Ship, Infantry (Medium).

===Dieppe Raid===
In April 1942 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was selected to take part in a raid on the French coast at Dieppe. On the evening of 18 August 1942 a fleet of more than 200 ships sailed across the Channel. &quot;Queen Emma&quot; and the former Belgian ship &quot;Princess Astrid&quot; landed men of the Royal Regiment of Canada on &quot;Blue Beach&quot; to the east of Dieppe at Puys. However, the raid was not a success, and the losses were high.

===Invasion of North Africa===
&quot;Queen Emma&quot; was then assigned to Training Squadron D based on the Clyde, carrying out exercises with Special Forces and practising the landing of ground troops on enemy beaches. All these exercises were in preparation for the landings in North Africa, Operation Torch. On 26 October 1942 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; received troops from the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, then joined Convoy KMF-1 for North Africa, landing her troops west of Oran.

===The Moonlight Squadron===
&quot;Queen Emma&quot; remained in the western Mediterranean, supplying and transporting reinforcements for the First Army. On the evening of Friday, 13 November 1942, &quot;Queen Emma&quot; left Algiers with units of the British 78th Infantry Division for Bône, close to the front line. On the return trip to Algiers she was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft, but made port without damage.

&quot;Queen Emma&quot;, her sister ship &quot;Princess Beatrix&quot;, and the former Burn &amp; Laird Lines ships and became known as the &quot;Moonlight Squadron&quot; for their preference for operating at night. After the fall of Tunis in May 1943 the ships received a special commendation from the Allied Army Commanders and a letter from the British Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the commander in chief of the western Mediterranean.

===Invasion of Sicily===
&quot;Queen Emma&quot; was then attached to the ships of Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The British sector was greatly hampered by severe German air attacks, and on 17 July 1943 the &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was hit, with 18 killed and 70 wounded. The ship sailed to Malta for repairs. Her speed had been reduced to , so she was downgraded to troop transport vessel. After the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943 she escorted units of the Italian fleet to Malta, and soon afterwards sailed back to England for a complete overhaul.

===Invasion of France===
&quot;Queen Emma&quot; then began landing exercises in preparation for Operation Overlord, the invasion of France. On 6 June 1944 &quot;Queen Emma&quot; sailed with Canadian troops to Normandy. The ship was part of the transport group of the Eastern Naval Task Force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Chandler. In the weeks after D-Day &quot;Queen Emma&quot; completed numerous voyages between England and the French coast, carrying men of the U.S. 8th Air Force, and a number of British Guards Divisions, as well as units of the English ATS and Wrens, despite the danger of German coastal batteries, E-boats and midget submarines.

At the end of 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge &quot;Queen Emma&quot; helped transport the British 6th Airborne Division from England to France as reinforcements. It would be her last European mission. She had crossed the North Sea 43 times, sailing approximately 20,000 miles and had transported 30,000 Allied troops.

===Indian Ocean===
&quot;Queen Emma&quot; was decommissioned to be adapted for service in tropical waters at Harland &amp; Wolff at Belfast. The works were completed on 29 March 1945, and on 5 May &quot;Queen Emma&quot; sailed with Convoy KMF-44 for India, arriving at Bombay on the 26th. &quot;Queen Emma&quot; remained in India until the Japanese surrender in August. She then took part in Operation Jurist – the reoccupation of Penang by British Marines.

She then embarked French troops, and escorted by the , sailed to Saigon. On the return trip, &quot;Queen Emma&quot; was damaged by an acoustic mine. Her main engines were knocked out and the ship had to be towed. However, emergency repairs were made and she reached Singapore under her own power.

After this &quot;Queen Emma&quot; transported Dutch women and children from Japanese concentration camps, and took British troops to Batavia, Semarang and Soerabaja.

===Return to the Netherlands===
In January 1946 the ship was ordered to return to England, arriving at Portsmouth on 6 March 1946. The landing craft, weapons, and other military equipment was removed and on 29 April 1946 the &quot;Queen Emma&quot; arrived back in her home port of Vlissingen after an absence of six years to be handed back to the Dutch Government. The ship was officially returned to SMZ in early March 1946 and resumed her original name MS &quot;Koningin Emma&quot;.

Post-war shortages of materials and labour meant that it was 5 March 1948 before &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; could return to service, sailing for the first time to Harwich from the Hook of Holland. She remained in service on the same route until 1968, when she was replaced by a new generation of roll-on/roll-off ships. The thirty-year-old &quot;Koningin Emma&quot; was taken out of service and sold for scrap just before the year&#x27;s end in Antwerp.

<doc id="1165731" wikidata="Q1062203" url="?curid=1165731" title="Lee Vining, California">
<text>Lee Vining (formerly Leevining, Poverty Flat, and Lakeview) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Mono County, California, United States. It is located south-southeast of Bridgeport. Lee Vining is located on the southwest shore of Mono Lake. The population was 217 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was named after Leroy Vining, who founded the town in 1852 as a mining camp. In 1926, the town was laid out by Chris Mattly and named &quot;Lakeview&quot;, but when a post office was sought in 1928, it was learned that another town, Lakeview, California, already had the name. The name of Lee Vining was chosen in 1953. The place was also called &quot;Poverty Flat&quot; for its unfavorable conditions for agriculture.

==Geography==
Lee Vining is in western Mono County along U.S. Route 395, at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada. US 395 leads northwest to Bridgeport, the Mono county seat, and southeast the same distance to the junction for Mammoth Lakes. California State Route 120 climbs west from Lee Vining to the top of Tioga Pass, the east entrance to Yosemite National Park. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Lee Vining CDP covers an area of , 99.95% of it land and 0.05% of it water.

===Climate===
Lee Vining, on the boundary between the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin ecoregions, has a transitional climate: warmer and drier than the mountains to the west but cooler and much snowier than the vast desert to the east. Despite only getting of water-equivalent precipitation annually, the town averages nearly of snow, sometimes falling as late as April or even May. Precipitation is highest in the winter months of December through March, but some can be expected to fall every month of the year, and the town does not typically experience the four to six month dry spells of more coastal parts of California.

==Economy==
The economy of Lee Vining relies largely on tourism, since it is the closest town to the east entrance of Yosemite National Park, and is near other tourist destinations such as Mono Lake, the ghost town of Bodie, popular trout fishing destinations, and June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain ski areas and the June Lake recreational area. Although off-season tourism has increased in recent years, most tourists visit in the summer months because State Route 120 through Yosemite is often closed otherwise because of heavy snowfall in the winter. Lee Vining has a year-round information center for visitors.

==Sights==
Lee Vining is situated near the foot of Lee Vining Canyon. State Route 120 runs from town, through the canyon, up to Tioga Pass. Lee Vining Canyon is one of only two ice climbing venues in California. U.S. Route 395 also runs through the town, connecting to Los Angeles to the south, and Reno, Nevada to the north. Gus Hess Park commemorates an early miner in Lee Vining.

The town is the site of the Upside-Down House, a distinctive local landmark built by silent film actress Nellie Bly O&#x27;Bryan. Also located in the town is the Whoa Nellie Deli, which was once described by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as &quot;a misplaced Fellini set carved into the edge of the Mono Basin, dust devils skipping around in the distance like extras on the floor of Owens Valley.&quot;

The Lee Vining Airport lies near the town. The ZIP Code is 93541. The community is inside area codes 442 and 760.

<text>Charles Dietrich Eberhard Konig or Karl Dietrich Eberhard König, KH (1774 – 6 September 1851) was a German naturalist.

He was born in Brunswick and educated at Göttingen. He came to England at the end of 1800 to organize the collections of Queen Charlotte. On the completion of this work he became assistant to Dryander, librarian to Joseph Banks. In 1807, he succeeded George Shaw as assistant keeper of the department of natural history in the British Museum. On the death of his superior in 1813, he took his place as keeper.

He later became keeper of geology and mineralogy, and turned his attention to minerals and fossils, arranging the recently acquired collection of Mr. Greville. He retained the post until his sudden death in London in 1851.

Konig anglicized his name upon his appointment as assistant keeper in 1807. In 1837, following a House of Commons Select committee report on the British Museum, the Department of Natural History was divided into three branches, with Konig being put in charge of the Mineralogical and Geological branch.

Besides writing various papers for journals, Konig was associated with John Sims in the issue of &quot;Annals of Botany&quot; from 1805 to 1807. He described many fossils in the British Museum in a classic work entitled &quot;Icones fossilium sectiles&quot; (1820–1825).

<text>Paweł Janas (; born 4 March 1953) is a Polish former football manager and former player who played as a defender. He was voted the Polish Coach of the Year four times.

==Career==

===Club===
He began his playing career for the Włókniarz Pabianice team in 1965, but later left the club in 1973.

===National team===
From 1976 to 1984, he won 53 international caps for Poland. Janas played at centre-back in all seven of Poland&#x27;s games at the 1982 World Cup in Spain where the team achieved an unexpected third place.

==Manager career==
Janas&#x27; coaching career started as an assistant at Legia Warszawa in 1988. He later ended his work at Legia Warszawa in 1990, and took up a post helping Władysław Stachurski lead the Polish youth squad. He was assistant to Janusz Wójcik at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona where Poland won the silver medal. In the same year he again became Wójcik&#x27;s assistant, this time at Legia.

From 1994 to 1996, Janas was the head coach at Legia where he and his team won the Championship (1994, 1995), Polish Cup (1994, 1995), Polish Supercup (1994), as well as advanced to the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions&#x27; Cup (1995–96 season).

From 1996 to 1999, Janas coached the Polish youth/Olympic squad, which advanced to the quarter finals of the European Championships. From 1999 he worked as the manager and vice-president of sport at Amica Wronki until 2002.

On 20 December 2002, he officially took charge of the Polish national team. He was heavily criticized in the beginning of his national team spell, despite achieving good results. Nonetheless, under Janas the Poland team qualified for the 2006 World Cup, finishing second in a qualifying group behind England. They qualified as the best second placed team, scoring 27 goals in the qualifiers, 10 more than the group leaders England.

In the final tournament, Poland were drawn with Ecuador, hosts Germany and Costa Rica. Their first game, against Ecuador in Gelsenkirchen, ended in a disappointing 2–0 defeat, and Janas received criticism from the Polish press for his team selection and tactics, which involved leaving striker Maciej Żurawski alone and unsupported up front. He played a 4–5–1 formation, which he said &quot;safety first&quot;. Poland played well with 4–4–2 in the qualifiers, which resulted in flowing football.

Poland played much better in their second game, against the Germans in Dortmund, but again lost, this time 1–0 to a late goal by Oliver Neuville, despite a magnificent performance by their goalkeeper Artur Boruc. This meant that the third match, against Costa Rica in Hamburg, was meaningless; Poland won 2–1 with two goals by defender Bartosz Bosacki. Janas was sacked from his post by the Polish FA after the tournament.

In 2008, he became manager of Ekstraklasa side GKS Bełchatów, leading them to a 5th place standing at the half-way point of the 2008–09 season but resigned during the winter break, citing lack of squad depth which would not allow the team to challenge for a higher position.

In January 2009, he accepted the managerial position at Widzew Łódź. In June, the club won the second division but was not allowed to advance by the PZPN. After winning the title again in 2010, Janas decided to leave the club in June.

In September, he became a manager at Polonia Warsaw.

In August 2013, he was appointed as manager at Bytovia Bytów. On 24 May 2014 his club was promoted to Polish I liga.

<text>Gabriel Zaid is a Mexican writer, poet and intellectual.

==Early life==
He was born in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, on January 24, 1934, son of Palestinian immigrants, is a Mexican thinker (poet, essayist, economist, businessman, engineer, anarchist, reader, Catholic, liberal, critical of progress that does not produce) difficult to classify due to its wide variety of knowledge and culture.

He has been recognized, mainly, for his critical essays, which cover topics on politics, culture and the economy of Mexico.

He is considered an independent intellectual, since he publishes on his own and in favor of readers. He has never worked for universities, neither for the government nor political parties.

He studied Engineering at the Tecnológico de Monterrey.

He was a member of the Board of Directors of the &quot;Vuelta &quot; magazine from 1976 to 1992. He has been a member of El Colegio Nacional since September 26, 1984. He has been a member of the Mexican Academy of Language since 1986. He has distinguished himself for never appearing in public—not even his picture has been taken. This springs from a strongly held opinion that a writer should be known by his work, not his real life personality. His essays have been very influential on a vast array of topics, most significantly poetry, economics, and criticism of the literary establishment.

<text>Berzelius is a lunar impact crater located in the northeast part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies to the southeast of the crater Franklin, and to the northwest of Geminus.

Berzelius is a low, eroded formation with a fairly level interior floor and a small, ridge-like rim. There are several tiny craterlets along the rim, and the wall is nearly gone along the southern side – it consists of little more than a low, wide ridge. The interior floor is marked by a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berzelius.

<text>Angel Witch are a British heavy metal band which formed in London in 1976. Despite never achieving major success, they were an integral part of the early 1980s new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) movement, and have been acknowledged as an influence by many bands of the then-emerging thrash, speed, doom and extreme metal genres. Angel Witch have released five studio albums to date, and have undergone numerous lineup changes throughout their -year career, leaving frontman and lead guitarist Kevin Heybourne as the only constant member.

==Biography==
===Formation===
The band formed, originally under the name of Lucifer, with guitarist and vocalist Kevin Heybourne, guitarist Rob Downing, drummer Steve Jones, and bassist Barry Clements. Lucifer split and Jones joined Bruce Dickinson to form Speed. The remnants of Lucifer became Angel Witch, with the exceptions of Clements, who was replaced by Kevin Riddles, and Jones, who was replaced by Steve Coleman. The following year Downing left the band.

===Limited chart success, brief record deal===
Angel Witch&#x27;s first song to achieve mainstream popularity was &quot;Baphomet&quot;, which was included on a compilation titled &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot;. This song drew a fair amount of attention to the band, and they signed a recording deal with EMI. However, the deal was cancelled, due to manager Ken Heybourne refusing to hand Angel Witch over to professional management, and the poor performance of their first single released under the EMI label in 1980. Entitled &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;, it lasted a single week on the UK Singles Chart. This was their only UK chart listing and despite being quite an achievement for a NWOBHM group, spending a single week at No. 75 (the lowest position in the charts) meant they were listed as the &quot;least successful chart act of all time&quot; in the &quot;Guinness Book of Hit Records&quot;. This same feat was repeated by fellow NWOBHM group Grand Prix with their &quot;Keep on Believing&quot; 7&quot; in 1983.

===Debut album===
In 1980, Bronze Records picked up the band and they recorded and released their debut album, self-titled &quot;Angel Witch&quot;.

===Break-ups and reunions===
Subsequent to the album&#x27;s release, the band fell apart. Dave Hogg was fired, and Kevin Riddles left the band to form Tytan. Despite Heybourne&#x27;s attempts to continue Angel Witch with other musicians, the end of the band was declared and he joined Deep Machine.

Angel Witch returned to activity in 1982, when Heybourne and two musicians from Deep Machine - namely vocalist Roger Marsden and drummer Ricky Bruce - left to assemble a new Angel Witch line-up together with bassist Jerry Cunningham. This line-up lasted a very short time, as Marsden&#x27;s voice did not fit the style of the band very well. He was fired from the band and Heybourne assumed the vocals once more.

By 1983, the band had ceased its activities, and Heybourne moved to Blind Fury. In 1984, Angel Witch was once more brought to life, this time with the help of bassist Peter Gordelier (ex-Marquis De Sade), singer Dave Tattum and with Dave Hogg returning to the drums. This line-up recorded the album &quot;Screamin&#x27; N&#x27; Bleedin″&quot;. Dave Hogg was sacked again. He was replaced by Spencer Hollman. With the new drummer they recorded &quot;Frontal Assault&quot;, which deviated heavily from Angel Witch&#x27;s previous albums, having many melodic elements.

Dave Tattum was released the same year and for a few years Angel Witch played as a trio on sporadic live performances. In 1989, they recorded a live album, entitled simply &quot;Live&quot;.

===Creation of American group===
Heybourne decided that it was in the band&#x27;s best interest to move to the United States, but the other members had no way of accomplishing that, having stable lives in their home country. Thus, an American incarnation of Angel Witch was born. It was composed of Heybourne, bassist Jon Torres (Lȧȧz Rockit, Ulysses Siren), drummer Tom Hunting (Exodus) and guitarist Doug Piercy (Heathen, Anvil Chorus). This line-up functioned quite well, and soon the band had booked a fair number of shows throughout the US. However, Heybourne had some pending issues regarding immigration, and he was arrested one day before the first concert of the band. Without Heybourne, Angel Witch was dissolved.

===New lineup in the 2000s and 2010s===
After the release of the &quot;Resurrection&quot; compilation album in 2000, the band intended to play together once more, but after a series of internal conflicts, Heybourne assembled another line-up, with new members. They were on the bill for the traditional Orange Goblin Christmas show at The Camden Underworld, London, on 20 December 2008. In 2009, their eponymous song &quot;Angel Witch&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the action-adventure videogame, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

In 2011, Angel Witch entered the studio to record their fourth studio album, entitled &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;, with Kevin Heybourne on guitar and vocals, Will Palmer on bass guitar, Bill Steer on guitar, and Andrew Prestidge on drums. They also returned to playing live, with a second stage headline slot at Bloodstock Open Air in 2011.

One-time Angel Witch bassist Jon Torres died on 3 September 2013 of a reported heart failure. He was 51 years old.

The band toured and played festivals in 2015 and 2018.

On 30 August 2019, the band released a new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Your Back&quot; which debuted at number 17 on the Kerrang! Rock Chart before rising to 14 in its second and final week.

==Legacy==
Angel Witch have been cited as an influence by many notable metal bands, including Metallica, Venom, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Celtic Frost, Death, Candlemass and Megadeth, the latter of whose lead singer Dave Mustaine graced the February 2010 cover of &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine wearing an Angel Witch shirt. Bands that have covered Angel Witch songs in concert or on record include Trouble (&quot;Confused&quot; live), Six Feet Under (&quot;Confused&quot; on &quot;Graveyard Classics&quot;), Blood Curse (&quot;Angel Witch&quot; on their debut album &quot;Sorceress&quot;), Onslaught (&quot;Confused&quot; on &quot;In Search of Sanity&quot;), Skull Fist (&quot;Angel Witch&quot; live), Battle Ram (&quot;Angel Witch&quot; on the &quot;Smash the Gates&quot; EP), S.A. Slayer (&quot;Dr. Phibes&quot; &amp; &quot;Angel Witch&quot; live), Exodus (&quot;Angel of Death&quot; on &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; as bonus track) and Amazing Maze, which is a one off album by Italian Power Metal band Labyrinth under a different name (&quot;Angel Witch&quot;).

In 2007, German label Unbroken Records issued a &quot;Tribute to Angel Witch&quot; compilation album featuring 15 underground metal acts covering songs from the band&#x27;s early singles and first three full-length releases.

<doc id="1165750" wikidata="Q7100677" url="?curid=1165750" title="Order of the Palmetto">
<text>The Order of the Palmetto is the highest civilian honor awarded by the governor of South Carolina. It is awarded to South Carolinians who demonstrate extraordinary lifetime achievement, service and contributions of national or statewide significance.

==History==
Governor John West created the Order of the Palmetto in 1971 to recognize lifetime achievement and service by South Carolina residents and those born in the state. It is thought to be modeled on similar honors bestowed in other states, such as the Kentucky Colonel.

Over the years, the honor program has been modified. In 1997, Governor David Beasley established the Order of the Silver Crescent as a companion award to the Order of the Palmetto to recognize contributions by persons younger than 18. In 1999, Governor Jim Hodges created a non-partisan screening panel to review nominations. The eligibility criteria for the Order of the Silver Crescent was changed to make it an auxiliary award honoring achievement or service at the local level, without restrictions of age. In 2003, Governor Mark Sanford created a panel to establish firm criteria for award eligibility, with the goal of changing the perception that the order was a political send-off. 

As of 2004, over 3,500 people have been honored with the Order of the Palmetto. Awardees include the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, which Governor Jim Hodges recognized in 1999 for its charity efforts. Governors Henry McMaster and Nikki Haley received the award prior to their assuming office. Mary Simms Oliphant, honored in 1982, was the first woman to receive the award. Other notable recipients include novelist Pat Conroy, civil rights activist Septima Poinsette Clark, football coach Lou Holtz, naturalist Rudy Mancke, and musician James Brown.

==Award==
The award comes in the form of a certificate or plaque that, in part, reads:

In grateful recognition of your contributions and friendship to the State of South Carolina and her people, I do hereby confer unto you the Order of the Palmetto with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.

<text>George Frost (1720–1796) was an American seaman, jurist, and statesman from Durham, New Hampshire. He was a delegate for New Hampshire in the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1779.

George was born in New Castle, New Hampshire, on April 26, 1720. His father, John Frost, who had been a British naval officer, died when he was twelve. He moved to Kittery, Maine, and was cared for by his uncle, William Pepperrell. As a young man he went to sea in one of his uncle’s ships. He was at sea over twenty years, many of them as captain of a merchant vessel.

He returned to New Castle about 1760, still following a mercantile career. After marrying in Durham, he finally settled there in 1769. Frost was made a justice of the Strafford County, New Hampshire, court of common pleas in 1773, and would remain in that post until 1791.

In 1777, New Hampshire sent Frost as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he served until 1779. On his return he was named to the state’s Governor’s Council in 1781. The Council at the time functioned as the upper house of the state legislature, and he served there until 1784.

George Frost died on June 21, 1796, at home in Durham. He is buried in Pine Hill Cemetery.

<text>Cinderella Castle is a fairy tale castle at the center of two Disney theme parks: the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disneyland at the Tokyo Disney Resort. Based on Cinderella&#x27;s fairy tale castle from Disney&#x27;s 1950 animated feature film, both serve as the symbol and flagship attraction for their respective theme parks. Along with Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Castle is a main symbol of the Walt Disney Company.

==Exterior==

===Inspiration and design===
Cinderella Castle was inspired by a variety of real and fictional palaces. These included Alcázar of Segovia, Schwerin Castle, Hohenzollern Castle, Château d&#x27;Ussé, Château de Saumur, Pierrefonds, Chambord, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria and Craigievar Castle in Scotland. Other sources of inspiration include the spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, the Moszna Castle in Poland, built in the 18th century, and the Týn Church in Prague, Czech Republic, built in the 14th century. The chief designer of the castle, Herbert Ryman, also referenced the original design for the castle in the film franchise &quot;Cinderella&quot; and his own well-known creation— Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in California.
===Construction===

====Magic Kingdom====

Cinderella Castle was completed in July 1971, after about 18 months of construction. The castle is tall, as measured from water-level. By adding the depth of the moat, at the bridge, it totals . Cinderella Castle is more than taller than Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. A set-building trick known as forced perspective makes the castle appear larger than it is. At higher elevations, its proportions to full scale are reduced for elements such as stones, windows, and doors. This castle and its near-twin in Tokyo were the tallest Disney theme park castles until the completion of the Enchanted Storybook Castle in Shanghai Disneyland Park.

Cinderella Castle is designed to reflect the late-Gothic, flamboyant style of the 1400s. Unlike Disneyland&#x27;s castle, no gold is used on the exterior; all gold colors are anodized aluminum. Despite its appearance, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure consists of six hundred tons of steel-braced frame construction, with a reinforced concrete wall encircling the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a concrete drilled caisson foundation. Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly believed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by light-gauge metal studs. Most fiberglass work is reserved for the exterior walls of more ornate upper towers. The roofs are not fiberglass, either. They are shingled in the same type of plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of light gauge steel sheeting over the steel sub-frame. These towers were lifted by crane, then welded and bolted permanently to the main structure. Contrary to a popular legend, the castle cannot be taken apart or moved in any way in the event of a hurricane. It would take months to disassemble, it would be too dangerous to operate the crane required in windy conditions, and there would have to be a more structurally sound building to keep it in. As with every other building at Walt Disney World, it was simply efficient enough in design to handle a hurricane. It can easily withstand the 125 mph (200 km/h) wind speeds in Central Florida.

Cinderella Castle is also surrounded by a moat, which contains approximately of water; however, unlike the drawbridge at Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland, Cinderella Castle cannot raise its bridge. There are a total of 27 towers on the castle, each numbered 1-29—tower numbers 13 and 17 were cancelled before construction when it was discovered that they could not really be seen from anywhere in the park, due mainly to the other Fantasyland buildings. The tower with the clock in front is number 10, the tallest is number 20. Number 23 is the other golden-roofed tower.

Originally, a suite was planned for the Disney family and executives, but since Walt Disney died nearly five years before the park opened, it remained unfinished, and eventually was turned successively into a telephone call center, a dressing room, and is currently a hotel room. There are three elevators inside the castle. One is for guest use and goes between the lobby of Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table and the second floor restaurant. The second is for restaurant staff use, and is located in tower 2 to the left of the drawbridge. It has landings in the Utilidors, the mezzanine level in a break room, and on the second floor in the kitchen. The third elevator is in tower 20, and services the Utilidors, the breezeway, the kitchen of Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table, and the Cinderella Castle Suite. The suite is about below the level where the zipline cable that Tinker Bell &quot;flies&quot; on for the fireworks show is attached to tower 20. Access to the cable is by ladder. From January 2007 to December 2009 the suite was used as a prize for the Disney Dreams Giveaway at the Walt Disney World Resort during the Year of a Million Dreams/35 anniversary celebration.

Cinderella Castle was designed so that it was tall enough to be seen from the Seven Seas Lagoon in front of the Magic Kingdom, where many guests took ferries from the parking lot to the gates of the park. In theme park jargon, Cinderella Castle was conceived as the primary &quot;weenie&quot; (a term commonly used by Walt and his Imagineers) that draws new entering guests through Main Street, U.S.A. towards the central hub, from where all other areas can be reached.

On February 17, 2020, in honor of the 70th anniversary of the release of the 1950 Disney animated film &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Disney announced the castle will be getting repainted within the spring &amp; summer 2020 with dark blue roofs, a slight rose pink color, and will have many gold trim accents on the castle, along with darker stone similar to Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle. Disney has assured that the castle will still be fully visible while the work is on going, and the fireworks shows will continue. However, COVID-19 forced the park to close from March to July 2020 so most of the work was done when the park closed. The paint job was completed in July 2020 shortly after the reopening of Walt Disney World. Originally, the tower spires were painted a bluish-purple, but were painted back to royal blue in Spring 2021 as Disney began installing the 50th anniversary decorations on the Castle.

As of late Spring 2021, Cinderella Castle has been decorated with what Disney calls &quot;EARidescent&quot; gold and blue bunting, ribbons and other decorations. Cinderella Castle was fully decorated with these through April 2, 2023 when the decorations began to be removed in phases following the end of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Magical Celebration&quot;.

====Tokyo Disneyland====

In general, Cinderella Castle in Tokyo Disneyland has a near identical appearance to the castle at the Magic Kingdom. However, it has a different color scheme and is slightly shorter, standing at .

From 1986 to 2006, the castle hosted a walk-through attraction called the &quot;Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour&quot;; centered primarily on Disney villains (particularly the Horned King from &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;), this was one of Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s first unique attractions, and the longest-lasting. In June 2006, the castle was repainted to differentiate it from Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom. The castle now has gold trimmings, the rooftops have been painted a different shade of blue, and the white stone of the turrets now has a tan/dirty-pink color.

In 2018, Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s Cinderella Castle received water fountains installed for a new nighttime presentation &quot;Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland&quot; which premiered on July 10, as part of its 35th Anniversary celebration.

===Special decorations===
Cinderella Castle has been temporarily re-decorated on a few occasions.

==== Magic Kingdom ====
# To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort on October 1, 1996, Imagineers transformed the front of Cinderella Castle into an 18-story &quot;birthday cake.&quot; Complete with red and pink &quot;icing,&quot; giant candy canes and 26 glowing candles, the castle served as the centerpiece for the 15-month-long celebration. Designed by Walt Disney Entertainment Florida and later constructed by the Imagineers, this was no small undertaking. It took more than of pink paint to cover the castle, which was decorated with multicolored &quot;sprinkles,&quot; 26 candles, ranging in height from 20 to 40 feet (6.1–12.2 m) tall, 16 two-foot (61 cm) long candy stars, 16 five-foot (1.5 m) candy bears, 12 five-foot (1.5 m) gumdrops, four six-foot (1.8 m) stacks of Life Savers, 30 three-foot (91 cm) lollipops, and 50 two-foot (61 cm) gumballs. Additionally, more than 1000 feet (305 m) of pink and blue inflatable &quot;icing&quot; was needed to finish it off. On January 31, 1998, the castle was transformed back to its original state.
# On November 16, 2004, the castle was modified to appear as though it was strewn with toilet paper, and &quot;Stitch is King&quot; was posted on a turret as faux graffiti to mark the grand opening of Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape! that day. The material was removed after the park closed that evening.
# To celebrate the Happiest Celebration on Earth in honor of Disneyland&#x27;s 50th anniversary and was formally unveiled on May 5, 2005. The castle&#x27;s exterior was adorned with polished gold trim and accents, swags, banners and tapestries. Golden statues of Disney animated characters were also added to the exterior, including Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and Wendy Darling circling the tallest spire. Other statues included Kaa and King Louie from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Sebastian and Flounder from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, the Cheshire Cat and White Rabbit from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and Victor, Hugo and Laverne from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Just above the front archway sat an enormous &quot;stained-glass&quot; mirror modeled after the magic mirror in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The mirror changed images every 40 seconds to feature each Disney castle and the date its park opened: Disneyland, 1955; the Magic Kingdom, 1971; Tokyo Disneyland, 1983; Disneyland Resort Paris, 1992; and Hong Kong Disneyland, 2005. The decorations were removed in late September 2006.
# The castle&#x27;s most recent redecoration was to celebrate Walt Disney World&#x27;s 50th anniversary, known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Magical Celebration&quot;, which began on October 1, 2021, and lasted through March 31, 2023. The design was first revealed on February 19, 2021, with most of the decorations being installed from March 11 to April 16, 2021. The &quot;EARidescent&quot; pieces, as Disney refers to them, include gold detailing, royal blue jewels, shimmering pearls, draping and ribbons on the castle&#x27;s turrets. The final decoration is a giant 50th crest that covers the clock on the front face of the castle, which was installed the night of July 22, 2021. The decorations began to be removed the night of April 2, 2023 following the final performance of &quot;Disney Enchantment&quot; with the removal of the 50th crest, and the last was removed the night of May 22, 2023.

==== Tokyo Disneyland ====

# As part of the 25th anniversary of Tokyo Disneyland on April 15, 2008, the castle received decorations similar to the 2021 50th anniversary WDW castle with only the 2 turrets decorated in purple and white banners and gold/sliver ribbons on the rooftops. The 25th crest was hung lower on the balcony railing instead of the clock itself.
# During the 30th anniversary, the castle was decorated to feature mickey balloons and ribbons and spirals. The 30th crest was located in the same location of where the 25th crest was located.
# The castle&#x27;s most recent and current redecoration is to celebrate Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s 40th anniversary, which began on April 15, 2023. This included banners on the walls of the 2 front turrets of the castle. the 40th crest was in the same location just like the past celebrations. The decorations were removed from April 1–8, 2024.

===At night===
When the sun sets, the castle is illuminated by SGM Palco LED lighting fixtures placed on different castle levels and surrounding areas, providing an effective range of 16.7 million colors. The castle itself plays a role in the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s former fireworks show, &quot;&quot;, in which it changes color in synchronization with the dramatic music of the display. The same color changing and effects occurs for the other fireworks shows: &quot;HalloWishes&quot; (in Mickey&#x27;s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party); &quot;Magic, Music and Mayhem&quot; (during Disney&#x27;s Pirate and Princess Party); and the Christmas fireworks show &quot;Holiday Wishes&quot; during Mickey&#x27;s Very Merry Christmas Party. The castle&#x27;s projection mapping technology has been used in several night events, such as their current fireworks spectacular, &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, and its predecessor, &quot;Disney Enchantment&quot;. During the holiday seasons, various shows have utilized projection mapping, including &quot;Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular&quot;, along with the Halloween themed &quot;Disney&#x27;s Not-So-Spooky Spectacular&quot; and Holiday overlayed show, &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks&quot;.

At the park&#x27;s closing, the nightly &quot;Kiss Goodnight&quot; was performed, in which Roy O. Disney&#x27;s dedication speech for the Magic Kingdom is played throughout all over the park accompanied by Disney music which changes with the colors of the castle. Even when the park closes before 11pm (23:00), the show is performed a second time at 11pm (23:00), providing entertainment for guests of Disney resort hotels bordering the Seven Seas Lagoon. This practice seems to have ended in 2020 after the park reopened from Covid-19. Beginning November 2007, for the first time, the &quot;Castle Dream Lights&quot;, with over 200,000 LED Christmas lights (as Disneyland Paris has since 2004), covered Cinderella Castle and was lit nightly during a stage show in front of the castle. The last showing was in 2019 whereas it never returned once again starting in 2020.

===&quot;The Magic, the Memories and You&quot;===


On January 18, 2011, a nighttime projection mapping show premiered at Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. The show featured photographs and videos of park guests, taken by Disney&#x27;s PhotoPass employees, combined with projections of Disney characters and attractions and pre-selected music. &quot;The Magic, the Memories and You&quot; show was presented before and after the nightly &quot;&quot; fireworks show at Magic Kingdom, as well as presented before and after Disneyland&#x27;s regular nightly fireworks, and was part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Let the Memories Begin&quot; campaign for 2011 as well as Disney World&#x27;s 40th Anniversary celebrations that same year. A parallel show existed at Disneyland, at the Disneyland Resort, taking place at the facade of It&#x27;s a Small World. On September 3, this show ended its run and was replaced by a similar nighttime multimedia show, &quot;Celebrate the Magic&quot;, in 2012 and again by &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in Fall 2016.

&quot;The Magic, The Memories and You&quot; is also inspired the similar theme song for &quot;Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland&quot; as part of the Tokyo Disney Resort&#x27;s 35th Anniversary celebration that premiered at Tokyo Disneyland on July 10, 2018, which also created as a tribute to both the former nighttime projection show and &quot;Remember... Dreams Come True&quot;.

At Disneyland, the show was replaced with Disneyland Forever in 2015, a similar show now featuring projections at Sleeping Beauty Castle and Main Street, USA in addition to the facade of It&#x27;s a Small World.

==Interior==

===Mosaics===
Inside the castle&#x27;s archway, a series of five mosaic murals tells the story of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Designed by Imagineer Dorothea Redmond and crafted and set in place by a team of six artists led by mosaicist Hanns-Joachim Scharff, the ornate panels are shaped in a Gothic arch. The murals took 22 months to complete and contain just over 300,000 pieces of Italian glass and rough smalti (glass made specifically for mosaics traditionally used by Italian craftsmen) in more than 500 colors. Many of the hand-cut tiles are fused with sterling silver and 14-karat (58 percent) gold, and some are as small as the head of a tack. Looking closely at these ornate murals, one will notice that each of Cinderella&#x27;s wicked stepsisters appears with a little added color—one sister&#x27;s face is clearly &quot;red with anger&quot;, while the other is a little &quot;green with envy&quot; as they watch Cinderella try on the glass slipper.

===Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique===
As of September 10, 2007, the castle is home to the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, first introduced at Disney Springs (formerly known as Downtown Disney). Inside, guests can receive a so-called &quot;princess transformation&quot;, which features a Disney Princess make-up, one of three hairstyles, a manicure, a sash, and/or a gown, tiara, wand and shoes.

The King&#x27;s Gallery, the former gift shop in this space, has moved to the Main Street Cinema on Main Street, U.S.A.

===Cinderella Castle Suite===
Inside the upper levels of Cinderella Castle, there is a suite. This space is not large, and can be compared to the size of a master bedroom and bathroom in an average house. The location of the suite can be identified from the outside by locating the stained glass windows with pictures in the center on the north and west sides of the castle room on the 4th floor, about 2/3 of the way up. The glass used contains many small, multi-faceted pieces, which slightly obscures the view of the park with fireworks show from inside the suite by added music. The suite adjoins a sizable exterior balcony on the east side. The walls around this balcony are about 5 feet (1.5 m) high. This balcony affords views to the north, east, and south. The balcony is only accessible through an emergency exit and is not a guest area.

On June 7, 2005, Disney announced that the suite would be completely decorated and upholstered as a &#x27;royal bedchamber&#x27;, which can sleep up to six people. It was available as a prize during the Year of a Million Dreams (2007) celebration taking place at all eleven Disney theme parks, and an overnight stay in the apartment was a prize randomly awarded to a guest at the four Walt Disney World theme parks and Downtown Disney. They have discontinued spending the night in the castle as of 2009.

===Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table===
Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table, formerly known as King Stefan&#x27;s Banquet Hall, is a restaurant inside the castle. Located on the second floor, guests can take the circular stairway or the elevator to the restaurant, where children are referred to as princes and princesses, while the adults in the party are referred to as lords and ladies. Walt Disney Imagineers had originally wanted to give the restaurant a regal name, and since there are no well-known characters from &quot;Cinderella&quot; that met their criteria, they instead took a little dramatic license and chose the name of Sleeping Beauty&#x27;s father, King Stefan. The name was changed on April 28, 1997, in order not to confuse tourists. The restaurant is decorated not only with a number of stained glass windows and medieval objects, but with more than forty coats of arms. Each of these is an actual family seal, and represent some of the many people that played a major role in the design and construction of Walt Disney World, including Roger Broggie Sr. (Imagineer and railroad aficionado who aided in the design of many attractions), Marc Davis (animator and theme park designer), Roy O. Disney (Walt&#x27;s brother), John Hench (who designed the castle), Diane Disney Miller (Walt&#x27;s daughter), Dick Nunis (former Chairman of Walt Disney Attractions), and Marty Sklar (Imagineering vice chairman and principal creative executive who worked alongside Walt Disney).

Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table is also the location of &quot;Fairytale Dining at Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table.&quot; At breakfast, lunch and dinner Cinderella greets all guests in the castle foyer, and during the meal Disney princesses such as Ariel, Aurora, Jasmine, Snow White, and sometimes Rapunzel circulate among the tables.

===Cinderella&#x27;s Fairy Tale Hall (Tokyo Disneyland)===
Cinderella&#x27;s Fairy Tale Hall is a walk-through attraction located inside Cinderella Castle at Tokyo Disneyland. Cinderella, wanting to share her magical princess story, decided to open up the castle even during her absence and exhibit various artworks that show scenes from her story. At the lobby and corridor, guests will find eight murals showing how Cinderella changed from beloved daughter, to servant girl, and then to Princess. They will also see a diorama of Cinderella magically transformed into wearing a beautiful ball gown, and other artworks made from various materials such as paper, wood and glass. In the Grand Hall guests will find a magnificent chandelier, the renowned glass slipper, a throne, and special paintings that reveal a magical message when photographed using a flash.

===Flight regulations (Walt Disney World)===
By keeping the height of the castle&#x27;s spire under tall, the castle at Walt Disney World was able to avoid Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that would require flashing aircraft warning lights at the top. The two taller attractions at Walt Disney World, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror and Expedition Everest, top out at 199 and 199.5 feet, respectively, to avoid this requirement as well.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks, amid concerns that general aviation could pose a threat to public safety, the FAA placed a permanent Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) over the entire Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The flight restriction extends outward from an island near the Contemporary Resort () at a radius of up to above the ground level surface. Cinderella Castle is used as a visual reference. It has been a common growing legend that Disney chose to prohibit aviation above the park in order to make visitors feel even further separate from the outside world, but the true reason was, in fact, in response to the September 11th attacks. Law enforcement and Walt Disney World Cessna 172 aircraft, however, are exempt from this TFR.

==Logo usage==
As Cinderella Castle is a Disney icon and Walt Disney World was gaining more popularity, it replaced Sleeping Beauty Castle in the opening of the Walt Disney anthology series starting in the late 1970s. Since 2006, both castles were combined to form the logo of Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television, Disney Music Group and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The logo is now featured on the &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; on ABC, formerly shown on the Disney Channel.

<text>Birkeland is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. This crater is attached to the central waist of the oddly shaped Van de Graaff crater formation, and may partly account for that crater&#x27;s figure-8 shape. To the southeast is the large walled plain Leibnitz.

This crater has not been significantly eroded, and the outer rim is well-defined with a well-d inner walls around much of the interior. The rim has a slight inward bulge along the north where it is attached to the Van de Graaff formation. The interior floor is relatively level, except in the southeast where there is some rough terrain. There is a central peak formation at the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Birkeland.

<text>Anywhere but Home is the first live album and concert DVD release by American rock band Evanescence. It was released on November 23, 2004, by Wind-up Records. It includes a recording of a concert at Le Zénith in Paris, an hour of behind the scenes footage, three previously-unreleased songs, and all four of the &quot;Fallen&quot; music videos.

==Background and release==
&quot;Anywhere but Home&quot; was filmed during Evanescence&#x27;s concert at Le Zénith in Paris on May 25, 2004. The concert was part of the tour in support of their debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003). Every song from the album except &quot;Hello&quot; was performed at the show.

Three new songs were released on &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;: &quot;Missing&quot;, &quot;Breathe No More&quot; (which was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film &quot;Elektra&quot;), and &quot;Farther Away&quot;. While placed at the end of the disc, the CD insert shows &quot;Missing&quot; as track eight but it is actually track 14 and incorrectly labeled &quot;Whisper&quot;.

A secret performance of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada can be found on the DVDs main menu by moving the cursor to the largest thorn on the left-hand side of the screen. The band symbol then becomes visible. When selected, this will take the user to the hidden footage.

In December 2004, a couple in Maryland who had bought the album for their daughter, filed a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart after hearing the word &quot;fuck&quot; sung during &quot;Thoughtless&quot;, a cover of a Korn song. The lawsuit claimed that while the album contained this explicit word, there was no Parental Advisory sticker on the package. It also claimed that the album violated Wal-Mart&#x27;s policy of not stocking music with explicit lyrics, and that the company had to be aware of the problem because the word was dubbed out of a free sample on the Walmart.com website. The lawsuit was resolved by court order of a deal which would allow those people who bought the album at a Maryland Wal-Mart location to receive a refund. Some copies have the Parental Advisory notice, yet other copies are still sold without it now.

==Reception==
Johny Loftus of AllMusic deemed the album a &quot;fine holdover&quot; until the band&#x27;s second studio album, and stated that it &quot;reasserts Amy Lee&#x27;s position at Evanescence&#x27;s center&quot; while she was &quot;always the singular force&quot; of Evanescence, with her &quot;powerful vocals, strident public persona, and striking fashion sense [breaking] down the doors of the alternative metal boys club.&quot; He further praised Lee&#x27;s vocals and engagement with the crowd. Geoff Barton of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; graded &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot; with four out of five stars.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album debuted at number 39 on December 11, 2004, selling 59,000 copies in its first week. On the Spanish DVD Chart, &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot; debuted at number one for the week ending November 28, 2004; it became the best-selling music DVD of 2004 in Spain.

<doc id="1165776" wikidata="Q1463687" url="?curid=1165776" title="Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve">
<text>Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve is a protected area which encompasses most of the Suikerbosrand Range, South Africa. It is one of Gauteng&#x27;s most frequented ecotourism locations, located approximately 50 kilometres south-east of Johannesburg, just west of the town of Heidelberg in the upper catchment of the Klip and Suikerbosrand rivers. The altitude varies between above sea level.

The reserve, which is , hosts a representative sample of the fauna and flora of the rocky highveld grassland biome. Its boundaries include hiking trails, and tarred circular route for motorists.

==History==
The Suikerbosrand ridge was originally named after a sweet reed (probably sweet sorghum) found growing here by the party of general Hendrik Potgieter on 5 June 1836. Later the ridge and consequently the reserve&#x27;s name became associated with the characteristic Transvaal-sugar bush (&quot;Protea afra&quot;), a dominant vegetation type within the area&#x27;s limits.

Recent land acquisitions at the beginning of the twenty-first century have seen the reserve almost double in its size. A huge challenge for the reserve&#x27;s management is to include the newly acquired lands in the reserve without disturbing the balance within the original area. The Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve is managed by the Gauteng province&#x27;s Department of Agriculture, Conservation, Environment and Land Affairs, South Africa.

==Wildlife==
Over 200 bird species have been identified in the reserve. The reserve is also a habitat for a large range of mammal species including the animals listed below.
==Cycling and mountain biking==
The reserve is popular amongst mountain bikers and road cyclists for its quiet roads and trails, scenery, steep climbs, and fast twisting descents.

==Hiking==
The reserve includes a Visitors&#x27; Centre and the Diepkloof Farm Museum. The area is available on foot and contains several day and overnight hiking trails.

==Holiday resort==
A holiday resort for day visitors (apparently day visitors are no longer allowed in at Kareekloof) and overnight campers is situated within the nature reserve. (It was previously known as Kareekloof)

Accommodation is in the form of chalets, caravan (some with 240 V power) and tent sites.

<text>Trouble is a five-issue romance comic book limited series published in 2003 by Marvel Comics as a part of its Epic Comics imprint. Written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Terry and Rachel Dodson, the series deals with teen pregnancy. The basic concept was created by Bill Jemas and Joe Quesada.

&quot;Trouble&quot; was meant to re-popularize romance comics (which were very popular in the 1950s, selling millions of copies), but failed.

A trade paperback collecting the five issues was originally scheduled to be published on 18 February 2004, but canceled when Epic was shut down after Bill Jemas, who had been a driving force behind the imprint, resigned as president of Marvel Comics. A hardcover collection was published by Marvel on June 1, 2011.

==Characters==
* May Reilly – A 17-year-old redhead and something of a wild child.
* Mary Fitzpatrick – May&#x27;s blonde best friend and rather shy.
* Ben Parker – Richard&#x27;s older brother, who was often in hospitals as a child.
* Richard (Richie) Parker – Ben&#x27;s younger brother and their dad&#x27;s clear favorite.

==Plot summary==
May and her best friend Mary work in a resort in the Hamptons during their summer vacation, looking for some fun away from home. Soon they make friends with fellow service staff members Richard and his brother Ben, and the four of them begin hanging out. After a couple of days of hard work and being bossed about by the guests, May and Mary go to a dance together. After the dance and a round of night swimming, they head back to their rooms; May takes Ben to her room and sleeps with him, while Mary tells Richie it is too fast for her, and she wants to wait before having sex with him. She later reveals to him it is because a palm-reader told her she would become a mom before she was twenty if she had sex in her teens. The same fortune-teller also told May nobody was ever going to call her &quot;mom&quot;, which explains why May is so open in her relationships. Richie is not very understanding of her reasons for not sleeping with him, and starts an affair with May. May tells Mary she is cheating on Ben, but not with whom. A while later, she finds out that she is pregnant. Upon realizing the fortune-teller must have been wrong, Mary now finally sleeps with Richie, who then ends the affair with May. When May reveals her pregnancy to Ben, it turns out he&#x27;s sterile and her affair with Richie, who must be the father, is uncovered. May is thinking about having an abortion, but decides against it. Afraid of going home and facing her dad with an unwanted child, May runs away.

May finds a man to stay with, but does not tell him about her pregnancy. She grows to be disgusted by him. May contacts Mary and meets with her. Mary is still very angry with May for having an affair with Richie, and tells her she deserves all the trouble she is going through, but decides to help her when May tells her she has been thinking about suicide. Mary comes up with the plan to tell everybody the baby is hers, so May will not have to face her fundamentalist parents and Mary can test if she can trust Richie, who is still in love with her and writing her frequent letters, none of which she has answered yet. Once May gives birth to her healthy baby boy, Peter, Mary takes him to Richie, and they start a family, while May returns home to her parents as if nothing had happened.

==Covers==
All issues of &quot;Trouble&quot; featured photo covers by French photographer Philippe Bialobos in the style of teen romance novels, which is unusual for an American comic book series, with cover design by Joe Quesada. These covers were to appeal to a female audience (Marvel originally hoped for high sales outside the comic scene, particularly with a collected edition that was to be heavily promoted in many bookstores, but never published after the series did not do well in the direct market).

The second printing of the first issue (&quot;Trouble #1: The Second Chances Edition&quot;) was the only one to feature a conventional comic book cover, drawn by Frank Cho.

==Reception==
The reveal that series&#x27; main characters, May, Ben, Mary and Richard, are meant to be Peter Parker&#x27;s Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and his parents Richard and Mary Parker, and thus, the revelation that the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Aunt May is actually Peter Parker&#x27;s biological mother was seen as highly controversial among Spider-Man fans, with many criticisms of the series mistakenly implying the series to be set in Marvel&#x27;s primary continuity, with Millar&#x27;s dialogue being criticized as not being representative of the time it is set in (supposedly the 1970s) and his storytelling failing to grab the audience; many complained that the characters were written too similarly, and were hard to keep apart, &quot;save for the fact that one of the girls will do it on the first date when the other one won&#x27;t&quot;. In contrast, Dodson&#x27;s artwork throughout the series was praised.

<text>Charles Everett Traynor (August 21, 1937 – July 22, 2002) was an American actor, businessman and talent agent best known for having promoted the careers of pornographic film stars Linda Lovelace and Marilyn Chambers, both of whom were also married to him. Lovelace wrote in her autobiography &quot;Ordeal&quot; (1980) that Traynor was abusive during their marriage and had threatened and coerced her into her role in the pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972).

==Career==
Traynor was a minor figure in the early US East Coast pornographic film industry and appeared in a number of short &quot;loops&quot; in the early 1970s, usually with his then-wife, Linda Lovelace. He was the production manager of the 1972 movie &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

==Relationship with Linda Lovelace==
In a 1980 article in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, &quot;The Real Linda Lovelace&quot;, Gloria Steinem discussed Traynor and Lovelace&#x27;s relationship. Steinem stated that &quot;the myth that Lovelace loved to be sexually used and humiliated was created by her husband&quot; and that he kept her as his prisoner. Lovelace claimed that Traynor forced her into prostitution by threatening her with a gun, repeatedly beat her, forced her to make pornography, and allowed men to rape her repeatedly. Lovelace tried to escape from Traynor three times before she was successful. She said that during &quot;Deep Throat&quot; one can see scars and bruises left on her legs from a beating by Traynor. According to Steinem, Traynor once stated, &quot;When I first dated [Linda] she was so shy, it shocked her to be seen nude by a man... I created Linda Lovelace.&quot;

In a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article on Marilyn Chambers, whom Traynor married after Lovelace divorced him, Traynor said he considered himself a country boy in that he could live away from civilization and that if his woman said something he didn&#x27;t like, he thought nothing of hitting her for it.

Lovelace&#x27;s accusations provoked mixed responses. Traynor admitted to striking Lovelace but said it was part of a voluntary sex game. In Legs McNeil&#x27;s and Jennifer Osborne&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;The Other Hollywood&quot;, several witnesses, including &quot;Deep Throat&quot; director Gerard Damiano, state that Traynor beat Lovelace behind closed doors, but they also question her credibility. Marilyn Chambers said that Lovelace&#x27;s allegations &quot;hurt Chuck&quot;. &quot;Deep Throat, Part 2&quot; actress Andrea True said that most people did not like Chuck Traynor and sided with Lovelace. Lovelace&#x27;s sister, Barbara Boreman, later said in an interview in &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot; that she was disappointed that Traynor died before she could kill him. In the second commentary on the DVD of &quot;Inside Deep Throat,&quot; one member of the production crew of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; also alleged that Traynor beat Lovelace.

Traynor was portrayed by actor Peter Sarsgaard in the 2013 film &quot;Lovelace&quot;.

==Death==
Traynor died at the age of 64 of a heart attack in Chatsworth, California, on July 22, 2002, three months after Lovelace died from massive trauma and internal injuries as a result of a car accident in Colorado.

<text>Bunsen is a lunar impact crater that lies near the northwestern limb of the Moon. It is located to the west of the Oceanus Procellarum and the crater von Braun. To the southeast is the crater Lavoisier, and to the northeast lies Gerard. Northwest of Bunsen, on the far side of the Moon, is McLaughlin. Due to its position this crater appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration.

This crater has become considerably worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving a formation that has been described as disintegrated. The most intact portion of the rim is along the northeastern side. There is a smaller, crater-like formation intruding into the southeastern rim. Within the crater, the floor is pitted by tiny impacts, and has a fracture system of criss-crossing clefts near the northern and southern rims. There is a low ridge near the southwest corner of the interior.

Bunsen was formally named by the IAU in 1964 after Robert W. Bunsen.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bunsen.

An unnamed crater underlying Bunsen A, B, and C was called &quot;Crater 109&quot;.

<text>The  () was a World War II German series of weapons. They were initially developed by and assigned to the Army&#x27;s . Initially, two different mortars were fielded before they were replaced by a variety of rocket launchers ranging in size from . The thin walls of the rockets had the great advantage of allowing much larger quantities of gases, fluids or high explosives to be delivered than artillery or even mortar shells of the same weight. With the exception of the Balkans Campaign, were used in every campaign of the German Army during World War II. A version of the calibre system was adapted for air-to-air use against Allied bombers.

== Name ==
The ″s name, which translates as &quot;fog launcher&quot;, had previously been given to a smoke-generating 35, and was later used for the 10 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 40, which could deliver shells with chemical munitions, as well as high-explosive shells. The same name was then used for later rocket launcher systems. The name did remain in use for both systems, which was possibly not originally intended. The loud, shrill howling noise of the incoming rockets led Allied soldiers in the Sicily campaign to give it the nicknames &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot; and &quot;Moaning Minnie&quot;.

Rudolf Nebel, a German aviator and rocket builder whose last name translates as &quot;fog&quot;, is sometimes incorrectly named as the inventor of the artillery. Nebel did, however, develop a powder-based rocket system with the same name that he used as a fighter pilot during World War I, downing two British planes.

==Weapons==

===10 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 35===

The lower muzzle velocity of a mortar meant that its shell walls could be thinner than those of artillery shells, and it could carry a larger payload than artillery shells of the same weight. This made it an attractive delivery system for poison gases. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service developed their 4.2-inch chemical mortar for precisely that reason and the &quot;Nebeltruppen&quot; shared that reasoning. Its first weapon was also a mortar, the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35, which was designed in 1934.

===10 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 40===

Almost from the beginning, the army wanted more range than the 10 cm NbW 35&#x27;s , but troop trials of two prototypes did not take place until May 1940. Neither was entirely satisfactory, but the best features of both were incorporated into the 10 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 40. This was a very advanced breech-loading weapon with a recoil mechanism and an integral wheeled carriage. It had twice the range of its predecessor, but was eight times the weight and cost nearly ten times as much: vs .

===15 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 41===

Rocket development had begun during the 1920s and reached fruition in the late thirties. This offered the opportunity for the &quot;Nebeltruppen&quot; to deliver large quantities of poison gas or smoke simultaneously. The first weapon to be delivered to the troops was the 15 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 41 in 1940, after the Battle of France, a purpose-designed rocket with gas, smoke and high-explosive warheads. It, like virtually all German rocket designs, was spin-stabilized to increase accuracy. One very unusual feature was that the rocket motor was in the front, the exhaust venturi being about two-thirds down the body from the nose, with the intent to optimize the blast effect of the rocket as the warhead would still be above the ground when it detonated. This proved to greatly complicate manufacture for not much extra effect and it was not copied on later rocket designs. It was fired from a six-tube launcher mounted on a towed carriage adapted from that used by the 3.7 cm PaK 36 and had a range of . Almost five and a half million 15 cm rockets and 6,000 launchers were manufactured over the course of the war.

===28/32 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 41===

The 28/32 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 41 rockets were introduced in 1941, before Operation Barbarossa. They used the same motor, but carried different warheads. The rocket had a HE warhead, while the rockets were incendiary. The maximum range for either rocket was only , a severe tactical drawback. Both could be fired from their wooden packing cases or a special wooden (&quot;schweres Wurfgerät&quot; 40 – heavy missile device) or tubular metal (&quot;schweres Wurfgerät&quot; 41 (sW.G. 41)) frame. Later, a towed launcher was developed that could take six rockets. Both rockets used the same launchers, but special liner rails had to be used for the rockets. A vehicular launch frame, the &quot;schwere&quot; &quot;Wurfrahmen&quot; 40 (sWu.R. 40), was also designed to improve the mobility of the heavy rockets. These were normally mounted on the sides of Sd.Kfz. 251 half-tracks, but they were also adapted for several different captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the &quot;Stuka-zu-Fuß&quot; (&quot;Stuka on Foot&quot;). Over six hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers, excluding the sW.G. and sWu.R. firing frames, were made during the war. In total, 345 launchers were built from 1941.

===21 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 42===
The 21 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 42 rocket, which was introduced in 1942, had a longer range () and a simpler design than the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was only made with high-explosive warheads and was fired from a five-tube launcher that used the same carriage as the smaller weapon. Liner rails were used to allow it to fire the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was also adapted for use by the Luftwaffe to break up Allied bomber formations in 1943 as the &quot;Werfer-Granate&quot; 21. Over four hundred thousand rockets and 1,400 launchers were completed.

===30 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 42===

The last German-designed rocket to be introduced was the 30 cm &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 42 in 1943. This was intended to replace the 28 and 32 cm rockets, which had too short a range. Advances in propellant chemistry also reduced its smoke signature. It could be fired from all of the same platforms as the older rockets and many of the older launchers were converted to be used with the newer rocket by installing adapter rails, although it also had its own purpose-designed launcher, the 30 cm &quot;Raketenwerfer&quot; 56. Fewer than two hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers were built during the war.

===8 cm &quot;Raketen-Vielfachwerfer&quot;===

The Waffen-SS decided to copy the Soviet M-8 &quot;Katyusha&quot; rocket launcher as the 24-rail 8 cm &quot;Raketen-Vielfachwerfer&quot;. Its fin-stabilized rockets were cheaper and easier to manufacture than the German spin-stabilized designs and used cheaper launch rails. It was also capable of using the considerable stocks of captured Soviet rockets. Separate production lines were set up under party control as the army refused to convert any of its existing factories, but not many actually appear to have been made. Production quantities are unknown, but photographic evidence shows the launcher mounted on lightly armored versions of the Sd.Kfz. 4 &quot;&quot;Maultier&quot; and captured French SOMUA MCG half-track.

===Panzerwerfer===

To improve the mobility of the &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; units, a ten-tube launcher was mounted on a lightly armored Sd.Kfz. 4 &quot;Maultier&quot; half-track chassis as the 15 cm &quot;Panzerwerfer&quot; 42 &quot;auf Selbstfahrlafette&quot; Sd.Kfz. 4/1 (based on the Opel &quot;Maultier&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Mule&quot;, half-track). Three hundred of these were produced, split evenly between launchers and ammunition carriers (which were identical except for the launcher). These were superseded in production by the 15 cm &quot;Panzerwerfer&quot; 42 &quot;auf Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper&quot; (&quot;Panzerwerfer auf&quot; SWS), which had improved cross-country mobility and had greater ammunition storage than the &quot;&quot;Maultier&quot;&quot;. The exact number built of the latter weapon is unknown, but evidence suggests that fewer than 100 were completed before the end of the war.

===Air-to-air adaptation (&quot;Werfer-Granate&quot; 21 rocket)===

The &quot;Werfergranate&quot; 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21), also called the 21 cm BR (BR believed to be the abbreviation for &quot;&quot;Bordrakete&quot; in official Luftwaffe manuals) was an unguided air-to-air rocket version of the projectile used in the &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; 42 and was first used in the defense of Schweinfurt on 17 August 1943. The &quot;Wfr. Gr. 21&quot; was mounted on Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters (one launch tube under each wing) and on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Me 410 heavy fighters (two launch tubes under each wing) and was the first air-to-air rocket used by the Luftwaffe. Photographic evidence indicates that the Hungarians fitted three tubes under each wing of some of their twin-engined Me 210 Ca-1 heavy fighters. The rockets were used to break up Allied bomber combat box formations in order to enable more effective German fighter attacks against the scattered Allied aircraft. However, the high drag caused by the launchers reduced the speed and maneuverability of the launching aircraft, a handicap that could prove fatal if Allied fighters were encountered. Also, the launch tube&#x27;s underwing mounting setup, which usually aimed the projectile at about 15° upwards from level flight to counter the considerable ballistic drop of the projectile in flight after launch, added to the drag problem.

One experimental fitment trial program of up to 33 of the rockets, meant to be fired from a single aircraft in an upwards direction (much like the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; upward firing autocannon on German &quot;Nachtjäger&quot; night fighters) was proposed for the Heinkel He 177A as the &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot;, mounted in the central fuselage and flying below American combat box bomber formations to down them, but the quintet of He 177A-5 airframes set aside for the &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot; program only flew as experimental airframes, seeing no active combat deployment.

==Use in combat==
After the crew had loaded and aimed the launcher, they had to take cover away to avoid the exhaust flames, and would fire the rockets with an electric switch. After firing, however, a long streak of smoke was visible from a considerable distance, leaving the &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; vulnerable to counter-battery fire. It was therefore necessary to relocate the launcher and crew as soon as possible after firing.

==Organization==
Generally, mortars of the &quot;Nebeltruppen&quot; were organized into batteries of six or eight mortars, three batteries per battalion. The towed rocket launchers had six launchers per battery, three batteries per battalion. Usually, three battalions formed a regiment. Midway through the war brigades were formed, each with two regiments. A regiment was sometimes reinforced with a &quot;Panzerwerfer&quot; battery of six to eight vehicles. From 1942, their designations changed from &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; to simply &quot;Werfer&quot;&quot;.

As part of its general expansion, the Waffen-SS began to form its own &quot;Werfer&quot; units in 1943, although they never formed any unit larger than a battalion. These were organized much the same as their Army counterparts.

==Organizational history==
The 1st, 2nd and 5th &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; Battalions, each equipped with 24 10 cm Nbw 35 mortars in three batteries, were ready when the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939. The 1st and 2nd Battalions participated in that campaign, while the 5th remained in Western Germany. One battery of Artillery Regiment 222 was converted to 10 cm NbW 35s and participated in the Norwegian Campaign. By May 1940, five more battalions had been formed, all equipped with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars, filling out the sequence from one to eight, but only the first five were combat ready when the Battle of France began on 10 May 1940.

The first 15 cm NbW 41 rocket launchers were delivered in July 1940, forming three new regiments, the 51st, 52nd and 53rd &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; Regiments, each with three battalions. The 54th Regiment was formed from the 1st and 7th &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; Battalions. The &quot;Nebel-Lehr&quot; Regiment was formed from the &quot;Nebeltruppen&quot; school in Celle on 29 April 1941 with two battalions, one each with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars and 15 cm NbW 41 rockets. The independent &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; Battalions retained their mortars with the exception of the 8th, which received rockets before Operation Barbarossa. The only way of differentiating those units equipped with mortars during this period from those with rockets being the &quot;d.&quot; or &quot;do.&quot; suffix added to the designations of the rocket-equipped units. Beginning in November 1941, the eight Decontamination Battalions were fully equipped with 28/32 cm NbW 41 rockets (some had sW.G. 40 and 41 launching frames earlier) and reorganized into three Heavy &quot;Werfer&quot; Regiments.

During early 1942, the 10th Mountain &quot;Werfer&quot; Battalion was formed from the 104th Decontamination Battalion and sent to 20th Mountain Army in Finland. In late 1943, &quot;Werfer&quot;-Battalion 11 was organized from two batteries already in Finland, including the battery from Artillery Regiment 222 that participated in the invasion of Norway. A new &quot;Panzerwerfer&quot; battery was sent from Germany to be its third battery at the same time. Both battalions retreated into Northern Norway after the Finnish armistice in September 1944 after the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive.

The 9th &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; Battalion was given rockets, redesignated as the first battalion of &quot;Werfer&quot;-Regiment 71 and sent to North Africa late that year. Most of the second battalion were sent to Tunisia in early 1943, where it surrendered in May. The remainder of the regiment fought in Sicily and mainland Italy for the rest of the war.

&quot;Panzerwerfer&quot; batteries began to reinforce the &quot;Werfer&quot; Regiments beginning in mid-1943 and the regiments were paired into brigades beginning in early 1944. In late 1944, the brigades were redesignated as &quot;Volks-Werfer&quot; Brigades although no organizational changes occurred. A total of fifteen &quot;Werfer&quot; and &quot;Volks-Werfer&quot; Brigades were formed, plus one Positional &quot;Werfer&quot; Brigade (&quot;Stellungs-Werfer&quot; Brigade) during the war.

<doc id="1165814" wikidata="Q5298252" url="?curid=1165814" title="Dorothea Mitchell">
<text>Dorothea Mitchell (1877–1976), also known as Lady Lumberjack, was a pioneer filmmaker in Canada. Mitchell co-founded the first amateur film group in Canada, the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society, in 1929, and made three feature-length films: &quot;A Race For Ties&quot; (1929), &quot;Sleep Inn Beauty&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Fatal Flower&quot; (1930 but left unfinished). The society&#x27;s first film, &quot;A Race For Ties,&quot; has the distinction of being the first amateur feature length film in Canada.

Mitchell was also the first single woman granted a homestead in the province of Ontario in 1911, served as station master at Silver Mountain Station, and ran a sawmill, which earned her her nickname. She published an autobiography, &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot;, in 1968. &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot; and other works written by Mitchell were republished in an annotated collection in 2005.

== Early life ==
Dorothea Mitchell was born in England in 1877. The family, including her younger sister Vera, moved from England to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, for her father&#x27;s work in establishing railroads throughout the British Empire. Dorothea and Vera were educated as colonial elite in India and were taught etiquette and dancing, as well as other pursuits. Mitchell&#x27;s mother also encouraged her daughters to learn some traditionally masculine skills as well, such as carpentry, riding, and marksmanship. Shortly after the family returned to England in the 1890s, Dorothea&#x27;s father died. The family&#x27;s upper class status in India reverted to middle class in England, and Dorothea began working various jobs to support her mother and younger sister.

== Biography ==
Mitchell emigrated to Canada on her own in 1904 for employment opportunities, first landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She worked various jobs, among them teaching dancing and swimming lessons, while waiting for her mother and sister to join her in Hamilton, Ontario, part of the Greater Toronto Area. When illness delayed her mother and sister&#x27;s arrival to Canada, Mitchell left Hamilton to work for a mining engineer in Silver Mountain, Ontario, in 1909. Although the job&#x27;s tenure was brief due to the economic decline in the silver mining industry, Mitchell remained in the region and began working for the Canadian National Railway (CNR) as a station master, and also operated the general store. Realizing the value of lumber, Mitchell purchased a sawmill and hired workers, earning her nickname of &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot;. The nickname is suitable for Mitchell according to those who knew her; they describe her as proper and ladylike, yet independent and fearless at the same time. For example, when cheated out of $130 in her sawmill business, she single-handedly took the perpetrator to court and won, eventually using the story of a crooked timber dealer as inspiration when writing her first film, &quot;A Race For Ties&quot;.

Unmarried women were not ordinarily entitled to a free grant, but Mitchell was granted homestead in 1907, although she was permitted only 79 acres, less than half of what men were typically given. She was the first single woman granted homestead in the province of Ontario. Mitchell lived in a bungalow on the property with her mother and sister, who had finally arrived to Canada from England.

Mitchell remained spirited and determined in her various interests throughout her life. In her autobiography, she recounts her foray into photography, stating &quot;After I traded an old cook stove for a camera, I became renowned for my photography instead of my dresses.&quot; Her interest in film, as well as various other endeavours including writing, assisted her later in her filmmaking.

== Film career ==
Mitchell moved to Port Arthur, Ontario (now part of Thunder Bay) in 1921, joining her mother and sister, who had moved there the previous year. Again, Mitchell worked various jobs such as teacher and accountant, through which she met Fred Cooper, a local bakery owner. Mitchell&#x27;s local reputation as a proficient photographer and ardent writer (involved in local newspapers and theatres) made her a perfect partner for the aspiring filmmaker Cooper, and together they co-founded the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society (PAACS) in February 1929. The society has the distinction of being the first amateur film group in Canada, and their first film, &quot;A Race For Ties&quot;, is the first Canadian feature-length film by non-professionals.

===&quot;A Race For Ties&quot; (1929)===
Mitchell put her varied experiences to use, serving as actor, production manager, editor, casting director, and writer for &quot;A Race For Ties&quot;. As writer, Mitchell was inspired by her own experiences, telling a story of a small sawmill owner competing against a large timber company to win a railway tie contract. In her autobiography, &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot;, Mitchell recounts her involvement with the Cinema Society, stating &quot;[&quot;A Race For Ties&quot;] was based on a timber deal I had myself experienced in the adjacent bush country, but of course making a young girl the heroine. As the author, I was privileged to choose the cast, and, with the Photographer and Director, became a charter member of the Amateur Cinema Society of Thunder Bay.&quot;

The film debuted at Thunder Bay&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre in May 1929. The three-night event was incredibly popular. Some four hundred people had to be turned away because maximum capacity had been reached. Mitchell recalls the event as &quot;a truly posh affair. Expressions of opinion were quite complimentary, perhaps the most extravagant coming from the manager of our biggest local movie house, the Colonial. He said our effort was definitely ahead of many of the early professional productions.&quot; The PAACS also showed their newsreel at the event. Although films in the 1920s were usually accompanied by introductory newsreels, the PAACS newsreel was the first to include the news of local Northwestern Ontario events, as well as national and international events.

===&quot;Sleep Inn Beauty&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Fatal Flower&quot; (1930)===
The PAACS&#x27;s second feature-length film, &quot;Sleep Inn Beauty&quot;, was again produced, cast, and written by Mitchell, who adapted the scenario from a short story. In her autobiography, she recounts how the success of the first two films encouraged the PAACS to expand, renting an office and more equipment. However, in 1931 the Society was forced to close due to dwindling interest from members and accumulated bank debt from the filming of the uncompleted &quot;The Fatal Flower&quot;. The onset of the Great Depression, as well as the introduction of sound film to cinema, also contributed to the Society&#x27;s closure.

===The Fatal Flower Project (2004)===
In 2004, a small group of film historians, filmmakers, writers, and artists in Thunder Bay endeavoured to finish Mitchell&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Fatal Flower&quot;. Led by local filmmaker Kelly Saxberg, the members of &quot;The Fatal Flower Project&quot; became familiar with Mitchell through archival footage, as well as her autobiography and previous films, and proceeded to finish the silent film, editing the raw footage and adding a plot, inter-title cards, and accompanying music. The film previewed at Thunder Bay&#x27;s historic Finnish Labour Temple.

== Later life ==
In 1930, Mitchell became the first secretary-treasurer for the new Port Arthur General Hospital. After the closure of the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society in 1931, Mitchell&#x27;s mother and sister died and Mitchell, although no longer having to support her dependents, took over a real estate and accounting business in Port Arthur. Mitchell was also involved in St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church and the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire in Port Arthur. In 1939, at the age of 63, Mitchell enlisted in the Red Cross Society and worked in the transportation corps and the office of Voluntary Registration of Canadian women at the onset of World War II. She continued working for the military, helping the dependents of servicemen as well as aiding British orphans until she retired to the West Coast in 1941, settling down in Victoria, British Columbia. In Victoria, she became involved once again in amateur filmmaking, joining the Victoria Amateur Movie Club, as well as joining the Victoria Branch of the Canadian Authors Association as secretary. In 1968, at the age of 91, Mitchell published a book of autobiographical short stories, entitled &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot;. Mitchell died in Victoria in 1976, at the age of 99.

== Legacy ==
The Silver Mountain and Area Historical Society is working towards designating a portion of Highway 593 as the Dorothea Mitchell Memorial Highway.

In her review of &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot;, the annotated collection of works edited by Michel S. Beaulieu and Ronald N. Harpelle, Cheryl Desroches states of Mitchell: &quot;If she found living in the woods at times inconvenient, she would have laughed at the thought of herself as soft. &quot;Lady Lumberjack&quot; is laden with evidence of Mitchell&#x27;s ability to defy notions, typical of the era, of appropriate female behaviour. [...] Mitchell&#x27;s experiences fostered a strong belief that women were capable of anything men could do.&quot; The anthology &quot;provide[s] a much-needed first-hand female perspective of the pioneer experience. Because she wrote about her extraordinary life in such matter-of-fact terms, however, her contributions to the feminist movement (and to literature more generally) has been overlooked in the broader historical record.&quot; Desroches praises Beaulieu and Harpelle&#x27;s efforts to include Mitchell with the likes of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill as an early advocate of women&#x27;s rights.

<text>Palm Beach Atlantic University (PBA) is a private nondenominational Christian university in West Palm Beach, Florida. PBA&#x27;s nine colleges focus on the liberal arts with a select collection of professional studies. In 2024, PBA&#x27;s undergraduate enrollment was approximately 2,600.

Founded in 1968, PBA grew out of a local Baptist church. PBA is now a nondenominational institution. PBA operated out of assorted buildings until the first purpose-built PBA campus building was completed in 1982. A subsidiary PBA campus operates in Orlando. Eighteen sports teams represent PBA in NCAA Division II competitions.

== History ==
PBA was the vision of and was founded by Jess C. Moody in 1968 while he was the pastor of First Baptist Church of West Palm Beach. He served at PBA until the first PBA class graduated in 1972 and resigned as PBA president to focus on his duties at First Baptist Church. Two laymen of the church, Donald Warren and Riley Sims, became involved as trustees before PBA began and continued to contribute time and support at PBA for many years. Warren served as chairman of the trustees at PBA for 38 years until 2007. 

In July 1972, Warner E. Fusselle, previously president of Truett-McConnell College, became PBA&#x27;s second president and led the accreditation process at PBA with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which PBA achieved in December 1972.

George Borders, Vice President of Student Affairs at Stetson University, became the third president of PBA in 1978. He was popular with PBA students and the Florida Baptist Convention. After his resignation from PBA in 1981 to become the president of the Florida Baptist Foundation, Claude H. Rhea became president of PBA. During his presidency at PBA, the university developed the Rinker campus—PBA&#x27;s flagship location in West Palm Beach—and expanded academic programs at PBA.

Paul R. Corts, previously president of Wingate College, was the fifth president of PBA. He presided over the addition of two graduate programs at PBA, from 1991 until 2002. He resigned from PBA in 2002 to accept a position as Assistant Attorney General for Administration with the United States Department of Justice.

David W. Clark, President of FamilyNet, cable TV network, and founding provost of Regent University became the sixth PBA president in 2003. During his presidency enrollment at PBA grew from 2,600 to 3,291. Five new buildings were completed at PBA, including the Warren Library and a mini PBA campus in Wellington. Meanwhile, for a new PBA athletic campus were acquired. PBA&#x27;s budget grew from $43 million to $73 million. Over 4,600 or 40 percent of all degrees at PBA were awarded during his tenure at PBA. President Clark announced his retirement from PBA during the 2008–2009 academic year at the end of June. He later served as interim president of Vanguard University. 

On July 1, 2009, Lu Hardin took office as the seventh president of PBA. A former Arkansas state senator, Hardin had previously served as the president of the University of Central Arkansas. Hardin resigned the presidency of PBA on March 4, 2011, shortly before pleading guilty in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, to two federal felony charges (wire fraud and money laundering) which occurred during his tenure at UCA.

On March 10, 2011, William M. B. &quot;Bill&quot; Fleming, Jr., PBA&#x27;s vice president for development, was named interim PBA president by the university&#x27;s board of trustees. After a nationwide search, Fleming, who had served as interim president at PBA for more than a year, was elected by the trustees as PBA&#x27;s eighth president, beginning his presidency at PBA on May 8, 2012.

On January 16, 2020, Dr. Debra Schwinn was announced as the new president of PBA, following Fleming&#x27;s retirement. Schwinn took office at PBA on May 4, 2020. She was PBA&#x27;s first woman president. PBA was one of the few universities in the United States to fully operate in person during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Under Dr. Schwinn&#x27;s leadership one of the PBA dorms, Watson Hall, was used in part for quarantine dorms. A team of health alert nurses at PBA would text any COVID-positive students to stay home, then commence contact tracing. While only a few PBA students needed to be quarantined, PBA ensured their meals were delivered and that a buddy system was in place. PBA students also could spend 30 minutes each night on a special Zoom meeting with Dr. Schwinn and other quarantined PBA students.

== Campus == 
PBA&#x27;s campus is located in West Palm Beach. The first structure built specifically for PBA, the W.G. Lassiter Jr. Student Center, was completed in 1982. This was followed by PBA&#x27;s Johnson Hall and Sachs Hall in 1989. A new PBA campus was established in Orlando in 2002 and in Wellington in 2002. PBA&#x27;s Wellington campus ceased operations in 2017.

PBA residence halls include Baxter Hall, Coastal Towers Apartments, Johnson Hall, Oceanview Hall, Pembroke Hall, Rinker Hall, Watson Hall, and Weyenberg Hall.

Classroom buildings at PBA include the Vera Lea Rinker Hall, the Lloyd L. Gregory School of Pharmacy, Borbe Hall, MacArthur Hall, Rinker Hall, Oceanview Hall, The Greene Complex for Sports and Recreation, Memorial Presbyterian Church, Fern Street Theatre, Holy Trinity Church, and Okeechobee Hall. In 2022, PBA launched its God-Sized Dreams campaign, a capital plan to expand academic programs and innovative spaces on PBA&#x27;s West Palm Beach campus. In January 2024, PBA broke ground on the Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker Business Hall, the first of four major projects to occur under PBA&#x27;s God-Sized Dreams campaign.

A permanent home for PBA Athletics is in the form of a 78-acre Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker Athletic Campus at 3401 Parker Avenue in West Palm Beach—just a short drive from PBA. The campus, located between I-95 and Parker Avenue just north of Southern Boulevard, provides PBA facilities for training and hosting intercollegiate and intramural and club sport competitions. The PBA facility opened in September 2014 and was completed in August 2017.
== Growth ==
Over the past several years, PBA has experienced unprecedented growth on its West Palm Beach campus. In 2024, PBA celebrated its third consecutive year of record-breaking enrollment. Now, PBA has over 4,100 students, with more than 80 countries represented. PBA contributed more than $435.6 million in economic impact to Palm Beach County in 2023-2024. 

In June 2024, PBA was ranked third in the nation for application growth compared to pre-COVID levels, according to an analysis by Numerade using National Center for Education Statistics data. 

This growth at PBA, coupled with the economic boom that South Florida has experienced in recent years, positions PBA to respond to market changes, expand academic programs at PBA, and build new, innovative spaces through PBA&#x27;s God-Sized Dreams campaign. Under the expansion plan, PBA will undertake four key projects. In January 2024, PBA broke ground on the first: the Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker Business Hall, after a historic donation from a longtime PBA supporter inspired the launch of the campaign at PBA. The university will also build a world-class performing arts center, a welcome center, and a new health sciences complex at PBA. 

== Academics ==

PBA offers more than 100 undergraduate and graduate programs through nine schools:

*Rinker School of Business
*School of Liberal Arts and Sciences
*School of Health Professions
*School of Education and Behavioral Studies
*Catherine T. MacArthur School of Leadership
*School of Ministry
*College of the Arts

*Gregory School of Pharmacy

The university also offers seven centers of excellence that complement PBA&#x27;s academic programs: 
*Center for Financial Literacy
*Center for Global Leadership
*Center for Integrative Science Learning
*Gregory Center for Medical Missions
*LeMieux Center for Public Policy
*Rinker Center for Experiential Learning
*Titus Center for Franchising

=== Academic freedom ===
In 2023, PBA English professor Samuel Joeckel was fired from PBA following allegations from a parent that he was &quot;indoctrinating&quot; PBA students by including racial justice texts in a composition class at PBA. Joeckel said that he had a racial justice unit at PBA for the last 12 years of his 20 years teaching at PBA, and that students were instructed to come to their own stance and conclusions. He filed a discrimination complaint with EEOC with hopes to establish adequate academic freedom for PBA faculty. 

PBA does not offer professors tenure.

PBA&#x27;s diversity statement, which was adopted by the PBA board of trustees in April 2021, says that &quot;no form of racism, racial supremacy, ableism, or ethnic bigotry will be tolerated at [PBA].&quot;

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) investigated Joeckel&#x27;s situation. In a letter to PBA president Debra Schwinn, AAUP Senior Program Officer Michael DeCesare wrote that Joeckel &quot;was abruptly terminated prior to the end of (PBA&#x27;s) term after complaints were made regarding his teaching a unit on racial justice... We hope you appreciate that if allegations against faculty members were commonly handled in this manner at Palm Beach Atlantic University, academic freedom and due process would have little meaning.&quot;

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) issued a faculty letter condemning PBA&#x27;s decision and supporting Joeckel. The letter stated, &quot;We are deeply concerned about the state of academic freedom at Palm Beach Atlantic University after PBA fired English professor Samuel Joeckel because material in the racial justice unit of his composition course was deemed to be &#x27;indoctrinating students.&#x27;&quot; The letter continues, &quot;We join FIRE in condemning Palm Beach Atlantic’s choice not to renew Joeckel’s contract, a decision which violated Joeckel’s rights and casts an impermissible chilling effect over other professors who may fear that teaching controversial material could jeopardize their jobs. We urge Palm Beach Atlantic to reaffirm its commitment to academic freedom and to pledge that it will refrain from retaliation against professors for their protected expression.&quot; This letter was signed by sixty-six professors from around the United States.

Like the AAUP, FIRE wrote a letter to PBA and &quot;urged the university to reaffirm its commitment to academic freedom and renew professor Joeckel’s contract.&quot; PBA never responded to this letter.

In 2024, the civil dispute between Joeckel and PBA was settled out of court.

== Ministry life ==
Chapel is held at PBA four times weekly in the DeSantis Family Chapel, Monday through Thursday at 11 a.m., as well as other times, dates and locations that are listed on PBA&#x27;s chapel calendar. 
Chapel is a requirement for all full-time undergrad students. PBA students must attend 24 chapels per year.
&quot;Workship&quot; is PBA&#x27;s community service program that seeks to respond to human needs with Christ-like action in the community and throughout the world, with the intention that such community service might help PBA students discern their vocation and develop a lifelong habit of servant leadership. Since it was established at PBA in 1968, PBA&#x27;s Workship program has partnered with over 200 organizations in Palm Beach County. In spring 2024, PBA celebrated 4 million hours of Workship, a major milestone in PBA&#x27;s history. 

PBA mission trips are offered yearly for PBA students. PBA mission teams travel to countries all over the world and minister through evangelism, performing arts, street ministries, construction, medical outreach, sports workshops and more. The PBA teams travel during the summer on a multi-week trip and on a one-week spring break trip.

== Athletics ==
The PBA athletic teams are called the Sailfish. PBA&#x27;s colors are navy blue and white. PBA is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Sunshine State Conference (SSC) since the 2015–2016 academic year as a provisional member for most their sports (achieving D-II full member status in 2016–2017); while PBA&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field teams compete as NCAA D-II Independents as the conference does not sponsor these sports. The PBA Sailfish previously competed as an NCAA D-II Independent from 2003–2004 to 2014–2015; and in the Florida Sun Conference (FSC; now currently known as the Sun Conference since the 2008–2009 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1990–1991 to 2002–2003.

PBA competes in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: PBA men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while PBA women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

=== PBA Facilities ===
PBA&#x27;s Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker Athletic Campus has beach volleyball, soccer, lacrosse, baseball, softball, tennis, and running trails as well as a new state of the art weight and training rooms. PBA&#x27;s building houses locker rooms and meeting rooms as well as PBA Athletics offices.

=== PBA Mascot ===
The sailfish is a predatory billfish, distinguished by its prominent dorsal fin and ability to accelerate to speeds unmatched by any other fish, up to 68 mph. The sailfish can achieve these speeds and jumping heights as it leaps from the ocean, as one of the fiercest marine predators. When PBA was founded in 1968, PBA founders looked to nautical themes for PBA&#x27;s varsity athletic teams. The powerful sailfish is reflected in PBA&#x27;s current athletics logo. The sailfish’s speed, power, and prominence along Florida’s Atlantic coast made it a natural choice for PBA&#x27;s mascot. To date, PBA remains the only university in United States to use the sailfish as its mascot.

<text>Steady Diet of Nothing is the second studio album by American post-hardcore band Fugazi, released in July 1991 by Dischord Records. Although a persistent rumor alleges that the title is an allusion to a quote by the late American stand-up comedian Bill Hicks, the album title predates the Hicks quote by several years and was actually thought up by bassist Joe Lally.

Although well received and popular at the time of its release, &quot;Steady Diet&quot; is often overlooked by many music journalists when writing about Fugazi&#x27;s career, but remains a favorite among fans of the band.

==Recording==
&quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot; was recorded during January and February 1991 at Inner Ear Studios and is notable for being the group&#x27;s first self-produced release. As a result of not having an outside producer besides engineer Don Zientara, the album&#x27;s recording and mixing sessions were tough on the band. Guy Picciotto said of making the record, &quot;[it] was a tough record for us to make. It was our first attempt at producing and mixing by ourselves, and we didn’t feel like we had a really good handle, technically, on what we wanted to do. And we were also pretty fried from a shitload of back-to-back touring. I appreciate Steady Diet for a lot of things, but there was a flatness to both the performances and the sound that was weird to us.&quot; Singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye explained, &quot;It was like we were walking on eggshells, trying not to offend each other. No one would say, &quot;Turn your guitar down,&quot; or, &quot;Turn the drums down.&quot; So we ended up getting a democratic mix, and a lot of times democratic mixes equal bad mixes. And I feel &quot;Steady Diet&quot; is a classic example of us being very conservative, although a lot of people think it&#x27;s our best record.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, the album is far more sparse than the band&#x27;s other works, with the conservative, dry production serving to highlight the rhythm section of bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty. &quot;Although you could probably trace their influences to numerous sources,&quot; wrote Steve Park of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Fugazi&#x27;s music is about the natural fusion of two genres: hardcore and reggae. But unlike Bad Brains, they blend genres into a true hybrid rather than two easily distinguishable parts.&quot; The band&#x27;s entry in &quot;Trouser Press&quot; writes that the album &quot;sets up a dichotomy between razorblade ferocity and methodical determination; pulling firmly with one hand and jabbing angrily with the other, Fugazi opens the door to a world of mixed emotions and conflicting impulses. The pressure instilled by the band’s ability to hold itself to an economical beat and escaping shards of tense guitar is barely relieved by the stormy whorls of flat-out aggression into which they typically feed. (The instrumental “Steady Diet” whips the latter into a dangerous froth.)&quot; It also notes the band&#x27;s guitar sound (&quot;a loose-stringed jangle like an electrified fence being plucked&quot;) and the &quot;urgent&quot; vocals of MacKaye and Picciotto. The guitar tone on &quot;Long Division&quot; has been described as being &quot;so dry, they could have been recorded direct.&quot; &quot;Latin Roots&quot; recalled the band&#x27;s earlier dub-influenced stylings, with Canty laying down a Stewart Copeland-influenced drum beat.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; praised the band&#x27;s avoidance of &quot;obvious&quot; lyrical themes for the most part, noting that: &quot;Unlike most punk anthems, the haiku-like lyrics of “Exit Only” will probably still convey the same meaning 20 years from now.&quot; A retrospective write-up on the album by &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Cosmo Lee similarly writes that: &quot;Unlike, say, Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name,&quot; a closed system of slogans, &quot;Steady Diet&quot; leaves space for interpretation, sonically, lyrically, and visually (the figure on the cover will forever remain inscrutable). In this way, it&#x27;s Fugazi at their best: ditching the easy answers of Minor Threat, and asking hard questions.&quot; The song &quot;Long Division&quot;, for example, &quot;examines the slow, no-fault disintegration of a friendship&quot; whereas &quot;Latin Roots&quot; - a song about a &quot;sexual encounter&quot; - sees Picciotto coming to terms with his own Italian ancestry. (AllMusic&#x27;s Andy Kellman additionally notes that his idiosyncratic vocals on the song result in many of the lyrics being commonly misheard.) The song &quot;Runaway Return&quot; even &quot;recasts the age-old prodigal son story in a modern context.&quot; However, much of &quot;Steady Diet&quot;&#x27;s lyrics are still political, with Guy Picciotto recalling that the band at the time were affected negatively by the then-ongoing Gulf War: “I think we all started to feel that America was just becoming a madhouse, [...] and it depressed us a lot.” An anti-war theme was noted in the lyrics to &quot;Nice New Outfit&quot; in addition to the band&#x27;s usual anti-consumerist stance. &quot;Dear Justice Letter&quot; was inspired by Supreme Court liberal stalwart William J. Brennan, who had recently retired. The band addressed the subject of personal freedom on the pro-choice anthem &quot;Reclamation&quot; and &quot;KYEO&quot; (&quot;keep your eyes open&quot;) was dedicated by MacKaye to Rodney King during the &#x27;Steady Diet&#x27; tour.

==Release==

Six months before the release, Dischord had pre-orders of over 160,000 for the album. In August 1993, more than two years after the album&#x27;s release, MacKaye told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that &quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot; had sold 215,000 units. Both MacKaye and Picciotto would later attribute the album&#x27;s relatively-mild response to the alternative rock boom heralded by the release of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; two months after &quot;Steady Diet&quot;. According to Picciotto (who was on tour with the band in Australia at the time): “It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had, [...] &quot;Nevermind&quot; was so huge, and people were so fucking blown away. We were just like, ‘What the fuck is going on here?’ It was so crazy. On one hand, the shows were bigger, but on the other hand, it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did.” Despite this, &quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the UK, where it peaked at #63.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot; received mostly positive reviews upon release. Steve Park of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; wrote that the band pulled off &quot;a double triumph by mixing music and politics without diluting the entertainment and adrenaline.&quot; He noted, however, that the album failed to capture the &quot;immediate intensity&quot; of their live performances. Andy Kellman wrote that while the album was &quot;not nearly as neck-gnawing as Repeater, Steady Diet still packs a sizable wallop, but with slower tempos and less deliberate instrumentation.&quot; He took issue, however, with the vagueness of the lyrics which &quot;border[s] on equivocality at times -- which has its advantages and disadvantages.&quot;

A mixed review came from Robert Christgau, who simply awarded the album a &quot;Neither&quot; score, indicating a release that &quot;may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Lost At Sea&quot; ranked it the 84th greatest album of the nineties. Gavin Rossdale of Bush included &quot;Steady Diet&quot; among the 10 albums that changed his life. Both Suuns and Buke and Gase covered the track &quot;Long Division&quot; live. The 2021 Fugazi tribute album &quot;Silence Is a Dangerous Sound: A Tribute to Fugazi&quot; - featuring bands such as La Dispute, Failure, Shai Hulud, Big Ups, Zao and 38 others - takes its name from a lyric in &quot;KYEO&quot;.

<doc id="1165827" wikidata="Q5124499" url="?curid=1165827" title="Civil Liberties Act of 1988">
<text>The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (, title I, August 10, 1988, , et seq.) is a United States federal law that granted reparations to Japanese Americans who had been wrongly interned by the United States government during World War II and to &quot;discourage the occurrence of similar injustices and violations of civil liberties in the future&quot;. The act was sponsored by California Democratic congressman and former internee Norman Mineta in the House and Hawaii Democratic Senator Spark Matsunaga in the Senate. The bill was supported by the majority of Democrats in Congress, while the majority of Republicans voted against it. The act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.

The act granted each surviving internee $20,000 in compensation, equivalent to $ in , with payments beginning in 1990. The legislation stated that government actions had been based on &quot;race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership&quot; as opposed to legitimate security reasons. A total of 82,219 received redress checks.

Because the law was restricted to American citizens and legal permanent residents, ethnic Japanese who had been taken from their homes in Latin America (mostly from Peru) were not granted reparations, regardless of whether they had remained in the United States, had returned to Latin America or had been deported to Japan after the war. In 1996, Carmen Mochizuki filed a class-action lawsuit and won a settlement of approximately $5,000 per eligible person. Of those affected, 145 received their settlement before funds were exhausted. In 1999, funds were approved for the Attorney General to pay compensation to the remaining claimants.

==Background==
===Internment of Japanese Americans===

The internment of Japanese Americans was the forced removal and confinement of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans (62% of whom were United States citizens) from the West Coast of the United States during World War II. Some 5,500 Japanese American men arrested by the FBI immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor were sent directly to internment camps run by the Department of Justice, and approximately 5,000 were able to &quot;voluntarily&quot; relocate to other parts of the country before forced evacuations began. The remainder – over 110,000 men, women and children – were sent to &quot;relocation centers&quot;, hastily constructed camps in remote portions of the nation&#x27;s interior run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA).

President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the internment with Executive Order 9066, which allowed local military commanders to designate &quot;military areas&quot; from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the continental Pacific coast region, including all of Alaska and California, and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government custody. In 1944, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion, removal, and detention, arguing that it is permissible to curtail the civil rights of a racial group when there is a &quot;pressing public necessity.&quot;

===Redress and reparations===

Some compensation for property losses was paid in 1948, but most internees were unable to fully recover their losses. In the 1960s and 1970s, a renewed movement formed within the Japanese American community to obtain redress for the wartime incarceration. The Japanese American Citizens League introduced a resolution to seek individual reparations at its 1970 conference and soon after began working with community activists and political leaders to lobby for legislative action. In 1979, the National Council for Japanese American Redress filed a class-action lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of former camp inmates, and in 1980, after a push from senator Daniel Inouye and congressmen Robert Matsui, Spark Matsunaga and Norman Mineta, Congress appointed a committee to study the effects of the incarceration and the potential for redress. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians held investigative hearings in 11 U.S. cities, at which more than 750 people provided testimony of their experiences during and after the war. In 1983, the commission published its findings in the report &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot;, writing that the displacement of Japanese Americans during the war had been the result of &quot;race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership&quot; and recommending monetary reparations be made to former internees. Although the bill to issue a formal apology and implement the CWRIC&#x27;s recommendations, introduced in 1987, faced heavy resistance from President Reagan and Senate Republicans opposed to increased federal spending, it was signed into law on August 10, 1988.

On October 9, 1990, a ceremony was held to present the first reparations checks. Nine elderly Issei received $20,000 each and a formal apology signed by President George H. W. Bush. United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh presented the checks to the attendees, dropping to his knees to reach those in wheelchairs.

Payments to surviving internees or their heirs continued until 1993, overseen by the Office of Redress Administration, one of two government agencies created to carry out the 1988 act&#x27;s implementation. The other, the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund, was established in order to meet the redress bill&#x27;s provision to educate the public about the incarceration. $50 million was authorized &quot;to sponsor research and public educational activities&quot; in 1988, but anti-spending lobbying put the education program on hold until 1994 and reduced the final amount to $5 million. President Bill Clinton appointed an advisory board in 1996, and the CLPEF was used to fund various educational programs and grants from 1997 to 1998.

==Civil Liberties Act of 1988==
The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, &quot;Restitution for World War II internment of Japanese-Americans and Aleuts&quot;, states that it is intended to:

==Congressional support and opposition==
On September 17, 1987, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill (which symbolically shared its number with that of the 442nd Infantry Regiment) by a vote of 243 to 141, with 38 members not voting. The majority of Democrats in the House voted for the bill (180 in favor vs. 43 opposed) while a majority of Republicans voted against it (63 in favor vs. 98 opposed).
On April 20, 1988, the U.S. Senate passed the bill by a vote of 69 to 27, with 4 members not voting. A large majority of Democrats voted for the bill (44 in favor vs. 7 opposed), while a more narrow majority of Senate Republicans also voted for the bill (25 in favor vs. 20 opposed).

<text>Burgum is the largest and administrative town of the municipality of Tytsjerksteradiel, in the Dutch province of Friesland. It had a population of 10,058 inhabitants in January 2017.

On 1 January 1989 the official name of the village was changed from &quot;Bergum&quot; to &quot;Burgum.&quot; This was done to match the Frisian name of the village. Bergum is the current name in Dutch.

The name Burgum is suggestive of an area of higher altitude than the surrounding area. The province of Friesland is bordered in the north by the Wadden Sea. In ancient and medieval times, habitation in Friesland occurred only in those areas which were elevated above sea level (for example in Burgum) or on artificially built mounds known as terp, weird or ward. These mounds were areas of refuge in times of flooding. The artificial mounds became redundant after the building of the dykes on the border of the Wadden Sea. Habitation of this area goes back to the Stone Age.

Main things to see in Burgum are the Town Hall and the &quot;Krústsjerke&quot; (Cross Church) which is the remainder of a convent burned in the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Friesland is renowned for its many lakes and canals. One of these lakes is found nearby the village of Burgum and it is called the Burgumer Mar. Another object of interest is the so-called Poppestien. A large stone deposited in this area during the last ice age (11,000 BC). In ancient times this stone was used in fertility rituals.

== Notable buildings ==
* Protestant church of Burgum
* The Municipality center of Tytsjerksteradiel

== Notable people associated with Burgum ==
* Hendrik Bulthuis - Amateur boat builder and designer of the Bergumermeer-class sailing-boat (“B.M.-er”)
* Tsjibbe Gearts van der Meulen - Frisian writer and poet
* Joke van Rijssel, long track speed skater
* Rombertus van Uylenburgh - One of the founders of the University of Franeker

<text>Amherst Island is located in Lake Ontario, west of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Amherst Island, being wholly in Lake Ontario, is upstream, above the St Lawrence River Thousand Islands. The island is part of Loyalist Township in Lennox and Addington County. Amherst Island is located about offshore from the rest of Loyalist Township and is serviced by public ferry from Millhaven. The Island measures over in length from Bluff Point in the southwest to Amherst Bar in the northeast and over at its widest point across. The island is about in size and is one of the largest islands in the Great Lakes.

The Amherst Island archipelago also includes: Nut Island, Grape Island &quot;pronounced&quot; Grapee, the Brother Islands and Salmon Island, totalling over or about . Nut Island is the largest of these islands and is about off the Amherst Island shore between Amherst Bay and Long Point Bay. Grape Island is located about off the Amherst Island shore, and can be easily seen from shore. The Brother Islands are situated equidistant between Amherst Island, Amherstview and Lemoine Point, Kingston, Ontario.

==History==
Amherst Island had been frequented, inhabited seasonally by Indigenous peoples who named it, Ka8enesgo translated as &quot;big, long island&quot;. Amherst Island was known by the French as Isle Tonti, after Henri de Tonty, Lieutenant to La Salle during their explorations. Loyalist-era settlement had started by 1792 and the Island was thickly settled by 1835. In a proclamation by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe on 16 July 1792, the Island was formally renamed to Amherst Island, in honour of Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, who was commander-in-chief of British forces in North America. Simcoe was renaming the archipelago to commemorate British Generals of the Seven Years&#x27; War: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, and Howe Island.

In 1788, the island was granted by the Executive Council to one of their own Sir John Johnson, who had lost his father&#x27;s extensive New York Colony possessions to the revolting colonies. In 1823, Sir John&#x27;s widowed daughter, Catharine Maria Bowes, gained control of the island estate from her disinterested father. She sold numerous conversions of life-leases to freehold ownership to avoid the looming Wild Land Tax, 1824. By 1827 Mrs. Bowes was still in financial difficulty and granted a power of attorney to the Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell, who purchased the balance of the Island Estate outright from her in 1835. Individual freeholders already &quot;owned&quot; and farmed nearly 4,000 acres, approximately one quarter of the Island, predominantly, but not restricted to, the First Concession.

Mount Cashell&#x27;s interest in Amherst Island was both profit-oriented and &quot;initially&quot; humanitarian. He aspired to establish a feudal estate, and reap large returns on his investment by the settlement of the Island with industrious tenants who would continue to clear and cultivate the land, thereby improving its value and providing &quot;his heirs&quot; with a &quot;perpetual&quot; rental income. But his vision initially, extended beyond pecuniary ends. Inspired by the evangelical belief in human improvement, he thought that by encouraging emigration from Ireland to Canada he could help solve the overpopulation of his homeland, create a prosperous, loyal farming population in the new world, and strengthen the Empire through a transatlantic grain trade. Mount Cashell became a leading spokesman of these views in North America.

Most of the Irish settlers had been small farmers, labourers, sailors, artisans, and the better-off class of labourers from Ards Peninsula Ards, County Down (importantly property not owned by Mount Cashell). Since their homeland was particularly exposed to coastal winds and the absence of water-power, their built environment had been dotted with windmills.

Mount Cashell issued the settlers seven-year leases at a nominal rent and requiring them to make certain improvements each year. He erected two piers, to secure and make serviceable two excellent natural harbours; he introduced a clergyman for St James&#x27; Anglican Church, for whom he provided a glebe house; he sent out a surgeon, for whom also he built a house; he built a house for an active agent; he built and furnished an excellent general store and a forge. Families from the Ards had begun arriving by the 1820s. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s their numbers swelled as friends and relatives continued to arrive – chain migration. But by the 1860s the movement had subsided. Settlers who arrived in the early years moved straight into leases while those arriving after 1850 often laboured for friends before renting existing leases. By 1841, the community had three schools and a population of over 1,000 people. The majority of families were Presbyterian, followed by Roman Catholics, Church of England, and recent Methodist converts. These Irish immigrants lived in either shanties or one-storey log houses on their leased land, and never achieved purchasing farms from departing, pre-Mount Cashell freeholders.
It is impossible to imagine the social dichotomy on the Island during Mount Cashell&#x27;s management: individual freeholders, the minority, who could conduct long term, personal strategies &quot;versus&quot; the majority, tenants with no prospects of ever owning their farm, who could neither commit resources nor time to beyond next year. The freeholders owned wood cookstoves in their &quot;improved houses,&quot; while the tenants cooked on open hearths in their temporary abodes.

While Amherst Islanders had prospered from the grain trade into the 1840s, the soil was depleted, the Hessian Fly agricultural pest had arrived and the Huron Tract beckoned; dozens of tenant families departed to the prospect of &quot;owning&quot; land on the distant frontier. Their landlord fell upon hard times. The famine in Ireland hurt Mount Cashell badly. Distressed Irish tenants and declining rents placed a heavy burden on a landlord who was already in debt because of lavish living and beleaguered by an untrustworthy agent&#x27;s embezzlement. In 1848, he mortgaged Amherst Island. Several more mortgages followed on his Canadian properties, and in 1856 his creditors foreclosed and Amherst Island was sold at public auction to creditor/ kin Robert Perceval Maxwell (1813–1905). Some of the current residents of the Island are descendants of those Irish settlers.

Amherst Island at mid-19th century was a mixed economy of farming wheat and barley, fishing in the Bay of Quinte, sailing the Great Lakes, and shipbuilding at the local yard of David Tait. Soon, however, the shipyard relocated west to Prince Edward County; sailing declined as railways supplanted the previous monopoly of water transport; and crop farming gave way to more stable, mixed dairy farming. As the economy changed those who could not make the transition left, while those who remained imagined purchasing their lease-hold and expanding their farms.

In all this, Robert Perceval Maxwell and his agent were the primary financiers, establishing the agricultural society and a cheese factory, promoting improvements, and financing loans and mortgages. Throughout these years, the Ards emigrants did very well. Many became proprietors, they held prominent positions in the community, and the Island became well known for its &#x27;Irishness&#x27;. John Watson, from Portaferry, called his pub on the Island the &#x27;County Down Inn&#x27;. The stone fences that lined the land were modelled after those on the Ards.

1870s: The remaining tenants had the opportunity to buy their farms and transition out of their log residences, and build &quot;improved houses.&quot; Thereby the island most likely slipped from carbon neutrality to importing Coal &quot;circa&quot; 1880: the resident agent&#x27;s country manor house &quot;Farnham&quot; itself burned 20 &quot;tons&quot; per year.

==Community==

The two neighbourhoods on Amherst Island Stella and Emerald still reveal the forgotten steam-boat landings. Stella, formerly &quot;Lower Landing&quot; is the metropolis, where the ferry docks, has McGinn&#x27;s General Store, LCBO Convenience Outlet, the Back Kitchen, Neilson Store Museum, and Weasel &amp; Easel. It borrows its name from the Stella Post Office, the remaining postal outlet for the Island. Emerald, formerly &quot;Upper Landing&quot; is a collection of a dozen houses and a church towards the west end of the Island.

The island is accessible from the mainland only by water or air. A toll ferry service, carrying people, cyclists and motorists, connects the hamlet of Stella on the Island with Millhaven on the mainland. The ferry, M/V &quot;Frontenac II&quot;, runs 365 days a year, with a crossing time of about 20 minutes. There is a nominal charge for bicycles and motorcycles while pedestrians are free. The ferry service is operated by Loyalist Township.

The resident population of about 450 people doubles during the summer months. The Amherst Island Community Centre is available outside of regular school hours.

The Ministry of Transportation has awarded a $51.7 million contract for the conversion of the existing ferry docks from side-loading ramps to end-loading ramps to allow for easier access to and from the Island. Construction was completed in 2022, including improved vehicle queuing areas, public restrooms and heated waiting areas.

MTO has further announced plans to construct a new $20 million ferry for Amherst Island to replace the M/V &quot;Frontenac II&quot; near the end of 2019 &quot;M/V_Amherst_Islander_II&quot;, anticipated Spring 2023].

== Amherst Island Radio 101.3 FM ==
A volunteer community radio station, Amherst Island Radio CJAI 101.3 FM, began broadcasting on April 1, 2006, originally on 93.7 FM. Previously licensed as a developmental community radio station, CJAI changed frequency to 92.1 FM in October 2007 following the licensing of a new radio station on the adjacent 93.5 frequency in Kingston, and was granted a permanent license on December 6, 2007. It is a 100% volunteer operated station, and is concerned with the preservation of harmony between the rural and urban way of life, accurate and timely information of local events, and the promotion of Canadian musical talent throughout Loyalist Township and beyond. In October 2021, CJAI expanded its broadcasting power and changed frequency to 101.3 FM.

==Notable islanders==
Native islanders include Harry Raymond Fleming (1892–1942), Canadian MP for Humboldt, Saskatchewan, and English-born artist Daniel Fowler (1810–1894), who immigrated to Amherst Island in 1843 and remained there until his death. Fowler stated in his autobiography: &quot;I found a sufficient variety of subjects on the island, along with shore and inland, and never went away on any sketching trip.&quot; Inspired by the Island&#x27;s bucolic landscape, flora and fauna, Daniel Fowler was considered by his peers as &quot;one of the fathers of Canadian Art&quot;. The house he lived in during his final years still exists on the north shore of the Island. A plaque commemorates the site.

Still standing on Amherst Island is family built and worked &quot;W Brown and Son&quot; Blacksmith Shop. First established by islander John Robinson in 1879, it was sold to John Brown in 1894. The original building burned down in 1913, but was soon rebuilt and run by Wes Brown, son of John Brown. It was operated until its closure in 1971.

==Ecology==

The natural habitat of the Island was as a mature forest. Presettlement, it was a closed-canopy, mixed deciduous forest: sugar maple, beech, basswood, with some oak particularly on stony sites, red ash on the wet sites, and black ash on the intermediate sites. The conifers were restricted to isolated stands of white pine or hemlock on well-drained sites, and presumably some white cedar. The Island forest also included hickories, American chestnut and black walnut. The trees would have formed a closed canopy, uneven-aged mature forest. The incidence of forest fires or insect devastation would have been extremely rare, certainly less than once per millennium. Indeed, the most significant perturbations would have been wind and/or ice storms. The forest canopy, particularly near the shore, would have been (and still is) shaped by the winds. There was an accumulated, rich organic component to the forest soil profile.

That forest is gone. Currently there is a steady-state condition of grassland. Centuries of agriculture has depleted the organic matter, the resulting heavy soil is characterized as white clay. The annual summer drought and winter wind-burn combine as a harsh environment for all small trees, even before our Climate Crisis. The recurring plagues of both meadow vole and white-tailed deer threaten the few young trees. emerald ash borer is about to destroy the significant Ash component. The Island is threatened to permanently lose vital nesting, perching, and shelter habitat.

Amherst Island is internationally recognized for concentrations of wintering hawks and owls and is home to the Owl Woods nature reserve. Up to 10 species of owls have been recorded during a single winter. short-eared owls, long-eared owls and great horned owls are among the resident bird population. Visitors from the far and near north - snowy owls, saw-whet owls, and the rare boreal owl as well as eastern screech owls and barred owls – add to the owl population during late fall and winter. Both red-tailed hawks and rough-legged hawks are usually present, and there are annual sightings of bald eagles, peregrine falcons and turkey vultures.

Amherst Island is internationally known as an Important Bird Area and a key migratory location for birds; this fact has caused some concern for those wary of the proposed industrial wind turbine project slated to be built on the island.

The Island is noted for farming, particularly of sheep – of which there are several thousand on the Island, mainly at Stonebrae, Foot Flats, and Topsy Farms. The island&#x27;s roads, built long ago, have little motorist traffic (excepting the hourly rush for the ferry) making the Island an excellent locale for cycling, especially on the gravel roads that meander along the Island shores. The Island has warm moderate summers, cold brisk winters and steady lake winds most of the year.

&quot;Islands of Life&quot;, a report published in 2010 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, ranks Amherst Island second in biodiversity significance among the islands of northeast Lake Ontario; second only in significance to its larger neighbour, Wolfe Island.

==Dry stone walls==
The Dry Stone Walling Association of Canada (aka Dry Stone Canada) believes that Amherst Island contains the largest known concentration of historic Irish dry stone walls in Canada. Many of the walls are considered to be at least 160 years old.

==Neilson Store Museum==
The museum reflects the life and times of the Island with exhibits depicting early schools, industrial tools, family life, natural history and transportation, and collected treasures. The museum building itself is also an exhibit; built in 1883 by James S. Neilson, the Island grain merchant who opened this general store. His business flourished for nearly a century, in turn operated by his sons. Over the years, Neilson’s Store and dock became the commercial centre of the Island. It provided services in shipping and receiving goods and produce, storing and selling coal, barley and milled feed.

==Wind farm turbine development==
Steady lake winds, especially in winter, make some people believe that the island is an ideal potential location for wind turbines. Several companies have expressed interest in developing industrial wind turbine projects on the Island. After initial assessment two firms have withdrawn; one is still pursuing this action, encouraged by residents who have signed leases for wind farm turbines to be sited on their lands.

Some island residents are opposed to the project, raising concerns that the proposed twenty-six 51-storey wind turbines will have a negative impact on the rich natural and cultural heritage and on tourism, both on the Island and in local mainland communities, as well as on migratory bird, bat and Blanding&#x27;s Turtle populations. Several groups of residents have formed as a result of the proposals. The Island landowners who have agreed to host turbines on their land have formed Citizens of Amherst Island for Renewable Energy (CAIRE). Those opposed to wind power development on the Island have formed the Association to Protect Amherst Island (APAI) and a coordinated sister group, SaveAI. In January 2012, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture asked the Ontario government to put a moratorium on all wind turbine projects until the health effects of this project and other issues have been properly assessed.

In 2011 Senator Bob Runciman championed a motion which resulted in a unanimous vote for a moratorium on wind-farm development along eastern Lake Ontario until the impact on birds and bats can be studied. Such a moratorium would protect Important Bird Areas and the migratory flyways - Prince Edward County and Amherst Island were featured. No action was taken by either the Federal government or the Liberal Provincial government.

In 2013 Amherst Island was voted one of Canada&#x27;s top ten endangered places by the National Heritage Trust because of the threat of wind turbines to the cultural and natural heritage of this Island. The Trust continues to monitor the situation.

In September 2015, Windlectric Inc., a power generation company based in Oakville, Ontario, agreed to invest CAD272.5 million (US$181.33 million) in the construction and development of Amherst Island wind energy project. The total installed capacity will be 74.3 MW, from 26 wind turbine generators. The wind turbines were expected to commence commercial operations in fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017 but actually became operational in early 2018.

<text>The East Anglia Transport Museum is an open-air transport museum, with numerous historic public transport vehicles (including many in full working order). It is located in Carlton Colville a suburb of Lowestoft, Suffolk. It is the only museum in the country where visitors can ride on buses, trams and trolleybuses, as well as a narrow-gauge railway.

==History==
The museum was founded on its present site at Carlton Colville in 1965, following the rescue in 1962 by four enthusiasts of the body of an old Lowestoft tram (number 14), which had been used for a number of years as a summerhouse. The site was formerly a meadow, donated by the founder and first chairman of the Museum Society, Albert Bird. The first buildings on the site were constructed in 1966, and the museum opened to the public on 28 May 1972. Full tram and trolleybus operations began in 1981, following the construction of a suitable roadway.

The Museum&#x27;s narrow-gauge railway, known as the East Suffolk Light Railway, opened in 1973. It was some long, running along the northern edge of the site, and the -gauge track was constructed from materials obtained from a sand quarry at Leziate, from Canvey Island, and from the Southwold Railway. Signals were obtained from several locations in the vicinity. The museum also owns a van body which once ran on the Southwold Railway.

In 2016, the museum acquired some land adjacent to the main site. Waveney District Council granted planning permission for the museum to extend its site, as the museum was beneficial to the local economy. The plan was to lengthen the tramway, the trolleybus route and the narrow gauge railway, and to nearly double the site area, at an estimated cost of one million pounds. A new exhibition hall was to be built devoted to Eastern Coach Works, a major builder of bus and train bodywork in nearby Lowestoft until it closed in 1987. A new tram depot and trolleybus depot were to be built. Twenty vehicles in store at Ellough near Beccles were to be moved to the Carlton Colville site where they could be viewed.

The East Suffolk Light Railway, which originally terminated near the woodland tramway, was first extended, including construction of a flat crossing to allow the trains to pass over the tramway. In April 2023 the tram depot opened, with space for six tramcars, three in each lane. It accommodated the top deck of Glasgow 488, Brush cars 625 and 627, Double-deck Streamliner 726 and a stamping point for the museum&#x27;s stamp trail.
==Exhibits==
The museum has many exhibits ranging from a 1904 Lowestoft Corporation tram to a 1985 Sinclair C5. Tram rides are available on a route passing the museum&#x27;s trolleybus depot and up to a terminus at Woodside. Originally, the trolleybus route extended as far as the trolleybus depot where passengers could change for a ride on the museum&#x27;s 2 ft gauge railway to Chapel Road (the other end of the tram route), or they could stay on the trolleybus whilst it performed a 3-point turn and returned to the museum entrance via the same route.

A muddy field was tarmacadammed as the Back Road, and renamed as Herting Street, after the donor who supported these works. On 12 July 2008 a loop created along the Back Road, linking in with the existing overhead wiring near the museum&#x27;s entrance, opened, Britain&#x27;s first trolleybus extension for many decades.

Exhibits include No. 1521, the last trolleybus to operate under its own power in London, which had had the world&#x27;s largest trolleybus network. It was one of a batch of 150 L3 class vehicles built on chassis made by Associated Equipment Company (AEC) and Metro Cammell Weymann in 1939–40, and made its last journey in the evening of 8 May 1962.

<text>A videophile (literally, &quot;one who loves sight&quot;) is one who is concerned with achieving high-quality results in the recording and playback of movies, TV programs, etc.

==Criteria==
Similar to audiophile values, videophile values may be applied at all stages of the chain: the initial audio-visual recording, the video production process, and the playback (usually in a home setting).
Some of the aspects of video that most videophiles are concerned with include frame rate, color system, resolution, compression artifacts, motion artifacts, video noise, screen size, etc. In additional to traditional remastering using original film negatives (for instance) or basic upscaling, commercial software such as Topaz Video AI are able to harness the power of artificial intelligence to automatically upscale content in a dynamic fashion. A hybrid strategy of combining AI remastering and manual adjustment is exemplified in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; (2022)&quot;.&quot;

==Origin==
The term &quot;videophile&quot; was popularised, if not coined, by Tallahassee, Florida-based attorney and writer Jim Lowe, editor and publisher of &quot;The Videophile&#x27;s Newsletter&quot;, the first issue of which appeared in the summer of 1976. This was the first publication to unite fans of the Sony Betamax home video recorder (and later VHS, introduced in 1977). The newsletter later became &quot;The Videophile&quot;, a nationally distributed magazine, the last issue of which was published in 1981.

<text>Walt Disney Studios Park (French: Parc Walt Disney Studios) is the second of two theme parks built at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France. The park opened on 16 March 2002, and it is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. Upon opening, it was dedicated to show business, movie themes, production, and behind-the-scenes, but in the 2010s, in a similar manner to Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, it began to distance itself from the original studio backlot theming and entered a new direction of attraction development inspired by Disney stories. The park is represented by the Earffel Tower, a water tower with Mickey Mouse ears similar to the one formerly located at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, which in turn was inspired by the water tower at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California.

As of 2024, the park is undergoing a overhaul that will double the footprint of the park, adding a World of Frozen land. As part of the project, the park will be renamed Disney Adventure World. In 2023, the park hosted 5.7 million visitors, making it the 20th-most visited theme park in the world and the third-most visited in Europe.

== History ==
Initial plans for a second theme park, named Disney-MGM Studios Europe or Disney-MGM Studios Paris, were scheduled to open in 1995, though these plans were canceled around mid-1992 due to the resort&#x27;s financial issues at the time. After the resort began to make a profit, these plans were revived on a much smaller scale. The park was announced on 29 September 1999. Construction would officially begin a year later in 2000. Walt Disney Studios Park opened on 16 March 2002.

In the 2019 documentary series &quot;The Imagineering Story&quot;, Bruce Vaughn, the Chief Creative Executive of Walt Disney Imagineering, described his reaction when he visited the park when it first opened:
In 2007, Walt Disney Studios Park began expanding. June 2007 saw an expansion to Animation Courtyard opened along with the new area wide name &quot;Toon Studio&quot;. It is themed as a &quot;toon backlot&quot;, representing the film studio workplace of animated characters, where they produce their animated films. The concept has been created exclusively for Walt Disney Studios Park and features two rides not seen in any other Disney theme park, along with small merchandising locations and many character meet-and-greets. This expansion phase added Crush&#x27;s Coaster, an indoor spinning roller coaster, and Cars Quatre Roues Rallye themed after Pixar&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Cars&quot;, with the ride taking the form of an enhanced teacups ride. A similar ride is found in Mermaid Lagoon at Tokyo DisneySea. On 22 December 2007, Production Courtyard grew in size with the introduction of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror, which soft opened with the new Hollywood Boulevard.

In March of 2008, a variant of Stitch Encounter was imported from Hong Kong Disneyland with the new name &#x27;Stitch live!&#x27;. It was one of two shows introduced to replace the Disney Channel Studio Tour and Cyberspace mountain attractions.

In 2009, new entertainment opened at Walt Disney Studios to run alongside &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Party&quot;, which began in April 2009. &quot;Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage!&quot; was the second of the two shows to replace the Disney Channel Studio Tour and was presented in French, English and Spanish. In addition to Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage! came the opening of Disney Stars &#x27;n&#x27; Cars, a smaller version of Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade imported from Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World, Florida. The parade was introduced to replace &#x27;Disney&#x27;s Cinema Parade&#x27; which had been operating since opening in 2002.

In August 2010, expansions continued with the opening of Toy Story Playland to coincide with the new Disney·Pixar film &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, &quot;shrinking&quot; guests to the size of a toy. The three attractions are a Half Pipe coaster named RC Racer, a parachute jumpstyle ride named Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop, and a Music Express train named Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin, all themed intricately around the first two &quot;Toy Story&quot; films.

The first push of expansions came to an end with the addition of &#x27;Ratatouille: L&#x27;Aventure Totalement Toquée de Rémy&#x27;, soft opening 21 June 2014 and fully opening on 10 July.

On 27 February 2018, Bob Iger announced a transformative multi-year expansion, opening in phases from 2021. The cost of this expansion is €2 billion. It will feature new areas based on Marvel and &quot;Frozen&quot;, all surrounding a new man-made lake.

This second round of expansion began with the closing of Armageddon – Les Effets Speciaux on 31 March 2019 followed by &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Avec Aerosmith&quot; (2 September 2019), Studio Tram Tour: Behind the Magic (6 January 2020) and The Moteurs... Action! (13 March 2020) in order for both the walkway to the lake expansion to be started (demolition of the tram tour station) and for Avengers Campus to replace the Backlot area of the park.

On 14 March 2020, Walt Disney Studios Park, alongside Disneyland Park, temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Both parks reopened on 15 July 2020 with strict rules such as limited guest attendance, social distancing, and mandatory wearing of face masks. The park closed again on 29 October 2020 following a second nationwide lockdown, the resort&#x27;s original intended reopening on 2 April 2021 was ultimately deferred to 17 June.

On 15 June 2021 the new changes and expansion to the park started to arrive with the soft opening of Cars: Road Trip. This attraction consists of the loop for &#x27;Catastrophe Canyon&#x27; from the Studio Tram Tour redecorated with props and characters based on the world of the 2006 film Cars.

On 9 July 2022, Avengers Campus soft opened as the first phase of the aforementioned expansion. It opened with the Spider-Man W.E.B. Adventure and the rethemed &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Avec Aerosmith&quot;, known as Avengers Assemble: Flight Force.

On 12 April 2024, Disney announced that as of the opening of the now named &#x27;World of Frozen&#x27;, Walt Disney Studios Park would be rebranded as Disney Adventure World. The park will consist of the areas &#x27;World Premiere Plaza&#x27; (Formerly Studio 1), World of Hollywood, &#x27;World of Frozen&#x27;, &#x27;Adventure Bay&#x27; (The lake), and &#x27;Adventure Way&#x27;. These will be joined by Front Lot, Worlds of Pixar, and Avengers Campus scheduled to debut in 2025.

On 24 May 2024, it was announced that was replaced by a new outdoor shows, &quot;Alice &amp; The Queen of Hearts: Back to Wonderland&quot;, and the areas was renamed Theater of the Stars, which was became part of the last remaining &quot;Production Courtyard&quot; area until 29 September 2024 and right behind the location of &quot;Avengers Campus&quot;, since the final performance of &quot;The Moteurs... Action!&quot; and &quot;Backlot&quot; area would be permanently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on Paris for over four years ago.

At D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event 2024 on 11 August 2024, it was announced that &quot;World of Frozen&quot; was delayed to 2026, while a new &quot;Lion King&quot; Land will be built at Disney Adventure World.

On 30 September, 2024, it was announced that a new nighttime spectacular show, &quot;Doctor Strange: Mystery of the Mystics&quot;, which will be premiere in Avengers Campus on 23 November, 2024 until 29 March, 2025 at Walt Disney Studios Park.

On 26 October, 2024, it was announced that a new temporarily show, &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Musical Moment&quot;, which would be premiere in Studio D on 1 November, 2024 until 30 March, 2025 at Walt Disney Studios Park, since it was announced that the final performance of &quot;Disney Junior Dream Factory&quot; would be permanently closed on 31 August 2024. In December 2024, it was announced that &quot;Alice &amp; The Queen of Hearts: Back to Wonderland&quot; as the outdoor shows, would be return on 17 May, 2025 until 31 August, 2025 at Disney Adventure World.

== Areas ==

Walt Disney Studios Park is divided into five &quot;studio lots.&quot; Originally these were to represent various aspects of film production present at a Hollywood film studio, though this connection has weakened over time with the addition of lands themed for prominent film franchises.

=== Front Lot ===
Front Lot serves as the park&#x27;s main entrance and is home to most shops and services of the park, the Earffel Tower is located here. The entrance courtyard, &quot;La Place des Frères Lumière&quot;, is designed in Spanish Colonial Revival style, a style common in Hollywood in the 1930s. It is based on the design of the original Disney Bros. Studios on Hyperion Avenue. The central feature of the courtyard is a large &quot;Fantasia&quot; fountain. The name of the courtyard is a tribute to the French inventors of cinema.

====Former features====

The venue closed in April 2024 and will reopen after a refurbishment as World Premiere, with the counter-service restaurant Hollywood Gardens Restaurant.

=== Toon Studio ===
&quot;Toon Studio&quot; features attractions and shopping based on Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios franchises, including a live show, Mickey and the Magician. When the park originally opened in 2002, the area was known as Animation Courtyard. In 2007, as part of the park&#x27;s fifth anniversary, two new rides were added: Crush&#x27;s Coaster and Cars Quatre Roues Rallye. In 2010, the area was expanded with the creation of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; Playland. In January 2012, construction began on a new &quot;Ratatouille&quot;-themed ride and restaurant.

In 2021, most of this area&#x27;s attractions were separated into the newly named &quot;Worlds of Pixar&quot; area of the park.

=== Worlds of Pixar ===
Formerly a part of the Toon Studio section, the Worlds of Pixar area features rides, attractions, shopping, and restaurants based on Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Ratatouille&quot; franchises.

==== &quot;Toy Story&quot; Playland ====
Toy Story Playland is a sub-area of Toon Studio/Worlds of Pixar themed to the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, which opened on 17 August 2010 to market and promote &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. The area shrinks guests down to the size of the toy as they ride three over-sized attractions.

=== Production Courtyard ===
Production Courtyard&#x27;s theme revolves around the production aspect of Hollywood movies and the Hollywood mythos, including movie legends. The land contains two distinct parts: &quot;Hollywood Boulevard&quot;, which features Hollywood-inspired street sets and the ride &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror – A New Dimension of Chills and &quot;Place des Stars&quot; themed around the production facilities of movie lots, containing Stitch Live!.

=== Marvel Avengers Campus ===
Marvel Avengers Campus, a land themed around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, soft opened on 9 July 2022, and opened to the public 20 July 2022. Anchored as a transformed Paris-based secret location for S.H.I.E.L.D., the area&#x27;s attractions and dining include Avengers Assemble: Flight Force (an Iron Man re-theme of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Avec Aerosmith) and Spider-Man W.E.B. Adventure (a clone of Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure from the Anaheim version of the land). This area replaced the previous &quot;Backlot&quot; lot of the park.

=== Former areas ===

==== Backlot ====

The Backlot was an opening day lot themed after actual movie backlots with an industrial theme. This lot featured the attractions Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Avec Aerosmith, the Moteurs... Action!: Stunt Show Spectacular, and the special effects show Armageddon – Les Effets Speciaux. The cafeteria service restaurant Blockbuster Café, the buffet Restaurant des Stars, and a small diner Café des Cascadeurs were also part of the Backlot. This area was closed in 2019 to make way for Avengers Campus, except for Theater of the Stars.

=== Future areas ===
On 27 February 2018, Bob Iger announced that The Walt Disney Company will invest €2 billion into the Disneyland Paris resort. The Walt Disney Studios Park will be expanded with two new areas based on Marvel and &quot;Frozen&quot;. In addition to the two new areas, the expansion includes a new lake, which will be the focal point for entertainment experiences and will also connect each of the new park areas.

==== World of Frozen ====
The second phase of the expansion will be World of Frozen which was originally scheduled to be open in 2023 but has since been delayed to 2026, since the opening date was postponed indefinitely followed the closures of the park due to COVID-19 pandemic. The land will be set in the kingdom of Arendelle (after the events of &quot;Frozen&quot; and before &quot;Frozen II&quot;), where Queen Elsa has declared a Summer Snow Day for its citizens. A new and expanded version of Frozen Ever After will debut with the land as well as a restaurant and a shop.

====Lion King area====
In August 2024, it was announced that a &quot;Lion King&quot; area with a flume ride based on the original 1994 animated film will be added to the park.

<doc id="1165851" wikidata="Q3283617" url="?curid=1165851" title="Battery (tort)">
<text>In common law, battery is a tort falling under the umbrella term &#x27;trespass to the person&#x27;. Entailing unlawful contact which is directed and intentional, or reckless (or, in Australia, negligently) and voluntarily bringing about a harmful or offensive contact with a person or to something closely associated with them, such as a bag or purse, without legal consent.

Unlike assault, in which the fear of imminent contact may support a civil claim, battery involves an actual contact. The contact can be by one person (the tortfeasor) of another (the victim), with or without a weapon, or the contact may be by an object brought about by the tortfeasor. For example, the intentional driving of a car into contact with another person, or the intentional striking of a person with a thrown rock, is a battery.

Unlike criminal law, which recognizes degrees of various crimes involving physical contact, there is but a single tort of battery. Lightly flicking a person&#x27;s ear is battery, as is severely beating someone with a tire iron. Neither is there a separate tort for a battery of a sexual nature. However, a jury hearing a battery case is free to assess higher damages for a battery in which the contact was particularly offensive or harmful.

Since it is practically impossible to avoid physical contact with others during everyday activities, everyone is presumed to consent to a certain amount of physical contact with others, such as when one person unavoidably brushes or bumps against another in a crowded lift, passage or stairway. However, physical contact may not be deemed consented to if the acts that cause harm are prohibited acts.

== General characteristics of battery ==

===Contact required===
Battery is a form of trespass to the person and as such no actual damage (e.g. injury) needs to be proved. Only proof of contact (with the appropriate level of intention or negligence) needs to be made. An attempt to commit a battery, but without making actual contact, may constitute a tort of assault. The tort of battery developed out of a general judicial respect of an individual&#x27;s autonomy and right not to be interfered with.

Battery need not require body-to-body contact. Touching an object &quot;intimately connected&quot;, to a person (such as an object they are holding) can also be battery. Furthermore, a contact may constitute a battery even if there is a delay between the defendant&#x27;s act and the contact to the plaintiff&#x27;s injury. For example, where a person who digs a pit with the intent that another will fall into it later, or where a person who mixes something offensive in food that they know another will eat, has committed a battery against that other when the other does in fact fall into the pit or eats the offensive matter.

=== Character of intent ===
The character of intent in civil battery is different from that for criminal battery. The character of intent sufficient for battery also varies between common law countries, and often within differing jurisdictions of those countries. In Australia, negligence in an action is sufficient to establish intent. In the United States, intention to do an act that ultimately results in contact that is either harmful or offensive is sufficient for the tort of battery, while intention to inflict an injury on another is required for criminal battery. In the U.S., courts are split on how to test for sufficient intent. Some courts use the single intent rule which seeks to determine whether or not the defendant intended to touch the plaintiff, while some courts use the dual intent rule which seeks to determine whether or not the defendant sought to harm or offend by touching.

Additionally, courts also follow the transferred intent doctrine in battery claims. For instance, if a person swings to hit one person and instead misses and hits another, they can still be held liable for a battery. Intent to commit a different tort can transfer in the same way. If a person throws a rock towards one person intending only to scare them (but not to hit them), they will be liable for battery to a different person who is hit by that rock. In the United States, critics of this doctrine believe that the tort of negligence has superseded the need for transferred intent. One issue is that the statute of limitations can be shorter for intentional torts such as battery than the statutes of limitations for negligent torts.

=== Awareness not required ===
The victim of a battery need not be aware of the act at the time for the tort to have occurred. For example, if a surgeon performing an appendectomy on an unconscious patient decides to take out the patient&#x27;s spleen for his personal collection, the surgeon has committed a battery against the patient. Similarly, a battery occurs if the surgeon allows a cousin who is a plumber with no medical training to help fish out the appendix during the surgery. Although the patient has consented to being touched by the surgeon, this consent does not extend to people who the patient would not reasonably anticipate would be participating in the procedure.

The battery may occur even if the victim is unaware of the contact at the time &quot;and&quot; the defendant is nowhere near the scene at the time of the contact. If a tortfeasor puts an offensive substance in another person&#x27;s food, and the other person consumes the offensive substance, the battery has been committed even if the victim is not made aware that they have eaten something offensive until much later.

== Battery by country ==

===United States===

In the United States, the common law requires the contact for battery be &quot;harmful or offensive.&quot; The offensiveness is measured against a reasonable person standard. Looking at a contact objectively, as a reasonable person would see it, would this contact be offensive? Thus, a hypersensitive person would fail on a battery action if jostled by fellow passengers on a subway, as this contact is expected in normal society and a reasonable person would not find it offensive. Harmful is defined by any physical damage to the body.

Because courts have recognized a cause of action for battery in the absence of body-to-body contact, the outer limits of the tort can often be hard to define. The Pennsylvania Superior Court attempted to provide some guidance in this regard in the &quot;Herr v. Booten&quot; case by stressing the importance of the concept of one&#x27;s personal dignity. In that case, college students purchased and provided their friend with alcohol on the eve of his twenty-first birthday. After drinking nearly an entire bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, the underage man died of acute ethanol poisoning. Reversing the decision of the trial court, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that supplying a minor with alcoholic beverages, while certainly constituting a negligent act, did not rise to the level of a battery. In the words of Judge Montemuro, supplying a person with alcohol &quot;is not an act which impinges upon that individual&#x27;s sense of physical dignity or inviolability.&quot;

=== England and Wales ===
Following UK Tort law the tort of battery is where the defendant intentionally, or recklessly, and unlawfully makes direct contact with the claimant. An outcome is intentional when a defendant seeks that outcome on purpose and when the outcome was virtually certain to be the consequence of acting. Likewise, a person is reckless when they foresaw a risk, but took it anyway, even if to do so was unreasonable in the circumstances known to them (As established in &quot;R v G&quot;). This was also made clear in the case of &quot;Iqbal v Police Officer&#x27;s Association&quot;, where it was held that for trespass to the person, intention or subjective recklessness is required. Essentially, &#x27;a battery is the intentional application of unlawful force to another person&#x27;, &#x27;typically A stabs B; X shoots Y; Henry punches Thomas. The essence of the wrong is the &#x27;invasion of the physical person of the [claimant]&#x27;

This tort is actionable per se, which means no harm is needed to be proven for the tortfeasor to be held liable. The key case of &quot;Collins v Wilcock&quot; clarified the law in this area&quot;,&quot; establishing: &quot;The fundamental principle, plain and incontestable, is that every person&#x27;s body is inviolate&quot;. Essentially you have the right not to be touched or interfered with in any way. Your body is yours, and yours only, any contact is potentially unlawful: there is no minimum level of violence condoned by the law. However, some contact is unavoidable and this form of contact is categorised as &#x27;exigencies of everyday life&#x27;, I.e. when you walk down a corridor and bump into someone, this is not a battery (tort): &#x27;Horseplay among children at school might similarly be lawful&#x27;. Contact is lawful when the other person consents.

==== Establishing &#x27;direct contact&#x27; ====
There must be a form of contact. A push or a shove is clearly direct contact, some part of their body has touched your own, however, the courts have also interpreted situations that go far beyond this as &#x27;directness&#x27;.

For example, in the case of &quot;Scott v Shepherd&quot; where someone threw a lighted squib and it was picked up and thrown at someone by another thrower than the original, it was still held as &#x27;direct contact&#x27; from the original thrower, through the chain of causation.

Moreover, direct contact has been established where: a defendant struck the claimant&#x27;s horse, so the horse bolted, throwing the claimant to the ground and when a defendant overturned a chair upon which the claimant was sitting. Thus, &#x27;direct contact&#x27; can extend to direct through another source according to certain UK court interpretation. Finally, Intent can be transferred and &#x27;transferred malice&#x27; is recognised too within tort law, I.e. in &quot;Bici v ministry of Defence.&quot;

==== How have the requirements changed? ====
This tort has changed significantly from how it used to be. In past case-law such as &quot;Cole v Turner [1704],&quot; &#x27;the least touching of another in anger&#x27; was what constituted a battery. Therefore, some form of anger used to be required, following cases such as this.

Moreover, in the case of &quot;Wilson v Pringle [1987]&quot; the court said that contact to be tortious must be &#x27;hostile&#x27;.

However, these requirements were not helpful, as they would mean that an unwanted kiss is not a battery due to a lack of anger or hostility. Thus, thankfully these requirements were changed to follow &quot;Collins v Wilcock&quot;

==Defenses==
The standard defenses to trespass to the person, namely necessity, consent, self-defense, and defense of others, apply to battery. As practical examples, under the defense of necessity, a physician may touch a person without that person&#x27;s consent in order to render medical aid to them in an emergency.

=== Consent ===
Under the defence of consent, a person who has, either expressly or impliedly, consented to participation in a contact sport cannot claim in battery against other participants for a contact permitted by the rules of that sport, or expected to occur within the course of play. For example, a basketball player who commits a hard foul against an opposing player does not thereby commit a battery, because fouls are a regular part of the course of the game, even though they result in a penalty. However, a player who struck another player during a time-out would be liable for battery, because there is no game-related reason for such a contact to occur. I.e. in &quot;Condon v Basi&quot; you can consent in a sports context to a risk of harm but this does not extend to unreasonable contact, the contact must be reasonable.

=== Medical consent ===
Moreover, you can also consent to medical treatment:

&quot;&#x27;All common law persons have the right not to suffer bodily violation without their consent&quot;&#x27;, as seen in &quot;F v West Berkshire&quot;. It is therefore, &#x27;essential that clinicians involved in either treating or advising patients consider the issue of consent.&#x27; It is the consent of the patient which prevents the doctor who performs surgery from otherwise being liable in the tort of battery, the courts will only recognise true consent when the patient has been informed in broad terms about the nature of the procedure (as demonstrated in &quot;Chatterson v Gerson&quot;&quot;)&quot;.

A doctor is under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that a patient is aware of risks to which they are likely to attach significance. Whilst a doctor can withhold information if they consider it detrimental to the patient&#x27;s health, this exception does not entitle a doctor to withhold information just because the patient may make a decision the doctor disapproves of. As demonstrated in the case of &quot;Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board.&quot;

Statute provides that children aged 16 and over can consent to medical treatment, provided they have sufficient maturity and intelligence to understand the nature and implications of the proposed treatment. Therefore, any action taken has been consented to and would not constitute a tort of battery. Parent consent may also suffice.

=== Those who cannot consent ===
Some people cannot consent:

Following the statute of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 s. 5:

* Following s. 1. 3 A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practical steps to help them to do so have been taken without success.
* Following s. 1. 4 A person must not be treated as unable to make a decision just because they make an unwise decision.

Mental Capacity Act 2005

Section 2 People who lack capacity

(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time they are unable to make a decision for themself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.

(2)   It does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary.

(3)   A lack of capacity cannot be established merely by reference to-

(a)   a person&#x27;s age or appearance, or

(b)   a condition of his, or an aspect of his behaviour, which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about his capacity

(4)   In proceedings under this Act or any other enactment, any question whether a person lacks capacity within the meaning of this Act must be decided on the balance of probabilities.

This provides that care or treatment can go ahead after all, if it is in the best interest of the patient. However, when medical treatment is no longer in the best interests of the patient, then no medical care is allowed and must be withdrawn (Airedale Trust v Bland). Also, if a patient, who is mentally competent, refuses to consent, that is the end of the matter and the treatment cannot proceed as doing so would be a battery. Even if it puts at risk the life of the patient&#x27;s unborn child (St George&#x27;s Healthcare NHS Trust v S). And even if it risks the patient&#x27;s own death (Re B [2002]).

=== Self-defence ===
Self-defence as to battery can occur when a person reasonably believes that they are going to be attacked by another person, and involves engaging in a reasonable level of physical contact with that person in order to prevent that person from engaging in a physical attack. This requires an honest and reasonable belief that you are about to be attacked:

&quot;Lord Scott&quot; noted at paragraph [18] of &quot;Ashley v Chief Constable of West Sussex Police&quot; that &#x27;it is one thing to say that if A&#x27;s mistaken belief was honestly held that they should not be punished by the criminal law, it would be quite another to say that A&#x27;s unreasonably held mistaken belief would be subjected to physical violence by A&#x27;.

The requirements for self-defence are different from those in criminal law; in civil law, the belief of imminent danger need not be reasonably held, and may allow a pre-emptive attack.

== Damages ==
See main article: Damages

The most commonly awarded damages for the tort of battery is compensatory damages, whereby you put the claimant in the position they would have been in had the incident not occurred. This damage only occurs where the claimant has &#x27;suffered injury of some sort&#x27;, from being battered.

However rarer remedies such as an injunction may be awarded if the conduct is repetitive, to prevent the behaviour repeating again. Aggravated damages are also available but only &quot;when the trespass to the person constitutes an affront to the claimants dignity, causing them humiliation or injury to feelings.&#x27; For example, in the case of &quot;Appleton v Garrett,&quot; where a dentist performed unnecessary dental treatment on patients and because of the deception of the patients the consent did not count.

Where the court still recognises that a tort has taken place, but there is no damage, the court may award the claimant nominal damages. This is a &#x27;token sum of money which, along with the court&#x27;s judgement, records the vindication of the claimant&#x27;s rights.&#x27;

=== Tournament standings ===
=== Final ===


The historic win by the Kiwis over an Australian 17 containing only 3 Queensland players and one player from the previous month&#x27;s 2005 NRL grand final put an end to the Kangaroos&#x27; dominance in international rugby league. It was the first time Australia, hot favourites for the match, had failed to win a series or tournament since France defeated them in both Tests of the 1978 Kangaroo tour.

The win by New Zealand was the first time the Kiwis had beaten Australia in a test series or tournament (not including one-off test wins in 1971, 1987 and 1998) since 1952. Australian coach Wayne Bennett resigned from the national coaching post just over a week after the final.

== Player statistics ==


=== Non-series tests ===
During the series, Australia and New Zealand played additional Tests against France. This was the first time the two teams had met in a test match since Australia&#x27;s 74–0 win in Béziers in the last game of the 1994 Kangaroo tour.


For this match, Craig Gower was given the honour of captaining Australia for the first time.

Australia 44 (A Minichiello 2, T Waterhouse 2, M Cooper, S Prince, C Gower, W Mason tries; S Prince 6 goals) defeated
France 12 (L Frayssinous, M Gresqueu tries; L Frayssinous 2 goals)


=== Other game ===
New Zealand played a midweek match against England &quot;A&quot; which did not count as a test match. Halftime was 12-all.
