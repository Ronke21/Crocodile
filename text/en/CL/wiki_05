<text>Operation Motorman was a large operation carried out by the British Army (HQ Northern Ireland) in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The operation took place in the early hours of 31 July 1972 with the aim of retaking the &quot;no-go areas&quot; (areas controlled by residents, including Irish republican paramilitaries) that had been established in Belfast and other urban centres. In Derry, Operation Carcan (or Car Can), initially proposed as a separate operation, was executed as part of Motorman.

==Background==
The Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 marked the beginning of the conflict known as the Troubles. As a result of the riots, Northern Ireland&#x27;s two main cities, Belfast and Derry, had become more segregated than before. Many neighbourhoods became entirely Irish nationalist or entirely unionist. In some places, residents and paramilitaries built barricades to seal off and protect their neighbourhoods from incursions by &quot;the other side&quot;, the security forces or both. These became known as &quot;no-go areas&quot;.

By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to block access to what was known as Free Derry, 16 of them impassable even to the British Army&#x27;s one-ton armoured vehicles. Many of the nationalist no-go areas were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Army, the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. On 29 May 1972, the Official IRA called a ceasefire and vowed that it would not launch attacks except in self-defence.

On 21 July 1972, in the space of 75 minutes, the Provisional IRA detonated 22 bombs in Belfast. Nine people (including two soldiers and a loyalist volunteer) were killed and 130 were injured. The attack prompted the British Government to implement Operation Motorman, just ten days later.
== Preparations ==
Operation Motorman was the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956 and the biggest in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence. In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland. Almost 22,000 soldiers were involved, including 27 infantry and two armoured battalions, aided by 5,300 soldiers from the local Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). Several Centurion AVRE demolition vehicles, derived from the Centurion tank and fitted with bulldozer blades, were used. They were the only heavy armoured vehicles to be deployed operationally by the British Army in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The tanks had been transported to Northern Ireland on board the amphibious landing ship HMS &quot;Fearless&quot;, and were operated with their turrets traversed to the rear and main guns covered by tarpaulins.

This quick military buildup alerted the Provisional IRA and Official IRA that a major operation was being planned. According to local MP Ivan Cooper and others, the IRA left Derry&#x27;s no-go areas the day before the operation.
== Operation ==
The operation began at about 4:00Â a.m. on 31 July and lasted for a few hours. In &quot;no-go areas&quot; such as Free Derry, sirens were sounded by residents to alert others of the incursion. The British Army used bulldozers and Centurion AVREs to break through the barricades before flooding the no-go areas with troops in smaller, lighter armoured vehicles. Neither the Provisional IRA nor Official IRA attempted to hold their ground. Small-scale operations were carried out in other places like Lurgan, Armagh, Coalisland and Newry. RAF Canberra reconnaissance aircraft were employed to search for arms dumps through false colour imaging.

By the end of the day, Derry and Belfast had been cleared of no-go areas, but the Army remained cautious when operating in staunchly republican districts. Casement Park in Andersonstown, the main stadium of the Ulster GAA, was occupied by 19th Regiment Royal Artillery; it was returned in 1973/4.

=== Casualties ===
During the operation, the British Army shot four people in Derry, killing a civilian and an unarmed IRA member.

* Daniel Hegarty, a 15-year-old Catholic civilian, was shot along with his two cousins as they walked along Creggan Heights in Derry. The boys had gone out to see the tanks and watch the operation unfold. The shots were fired from close range by soldiers, who had hidden themselves behind a garden fence. Hegarty was shot twice in the head and was killed outright. One of his cousins, Christopher Hegarty, survived being struck in the head by a bullet. While the British government initially maintained that no crime had been committed by the soldiers involved, following the Good Friday Agreement, the case was re-opened, and in 2011 a jurors&#x27; inquest unanimously concluded that neither Hegarty boy had posed a threat when they were fired upon. Despite these findings, action was slow and in 2016 it was announced that the soldier involved, known publicly only as &quot;Soldier B&quot; in order to protect his identity, would not face charges related to Daniel&#x27;s killing. In 2018, the High Court reversed this decision however and in 2019, 47 years later, Soldier B, the individual who personally fired the fatal shots into Daniel Hegarty, was charged with murder. In the summer of 2021, all charges against Soldier B related to the shooting of the Hegartys were dropped, after key prosecution evidence was held to be inadmissible. This decision was overturned in June 2023, with the High Court of Justice ruling that the decision to drop the charges was &quot;erroneous&quot; and that Soldier B should face prosecution, but Soldier B died in September 2023 before he could be tried.

* Seamus Bradley, a 19-year-old Provisional IRA member, was shot dead by a British soldier. The army claimed that he was armed with a machine gun and had climbed a tree in Bishop&#x27;s Field, Derry before being shot. An investigation concluded in August 2019 that Bradley&#x27;s death was unjustified as he was unarmed and running across a ground while he was shot. The investigating coroner judge also ruled that Bradley could have survived had he been administered first aid or transported quickly to a hospital. The Ministry of Defence appealed against the verdict but withdrew it in October 2021.

In Belfast, some arrests were made but no armed resistance was met.

== Aftermath ==
A few hours after the conclusion of Operation Motorman, the IRA bombed Claudy. Nine civilians were killed when three car bombs exploded on the Main Street of Claudy village, County Londonderry. Five of the victims were Catholic and four were Protestant. 

In the following years, the territory of the Republic of Ireland continued to offer a safe haven for IRA members, who used the country to undertake legal and illegal venues for raising funds, to train new recruits and to flee across the border, where British security forces could not follow.

<text>Johannes Grenzfurthner (; born 1975 in Vienna) is an Austrian artist, filmmaker, writer, actor, curator, theatre director, performer and lecturer. Grenzfurthner is the founder, conceiver and artistic director of &quot;monochrom&quot;, an international art and theory group and film production company. Most of his artworks are labeled &quot;monochrom&quot;.

Grenzfurthner is an outspoken researcher in subversive and underground culture, for example the field of sexuality and technology, and one of the founders of &quot;techno-hedonism&quot;.

Boing Boing magazine referred to Grenzfurthner as &quot;leitnerd&quot;, a wordplay with the German term Leitkultur that ironically hints at Grenzfurthner&#x27;s role in nerd/hacker/art culture.

== Career ==
In the early 1990s, Grenzfurthner was a member of several BBS message boards. Grenzfurther used his online connections to create &quot;monochrom&quot;, a zine or alternative magazine that dealt with art, technology and subversive cultures. His motivation was to react to the emerging conservativism in cyber-cultures of the early 1990s, and to combine his political background in the Austrian punk and antifa movement with discussion of new technologies and the cultures they create. The publication featured interviews and essays, by e.g. Bruce Sterling, HR Giger, Eric Drexler, Terry Pratchett and Bob Black, in its experimental layout style. In 1995 the group decided to cover new artistic practices and started experimenting with different media: computer games, robots, puppet theater, musical, short films, pranks, conferences, online activism, which Grenzfurthner calls &#x27;Urban Hacking&#x27; or more specific: &#x27;Context hacking&#x27;, a term that Grenzfurthner coined.

:Context hacking transfers the hackers&#x27; objectives and methods to the network of social relationships in which artistic production occurs, and upon which it is dependent. In a metaphoric sense, these relationships also have a source code. Programs run in them, and our interaction with them is structured by a user interface. When we know how a space, a niche, a scene, a subculture or a media or political practice functions, we can change it and &quot;recode&quot; it, deconstructing its power relationships and emancipating ourselves from its compulsions and packaging guidelines.

The group is known for working with different media, art and entertainment formats. Grenzfurthner calls this &quot;looking for the best weapon of mass distribution of an idea&quot;.

=== Conferences and festivals ===

Grenzfurthner is head of the Arse Elektronika festival in San Francisco (2007), an annual academic and artistic conference and anthology series that focusses on sexuality and technology. The first conference was curated by Grenzfurthner in 2007 to answer questions about the impact of sexuality on technological innovation and adoption.

Grenzfurthner is hosting Roboexotica, the international Festival for Cocktail-Robotics (2002â) which invites researchers and artists to build machines that serve or mix cocktails. V. Vale calls Roboexotica &quot;an ironic attempt to criticize techno-triumphalism and to dissect technological hypes.&quot;

Grenzfurthner is head of &quot;Hedonistika&quot;, a festival for artistic food tech and robotic indulgement. The festival took place in MontrÃ©al at the 2014 &#x27;Biennale internationale d&#x27;art numÃ©rique&#x27;, in Holon, near Tel Aviv at &#x27;Print Screen Festival&#x27;, and in Linz at Ars Electronica 2022.

=== Theatre work, performance art ===
Grenzfurthner wrote and directed theatre plays and pieces of performance (e.g. Eignblunzn) and interventionist art.

=== Film ===
Grenzfurther is the CEO of film production company &quot;monochrom Propulsion Systems&quot;. He is member of the Austrian Director&#x27;s Guild and the Association of Austrian Documentary Filmmakers.

He wrote and directed shorts and feature films. His first TV film was the independent fantasy-comedy (2014). Grenzfurther first theatrically released feature documentary was &quot;Traceroute&quot; (2016), followed by &quot;Glossary of Broken Dreams&quot; (2018).
His horror feature &quot;Masking Threshold&quot; was premiered at Fantastic Fest in September 2021 and was released by Drafthouse Films.

His horror film &quot;Razzennest&quot; had its premiere at Fantastic Fest 2022. 
His documentary feature &quot;Hacking at Leaves&quot; had its premiere at Diagonale in 2024.
His horror mystery feature &quot;Solvent&quot; will be released 2024.

=== Academia, writing, lecturing ===
Grenzfurthner lectures at art institutions, symposions and political events, teaches at universities and mentors students.

He has published books, essays and articles on politics, contemporary art, communication processes and philosophy including &quot;Mind and Matter: Comparative Approaches Towards Complexity, Do androids sleep with electric sheep?, Of Intercourse and Intracourse: Sexuality, Biomodification and the Techno-Social Sphere and Pr0nnovation?: Pornography and Technological Innovation&quot;.

Grenzfurthner published the much debated pamphlet &quot;Hacking the Spaces&quot;, that dealt with exclusionist tendencies in the hackerspaces movement. Grenzfurthner extended his critique through lectures at the 2012 and 2014 Hackers on Planet Earth conferences in New York City.

2020 through 2021, he was editor-in-chief of the print and online magazine &quot;The Free Lunch&quot;.

Since April 2023, he has been contributing as a weekly columnist to the Austrian news magazine &quot;Profil&quot;.

=== Entertainment and acting ===
Grenzfurthner has taken a comedic turn and performed at various venues, e.g. Vienna&#x27;s Rabenhof Theater. Parts of his comedy show &quot;Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds&quot; form the basis of his documentary film Traceroute (2016). Grenzfurther is a presenter and emcee for various industry events, and guest performer at events like Goldenes Brett. Grenzfurthner has had supporting and lead parts in several theater plays. He performs in Andi Haller&#x27;s feature film &quot;Zero Crash&quot; and Michael J. Epstein&#x27;s and Sophia Cacciola&#x27;s feature film &quot;Clickbait&quot; and &quot;Umbilicus desidero&quot;. He portrays one of the two lead characters in his own film Je Suis Auto.

Grenzfurthner voice acted director Fritz Lang in Karina Longworth&#x27;s Vanity Fair podcast &quot;Love Is a Crime&quot; (together with Zooey Deschanel and Jon Hamm).

=== Community work ===
Grenzfurthner was one of the core team members in the development process of netznetz, a new kind of community-based funding system for net culture and net art together with the culture department of the city government of Vienna.

He started the &quot;Hackbus&quot; community.

Together with Florian Hufsky, Leo Findeisen and Juxi Leitner, Grenzfurthner co-organized the first international conference of the pirate parties.

=== Commercial work ===
Grenzfurthner conceptualized and co-built a robot installation to promote the products of sex toy company Bad Dragon. He created an artistic online ad campaign for Cheetos.

== Personal life ==

Grenzfurthner lives and works in Vienna. Grenzfurther grew up in Stockerau in rural Lower Austria and talks about it in his stand-up comedy &quot;Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds&quot; (2014) and his semi-autobiographical documentary film Traceroute (2016).

:If I had not grown up in Stockerau, in the boonies of Lower Austria, than I would not be what I am now. The germ cell of burgeoning nerdism is difference. The yearning to be understood, to find opportunities to share experiences, to not be left alone with one&#x27;s bizarre interest. At the same time one derives an almost perverse pleasure from wallowing in this deficit. Nerds love deficiency: that of the other, but also their own. Nerds are eager explorers, who enjoy measuring themselves against one another and also compete aggressively. And yet the nerd&#x27;s existence also comprises an element of the occult, of mystery. The way in which this power is expressed or focused is very important.

Grenzfurthner uses his personal history and upbringing as a source for his work. In a conversation with &quot;Zebrabutter&quot; he names the example that he wanted to deal with his claustrophobia, so he started a series of art performances where volunteers can be buried alive.

As a child, Grenzfurthner spent a lot of time at his grandparents&#x27; farm in the small village of UnterzÃ¶gersdorf (a cadastral municipality of Stockerau). His grandparents&#x27; stories about Nazism, World War II and the Soviet occupation in allied-occupied Austria (1945â1955) influenced monochrom&#x27;s long-term project Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.

== Controversy ==
Grenzfurthner&#x27;s name was one of 200 activists, politicians, and artists from Germany, Switzerland and Austria (only one of a total of 10 Austrian names) that were published on an ultra-right doxing list distributed on a variety of online platforms in December 2018 and January 2019. The list&#x27;s extremist creators threatened &quot;#wirkriegeneuchallee&quot; (sic!) â &quot;We will get you all&quot;. Grenzfurthner openly addressed this on online platforms and in lectures.

An artistic fake image posted by Grenzfurthner in July 2021 on his Twitter account sparked some controversy on social media and in the news.

Jean Peters reports in his book &quot;Wenn die Hoffnung stirbt, geht&#x27;s trotzdem weiter&quot; (2021, translation from German) about a special form of anti-fascist prank Grenzfurthner staged:
:Austrian artist Johannes Grenzfurthner, who himself has also published on context hacking, mingled in disguise with a Nazi demonstration in Bavaria in the spring of 2005. When cameras passed by, he made the forbidden Hitler salute. When he started doing so, the dam quickly broke; everyone around him joined in. In doing so, he had created media images showing the group as it really was. It turned bizarre when a few of them then approached him and said, &quot;Stop, stop!&quot; which, coming from a Nazi, sounded like a performative peculiarity, &quot;we&#x27;re not allowed to do that here.&quot; Whether over-affirmation or mimicry, the point is to make truly visible what would rather remain hidden behind a facade of self-righteousness.

<text>Tsampa or Tsamba (; ) is a Tibetan and Himalayan staple foodstuff, it is also prominent in parts of northern Nepal. It is a glutinous meal made from roasted flour, usually barley flour and sometimes also wheat flour and flour prepared from tree peony seeds. It is usually mixed with the Tibetan butter tea. It is also eaten in Turkestan and Mongolia, where it is known as &quot;zamba&quot;.

==Preparation==

As the flour has already been roasted &quot;Tsampa&quot; is quite simple to prepare and does not need to be cooked; indeed, it is known as a convenience food and often used by the Tibetans, Sherpas, nomads and other travellers. While traditional tsampa is prepared with tea, sometimes water or beer is used in its place. It may also be prepared as a porridge which is called a &quot;jham-thoo&quot; which is usually sweet and nutty and prepared with Tibetan cheese, butter, tea and sugar. Tsampa is also prepared in a congee with lamb or yak stock to make a congee which is called &quot;tsam-thug&quot;. AndrÃ© Migot described its preparation:
==Cultural significance==
Besides constituting a substantial, arguably predominant part of the Tibetan diet, its prominence also derives from the tradition of throwing pinches of &quot;tsampa&quot; in the air during many Buddhist rituals. It is believed that &quot;tsampa&quot;-throwing actually predates Buddhist beliefs in the area and was originally used as an offering to animistic gods to request their protection. The tradition was consequently incorporated into Buddhism as a &quot;mark of joy and celebration&quot; used at celebratory occasions such as marriages and birthdays. Today it is particularly known in that regard for its use in New Year celebrations, where it is accompanied by chanted verses expressing the desire for good luck in the forthcoming year, for both oneself and others. &quot;Tsampa&quot;-throwing also occurs at most Buddhist funerals, where the action is intended to release the soul of the deceased.

&quot;Tsampa&quot; is used in a number of other ways. Mashes of &quot;tsampa&quot; and cumin are sometimes applied to toothaches or other sore spots. &quot;Tsampa&quot; is also known among Tibetan sportsmen for its ability to provide rapid energy boosts; the roasting of the flour breaks it down to an easily digestible state, allowing the calories therein to be quickly incorporated by the body.

Reflecting its foundational role in Tibetan culture, &quot;Tsampa&quot; is also the name of a Tibetan typeface.

==Political significance==
The phrase &quot;&quot;tsampa&quot;-eater&quot; was used to promote a unified Tibetan identity. Whereas Tibetans speak various dialects, worship in different sects, and live in different regions, all Tibetans were thought to eat &quot;tsampa&quot;. In 1957, the India-based &quot;Tibet Mirror&quot; addressed a letter to &quot;all tsampa-eaters&quot;, encouraging them to participate in what would become the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Recently, with the rise of the Tibetan diaspora, less emphasis has been placed on &quot;tsampa&quot; and more emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism in constructing a unified Tibetan identity.

<text>Parambassis ranga, commonly known as the Indian glassy fish, Indian glassy perch, or Indian X-ray fish, is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish in the Asiatic glassfish family Ambassidae. It is native to an area of South Asia from Pakistan to Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh.

The Indian glassy fish has an extraordinarily transparent body, revealing its bones and internal organs; the male develops a dark edge to the dorsal fin. The fish grows to a maximum overall length of .

It occurs in standing water, especially in impoundments, and it breeds prolifically during the rainy season. The species feeds on crustaceans, annelid worms, and other invertebrates. It is, in turn, prey for larger fish, including snakeheads (family Channidae).

The Indian glassy fish is not important as a food fish for humans, but is very common in the aquarium trade.

Formerly classified as &quot;Chanda ranga,&quot; the species is also known as the Indian glassfish, Indian glass perch, and Siamese glassfish.

==In the aquarium==
Glassfish have been kept in aquarium for many years, but have a reputation for being delicate and difficult to keep. This may be related to a persistent myth that these fish need brackish water. In the wild, they more commonly inhabit fresh water, and in captivity do well in slightly soft to moderately hard dGH 7â19, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline water pH 6.5â7.5. They can tolerate a temperature range of .

These fish swim at the middle and lower levels of the tank, and will take most small live and frozen foods. In general, they tend not to eat dried foods (such as flake).
The fish reproduce by laying the eggs (females) and then the males fertilize the eggs.

===Dyed glassfish===
Indian glassy fish sold to hobbyists have often been &quot;painted&quot;, which involves injecting coloured dye into the fish&#x27;s transparent tissue to make them more attractive to hobbyists. These coloured fish are often called &quot;disco fish&quot;. Inexperienced fishkeepers are often tricked into believing such fish are natural and not told that the process is not painless and causes kidney damage to the fish. 

Fish thus treated have suffered trauma and are susceptible to disease, including &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; infection, fin rot, and the viral disease lymphocystis. The artificial coloration often fades within a short time. Healthy, unpainted specimens may live three to four years in captivity, but such individuals may be difficult to find in some localities.

<text>&quot;Imminent lawless action&quot; is one of several legal standards American courts use to determine whether certain speech is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The standard was first established in 1969 in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio.&quot;

== History ==
&quot;Brandenburg&quot; clarified what constituted a &quot;clear and present danger&quot;, the standard established by &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919), and overruled &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927), which had held that speech that merely advocated violence could be made illegal. Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely. While the precise meaning of &quot;imminent&quot; may be ambiguous in some cases, the court provided later clarification in &quot;Hess v. Indiana&quot; (1973) in which the court found that Hess&#x27;s words were protected under &quot;his rights to free speech&quot;, in part, because his speech &quot;amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time,&quot; and therefore did not meet the imminence requirement.

The two legal prongs that constitute incitement of imminent lawless action are as follows:

: Advocacy of force or criminal activity does not receive First Amendment protections if (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such action.

<text>Popiah (, Teochew Peng&#x27;im: bohâ¸ bianÂ²) is a Fujianese/Teochew-style fresh spring roll filled with an assortment of fresh, dried, and cooked ingredients, eaten during the Qingming Festival and other celebratory occasions. The dish is made by the people and diaspora of Fujian province of China (in Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou), neighbouring Chaoshan district, and by the Teochew and Hoklo diaspora in various regions throughout Southeast Asia and in Taiwan (due to the majority of Taiwanese being Hoklo), The origin of popiah dates back to the 17th century.

==Etymology==
In the Chaoshan dialect and Hokkien language, &quot;popiah&quot; is pronounced as /poÊË©piÃ£Ë¥Ë§/ (), which means &quot;thin flatbread/cake&quot;. Depending on the regions in Fujian, it is also commonly referred to as /lunË©piÃ£Ë¥Ë§/ (), which is the etymological origin of &quot;lumpia&quot; in the Philippines and Indonesia. It is referred to as &quot;rÃ¹nbÇng&quot; () or &quot;bÃ¡obÇng&quot; () in Mandarin, and also as &quot;bÃ³pÃ­juÇn&quot; ().

==Wrapper and fillings==
A &quot;popiah&quot; &quot;skin&quot; () is a soft, thin paper-like crÃªpe or pancake made from wheat flour. The method of producing the wrapper involves making an extremely wet and viscous dough. A ball of this dough is held to the right hand, then quickly &quot;rubbed&quot; (æ¦èé¤ç®, Hokkien: chhat poÌh-piÃ¡â¿ phÃª, literally &quot;to rub a popiah crepe&quot;) against a hot steel plate in a circular fashion, and lifted. Through this process, a very thin layer of the wet dough adheres to the plate and begins to cook. The upper surface of the crÃªpe is then usually cleaned of excess pieces of dough using the dough ball through a dabbing process. When the dough has been cooked to completion, it is peeled off from the hot steel plate before being removed. The rubbing is typically done over two or three plates at once, which allows the baker to continuously produce crepes and gives enough time for each crepe to be properly cooked.
It is eaten in accompaniment with a sweet sauce (often a bean sauce), a blended soy sauce or hoisin sauce or a shrimp paste sauce (è¦è, hae-ko, , ), and optionally with hot chilli sauce before it is filled. The filling is mainly finely grated and steamed or stir-fried turnip, jicama (known locally as &quot;bangkuang&quot;, èå, TÃ¢i-lÃ´: bÃ¢ng-kuang), which has been cooked with a combination of other ingredients such as bean sprouts, French beans, and lettuce leaves, depending on the individual vendor, along with grated carrots, slices of Chinese sausage, thinly sliced fried tofu, chopped peanuts or peanut powder, fried shallots, and shredded omelette. Other common variations of popiah include pork (lightly seasoned and stir-fried), shrimp or crab meat. Seaweed is often included in the Xiamen (Amoy) versions. Some hawkers in Malaysia and Singapore, especially in non-halal settings, will add fried pork lard. As a fresh spring roll, the &quot;popiah&quot; skin itself is not fried.

Two common ways of eating this are holding them like a burrito, which some prefer, while others cut the popiah roll into slices and pick them up with chopsticks. It requires some skill to pick the pieces up with chopsticks. Spoons are seldom provided at the establishments.

==Types==
In mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia there are &quot;&quot;popiah&quot; parties&quot; at home, where the ingredients are laid out and guests make their own &quot;popiah&quot; with proportions of ingredients to their own personal liking.

===Taiwanese===

In Taiwan, &quot;popiah&quot; is called &quot;runbing&quot; () in Mandarin, &quot;jÅ«n-piÃ¡nn(-kauh)&quot; in Taiwanese Hokkien.

The stuffing itself is quite diverse among different places. The basic stuffing includes vegetables that grow in spring, meat and thinly shredded omelette. In some places, they also add noodles, Chinese sausages, stewed vegetables instead of blanched ones, tofu, seafood, sticky rice, and so on.

Furthermore, the way of cooking the stuffing is very different as well. In northern Taiwan, the stuffing is flavoured, stir-fired, sometimes it goes with peanut powder, and the sauce is salty. In southern Taiwan, the popiah stuffing is water blanched without additional seasoning, and flavoured primarily with sugar and peanut powder. For people who live in southern Taiwan, the addition of sufficient sugar is key for popiah. Moreover, some people like to heat or steam the spring roll again after it is made.

Some food stalls serve popiah filled with ice cream. This is a sweet and savory treat - the ice cream is commonly pineapple, peanut and taro flavored, or these three flavors swirled together. The vendor will have a giant block of peanut candy nearby. They will shave this in front of you to create a bed of peanut shavings on the popiah skin. Then the three scoops of ice cream are placed on the bed. It is customary to add a piece of cilantro before the whole thing is wrapped up and handed to you. Some people have dubbed it an ice-cream burrito.

===Southeast Asian===

In Malaysia and Singapore, &quot;popiah&quot; is part of Chinese cuisine of these two countries. However, in both countries, as well as in Brunei, &quot;popiah&quot; (especially the fried variant) is also popular as part of local street food. In Vietnam, &quot;bÃ² bÃ­a&quot; is the Vietnamese variant of popiah, introduced by Teochew immigrants. It is common to see an old Teochew man or woman selling &quot;bÃ² bÃ­a&quot; at their roadside stand. In Cambodian cuisine, &quot;popiah&quot; is known as &quot;num por pia&quot; (). In Thai cuisine, two types of &quot;popia&quot; () are popular: &quot;popia sot&quot; (fresh spring roll) and &quot;popia thot&quot; (deep-fried spring roll). In addition, Thai cuisine has also incorporated the Vietnamese &quot;summer roll&quot; under the name &quot;kuaitiao lui suan&quot; (). While in Burma/Myanmar, it is known as &quot;kawpyan&quot; (áá±á¬áºáá¼áá·áº). Similar foods in other cuisines include the Filipino &quot;lumpiang sariwa&quot; and the Indonesian &quot;Lumpia Basah&quot; spring rolls which are served with peanut sauce, etymologically derived from the Hokkien name Lum Pia. Majority of ethnic Chinese in both countries are of Hokkien origin.

<doc id="1152534" wikidata="Q724545" url="?curid=1152534" title="Davide Gualtieri">
<text>Davide Gualtieri (born 27 April 1971) is a Sammarinese former footballer who played as a forward. He scored the second fastest goal in FIFA World Cup qualification history, against England on 17 November 1993. Gualtieri held the fastest goal record for over 23 years.

In the match, which took place in Bologna, Italy, San Marino had the kick off and the ball was quickly played through the inside right channel. England defender Stuart Pearce attempted a back pass to goalkeeper David Seaman. Pearce&#x27;s pass was under hit, and Gualtieri ran on to touch the ball past Seaman. 

The goal was timed at 8.3 seconds, which remained the fastest World Cup goal scored in either qualifying or the finals, until Christian Benteke scored after 8.1 seconds for Belgium against Gibraltar on 10 October 2016. England took twenty minutes to equalise, but eventually won the match 7â1. It is falsely believed that Gualtieri&#x27;s goal eliminated England from qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, as England needed to win by seven clear goals; however, the result was immaterial as England were also relying on Poland to beat the Netherlands, which they failed to do.

Gualtieri continued to play for the San Marino national team until 2000, when he retired due to injury. He now works as a computer salesman in San Marino. In 2020, he appeared on the TV series &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes: Euro Having a Laugh&quot;, assembling a Sammarinese team to play against a team of 1990s England players once more.

<text>Adam Adami, O.S.B. (1603 or 1610 â 19 February 1663) was a German monk, diplomat and priest.

Born in MÃ¼lheim am Rhein, Adami seems to have made his first studies in Cologne. At the age of 19, he entered the Benedictine abbey of Brauweiler and occupied himself with theology and law studies. In 1633, he received the ordination to priesthood, one year later he became rector of the Benedictine seminary in Cologne, where he also acquired a doctorate in theology. In 1637 he followed a call to the abbey of St. Jacob in Mainz, where he served as prior and acquired a good reputation as a diplomat.

In the following year, Adami was elected to become prior of the monastery of Murhart. Murhart, like many surrounding abbeys, was subject of an administrative dispute between the Diocese of WÃ¼rzburg and the dukes of WÃ¼rttemberg. Adami was chosen because he was expected to be able to best defend the rights of the abbeys in the years to come, during and following the Peace of Westphalia. Therefore he was sent in 1643 as the envoy of the &quot;restituted monasteries and chapels of Swabia&quot; to the peace negotiations.

During the negotiations, his legitimation as envoy was disputed, but he could obtain a second authorisation from the prince-abbot of Korvei. Adami&#x27;s records of the proceedings of the negotiations are today the primary source of information on the Peace of Westphalia. He belonged to &quot;Trimuvirate&quot; of Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg and Johann von Leuchselring to the group of Catholic maximalists against Trauttmansdorff and the Emperor.

From his point of view, the negotiations failed, though.

Later he was sent to Rome by the Prince-elector and Archbishop of Cologne, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria. With a recommendation from the former papal legate Fabio Chigi, Pope Innocent X appointed Adami as titular bishop of Hierapolis. Maximilian Henry also offered him the post as suffragan bishop of Hildesheim out of gratitude. Adami served in Hildesheim until his death there, while publishing several tracts on national law.

<text>T.N.T. is the second studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released only in Australia and New Zealand on 1 December 1975. This was the band&#x27;s first release with bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd, although the last two tracks feature George Young and Tony Currenti, both of whom previously appeared on &quot;High Voltage&quot;.

==Recording==
After the success of the single &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; and the album &quot;High Voltage&quot;, AC/DC returned to Albert Studios in Sydney to record their second LP with producers George Young and Harry Vanda. George was the older brother of guitarists Malcolm Young and Angus Young and had enjoyed his own success in the group the Easybeats. &quot;T.N.T.&quot; marked a change in direction from AC/DC&#x27;s debut album, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, which was released on 17 February 1975; whereas &quot;High Voltage&quot; featured some experimentation with the styles of its songs and had a variety of personnel filling multiple roles, &quot;T.N.T.&quot; saw the band fully embrace the formula for which they would become famous: hard-edged, rhythm and blues-based rock and roll. They also simplified their personnel system and would use it from then on out, which was Angus strictly playing lead guitar, Malcolm Young playing rhythm guitar, and the drummer and bassist being the only ones to play drums and bass guitar respectively on the albums. In Murray Engleheart&#x27;s book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, producer Harry Vanda states, &quot;I suppose there might have been one or two tracks on the first album, a few things that they were experimenting with, which probably later on they wouldn&#x27;t have done anymore. So I suppose you could say that &quot;T.N.T&quot; was the one that really pulled the identity; like, this is AC/DC, there&#x27;s no doubt about it, that&#x27;s who it&#x27;s going to be and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to stay.&quot;

In Clifton Walker&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott&quot;, bassist Mark Evans speaks about the band&#x27;s creative process during this period:
&quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; was edited down from an extended jam by producer George Young and the inclusion of the bagpipes was his idea to add an extra dynamic to the track. Singer Bon Scott had played in a pipe band in his teens, so George suggested he play bagpipes on the song, not realizing that Scott had been a drummer, not a piper. Regardless, Scott â who knew how to play the recorder â learned the instrument and went on to play them on stage with the band up until 1976, when he set the bagpipes down on the corner of the stage and they were destroyed by fans. For the next three years, whenever they played the song live, Angus would play an extended guitar solo. Chanting in &quot;T.N.T.&quot; was also George Young&#x27;s idea, added after he heard Angus ad-libbing the &quot;oi&quot; chant to himself, and suggested he record it.

==Composition==
&quot;T.N.T.&quot; contains some of the band&#x27;s best-known songs, including the title track, &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;, &quot;The Jack&quot;, and &quot;Rocker.&quot; Seven of the album&#x27;s nine songs were written by the Young brothers and Scott, while &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; predated Scott&#x27;s involvement in the band, having previously been recorded as a single with former vocalist Dave Evans. It features a different arrangement and slightly different lyrics from the original version. It also runs almost a minute longer. &quot;School Days&quot; is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song, a major influence on both Young brothers. &quot;High Voltage&quot; was the first song written and recorded for the album, the title inspired by that of the previous album. In 1993, Angus Young shared the origins of the title track with Vic Garbarini of &quot;Guitar For the Practicing Musician&quot;: &quot;I remember sitting home one night before going into the studio and playing around with some chords, and I suddenly thought, let&#x27;s try playing...A...C...D...C. Sounded good. And then I thought AC/DC...power...&quot;High Voltage&quot;! I sang the chorus part to my brother in the studio and he thought it sounded great.&quot; Issued as the first single before the &quot;T.N.T.&quot; sessions began, many fans thought it was from &quot;High Voltage&quot;. Chris Gilbey of Albert Productions later claimed this caused a late surge in that album&#x27;s sales. Lyrically, the LP features Bon Scott chronicling both the good and the bad about the rock and roll lifestyle, warning aspiring musicians that &quot;it&#x27;s harder than it looks&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;) but also defiantly telling the moral majority to &quot;stick your moral standards &#x27;cause it&#x27;s all a dirty lie&quot; (&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Singer&quot;). In 1994, biographer Clifton Walker observed that Bon was &quot;virtually encapsulating his entire life&quot; in both songs. The lyrics of &quot;The Jack,&quot; sometimes titled &quot;(She&#x27;s Got) The Jack,&quot; were developed by Scott, who was inspired by a letter Malcolm Young received during a tour of Adelaide. The letter, from a woman in Melbourne, implied that Malcolm had given her a venereal disease, although he claims that when he got tested, he was clean. Scott&#x27;s original lyrics were far more explicit than those heard on the album, which he deliberately toned down in case the song got played on radio. The bravado-driven &quot;Live Wire,&quot; which was also sexually suggestive, would be the band&#x27;s show-opener for several years. Almost right from the beginning, the band was taken to task in some quarters for their &quot;smutty&quot; lyrics, as Angus acknowledged to &quot;Guitar World&quot;â³s Tom Beaujour in 1998:

I believe that the politically correct term is &quot;sexist.&quot; Intellectuals like to put a tag on it and say, &quot;these guys are out-and-out sexist.&quot; I&#x27;ve always found there&#x27;s a two-sided thing when it comes to lyrics: someone can call a song &quot;Sexy Motherfucker,&quot; and be accepted, and yet we&#x27;ve been writing all songs all these years, and while there may be the rare &quot;fuck&quot; in the lyrics there somewhere, it&#x27;s all been quite clean cut. Still, people just make the assumption that we&#x27;re five guys who&#x27;ve just got our dicks in mind. People have frequently commented that for all the notoriety and things we got involved in, we could have capitalized on our reputation and said, &quot;Oh yeah, we&#x27;re a piece of nasty work.&quot; But why bother?

&quot;T.N.T.&quot; also led to more AC/DC appearances on Australia&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; music program, following those in support of the Australian &quot;High Voltage&quot; album. These appearances included a live performance of the song &quot;T.N.T.&quot;, as well as a music video for &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;. Filmed on 1976, the video featured the band&#x27;s then-current lineup, along with members of the Rats of Tobruk Pipe Band, on the back of a flat-bed truck travelling on Swanston Street in Melbourne. On 2004, Melbourne&#x27;s Corporation Lane was renamed AC/DC Lane as a tribute to AC/DC, with the decision being based in part on this video.

==Releases==
&quot;T.N.T.&quot; was originally released by Albert Productions, and has never been reissued by another label. Furthermore, it is the only Australian AC/DC studio album for which there is no international counterpart. However, seven of its nine songs comprise the international version of &quot;High Voltage&quot;, released in May 1976. The other two, &quot;Rocker&quot; and &quot;School Days&quot;, saw worldwide release as part of &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;&#x27;s international version (1976/1981) and the &quot;Bonfire&quot; box set (1997) respectively. 

Two singles were released from the album â &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; (December 1975) and &quot;T.N.T.&quot; (March 1976). &quot;T.N.T.&quot; was released in a gatefold sleeve, with the inside depicting the various members on mock-ups of police identification cards, listing apparent aliases and partially obscured personal details including birthdates (only Bon Scott&#x27;s is readily visible).

The original 1975 LP release featured longer versions of &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot;, &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;Rocker&quot; compared to the versions heard on later CD releases:

* &quot;Rocker&quot; fades out at 2:52, however on a 1981 LP reissue, the song goes on for a few more seconds before cutting out abruptly at 2:55 as the riff hits its peak (possibly due to the recording tape running out before the song was originally supposed to end).
* &quot;Can I sit next to you girl&quot; originally closed in 4:32 with a guitar solo by Angus Young and Malcolm Young.
* &quot;High Voltage&quot; originally finished with a sustained guitar note followed by a single hit of the snare drum which also serves as a segue that leads directly into &quot;School Days&quot;. This version was retained for the 1986 CD release, however the 1995 remastered CD release contains the version heard on the international &quot;High Voltage&quot; album release, which has the song fade out before hitting the sustained note. This was how the original single release ended.
* The versions of these songs included on the Deluxe Edition of the 2009 box set &quot;Backtracks&quot; are credited as being the original Australian versions. However, the songs still fade out albeit later than their international counterparts instead of keeping the original edits. When AC/DC&#x27;s catalogue (except the Australian releases) became available on iTunes in November 2012, the original uncut versions of &quot;Rocker&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot; finally saw worldwide release on the digital version of &quot;Backtracks&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic calls &quot;T.N.T.&quot; &quot;a stellar album in its own right, and especially crucial in that it marked AC/DC&#x27;s definitive break with their now seemingly heretical glam rock inclinations, in order to embrace the blue collar hard rock that would forever after be their trademark.&quot;

<text>Robert Leo Taylor (July 2, 1924 â June 20, 2020) was an American aviation pioneer who was the founder and president of the Antique Airplane Association Inc. He was also co-founder and Chairman of the Board of the Airpower Museum with which organization he shared ownership of Antique Airfield in Blakesburg, Iowa.

Taylor was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, in July 1924.

For the majority of Taylor&#x27;s life, he was involved in aviation. In 1941 he soloed and then served in both World War II (US Army Air Forces) and the Korean War. He worked as an aircraft mechanic and airport manager in addition to buying and selling airplanes and restoring them.

In 1994, Taylor was inducted into the Iowa Aviation Museum&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame for his establishment of the Antique Airplane Association in 1953 for providing a place and a purpose to fly, to preserve, to share and to promote the early flying machines.

Taylor still resided in Ottumwa during his latter years, where he published a national and international magazine featuring articles and stories about antique airplanes. He died in June 2020 at the age of 95.

<doc id="1152609" wikidata="Q4950576" url="?curid=1152609" title="Heathrow arrival stacks">
<text>Inbound aircraft to London Heathrow Airport typically follow one of a number of Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs). The STARs each terminate at one of four different RNAV waypoints (co-located with VOR navigational aids), and these also define four &quot;stacks&quot; where aircraft can be held, if necessary, until they are cleared to begin their approach to land. Stacks are sections of airspace where inbound aircraft will normally use the pattern closest to their arrival route. They can be visualised as an invisible helix in the sky. Each stack descends in intervals from down to . If these holds become full, aircraft are held at more distant points before being cleared onward to one of the four main holds.

==The stacks==
===Bovingdon===
The Bovingdon stack is for arrivals from the north west. It extends above the village of Bovingdon and the town of Chesham, and uses the RNAV waypoint BNN (co-located with the BNN VOR), which is situated on the former RAF Bovingdon airfield.

===Biggin Hill===
The Biggin Hill stack on the south east edge of Greater London is for arrivals from the south east. It uses the RNAV waypoint BIG (co-located with the BIG VOR), which is situated on London Biggin Hill Airport.

===Lambourne===
The Lambourne stack in Essex is for arrivals from the north east. It uses the RNAV waypoint LAM (co-located with the LAM VOR), which is situated adjacent to Stapleford Aerodrome.

===Ockham===

The Ockham stack in Surrey is for arrivals from the south west. It uses the RNAV waypoint OCK (co-located with the OCK VOR), which is situated on the former Wisley Airfield. During typical easterly operations, the proximity of arrival traffic via OCK requires departures from Heathrow&#x27;s runway 09R towards the Compton VOR (CPT) to follow a non-standard departure procedure.

==Developments==
The arrival procedures are being revised since 2014 to reduce stacking by introducing variable speed limits and alternative holding procedures.

==Incidents==
At 6Â am on 1 December 2003, a major disaster in the stack was narrowly avoided when two planes, carrying a total of 500 passengers, flew within of vertical clearance. An air traffic controller was blamed by a later inquiry for misdirecting traffic when he ordered a United Airlines Boeing 777 into a level of the Bovingdon Hold already occupied by a similar British Airways aircraft.

<doc id="1152622" wikidata="Q545303" url="?curid=1152622" title="Dean Saunders">
<text>Dean Nicholas Saunders (born 21 June 1964) is a Welsh football manager and former professional footballer.

As a player, he was a striker in a career which lasted from 1982 until 2001. He played for Liverpool and Aston Villa in the 1990s, and set a new British transfer record when he joined the former from Derby County. He began at his hometown club Swansea City before also playing for Brighton, Oxford United, Bradford City, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United as well as spells at Galatasaray and Benfica. He was capped 75 times at senior level for Wales between 1986 and 2001, scoring 22 times, making him one of the nation&#x27;s highest-scoring and most-capped players of all time, although Wales never qualified for any major international competitions while Saunders was playing for them.

Following his retirement from playing in 2001, he entered football coaching and then management, firstly of Wrexham and since then of Doncaster Rovers, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Crawley Town and Chesterfield.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Saunders was born in Swansea and began his career with Swansea City, where his father Roy had been a player and coach, signing as an apprentice on leaving school in 1980.

He turned professional in the summer of 1982, after Swansea had finished sixth in their debut season as a First Division club. Swansea were relegated in 1982â83, and Saunders made his debut in the 1983â84 season. A goalless four-game loan spell at local rivals Cardiff City also came in 1984â85, before he signed for Second Division club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a free transfer on 7 August 1985.

===Brighton and Oxford===
The striker was a success at the Goldstone Ground, scoring 14 league goals in his first season. He scored six goals from 30 league games in 1986â87 before a Â£60,000 move took him to the First Division with Oxford United. He was an instant success as his six goals in the final 12 league games secured First Division survival.

He scored 12 goals in 37 games during the 1987â88 season (during which Maurice Evans was dismissed as manager and replaced by Mark Lawrenson) but it was not enough to prevent Oxford from going down in bottom place after three seasons in the top flight.

He began the 1988â89 season still in the Second Division, with manager Lawrenson and chairman Kevin Maxwell agreeing that they would only sell Saunders if Oxford failed to win promotion at the end of the season. However, he was sold to Derby County for Â£1 million on 28 October 1988, prompting Lawrenson to resign in protest over Saunders&#x27; sale.

===Derby County===
Saunders made his Derby County debut on 29 October 1988 against Wimbledon in a First Division fixture at the Baseball Ground in which he scored twice. In his first season at his new club he scored 14Â goals in 30 games to help Derby finish fifth in the 1988â89 First Division table â their highest finish since they were league champions in 1975 â but they were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup due to the ban on English teams in European competition following the Heysel Disaster of 1985. He added 11 league goals to his name in the 1989â90, but Derby slumped to 16th place.

During the 1990â91 season he netted 17Â league goals but Derby still went down in bottom place with just five league wins all season. Their relegation saw most of the country&#x27;s top clubs queue up in their bid to capture Saunders&#x27; services, and Everton were favourites to sign him, and there were also approaches from Aston Villa&#x27;s new manager Ron Atkinson, and Nottingham Forest&#x27;s Brian Clough. Saunders ended up at Liverpool, who paid a then English record fee of Â£2.9 million for Saunders on 19 July 1991 to make him Ian Rush&#x27;s new strike-partner following the departures of David Speedie and Peter Beardsley.

===Liverpool===
In 1991â92, Saunders partnered Rush â who was also his strike partner for Wales â in attack, backed by young Steve McManaman which saw the club win the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history in manager Graeme Souness&#x27; first full season in charge.

Saunders scored 23 goals in all competitions, though just 10 of these were the league where the club only managed a sixth-place finish - one of their lowest positions since their current top flight tenure began in 1962. He became the first Liverpool player to score four goals in a European fixture when he did so during a 6â1 home win over Kuusysi Lahti in the UEFA Cup first round first leg on 18 September 1991 that was their first European fixture after their six-year ban. He also scored twice against FC Tirol in the third round first leg and a hat-trick in the return game.

Saunders finished as the club&#x27;s top scorer for the 1991â92 season.

===Aston Villa===
On 10 September 1992, Saunders became Aston Villa&#x27;s record signing in a Â£2.5 million deal that reunited him with former Liverpool players Steve Staunton and Ray Houghton at Villa Park. He managed six goals in his first four league games including two on his home debut against the club who had sold him; he also scored the winning goal at Anfield later in the season.

Here, he developed a strong partnership with Dalian Atkinson until the latter suffered an injury midway through the season. Linking up with Dwight Yorke, Saunders continued scoring as Villa challenged for the inaugural Premier League title but the team ultimately finished runners-up behind Manchester United. He ended the campaign with 16 goals in total with 12 in the league, one being a 35-yard strike against Ipswich.

Saunders and Villa found goals harder to come by in the league in the following season and he only managed 10, three coming from hat-trick scored against Swindon. He did however manage six more in cup competitions, with his goals against Birmingham City and Tranmere helping Aston Villa reach the 1994 League Cup Final where they beat Manchester United 3â1, as Saunders scored twice to end Villa&#x27;s 12-year wait for a major trophy.

Despite his best goalscoring season for the club with 17 goals, the 1994â95 season saw Villa finish only one place short of relegation â two years after they had come one place short of the league title. At one stage during the campaign Saunders recorded a run of seven goals in six games, including braces against Wimbledon in a 7â1 victory, and Sheffield Wednesday. His final Villa goal came against Leicester City and despite not scoring in his final twelve appearances for the club he was named the Supporters&#x27; Player of the Year.

===Galatasaray===
As part of new Villa manager Brian Little&#x27;s rebuilding programme, which resulted in many players of the Ron Atkinson era being sold, Saunders was off-loaded to Turkish club Galatasaray on 1 July 1995 for Â£2.35 million (a large sum for a 31-year-old player), where he reunited with his former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness. In fact, according to Shelley Webb&#x27;s book &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives Tell Their Tales&quot;, the first Saunders&#x27; wife Helen knew of the move was when she went to Turkey with him one weekend, to find that by Monday he had signed for the Istanbul club and this was her new home.

In the 1996 Turkish Cup final, Saunders scored the only goal of the first-leg before scoring an equalising goal in extra-time of the away leg against rivals FenerbahÃ§e to win the cup for Gala.

===Later career===
Saunders spent one season at Galatasaray, before he returned to the Premier League with Nottingham Forest in 1996 for Â£1.5m. His only season at the City Ground was a disappointment with a shortage of goals which contributed to Forest&#x27;s relegation before joining Sheffield United in Division One. Whilst at Sheffield United he is remembered for an ingenious passage of play which resulted in a cheeky goal for his team. In a game against Port Vale, Saunders chased a long ball down with Vale keeper Paul Musselwhite, Musselwhite won the race and knocked the ball out for a throw in, only for Saunders to quickly pick it up, throw it onto the keeper&#x27;s backside, and then proceed to curl the rebound into the goal from 25 yards.

Saunders remained at Sheffield United for two years before another spell abroad with Benfica (again under Souness) before moving back to the Premier League with newly promoted Bradford City. He remained at Bradford for two years until the end of the 2000â01 season, when Bradford were relegated from the Premier League. It was the eighth time in his career that Saunders had been involved with a club during a season of relegation.

==International career==
Saunders was one of the Wales national team&#x27;s most prolific goalscorers. He made his international debut, aged 21 in a 1â0 friendly win against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 26 March 1986 coming on as a 60th minute substitute for Gordon Davies. The match was also notable for being Jack Charlton&#x27;s first match in charge of the Republic of Ireland and Neville Southall breaking his ankle on a routine cross. He scored 22Â international goals, putting him fourth on the all time Wales list behind Ian Rush, Ivor Allchurch and Trevor Ford. Among his list of goals was the only goal of the game to defeat Brazil in Cardiff in 1991. He won the last of his 75Â caps as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine on 28 March 2001, a few months short of his 37th birthday.

==Coaching career==
After his playing retirement Saunders initially became a coach at Blackburn Rovers working alongside his former manager Graeme Souness. He moved with Souness to Newcastle United in 2004, initially in the role of striker coach, and then later becoming first-team coach. When Souness was sacked on 2 February 2006 due to a run of poor results, his entire backroom team including Saunders were also replaced.

Saunders started the Certificate in Football Management course at the University of Warwick Business School in June 2007 and holds the UEFA Pro Licence coaching badge. In June 2007, he was appointed assistant manager to John Toshack for the Wales national football team, and remained in the role until Toshack&#x27;s departure in September 2010.

==Managerial career==
===Wrexham===
On 2 October 2008, Saunders was appointed as manager of Conference Premier club Wrexham, taking over from Brian Little to become the side&#x27;s fourth manager in 22Â months. He was allowed to combine the role with his position as assistant manager of Wales.

Saunders made several signings in the summer of 2010, and after an uncertain start, the team finished in the play-off positions. They failed to win promotion though, after Luton Town defeated them 5â1 on aggregate in the semi-finals. After the club received a takeover at the conclusion of the season after several years of financial instability, Saunders signed a new contract.

Despite his new deal Saunders remained at Wrexham for only ten matches of the following season, during which he led the team to second place, before he moved to Doncaster Rovers of the Championship.

===Doncaster Rovers===
On 23 September 2011, Saunders was named manager of Doncaster Rovers following their sacking of Sean O&#x27;Driscoll. His first match gave the club their first win of the season and their first in 20 games, when they beat Crystal Palace 1â0. Despite this opening victory a run of poor results saw a section of fans call for Saunders to be sacked as Doncaster remained at the bottom of the league.

His attempts to keep Doncaster in the Championship came to an end on 14 April 2012 as they were relegated following a 4â3 home defeat by Portsmouth at the Keepmoat Stadium, ending their four-year stay in the Championship. In the transfer window Saunders said &quot; I&#x27;m going to try and bring the best to the club (Doncaster Rovers) and I&#x27;m targeting Championship quality&quot;.

On 14 July 2012 Saunders made a brief return to playing as he came off the bench to score in Doncaster&#x27;s 4â2 friendly victory over Cleethorpes Town.

Following their relegation to League One Saunders oversaw a promotion challenge which put the club joint top of the division by early January, but on 6 January 2013 Doncaster gave Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers permission to talk to Saunders with the prospect of him becoming the club&#x27;s new manager.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 7 January 2013 Saunders was confirmed as the new Wolves manager on a one-year rolling contract, succeeding StÃ¥le Solbakken less than 48 hours after his dismissal, with both his assistant manager Brian Carey and fitness coach Mal Purchase at Doncaster also making the move to Molineux. Saunders&#x27; first match brought a 1â1 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 11 January 2013.

Despite announcing that he believed the team could still challenge for promotion, it was not until his tenth game in charge that Wolves recorded a victory. By the final months the team firmly lay in a relegation battle that ultimately proved unsuccessful, with their first relegation to the third tier since 1984â85 being confirmed on the final day of the season with defeat at Brighton.

Saunders stated that he hoped to remain in the job and &quot;sort the club out from top to bottom&quot;, but his contract (as well as his assistant&#x27;s) was terminated three days after relegation was confirmed, following only four months in the job.

===Crawley Town===
On 27 December 2014, Saunders was named as interim manager of Crawley Town after John Gregory stepped down due to health problems.

===Chesterfield===
On 13 May 2015, Saunders was appointed the manager of Chesterfield on a two-year contract following Paul Cook&#x27;s departure for Portsmouth.

His first game in charge bought a 3â1 win at home against Barnsley and other notable results included a 2â1 win at then leaders Walsall in October, a 2â0 win at promotion chasers Millwall and a 4â1 win at FC United of Manchester in the FA Cup.

However, after four consecutive league defeats and dramatic drop in the form and style of play, Chesterfield announced on 28 November 2015 that they had parted company with Saunders following a 4â0 home defeat to Swindon Town, that left them in 16th place.

==Personal life==
Saunders lives in Cheshire, where his closest neighbour was Gary Speed, his former international teammate. Following Speed&#x27;s death, Saunders described himself as &#x27;flabbergasted&#x27; upon hearing the news.

Saunders&#x27; son Callum is a semi-professional footballer. In 2018 Callum Saunders signed a professional contract with Nantwich Town.

In August 2019, Saunders was jailed for 10 weeks, but freed after one day pending an appeal, for refusing to provide a roadside breath test, following reports that he had been driving erratically. The sentence was overturned on appeal, and replaced with a suspended sentence and community work.

<text>William Macdonald Smith (25 June 1939 â 21 August 2024) was a South African science and mathematics teacher who was best known for his maths and science lessons on television. Born in Makhanda (Grahamstown), he is the son of the ichthyologist Margaret Mary Smith and Professor J. L. B. Smith, the renowned chemist and ichthyologist who identified the coelacanth.

==Early life and education==
William Smith was born on 25 June 1939. He attended St. Andrew&#x27;s Prep before matriculating at Union High School in Graaff-Reinet. Smith then went on to study at Rhodes University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and chemistry, followed by an honours degree (&quot;cum laude&quot;) in chemistry at the same institution. Following that, he obtained a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Natal (Pietermaritzburg campus) in only seven months.

During his time at school and university, Smith showed an interest in film and camerawork, scripting, shooting, and producing the 50-minute feature documentary, âThe Garden Route,â in 1960. The film was digitised and relaunched in 2010.

He started working at African Explosives and Chemical Industries (AECI). Deciding that he would rather pursue a teaching career, Smith left the industry and moved to the education sector, where he started &#x27;Star Schools,&#x27; named for the mass-circulation Johannesburg newspaper, The Star, which published material that Smith prepared to support his lessons. The aim of these schools is to provide value-for-money supplementary education with top-class teachers to prepare learners for their matriculation exams. During the next 25 years, Smith became famous throughout South Africa, winning a &#x27;Teacher of the Year&#x27; award in 1991.

Smith ran his first multi-racial school in the 1970s, despite problems with the Apartheid authorities. At that time, education facilities were segregated under legislation such as the Bantu Education Act (1953), and black children were prohibited from attending classes on campuses that had been reserved for whites. Smith, however, never turned any black student away from any class, and made Star Schools more accessible by offering instruction in subjects that werenât adequately covered by the Bantu Education system - such as mathematics and physical science. (Bantu Education was reserved for black learners, while Christian National Education was reserved for whites. Under Apartheid legislation, South Africa had as many as nineteen different education departments).

In 1990, Smith began producing &quot;The Learning Channel&quot; educational television programmes with the financial backing of Hylton Appelbaum, then executive director of the Liberty Life Foundation. As a result of his work on this programme, Smith was voted as one of the top three presenters on South African television in 1998.

==Other achievements==
Smith was also a renowned conservationist and owned the Featherbed Nature Reserve in Knysna, where he lived until the sale of the land and company in 2008. He was also the owner of &#x27;Rivercat Ferries&#x27;, which has several craft that cruise in the Knysna lagoon and out to sea.

He appeared along with Jeremy Mansfield in the popular South African television quiz show, &quot;A Word or 2&quot;. Smith was also a judge for the &quot;Miss South Africa Pageant&quot; in 1998 and 1999.

==Death==
Smith died in Perth, Australia on 21 August 2024, at the age of 85. The cause of death was cancer.

<text>SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd (, until 1934: GmÃ¼nd; Swabian: &quot;Gmáº½áº½d&quot; or &quot;Gmend&quot;) is a city in the eastern part of the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. With a population of around 60,000, the city is the second largest in the Ostalb district and the whole East WÃ¼rttemberg region after Aalen. The city is a &quot;GroÃe Kreisstadt&quot; since 1956, i.e. a chief city under district administration; it was the administrative capital of its own rural district until the local government reorganisation on 1 January 1973.

There are some institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the PÃ¤dagogische Hochschule SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd (University of Education SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd) and the Landesgymnasium fÃ¼r Hochbegabte (State Highschool for gifted children).

SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd was a self-ruling free imperial city from the 13th century until its annexation to WÃ¼rttemberg in 1802.

==Geography==

SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd is situated within the northern foothills of the Swabian Jura Mountains on the Rems river, about east of the state capital Stuttgart. It marks the place where the Josefsbach (Waldstetter-bach) meets the River Rems. The municipal area comprises the localities (&quot;Ortschaften&quot;) of Bargau, Bettringen, Degenfeld, GroÃdeinbach, Herlikofen, Hussenhofen, Lindach, Rechberg, Rehnenhof-Wetzgau, StraÃdorf, and Weiler.

==History==
From about AD 85, the Neckar-Odenwald line was part of the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. The Romans built the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot; to secure this border; i.e., a line of fortifications at regular distances, which included a small &quot;castrum&quot; on the site of the present-day Schirenhof field in SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd. A first major settlement in this area arose around the 2nd century AD, when Roman soldiers were deployed near the Upper Germanic &quot;limes&quot;. From 223 onward, the border lines were assaulted and taken by the Alemanni, who settled down in the areas abandoned by the Romans.

In the 8th century a counterfeit document in the name of Charlemagne, prepared at the Abbey of St Denis near Paris, mentioned a monastic cell called &quot;Gamundias&quot; built by Abbot Fulrad of St Denis. Whether or not this refers to GmÃ¼nd is uncertain. There are no archaeological indications of a cell of this type in GmÃ¼nd.

GmÃ¼nd was first mentioned in an 1162 deed issued at nearby Lorch Abbey, then under the rule of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The self-proclaimed &quot;Stauferstadt&quot; achieved the status of an Imperial City in 1268, which it held until 1802, when it was mediatised to the Electorate of WÃ¼rttemberg.

By the end of the 14th century, the name &quot;Etzel castle&quot; was used for the remains of the Roman fort, which had been built to protect the Neckar-Odenwald border of the Roman Empire. In a Baroque chronicle of the city of SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd, written by the councillor Friedrich Vogt (1623â1674), the &quot;Castle&quot; was mentioned in ancient writings as &quot;Etzel castle&quot;. Even at the time of Vogt, the Roman remains were cheaper than stones from quarry, and these were thus removed to the ground. Only parts of the moat would still be visible.

The demesne officer, wine expert and archaeologist &quot;&quot; (1776â1849), a half brother of the poet Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin, suspected in 1847, that the alleged castle on the Schirenhof manor had probably once been a Roman fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuber2/26&quot;&gt;Hans Ulrich Nuber: &quot;SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd in frÃ¼hgeschichtlicher Zeit&quot;. In: &quot;Geschichte der Stadt SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd&quot;. Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart 1984, , S. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern and scientific excavations took place under the guidance of retired army chief of staff of the WÃ¼rttemberg army, General Eduard von Kallee and by Major Heinrich Steimle in the years 1886 to 1888, i.e. before the Imperial Limes Commission (&quot;Reichslimeskommision&quot;) had been set up. The so-called &quot;Schirenhof Castrum&quot; is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot;.

===U.S. Army===

In March 1955, the 6th Field Artillery Battery arrived from Fort Bragg, NC. This was an Honest John missile battery. A medical battalion and the 567th field artillery battalion (155Â mm self-propelled) of the 9th Infantry Division were already there.

In 1957, The 2 Battalion 16thField Artillery, 4th Armored Division was stationed in Bismark Karserne from 1957 through 1962.

The 3d Battalion, 17th Field Artillery was stationed at Hardt Kaserne until late 1963. The unit&#x27;s mission was reinforcing fire for the 7th Army Light and medium Artillery units. The 8&quot;, M-55 Howitzer (SP) was considered the most accurate weapon in the Army&#x27;s arsenal.

From 1963 to November 1968, the United States Army&#x27;s 56th Field Artillery Group, equipped with Pershing missiles, was headquartered at the Hardt Kaserne along with A and D batteries of the 4th Battalion, 41st Artillery. Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Battery then moved down the hill to the Bismarck Kaserne in November 1968. Family housing and the commissary were across the street from the Hardt Kaserne and overlooked a hill above Bismarck Kaserne. There was a school for military dependents (Kindergarten through eighth grade) within walking distance of the family housing. Teachers at this school were credentialed U.S. educators employed by USAREUR (United States Army Europe). In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were also two local civilians employed to teach the German language (Herr Geis) and German song and dance (Frau KnÃ¶pfle). The Hardt Kaserne, formerly Adolf Hitler Kaserne, which was finished in 1937 and used to train officers for the war, was later home to the 4th Battalion, then in 1972 reactivated as 1st battalion 41st Field Artillery, Headquarters, B, C and Service Batteries, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery 56th Field Artillery Brigade, and A Company, 55th Support Battalion. The brigade command had four additional support units: an aviation company, a signal battalion, an infantry battalion, and a forward support battalion. In 1986 the name of the brigade was changed to 56th Field Artillery Command (Pershing).

===Spring 2016 storm===
On some of the last days of May 2016, a major storm that hit parts of France and southwestern Germany resulted in extensive flooding and damage to SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd and the death of two people in the city.

==Notable structures==

SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd is home to many historically important structures and buildings. These include fortifications and civic and religious buildings.

===City hall===
Sitting at the south end of the Markt Square there lies the city hall. Before becoming the city hall, the city hall was the Debler patrician house and was originally constructed by city architect Johann Michael Keller. In fact, Dominikus Debler, remembered for his work writing the city chronicle, spent his childhood there. However, in 1793 a fire destroyed much of the city between Kornhaus and the KlÃ¶sterle, leaving city leadership concerned for the safety of the old city hall. The Old City Hall (&quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;) was a fachwerk structure reminiscent of Kornhaus that stood between the MarienbrÃ¼nnen and the present-day city hall. Both the initial construction of the building and the conversion of the Debler patrician house into the city hall were undertaken by Johann Michael Keller. The Old City Hall was deconstructed in two weeks and the only remaining artifacts that can be found on the present-day city hall are two of the bells on the bell tower and the clock face. 
===The Holy Cross Minster===

The Holy Cross Minster (&quot;&quot;) is the city&#x27;s main Catholic church. It stands on the site of a former, much smaller romanesque church. It took about 500 years to be completed, though not consecutively. Initial construction began around 1325 under the leadership of an unknown master builder on what was left of the previous romanesque church, the towers of which were still standing. In 1497, the south tower fell onto the north tower, which knocked over the north tower after a bow connecting the two was removed and in 1515, all repair work was finished.

=== The Church of Saint John===
Sitting on the southeast of the Markt Square (only 78 meters northeast of the city hall), there lies a late Romanesque and neo-Romanesque church called the Johanneskirche, or Church of Saint John, also a Catholic church. As the story of its founding goes, Agnes of Hohenstaufen was out hunting in the Remstal one day and she lost her wedding band. She vowed to have a church built at the site where it would be recovered. Later, the ring was found in the antlers of a fallen stag at the site where the church now sits, and accordingly, Agnes commissioned the construction of the church. A cannonball fired during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618â1648) remains visibly lodged in the apse of the church.

==Institutions==
The University of Maryland University College opened a four-year German campus on the Bismarck Kaserne in 1992, which closed in 2002 due to financial difficulties and a lack of students.

In 2004, the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg opened the &quot;Landesgymnasium fÃ¼r Hochbegabte&quot; (State Grammar School for the Highly Gifted) in some of the renovated buildings of the Bismarck Kaserne.

One of the oldest universities in the city is the Hochschule fÃ¼r Gestaltung SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd, a design school established in 1776.

The PÃ¤dagogische Hochschule SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd, also known as the University of Education SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd, was established in 1825 and is one of six universities in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg that were established for the sole purpose of educating upcoming teachers.

The European Academy of Surface Technology (EAST) is a scientific and technological institute on surface finishing and electroplating has its headquarters in the city since 1989. EAST grants annually the SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd Prize for young scientists since 2017, in honor to the local tradition of craftsmanship of precious metals.

==Festivals==
The annual Festival EuropÃ¤ische Kirchenmusik was established in 1989.
The International Shadow Theater Festival was also established in 1989 and takes place every three years. It enchants the audience with artists from all over the world and offers open workshops and a visit to the interactive museum.

==Economy==
Since the 17th century, SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd has been home to producers of gold and silver handicrafts. An almost forgotten craft was the so-called &quot;Silberporzellan&quot;, &quot;Metallporzellan&quot; or &quot;Silberbelagwaren&quot;. Today it is known as Silver overlay and SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd was home of inventor Friedrich Deusch who began to decorate not only porcelain but also glass with this unique technique in the end of 19th century. All the important items which are dealt on the art market today are originated in SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd. The city is also home to the &quot;Forschungsinstitut fÃ¼r Edelmetalle und Metallchemie&quot;, an institute for precious metal work and surface technology.

Other important industries include automotive suppliers like the steering division of Robert Bosch GmbH, manufacturers of machinery and glass, and a large subsidiary of the Swiss toiletries and medicine producer Weleda.

Schleich a producer of handpainted toy figurines and accessories, was founded here by Friedrich Schleich in 1935 and run as a family-owned business until the end of 2006.

<text>Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals is a book on game design by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, published by MIT Press.

==Overview==
Rules of Play expresses the perspective that a theoretical framework for interactive design has not yet been established.

This is not the first time this has been recognized or explored, but is explored in a fresh way in great detail - with one review stating that: &quot;the book manages to bridge the emerging field of game studies methodologies and design theory&quot;.

Another review was also positive: &quot;And if you already are a game designer? In this case, you stand a good chance of becoming a better game designer. Your perception of the internal workings of games will be heightened. You will see structure where before you saw chaos. You will see possibilities where before you saw dead ends. You will see opportunities for meaningful play in every nook and cranny of the game you are working on right now.&quot;

The book is divided into four units, first introducing core concepts, then expanding on these with a detailed discussion of rules, play and culture.

===Unit 1: Core Concepts===

* &quot;Meaningful play&quot; - The authors introduce the concept of meaningful play as the goal of successful game design, providing their own definitions.
* &quot;Design&quot; - The authors discuss definitions of design, and introduce their own. They go on to discuss semiotics, the study of meaning, describing Charles Sanders Peirce&#x27;s semiotic elements.
* &quot;Systems&quot; - The authors introduce four elements all systems share, as defined by Stephen Littlejohn in his textbook &quot;Theories of Human Communication&quot;, and go on to identify each of these elements in the game of chess, when framed as a formal (mathematical), experiential (social), or cultural (representational) system.
* &quot;Interactivity&quot; - The authors connect interactivity with the concepts introduced thus far, and identify various modes of interactivity, citing examples of cognitive, functional, explicit, and &quot;beyond-the-object&quot; interactivity.
* &quot;Defining Games&quot; - The authors discuss the relationship between play and games, highlight existing definitions of a game, and provide their own intentionally narrow definitions of games and game design.
* &quot;Defining Digital Games&quot; - The authors insist that &quot;the underlying properties of games and the core challenges of game design hold true regardless of the medium in which a game manifests,&quot; but they do identify four traits that are particularly strong in digital games: Immediate but narrow interactivity, the manipulation of information, automated complex systems, and networked communication.
* &quot;The Magic Circle&quot; - The authors borrow the term magic circle from the book &quot;Homo Ludens&quot; by Johan Huizinga, using it to describe the space within which a game takes place. They explain how players enter into the magic circle by adopting a &quot;lusory attitude&quot;, another borrowed term, taken from Bernard Suits&#x27; book &quot;Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia&quot;.

===Unit 2: Rules===
* Defining Rules
* Rules on Three Levels
* The Rules of Digital Games
* Games as Emergent Systems
* Games as Systems of Uncertainty
* Games as Information Theory Systems
* Games as Systems of Information
* Games as Cybernetic Systems
* Games as Game Theory Systems
* Games as Systems of Conflict
* Breaking the Rules

===Unit 3: Play===
* Defining Play
* Games as the Play of Experience
* Games as the Play of Pleasure
* Games as the Play of Meaning
* Games as Narrative Play
* Games as the Play of Simulation
* Games as Social Play

===Unit 4: Culture===
* Defining Culture
* Games as Cultural Rhetoric
* Games as Open Culture
* Games as Cultural Resistance
* Games as Cultural Environment

==Guest contributions==
The book is punctuated by guest contributions, including one essay and four commissioned games, each discussed alongside various prototype materials.

* &quot;Foreword: Frank Lantz&quot;
* &quot;Commissioned Essay: Reiner Knizia&quot;
* Unit 1: &quot;Commissioned Game: Richard Garfield&quot;
* Unit 2: &quot;Commissioned Game: Frank Lantz&quot;
* Unit 3: &quot;Commissioned Game: Kira Snyder&quot;
* Unit 4: &quot;Commissioned Game: James Ernest&quot;

<doc id="1152717" wikidata="Q846880" url="?curid=1152717" title="Powerage">
<text>Powerage is the fifth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 5 May 1978 in the United Kingdom and 20 May 1978 in the United States. This was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Cliff Williams on bass guitar, and it was also the first AC/DC album not to have a title track (aside from the Australia-only &quot;High Voltage&quot; album) and the first worldwide not to be released with a different album cover. &quot;Powerage&quot; was re-released in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series.

==Background==
After a 12-date European tour opening for Black Sabbath in April, bassist Mark Evans was fired from AC/DC on 3 May 1977. In the AC/DC memoir &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, former manager Michael Browning states, &quot;I got a call one day from Malcolm and Angus. We were in London, I went to their apartment and they told me they wanted to get rid of Mark. Him and Angus didn&#x27;t see eye to eye. They used to have a sort of tit-for-tat thing going, but nothing that I would have ever thought was going to be gig-threatening.&quot; According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band fame. Browning feared that Pattenden was too old and didn&#x27;t fit the band&#x27;s image, so he instead pushed for Cliff Williams, who had previously played with Home and Bandit. Williams, who could also sing background vocals, passed the audition and was asked to join the band. In a 2011 interview with Joe Bosso that appears on MusicRadar, Evans reflected on his ousting from the group: 
:&quot;With Angus and Malcolm, they were put on this earth to form AC/DC. They&#x27;re committed big-time. And if they feel your commitment is anything less than theirs, well, that&#x27;s a problem. Angus was intense. He was AC/DC 100 percent. His work ethic was unbelievable. When I was with him, he expected everybody to be just like him, which is pretty impossible... At the time, Malcolm said something about them wanting a bass player who could sing, but I think that was a smokescreen. I don&#x27;t know if there was any one reason. It&#x27;s just the way it went down. I felt the distance growing between me and Angus and Malcolm. When I was fired, it wasn&#x27;t so much a surprise as it was a shock. There was a lot of tension in the band at the time. We&#x27;d just been kicked off a Black Sabbath tour, and this was right when a trip to the States was cancelled because the record company rejected the &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; album. So it was a hard period.&quot;

The band finally toured America for the first time in the summer of 1977, focusing on smaller markets at first but eventually playing CBGB in New York City and the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. In December, they played a set in front of a small audience at Atlantic Recording Studios in New York City which was broadcast live over Radio WIOQ in Philadelphia and hosted by Ed Sciaky. The promotional album, &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot;, was later released on the 1997 &quot;Bonfire&quot; box set. In early 1978, the band returned to Sydney to record their next album.

==Recording and composition==

According to the Murray Engleheart book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, several songs that appeared on &quot;Powerage&quot; were started in July 1977 during the band&#x27;s first rehearsals with Williams at Albert Studios, including &quot;Kicked in the Teeth&quot;, &quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot;, an early version of &quot;Touch Too Much&quot; (which later appeared on the follow-up album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;), and possibly &quot;Riff Raff&quot;. The &quot;Powerage&quot; sessions officially got going in January 1978 and stretched over a period of about eight weeks. Atlantic Records executives in the United States complained that the album did not contain a radio-friendly single, so with the first pressings of &quot;Powerage&quot; ready to go in the UK, the band complied and recorded &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot;. The song, which features handclaps and maracas and does not have a traditional guitar solo, was released in Britain at the end of May and reached #24, the best performance yet by an AC/DC single. However, &quot;Powerage&quot; was ultimately the final Bon Scott-era studio album the band recorded with the team of Harry Vanda and George Young, who had produced all of the band&#x27;s albums up to that point (George was the older brother of Angus and Malcolm; he and Vanda had enjoyed their own pop success with the Easybeats in the 1960s), the feeling from Atlantic being that a more commercial producer might do wonders for the band&#x27;s profile in the lucrative American market.

Biographer Clinton Walker wrote in his 1994 Scott memoir &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Gimme a Bullet&#x27; was perhaps Bon&#x27;s most accomplished piece of writing to date, in which his penchant for hardcase metaphors finds even more genuine pathos and humour than it had before.&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s Next to the Moon&quot;, with its allusions to Casey Jones and Clark Kent, as well as the elusive &quot;Gone Shootin&#x27;&quot; and the unapologetic &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; (&quot;I know I ain&#x27;t doin&#x27; much, but doin&#x27; nothin&#x27; means a lot to me&quot;), clearly show that Scott&#x27;s writing, much like the band&#x27;s sound, had evolved from the novelties of the group&#x27;s early albums. &quot;Bon was a street poet â he described it as &#x27;toilet wall&#x27; poetry,&quot; former AC/DC manager Michael Browning explained to Peter Watts of &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2013. &quot;That was unknown. They signed a singer and got a lyricist, as well.&quot; &quot;Sin City&quot;, which the band performed frequently in concert, explores the seductive charms and dangers of Las Vegas, while &quot;Kicked in the Teeth&quot; addresses a two-faced woman with &quot;two-faced lies&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Bass Frontiers&quot;, Cliff Williams recalls the sessions fondly: &quot;The guys had already been in the studio for a while and we went in to do what turned out to be the &quot;Powerage&quot; album. Great work environment. Albert Studios there in Sydney was a great little rock and roll room... Great producers. Obviously a lot of chemistry there being brothers. Just a real fiery, energetic work environment. And we had about three weeks to do it, &#x27;cause that&#x27;s about all the money we had... It was really a tremendous experience.&quot;

==Releases==
Many of AC/DC&#x27;s early albums were altered for release in other markets, and this practice continued with &quot;Powerage&quot;, although it was the first LP to be released nearly simultaneously in both Australian and international markets and the first to use just one cover image for both.

==Reception==

While initial sales were somewhat disappointing, &quot;Powerage&quot; surpassed its predecessor, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, by reaching No. 133 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart in the US, eventually achieving platinum certification. Eddie Van Halen and Rolling Stones&#x27; guitarist Keith Richards have stated that &quot;Powerage&quot; remains their favourite AC/DC record. The album is also Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; guitarist Slash and Aerosmith&#x27;s guitarist Joe Perry&#x27;s favourite album by the band, citing it as a major influence. The album has remained a favourite of Malcolm Young, who was quoted in &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot; as saying, &quot;I know a lot of people respect it. A lot of real rock and roll AC/DC fans, the real pure rock and roll guys. I think that&#x27;s the most under-rated album of them all.&quot; It&#x27;s also drummer Phil Rudd&#x27;s favorite record the band did with Bon Scott.

The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; called AC/DC &quot;another late &#x27;70s boogie band making strides toward commercial clout [who] pumps out heavy metal with a reasonable amount of panache&quot;. The &quot;Cheshire Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;the LP captures better than ever the fresh, aggressive style, the compelling high voltage rock&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; determined that the band &quot;were our first punk rockers, but thank heaven they are not our best or last... They have been emulated and surpassed by their students&quot;.

AllMusic gives &quot;Powerage&quot; a rating of three and a half out of five stars, stating that while &quot;it is the most uneven of&quot; AC/DC&#x27;s 1970s material, the album still contained a &quot;few genuine classics&quot;, specifically mentioning &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; and &quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot;. Edwin Faust of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; considers &quot;Powerage&quot; &quot;AC/DC&#x27;s best album... because it isn&#x27;t simply about sex, drinking and tongue-in-cheek Satanism&quot;, but shows a band &quot;growing up&quot;. In 1994, Bon Scott biographer Clinton Walker opined in his book &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; that &quot;altogether, &quot;Powerage&quot; just seemed to lack the uncompromising coherence and relentless body and soul that was its predecessor&#x27;s greatness.&quot; Band biographer Jesse Fink cites the album as containing &quot;their best ever collection of songs&quot; and deems it &quot;a high point creatively for the three Youngs, an album arguably superior to the commercially successful Mutt Lange circuitbreakers that followed, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot;.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Powerage&quot; was ranked number 325 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 26 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Original European LP release===

Notes
*Initial editions of the European (UK) LP release featured a different mix of the album. It had a &#x27;harder&#x27; sound than the later version, with small variations in vocals, guitar tracks, or both, and occasionally extra sections and longer or shorter fades. Some versions omitted &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot; from the track list, but all included &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;, albeit in a different sequence than on subsequent pressings. For vinyl variations containing &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot;, the single version was used, with &quot;Riff Raff&quot; having a fade-out to accommodate the extra time on Side A. The bluesy coda on &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; is also excluded from this version. UK cassette versions had this mix, with the single version of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot; and no fade on &quot;Riff Raff&quot;, until the 1994 remasters.
*The album was later remixed for the American market, with the new mix replacing the original European mix, and becoming the global standard. This mix is still used on all AC/DC &quot;Powerage&quot; CD releases today.

===Australian/US and all CD releases===

Notes
*Some cassette copies, such as the original Canadian issue, had an alternate track listing. For example, &quot;Sin City&quot; was the first song on side 1, while &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot; was the first song on side 2. All other tracks appear in the order of the original Australian/US release.

==Personnel==
===AC/DC===
*Bon Scott â lead vocals
*Angus Young â lead guitar
*Malcolm Young â rhythm guitar, backing vocals
*Cliff Williams â bass guitar, backing vocals (all tracks except &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;)
*Phil Rudd â drums

===Additional personnel===
*Mark Evans â bass guitar (on &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;)

Note

&quot;The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC&quot; book claims that George Young played bass on all tracks, but Cliff Williams denied this in a 2020 interview.

===Production===
*Harry Vanda â producer
*George Young â producer
*Mark Opitz â engineer
*Michael A. Browning â management

In 2009, she helped design and launch Quest to Learn (Q2L), a public school in Manhattan, New York City, and later participated in developing ChicagoQuest, a charter school in Chicago.

Salen&#x27;s work has involved the development of slow games, online games, mobile games, and big games, both commercially and institutionally.

==Education==
Salen graduated from the University of Texas in 1990 with a B.A. in Fine Arts. She holds a Masters of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from the Rhode Island School of Design. At RISD, she studied semiotics with Tom Ockerse, who focused on the work of Charles Sanders Peirce. She also worked with designers Jan van Toorn of the Netherlands, Michael Rock, and Sharon Poggenpohl. She has an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Bank Street College of Education.

==Early career==
2001â2003

In 2001, Salen started to work at gameLab, where she still serves as a member of the advisory board as of 2010. In 2002, Creative Time in New York hired Salen to develop the curriculum and workshops for the Blur Conference. From 2002â2003, she was a writer and animator for music videos for the band &quot;Zero7&quot;, which had extended play on MYV, MTV and VH1. Also from 2002â2003, Salen was asked to design the &quot;Big Urban Game&quot; (BUG), a citywide multiplayer game which was to be played by the residents of Minneapolis and St.Paul in Minnesota as part of the Twin Cities Design Celebration.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center engaged Salen to co-curate with Graham Leggatt, the director of the society, &quot;Game Engine&quot;, an evening of programming for the New York Video Festival in 2003. In that same year, Salen started writing for &quot;RES Magazine&quot;, which focuses on film, design, culture, art and music; She continued as a contributor until 2006.

Also in 2003, Salen worked as part of a research team to create and design an interactive, animated storytelling experience that was to be distributed through Xbox Live!

2004â2006
In 2004, the Hewlett Foundation took on Salen as the co-director for the Games to Learn Symposium. She was also a consultant for the Digital Kids initiative through the MacArthur Foundation, and served as a game designer for a large motion capture game called &quot;Squidball&quot; that was developed with the Media Research Lab at New York University. In 2004, the Comtech Group (COGO) hired Salen as a consultant for a mobile phone game, and for their online world. The MSN division of Microsoft engaged Salen as a consultant for the redesign of the website in 2004. ATTAP, a group devoted to new web technologies, used Salen as an interactive game designer for their new tools. Salen was also involved in 2005 as a game design consultant with The Rapunzel Project to teach girls computer code. The Buckminster Fuller Institute partnered with the Game Culture &amp; Technology Lab at the University of California, Irvine to create a spaceship earth game, which Salen also worked on in 2005.

From 2004â2006, Mememe Productions in Melbourne, Australia, had Salen design a game for a children&#x27;s television show and for their online community site, while from 2005-2006 she worked on the ISEA2006 Symposium in San Jose, California. This was presented by CADRE Interactive City residency. From 2003 until 2006, Salen was the Director of Graduate Students for the Design and Technology Program at Parsons The New School for Design. Salen is currently faculty at DePaul University&#x27;s College of Computing and Digital Media in Chicago, USA.

==Early projects==
Karaoke Ice

Salen worked on this project alongside Nancy Nowacek and Marina Zurkow in August 2006. The project transformed an ice cream truck into a mobile karaoke unit which roamed the streets of San Jose, California, inviting people towards it with free popsicles. Everyone and anyone was invited to participate in a live karaoke session which would be recorded to be played over loudspeakers later. The songs that were available to sing included &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; by Outkast, &quot;These Boots are Made for Walking&quot; by Nancy Sinatra, and &quot;R.E.S.P.E.C.T.&quot; by Aretha Franklin.

Big Urban Game

Along with Frank Lantz and Nick Fortugno, Salen was asked to help design this large-scale urban game for part of the Twin Cities Design Celebration. All residents were encouraged to participate in the race, the goal of which was to move a 25-foot high inflatable game piece through a route throughout the Twin Cities, hitting several &quot;checkpoints.&quot; Salen created this game to engage a large community with culture and with each other, in an effort to make the residents more aware of urban design.

Waking Life

Salen worked as an animator for this critically acclaimed feature film, directed by Richard Linklater. The film explores topics such as free will, determinism, dreams and the nature of reality.

==Recent projects==

Institute of Play

Salen is the Executive Director of Institute of Play, an organization that promotes games as a learning tool for the 21st century. Institute of Play has used games, play and the principles that underlie them to design schools, programs, games, events, digital platforms and products. Some projects Institute of Play has produced include Quest to Learn, SMALLab (Situated Multimedia Art Learning Lab) Games, Mobile Quest summer camp, and Gamestar Mechanic Strategy Guide. Institute of Play also produced the video game design lab GlassLab, which is developing game-based assessments in partnership with Electronic Arts and Entertainment Software Foundation.
Quest to Learn (Q2L)

Salen is a designer of Quest to Learn, a public school in Manhattan, New York City created out of a collaboration between Institute of Play and the New York City Department of Education, with backing from the MacArthur Foundation and support from New Visions for Public Schools. The school began in the 2009â2010 school year with one sixth grade class, and will add a new grade every year until 2015, when it will be a fully functioning combined middle and high school encompassing grades 6-12. It is located in the Bayard Rustin Educational Complex in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

Q2L&#x27;s standards-based curriculum is developed collaboratively by teachers, game designers, and curriculum designers. Curriculum design mimics the design principles of games by framing every piece of the curriculum as a mission that involves game strategies like collaboration, role-playing and simulation. The school encourages hands-on problem solving, and is designed to promote learning of 21st Century Skills many experts say are necessary for college and career success, such as systems thinking, collaboration, and digital literacy. Not only do students play games in the classrooms, they learn to make them in order to demonstrate their systems thinking skills.

Embodied play

One of Salen&#x27;s current projects is a collaboration with David Birchfield and Mina Glenberg-Johnson from Arizona State University. It focuses on &quot;embodied play in mixed reality environments.&quot;

Connected Camps

Another of Salen&#x27;s current projects is connected camps. She is co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Connected Camps.

<doc id="1152734" wikidata="Q278070" url="?curid=1152734" title="Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt">
<text>The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (), also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the  (&quot;Snowy Mountain Range&quot;), is an active volcanic belt that covers central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.

==History==
The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt spans across central-southern Mexico from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico between 18Â°30&#x27;N and 21Â°30&#x27;N, resting on the southern edge of the North American plate.
This approximately 1000 kilometer long, 90â230Â km broad structure is an eastâwest, active, continental volcanic arc; encompassing an area of approximately 160,000Â km2. Over several million years, the subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates beneath the North American plate along the northern end of the Middle America Trench formed the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.
The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a unique volcanic belt; it is not parallel to the Middle American Trench, and many of the main stratovolcanoes are positioned obliquely to the general position of the arc. In addition to the physiographic complexities, igneous compositions varyâdominant subduction-related products contrast with intraplate geo-chemical signatures. The many intriguing aspects of the belt have spurred several hypotheses based on a typical subduction scenario: intra-plate leaky transform faults, mantle plumes, continental rifting, and jump of the eastward Pacific Rise. These features are partially related to the reactivation of early fault systems during the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt&#x27;s evolution. The main brittle fault system&#x27;s geometry, kinematics, and age define a complex array of what could be multiple factors affecting the deformation of the belt. It exhibits many volcanic features, not limited to large stratovolcanoes, including monogenetic volcano cones, shield volcanoes, lava dome complexes, and major calderas.

==Geologic framework==

Prior to the formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, an older, but related volcanic belt, the Sierra Madre Occidental occupied the area. Resuming in the Eocene, post-Laramide deformation, subduction related volcanism formed the Sierra Madre Occidental silic volcanic arc at a paleo-subduction zone off the coast of Baja California, before the peninsula rifted away.
From the Late Eocene to the Middle Miocene, counterclockwise rotation of the volcanic arc transitioned the once active Sierra Madre Occidental to a now active Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. By the Middle Miocene, the transition from the silicic to more mafic compositions was complete, and can be considered the beginning of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Due to the orthogonal orientation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in relation to the trend of Mexican tectonic provinces, its pre-Cretaceous basement is highly heterogeneous. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt east of 101Â°W rests upon Precambrian terranes, assembled into the Oaxaquia microcontinent and on the Paleozoic Mixteco terrane. West of 101Â°W, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt resides on top of the Guerro composite terraneâa make up of Jurassic to Cretaceous marine marginal arcs, which are built on TriassicâEarly Jurassic siliclastic turbidites. Assemblage of these basement rocks results with a thickness of 50â55Â km east of 101Â°W and 35â40Â km west of 101Â°W.

==Plate evolution==
The subducting plates originated from the breakup of the Farallon plate at approximately 23 Ma, which created two plates at equatorial latitudes, the Cocos Plate and southern Nazca plate. The Rivera Plate was the last fragment detached from the Cocos Plate, becoming a microplate at around 10 Ma. This small plate is bounded by the Rivera fracture zone, the East Pacific Rise, the Tamayo fracture zone, and the Middle American Trench. The larger Cocos Plate is bordered by the North American Plate (NAM) and the Caribbean plate to the northeast, the Pacific plate to the west, and to the south by the Nazca Plate. The Cocos and Rivera are relatively young oceanic plates (25 and 10 Ma) that are subducting along the Middle American Trench at different convergence rates (Rivera = ~30Â mm/yr and the Cocos = ~ 50â90Â mm/yr). Commonly found subduction related rocks such as calc-alkaline rocks volumetrically occupy a majority of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt but smaller volumes of intraplate-like lavas, potassium rich rocks, and adakites are associated with the area. Middle Miocene adakitic (more felsic) rocks are found furthest from the trench and along the volcanic front of the central Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during the Pliocene-Quaternary. It has been suggested that slab melting contributed to the adakitic imprint on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, prompted by the prolonged flat subduction of the Cocos plate.

==Belt evolution==

===Formation===

# From the early to mid Miocene ~20 to 8 Ma, the initial Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt volcanic arc consisted of intermediate effusive volcanism, producing andesitic and dacitic polygenetic volcanoes extending from western Michoacan (longitude 102Â°W) to the Palma Sola area (longitude 98Â°30&#x27;). The plate boundary geometry and sub-horizontal subducting slab&#x27;s thermal structure are the controlling factors for initial arc volcanism. Magmatism migrated away from the trench, moving northeast towards the Gulf of Mexicoâgiving the arc its characteristic E-W orientation, the inland push of the arc showed progressively drier melting, and eventually slab melting began to occurâsuggesting flattening of the subducted slab. The oldest rocks of this age may be exposed near the modern volcanic front, in Central Mexico.
# A Late Miocene ~11 Ma eastward traveling pulse of mafic volcanism swept across the whole of central Mexico, north of the previously formed arc, ending ~ 3 Ma. The onset of the mafic lavas indicates lateral propagation of slab tear, prompted by the end of subduction beneath Baja California, allowing the influx of asthenosphere into the mantle wedge. This volcanism created basaltic plateaus through fissures, or less commonly, small shield volcanoes and lava cones, with diminishing lava volume eastward.
# West of 103Â°W, silicic volcanism between 7.5 and 3.0 Ma became bimodal (mafic-silicic) in the early Pliocene, creating large dome complexes and ignimbrites, and marked the beginning of trenchward migration of volcanism. East of 101Â°W dome complexes, lava flows, and large calderas that produced significant quantities of ignimbrites (&gt;50Â km3) of dacitic to rhyolitic composition can be found dating between 7.5 and 6 Ma. There is an absence of silicic volcanism between these regions during the whole Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt history. Since the late Miocene, silicic volcanism migrated trenchward over 200Â km in the eastern sector (east of 101Â°W) and 100Â km in the western sector (West of 103Â°W).
# Since the late Pliocene, the style and composition of volcanism in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate-like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic peralkaline rocks. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by flux and slab melting and a rear belt characterized by the differentiated rocks stated previously. Absent since ~9 Ma, stratovolcanoes began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100Â km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all stratovolcanoes are found within the volcanic front. One exception to the location of these stratovolcanoes is the Colima volcanic complex, which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In addition to stratovolcanoes, monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the MichoacÃ¡nâGuanajuato volcanic field.

===Cause of flat slab subduction===
Flat slab subduction can commonly be explained by oceanic plateau subduction and a fast overriding plate. Central Mexico&#x27;s flat subduction is not evident. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt&#x27;s flat slab is confined between ~101Â°W and 96Â°W; this region may be explained by thicker continental crust. Existence of thick strong crust combined with decreasing fluid input contributed to narrowing the asthenospheric wedge, increasing viscosity and suction forces, which led to flat subductionâpreventing the oceanic plate from entering the mantle.

==Geography==

===Region===
From the west, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt runs from Colima and Jalisco east through northern MichoacÃ¡n, southern Guanajuato, southern QuerÃ©taro, MÃ©xico State, southern Hidalgo, the Distrito Federal, northern Morelos, Puebla, and Tlaxcala, to central Veracruz.

The Mexican Plateau lies to the north, bounded by the Sierra Madre Occidental to the west and Sierra Madre Oriental to the east. The Cofre de Perote and Pico de Orizaba volcanoes, in Puebla and Veracruz, mark the meeting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt with the Sierra Madre Oriental. To the south, the basin of the Balsas River lies between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur. This area is also a distinct physiographic province of the larger Sierra Madre System physiographic division.

The Sierra de Ajusco-Chichinauhtzin also forms part of the Belt.

===Peaks===

The highest point, also the highest point in Mexico, is Pico de Orizaba () also known as CitlaltÃ©petl, located at . This, and several of the other high peaks, are active or dormant volcanoes.

Other notable volcanoes in the range include (from west to east) Nevado de Colima (), ParÃ­cutin (), Nevado de Toluca (), PopocatÃ©petl (), IztaccÃ­huatl (), Matlalcueitl () Cofre de Perote () and Sierra Negra, a companion of the Pico de Orizaba ().

==Ecology==
The mountains are home to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, one of the Mesoamerican pine-oak forests sub-ecoregions.

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has many endemic species, including the Transvolcanic jay (&quot;Aphelocoma ultramarina&quot;).

Volcanic ash make soils in the region very fertile, which (especially coupled with elevation making tropical climate milder) has led to high human population densities in the belt that now sometimes strain the environment.

<text>Kuchum Khan (Turki and , Siberian Tatar: &quot;KÃ¶Ã§Ã¶m; ÐÓ©ÑÓ©Ð¼&quot;, Russian: &quot;ÐÑÑÑÐ¼&quot;; died c. 1601) was the last Khan of Siberia who ruled from 1563 to 1598.

Kuchum Khan&#x27;s attempt to spread Islam and his cross-border raids met with vigorous opposition from the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible (reigned 1547â1584), who sent a force of Cossacks to confront him head-on (c. 1580). Kuchum is particularly noted for the vigorous resistance he offered to the Russian invaders.

==Background==
Kuchum was the son of prince Murtaza from the Shayban dynasty (ÅÃ¤yban) and a descendant of Hadji Muhammad. In 1554, he contested the throne of the Siberia Khanate against the incumbent brothers Yadegar (YÃ¤degÃ¤r) and Bekbulat, who were both vassals of Russia. In 1563, Yadegar was defeated and Kuchum assumed the throne. In 1573, Kuchum conducted a raid on Perm. It was this and other minor raids which prompted the Tsar of Russia to support a Cossack invasion of Siberia.

==War with the Muscovy==

In 1582, the Siberia Khanate was attacked by the Cossack ataman Yermak, who defeated Kuchum&#x27;s forces and captured the capital Qashliq. Kuchum retreated into the steppes, and over the next few years regrouped his forces. He suddenly attacked Yermak on August 6, 1584, in the dead of night, and killed Yermak and most of his army; regaining control of the now-ruined Qashliq. Kuchum attempted to unite the rival factions within the khanate nobility but met with resistance. After an unsuccessful attempt on his life by Qarachi Sayet Khan (SÃ¤yet), Kuchum was forced to move his horde to the steppe south of the Irtysh river. There he attempted to establish a new khanate, engaging in war against Russian governors.

In 1590 Kuchum raided the Tatars around Tobolsk who were paying yasak to the Russians. In 1591 Koltsov caught Kuchum on the Ishym River and captured two of his wives and his son Abdul-Khair who was later given estates in Russia. In 1594 the fort at Tara was built in part to control Kuchum who was in the area. In 1595 Kuchum&#x27;s followers were raided on the upper Irtysh. In 1597 Kuchum asked for negotiations and the Tsar and Abdul-Khair wrote from Russia offering estates in Russia in return for surrender. Before September 1598 Andrey Voyeykov caught a large group of his followers at a place called Ub Lake and later caught Kuchum on the Ob River. Kuchum fled, but the Russians killed two of his sons and captured five other sons, eight wives and eight daughters. A Muslim cleric was sent to negotiate. Kuchum replied, describing himself as deaf and blind and without subsistence and said that he had not submitted before and would not submit now. This was his last contact with the Russians. He is believed to have died c. 1605 in Bukhara. In 1620 his son Ishim-khan married a daughter of Kho Orluk who was then leading his people from Dzugharia to the Volga.

Kuchum is portrayed in numerous Tatar and Russian songs and legends. His descendants remained in Muscovy, eventually assuming the title of Sibirsky.

In 1591, Kuchum&#x27;s son, Abul Khayir was the first of his dynasty to convert to Christianity. His conversion was followed by the conversion of his entire family who eventually assimilated into the Russian nobility. For instance, 
although Abul Khayir&#x27;s son was known as Vasily Abulgairovich, his grandson&#x27;s name, Roman Vasilyevich, could no longer be distinguished from a native Russian name.

In 1686, the tsar decreed that the dynasties of the ruler of Imeretia in the Caucasus along with the Tatar princes of Siberia and Kasimov were to be added into the Genealogical Book of the Russian nobility.

In 1661, a man who was said to be a descendant of Kuchum fought the Russians in Bashkiria. In 1739, during the Bashkir War, some said Karasakal to be a Kuchumid.

<text>John Baptiste Bernadou (November 14, 1858 â October 2, 1908) was an officer in the United States Navy during the SpanishâAmerican War. Born in Philadelphia, Bernadou graduated from the Naval Academy in 1880. He was promoted ten numbers for gallantry in action while commanding at the First and Second Battle of Cardenas, Cuba, from May 8 to May 11, 1898. John Baptiste Bernadou died at the Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1908, and is buried with his wife Florence Whiting in Arlington National Cemetery Section S. Div Site 2004 W.S

==Background==
John Baptiste Bernadouâborn on November 14, 1858, in Philadelphiaâwas appointed to the United States Naval Academy on September 12, 1876, and graduated with the class of 1880. After a short tour of shore duty at Claymont, Delaware, he served at sea in the screw sloop until 1882. Warranted midshipman on June 2 of that year, he was assigned to the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C., and was commissioned ensign (junior grade) on March 3, 1883. Between 1883 and 1885, Bernadou served on special duty in Korea. He was one of 18 naval officers serving with the Smithsonian Institution. His travels to Korea were to investigate that country&#x27;s economic and strategic potential. On June 26, 1884, he was promoted to ensign.

==Pre-SpanishâAmerican War duties==
Upon returning to the United States, Bernadou was assigned to the recently revitalized Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). There, he went to work studying world economic conditions with a particular emphasis on the world&#x27;s supply of nickel ore. The importance of that commodity resulted from the navy&#x27;s adoption of nickel-processed steel for its new ship construction. He also collected information on foreign seaports, assisting in the writing of a book on international ports and coaling stations. His facility with foreign languages put him in an ideal position to translate articles of value to ONI from French, German, Russian, Swedish, Spanish, and other languages.

Between February 1891 and May 1893, he served in the cruiser . On July 1, 1892, he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade). He took a leave of absence because of illness from May to July 1893 and then returned to sea in (Gunboat No. 4). In that warship, he made a cruise to European and Mediterranean waters, there transferring to the protected cruiser .

In September 1894, Bernadou began three years of service at the Naval Torpedo Station located at Newport, Rhode Island, where he continued the work of Charles Munroe developing a satisfactory smokeless powder for naval artillery. While in that assignment, he was promoted to lieutenant in June 1896. In 1897 he patented a nitrocellulose powder colloided with ether and alcohol. The Navy licensed or sold patents for this formulation to DuPont and the California Powder Works while retaining manufacturing rights for the Naval Powder Factory, Indian Head, Maryland constructed in 1900. The United States Army adopted Bernadou&#x27;s formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal. In December 1897, Bernadou went to the Norfolk Navy Yard where he put (Torpedo Boat No. 5) into commission on the 29th as her first commanding officer.

==SpanishâAmerican War==
War with Spain erupted late in April 1898, and Bernadou was soon patrolling the northern coast of Cuba in Winslow. On May 8, Barnadou blockaded the port of Cardenas with USS &quot;Machias&quot;. That day, &quot;Machias&quot; left for a patrol leaving only the &quot;Winslow&quot; for blockading. Three Spanish gunboats which were trapped in the port decided to sortie and attempt to lift the blockade, in the ensuing battle, &quot;Winslow&quot; damaged all three Spanish vessels and sent them back into port. On May 11, he took &quot;Winslow&quot; to take on coal from one of the larger warships there. Upon reporting to the commanding officer of (Gunboat No. 8), he received orders to take Winslow into the bay at Cardenas and scout for mines. &quot;Winslow&quot; and the revenue cutter &quot;Hudson&quot; searched the harbor entrance but found no mines. They rejoined &quot;Wilmington&quot; about noon to make their report. &quot;Wilmington&#x27;s&quot; commanding officer decided to take the three warships into the bay in search of the three Spanish gunboats reported there. Bernadou&#x27;s command marked shoal water to Wilmington&#x27;s portside during the entry. Upon reaching a point about 3,000 yards from the city, a lookout spied a small, gray steamer moored alongside the wharf. Bernadou then received orders to move his ship in closer to determine whether or not the ship was an enemy warship.

At around 1335, his warship reached a point about 1,500 yards from the object of his interest when a white puff of smoke announced the opening of an artillery duel that would last an hour and 20 minutes. Bernadou responded with &quot;Winslow&#x27;s&quot; one pounder guns, and then enemy batteries ashore joined the deadly contest. Bernadou&#x27;s little ship bore the brunt of the Spanish fury, and she soon received a number of direct hits. The first shell to strike her destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Bernadou&#x27;s crew tried to rig some type of auxiliary steering gear while he steered her with the propellers in an attempt to keep her bow gun unmasked and to present the enemy with as small a target as possible. All at once, however, &quot;Winslow&quot; swung broadside to the shore batteries. Quickly, a shot knocked out her port main engine. Bernadou then tried to maneuver his warship with the remaining engine to evade Spanish fire and to keep his guns in action. At some point before that time, a shell burst on the top of the forward conning tower; and a fragment from it struck Bernadou in the thigh.

Almost simultaneously, &quot;Wilmington&quot; and &quot;Hudson&quot; brought their larger guns to bear on the Spanish shore batteries. The Spanish gunboat received fatal hits, and her crew abandoned her, while the shore batteries slackened fire. Bernadou requested &quot;Hudson&quot; to tow his all-but-disabled torpedo boat out of action. A towline was passed between the two ships, but it soon parted. Spanish shore batteries continued their fire, and one shell burst near the after engine room hatch killing four of the crew and Ens. Worth Bagley, the only American naval officer killed by enemy action in the SpanishâAmerican War.

The towline was finally rerigged, and &quot;Winslow&quot;, badly damaged, was towed clear of the action. Bernadou relinquished command of the ship to Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate George P. Brady and went over to &quot;Wilmington&quot; with the rest of the wounded. For his gallantry at Cardenas, Bernadou received a commendation and advancement (10 numbers) in seniority.

==Post war==
After recovering from his wounds, Bernadou returned to duty at the Bureau of Ordnance where he served from late 1898 until sometime in 1899. No doubt, he resumed the work on perfecting smokeless gunpowder that he had performed previously at Newport, Rhode Island. In 1899, he returned to sea in (Battleship No. 1). In 1900, he transferred briefly to newly commissioned (Battleship No. 6) before joining the training ship . He made two cruises to Mediterranean waters and served briefly on the South Atlantic Station. On February 9, 1902, probably while still assigned to &quot;Dixie&quot;, Bernadou was promoted to lieutenant commander. Later that year, he began another tour of duty with ONI in Washington, D.C. That assignment lasted until 1904 when he returned to sea as executive officer of &quot;Kearsarge&quot; (Battleship No. 5). He served in that billet until sometime early in 1906. After a brief tour of duty at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, Bernadou went to Europe to serve as naval attachÃ© in Rome and Vienna. On December 11, 1906, while in Europe, Bernadou was promoted to commander. He remained on diplomatic duty until sometime in mid 1908 when complications caused by the wound he received at Cardenas forced him to return home. Bernadou died at the Naval Hospital, Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1908. Three days later, he was buried with full military honors in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia.

<text>The IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services. Historically, mobile phones have provided voice call services over a circuit-switched-style network, rather than strictly over an IP packet-switched network. Various voice over IP technologies are available on smartphones; IMS provides a standard protocol across vendors.

IMS was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as a part of the vision for evolving mobile networks beyond GSM. Its original formulation (3GPP Rel-5) represented an approach for delivering Internet services over GPRS. This vision was later updated by 3GPP, 3GPP2 and ETSI TISPAN by requiring support of networks other than GPRS, such as Wireless LAN, CDMA2000 and fixed lines.

IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily map into greater reduced cost and complexity.

Alternative and overlapping technologies for access and provisioning of services across wired and wireless networks include combinations of Generic Access Network, softswitches and &quot;naked&quot; SIP.

Since it is becoming increasingly easier to access content and contacts using mechanisms outside the control of traditional wireless/fixed operators, the interest of IMS is being challenged.

Examples of global standards based on IMS are MMTel which is the basis for Voice over LTE (VoLTE), Wi-Fi Calling (VoWIFI), Video over LTE (ViLTE), SMS/MMS over WiFi and LTE, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) over LTE, and Rich Communication Services (RCS), which is also known as joyn or Advanced Messaging, and now RCS is operator&#x27;s implementation. RCS also further added Presence/EAB (enhanced address book) functionality.

== History ==
*IMS was defined by an industry forum called 3G.IP, formed in 1999. 3G.IP developed the initial IMS architecture, which was brought to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as part of their standardization work for 3G mobile phone systems in UMTS networks. It first appeared in Release 5 (evolution from 2G to 3G networks), when SIP-based multimedia was added. Support for the older GSM and GPRS networks was also provided.
* 3GPP2 (a different organization from 3GPP) based their CDMA2000 Multimedia Domain (MMD) on 3GPP IMS, adding support for CDMA2000.
* 3GPP release 6 added interworking with WLAN, inter-operability between IMS using different IP-connectivity networks, routing group identities, multiple registration and forking, presence, speech recognition and speech-enabled services (Push to talk).
* 3GPP release 7 added support for fixed networks by working together with TISPAN release R1.1, the function of AGCF (access gateway control function) and PES (PSTN emulation service) are introduced to the wire-line network for the sake of inheritance of services which can be provided in PSTN network. AGCF works as a bridge interconnecting the IMS networks and the Megaco/H.248 networks. Megaco/H.248 networks offers the possibility to connect terminals of the old legacy networks to the new generation of networks based on IP networks. AGCF acts a SIP User agent towards the IMS and performs the role of P-CSCF. SIP User Agent functionality is included in the AGCF, and not on the customer device but in the network itself. Also added voice call continuity between circuit switching and packet switching domain (VCC), fixed broadband connection to the IMS, interworking with non-IMS networks, policy and charging control (PCC), emergency sessions. It also added SMS over IP.
* 3GPP release 8 added support for LTE / SAE, multimedia session continuity, enhanced emergency sessions, SMS over SGs and IMS centralized services.
* 3GPP release 9 added support for IMS emergency calls over GPRS and EPS, enhancements to multimedia telephony, IMS media plane security, enhancements to services centralization and continuity.
* 3GPP release 10 added support for inter device transfer, enhancements to the single radio voice call continuity (SRVCC), enhancements to IMS emergency sessions.
* 3GPP release 11 added USSD simulation service, network-provided location information for IMS, SMS submit and delivery without MSISDN in IMS, and overload control.

Some operators opposed IMS because it was seen as complex and expensive.
In response, a cut-down version of IMSâenough of IMS to support voice and SMS over the LTE networkâwas defined and standardized in 2010 as Voice over LTE (VoLTE).

== Architecture ==

Each of the functions in the diagram is explained below.

The IP multimedia core network subsystem is a collection of different functions, linked by standardized interfaces, which grouped form one IMS administrative network. A function is not a node (hardware box): An implementer is free to combine two functions in one node, or to split a single function into two or more nodes. Each node can also be present multiple times in a single network, for dimensioning, load balancing or organizational issues.

=== Access network ===
The user can connect to IMS in various ways, most of which use the standard IP. IMS terminals (such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers) can register directly on IMS, even when they are roaming in another network or country (the visited network). The only requirement is that they can use IP and run SIP user agents. Fixed access (e.g., digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet, FTTx), mobile access (e.g. 5G NR, LTE, W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g., WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service (POTSâthe old analogue telephones), H.323 and non IMS-compatible systems, are supported through gateways.

=== Core network ===
HSS â Home subscriber server:
The &quot;home subscriber server&quot; (HSS), or &quot;user profile server function&quot; (UPSF), is a master user database that supports the IMS network entities that actually handle calls. It contains the subscription-related information (subscriber profiles), performs authentication and authorization of the user, and can provide information about the subscriber&#x27;s location and IP information. It is similar to the GSM home location register (HLR) and Authentication centre (AuC).

A &quot;subscriber location function&quot; (SLF) is needed to map user addresses when multiple HSSs are used.

User identities:
Various identities may be associated with IMS: IP multimedia private identity (IMPI), IP multimedia public identity (IMPU), globally routable user agent URI (GRUU), wildcarded public user identity. Both IMPI and IMPU are not phone numbers or other series of digits, but uniform resource identifier (URIs), that can be digits (a Tel URI, such as &quot;tel:+1-555-123-4567&quot;) or alphanumeric identifiers (a SIP URI, such as &quot;sip:john.doe@example.com&quot; ).

IP Multimedia Private Identity:
The &quot;IP Multimedia Private Identity&quot; (IMPI) is a unique permanently allocated global identity assigned by the home network operator. It has the form of a Network Access Identifier(NAI) i.e. user.name@domain, and is used, for example, for Registration, Authorization, Administration, and Accounting purposes. Every IMS user shall have one IMPI.

IP Multimedia Public Identity:
The &quot;IP Multimedia Public Identity&quot; (IMPU) is used by any user for requesting communications to other users (e.g. this might be included on a business card). Also known as Address of Record (AOR). There can be multiple IMPU per IMPI. The IMPU can also be shared with another phone, so that both can be reached with the same identity (for example, a single phone-number for an entire family).

Globally Routable User Agent URI:
&quot;Globally Routable User Agent URI&quot; (GRUU) is an identity that identifies a unique combination of IMPU and UE instance. 
There are two types of GRUU: Public-GRUU (P-GRUU) and Temporary GRUU (T-GRUU). 
*P-GRUU reveal the IMPU and are very long lived.
*T-GRUU do not reveal the IMPU and are valid until the contact is explicitly de-registered or the current registration expires

Wildcarded Public User Identity:
A &quot;wildcarded Public User Identity&quot; expresses a set of IMPU grouped together.
The HSS subscriber database contains the IMPU, IMPI, IMSI, MSISDN, subscriber service profiles, service triggers, and other information.

====Call Session Control Function (CSCF) ====
Several roles of SIP servers or proxies, collectively called Call Session Control Function (CSCF), are used to process SIP signaling packets in the IMS.

* A &quot;Proxy-CSCF&quot; (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact for the IMS terminal. It can be located either in the visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network (when the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). Some networks may use a Session Border Controller (SBC) for this function. The P-CSCF is at its core a specialized SBC for the Userânetwork interface which not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).
** It is assigned to an IMS terminal before registration, and does not change for the duration of the registration.
** It sits on the path of all signaling, and can inspect every signal; the IMS terminal must ignore any other unencrypted signaling.
** It provides subscriber authentication and may establish an IPsec or TLS security association with the IMS terminal. This prevents spoofing attacks and replay attacks and protects the privacy of the subscriber.
** It inspects the signaling and ensures that the IMS terminals do not misbehave (e.g. change normal signaling routes, disobey home network&#x27;s routing policy).
** It can compress and decompress SIP messages using SigComp, which reduces the round-trip over slow radio links.
** It may include a Policy Decision Function (PDF), which authorizes media plane resources e.g., quality of service (QoS) over the media plane. It is used for policy control, bandwidth management, etc. The PDF can also be a separate function.
** It also generates charging records.
* An &quot;Interrogating-CSCF&quot; (I-CSCF) is another SIP function located at the edge of an administrative domain. Its IP address is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the domain (using NAPTR and SRV type of DNS records), so that remote servers can find it, and use it as a forwarding point (e.g., registering) for SIP packets to this domain.
** it queries the HSS to retrieve the address of the S-CSCF and assign it to a user performing SIP registration
** it also forwards SIP request or response to the S-CSCF
** Up to Release 6 it can also be used to hide the internal network from the outside world (encrypting parts of the SIP message), in which case it&#x27;s called a &quot;Topology Hiding Inter-network Gateway&quot; (THIG). From Release 7 onwards this &quot;entry point&quot; function is removed from the I-CSCF and is now part of the &quot;Interconnection Border Control Function&quot; (IBCF). The IBCF is used as gateway to external networks, and provides NAT and firewall functions (pinholing). The IBCF is a session border controller specialized for the network-to-network interface (NNI).
* A &quot;Serving-CSCF&quot; (S-CSCF) is the central node of the signaling plane. It is a SIP server, but performs session control too. It is always located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces to the HSS to download user profiles and upload user-to-S-CSCF associations (the user profile is only cached locally for processing reasons and is not changed). All necessary subscriber profile information is loaded from the HSS.
** it handles SIP registrations, which allows it to bind the user location (e.g., the IP address of the terminal) and the SIP address
** it sits on the path of all signaling messages of the locally registered users, and can inspect every message
** it decides to which application server(s) the SIP message will be forwarded, in order to provide their services
** it provides routing services, typically using Electronic Numbering (ENUM) lookups
** it enforces the policy of the network operator
** there can be multiple S-CSCFs in the network for load distribution and high availability reasons. It&#x27;s the HSS that assigns the S-CSCF to a user, when it&#x27;s queried by the I-CSCF. There are multiple options for this purpose, including a mandatory/optional capabilities to be matched between subscribers and S-CSCFs.

==== Application servers ====

SIP Application servers (AS) host and execute services, and interface with the S-CSCF using SIP. An example of an application server that is being developed in 3GPP is the Voice call continuity Function (VCC Server). Depending on the actual service, the AS can operate in SIP proxy mode, SIP UA (user agent) mode or SIP B2BUA mode. An AS can be located in the home network or in an external third-party network. If located in the home network, it can query the HSS with the Diameter Sh or Si interfaces (for a SIP-AS).
* SIP AS: Host and execute IMS specific services
* &quot;IP Multimedia Service Switching Function&quot; (IM-SSF): Interfaces SIP to CAP to communicate with CAMEL Application Servers
* OSA service capability server (OSA SCS): Interfaces SIP to the OSA framework;

===== Functional model =====
The AS-ILCM (Application Server - Incoming Leg Control Model) and AS-OLCM (Application Server - Outgoing Leg Control Model) store transaction state, and may optionally store session state depending on the specific service being executed. 
The AS-ILCM interfaces to the S-CSCF (ILCM) for an incoming leg and the AS-OLCM interfaces to the S-CSCF (OLCM) for an outgoing leg.
Application Logic provides the service(s) and interacts between the AS-ILCM and AS-OLCM.

===== Public Service Identity =====
Public Service Identities (PSI) are identities that identify services, which are hosted by application servers. As user identities, PSI takes the form of either a SIP or Tel URI. PSIs are stored in the HSS either as a distinct PSI or as a wildcarded PSI:
* a distinct PSI contains the PSI that is used in routing
* a wildcarded PSI represents a collection of PSIs.

==== Media servers ====
The &quot;Media Resource Function&quot; (MRF) provides media related functions such as media manipulation (e.g. voice stream mixing) and playing of tones and announcements.

Each MRF is further divided into a &quot;media resource function controller&quot; (MRFC) and a &quot;media resource function processor&quot; (MRFP).

* The MRFC is a signalling plane node that interprets information coming from an AS and S-CSCF to control the MRFP
* The MRFP is a media plane node used to mix, source or process media streams. It can also manage access right to shared resources.

The &quot;Media Resource Broker&quot; (MRB) is a functional entity that is responsible for both collection of appropriate published MRF information and supplying of appropriate MRF information to consuming entities such as the AS. MRB can be used in two modes:
* Query mode: AS queries the MRB for media and sets up the call using the response of MRB
* In-Line Mode: AS sends a SIP INVITE to the MRB. The MRB sets up the call

==== Breakout gateway ====
A &quot;Breakout Gateway Control Function&quot; (BGCF) is a SIP proxy which processes requests for routing from an S-CSCF when the S-CSCF has determined that the session cannot be routed using DNS or ENUM/DNS. It includes routing functionality based on telephone numbers.

==== PSTN gateways ====
A PSTN/CS gateway interfaces with PSTN circuit switched (CS) networks. For signalling, CS networks use ISDN User Part (ISUP) (or BICC) over Message Transfer Part (MTP), while IMS uses SIP over IP. For media, CS networks use Pulse-code modulation (PCM), while IMS uses Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).
* A signalling gateway (SGW) interfaces with the signalling plane of the CS. It transforms lower layer protocols as Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP, an IP protocol) into Message Transfer Part (MTP, a Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol), to pass ISDN User Part (ISUP) from the MGCF to the CS network. The SGW does call control protocol conversion between SIP and ISUP/BICC under the control of the MGCF.
* A &quot;media gateway controller function&quot; (MGCF) is a SIP endpoint that interfaces with the SGW over SCTP. It also controls the resources in a &quot;Media Gateway&quot; (MGW) across an H.248 interface.
* A &quot;media gateway&quot; (MGW) interfaces with the media plane of the CS network, by converting between RTP and PCM. It can also transcode when the codecs don&#x27;t match (e.g., IMS might use AMR, PSTN might use G.711).

==== Media resources ====
Media Resources are those components that operate on the media plane and are under the control of IMS core functions. Specifically, &quot;Media Server&quot; (MS) and &quot;Media gateway&quot; (MGW)

=== NGN interconnection ===
There are two types of next-generation networking interconnection:
* Service-oriented interconnection (SoIx): The physical and logical linking of NGN domains that allows carriers and service providers to offer services over NGN (i.e., IMS and PES) platforms with control, signalling (i.e., session based), which provides defined levels of interoperability. For instance, this is the case of &quot;carrier grade&quot; voice and/or multimedia services over IP interconnection. &quot;Defined levels of interoperability&quot; are dependent upon the service or the QoS or the Security, etc.
* Connectivity-oriented interconnection (CoIx): The physical and logical linking of carriers and service providers based on simple IP connectivity irrespective of the levels of interoperability. For example, an IP interconnection of this type is not aware of the specific end to end service and, as a consequence, service specific network performance, QoS and security requirements are not necessarily assured. This definition does not exclude that some services may provide a defined level of interoperability. However, only SoIx fully satisfies NGN interoperability requirements.

An NGN interconnection mode can be direct or indirect. Direct interconnection refers to the interconnection between two network domains without any intermediate network domain. Indirect interconnection at one layer refers to the interconnection between two network domains with one or more intermediate network domain(s) acting as transit networks. The intermediate network domain(s) provide(s) transit functionality to the two other network domains. Different interconnection modes may be used for carrying service layer signalling and media traffic.

=== Charging ===
Offline charging is applied to users who pay for their services periodically (e.g., at the end of the month). Online charging, also known as credit-based charging, is used for prepaid services, or real-time credit control of postpaid services. Both may be applied to the same session.

&quot;Charging function addresses&quot; are addresses distributed to each IMS entities and provide a common location for each entity to send charging information. &quot;charging data function&quot; (CDF) addresses are used for offline billing and &quot;Online Charging Function&quot; (OCF) for online billing.

* Offline Charging : All the SIP network entities (P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, BGCF, MRFC, MGCF, AS) involved in the session use the Diameter Rf interface to send accounting information to a CDF located in the same domain. The CDF will collect all this information, and build a &quot;call detail record&quot; (CDR), which is sent to the billing system of the domain.Each session carries an &quot;IMS Charging Identifier&quot; (ICID) as a unique identifier generated by the first IMS entity involved in a SIP transaction and used for the correlation with CDRs. &quot;Inter Operator Identifier&quot; (IOI) is a globally unique identifier shared between sending and receiving networks. Each domain has its own charging network. Billing systems in different domains will also exchange information, so that roaming charges can be applied.
* Online charging : The S-CSCF talks to a &quot;IMS gateway function&quot; (IMS-GWF) which looks like a regular SIP application server. The IMS-GWF can signal the S-CSCF to terminate the session when the user runs out of credits during a session. The AS and MRFC use the Diameter Ro interface towards an OCF.
** When &quot;immediate event charging&quot; (IEC) is used, a number of credit units is immediately deducted from the user&#x27;s account by the ECF and the MRFC or AS is then authorized to provide the service. The service is not authorized when not enough credit units are available.
** When &quot;event charging with unit reservation&quot; (ECUR) is used, the ECF (event charging function) first reserves a number of credit units in the user&#x27;s account and then authorizes the MRFC or the AS. After the service is over, the number of spent credit units is reported and deducted from the account; the reserved credit units are then cleared.

=== IMS-based PES architecture ===
IMS-based PES (PSTN Emulation System) provides IP networks services to analog devices. IMS-based PES allows non-IMS devices to appear to IMS as normal SIP users. Analog terminal using standard analog interfaces can connect to IMS-based PES in two ways:
* Via A-MGW (Access Media Gateway) that is linked and controlled by AGCF. AGCF is placed within the Operators network and controls multiple A-MGW. A-MGW and AGCF communicate using H.248.1 (Megaco) over the P1 reference point. POTS phone connect to A-MGW over the z interface. The signalling is converted to H.248 in the A-MGW and passed to AGCF. AGCF interprets the H.248 signal and other inputs from the A-MGW to format H.248 messages into appropriate SIP messages. AGCF presents itself as P-CSCF to the S-CSCF and passes generated SIP messages to S-CSCF or to IP border via IBCF (Interconnection Border Control Function). Service presented to S-CSCF in SIP messages trigger PES AS. AGCF has also certain service independent logic, for example on receipt of off-hook event from A-MGW, the AGCF requests the A-MGW to play dial tone.
* Via VGW (VoIP-Gateway) or SIP Gateway/Adapter on customer premises. POTS phones via VOIP Gateway connect to P-CSCF directly. Operators mostly use session border controllers between VoIP gateways and P-CSCFs for security and to hide network topology. VoIP gateway link to IMS using SIP over Gm reference point. The conversion from POTS service over the z interface to SIP occurs in the customer premises VoIP gateway. POTS signaling is converted to SIP and passed on to P-CSCF. VGW acts as SIP user agent and appears to P-CSCF as SIP terminal.

Both A-MGW and VGW are unaware of the services. They only relay call control signalling to and from the PSTN terminal. Session control and handling is done by IMS components.

=== Interfaces description ===

== Session handling ==
One of the most important features of IMS, that of allowing for a SIP application to be dynamically and differentially (based on the user&#x27;s profile) triggered, is implemented as a filter-and-redirect signalling mechanism in the S-CSCF.

The S-CSCF might apply filter criteria to determine the need to forward SIP requests to AS. It is important to note that services for the originating party will be applied in the originating network, while the services for the terminating party will be applied in the terminating network, all in the respective S-CSCFs.

=== Initial filter criteria ===
An initial filter criteria (iFC) is an XML-based format used for describing control logic. iFCs represent a provisioned subscription of a user to an application. They are stored in the HSS as part of the IMS Subscription Profile and are downloaded to the S-CSCF upon user registration (for registered users) or on processing demand (for services, acting as unregistered users). iFCs are valid throughout the registration lifetime or until the User Profile is changed.

The iFC is composed of:
* Priority - determines the order of checking the trigger.
* Trigger point - logical condition(s) which is verified against initial dialog creating SIP requests or stand-alone SIP requests.
* Application server URI - specifies the application server to be forwarded to when the trigger point matches.

There are two types of iFCs:
* Shared - When provisioning, only a reference number (the shared iFC number) is assigned to the subscriber. During registration, only the number is sent to the CSCF, not the entire XML description. The complete XML will have previously been stored on the CSCF.
* Non-shared - when provisioning, the entire XML description of the iFC is assigned to the subscriber. During registration, the entire XML description is sent to the CSCF.

== Security aspects of early IMS and non-3GPP systems ==
It is envisaged that security defined in TS 33.203 may not be available for a while especially because of the lack of USIM/ISIM interfaces and prevalence of devices that support IPv4. For this situation, to provide some protection against the most significant threats, 3GPP defines some security mechanisms, which are informally known as &quot;early IMS security,&quot; in TR33.978. This mechanism relies on the authentication performed during the network attachment procedures, which binds between the user&#x27;s profile and its IP address. This mechanism is also weak because the signaling is not protected on the userânetwork interface.

CableLabs in PacketCable 2.0, which adopted also the IMS architecture but has no USIM/ISIM capabilities in their terminals, published deltas to the 3GPP specifications where the Digest-MD5 is a valid authentication option. Later on, TISPAN also did a similar effort given their fixed networks scopes, although the procedures are different. To compensate for the lack of IPsec capabilities, TLS has been added as an option for securing the Gm interface. Later 3GPP Releases have included the Digest-MD5 method, towards a Common-IMS platform, yet in its own and again different approach. Although all 3 variants of Digest-MD5 authentication have the same functionality and are the same from the IMS terminal&#x27;s perspective, the implementations on the Cx interface between the S-CSCF and the HSS are different.

<doc id="1152836" wikidata="Q7203758" url="?curid=1152836" title="Pleading the belly">
<text>Pleading the belly was a process in English common law which permitted a woman in the later stages of pregnancy to receive a reprieve of her death sentence until after she bore her child. The plea was available at least as early as 1387 and was eventually rendered obsolete by the Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Act 1931, which stated that an expecting mother would automatically have her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour.

The plea did not constitute a defence and could only be made after a verdict of guilty was delivered. Upon making the plea, the convict was entitled to be examined by a jury of matrons, generally selected from the observers present at the trial. If she was found to be pregnant with a quick child (that is, a foetus sufficiently developed to render its movement detectable), the convict was granted a reprieve of sentence until the next hanging time after her delivery.
Scholarly reviews of the Old Bailey Sessions Papers and Assize records from the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I have shown that women granted such reprieves were often subsequently granted pardons or had their sentences commuted to transportation. Even those women who were subsequently executed pursuant to their original sentences were often executed behind schedule.

The pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read both used this plea to delay execution, although it is unclear if either woman was actually pregnant.

It appears that women were often fraudulently or erroneously found to be quick with child. Daniel Defoe&#x27;s Moll Flanders includes a character who successfully pleaded her belly despite being &quot;no more with child than the judge that tried [her]&quot;. John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; includes a scene where the character Filch picks up income working as a &quot;child getter ... helping the ladies to a pregnancy against their being called down to sentence&quot;.

As a check against this abuse of the system, the law held that no woman could be granted a second reprieve from the original sentence on the ground of subsequent pregnancy, even if the foetus had quickened. In the event that a prisoner became pregnant, her gaoler or the local sheriff was subject to a fine.

<text>was a Japanese manufacturer of audio and video equipment. Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, it was part of the Bermuda conglomerate (from 2011).

The company was founded in Tokyo in 1947 by Kosaku Kikuchi, who had worked for a radio parts distributor in Tokyo before and during World War II. Due to the poor quality of radio parts Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He chose transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi&#x27;s thought was &quot;Even with higher prices, let&#x27;s make the higher quality of products.&quot;

In 1954 manufacturing pre-amp, main-amp kits, as well as finished amplifiers which used tubes, was started; in 1958 Sansui introduced the first stereo tube pre- and main amplifiers. By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components. They were sold in foreign markets through that and the next decade. Sansui&#x27;s amplifiers and tuners from the 1960s and 1970s remain in demand by audio enthusiasts.
Since 1965 the matte-black-faced AU-series amplifiers were released. In 1967 Sansui produced its first turntable.

In 1971, Sansui introduced the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four-channel stereo from two-channel sources. Sansui developed the QS Regular Matrix system, which made it possible to transmit four-channel Quadraphonic sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3Â dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20Â dB separation. The SQ system developed by Columbia/CBS was the most popular matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four-channel system: CD-4 (or Quadradisc) by Japanese JVC and American RCA. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but Decca used the Sansui QS system. The 2-channel-range was extended by tape machines and cassette decks. The company also produced the Sansui AU-11000 in the mid-70s .

In 1974 Kosaku Kikuchi resigned, and vice-president Kenzo Fujiwara became president.

In the late 1970s, the first-generation &#x27;07&#x27; models included the dual-mono power supply AU-517 and AU-717, and the second generation featured the updated AU-719, 819, and 919 were released. The separate pre-amp/power-amp CA-F1/BA-F1 topped the model range along with the AU-X1 integrated amplifier (1979).

In the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 amplifier and its more powerful sibling the AU-D33, were acclaimed by audiophiles and were so well matched to a pair of KEF Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets. These amplifiers used a complex feed-forward servo system which resulted in very low second order harmonic distortion. Despite this success, Sansui failed to follow up with further mass-market audiophile components.

As the mid-1980s arrived, sales were lost to competitors (Sony, Pioneer, Matsushita&#x27;s Technics). Sansui began to lose visibility in the United States around 1988, and then focused on manufacturing high-end components in Japan. The company began to manufacture high-end television sets and other video equipment, but ceased exportation. In the late 1990s, the company&#x27;s brand was used on video equipment manufactured by other companies. The current manufacturer of the rebranded sets is Orion Electric, based in Osaka and Fukui, Japan. Its U.S. subsidiary markets products under the Sansui brand, among others. Sansui is thus a mere umbrella brand at present. This radical change in Sansui&#x27;s corporate identity has resulted in a notable change in its product quality as consumers now tend to consider Sansui a mass-market brand rather than a maker of high-end electronics.

Sansui had developed the patented Î±(alpha)-x balanced circuit, that used in its high power amplifier along with the so-called double diamond differential, another patent for balanced driver stage. Lately Sansui had developed a turntable, P-L95R, with a handling similar to CD-players; it allowed to play both sides of the record without turning it. 
Its latest amplifiers included the a-u alpha series like the 707Â´and 907 (1987) au-x1111 (round about 1990) and others; b-2105 mos with a weight of (1999)
Sansui ended its Japanese production of high-end amplifiers some time between 2002 and 2005. In 2001 the headquarters in Shi-Yokohama was closed.

The Japanese website as HiFi-manufacturer was last updated January 2014; Sansui went out of business in 2014. Sansui&#x27;s sales had shriveled to just 40.4 million yen by 2010. The 2003 founded Sansui Electric China Co Ltd stayed longer than 2014. In Japan, consumer product maker Doshisha has the right to manufacture and sell under the Sansui brand. Outside of Japan, the brand belongs to Nimble Holdings of Hong Kong.

<doc id="1152852" wikidata="Q180134" url="?curid=1152852" title="Brian Hall (footballer, born 1946)">
<text>Brian William Hall (22 November 1946 â 16 July 2015) was a Scottish footballer who played as a midfielder. He won six trophies with Liverpool in the 1970s. Hall then played for Plymouth Argyle and Burnley.

==Background==

Hall was born in Glasgow and raised in Lancashire. He had trials with each of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End in his teens. He moved to study for a degree in mathematics at the University of Liverpool, choosing to study in the city because he was, &#x27;a Beatles nut&#x27;.

==Club career==
===Liverpool===

After his move to study in Liverpool a friend of his arranged a trial for Liverpool. He signed at Anfield as an amateur in 1965. Three years later he turned professional after completing his degree.

Hall made his debut in a 0-0 league draw with Stoke City at the Victoria Ground on 7 April 1969. After two further substitute appearances he broke into the first team in autumn of the 1970/71 season. He replaced the injured Ian Callaghan on the right wing. Shankly was sufficiently impressed to move Callaghan on his return into a central midfield role to accommodate them both. His first goal was in the semi-final of the FA Cup against Merseyside rivals Everton at Old Trafford on 27 March 1971 with a dramatic 75th minute volley to clinch a 2-1 comeback. Hall played in the 1971 FA Cup Final and was one of Liverpool&#x27;s brighter performers on the day. Arsenal came back to win the game 2-1 after extra time.

Two years later, he was part of the team which won both the 1972â73 Football League and 1972â73 UEFA Cup. Hall started the home first leg of that 1973 UEFA Cup Final against Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, but the game was abandoned after 27 minutes due to a downpour. Shankly in watching those 27 minutes before the game was abandoned felt the German defence was suspect in the air. He changed his starting line up for the re-arranged game the following evening. Shankly brought in tall forward John Toshack to the starting line up instead demoting Hall to appearing only as an 83rd-minute substitute for Steve Heighway in a 3â0 win. Hall was unused from the substitutes bench in the 2â0 defeat in the away leg for a 3-2 aggregate win.

He scored Liverpool&#x27;s opener in the 1973â74 FA Cup 3-1 semi final replay win against Leicester City. On 4 May 1974 he played in Liverpool&#x27;s 3â0 defeat of Newcastle United to win the FA Cup. Described by Liverpool as one of Hall&#x27;s best games, he lined up with Peter Cormack in an all-Scottish born central-midfield pairing. For the opening goal Tommy Smith sent in a cross from the right towards Hall on the edge of the box that Hall dived underneath. As goal scorer Kevin Keegan said in the post match interviews, &quot;Brian sort of was going to flick it and I shouted, &quot;leave it&quot;. Had he flicked it I couldn&#x27;t have done anything about it. As it happened as it come through I had plenty of time to do what, really, pick my spot.&quot; Hall was also involved in the passing build up that led to Keegan&#x27;s second and Liverpool&#x27;s third goal.

Hall played in the subsequent 1974 FA Charity Shield penalty shoot out win against Leeds. Hall took a penalty in the shoot out and scored. On 17 September 1974 Hall was part of the Liverpool side which recorded their 11â0 record European result against Norwegian side StrÃ¸msgodset in a Cup Winners Cup First Round First Leg tie at Anfield, of the 10 outfield players who played in the match he was the only one not to get on the score sheet. Hall&#x27;s greatest number of first team appearances was in season 1974/75 including 35 league appearances. However Liverpool finished second to Dave Mackay&#x27;s Derby County in the league. Their defence of the FA Cup was unsuccessful with fourth round elimination by Ipswich Town.

By the halfway stage of the 1975/76 season his place in the first team had gone to Jimmy Case, a similar fate that befell Cormack who lost his place after injuring his knee in training. Hall played in nine games en route to the 1976 UEFA Cup Final. However he was an unused substitute in both legs of the final 4-3 aggregate defeat of Club Brugge. He left Liverpool in 1976. He had made 224 first team appearances before he left scoring 21 goals.

===Plymouth Argyle===

Aged 30 he dropped down a division to join Plymouth Argyle in the summer of 1976 for Â£35,000. They were relegated at the end of the season.

===Burnley===

In November 1977 he stepped up a division to join Burnley for Â£25,000. He initially toiled before establishing himself in season 1978â79. He then only played a handful of games as his side were relegated at the end of the 1979â80 season.

===Northwich Victoria===

He moved to Northwich Victoria in 1980 on a free transfer.

==Style of play==

The profile of Hall on the Liverpool FC website says, &quot;He was an industrious player who always gave his all for Liverpool. Hall was small in stature, but clever and a very efficient footballer. Bill Shankly liked those attributes. He became a vital part of the team Shankly rebuilt in the early 70s.&quot;

In his obituary in The Independent he is described, &quot;Hall tended to be an unobtrusive performer not often given to spectacular interventions, although his adroitly hooked volley which beat Everton in an FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford in 1971 was a glorious exception. His forte was foraging ceaselessly for the ball then passing it with the minimum of fuss to the nearest red shirt in time-honoured Liverpool fashion. He kept moves flowing and could invariably be relied on to support the man in possession, embodying the messianic Shankly&#x27;s devotion to the creed of the collective.&quot; The same obituary further described him as, &quot;skilful, wirily resilient... making light of a slight deficiency in pace by his ceaseless industry.

==After playing==

He was voted number 75 in the poll, &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;.

Hall worked as a teacher and for Preston Borough Council as its Chief Recreation Officer, before returning to Anfield in 1991 to take on the role of the Liverpool Football in the Community Officer. He retained this public-relations role under several different titles until he retired in 2011 suffering from leukaemia. Hall died in Preston on 16 July 2015. He was married with two daughters and one son.

<text>Johnston Blakeley (October 1781 â October 1814) was a United States Navy officer who served during the Quasi-War and the War of 1812. He is considered to be one of the most successful American naval officers of the period.

==Early life==
Blakeley was born near Seaforde, County Down, Ireland. Brought to the United States as a child in 1783, he graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, in 1800, then joined the Navy and was appointed a Midshipman in 1800.

After service in during the Quasi-War with France and command of early in the War of 1812, Master Commandant Blakeley was appointed to command of the newly built sloop-of-war .

==Commerce Raiding in the War of 1812==

===Beginning of Commerce Raiding===
The USS Wasp under Johnston Blakeley departed Portsmouth on May 1, 1814, at four oâclock in the afternoon, cleared the American harbor at dusk, and set off into the Atlantic under a fresh breeze. The Wasp went on the month-long voyage across the Atlantic. Blakeleyâs goal was the English Channel, where British ships, presumably safe in home waters, formed their convoys for outgoing voyages and scattered upon their return for their various home ports. The Wasp arrived on station in late May and on June 2 took and burned her first prize, the bark Neptune. Unlike privateers who expected to seize property for profit, Blakeley was a commerce raider who had orders to destroy his prizes after looting them for needed supplies and provisions.

===Destroying 3 vessels and making 1 vessel into a cartel===
Over the following weeks the Wasp seized another four ships- the brig William, the brig Pallas, the galliot Henrietta, and the 325-ton ship Orange Boven. All of these prizes were burned or scuttled, except the Henrietta, whose cargo was overboard so that she could be used as a cartel ship to convey paroled prisoners to England.

===Destroying HMS Reindeer===
On June 28, Blakeley sighted two sails and chased them. The Wasp identified a vessel as the British vessel HMS Reindeer. Reindeer was commanded by William Manners. After a sea combat of broadside bombardments, cannon shooting, and maneuvering. Captain Manners wounded in both legs turned the Reindeer toward the Wasp, crashing into her port side. The British swarmed to the rail to board the Wasp but were repeatedly beaten back by the âcool and deliberateâ American musket fire. Manners who led the van got shot down. Then he got shot in the head by an American marine sharpshooter. At Blakeleyâs order, the Americans stormed the Reindeer. After the Americans won, the Americans had 9 killed and 15 wounded. While the British had 25 killed and 42 wounded. Blakeley had the prisoners and the British twelve pounders, the Reindeer was burned at Blakeleyâs orders.

===Further Raiding British Shipping===
Blakeley then set course for the nearest neutral port, LâOrient in France. Capturing en route two more British merchantmen. Independence day was celebrated by burning the brig Regulator, laden with port wine, and two days later the schooner Jenny was scuttled. During a 3-week interlude in hospitable LâOrient. Blakeley was having his vessel repaired while he sent 79 prisoners to England on a cartel ship.

===Raiding and Destroying 2 British Brigs===
On August 27, Blakely on the resupplied Wasp headed back to her former cruising ground in the English Channel. Blakeley destroyed two prizes in the first two days on station, the brigs Lettice and Bon Accord.

===Raiding a British Convoy===
On September 1, Blakeley encountered a Gibraltar-bound convoy of ten merchantmen protected by the seventy-four-gun Armada. The swift Wasp easily outsailed and outmaneuvered the lumbering ship-of-the-line, darting in and cutting out and burning the brig Mary, which carried a valuable cargo of cannon and military stores.

===Defeating HMS Avon===
Continuing south toward Gibraltar, the Wasp sighted four sails in the late afternoon. Blakeley ordered pursuit of the nearest vessel. After a lot of cannon fire and combat, the enemy vessel surrendered. But three more enemy vessels came by. Blakeley, judging that the risk was too great, decided to slip away in the gloom. The vanquished but rescued British vessel was the brig HMS Avon. The Avon sank with 10 killed and 29 wounded. While the USS Wasp escaped with 3 wounded.
===Last Raiding Voyage=== 
The Wasp continued south, taking and sinking two more brigs which were the Three Brothers and the Bacchus. By 21 September the Wasp was about 75 miles east of the Madeira Islands when she captured the brig Atlanta, armed with eight guns. The valuable cargo of wine, brandy, and silk induced Blakeley to keep the prize for the first time on the cruise. Blakeley entrusted the command to American Midshipman David Geisinger. David Geisinger was ordered to take the prize to the United States, and the two ships parted company near the island of Porto Santo. The Wasp sailed before the trade winds, on October 9, 1814, she encountered a neutral Swedish brig, the Adonis. Two American officers, passengers on the Adonis, transferred to the Wasp, which sailed into the vast central Atlantic toward home by way of the West Indies. Geisinger arrived with the Atlanta in Savannah, Georgia on November 4, 1814. Then Wasp under Blakeley mysteriously disappeared out of sight, probably foundered in a storm. Blakeley received the Thanks of Congress, a gold medal, and posthumous advancement to the rank of Captain for his last cruise. 

==Benefits for Blakeleyâs Family in the aftermath==
Captain Blakeley was married, in December, 1813, to Miss Jane Hoope, the daughter of his father&#x27;s old friend, Mr. Hoope, of New York; and has left an only daughter, who received one of the most noble and substantial and affecting tributes of national gratitude which has occurred in the history of this country. The legislature of North Carolina, on 27 December 1816, after prescribing the destination of the sword they had voted to Captain Blakeley, &quot;Resolved, unanimously, That Captain Blakeley&#x27;s child be educated at the expense of this State; and that Mrs. Jane Blakeley be requested to draw on the Treasurer of this State, from time to time, for such sums of money as shall be required for the education of the said child.&quot;

==Honors==
===Ships===
Three ships have been named in Captain Blakeley&#x27;s honor:

* , a new class of torpedo boat in 1904 for the United States Navy
* , a during World War II 
* destroyer escort, later to be reclassified as a frigate, named for both Captain Johnston Blakely and Vice Admiral Charles Adams Blakely

===Places===
* Blakely, Georgia, county seat of Early County
* Blakely Borough, Pennsylvania, established 27 August 1867 
* Blakely Township, Pennsylvania (est. 1818)
* Port Blakely, named by Charles Wilkes during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838-1842 
* Blakely Island, part of the San Juan Islands in Washington state

Also part of the San Juan Islands chain are a group of islands to which Wilkes bestowed the name &quot;Wasp Islands&quot; after the &quot;Wasp&quot;. Their namesake, however, was not the same vessel commanded by Blakely, but an earlier , also a sloop-of-war, which was commissioned in 1807 and captured by the British in the early months of the War of 1812.

<doc id="1152886" wikidata="Q113213644" url="?curid=1152886" title="Urine test">
<text>A urine test is any medical test performed on a urine specimen. The analysis of urine is a valuable diagnostic tool because its composition reflects the functioning of many body systems, particularly the kidneys and urinary system, and specimens are easy to obtain. Common urine tests include the routine urinalysis, which examines the physical, chemical, and microscopic properties of the urine; urine drug screening; and urine pregnancy testing.

==Background==
The value of urine for diagnostic purposes has been recognized since ancient times. Urine examination was practiced in Sumer and Babylonia as early as 4000 BC, and is described in ancient Greek and Sanskrit texts. Contemporary urine testing uses a range of methods to investigate the physical and biochemical properties of the urine. For instance, the results of the routine urinalysis can provide information about the functioning of the kidneys and urinary system; suggest the presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI); and screen for possible diabetes or liver disease, among other conditions. A urine culture can be performed to identify the bacterial species involved in a UTI. Simple point-of-care tests can detect pregnancy by identifying the presence of beta-hCG in the urine and indicate the use of recreational drugs by detecting excreted drugs or their metabolites. Analysis of abnormal cells in urine (urine cytology) can help to diagnose some cancers, and testing for organic acids or amino acids in urine can be used to screen for some genetic disorders.

==Specimen collection==

The techniques used to collect urine specimens vary based on the desired test. A random urine, meaning a specimen that is collected at any time, can be used for many tests. However, a sample collected during the first urination of the morning (first morning specimen) is preferred for tests like urinalysis and pregnancy screening because it is typically more concentrated, making the test more sensitive. Because the concentration of many substances in the urine varies throughout the day, some tests require timed urine collections, in which the patient collects all of their urine into a container for a given period of time (commonly 24 hours). A small amount of the specimen is then removed for testing. Timed collections are commonly used to measure creatinine, urea, urine protein, hormones and electrolytes. 

If urine is needed for microbiological culture, it is important that the sample is not contaminated. In this case, the proper collection procedure involves cleaning the genital area, beginning to urinate into the toilet, and then filling the specimen container before completing the urination into the toilet. This is called a &quot;midstream clean catch&quot; collection. Research has shown many women are unsure of how to take a midstream sample or why it is needed. 

If the subject is not able to urinate voluntarily, samples can be obtained using a urinary catheter or by inserting a needle through the abdomen and into the bladder (suprapubic aspiration). In infants and young children, urine can be collected into a bag attached to the genital region, but this is associated with a high risk of contamination.

==Types==
Some examples of urine tests include:

===Chemistry===

*Urinalysis â assessment of the visual properties of the urine, chemical evaluation using urine test strips, and microscopic examination
*Urine creatinine, creatinine clearance â used to assess kidney function
*Albumin/creatinine ratio â used to diagnose microalbuminuria
*Urine osmolality â measure of the solute concentration of urine
*Urine specific gravity â another measure of urine concentration
*Urine electrolyte levels â measurement of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium in urine
*Urine anion gap â used to distinguish between some causes of metabolic acidosis

===Hormones===
*Urine pregnancy test â detects human chorionic gonadotropin in urine
*Urine cortisol â used to investigate disorders of the adrenal glands
*Urine metanephrines â used to help diagnose some rare tumours

===Microbiology===

*Urine culture â microbiological culture of urine samples, used to identify bacteria causing urinary tract infections

===Miscellaneous===
*Urine drug screen â screen for usage of recreational drugs
*Urine cytology â cytopathological examination of cells in the urine, used to screen for cancer 
*Urine protein electrophoresis â classification and measurement of different proteins in the urine; used to help diagnose monoclonal gammopathies 
*Urine organic acids, urine amino acids â used to test for some inborn errors of metabolism

<text>Patricia Elizabeth Sawin (born December 3, 1956) is an American folklorist who focuses her research and teaching on informal narrative, festival, folklore theory, and the culture of adoptive families. She is an associate professor in the Department of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she coordinates the MA program in Folklore. She is a member of the executive board of the American Folklore Society.

== Early life ==
Sawin was born December 3, 1956, in Boulder, Colorado, to Marilynn Daisy Skidmore Sawin and Horace Lewis Sawin. Her father was a member of the English Department, a specialist in Victorian Literature with an early interest in computing in the humanities, and later Associate Dean in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Her mother taught Composition for the Department of English, later worked for the Film Studies program, and helped to establish the program in Women and Gender Studies. She has one sister, Barbara Lewis Sawin Donaldson.

Sawin attended public schools in Boulder for most of her K-12 years, but studied in the 9th grade at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, Cheltenham, England, and the 12th grade at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1974.

She became interested in the study of traditional culture because of her childhood fascination with fairy tales and her participation as a teenager in international folk dancing. She was an avid hiker in the Colorado mountains and a competitive swimmer.

<text>The Sierra Madre del Sur is a mountain range in southern Mexico, extending from southern MichoacÃ¡n east through Guerrero, to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in eastern Oaxaca.

==Geography==
The Sierra Madre del Sur joins with the Eje VolcÃ¡nico Transversal (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt) of central Mexico in northern Oaxaca, but is separated from this range further west by the valley of the Balsas River and its tributary the Tepalcatepec River.

The mountains&#x27; highest point is Cerro Nube â , in southern Oaxaca. Just one major highway crossed the range between Acapulco and Mexico City until 2024, when two major highways, both in the state of Oaxaca, were inaugurated. 

Although separated from the main part of the Sierra Madre del Sur by the deep canyon of the lower RÃ­o Balsas, the mountains of southern MichoacÃ¡n around CoalcomÃ¡n are usually considered part of the Sierra Madre del Sur.

The eastern end of the Sierra Madre del Sur, in southern Oaxaca, is known as the Sierra MiahuatlÃ¡n. It extends eastâwest for about 180 km parallel to the Pacific coast, with broad areas over 1,500 metres elevation, including Cerro Nube. It is bounded on the east and northeast by the valley of the Tehuantepec River and on the north by the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. The Pacific (southern) slope of the Sierra MiahuatlÃ¡n is covered by humid broadleaf forests.

==Ecology==
The range is noted for its very high biodiversity and large number of endemic species.

The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests ecoregion occupies the higher reaches of the range. These forests are part of a chain of Mesoamerican pine-oak forests that stretch from the Southwestern United States to Costa Rica along the American Cordillera.

Lower elevations of the range are covered by tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests include closed-canopy forests, woodlands, and thorn scrub, and many trees and shrubs lose their leaves during the winter dry season. The Jalisco dry forests ecoregion occupies the western end of the range&#x27;s Pacific slope. The Southern Pacific dry forests occupy most of the Pacific slope of the range, from Michoacan in the west through Guerrero and Oaxaca. The basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra, is home to the Balsas dry forests.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in the Sierra include the Sierra de ManantlÃ¡n, ZicuirÃ¡n-Infiernillo, and TehuacÃ¡n-CuicatlÃ¡n biosphere reserves, General Juan Ãlvarez National Park, BoquerÃ³n de TonalÃ¡ Flora and Fauna Protection Area, Omiltemi Ecological State Park, Los Olivos and El Nanchal state reserves, and the Campo Verde, Iliatenco, Cafetal San Juanito (Pluma Hidalgo), Cafetal Soconusco, Cerro Azul, ConcepciÃ³n Vista Hermosa, El Corozal, and El BorbollÃ³n, La Pandura y La Yerbabuena voluntary conservation areas.

<doc id="1152896" wikidata="Q899689" url="?curid=1152896" title="Side chain">
<text>In organic chemistry and biochemistry, a side chain is a chemical group that is attached to a core part of the molecule called the &quot;main chain&quot; or backbone. The side chain is a hydrocarbon branching element of a molecule that is attached to a larger hydrocarbon backbone. It is one factor in determining a molecule&#x27;s properties and reactivity. A side chain is also known as a pendant chain, but a pendant group (side group) has a different definition.

==Conventions==
The placeholder R is often used as a generic placeholder for alkyl (saturated hydrocarbon) group side chains in structural formulae. To indicate other non-carbon groups in structure diagrams, X, Y, or Z are often used.

==History==
The &quot;R&quot; symbol was introduced by 19th-century French chemist Charles FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gerhardt, who advocated its adoption on the grounds that it would be widely recognizable and intelligible given its correspondence in multiple European languages to the initial letter of &quot;root&quot; or &quot;residue&quot;: French &#x27; (&quot;root&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;residue&quot;), these terms&#x27; respective English translations along with &quot;radical&quot; (itself derived from Latin &#x27; below), Latin &#x27; (&quot;root&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;residue&quot;), and German &#x27; (&quot;remnant&quot; and, in the context of chemistry, both &quot;residue&quot; and &quot;radical&quot;).

==Usage==

===Organic chemistry===
In polymer science, the side chain of an oligomeric or polymeric offshoot extends from the backbone chain of a polymer. Side chains have noteworthy influence on a polymer&#x27;s properties, mainly its crystallinity and density. An oligomeric branch may be termed a short-chain branch, and a polymeric branch may be termed a long-chain branch. Side groups are different from side chains; they are neither oligomeric nor polymeric.

===Biochemistry===
In proteins, which are composed of amino acid residues, the side chains are attached to the alpha-carbon atoms of the amide backbone. The side chain connected to the alpha-carbon is specific for each amino acid and is responsible for determining charge and polarity of the amino acid. The amino acid side chains are also responsible for many of the interactions that lead to proper protein folding and function. Amino acids with similar polarity are usually attracted to each other, while nonpolar and polar side chains usually repel each other. Nonpolar/polar interactions can still play an important part in stabilizing the secondary structure due to the relatively large amount of them occurring throughout the protein. Spatial positions of side-chain atoms can be predicted based on protein backbone geometry using computational tools for side-chain reconstruction.

<text>The Mermaid Series was a major collection of reprints of texts from English Elizabethan, Jacobean and Restoration drama. It was launched in 1887 by the British publisher Henry Vizetelly and under the general editorship of Havelock Ellis. Around 1894 the series was taken over by the London firm of T. Fisher Unwin. Many well-known literary figures edited or introduced the texts. Some of the plays published had not been reprinted in recent editions, and most had dropped out of the stage repertoire.

The name alludes to the Mermaid Tavern in London. There has been a later New Mermaids Series.

He was elected as Shelton City Finance Commissioner and to the Washington House of Representatives in 1976 and served in those capacities until 1983, when he was elected to the Washington State Senate. In 1989, he formed a non-profit organization called Strategies for Youth, first as a way to fight substance abuse among Washington&#x27;s young people and later with a greater emphasis on bullying and respecting diversity. The program concluded in 2011.
In 1996, Owen moved from the legislature to the executive branch with his election as lieutenant governor. He was re-elected to that position in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. Following findings by the state&#x27;s Executive Ethics Commission that Owen improperly used tax-payer resources, which led to a $15,000 fine being imposed against him, Owen announced that he would not seek another term in the 2016 election. Prior to that announcement, three current legislators from his own party had already begun campaigning for his office. His final term expired in January 2017. He was succeeded in office by Cyrus Habib.

Owen is opposed to abortion, campaigns against drug use and drug legalisation and is described as &quot;lukewarm&quot; on gay rights. He has received criticism for his work ethic, not working outside of the legislative calendar, conducting remote work and prioritizing his outside business interests ahead of his duties as Lieutenant Governor. In September 2014, he was fined $15,000 for breaking state law by using state resources to run Strategies for Youth, his personal non-profit group.

On April 2, 2008, the King of Spain Juan Carlos I bestowed the Order of Isabella the Catholic, or Spanish knighthood, on Owen.

<text>JosÃ© AntÃ´nio Kroeff Lutzenberger (17 December 1926 â 14 May 2002) was a Brazilian agronomist and environmentalist. In 1988, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for his &quot;contribution to protecting the natural environment in Brazil and worldwide&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born in a German-Brazilian family in Porto Alegre, the capital city of southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, as the only son of architect Joseph Franz Seraph Lutzenberger. He graduated in Agronomy at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in 1950. For more than 15 years he worked in Germany, Venezuela and Morocco for a German chemical company, BASF.

In 1971, Lutzenberger founded the &quot;AssociaÃ§Ã£o GaÃºcha de ProteÃ§Ã£o ao Ambiente Natural&quot; (Agapan), an environmentalist organization. He became famous for defending the environment together with Magda Renner, Hilda Wrasse Zimmermann, Giselda Castro and others during the time of military government in Brazil. He was appointed to the Environment Ministry in the Fernando Collor de Mello federal government, in the early 1990s.

&quot;He was Brazil&#x27;s first internationally known environmental activist, and the fact he was chosen environment minister in Brazil&#x27;s first democratically elected government in 30 years was just one indication of the tremendous mark he made in that area,&quot; said Stephan Schwartzman, senior scientist at Environmental Defense.

In 1987 Lutzenberger founded a group called Gaia, which focused on global issues, and a year later he won the Right Livelihood Award in recognition of his work.

Like millions of others in southern Brazil, the Kroeff-Lutzenberger family was bilingual, speaking both Portuguese, the national and official language of the land, but also German, a strong regional language in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Lutzenberg also achieved a high level of fluency in English, Spanish and French.

The Guarita State Park in Torres, Rio Grande do Sul, was renamed the JosÃ© Lutzenberger State Park in his honor in January 2003.

== Death ==
Lutzenberger died in 2002 at the age of 75. He was buried as he wished â naked, without a coffin, close to a tree in a farm he restored, the RincÃ£o Gaia in Pantano Grande, Rio Grande do Sul.

<text>Joshua Barney (6 July 1759 â 1 December 1818) was an American naval officer who served in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War and in the French Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars. He later achieved the rank of commodore in the United States Navy and served in the War of 1812.

==Early life and family==
Barney was born in Baltimore on July 6, 1759. He went to sea at the age of 12 in 1771. In 1775, he served as second-in-command to his brother-in-law aboard a merchant ship bound for Europe; after his brother-in-law died, he assumed command and sailed the ship to Nice.

Barney married twice, and had children with both wives. While on his way to Kentucky, where he planned to retire, he died in Pittsburgh. His widow Harriet settled in Kentucky with their three children. His grandson Joseph Nicholson Barney was also a United States Navy (and Confederate States Navy) officer.

==Revolutionary War==
Barney served in the Continental Navy beginning in February 1776, as master&#x27;s mate of where he took part in Commodore Esek Hopkins&#x27;s raid on New Providence. Later he served aboard and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant for gallantry in the action between &quot;Wasp&quot; and a British brig, the tender &quot;Betsey&quot;. While serving on he took a prominent part in the defense of the Delaware River.

Barney was taken prisoner and exchanged several times. In 1779, he was again taken prisoner and imprisoned in Old Mill Prison, Plymouth, England, until his escape in 1781. He wrote an account of this in &quot;The Memoirs of Commodore Barney&quot;, published in Boston in 1832.

===Battle of Delaware Bay===
In April 1782, he was put in command of the Pennsylvania ship &quot;Hyder Ally&quot;, in which he captured the British sloop-of-war HMS &quot;General Monk&quot; in the Battle of Delaware Bay. He was given command of &quot;Monk&quot; (renamed &quot;General Washington&quot;) and sailed for France with dispatches for Benjamin Franklin, returning with news that peace had been declared. The ship also carried a party of Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter and including Franz Boos.

At the conclusion of the war, Barney was admitted as an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Pennsylvania and later transferred to the Maryland Society.

Barney then joined the French Navy, where he was made commander of a squadron.

==Service in the French Navy==
Between 1796 and 1802 Joshua Barney served as a captain in the French Navy. Between 7 June and 17 October 1796 he was captain of the French frigate . He sailed her from Rochefort to ferry weapons and ammunition to Cap-FranÃ§ais. He then cruised in the Caribbean between Havana and Chesapeake Bay, returning to Cap-FranÃ§ais on 17 October.

==War of 1812==

===Chesapeake Bay Flotilla===

At the outbreak of the War of 1812, after a successful but unprofitable privateering cruise as commander of the Baltimore schooner , in which he captured the Post Office Packet Service packet ship . Barney entered the US Navy as a captain, and commanded the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, a fleet of gunboats defending Chesapeake Bay. He authored the plan to defend the Chesapeake, which was submitted to Secretary of the Navy, William Jones and accepted on August 20, 1813. The plan consisted of using a flotilla of shallow-draft barges, each equipped with a large gun which would be used in large numbers to attack and annoy the invading British, then retreating to the safety of shoal waters abundant in the Chesapeake region. Barney was commissioned as a captain in the United States Flotilla Service on 25 April 1814.

On 1 June 1814, Barney&#x27;s flotilla, led by his flagship, the sloop-rigged, self-propelled floating battery , mounting two long guns and two carronades, were coming down Chesapeake Bay when they encountered the 12-gun schooner (the former Baltimore privateer &quot;Atlas&quot;), and boats from the 74-gun third rates and near St. Jerome Creek. The flotilla pursued &quot;St Lawrence&quot; and the boats until they could reach the protection of the two third rates. The American flotilla then retreated into the Patuxent River where the British quickly blockaded it.

The British outnumbered Barney by 7:1, forcing the flotilla on 7 June to retreat into St. Leonard&#x27;s Creek. Two British frigates, the 38-gun HMS &quot;Loire&quot; and the 32-gun , plus the 18-gun sloop-of-war blockaded the mouth of the creek. The creek was too shallow for the British warships to enter, and the flotilla outgunned and hence was able to fend off the boats from the British ships.

Battles continued through 10 June. The British, frustrated by their inability to flush Barney out of his safe retreat, instituted a &quot;campaign of terror,&quot; laying waste to &quot;town and farm alike&quot; and plundering and burning Calverton, Huntingtown, Prince Frederick, Benedict and Lower Marlboro.

On 26 June, after the arrival of troops commanded by United States Army Colonel Decius Wadsworth, and United States Marine Corps Captain Samuel Miller, Barney attempted a breakout. A simultaneous attack from land and sea on the blockading frigates at the mouth of St. Leonard&#x27;s creek allowed the flotilla to move out of the creek and up-river to Benedict, Maryland, though Barney had to scuttle gunboats No. 137 and 138 in the creek. The British entered the then-abandoned creek and burned the town of St. Leonard, Maryland.

The British, under the command of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane then moved up the Patuxent, preparing for a landing at Benedict. Concerned that Barney&#x27;s flotilla could fall into British hands, Secretary of the Navy Jones ordered Barney to take the flotilla as far up the Patuxent as possible, to Queen Anne, and scuttle it if the British appeared. Leaving his barges with a skeleton crew under the command of Lieutenant Solomon Kireo Frazier to handle any destruction of the craft, Barney took the majority of his men to join the American Army commanded by General William Henry Winder where they participated in the Battle of Bladensburg. Frazier scuttled all but one of the vessels of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, which the British captured.

===Battle of Bladensburg===

During the Battle of Bladensburg, Barney and 360 sailors and 120 Marines defended the national capitalâfighting against the enemy hand-to-hand with cutlasses and pikes. The battle raged for four hours, but the British eventually defeated the Americans. The defenders were forced to fall back after nearly being cut off, and the British went on to burn the Capitol and White House. Barney was severely wounded, receiving a bullet deep in his thigh that could never be removed.

During the battle, President James Madison personally directed the Marines led by Barney. (Prior to the battle, Madison had narrowly avoided capture.) This battle is one of only two instances of a sitting president exercising direct battlefield authority as Commander-in-Chief, the other being when George Washington personally crushed the Whiskey Rebellion.

==Death==
Commodore Barney died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 10 December 1818 en route to Kentucky, from complications related to the wound he received at the Battle of Bladensburg. His remains rest in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

==Namesakes and honors==
Four US Navy ships were named for him:
* , an American Civil War ferryboat
* , a torpedo boat built at the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine in 1900
* , a , built at Cramps&#x27; Shipbuilding in Philadelphia, launched 5 September 1918
* was a guided missile destroyer, built at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey, launched 10 Dec 1960.
In Washington, D.C., both Barney Circle (a neighborhood on Pennsylvania Avenue, SE) and Commodore Joshua Barney Drive, NE, are named in his honor.

Barney Square, the main drill area between the barracks facilities at the United States Merchant Marine Academy is named in honor of this American Merchant Mariner turned Naval Hero.

There are several sites in Prince George&#x27;s County that commemorate Commodore Barney. A replica of a gunboat of Barney&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay Flotilla today sits in Bladensburg Waterside Park, the Battle of Bladensburg Monument, and Fort Lincoln Cemetery hosts the Battle of Bladensburg Commodore Joshua Barney Monument.

==Exhibits==
The Maryland Historical Society was granted an antique pistol with a folding bayonet, a spyglass and the journal of War of 1812 from descendant Anne Helm Galvin for the exhibit &quot;In Full Glory Reflected: Maryland in the War of 1812.&quot;

<doc id="1152911" wikidata="Q5109768" url="?curid=1152911" title="Christian Institute">
<text>The Christian Institute (CI) is a charity operating in the United Kingdom, promoting a conservative evangelical Christian viewpoint, founded on a belief in Biblical inerrancy. The CI is a registered charity. The group does not report numbers of staff, volunteers or members with only the former director, Colin Hart, listed as a representative. Hart died in March 2024, leaving the directorship vacant. According to the accounts and trustees annual report for the financial year ending 2017, the average head count of employees during the year was 48 (2016:46).

While the CI has campaigned on issues including gambling, abortion and euthanasia, it is most notable for its campaigns against homosexuality and gay rights. The CI sought to retain Section 28 and a higher age of consent for gay and bisexual men, and opposed the Civil Partnership Act, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 and legislation allowing same-gender couples to adopt. It has opposed measures to prevent gay people being discriminated against in the provision of services and goods. The Civil Partnership Act 2004, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 and the Equality Act 2010 were ultimately enacted by Parliament.

The Christian Institute&#x27;s activities was criticized by The Charity Commission in 2001, for breaching rules limiting overt political campaigning by charities, by &quot;publishing a 100-page report, &quot;Homosexuality and Young People&quot; (1998), which argued against reforming anti-homosexual law from a purely political viewpoint.

In 2004, the CI funded a full-page newspaper advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; in support of a controversial amendment to the Civil Partnership Bill. The amendment attempted to include within the scope of the Bill siblings who had lived together for longer than 12 years. The amendment was ultimately rejected in both Houses of Parliament. In response to the advertisement, Members of Parliament questioned the CI&#x27;s overt political campaigning in light of its charitable status.

==Legal actions==
In 2000, the CI became the only group to initiate a court case for an alleged breach of the now defunct Section 28. The case failed.

In 2007, the CI and others unsuccessfully sought a judicial review of the Sexual Orientation Regulations in Northern Ireland.

In May 2008, the CI funded the legal costs of Lillian Ladele, a registrar from Islington, London, who took her employer, Islington London Borough Council, to the London Central Employment Tribunal. Ladele had refused to process the paperwork associated with civil partnerships on religious grounds, and following complaints from other staff she was disciplined under the Council&#x27;s &quot;Fairness for All&quot; policy. Ladele claimed she had been subject to direct and indirect discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, on grounds of her religion. In July 2008, the tribunal found in Ladele&#x27;s favour; however this ruling was overturned by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in December, 2008. The CI later launched an unsuccessful appeal against this ruling in the High Court, and has been refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.

In 2010, the CI funded the defence of two Christian hotel owners accused of acting unlawfully under the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations, by refusing to let a same-gender couple in a civil partnership stay in a double room reserved for married couples. The owners lost both the case and the subsequent appeal.

In 2015 and 2016 CI was part of the No to Named Person (NO2NP) coalition that campaigned against the &quot;named person&quot; scheme in Scotland, the attempt by the Scottish Government to introduce legislation creating a single point of contact for each child, with privileged access to data about that child. NO2NP argued that this would &quot;[undermine] parents and permits the state unlimited access to pry into the privacy of families in their homes&quot; and would stretch child protection resources. The arguments were dismissed by the Court of Session in Edinburgh in 2015. After hearing an appeal in March 2016, the UK Supreme Court stated that the proposed legislation would breach the rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights, and ruled that the proposal could not be implemented in this form. On 19 September 2019 the Scottish Education Secretary, John Swinney, confirmed that the Scottish Government will withdraw the named person legislation.

<text>Sam S. Reed (born January 10, 1941) is an American accountant and politician who served as the 14th Secretary of State of Washington from 2001 to 2013 and is a member of the Republican Party. Reed was Washington&#x27;s fourteenth secretary of state. He retired in January 2013.

Reed received his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in political science from Washington State University. He was elected to the office of Secretary of State in 2000, as one of only two Republicans to be elected to statewide office that year, after serving as Thurston County auditor.

==Early life==
Reed, whose family lived in Washington in territorial days, grew up in Wenatchee. His family later moved to Spokane, where Reed graduated from Lewis and Clark High School. He attended Washington State University, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in social studies and master&#x27;s degree in political science. In 1969 he started the Cascade Conference, which ultimately evolved into the Mainstream Republicans of Washington.

==Career==
Reed was first elected as Washington&#x27;s Secretary of State in 2000. Reed supported an initiative approved by Washington voters in 2004 that created a &quot;Top 2 Primary&quot; in which voters can choose any candidate on the primary ballot, regardless of political party. After political parties filed a lawsuit against the new primary system, Reed and State Attorney General Rob McKenna took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the Top 2 system in March 2008. In 2004, he launched the nation&#x27;s first state government digital archives to rescue disappearing electronic history. Following Washington&#x27;s controversial gubernatorial race in 2004 (the closest such contest in U.S. history), Reed successfully pushed for several improvements to the state&#x27;s voting process.

Prior to his service as Secretary of State, Reed was elected Thurston County Auditor five times and served as Washington&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of State under Lud Kramer and Bruce Chapman. Reed is past president of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS). He also served as an advisor to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission from 2005 to 2007. Reed is a member of the Olympia Kiwanis Club and sits on the Washington State Historical Society Board of Trustees, TVW&#x27;s Board of Directors, the YMCA Youth &amp; Government Board, and the State Capitol Committee.

==2004 election==
In 2004 Reed was re-elected by a relatively comfortable margin of about 6 percent. His opponents were Laura Ruderman, a state legislator, and Jacqueline Passey, a college student.
As Secretary of State, Reed oversaw the controversial 2004 Washington gubernatorial election between Dino Rossi and Christine Gregoire. He also advocated for, and oversaw the introduction of, Washington&#x27;s nonpartisan blanket primary voting system for statewide and state legislative district elections.

==2008 election==
In November 2008 Sam Reed ran for re-election against Democrat Jason Osgood and won with more than 58 percent of the vote statewide.

==Personal life==
Reed and his wife Margie make their home in Olympia. They have two adult children, David and Kristen, and two grandchildren.

<text>Mark Douglas Brown McKinney (born June 26, 1959) is a Canadian actor and comedian. He is best known as Glenn from Superstore and as a member of the sketch comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall, which includes starring in the 1989 to 1995 TV series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; and 1996 feature film &quot;Brain Candy&quot;. He was a writer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1986, and returned as a cast member from 1995 to 1997; and from 2003 to 2006, he co-created, wrote and starred in the series &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot;. He also appeared as Tom in FXX&#x27;s &quot;Man Seeking Woman&quot;. From 2015 to 2021, he appeared as store manager Glenn Sturgis on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Superstore&quot;.

==Early life==
McKinney was born on June 26, 1959, in Ottawa, Ontario, to Chloe, an architectural writer, and Russell McKinney, a diplomat. Because of his father&#x27;s career, he did a lot of travelling when he was young. Some of the places he lived while growing up were Trinidad, Paris, Mexico, and Washington, D.C. He also attended Trinity College School, a boarding school in Port Hope, Ontario. For a short while, McKinney was a student at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he was a political science major.

==Career==

He started performing comedy with the Loose Moose Theatre Company in Calgary, Alberta. There, McKinney met Bruce McCulloch. Together they formed a comedy team called &quot;The Audience.&quot; Eventually, McKinney and McCulloch moved to Toronto, and met Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, who were in the process of forming a comedy troupe. Along with Scott Thompson, who joined after coming to a stage show, The Kids in the Hall was formed in 1985.

After the Kids in the Hall caught the attention of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels, Michaels offered McKinney and McCulloch places on the writing staff. They accepted the offer, joining the SNL writing staff for a single season, the infamous season 11, from 1985-1986, after which SNL was nearly cancelled. Sketches written by McKinney in season 11 include El Spectaculare De Marika (episode 1), Fishermen (episode 5), and One Shoe Emma (episode 14), as well as commercial parodies Drums, Drums, Drums (episode 2), Ad Council (episode 4), and Brim Decaffeinated (episode 16). McKinney also provided a number of uncredited voice-over lines.

The troupe appeared in their own TV series, &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, which was co-produced by Lorne Michaels and ran from 1988 to 1995. Notable characters on the show played by McKinney include the Chicken Lady, Darill (pronounced da-RILL), bluesman Mississippi Gary, and Mr. Tyzik the Headcrusher, an embittered Eastern European who pretended to crush the heads of passers-by between his thumb and forefinger.

After &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, McKinney returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in the cast this time, in the middle of the 1994â1995 season (season 20) as a repertory player. McKinney survived the cast overhaul that occurred at the end of season 20 and was considered being fired at the end of season 21, but he ultimately stayed on &quot;SNL&quot; until the end of the 1996â1997 (season 22). During his time on &quot;SNL&quot;, McKinney had six recurring characters (some of note include Ian Daglers from &quot;Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly&quot;, Melanie, a Catholic schoolgirl, and Lucien Callow, a fop often paired with David Koechner&#x27;s fop character Fagan) and twenty-seven celebrity impersonations (some of note include Mel Gibson, Barney Frank, Al Gore, Paul Shaffer, Mark Russell, Jim Carrey, Lance Ito, Tim Robbins, Steve Forbes, Wolf Blitzer, Bill Gates, and Ellen DeGeneres).

He has appeared in several films, including the &quot;SNL&quot; spinoffs &quot;Superstar&quot;, &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;. McKinney also starred opposite Isabella Rossellini in Guy Maddin&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;. He also appeared in the Spice Girls&#x27; movie &quot;Spice World&quot;. In 1999 he appeared in the Canadian television film adaptation &quot;Jacob Two Two Meets the Hooded Fang&quot;.

In 2022, he joined the other Kids in the Hall for an eight-episode sixth season on Amazon Prime.

In 2024 he hosted the documentary series &quot;Mark McKinney Needs a Hobby&quot; for CTV.

<text>Fredericton International Airport is an airport in Lincoln, New Brunswick, Canada, southeast of Fredericton.

The airport is classified as an international airport by Transport Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 55 passengers or 140 if offloaded in stages.

Part of the National Airports System, the airport is owned by Transport Canada and operated by the Greater Fredericton Airport Authority.

The airport has two runways and is the second-busiest airport in New Brunswick in terms of passenger levels, after the Greater Moncton International Airport. In 2016 the airport handled 377,977 passengers and in 2008 the airport went from 34,078 aircraft movements to 73,330, an increase of 115%, prompting Nav Canada to provide a control tower in 2009/2010. In 2009 the airport saw the number of movements rise by 44.8% to 106,178, making it the 19th-busiest in Canada and the only one in the top twenty without air traffic control during the year.

Fredericton was designated an international airport in 2007 by Transport Canada.

The airport spent $30 million to expand the terminal size by 50% to improve energy efficiency, add more ticket counters, washroom and seating. The expansion began in mid summer of 2018 and construction lasted 30 months.

<doc id="1153078" wikidata="Q7492191" url="?curid=1153078" title="Shearer Schoolhouse Revival">
<text>The Shearer Schoolhouse Revival was a series of Christian evangelical meetings conducted in mid-1896 in Cherokee County, North Carolina, United States. 

It was characterized by what participants believed to be the biblical experience of speaking in tongues. It is believed that this was the first mass outpouring of the Holy Ghost (i.e., with tongues) since the time of the Early Church.

Many of the participants of these worship gatherings eventually organized into what is now known as the Church of God (Cleveland).

==History==
In the 1880s, Baptist preacher Richard Spurling was part of the Latter Rain Holiness movement in North Carolina and Tennessee.

In 1886, 72-year-old Spurling and his 27-year-old son, Richard G. Spurling Jr, (both licensed Baptist preachers), held a meeting on Thursday, August 19 1886, to see if there was interest in starting a new church. The meeting was held at the Spurling familyâs grist mill on the banks of Barney Creek, Tennessee. Eight people came forward and a new Christian Union church was established. 

Spurling Jr held a Revival meeting in his Baptist church in Liberty, Tennessee, during 1892 during which some members spoke in tongues. 

In summer 1896 the CU organised a ten-day revival led by four lay evangelists (William Martin, Billy Hamby, Joe Tipton and Milton McNabb). This was held in the Shearer Schoolhouse in Camp Creek, North Carolina. 

The revival brought a âspirit of revivalâ which continued after the ten days, with meetings held in peopleâs homes. People came from surrounding areas to see what was happening and âmore than 100 persons received the baptism with the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues.â At this point the Spurlings were joined by Methodist preacher W. F. Bryant.

==Controversy==
In 1899, the local churches excommunicated 40 people for their involvement with the CU; they cited differences in doctrine and the style of worship. Both Spurling Jr and Bryant were also excommunicated. Other actions against the CU included burning down their meeting house, contamination of water sources and beatings.

==20th century==
On May 15,1902 the CU changed its name to the âHoliness Church at Camp Creekâ. New preachers were added, including the Quaker Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson.

In 1907, Tomlinson changed the name from &quot;Holiness Church&quot; to &quot;The Church of God&quot;.

==Legacy==

This event predated by nearly a decade the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, which is generally held to be the event that started the Pentecostal Movement in the United States. This suggests the Azusa Street Revival was one of several similar religious phenomena happening around the same time, of which Azusa Street became the most widely known and influential.

<doc id="1153100" wikidata="Q4735153" url="?curid=1153100" title="Alpha and Omega (Bizzy Bone album)">
<text>Alpha and Omega is the third solo studio album by American rapper Bizzy Bone. It was released on September 14, 2004, via Bungalo Records with a bonus DVD that showed behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the album. Production was handled by Anthony M&#x27;Shala Moses, Darrell L. Johnson, Danny V. Jones, Paul Chase, Brian Lamb, Kevin Rowe, Llan, Kenny McCloud, Gary &quot;Geewhiz&quot; Greenberg, and Bizzy Bone himself. It features guest appearances from Prince Rasu, Big B, the late Adrian &quot;Capo Confuscious&quot; Parlette, King Josiah, Hollis Jae, Kevin Rowe &amp; Llan (yon). The album peaked at number 152 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 27 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 16 on both Top Rap Albums and Independent Albums charts in the United States. &quot;I Understand&quot; was released as a promotional single with a music video.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating &quot;While his former crew, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, turned to religion once in a while and mysticism on occasion, Bizzy Bone&#x27;s solo career has been heavy with prophecy and sky-gazing wonder. It&#x27;s driven him for a while now, but on &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;, it has set him on fire. Lyrically, this is the best Bizzy Bone album, but the subject matter and numerous references to Bizzy&#x27;s posse, the 7th Sign Regime, are the dividing line -- hard to follow if you&#x27;re not a fan, rich with insight if you&#x27;re down. All of the guests on the album are 7th Sign Regime members, and if it weren&#x27;t for Biggie, 2Pac, and Left Eye getting their shoutouts on &quot;Thug World&quot;âan inspired interpolation of Slick Rick&#x27;s &quot;Hey Young World&quot;âAlpha and Omega would exist entirely outside the world of mainstream hip-hop. If you even have a passing interest in Bizzy, go right out and pick it up. The urgency of the record is exciting and there&#x27;s a ton of Bone prose to devour. Is it worth starting here for a newbie? Check fiery numbers like &quot;Capo&quot;, &quot;My Niggaz&quot;, and the extremely funky &quot;Sit Back Relax&quot;, and you&#x27;ll probably be swayed. That Bizzy doesn&#x27;t give two flips about current trends and what people think makes him both unique and somewhat unapproachable. Although Alpha and Omega is his strongest album yet, it follows a cryptic rule book and requires a lot of effort for non-7th Sign Regime members&quot;.

<text>The KyÅ«shÅ« Q1W TÅkai (æ±æµ· &quot;Eastern Sea&quot;) was a land-based, anti-submarine patrol bomber aircraft developed for the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. The Allied reporting name was Lorna. Although similar in appearance to the German Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber, the Q1W was a much smaller aircraft with significantly different design details.

==Design and development==

The Imperial Japanese Navy ordered development of the KyÅ«shÅ« Q1W as the Navy Experimental 17-Shi Patrol Plane in September 1942, and the first test flight took place in September 1943. It entered service in January 1945. The Q1W carried two, low-power engines, allowing for long periods of low-speed flight.

In same period, KyÅ«shÅ« built the K11W1 Shiragiku, a bomber training plane (also used in Kamikaze strikes) and the Q3W1 Nankai (&quot;South Sea&quot;), a specialized antisubmarine version of the K11W. The latter was of all-wood construction and was destroyed during a landing accident on its first flight.

Another specific anti-submarine airplane was the Mitsubishi Q2M1 &quot;TaiyÅ&quot;, which was derived from Mitsubishi Ki-67 HiryÅ« &quot;Peggy&quot; torpedo-bomber, but this did not progress beyond the preliminary design stage.

==Variants==
* Q1W1: one prototype.
* Q1W1 &quot;Tokai&quot; Model 11: main production model.
* Q1W2 &quot;Tokai&quot; Model 21: version with tail surfaces in wood, built in small numbers.
* Q1W1-K Tokai-Ren (&quot;Eastern Sea-Trainer&quot;): trainer with capacity for four, all-wood construction. One prototype built.

<text>Albert William Lowe (born July 24, 1946) is an American video game designer who developed several adventure games, mostly for Sierra On-Line. He created the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series. He has also worked as a casting director, voice director, writer, director, producer, background photographer, actor and executive producer.

==Career==
===Teaching, early programming===

Lowe began his working life teaching public school music for 15 years. He taught himself programming during a sick leave. He quit teaching and pursued a career in programming. In 1982 he created three video games for the Apple II: &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Keep&quot;, &quot;Bop-A-Bet&quot;, and &quot;Troll&#x27;s Tale&quot;. He was on &quot;Name That Tune&quot; in the 1984â85 season and was a semifinalist in one of that season&#x27;s Tournaments of Champions.

Sierra Entertainment bought these games in 1983 and Lowe worked for them as a programmer and game designer for 16 years. His first projects included &quot;Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s Playground&quot;, and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, all based on Disney properties. Later, he was lead programmer on &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot; and &quot;Police Quest I&quot; and also created the music for other Sierra games. Lowe is best known for his &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series of games. After Larry&#x27;s success, Lowe also designed other games such as &quot;Torin&#x27;s Passage&quot; and &quot;Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist&quot; (with Josh Mandel). Throughout his career, Lowe was known for his distinctive bald head, full beard, and considerable beer belly, and liked to call himself &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest game designer&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed Lowe in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, chiefly for the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series.

===&quot;Sam Suede: Undercover Exposure&quot;===
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported a rumor in July 1994 that Lowe was working on a new series, &quot;Capitol Punishment&quot;, with the first game being &quot;Bill and Hillary&#x27;s Whitewater Adventure&quot;. That year he moved with his family to Seattle and supposedly retired in 1998. In a 2006 interview, Lowe revealed that he was not actually retired, but had spent well over a year secretly designing a new game &quot;Sam Suede: Undercover Exposure&quot;, an action comedy game developed by iBase Entertainment, which he co-founded with Ken Wegrzyn. Unable to locate a publisher to promote and distribute &quot;Sam Suede&quot;, iBase Entertainment shut down in December 2006. Following this setback, Lowe expressed serious doubts whether he&#x27;d ever reenter the gaming industry again. As of January 2007, the website for &quot;Sam Suede&quot; developer iBase Entertainment listed the project as postponed pending acquisition of additional development funding.

===Later developing===
In 2010, Lowe produced and directed &quot;Al Lowe&#x27;s Comedy Club&quot;, developed by The Binary Mill for iOS devices. He has since been recruited by Replay Games to work on high-definition remakes of six of the first seven &quot;Leisure Suit Larry games&quot; (the fourth entry in the series was deliberately skipped as part of the &quot;fifth&quot; game&#x27;s plot). On December 11, 2013, it was announced that Lowe had left Replay Games and returned to retirement. While Replay Games&#x27; official statement claimed that Lowe&#x27;s departure was amicable, Lowe himself disputed this, stating that the parting did not happen on good terms.

=== Al Lowe&#x27;s Sierra Source Code ===
In 2018, Lowe posted a listing at popular auction website eBay of an entire backup of his own works at Sierra because he noted that Sierra had no intention of ever backing up any source code. Lowe said, &quot;I backed everything up because I knew Sierra didn&#x27;t.&quot; These included original floppies, boxes, manuals and source code for various games including popular titles such as the original &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; and &quot;Space Quest&quot; among others. Shortly after he posted the listing, he sat down for an in depth interview with MetalJesusRocks, a former colleague and ex-Sierra employee where the two had a detailed discussion regarding the entire collection and its ultimate value.

==Personal life==
Lowe grew up in Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Both Lowe and his wife Margaret, whom he married in 1968, are University of Missouri graduates. During college, Lowe played saxophone in university bands, and after graduation, worked in education as a band director.

Lowe is an avid model railroader and a member of the board of directors of the 4th Division of the Pacific Northwest Region of the National Model Railroad Association. In November 2007, he was the guest of honor at the Alternative Party 2007 in Helsinki, Finland and played saxophone live with David Hasselhoff Big Band. He also runs a website, Al Lowe&#x27;s Humor Site, and CyberJoke 3000, a daily joke mailing list.

<doc id="1153192" wikidata="Q1384259" url="?curid=1153192" title="Expectiminimax">
<text>The expectiminimax algorithm is a variation of the minimax algorithm, for use in artificial intelligence systems that play two-player zero-sum games, such as backgammon, in which the outcome depends on a combination of the player&#x27;s skill and chance elements such as dice rolls. In addition to &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot; nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has &quot;chance&quot; (&quot;move by nature&quot;) nodes, which take the expected value of a random event occurring. In game theory terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an extensive-form game of perfect, but incomplete information.

In the traditional minimax method, the levels of the tree alternate from max to min until the depth limit of the tree has been reached. In an expectiminimax tree, the &quot;chance&quot; nodes are interleaved with the max and min nodes. Instead of taking the max or min of the utility values of their children, chance nodes take a weighted average, with the weight being the probability that child is reached.

The interleaving depends on the game. Each &quot;turn&quot; of the game is evaluated as a &quot;max&quot; node (representing the AI player&#x27;s turn), a &quot;min&quot; node (representing a potentially-optimal opponent&#x27;s turn), or a &quot;chance&quot; node (representing a random effect or player).

For example, consider a game in which each round consists of a single die throw, and then decisions made by first the AI player, and then another intelligent opponent. The order of nodes in this game would alternate between &quot;chance&quot;, &quot;max&quot; and then &quot;min&quot;.

==Pseudocode==

The expectiminimax algorithm is a variant of the minimax algorithm and was firstly proposed by Donald Michie in 1966.
Its pseudocode is given below. 

 function expectiminimax(node, depth)
 if node is a terminal node or depth = 0
 return the heuristic value of node
 if the adversary is to play at node
 // Return value of minimum-valued child node
 let Î± := +â
 foreach child of node
 Î± := min(Î±, expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
 else if we are to play at node
 // Return value of maximum-valued child node
 let Î± := -â
 foreach child of node
 Î± := max(Î±, expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
 else if random event at node
 // Return weighted average of all child nodes&#x27; values
 let Î± := 0
 foreach child of node
 Î± := Î± + (Probability[child] Ã expectiminimax(child, depth-1))
 return Î±

Note that for random nodes, there must be a known probability of reaching each child. (For most games of chance, child nodes will be equally-weighted, which means the return value can simply be the average of all child values.)

==Expectimax search==

Expectimax search is a variant described in &quot;Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability&quot; (2005) by Tom Everitt and Marcus Hutter. 

==Alpha-beta pruning==

Bruce Ballard was the first to develop a technique, called *-minimax, that enables alpha-beta pruning in expectiminimax trees. The problem with integrating alpha-beta pruning into the expectiminimax algorithm is that the scores of a chance node&#x27;s children may exceed the alpha or beta bound of its parent, even if the weighted value of each child does not. However, it is possible to bound the scores of a chance node&#x27;s children, and therefore bound the score of the CHANCE node.

If a standard iterative search is about to score the formula_1th child of a chance node with formula_2 equally likely children, that search has computed scores formula_3 for child nodes 1 through formula_4. Assuming a lowest possible score formula_5 and a highest possible score formula_6 for each unsearched child, the bounds of the chance node&#x27;s score is as follows:

formula_7

formula_8

If an alpha and/or beta bound are given in scoring the chance node, these bounds can be used to cut off the search of the formula_1th child. The above equations can be rearranged to find a new alpha &amp; beta value that will cut off the search if it would cause the chance node to exceed its own alpha and beta bounds:

formula_10

formula_11

The pseudocode for extending expectiminimax with fail-hard alpha-beta pruning in this manner is as follows:

 function *-minimax(node, depth, Î±, Î²)
 if node is a terminal node or depth = 0
 return the heuristic value of node
 if node is a max or min node
 return the minimax value of the node
 let N = numSuccessors(node)
 // Compute Î±, Î² for children
 let A = N * (Î± - U) + U
 let B = N * (Î² - L) + L
 let sum = 0
 foreach child of node
 // Limit child Î±, Î² to a valid range
 let AX = max(A, L)
 let BX = min(B, U)
 // Search the child with new cutoff values
 let score = *-minimax(child, depth - 1, AX, BX)
 // Check for Î±, Î² cutoff conditions
 if score &lt;= A
 return Î±
 if score &gt;= B
 return Î²
 sum += score
 // Adjust Î±, Î² for the next child
 A += U - v
 B += L - v
 // No cutoff occurred, return score
 return sum / N

This technique is one of a family of variants of algorithms which can bound the search of a CHANCE node and its children based on collecting lower and upper bounds of the children during search. Other techniques which can offer performance benefits include probing each child with a heuristic to establish a min or max before performing a full search on each child, etc.

<text>Club Nacional de Football (, &quot;National Football Club&quot;) is a Uruguayan professional sports club based in La Blanqueada, Montevideo.

The club was founded on 14 May 1899 as a result of the merger between &quot;Uruguay Athletic Club&quot; and &quot;Montevideo FÃºtbol Club&quot;. Although its main focus is football, the club hosts many other activities, including basketball, futsal, tennis, cycling, volleyball, and chess.

In domestic tournaments, Nacional has won the Primera DivisiÃ³n title 49 times, most recently in the 2022 season. Domestic cups honours include Copa de Competencia (8 times) and Copa de Honor (7 times), among others.

At international level, Nacional has won 9 titles recognized by FIFA and CONMEBOL, including three Copa Libertadores. In this tournament, Nacional is the 2nd best club all-time with 618 points. Nacional has also won all three Copa Intercontinental it has competed in, becoming the second three time world champion in 1988. In addition, Nacional is the only Uruguayan team to have won the Copa Interamericana (two times) and the Recopa Sudamericana. In the latter competition Nacional won the inaugural edition in 1989. Besides, Nacional won a record four Copa de Honor Cousenier, three Copa Aldao, two Tie Cups, and one Copa Escobar-Gerona, all of them organized jointly by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations. Club Nacional De Football is the most titled club in the world, with 162 official titles won.

Nacional is identified with the white, blue and red colours inspired by the flag of Uruguay&#x27;s national hero JosÃ© Gervasio Artigas. While the club hosts some games at Montevideo&#x27;s Estadio Centenario, Nacional plays most of its home matches at the Parque Central, located in the La Blanqueada neighborhood and popularly known as &quot;El Parque&quot;, where on 13 July 1930 Belgium and the United States played one of the two opening games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, and where Argentina and Brazil, among others, made their debut in the FIFA World Cup. Parque Central was also the only venue in the 1923 and 1924 edition of the Copa AmÃ©rica.

Nacional has fierce rivalries with many clubs, notably with cross-town team PeÃ±arol, in clashes known as &quot;El clÃ¡sico del fÃºtbol uruguayo&quot;. Along with PeÃ±arol, Nacional has never been relegated from the top flight of Uruguayan football.

According to CONMEBOL, Nacional was the Uruguayan team with the best international performance in the 2007â2012 period. IFFHS named it as the best Uruguayan team of the 2001â2010 period and the seventh best team in South America.

In February 2013, Nacional reached 60,000 associates.

==History==

===Foundation and first years===

Nacional is a result of the fusion between Montevideo Football Club and Uruguay Athletic Club, 14 May 1899. It was decided there that the club&#x27;s flag should include the three colours (red, blue and white) historically connected to JosÃ© Gervasio Artigas, Uruguay&#x27;s national hero. The club&#x27;s uniform was mostly red and blue. In 1900 Nacional included the Club Defensa and its players, and started playing at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. That same year four clubs governed by foreigners (Albion F.C., CURCC, Uruguay Athletic Club and Deutscher F.K.) founded the &quot;Uruguay Association League&quot;. Nacional&#x27;s petition to be included was dismissed on the thought that &quot;criollo&quot; clubs and their players lacked category. However, the League&#x27;s clubs had to admit Nacional in 1901, after the club was invited to join the Argentinean League, due to their impressive performances in a number of friendly matches. In 1902 Nacional won their first Uruguayan Primera DivisiÃ³n title. The red jersey was substituted by the white jersey in 1902.

In September 1903 Nacional fully represented the Uruguay national football team and beat Argentina 3â2, winning the first international match ever (between national teams) in the history of Uruguayan football (the first international club match ever, was won by Albion over Argentine team Retiro A.C. 3â1 in 1896 in Buenos Aires). In 1905 Nacional won its first international title, the Copa de Honor Cousenier.

In a general assembly which took place in 1911, the populist majority led by club president JosÃ© MarÃ­a Delgado obtained a victory over the elitist minority which resulted in an institutional transformation: the club opened its doors to players from lower classes, such as AbdÃ³n Porte, who would eventually become one of the club&#x27;s biggest symbols, playing in Nacional until his premature death in 1918.
Nacional&#x27;s players started developing already around 1900 a new playing style that introduced a less physical and more imaginative game, made out of fast combinations and frequent dribbles. MagariÃ±os says: &quot;The action of these teams [the British-Uruguayan teams, that is] was conducted according to the purest and standardized virtues of British sport: positional play, long passes, furious shots, and strong physical play. The body was used as a weapon, both offensively and defensively. (...) Nacional, formed mainly by smaller and faster players (...) abandoned the physical confrontation that was allowed back then, and chose to play according to their own possibilities. They chose to perform dribbling&#x27;s, fast and short passing, very fast sprints, and a hectic activity in the pitch.&quot;[]

After winning the 1912 championship, they won the 1915 &quot;Triple Crown&quot; (tri-championship), which included the three major domestic and international tournaments of that time: Primera DivisiÃ³n, Tie Cup, and Copa de Honor Cousenier. Nacional would go on to win the first &quot;Copa Uruguaya en propiedad&quot; (meaning they were the first club to win three championships in a row), by winning both the 1916 and 1917 league championships, also winning the 1919, 1920, 1922, 1923 and 1924 league titles.

At international level, Nacional won three Copa Aldao (1916, 1919, 1920), three consecutive Copa de Honor Cousenier (1915, 1916, 1917), and two Tie Cup (1913, 1915).

===International tours and success===
After two very successful initial decades in the national league of Uruguay and at the regional level, Nacional became the foundation of Uruguay&#x27;s first international success at the world level. In 1924, Nacional contributed players (Mazzali, UrdinarÃ¡n, Scarone, Romano, Zibechi and Pascual Somma) for Uruguayan national representative that won the Summer Olympics in Paris. Nacional made also a substantial contribution to the Uruguayan teams of 1928 and 1930, Olympic and World champions respectively. Nacional is the only Uruguayan club that contributed players to every Uruguay national team that has won international tournaments.

In 1925, due to the success of Uruguay and players from Nacional in the 1924 Summer Olympics, Nacional was invited to make an extensive European tour, playing 38 matches over six months. During that tour, Nacional played against both national squads and professional club teams from 9 European countries. Nacional won 26 matches, tied 7, and lost 5, scoring 130 goals and allowing 30. An estimate of 800,000 tickets were sold during that tour, where Nacional played friendlies in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal. which is considered the largest tour in the history of world football.

In 1927, Nacional made a North America tour, with similar results to the ones obtained in the European adventure made two years before, with 16 wins, 2 ties and 1 loss.

===The show team: 1932â43===

In 1932, football became professional in Uruguay and Nacional formed a team that would be nicknamed &quot;La MÃ¡quina Blanca&quot; (The White Machine). The team scored 28 goals in the first four games of the 1932 season. In 1933 Nacional won its 12th. first division title, repeating the next year. The 1933 championship is remembered as the longest ever, since it ended in November 1934, after a series of final games against PeÃ±arol, the last won by Nacional by 3â1 with 3 goals by HÃ©ctor Castro.

In 1938, Argentine footballer Atilio GarcÃ­a came to the club. That same year Nacional won the Torneo Internacional Nocturno Rioplatense, an international friendly championship. Between 1939 and 1943, coached by former player HÃ©ctor Castro, Nacional won the &quot;Quinquenio de Oro&quot; (five consecutive championships from 1939 to 1943). Some highlights of those times was the 5â1 victory over PeÃ±arol, with 4 goals by Atilio GarcÃ­a. Nacional also made an outstanding campaign in the 1941 season, winning all the games disputed (20/20). In those five years the team played 96 &quot;Copa Uruguaya&quot; games, won 77, tied 9 and only lost 10, made 318 goals and allowed 108.
Nacional&#x27;s superiority over PeÃ±arol during this era is best exemplified by some particular feats:
* Between 1938 and 1943 there were 23 &quot;clÃ¡sicos&quot;, with 18 victories for Nacional and only 4 for their rivals.
* On 14 December 1941 Nacional obtained the largest win in the history of Uruguayan ClÃ¡sico, defeating PeÃ±arol 6Â â 0. (That year, Nacional won all 20 games of the championship.)
* On 23 November 1943 Nacional won their tenth Campeonato uruguayo &quot;clÃ¡sico&quot; in a row.

Notable players of that period include Atilio GarcÃ­a (all-time Nacional&#x27;s top scorer, also Uruguayan ClÃ¡sico all-time top scorer with 34 goals, eight times Uruguayan Champion, eight times league&#x27;s highest scorer); AnÃ­bal Paz (nine times Uruguayan champion and World Champion defending Uruguay in 1950); Schubert Gambetta (nine times Uruguayan Champion and World Champion in 1950); Luis Ernesto Castro (seven times Uruguayan Champion); AnÃ­bal Ciocca (eight times Uruguayan Champion), Eugenio &quot;Pato&quot; Galvalisi (seven times Uruguayan Champion), Roberto Porta (six times Uruguayan Champion), Bibiano Zapirain (six times Uruguayan Champion).

===International achievements===
Nacional&#x27;s international reputation relied on the tournaments played during the first half of the 20th century in the RÃ­o de la Plata region, where the most important international tournaments in America were played before the Copa Libertadores was created. Historical rivalries with longtime enemy PeÃ±arol and famous Argentinian teams like Boca, River Plate, Racing, Independiente, San Lorenzo, Rosario Central and Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, among others, were established in those championships.

Nacional participated in the Libertadores for the first time in 1962, when they were defeated in the semi-finals by PeÃ±arol. They got to the Finals in 1964, but lost to Independiente, and in 1967 to Racing.

With President Miguel Restuccia, Nacional formed the basis of a team that would eventually achieve its goal, with players such as UbiÃ±a, Mujica, Montero Castillo, EspÃ¡rrago, &quot;Cascarilla&quot; Morales, Brazilian goalkeeper Manga, Cubilla and the great Argentinean striker Artime. In the 1969 Libertadores, after defeating PeÃ±arol in semi-finals, Nacional lost its third Finals, this time against Estudiantes de La Plata.

In 1971, coached by Washington Etchamendi, Nacional finally won its first Copa Libertadores, beating Estudiantes de La Plata in Lima, Peru. That year, Nacional won its first World Club title, the 1971 Intercontinental Cup, in memorable matches against Panathinaikos from Greece, with goals from striker Luis Artime. Panathinaikos played because the reigning European champion, AFC Ajax, refused to play due to the violent conduct common among top South American teams during this period. The following year, Nacional won its first Copa Interamericana, defeating Cruz Azul from Mexico.

During this period, Nacional also regained supremacy in the domestic field, obtaining four Uruguayan Championships in a row (1969, 70, 71 and 72), keeping an unbeaten match record against classic rivals PeÃ±arol: between 2 March 1971 and 31 January 1974, Nacional remained undefeated in 16 games.

Nacional repeated its achievement in the 1980 Copa Libertadores, beating Internacional from Brazil in the finals. After becoming South American champions, Nacional won the Intercontinental Cup for the second time, defeating European champions Nottingham Forest from England 1â0, with goal by forward Waldemar Victorino. That year Nacional also won the Uruguayan championship.

Nacional won its third copa Libertadores in 1988, beating Argentine side Newell&#x27;s Old Boys 3â0 in the Estadio Centenario, with goals from Ernesto Vargas, Santiago Ostolaza and Hugo De LeÃ³n. That same year, Nacional would contest its third Intercontinental Cup. In a breath-taking final against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven coached by Guus Hiddink, Nacional would win in the penalty shootout after the game ended 2â2 with two goals by Ostolaza (the second one scored at the last minute of overtime). The next year, Nacional won its second Copa Interamericana, this time beating C.D. Olimpia from Honduras, and the Recopa Sudamericana, defeating Racing from Argentina.

===Recent history===

In most of the 90s the club suffered a financial crisis and obtained few sportive results. It won the 1992 Championship with great performances by Julio CÃ©sar Dely ValdÃ©s and Antonio Vidal GonzÃ¡lez. After PeÃ±arol&#x27;s second Quinquenio (1993â97) Nacional&#x27;s Directive board changed: returning President Dante Iocco brought back club&#x27;s idol Hugo de LeÃ³n as coach to prevent PeÃ±arol from obtaining the hypothetical &quot;Sexenio&quot;. That year Nacional won the 1998 Campeonato Uruguayo by winning both short tournaments &quot;Apertura&quot; and &quot;Clausura&quot;. This was the first time any club achieved this feat since that system was implemented in 1994, having been repeated only by Danubio in 2006â07 season.

Maintaining the basis of its squad, Nacional dominated the national ambitus for three consecutive years (2000, 2001 and 2002.)

In 2005 Nacional decided to restore its stadium, the Estadio Gran Parque Central, where the team has returned to host most of their games instead of state-owned Estadio Centenario.

Nacional is the most successful team since the beginning of the century, having won also the 2005, 2005â06, 2008â09, 2010â11, 2011â12, 2014â15 and 2016 championships.

2016 was the 46th Uruguayan Championship won by Nacional. It was a one-round tournament, which marked the return of the domestic calendar to fit the calendar year instead of the European calendar.

Nacional qualified for the 2018 Copa Libertadores. It was the club&#x27;s 45th appearance in the tournament, and the twenty second consecutive (a new record in the cup&#x27;s history).

After MartÃ­n Lasarte&#x27;s resignation, the club&#x27;s board appointed former star and reserve team coach Alexander Medina as the principal team&#x27;s new coach.

=== Kits and Crest ===
Nacional&#x27;s crest features a shield with a white slash with the following &quot;C.N de F.&quot; written on it. The crest was inspired by the Artigas flag.

The first home kit, used from the founding of the club in 1899 until 1902, utilized a red shirt, with blue sleeves and a blue collar. In March 1902, the team changed its jersey at the request of the AUF, avoiding the similarity of colours with the Albion club and also because the red shirt faded and another of better quality could not be obtained. The new uniform would be a white shirt with a front pocket (which coined the nickname &quot;Los Bolsos&quot; which translates to pocket in Spanish), blue pants and a red sash. In addition, the crest with the initials &#x27;C. N de F.&#x27; was added above the shirt pocket.

In 1995, when Umbro was the kit supplier, three different uniforms were implemented, the red shirt becoming the third kit, with the official away being a new blue shirt with an almost vertical red stripe. The blue tone will last a few more years, and in 2000 a new kit was presented with light blue and dark blue tones, which imitated the format of the Pepsi brand, then the club&#x27;s main sponsor. In 2002, the red kit was established as the official away kit, and since then, Nacional has two alternatives, the red one being the away, and the blue being the third.

=== Stadium ===
Nacional plays most home games at its own stadium, the Montevideo-based 38,000 (and growing) capacity Gran Parque Central (soon to be 40,089), first built in 1900.
It is located in &quot;Quinta de la Paraguaya&quot; a historic place where an Oriental revolutionary leader JosÃ© Gervasio Artigas was named &quot;Jefe de los Orientales&quot; in 1811.
In recent decades the stadium had not been used very often because Nacional played at the national stadium Estadio Centenario, sharing it with PeÃ±arol, but in 2005 Nacional decided to the return to the Gran Parque Central. Since then, its ongoing renovation has allowed Nacional to play most of its home domestic matches there, as well as many international matches. High-risk matches and derbies are still played at the Centenario.

The four stands of the stadium are named in memory of four symbolic figures:
* the official stand, which includes press and VIP boxes is called JosÃ© MarÃ­a Delgado, after one of the club&#x27;s most important Presidents.
* the largest stand, opposed to the Delgado, is the Atilio GarcÃ­a, after Nacional&#x27;s all-time top scorer.
* the AbdÃ³n Porte, after one of Nacional&#x27;s biggest symbols: a player who after being relegated from the team shot himself dead in the center of the field. This is the stand where the organized supporter group attends.
* the HÃ©ctor Scarone, after another historical striker, nicknamed &quot;el Mago&quot; (the Wizard).

After the completion of the second tire of the Atilio GarcÃ­a, AbdÃ³n Porte and HÃ©ctor Scarone stands, the current work involves the construction of a corner structure joining the Atilio GarcÃ­a and Porte stands. Future additions include a third tire on the three aforementioned stands.

==Supporters==

===The First &quot;Hincha&quot;===
The Spanish word to describe football fans is &quot;&quot;, and it was coined by Nacional fans. An employee of Nacional of the early 20th century, Prudencio Miguel Reyes, was famous for his continuous support to the team. The other fans that attended the games started to call him by one of his duties: pumping air to the balls (in Spanish: &quot;inflar&quot; the balls, in Uruguay: &quot;hinchar&quot; the balls). Within a few games, Reyes was known as the &quot;hincha&quot; of Nacional. This is the origin of a word that is frequently used by Spanish speakers worldwide.

===&quot;The biggest flag in the world&quot;===
In June 2013, Nacional supporters displayed for the first time &quot;the biggest flag in the world&quot; as they called the emblem during a match vs. Deportivo Toluca played for the 2013 Copa Libertadores. The flag cost US$50,000, previously collected amongst the supporters La Banda Del Parque The flag, 600 meters in length and 50 meters in height, entered the Guinness World Records as &quot;the biggest flag ever seen in a football match&quot;.

The flag also weighed 5,000Â kg, with 400 people being needed to move it.

==Nicknames==
Nacional is nicknamed &quot;tricolores&quot; (&quot;three colours&quot;), &quot;albos&quot; (&quot;whites&quot;) and &quot;bolsilludos&quot;, later shortened to &quot;bolsos&quot; (&quot;bolsillo&quot; being the Spanish word for pocketÂ â Nacional used to play with a jersey that had a pocket on the chest). &quot;La blanca&quot; (another reference to the white jersey) is less common.

====World Champion players====

In 1924, Nacional was the club that contributed more players to Uruguay&#x27;s team that won the Olympic gold medal in football of that year. It happened again with Uruguay&#x27;s teams of 1928 and 1930, Olympic and world champions respectively, in which Nacional contributed the majority of players.

<text>The Louisville Grays were a 19th-century United States baseball team and charter member of the National League, based in Louisville, Kentucky. They played two seasons, 1876 and 1877, and compiled a record of 65â61. Their home games were at the Louisville Baseball Park. The Grays were owned by businessman Walter Newman Haldeman, owner and publisher of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; newspaper.

== Overview ==

The Grays were undone by Major League Baseball&#x27;s first gambling scandal. The team was in first place in August 1877, then suddenly lost seven games and tied one against the Boston Red Stockings and Hartford Dark Blues. Boston ended up winning the pennant, seven games ahead of the second-place Grays. A &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; story questioning the team&#x27;s conduct was written by John Haldeman, the owner&#x27;s son.

Team president Charles Chase received two anonymous telegrams. One noted that gamblers were favoring the less talented Hartford team in an upcoming series. The second telegram predicted Louisville would throw the next game versus Hartford on August 21. The Grays committed a number of suspicious errors and lost that game 7â0. League president William Hulbert investigated and ordered players to authorize Western Union to release all telegrams sent or received during the 1877 season. All players complied except shortstop Bill Craver, the team&#x27;s captain.

The telegrams indicated that pitcher Jim Devlin, left fielder George Hall, and utility player Al Nichols intentionally lost games in exchange for money. No direct evidence was found implicating Craver. All four were banned from baseball for life, Craver for refusing to comply with the investigation.

Devlin pitched every inning for the 1877 Grays, leading the league in games and innings pitched. Hall played every inning in left field; he was a good batter, and was the 1876 home run leader with five. The original St. Louis Brown Stockings had signed Devlin and Hall for 1878 and went out of business with the Grays after the investigation.

<text>Oak Ridge Military Academy (ORMA) is a college-preparatory military school in northwestern Guilford County, North Carolina. The school is the third oldest military academy in the United States and the first military boarding school to admit girls. The academy is located in the town of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

Oak Ridge was created in 1852 by locals who wanted to encourage education in Guilford County. The school was closed during the Civil War for four years, reopening in 1866. From 1875 to 1914, the school was led by J. Allen Holt and Martin Holt, two professors at the academy. During that period it became one of the best in North Carolina. In 1914, leadership was transferred to Thomas E. Whittaker. The same year, a fire destroyed several buildings. In 1981, the name of the school was changed to Oak Ridge Military Academy.

The campus contains 21 buildings. Notable structures include Alumni Hall and Benbow Hall. Oak Ridge offers extracurriculars that mainly focus on physical activity and military strategy. During the 2019â2020 school year, Oak Ridge had 50 students enrolled. The academy offers 11 honors and 3 AP (Advanced Placement) courses.

==History==

=== Founding (1852â1914) ===
Oak Ridge was established in 1852 by local families in the surrounding community, some of them associated with the Society of Friends (Quakers). The school traces its origins to April 7, 1850, when forty-three local citizens of the northwestern Guilford County community &quot;desirous of promoting the cause of education&quot; contributed a total of $629 for the construction of a new schoolhouse. The school, originally conceived as Oak Ridge Male Institute, changed its name to Oak Ridge Institute in 1854 prior to opening, to reflect that a limited number of females from the local community would also attend the school.

Oak Ridge Institute opened on March 3, 1853, with a classical curriculum of 18 courses and 63 students from North Carolina and Virginia. By 1856 it had 85 students, roughly three-quarters of whom were from places other than Oak Ridge. Through 1861, the school continued to evolve from a local community school to a regional boarding &quot;finishing&quot; school. The American Civil War closed the school from 1862 to 1866, all except four of the eligible-aged students (probably about 100) enlisting or conscripted into Southern units.

The night before the school was set to open in September 1865, the main schoolhouse burned down. The school reopened after the Civil War, but found challenges operating during Reconstruction. From 1875 to 1914 Oak Ridge was led by two brothers, Professors J. Allen Holt and Martin Holt. Under them the Oak Ridge Institute became one of the leading prep schools in North Carolina, boasting business and humanities departments, literary and debating societies, and sports teams which regularly played Wake Forest College (University), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Trinity College (later Duke University) in football and baseball. Several of the academy&#x27;s baseball players went on to play in the major leagues.

=== New leadership (1914â1981) ===

In 1914, the leadership of the school transitioned to Professor Thomas E. Whitaker. After a devastating fire that destroyed the main schoolhouse and the Chapel on January 14, 1914, Whitaker rebuilt Oak Ridge into a military academy. During the First World War, the Junior Reserve Officer Training Program (JROTC) was admitted to the campus and in 1929 Oak Ridge officially became an all-male military secondary school, changing its name to Oak Ridge Military Institute. From 1929 to 1967, Oak Ridge included a junior college program, in addition to the high school curriculum. During the Second World War, 127 of the academy&#x27;s alumni were awarded a Purple Heart, and another 27 alumni earned the Silver Star. In 1972, Oak Ridge became the first military high school in the United States to admit females, which prompted a name change to Oak Ridge Academy, dropping &quot;military&quot; from the name as JROTC participation was optional for girls. By 1981, all students, male and female, were required to participate in JROTC, and the school name was changed to Oak Ridge Military Academy. Oak Ridge was the oldest military high school in the United States still in operation, and the third oldest military academy.

=== Modern day (1981âpresent) ===
Since 1972, Oak Ridge has been a private, coeducational, college-preparatory military boarding school (with a limited day student enrollment, mostly from the local community). It is one of the eight coed military academies in the U.S. The Oak Ridge Military Academy Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The academy is divided into a middle school (grades 7â8), and a high school (grades 9â12). Oak Ridge is the official military school of North Carolina, as designated by the state legislature in 1991. Oak Ridge is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and it was first accredited by SACS in 1899. ORMA is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), the North Carolina Association of Independent Schools (NCAIS), and the Association of Military Schools and Colleges of the United States (AMSCUS). It is the only active military school to have won the National High School Drill Team Championship (1996).

In the fall of 2006, the academy launched their &quot;Campaign for Renovation and Repairs&quot;, which raised $216,000. The funds were used to get a new roof, repair buildings, add fences and columns, and build new additions to the school.

== Campus ==

The Oak Ridge Military Academy Historic District encompasses 21 contributing buildings and 1 contributing structure. They include the Queen Anne style Oakhurst (1897) designed by Frank P. Milburn (1868â1926); the home of Martin H. Holt; Maple Glade (1905); the home of J. Allen Holt; the Oakland Park Hotel (Benbow Hall, 1905, destroyed in fire in 1993); the old Donnell and Holt Store (now Cottrell Hall, c. 1900); the Alumni Building (1914); Chapel (1914); Whitaker Dormitory; Holt Dormitory; King Gymnasium (1920s); and Infirmary (1938).

The district is located within the town limits of Oak Ridge, North Carolina. It is seven miles north of the Piedmont Triad International Airport and Interstate 40, and is approximately eight miles northwest of Greensboro, North Carolina&#x27;s third-largest city. Located on campus is Alumni Hall, a two-story, multi-purpose building that was designed by C. Will Armfield and built in 1914. The building has a 15-bay facade with a tetrastyle portico on its exterior. Benbow Hall is a frame structure built in 1905 to house classrooms. The building was built in 1905 in the Mission Style and was named to honor the longtime chairman of the board of Oak Ridge, Jesse Benbow. The academy also features a small Revival Style chapel on campus grounds.

<doc id="1153298" wikidata="Q702634" url="?curid=1153298" title="The Monks">
<text>The Monks, referred to by the name monks on record sleeves, were an American rock band formed in Gelnhausen, West Germany, in 1964. Assembled by five American GIs stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of rock, which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on rhythm over melody, augmented by the heavy use of distortion. The band&#x27;s unconventional blend of shrill vocals, confrontational lyrics, feedback, and guitarist David Day&#x27;s six-string banjo baffled audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as one of the most innovative rock bands of their time. The band&#x27;s lyrics often voiced objection to the Vietnam War and social alienation, prefiguring the harsh and blunt social and political commentary of the punk rock movement. The band&#x27;s appearance was considered as shocking as their music, as they attempted to mimic the look of Catholic monks by wearing black habits with cinctures symbolically tied around their necks, and hair worn in partially shaved tonsures.

In late 1964, while known as the Torquays, the band issued the self-financed single &quot;There She Walks&quot;; however, the release barely hinted at the music the group would record the following year. With the help of a German management team, they decided to change their name to the Monks and released the &quot;Complication&quot; single to coincide with the distribution of their one and only studio album, &quot;Black Monk Time&quot;, in May 1966 via Polydor Records. Though the album and additional singles issued throughout 1966 and 1967 achieved limited success at the time, they have since become highly regarded amongst music enthusiasts and commentators.

A few days after the release of the compilation album &quot;Five Upstart Americans&quot; in 1999, all five of the original band members held a reunion concert at the Cavestomp festival in New York City, followed by sporadic touring in the 2000s. The band has acquired a cult following as a result of the newfound interest in &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; and appearances on several compilations, most notably the 1998 expanded version of &quot;&quot;. Punk rock bands and acts of other genres from the 1980s and 1990s, such as the Dead Kennedys, the Fall, and Beastie Boys, have credited the Monks as an influence on their music.

==History==

===Beginnings (1963â1964)===

The nucleus of the Monks formed in late 1963, when American G.I.s Gary Burger (lead guitar, vocals), Larry Clark (organ), Eddie Shaw (bass guitar), and Dave Day (rhythm guitar), along with a West German civilian identified simply as Hans (drums) came together as a quintet known as the Torquays, a name inspired by Burger&#x27;s admiration for the Fireballs&#x27; instrumental &quot;Torquay&quot;. Burger and Day had previously spent time together informally performing as an on-duty musical duo called the Rhythm Rockers, which soon recruited Clark and Hans to bolster their sound. Soon after, Shaw auditioned for the band and was reluctantly accepted by Burger. Shaw, a jazz musician by trade, was recruited largely because the band urgently needed a bass guitarist rather than for his limited experience with the instrument. The band first began performing at military hangouts near their outpost in Gelnhausen, Hesse, playing a combination of American rock and roll standards from the 1950s and some original songs penned by Burger and Day to rowdy crowds and servicemen.

After seeing the band at the Maxim Club, talent manager Hans Reich convinced the Torquays to stay in Germany when their military careers came to a close with the promise of work. For a brief period, the band included vocalist Zack Zachariah and drummer Bob Rose; however, the two were forced to excuse themselves from the Torquays because their discharges were long after the other band members&#x27;. Burger solved the issue relatively quickly by introducing the band to drummer Roger Johnston, and, henceforth solidifying the line-up which would exist for the duration of the group&#x27;s recording career. As the Torquays began to rehearse, Burger arranged a one-off single deal for the group at an independent studio in Heidelberg. The single, which coupled the band originals &quot;There She Walks&quot; and &quot;Boys Are Boys&quot;, had 500 copies pressed in late 1964, which were sold by Clark at live performances. This single was later collected on the compilation album &quot;Five Upstart Americans&quot;.

In early 1965, the Torquays began a residency at the Rio Bar in Stuttgart, which they used to experiment with electronics and sound manipulation and expand their repertoire. It was during the rehearsals at the Rio Bar that the group&#x27;s signature style, including abrasive feedback and high-volume distortion, began to emerge. Sensing potential to expand upon their sound, a German management team composed of Carl Remy, Walter Niemann, and Gunther and Kiki Neumann signed the Torquays to promote an entirely new image and hone their ensemble playing. During one of the first sessions with the team, the band decided to rename themselves the Monks, a moniker that was initially met with some misgivings by Clark, whose father was a priest.

===Experimentation and album (1965â1966)===
Under the supervision of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro Fuzz-Tone (and later a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group&#x27;s motivation was to possess &quot;high rhythm and high energy&quot;. He elaborated further, saying &quot;The idea of it was to get as much &#x27;beat&#x27; out of it as we could. As much &#x27;bam-bam-bam-bam&#x27; on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn&#x27;t contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn&#x27;t part of the Monks sound&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s transformation into the Monks was slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial and error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.

In September 1965, the Monks recorded new, self-penned compositions to present to Polydor Records. However, Polydor was reluctant to sign the band to a recording contract until they performed at the Top Ten Club in Hamburg, where the Beatles had garnered attention three years earlier. Much was made at the time of the Monks&#x27; unconventional attire, with their tailored-made black robes strikingly at odds with the prevailing trends among contemporary beat groups. With all five members abandoning their Beatlesque hairdos for tonsures and plain rope serving ties, the band exuded a mysterious aura, while also looking menacingly non-conformist. The Monks&#x27; image was met with mixed attitudes from their audiences. Younger fans were playfully curious about the band&#x27;s eccentric appearance, but conservative patrons were shocked and at times furious at what they considered blasphemy. The group&#x27;s relative detachment from the crowd was compounded by a loud and dissonant &quot;steamroller of sound&quot; intended to challenge and not necessarily please audiences.

Polydor Records was willing to gamble on the Monks&#x27; radical approach, and the band entered a studio in Cologne in November 1965. The recording sessions for &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; brought the band to the edge of exhaustion, as they had to juggle nightly performances alongside Bill Haley and His Comets with early morning work in the studio. Another challenge was record producer Jimmy Bowien&#x27;s limited resources to properly record the Monks&#x27; loud acoustics to four-track tape. The band members had to play behind baffles in separate corners of the studio.

In May 1966, Polydor Records released &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; and the &quot;Complication&quot; single. The striking approach that the Monks had taken on rock music was a precursor to punk rock. Burger&#x27;s bursts of disorienting feedback was played through a heavily modified Vox Super Beatle amplifier. The songs strayed far from the typical verse-chorus-bridge, but their emphasis on rhythm was nonetheless reminiscent of R&amp;B music acts of the 1950s. Lyrically, &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; showcased blunt and paranoid commentary on the Vietnam War, social alienation, and love-hate relationships. Polydor did not release the album in the United States, considering it &quot;too radical and non-commercial&quot;; it was circulated on tape in the country in the 1980s and had developed a cult following by the early 1990s. The band itself re-released the album in 1994, marking the first time it was officially released in the US.

===Changing musical direction (1966â1967)===

The release of &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; was followed by press events, photo shoots with Charles Paul Wilp, and a six-month tour of one-nighters in music halls and bar taverns across West Germany, orchestrated by the newest member of their promotional team, Wolfgang Gluszczewski. Unfortunately, the tour was debilitating for the Monks, and their music often alienated new audiences attempting to catch on with the latest Monk craze. With the album underachieving in sales, Bowien urged the group to capitalize on the popularity of &quot;soft wave&quot; music, particularly the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Although most of the band resisted the idea in favor of protecting their image, Day used the opportunity to introduce his love song, &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, to the rest of the Monks. When the band returned to Hamburg for their second residency at the Top Ten Club, they recorded &quot;Cuckoo&quot; along with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Over You&quot;.

Soon after the release of &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, the band promoted the single on the television program &quot;Beat-Club&quot;, and several radio stations, resulting in the record charting in some German markets. In particular, the Monks&#x27; music was appreciated by citizens in East Germany that heard the group on Radio Luxembourg, evident by the flow of fan mail arriving over the Iron Curtain. Shaw speculated the band&#x27;s themes and idea of individualism were more accessible to Eastern Germans who were unable to express the same kind of individuality. Writer Mike Stax has noted that after the initial burst of publicity for &quot;Cuckoo&quot; subsided, the group had exhausted all outlets on the German music market and by late 1966 the Monks were looking to expand to other countries. The band took their act on a two-week tour of Sweden to positive reception, concluding with an appearance on Swedish National Television.

Upon their return to Germany in February 1967, the Monks learned that Polydor Records had refused to distribute &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; in the United States because of its commentary on the Vietnam War. At Carl Remy&#x27;s recommendation, the Monks were scheduled to tour in Vietnam, and persuaded to incorporate subtle psychedelic rock influences into their third single, under the expectation that it could theoretically expand the Monks&#x27; dwindling audience. Additionally, the management team reiterated its ultimate goal of releasing two more Monks albums to be called &quot;Silver Monk Time&quot; and &quot;Gold Monk Time&quot;.

Following Remy&#x27;s request, the band made tentative moves to change their sound on the single &quot;Love Can Tame the Wild&quot;/&quot;He Went Down to the Sea&quot;. Gone were Day&#x27;s banjo, Burger&#x27;s frantic vocals, and Clark&#x27;s organ, replaced by rhythm guitar, subdued singing, and calculated orchestration featuring Clark on piano and Shaw on trumpet. Monks historian Will Bedard would later deem the single &quot;as uninspired as the LP was revolutionary&quot;. While performing with the Jimi Hendrix Experience in May 1967, there was increasing tension among the members of the group. Day became increasingly irritated by the addition of covers to the band&#x27;s live set, and Burger and Johnston abandoned the Monk outfit in favor of colorful clothing to the annoyance of their bandmates. Despite the Monks&#x27; inner turmoil, the band was still arranged to depart for Vietnam from Frankfurt airport; however, just a day before the flight, Burger informed the band that Clark had returned to his hometown in Texas. Johnston, who had read about Buddhist monks that self-immolated in Vietnam, irrationally believed that the Monks would meet a similar fate at the hands of the Viet Cong. Without suitable replacements, the group disbanded in September 1967.

===Reunions===
In November 1999, to coincide with the release of &quot;Five Upstart Americans&quot;, the Monks, along with vocalist Mike Fornatale, reformed to headline Cavestomp in New York City, an annual event that resurrected garage bands of the 1960s. The three-day concert also featured the Chocolate Watchband and the Standells, and marked the Monks&#x27; first performance in the United States. Critic Jon Pareles of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that Burger could no longer reach his falsetto, but &quot;otherwise they were untouched by time or fashion&quot;. On October 31, 2000, tapes of the concert were released on the live album &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Beat â Live from Cavestomp&quot;.

The original Monks line-up performed together for the last time at the &quot;Rockaround&quot; event in Las Vegas, in 2004. Later in the year, Johnston died in November after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. A further set of reunions took place in England and Germany in 2006 and 2007 before the Monks officially disbanded. On January 10, 2008, Day died from a massive heart attack at the age of 66. Burger began a solo career thereafter, performing mostly with the Monks&#x27; repertoire until 2009. In 2014, Burger, who had been mayor of the tiny town of Turtle River, Minnesota since 2007, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 71.

==== 2009 release of &quot;Pretty Suzanne&quot;====
&quot;Pretty Suzanne&quot; was released as a single over 40 years after it was recorded, backed with &quot;Monk Time&quot;. The song originated as a &quot;time consumer&quot; instrumental called &quot;Paradox&quot; composed by Eddie Shaw and Dave Day. The Monks&#x27; managers took notice and pushed them to take to a harder direction. &quot;Pretty Suzanne&quot; was first recorded in 1965 as a demo. This early 1967 recording was recorded at Tonstudio Pfanz near Hamburg. Martin Christoph of Red Lounge Records discovered a single sided acetate of the 1967 recording in 2007, and it later was released as a bonus track on the 2009 Light in the Attic Records reissue of &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; and as a single released by Red Lounge Records.

===Legacy===
Since the band&#x27;s 1960s heyday, the influence of the Monks has grown steadily: beginning with German krautrock, then followed by successive generations of musicians in disparate genres such as punk rock, experimental rock, alternative rock, and hip-hop, with acts such as the Dead Kennedys, the Beastie Boys, the White Stripes, the Fall and the Early Years exhibiting signs of their influence. Music historian Kelley Stoltz described the Monks in 1996 as a group that &quot;overwhelms the listener with a sound they termed &#x27;over-beat&#x27; - at their worst it is totally oddball freakrock that sounds like a pleasurable argument&quot;. Stoltz concluded the band was an innovative musical act which &quot;outsexed the [Sex] Pistols&quot; ten years before any other punk band emerged. In his book, &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot;, writer Peter Buckley had said &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; has not &quot;aged one iota. If anything, it has gotten stranger&quot;.

In 1994, Eddie Shaw published the autobiography &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; with help from his ex-wife Anita Klemke. &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; has been reissued on CD since the 1990s, and bonus tracks were included on the Light in the Attic Records release in 2009. Lenny Kaye featured &quot;Complication&quot; on the expanded reissue of the compilation album &quot;&quot; in 1998. The song &quot;I Hate You&quot; was included in the soundtrack to the 1999 Coen Brothers film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. A tribute album, titled &quot;Silver Monk Time&quot;, containing tracks by numerous avant-garde bands, was released in October 2006 as the soundtrack to the award-winning documentary &quot;&quot;.

<text>Creepin on ah Come Up is the debut EP by American hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. The album was released on June 21, 1994, on Ruthless Records. In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source&#x27;s 100 Best Rap Albums.

==History==
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony released their first album, &quot;Faces of Death&quot; (1993), under the name B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e. After the group was noticed by Eazy-E, he signed the group to Ruthless Records and suggested the name Thugs-N-Harmony after a song of the same name by the group, and they eventually agreed on the name Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.

==Music and lyrics==
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s first extended play includes the singles &quot;Thuggish Ruggish Bone&quot; and &quot;Foe tha Love of $&quot;. Features on the album include vocalist Shatasha Williams and their mentor and executive producer Eazy-E. This EP is also notable for being the only project Bone Thugs-n-Harmony would release during Eazy-Eâs lifetime. The first two lines of &quot;Intro&quot; are backwards. Played forward are &quot;Heaven in art which Father our, Our Father which art in Heaven&quot; Tracks 3, 4 and 6 have listed, &quot;Keenu Songs&quot; which is &quot;U-Neek&quot; spelled backwards.

Parts of &quot;Foe tha Love of $&quot; (including Jewell&#x27;s backing vocals) are recycled from the Yomo &amp; Maulkie track &quot;For the Love of Money&quot;, from their 1991 album &quot;Are U Xperienced?&quot;. The closing track on &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot;, &quot;Moe Cheese&quot;, is actually the same instrumental track from &quot;Are U Xperienced?&quot;, also titled &quot;For the Love of Money&quot;.

<text>The Ragamuffin War, also known as the Ragamuffin Revolution or Heroic Decade, was a republican uprising that began in southern Brazil, in the province (current state) of Rio Grande do Sul in 1835. The rebels were led by Generals Bento GonÃ§alves da Silva and AntÃ´nio de Sousa Neto with the support of the Italian fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi. The war ended with an agreement between the two sides, known as the Treaty of Ponche Verde, in 1845.

Over time, the revolution acquired a separatist character and influenced separatist movements throughout the entire country such as the Liberal Rebellions in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais in 1842, and the Sabinada in Bahia in 1837. 

It was inspired by the recently-ended Cisplatine War and maintained connections with both Uruguayan leaders as well as independent Argentine provinces such as Corrientes and Santa Fe. It even expanded to the Brazilian coast, in Laguna, with the proclamation of the Juliana Republic and to the Santa Catarina plateau of Lages.

The abolition of slavery was one of the demands of the Farrapos movement. Many slaves organized troops during the Ragamuffin War, the most famous of which is the , annihilated in a surprise attack in 1844 known as the Porongos Massacre.

==History==
===Beginning of the war===
The uprising is believed to have begun over the difference between the economy of Rio Grande do Sul and that of the rest of the country. Unlike the other provinces, the economy of Rio Grande do Sul focused on the internal market rather than exporting commodities. The province&#x27;s main product, (dried and salted beef), suffered badly from competition from imported from Uruguay and Argentina. The people that benefited from these markets were called &quot;GaÃºchos&quot;, nomadic cowhands and farmers who lived in Rio Grande do Sul. The GaÃºchos also lived in Argentina and Uruguay.

In 1835, AntÃ´nio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga was nominated president of Rio Grande do Sul. At first, his appointment pleased the liberal farmers, but that soon changed. On his first day in the office, he accused many farmers of being separatists.

On 20 September 1835, General Bento GonÃ§alves captured the capital, Porto Alegre, beginning an uprising against the perceived unfair trade reinforced by the provincial government. The provincial president fled to the city of Rio Grande, to the south. In Porto Alegre, the rebels, also known as &quot;ragamuffins&quot; () after the fringed leather worn by the gaÃºchos, elected Marciano JosÃ© Pereira Ribeiro their new president. Responding to the situation and further upsetting the rebels, the Brazilian regent, Diogo AntÃ´nio FeijÃ³, appointed a new provincial president, who was forced to take office in exile in Rio Grande.

The Brazilian Army had a number of problems at the time and was not able to handle the secessionist threat. Through military reforms, the mass recruitment of civilians was made possible and they were able to quell the rebels in 1845.

===Declaration of independence===

Pushing to consolidate their power, AntÃ´nio de Souza Neto declared the independence of the Riograndense, or the Republic of Piratini, on 11 September 1836, with Bento GonÃ§alves as president nominee. However, GonÃ§alves was arrested and jailed by imperial forces until he escaped in 1837, returning to the province and bringing the revolution to a head. Nonetheless, Porto Alegre was recaptured by the empire and the rebels never managed to regain it.

Led by the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, who joined the rebels in 1836, and his wife, Anita Garibaldi, the revolution spread north through Santa Catarina, which adjoined Rio Grande do Sul. Without an appropriate port for their newborn republican navy, the revolutionaires aimed for one of the main cities of Santa Catarina, Laguna, which was taken by the rebels but fell back into imperial hands after four months. It was in this struggle that Garibaldi gained his first military experience and got on the road leading to his becoming the famed military leader of the Unification of Italy. The rebel forces were also aided financially and indirect military support by the Uruguayan government led by JosÃ© Fructuoso Rivera. The Uruguayans had the intention of creating a political union with the Riograndense Republic to create a new stronger state.

===Resultant peace===
The rebels refused an offer of amnesty in 1840. In 1842, they issued a Republican constitution as a last attempt to maintain power. The same year saw General Lima e Silva take command of Imperial forces in the area and try to negotiate a settlement.
On 1 March 1845, the peace negotiations led by Lima e Silva and AntÃ´nio Vicente da Fontoura concluded with the signing of the Green Poncho Treaty (Portuguese: Tratado de Poncho Verde) between the two sides, in Dom Pedrito. The treaty offered the rebels a full amnesty, full incorporation into the imperial army and the choice of the next provincial president. All the debts of the Riograndense Republic were paid off by the Empire and a tariff of 25% was introduced on imported charque. The Riograndense and Juliana Republics remained in the Empire of Brazil and are now two states of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina respectively.

As a goodwill gesture, the rebels chose Lima e Silva as the next provincial president.

== Participants ==
=== Ragamuffins ===
All of those who revolted against the imperial government were called Ragamuffins ().

In 1832, the Ragamuffin Party was founded by Lieutenant LuÃ­s JosÃ© dos Reis Alpoim, deported from Rio de Janeiro to Porto Alegre. The group used to meet at Major JoÃ£o Manuel de Lima e Silva&#x27;s house. Lima e Silva&#x27;s home also worked as the headquarters of Sociedade Continentino, the editor of the newspaper called , which strongly criticized the Empire. 

On 24 October 1833, the Ragamuffins promoted an uprising against the installation of the Military Society in Porto Alegre.

Southern Freemasonry, tending to republican ideals, had an essential role in the directions taken, and many of the Ragamuffin leaders were its adherents, among them, Bento GonÃ§alves da Silva, with the codename Sucre. Bento organized other Masonic lodges in the territory of Rio Grande do Sul, which he had been allowed to do since 1833.

=== Empire ===
Their imperial troops were called, by the ragamuffins, caramurus or camels, a jocular term generally applied to members of the Restoration Party in the Imperial Parliament.

== Minorities in the war ==
=== Indigenous ===
In the years before the Ragamuffin War, the indigenous people were seen as a subdivision of the free population and performed the same jobs as white and free men: livestock and war activities. The most famous village is called SÃ£o Nicolau and is located in Rio Pardo, consisting of indigenous people from the eastern reductions.

Like the blacks, the indigenous people actively participated in the Ragamuffin War from the first to the last day. Although the indigenous presence in the conflict is scarce in the historiography of the Ragamuffin War, through the analysis of letters exchanged between the military, the strategic battle plans, and reports, it is possible to verify that the presence of this group was fundamental for the war.

Another historical evidence that indirectly points to the presence of Indians in the war is the population change in indigenous villages during the war period. In the village of Capela de Santa Maria, there was a sharp drop during the war. The same happened with the village of SÃ£o Nicolau, which also witnessed a demographic change with the predominance of older people and children in the village as men in adulthood went to war. The villages of SÃ£o Vicente and Santa Isabel lasted less than three years due to the effects of the war.

However, the fact that the indigenous people participated in the war does not mean that they supported the cause, whether Ragamuffin or imperial, in its entirety. Several indigenous people were arrested after deserting their posts in the army or arguing with the leaders of the troops. Among the motivations for enlistment, the possibility of obtaining uniforms and weapons stands out; since, in cases of desertion, the indigenous people took the clothes and weapons they had received with them.

==== In Ragamuffin troops ====
Although indigenous people fought on both sides, their presence in the Ragamuffin troops is more documented than in the imperial forces.

Both in the campaign and the areas under the administration of the Ragamuffin rebels, there was difficulty in recruiting people to fight in the war, and one solution to increase the military contingent was to resort to the voluntary engagement of indigenous people. They performed different tasks, among which we can highlight the training of horses and fighting on the battlefield, and many did them without receiving any remuneration. 

Indigenous participation in the Ragamuffin troops was heterogeneous. As mentioned before, some indigenous individuals were arrested for disobedience to the orders of their superiors, which indicates that they probably did not occupy a prestigious space within the military hierarchy. However, some indigenous people held high positions and even leadership positions, such as Roque Faustino, a captain in the Ragamuffin army and executed as a prisoner of war.

==== In historiography ====
Despite the immense amount of bibliography on the Ragamuffin War, there is still a lack of works that report the presence of indigenous people in the conflict. These remain obscured to this day in the historiographical production of the Ragamuffin War, even though, in official documents, their presence, both on the imperial side and the farrago side has never been hidden.

A research done at the UFRGS Central Library collection found only eight books that mentioned the indigenous presence in the Ragamuffin War among more than 50 works. Among the eight works, four talked about the murder of the Ragamuffin leader JoÃ£o Manoel de Lima e Silva by the indigenous captain Roque Faustino in 1837 (, by Dante de Laytano (1936); , by J. P. Coelho de Souza (1945); , by Francisco de SÃ¡ Brito; and , by Artur Ferreira Filho (1958)). while the authors remember Lima e Silva as &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;brave&quot;, Roque Faustino is characterized as &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;dishonest&quot;.

Three other works (, by Spalding (1963); by Augusto Tasso Fragoso) comment on the indigenous presence in the troops of General Bento Manoel Ribeiro. Among these books, the one that has a more comprehensive commentary is Fragoso&#x27;s, where, in his description of the victory of Bento Manoel&#x27;s loyalist troops in the combat of Passo do RosÃ¡rio, he emphasizes the existence of infantry composed of 80 GuaranÃ­ and, lists in a footnote, that in Bento Manoel&#x27;s forces during the Fanfa battle, an infantry unit, and a lancer unit was coming from the missions and, therefore, presenting a high probability of being composed of GuaranÃ­s.

It is possible that even in the early 19th century, the indigenous population was almost nonexistent in the region, as a result of ethnic cleansing taken into effect against Charruas, Guenoas, and Minuanos on orders from Montevideo and the earlier Spanish rule on previous decades. Guaranies were almost extinct after the taking of Misiones Orientales by the Portuguese in 1801, when many fled to the other side of the Uruguay River.

=== Afro-Brazilian ===
Afro-Brazilian people during the Ragamuffin War were fundamental and had an active participation throughout the entire conflict. It is estimated that in all, they would represent one third to one half of the republican army. Later, they were integrated into the ragtag groups in the cavalry or infantry. The first was created on 12 September 1836 and the second on 31 August 1838. On 31 August 1838, 426 combatants joined the army.

They were recruited from among peasant slaves and tamers from Serra dos Tapes and Serra do Herval, located between the municipalities of CanguÃ§u, Piratini, CaÃ§apava, Encruzilhada and Arroio Grande, with the promise of liberation after the victory of the Ragamuffins. At first, they were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joaquim Pedro Soares, later they were led by Major Joaquim Teixeira Nunes.

Afro-Brazilians played a prominent role in national confrontations, such as the capture of Porto Alegre in 1835 and of Pelotas in April 1836. The groups were composed of Afro-Brazilians and freed slaves, indigenous, mestizos and escaped slaves from other countries, mainly Uruguay. In addition to being soldiers and great defenders of the rags, the Afro-Brazilians also worked as drovers, messengers, campeiros and helped in the manufacture of gunpowder and in the cultivation of tobacco and yerba mate, appreciated by the group.

==Legacy==
The Brazilian Army reorganized itself to be a proper fighting force during the Ragamuffin War. The military defeated insurgencies that rose up during the Imperial Era of Brazil. However, this reformed military would prove disastrous against the Emperor when they rebelled to create a Republic.

<text>Lupita Ferrer (born December 6, 1947) is a Venezuelan theater, film and television actress. She is known as a &quot;Queen&quot; of telenovelas and one of the most famous Spanish-speaking telenovela actresses of all time.

==Biography==
Ferrer was born as Yolanda Guadalupe Ferrer in Maracaibo to Spanish immigrant parents. She became known for her beauty (especially her large and expressive eyes) and her strong theatrical presence.

Ferrer has a theatrical background. She started at the age of 15 performing in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Ofelia. At the age of 18, then Venezuelan President Raul Leoni saw her performing in the piece &quot;Dona Rosita La Soltera&quot; (&quot;Dona Rosita, the single one&quot;), and was greatly impressed by her talent.

In the 1960s Ferrer worked in many Mexican and Venezuelan-Mexican film co-productions next to actors like Mario Moreno &quot;Cantinflas&quot;, and during the 1970s worked in Hollywood movies sharing the screen with actors like Tony Curtis.

Her first telenovelas were &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, about a blind young woman, &quot;Mariana de la Noche&quot; (1975), about the forbidden love of Mariana Montenegro and Ignacio Lugo Navarro (JosÃ© Bardina), &quot;MarÃ­a Teresa&quot;, a woman who goes insane after the loss of her little daughter, &quot;La Zulianita&quot;, &quot;Pecados Ajenos, &quot;and &quot;Cristal&quot;.

She lives in Miami.

She was married to the American film director Hall Bartlett for four years, who cast her alongside Anthony Quinn and the legendary Dolores del RÃ­o in his film &quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot; (1978), better known for its Grammy award winning musical score by Chuck Mangione.

In 1985 she starred in a hugely successful telenovela produced in Venezuela by Radio Caracas Television named &quot;Cristal&quot; where she impersonates Victoria Ascanio, a very humble girl who after a brief forced encounter with a priest-to-be young man gets pregnant and is forced to leave her baby girl away after delivering her. Years after she comes back as the owner of a high couture clothes designing company which she rules with an iron fist. She hires a very beautiful girl who, after many plot devices applied, she discovers is her long lost daughter, whose estrangement make Victoria feel guilty and bittered. Cristal was a big success in South America, the U.S., Europe and Asia and was dubbed in many languages.

In 2006, Ferrer made a comeback in the American drama series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, in which she played an actress in a telenovela who gets into a fight with a nurse on the show played by (&quot;Ugly Betty&quot; series creator) Salma Hayek. In 2007, Ferrer participated in Telemundo&#x27;s Pecados Ajenos, which has since become a cult classic, as the main villain, the evil Agata Mercenario. In 2010, Ferrer participated in Univision Studios - Eva Luna as Justa ValdÃ©z. In 2012, Ferrer also acted a telenovela by the name &quot;Rosa Diamante&quot; (Precious Rose), playing the character Rosaura Sotomayor. In this telenovela, she played alongside Carla Hernandez who was her long lost daughter after she had abandoned her at a boarding school.

<doc id="1153369" wikidata="Q1757976" url="?curid=1153369" title="Thug World Order">
<text>Thug World Order is the fifth studio album by American hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, released on October 29, 2002, and the group&#x27;s final album for Ruthless Records. Singles released were &quot;Money, Money&quot;, &quot;Get Up &amp; Get It&quot; (featuring 3LW), and &quot;Home&quot; featuring Phil Collins, which charted in the UK.

Flesh-n-Bone did not appear on the album due to his incarceration on weapons charges though he does appear on the closing skit with DJ U-Neek, while Bizzy Bone was ejected from the group after the album&#x27;s release.

==Critical reception==

Like their previous effort &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot;, &quot;Thug World Order&quot; received more favorable to positive reviews from music critics. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic gave the album two and a half stars out of a possible five, stating &quot;Bone Thugs-N-Harmony are a good example of a group that has become little more than a brand name as its various members devote more of their time to solo projects. Thug World Order is only their fourth proper album in seven years, although many solo albums and recordings by other configurations have emerged during the period. By now, however, every album by the group seems like a reunion effort, their last one being dubbed BTNHResurrection, while, on this album, one of the members mutters unconvincingly, &quot;I ain&#x27;t gonna say we back, &#x27;cause we never left...&quot; The group&#x27;s musical approach hasn&#x27;t changed much, its raps offset by vocal harmonies and its musical beds anchored by samples as surprising as Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;Take Me Home.&quot; Lyrically, their concerns are also much the same, extending from boasting and reflections on life in the &#x27;hood to complaints about low-quality drugs (&quot;Bad Weed Blues&quot;) and the duplicitousness of women with whom they have had sex (&quot;Not My Baby&quot;). But their attention seems distracted, especially when they interrupt the proceedings with commercials for their upcoming solo projects, and the album&#x27;s disappointing initial commercial reception suggested that their audience wasn&#x27;t paying close attention, either.&quot; Jon Caramanica gave the album a positive &quot;B&quot; rating stating &quot;âHow many thugs get down like us and still harmonize like the great Temptations?â the Cleveland foursome wonder on âGuess Whoâs Back.â Bone Thugs-N-Harmony have crooned lazy, tuneful hip-hop for a decade, and their fifth CD continues the psychedelia apace. They are the rare rappers who can sample Phil Collins, drop a Jeffrey Osborne riff, and praise God without seeming a bit less hard.&quot; Rolling Stone rated the album three and a half stars out of five.

<doc id="1153379" wikidata="Q2441260" url="?curid=1153379" title="Toontown Online">
<text>Toontown Online, commonly known as Toontown, was a 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based on a cartoon animal world, developed by Disney&#x27;s Virtual Reality Studio and Schell Games, and published by The Walt Disney Company. 

Players played as anthropomorphized animals, known as Toons, to explore a cartoon world, complete quests (&quot;ToonTasks&quot;), and engage in combat against the Cogs, robot businessmen who served as the game&#x27;s antagonists. Players used weapons known as &quot;Gags&quot;âtypically slapstick comedy items, such as a thrown cream pieâin combat.

Various servers hosting &quot;Toontown Online&quot; were shut down throughout the game&#x27;s tenure; the primary U.S. servers and the game itself were ultimately closed in September 2013. Various fan servers have since been created using most of the game&#x27;s original assets; the most popular of these, &quot;Toontown Rewritten&quot;, was created less than a week after &quot;Toontown Online&quot;â³s closure.
== Gameplay ==
=== Toons ===
Players&#x27; characters were called &quot;Toons&quot;, anthropomorphized animals in the style of Disney cartoons. Players were able to customize their Toons in various shapes, colors, clothes, and sizes, as well as their species, with choices consisting of cats, dogs, ducks, mice, pigs, rabbits, bears, horses, and monkeys.

=== Combat ===
Cogs were the antagonists in-game, stylized to be corporate robots that wanted to take over the town to propagate business culture. Cogs came in four types: brown-clad Bossbots, blue-clad Lawbots, green-clad Cashbots, and maroon-clad Sellbots, each with increasing levels throughout the game that increased their health and damage.

Toons began with basic &#x27;Gags&#x27; and a 15-point &#x27;Laff&#x27; meter and had a maximum of 137 point Laff meter at the end of the game. Gags, rooted in old cartoon slapstick humor, were weapons used to destroy the Cogs in Cog battles. Each &#x27;Gag track&#x27; had Gags with different properties that could be unlocked by completing &#x27;ToonTasks&#x27; and each gag track would get progressively more powerful as Toons used their gags more. The Laff meter functioned as a health meter, representing how much damage Toons could take from the Cogs before going &#x27;sad&#x27; â in-game defeat. Cogs were battled using a timed turn-based combat system with up to four Toons in a battle. Cogs could be fought on the streets of the game, in &#x27;Cog Buildings&#x27; or in their own designated &#x27;Cog HQ&#x27;, with each Cog HQ having a boss that could only be fought by obtaining a full set of the HQ&#x27;s Cog disguise. These include the Senior V.P. (Vice President, Sellbot HQ), C.F.O. (Chief Financial Officer, Cashbot HQ) C.J. (Chief Justice, Lawbot HQ), and C.E.O. (Chief Executive Officer, Bossbot HQ).
=== Non-combat activities ===
Playgrounds were the only areas of Toontown permanently safe from Cogs. In the playgrounds, Toons could regain lost Laff Points, receive or complete ToonTasks unique to each playground, purchase gags, play trolley games, go fishing, kart racing, or golfing. By completing ToonTasks, Toons would grow in strength through additional Laff Points or new Gags. Laff Point increases were also available through fishing, racing, and golfing challenges. There was a playground in each neighborhood of Toontown. Each playground featured one of Disney&#x27;s classic animated characters as a non-player character. The main playgrounds were Toontown Central, Daisy Gardens, Donald&#x27;s Dock, Minnie&#x27;s Melodyland, The Brrrgh, and Donald&#x27;s Dreamland, along with extra playgrounds such as Goofy Speedway and Chip &#x27;n Dale&#x27;s Acorn Acres.

Every &quot;Toontown Online&quot; account came with a player&#x27;s estate. Each estate consisted of a fishing pond and six houses for each Toon on the player&#x27;s account. Players could customize their Toon&#x27;s appearance and home with objects ordered from the in-game catalog (&#x27;Clarabelle&#x27;s Cattlelog&#x27;) by using jellybeans, the in-game currency. Wardrobes and accessory trunks held clothing and accessories that were not currently being worn by the player&#x27;s Toon. Other elements of estates included Doodles (pets), gardening, fishing, and the ability to purchase various types of in-game items from Clarabelle&#x27;s Cattlelog.

=== Online safety features ===
&quot;Toontown Online&quot; was marketed and developed for players of all ages, which is why a chat restriction was placed on the game. Players could initially only chat using &quot;SpeedChat&quot;, a list of pre-approved phrases set by Disney that the player could select. It included general English phrases, in-game strategy phrases, and, occasionally, seasonal phrases. Players could purchase more SpeedChat phrases using, most of the time, 100 jellybeans. &quot;SpeedChat Plus&quot; and &quot;Secret Friends&quot;, later renamed to &quot;True Friends&quot;, were introduced sometime after the game&#x27;s release, which had to be enabled using a parental account if the player was under 13 years of age. SpeedChat Plus allowed the player to type their messages against a word filter developed by Disney; if a word was not allowed, it was replaced with an onomatopoeia of that player&#x27;s Toon&#x27;s species. True Friends allowed players to chat with a less restrictive filter with certain friends who have shared a &quot;True Friend code&quot; with each other.

=== Parties ===
Parties were hostable, plannable, and customizable events by Toons. Toons would use their stored jellybeans in their bank to customize and add content to their parties, such as fireworks, minigames (Tug-O-War, etc.), trampolines, party cannons, etc. To plan a party, Toons would go to a Toon Party Planner. Toons could also customize their invitations to these parties.

== Distribution ==
=== CD-ROM ===
Platform Publishing, a subsidiary company of Sony Online Entertainment that publishes games for third-party developers, acquired rights to publish a CD version of &quot;Toontown Online&quot; in August 2005 for the PC and their intention to bring the game to online game consoles. &quot;Toontown Online&quot; became available on CD for the PC on October 3 of the same year. This allowed players to play the game without downloading it onto their storage devices. This version came in a box set with two months of subscription, a poster, a game manual, and an in-game bonus. &quot;Toontown Online&quot; chose to create a CD that could be purchased in stores, due to customer insecurity when downloading and buying things online that they could not physically hold.

== Closure ==
After ten years of operation, &quot;Toontown Online&quot; was shut down permanently on September 19, 2013. After the announcement, every player was given membership for the remaining time of the game. Seasonal and holiday celebrations and special in-game events took place in the time remaining. Recurring paid memberships were automatically canceled. Memberships could no longer be purchased, and accounts could no longer be created after the fact. The website was also updated with a closing FAQ.

After the game&#x27;s closure, &quot;Toontown&quot;â³s website was updated with a new FAQ to help with billing support and inform users about the game&#x27;s closure. &quot;Toontown&quot; site, toontown.go.com, now redirects to Disney&#x27;s main site, disney.com.
In response to the closure, former players have created multiple private servers of &quot;Toontown Online&quot; that are free-to-play and not monetized. The most popular server, &quot;Toontown Rewritten&quot;, is described by its developers as a fan-made revival of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Toontown Online&quot;, created using publicly available downloads and information made freely available to the general public in September 2014.

Jesse Schell, the former Creative Director of the Walt Disney Imagineering Virtual Reality Studio, hinted that &quot;Toontown Online&quot; closed due to becoming unsustainable in its business model (subscription-based downloadable RPG). Schell confirmed that Disney wanted to port the game to mobile devices but was waiting for a working business model for self-sustaining, constantly-updating mobile RPGs. Schell also stated that the company has hosted internal meetings discussing the future of the game, taking the popularity of mobile games, and the payment options available on that platform into consideration for planning the next step for the &quot;Toontown&quot; license. A solution has yet to be agreed upon, but according to Schell these internal meetings continued into 2016.

In June 2021, seven years after the game&#x27;s closure, an unofficial archive of &quot;Toontown Online&quot; titled the &quot;Toontown Preservation Project&quot; was released by &quot;Toontown Rewritten&quot;. The archive, hosted on Toontown Rewritten&#x27;s Notion board, showcases original design documents and artwork donated by the game&#x27;s developers, along with promotional materials including digital downloads, merchandise, newsletters, trading cards, and websites.

== ToonFest ==
Disney organized two real-life gatherings for &quot;Toontown&quot; fans called ToonFest. These included themed activities and games, trivia and costume contests, previews of upcoming features for the game, and developer Q&amp;A panels. The first gathering, ToonFest 2006, was held at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California. The second gathering, ToonFest 2007, was held at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.

<doc id="1153392" wikidata="Q7522869" url="?curid=1153392" title="Singapore Airlines fleet">
<text>Singapore Airlines has been in operation since 1972, and operates a predominantly widebody fleet, until the second re-introduction of the Boeing 737 in March 2021 following the merger with SilkAir. The airline also operates Boeing 747-400F and Boeing 777F freighters. As of February 2025, there were 163 aircraft registered in the Singapore Airlines fleet, comprising 151 passenger aircraft and 12 freighters.

On May 16, 2023, Singapore Airlines confirmed that it had cancelled orders for eight Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft and swapped an order for three 787-9s to three 787-10s.

==Current fleet==

, Singapore Airlines operates the following aircraft:

==Fleet development==
===Airbus A350===

Singapore Airlines placed an order for thirty Airbus A350-900 aircraft in 2006, with another thirty ordered in 2013. The airline took delivery of the first of the aircraft in February 2016 and flew its delivery flight to Singapore on 2 March. The airline began operating regular A350 services on 9 May 2016.

On 13 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced that it had placed orders for seven Airbus A350-900ULR (Ultra-Long Range) aircraft, which will see the return of non-stop flights from Singapore to both New York and Los Angeles. The first A350-900ULR was delivered to Singapore Airlines in the third quarter of 2018, allowing the non-stop flights to New York (Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey) to resume on 11 October 2018. This was followed by a resumption of the non-stop flights to Los Angeles from 2 November 2018, with a new non-stop service to Seattle commencing in September 2019.

A letter of intent for 7 A350 Freighters (with 5 options) announced on 15 December 2021, for delivery in Q4 2025.

===Airbus A380===

Singapore Airlines became the first airline to operate the Airbus A380-800 on 25 October 2007, after a series of delays. The airline placed orders for nineteen A380s with six options. The first flight was a return trip from Singapore to Sydney, with a flight designation of Flight 380 to signify the first commercial flight of the A380. To mark this moment in aviation history, SIA auctioned all the tickets in a special agreement with eBay, beginning on 27 August 2007 for two weeks, and donated all the proceeds to charity. Close to $1.3 million was raised for charity through the auction.

The airline also uses the A380 to serve commemorative or seasonal flights. Singapore Airlines became the first to operate commercial A380 flights into Beijing from 2 to 8 August 2008 to meet higher passenger traffic during the Beijing Summer Olympic Games and operated the A380 seasonally to Osaka in August 2012. On 9 August 2015, a Singapore Airlines A380 took part in the Singapore National Day Parade as part of Singapore&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. The aircraft was painted with a special livery and operated a special Charity Flight on 29 May 2015.

In 2012, Singapore Airlines agreed to order five more A380s, to be delivered from 2017. They feature new Suites, Business Class and Economy cabins, as well as Premium Economy seats which were already being rolled out on existing A380s. In 2016, the airline confirmed that one A380 would be returned to its leasing company in October 2017 at the end of its ten-year lease, with a decision still to be made regarding retention of four additional A380 aircraft whose leases expire between January and June 2018. The first A380 was taken out of service in August 2017.

In November 2020, the airline announced that it would retire seven additional Airbus A380s due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, leaving 12 aircraft to operate in its fleet post-pandemic. On 5 October 2021, two retired Airbus A380s were towed to Changi Exhibition Centre to be cut up for scrap.

===Boeing 737===
Singapore Airlines operates two Boeing 737 variants - Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737 MAX 8 - following the merger with SilkAir.

====Boeing 737-800====
Nine Boeing 737-800 joined the fleet with services to Phuket from 4 March 2021. The aircraft was repainted into SIA&#x27;s livery, without seat upgrades as 5 of the 9 737-800s were leased and is due to be replaced by MAX 8s by the time their lease expires.

====Boeing 737 MAX 8====
The existing six 737 MAX 8s that have been in service with SilkAir and the remaining 31 on order were transferred to Singapore Airlines. In all, Singapore Airlines will have 37 737 MAX 8s in the fleet. These planes will receive seat upgrades for economy class and will feature a new business class seat.

===Boeing 747===
Singapore Airlines Cargo was established as a separate airline in 2001 to operate Singapore Airlines&#x27; cargo aircraft. Singapore Airlines Cargo ceased operations in 2018 and its fleet of seven Boeing 747-400F freighters was subsequently transferred to Singapore Airlines.

===Boeing 777===

Singapore Airlines&#x27; 777-200ERs were the first to enter service, with the first delivered on 5 May 1997. While Singapore Airlines lists some of its 777-200ER jets as 777-200 aircraft, all of the supposed -200 series aircraft were built with enhancements usually exclusive to the -200ER, with the single modification being the Trent 892 engines derated to the -884 spec used on the standard -200 aircraft, reducing the MTOW and thus aircraft fees at the airport when categorized by maximum takeoff weight (MTOW).

On 10 December 1998, Singapore Airlines took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300.
The airline announced the order of 19 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in August 2004 with the order signed on 23 December 2004, during which an unused option for the Boeing 777 family was converted into an order for a Boeing 777-300ER. Singapore Airlines became the world&#x27;s largest operator of the Boeing 777 when it took delivery of its 58th such aircraft, a Boeing 777-300, on 6 May 2005. It has since been surpassed by Emirates, which as of November 2017 has 159 examples in its fleet. The airline&#x27;s Boeing 777-300ERs entered commercial service on 5 December 2006.

On 9 July 2013, Singapore Airlines, in collaboration with two design firms, James Park Associates and DesignworksUSA, unveiled the next generation of cabin products for First, Business, and Economy class, that entered service in newly delivered Boeing 777-300ERs. The product was later extended to all Boeing 777-300ERs. Singapore Airlines also introduced its new Premium Economy product on 9 August 2015 on the Boeing 777-300ER with the refits completed by the end of March 2019.

On 11 March 2022, it was announced that Singapore Airlines would operate 5 Boeing 777 freighters on behalf of DHL Aviation. As part of the agreement, crew and maintenance will be provided by Singapore Airlines and SIA Engineering Company respectively.

===Boeing 787===

Singapore Airlines placed an order for 20 Boeing 787-9 aircraft in 2006, choosing it over the initial Airbus A350 design. Later in 2012, when Singapore Airlines ordered the Airbus A350, the 787-9 order was transferred to its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot.

In 2013, Singapore Airlines placed a new order for 30 Boeing 787-10 aircraft. On 8 February 2018, Singapore Airlines announced the Boeing 787-10 would initially be used on crew-training flights before commencing regular services in May 2018. On 28 March 2018, the new regional cabin product was unveiled following the delivery of the first Boeing 787-10.

In October 2018, Singapore Airlines converted two of its Boeing 787-10s on order to Boeing 787-8s and allocated the two aircraft to Scoot.

==Future fleet==
===Boeing 777X===
On 9 February 2017, Singapore Airlines signed a letter of intent to purchase 39 aircraft - 20 Boeing 777-9Xs and an additional 19 Boeing 787-10s. The deal also includes options for 12 more aircraft. The proposed order, which is valued at US$13.8 billion based on published list prices, includes flexibility for the Singapore Airlines Group to substitute the 787-10 orders for other variants of the 787 family.
On 23 October 2017, the deal was finalised at the White House and was witnessed by the Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and U.S. President Donald Trump during a state visit. In February 2021, Singapore Airlines adjusted their 777-9 and 787-10 by reducing their 787 order by 14 and ordering an additional 11 777-9. This brings their overall orders for the 777X to 31 and 787-10 to 30. The Boeing 777-9s will be delivered to the airline from 2023 to 2024 financial year.

=== Airbus A350F ===
On 15 December 2021, Singapore Airlines announced that it had purchased seven Airbus A350F freighters to succeed its seven Boeing 747-400Fs. The order contained options for five more A350Fs and included the swap for existing orders of 15 A320neos and two A350-900s. With the first delivery expected in late 2025, Singapore Airlines would be the launch customer for the A350F.

==Fleet history==

Since 1937, the predecessors of Singapore Airlines operated the Airspeed Consul, Boeing 707, Boeing 737, Bristol Britannia, Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-4, de Havilland Comet 4, Fokker F27 Friendship, Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation and the Vickers Viscount.

After its incorporation as Singapore Airlines Limited on 28 January 1972 after MalaysiaâSingapore Airlines was split to form Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines, the airline acquired seven Boeing 707s and five Boeing 737s from MSA on 30 September 1972. Its first purchase since incorporation was for another second-hand Boeing 707 that was delivered on 1 October 1972.

The first Boeing 747-200 for the airline was delivered soon after on 31 July 1973, which also marked SIA&#x27;s first direct delivery of a new aircraft. Boeing 727s were delivered from 30 August 1977, Boeing 747-300s from 29 April 1983, and Boeing 757s from 12 November 1984.

Having exclusively purchased Boeing since 1972, in 1977 SIA placed an order for four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s.

In 1979, the airline ordered A300B4s, its first aircraft from Airbus, which joined the fleet the following year. Other Airbus models flown include the Airbus A310 from 1984 and the Airbus A340-300 from 26 October 1996.

In 1977, and from 1979 to 1980, British Airways operated a Concorde (G-BOAD) which was dual-liveried with Singapore Airlines&#x27; livery on the port side and British Airways&#x27; livery on the starboard side. It was used on the London to Singapore via Bahrain service. The service was withdrawn for financial reasons and complaints about noise from the Malaysian government.

The airline ordered five McDonnell Douglas MD-11s on 16 January 1990, to operate long-haul routes with demand deemed too thin for the Boeing 747. When it was revealed that the MD-11&#x27;s performance was below expectations in terms of range and fuel burn, the order was cancelled in favour of the Airbus A340-300. The cancellation was seen as particularly damaging to McDonnell Douglas due to the company&#x27;s reputation. Several years later Airbus, in turn, suffered a setback, however, when rival Boeing successfully negotiated to take SIA&#x27;s existing A340-300 fleet as well as any still on order in exchange for ten orders for the Boeing 777 in 1999, with Airbus calling the move an &quot;act of desperation&quot; on Boeing&#x27;s part.

In September 2009, the Airbus A380 marked a milestone with the airline when, with the tenth aircraft delivered, its fleet of A380s exceeded that of the Boeing 747-400 for the first time.

===Airbus A330===

In January 2009, Singapore Airlines received the first of an initial batch of 19 leased Airbus A330. The aircraft were fitted with airline&#x27;s then-latest cabin offerings in a two-class layout, with 30 seats in Business Class and 255 in Economy Class. It was intended for the A330s to support the carrier&#x27;s capacity needs until its orders for the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 were delivered whilst replacing its older Boeing 777s. Used primarily on regional and medium-haul routes, Brisbane was the inaugural destination for the A330 on 30 March 2009. In 2011, the airline committed to leasing an additional 15 aircraft.

In January 2016, the airline confirmed its intention to eventually replace all A330s with A350s in a medium-range configuration. On 15 May 2020, it was announced the remaining A330s would be fully retired earlier by 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Airbus A340-500===
In 1999, SIA made an order for five A340-500 with an option for five additional aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered on 15 October 2003. In 2008, the airline re-configured its A340-500s from 64 business class and 117 premium economy seats to an all-business configuration with 100 seats. The aircraft was used to launch non-stop flights from Singapore to both Los Angeles and Newark in 2004. On 24 October 2012, it was announced that the A340-500s would be acquired by Airbus and would see the cessation of such non-stop flights in 2013.

<doc id="1153427" wikidata="Q4717148" url="?curid=1153427" title="Alex Hassilev">
<text>Alex Hassilev (July 11, 1932 â April 21, 2024) was an American folk musician who was one of the founding members of the group The Limeliters. Educated at Harvard and the University of Chicago, he was also an actor with a number of film and television appearances to his credit. As a musician he played the guitar and the banjo and was fluent in several languages. After retiring from the Limeliters, Hassilev remained active in the field of record production.

==Early life==
Hassilev was born in France, of Russian heritage, and educated at the University of Chicago and Harvard. He spoke fluent French, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian and &quot;could sing in over a dozen languages&quot;. After a tour of duty in the U.S. Army, Hassilev did some acting and was credited with a role as singer-guitarist in the 1959 movie &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;. Hassilev has said of this movie, that &quot;unlike most films the horror in this movie was intentional.&quot; He later reflected that he only attended Harvard because [his parents] &quot;considered it the status schoolÂ ... [but].Â ... considers himself to be the antithesis of the Ivy League folk singer&quot;.

In the late 1950s, Hassilev joined Glenn Yarbrough as a lessee of a club in Aspen, Colorado, called the Limelite, and later the two performed regularly. At one of their shows at the Cosmo Alley, Hassilev and Yarbrough impressed Lou Gottlieb, an original member of the Gateway Singers who had also written several musical arrangements for the Kingston Trio. At that time Gottlieb, had &quot;just completed his doctoral thesis on 15th century cyclic massesÂ ... [and]Â ... suggested that the three of them team up to make demos for the Kingston Trio, with Gottlieb himself providing arrangements of traditional folk songs and some original material&quot;. They later named themselves after the Limelite club owned by Yarbrough and Hassilev.

==The Limeliters==
Between 1961 and 1963, the Limeliters made many appearances on television, recorded several albums and toured exhaustively. Early in the career of the Limeliters, Hassilev said that the group didn&#x27;t perform &quot;just any old folk songsÂ ... [but the kind]Â ... that might be looked on as a form of group therapy for unashamed eggheads.&quot; In the same article, however, he did confirm that the Limeliters were &quot;collectors of authentic folk musicÂ ... [maintaining]Â ... that the real function of the folk song is a social function; serving as a comment, as a kind of group reflection on events&quot;. Hassilev was seen at the time as the &quot;dark-haired, banjo-playing baritoneÂ ... a combination musician, actor and linguistÂ ... [switching on stage]Â ... from the guitar to the five-string banjo with the relaxed ease of a virtuoso&quot;. It is claimed that on a national tour with Mort Sahl in 1961, the Limeliters performed for an audience of 125,000 in 30 cities in the United States. Hassilev noted that it was surprising how three such diverse personalities got together and continued to play their music successfully. The author of the same article, said that in spite of violating &quot;the folk-singing code of haberdasheryÂ ... instead of slacks and Ivy League shirtsÂ ... [appearing in]Â ...natty suits, white shirts and dark tiesÂ ... as contradictory as these ingredients might seem against the tested formalae of success, the LimelitersÂ [were] a thumping hit&quot;.

After a 1963 concert in Saskatchewan, a local newspaper said the Limeliters &quot;won over all of the huge audienceÂ ... [and]Â ... were called back for a solid 30 minutes of encores&quot;. It was noted that during the show, Hassilev looked exhausted until he performed the song &quot;The Monks of St. Bernard&quot; in a &quot;relaxed and polished mannerÂ ... punctuated by hilarious interjections from the other two-thirds of the trio&quot;.

The group survived a near-catastrophic plane crash in 1962, and this resulted in Yarbrough reassessing his priorities and leaving the group soon after. Ernie Sheldon filled in for Yarbrough before the group finally disbanded in 1965.

By 1964 with the future of the Limeliters uncertain, Hassilev, while continuing to see himself as a performer, said he was not interested in folk music as a career, instead moving to acting and singing on Broadway â including musical comedy, something he saw as &quot;a logical extension of his career&quot;. He admitted to being confused about his vocal style after the Limeliters broke up and his first solo album &quot;Alex Hassilev Man of the World&quot; was a blend of jazz, pop and folk. He accepted that his new direction might be difficult for his fans to come to terms with, and for it to succeed, he needed &quot;a little luck, talent, self-discipline and a lot of guts&quot;. Hassilev returned to acting in 1966 with a role as a character called Christopher in an episode from the &quot;Get Smart&quot; TV series called &quot;The Only Way to Die&quot;, and in 1966 as a character called Hrushevsky in the movie &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;.

The original group did get back together temporarily to record an album, &quot;Time to Gather Seeds&quot; in 1966. A reviewer said that Hassilev had recorded the tracks using top session musicians at a studio in his home, resulting in &quot;a batch of songs that lack the unity and cohesion that defined the combo&#x27;s former selvesÂ ... [and that]Â ... some longtime fans and enthusiasts of the early Limeliters were undoubtedly nonplussed when faced with the band&#x27;s attempts to revise their image.&quot; The same writer concluded that &quot;during their hiatus, folk music would become diffused as one of the myriad of components informing late-&#x27;60s rock &amp; roll. The Limeliters&#x27; modernization leans on concurrent styles, trends, and conventions. The results were understandably mixed and simply unable to live up to the anticipation or hype of the reunion&quot;.

The Limeliters had numerous reunion tours throughout the 1970s. Despite having only rehearsed for a short period of time, in 1973 their music was said by one critic to be &quot;tighter than everÂ ... one supposed it&#x27;s like tennis or riding a bike - as long as you don&#x27;t try anything tricky, the basic skill stays with you&quot;. In the same article, Hassilev&#x27;s intelligence was described as &quot;vivacious and extremely energeticÂ ... [and]Â ... the way he picks up his banjo - like putting a leash on a trained and trusted dog - makes you wonder how he&#x27;s going to sustain interest in any but the money (and nostalgic) aspects of the tour&quot;. Before a reunion concert scheduled for June 1973 at Tampa&#x27;s McKay Auditorium in St. Peters, Hasseliv said he didn&#x27;t recall playing there with the original group almost 10 years previously, noting that those times were &quot;unsettling&quot; for the group, but &quot;now things have changed&quot; and he was looking forward to the venue. He also explained how the group now had nine members and the show was called Glenn Yarbrough and the Limeliters Reunion, 1974, not that it was being nostalgic, but the band had been added to &quot;back up Glenn&#x27;s voice and to bring the show musically into the 20th century.&quot; Of the reunions, Hassilev commented in 1975 that the Limeliter&#x27;s freshness resulted from &quot;one of our main assets since we began - the energy we put out on stageÂ ... I think this energy and the fact that we are all schooled musicians are the main incentives behind our reunion&quot;.

After the end of the 1973 tour, Gottlieb in his role as a critic, reported in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that Hassilev had been working with Mike Settle and Dave Guard. After seeing their show, Gottlieb concluded that &quot;working with Dave and Mike has had a miraculously rejuvenatory effect on AlexÂ ... his contribution to the work of this unit is evident - a secure sense of form - I mean, a spacing in their arrangements of the presentations of ideas which makes for the greatest possible clarity&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Hassilev and Gottlieb wanted to keep the Limeliters together on a more full-time basis and brought on tenor Red Grammer to replace Yarbrough. The Limeliters asked to perform at a series of Sunday night folk concerts known as Bound for Glory in 1985, an attempt according to Hassilev, &quot;to start making contact with the folk and acoustic music community, which we&#x27;ve never hadÂ ... we kind of shot to stardom and were never part of that whole folk music scene, so we decided to go back to a more folky and socially relevant kind of show, playing folk clubs&quot;.

By 2000 the Limeliters had undergone considerable changes. In about 1990, Grammer left to devote more time to a career as a singer of children&#x27;s songs, and was replaced by Rick Dougherty who was a multi-instrumentalist and experienced performer. In 1996, Gottlieb died of cancer and Bill Zorn who had played for the Kingston Trio and the New Christy Minstrels, joined the group. Dougherty and Zorn left in 2003. After Zorn and Dougherty left the group, Hassilev brought on Mack Bailey and Andy Corwin to take their spot in the Limeliters.

==Later life and death==
Hassilev retired from the Limeliters in 2006, but occasionally made a special appearance with the group. He died of cancer at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, on April 21, 2024, at the age of 91.

<doc id="1153480" wikidata="Q433273" url="?curid=1153480" title="Carol Kaye">
<text>Carol Kaye (nÃ©e Smith; born March 24, 1935) is an American musician. She is one of the most prolific recorded bass guitarists in rock and pop music, playing on an estimated 10,000 recordings in a career spanning over 65 years.

Kaye began playing guitar in her early teens and after some time as a guitar teacher, began to perform regularly on the Los Angeles jazz and big band circuit. She started session work in 1957, and through a connection at Gold Star Studios began working for producers Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. After a bassist failed to turn up to a session in 1963, she switched to that instrument, quickly making a name for herself as one of the most in-demand session players of the 1960s, playing on numerous hits. She moved into playing on film soundtracks in the late 1960s, particularly for Quincy Jones and Lalo Schifrin, and began to release a series of tutoring books such as &quot;How To Play The Electric Bass&quot;. Kaye became less active towards the end of the 1970s, but has continued her career and attracted praise from other musicians.

During the peak of her years of session work, Kaye became part of a stable of Los Angelesâbased musicians known as The Wrecking Crew. She appeared in the 2008 documentary &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

==Early life==
Kaye was born in Everett, Washington, to professional musicians Clyde and Dot Smith. Her father was a jazz trombonist who played in big bands. In 1942, he sold a piano in order to finance a move to Wilmington, California. She later said her father was violent towards her, and she persuaded her mother to separate from him, but music was the one thing that could unite the family.

At age 13, Kaye received a steel string guitar from her mother. She began playing sessions in jazz clubs around Los Angeles. During the 1950s, Kaye played bebop jazz guitar with several groups on the Los Angeles club circuit, including Bob Neal&#x27;s group, Jack Sheldon backing Lenny Bruce, Teddy Edwards and Billy Higgins. She played with the Henry Busse Orchestra in the mid-1950s, and toured the US with them.

==Career==
===Pop sessions===
In 1957, Kaye was playing a gig at the Beverly Cavern, Hollywood, when producer Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell invited her to a recording session for Sam Cooke&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Summertime&quot;. She realized she could make significantly more money with session work than playing in jazz clubs, so took it up as a full-time career. In 1958, she played acoustic rhythm guitar on Ritchie Valens&#x27; &quot;La Bamba&quot;, recorded at Gold Star Studios, Hollywood. Through Gold Star, she began to work with producer Phil Spector, playing electric guitar on Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans&#x27; &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; and The Crystals&#x27; &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot;, and acoustic guitar on The Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;. Along with several other musicians including drummer Hal Blaine and guitarist Glen Campbell, her work with Spector attracted the attention of other record producers and she found herself in demand as a regular session player.

In 1963, when a bass player failed to show for a session at Capitol Records in Hollywood, she was asked to fill in on the instrument. She quickly discovered she preferred playing bass, and found it was a key component of a backing track and allowed her to play more inventively than the relatively simpler guitar parts she had been playing until then. From a pragmatic viewpoint, it was easier to carry a single bass to sessions instead of swapping between three or four guitars depending on the song. After bassist Ray Pohlman left studio work to become a musical director, Kaye became the most in-demand session bassist in Los Angeles.

Kaye continued to play guitar on numerous other hit songs in the 1960s and 1970s, including the twelve-string electric guitar on several Sonny &amp; Cher songs. She also played twelve-string on Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; At the time, it was unusual for women to be experienced session players; nevertheless Kaye remembered sessions being generally good-humoured and united by the music.

Kaye was the sole regular female member of the Wrecking Crew (though she has said the collective were never known by this name, which was later invented by Hal Blaine), a collective of studio musicians who played on a large number of hit records from Los Angeles in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, while at the time unknown to the public, Kaye played bass on a substantial number of records that appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, she played on 10,000 recording sessions. She appeared on sessions by Frank Sinatra, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder, Barbra Streisand, The Supremes, The Temptations, the Four Tops and The Monkees. She played electric bass on Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;, while Chuck Berghofer played double bass. She also came up with the introduction on fellow session player Glen Campbell&#x27;s hit &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;. Kaye later said that during the 1960s, she would sometimes play three or four sessions per day, and was pleased that so many of them created hit records.

Through her work with Spector, Kaye caught the attention of The Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson, who used her on several sessions, including the albums &quot;Beach Boys Today&quot;, &quot;Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;. Unlike other sessions, where she was free to work out her own bass lines, Wilson always came in with a very specific idea of what she should play. By &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Wilson was asking musicians such as Kaye to play far more takes than typical sessions, often running over ten passes of a song, with sessions stretching well into the night.

===Soundtracks, tutoring and later work===
By 1969, Kaye was exhausted and had become disillusioned from doing session work, saying that the music had &quot;started to sound like cardboard&quot;. At the same time, many newer rock bands disapproved of using session players, preferring to play the instruments themselves. She decided to make a change so her career evolved from playing primarily pop music to performing mostly soundtrack work, as well as writing and teaching. She wrote &quot;How To Play The Electric Bass&quot;, the first in a series of tutoring books and instructional video courses. Her soundtrack sessions from this time included playing on the themes to &quot;M.A.S.H.&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;. Kaye had already performed on a number of soundtracks and had worked closely with Lalo Schifrin, playing on the theme to &quot;&quot; and the soundtrack for &quot;Bullitt&quot;. She regularly collaborated with Quincy Jones, later saying that he &quot;wrote some of the most beautiful themes I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life&quot;. Kaye was also a part of Jones&#x27; orchestra at the 43rd Academy Awards.

In the early 1970s, she toured with Joe Pass and Hampton Hawes, and continued to do sessions. In 1973, she played on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s single &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, which was cut live, and was told off by producer Marvin Hamlisch for improvising bass lines. In 1976, she was involved in a car accident, and semi-retired from music. She continued to play sporadically, appearing on J. J. Cale&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Shades&quot;.

In 1994, Kaye underwent corrective surgery to fix injuries stemming from the accident, and resumed playing and recording. She collaborated with Fender to produce a lighter version of the Precision Bass that reduced strain on her back and made it more comfortable to play. In 1997, she collaborated with Brian Wilson again, playing on his daughters&#x27; album, &quot;The Wilsons&quot;, while in 2006, Frank Black asked her to play on his album &quot;Fast Man Raider Man&quot; alongside fellow session stalwart, drummer Jim Keltner. She was featured in the 2008 film &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; along with a cast of other studio musicians. In one interview segment, she said that she believed at the peak of her session activity she was making more money than the US president.

==Style and equipment==
Kaye&#x27;s main instrument during the 1960s was the Fender Precision Bass, though she also used the Danelectro bass on occasion. During the 1970s, she sometimes used the Gibson Ripper Bass, and in the 21st century she has used an Ibanez SRX700 bass. She uses Thomastik-Infeld JF344 flatwound strings with a high action and preferred to use guitar amplifiers in the studio when playing bass, including the Fender Super Reverb and the Versatone Pan-O-Flex. Kaye primarily uses a pick, or plectrum, on both guitar and bass, rather than plucking the strings with her fingers. She also typically muted her bass using a piece of felt on top of the strings in front of the bridge, thus reducing unwanted overtones and undertones. Later she said, &quot;for 25 cents, you could get the best sound in town&quot;.

Kaye preferred to play melodic and syncopated lines on the bass, rather than simply covering a straightforward part. In the studio, she particularly liked to use the upper register on her bass, while a stand-up double bass would be used to cover the low end.

==Legacy==
Kaye has achieved critical acclaim as one of the best session bassists of all time. Michael Molenda, writing in &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine, said that Kaye could listen to other musicians and instantly work out a memorable bass line that would fit with the song, such as her additions to Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;. Paul McCartney has said that his bass playing on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was inspired by her work on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Alison Richter, writing in &quot;Bass Guitar&quot; magazine, has called Kaye the &quot;First Lady&quot; of bass playing, adding &quot;her style and influence are in your musical DNA.&quot;

Kaye&#x27;s solo bass line in Spector&#x27;s production of &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;, was a key part to the song&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; production. The recording is now in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Quincy Jones said in his 2001 autobiography &quot;Q&quot; that &quot;... women like... Fender bass player Carol Kaye... could do anything and leave men in the dust.&quot; Brian Wilson has said that Kaye&#x27;s playing on the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; sessions was a key part of the arrangement he wanted. &quot;Carol played bass with a pick that clicked real good. It worked out really well. It gave it a hard sound.&quot; Dr. John has said that Kaye &quot;is a sweetheart as well as a kick-ass bass player&quot;.

Despite being admired as one of the studio greats, Kaye never expected to be well-remembered. At the time of the sessions, most of the players thought pop music would not last longer than ten years, and she is surprised that people still listen to tracks on which she played. Although the Amazon hit series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; paid homage to Kaye and her career with the character of Carole Keen, introduced in season three and played by Liza Weil, Kaye described the character as &quot;having nothing to do with me or my history. They took a few things out of my book and created a character that&#x27;s not even me at all.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Kaye number five in its list of the 50 greatest bassists of all time.

==Personal life==
Kaye was raised a Baptist, but practiced Judaism in the early 1960s. She has been married three times and has two living children.

At age 13, Kaye took guitar lessons from Horace Hatchett (1909â1985), an esteemed instructor and graduate of the Eastman School of Music who eventually set her up with gigs playing bebop in L.A. nightclubs. At age 16, Kaye gave birth to their child.

Two years later, she married musician Al Kaye and they had one son together. However, Al Kaye, 22 years her senior, had a drinking problem and they would divorce soon after. Kaye&#x27;s second husband did not approve of her job&#x27;s late hours, and he did not like it when she was playing with musicians. They had one daughter together. Kaye divorced him, got a live-in nanny, and went back to working again. Kaye&#x27;s third husband was jazz drummer and session musician Spider Webb. They cofounded a jazz/funk group Spiders Webb, which went on to record the album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What&#x27;s on Your Mind&quot;, for Fantasy Records in 1976.

<doc id="1153485" wikidata="Q12132407" url="?curid=1153485" title="What the Deaf Man Heard">
<text>What the Deaf Man Heard is a 1997 American comedy-drama television film directed by John Kent Harrison, written by Robert W. Lenski, and starring Matthew Modine and James Earl Jones. Based on the 1996 novel by G. D. Gearino, the film is about a man who pretends to be deaf-mute, becoming the keeper of a small town&#x27;s secrets. It aired on CBS on November 23, 1997, as an episode of &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In the 1940s, Helen Ayers and her young son Sammy board a bus in Birmingham, Alabama to move to a better life. Sammy&#x27;s curious questions annoy Helen but she won&#x27;t reveal the surprise and admonishes him to be silent, putting him to sleep. At a rest stop, Helen goes into a bar to get a drink but is dragged into a vacant lot and murdered as the bus leaves. Sammy sleeps through the night until the bus arrives at the end of the route, Barrington, Georgia.

When a despondent Sammy ignores him, the cynical bus driver believes he is deaf and abandoned by his mother. Norm Jenkins, the kindhearted terminal manager, takes an immediate liking to Sammy and is very protective, as is Lucille, the owner and cook at the terminal&#x27;s cafe. Norm sees Sammy and Lucille as his surrogate son and wife as he had lost his own family to the influenza pandemic of 1918. Young Tolliver Tynan stops with his adopted sister, Tallasse, and mother, Maddie, to watch Sammy being questioned by the police chief and tries to spook Sammy by lighting a cherry bomb. Sammy sees Tolliver&#x27;s activity in a reflection and steels himself to not react to the blast, which convinces the entire town that he is in fact deaf. Norm sets up Sammy to sleep in the storage room. Looking through Helen&#x27;s suitcase left on the bus, Norm finds important documents.

Sammy spends the next two decades living in the terminal and working as the town&#x27;s handyman, hearing various secrets from people who believe him to be deaf. Norm backtracks along the route of the bus and eventually tracks down Helen&#x27;s cold case. Tallasse has returned after years away with dreams of becoming a professional photographer. Tolliver is still arrogant and patronizing as the treasurer of the town church. As his inheritance is tied up in a trust until his mother dies, he has various unsuccessful moneymaking schemes, all financed by funds he has embezzled from the church. Sammy hears all of Tolliver&#x27;s secrets.

Black junk dealer Archibald Thacker and his sons masquerade as poor but are actually Harvard-educated businessmen as well as moonshine runners. They scheme to temporarily store a shipment of the liquor in the church&#x27;s large, new baptismal font.

The Tynan house hosts the church&#x27;s newly-ordained and unsure preacher, Reverend Pruitt. Seeing a newspaper article where a rock and roll group claimed to be bigger than God (inspired by Beatle John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;More popular than Jesus&quot; remark), Pruitt is inspired to hold a record-burning event. The event grows out of control and gains a festive atmosphere. Embers from the bonfire ignite nearby fireworks, sending a skyrocket into the church and directly into the font full of alcohol, burning the church down.

Tolliver is put on trial for his embezzlement as the church is revealed to be uninsured. Sammy is called as the first witness and everyone is surprised when he speaks. Tolliver&#x27;s mother collapses and dies from shock. Tolliver believes he is finally entitled to his inheritance. Norm reveals the notarized affidavit he found decades earlier in which Tolliver&#x27;s father identifies Sammy as his illegitimate son by Helen, born just before Tolliver. As firstborn, Sammy is the legal heir to the Tynan fortune according to the terms of the will. Tolliver is sentenced to jail.

Sammy gives away much of his newfound wealth to charity as well as to Norm and Lucille. He boards a bus to begin exploring the country. Tallasse chases down the bus in her car and joins Sammy on his trip.

Filming took place in Wilmington, North Carolina.

==Reception==
In her &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Caryn James wrote: &quot;Nothing seems real in &quot;What the Deaf Man Heard.&quot; Instead, its soothing, storybook quality has Hallmark written all over it.&quot; Tony Scott gave it a more favorable review in &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;Primed with a quirky premise and by charmingly offbeat characters, penned by Robert W. Lenski, &quot;What the Deaf Man Heard&quot; is a joy.&quot;

The film was the highest-rated made-for-television film on any network since 1991 with approximately 36 million viewers.

The film received 1998 Emmy nominations for Outstanding Made for Television Movie and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie (Judith Ivey) and won for Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or a Movie. It also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV (Matthew Modine).

<text>The Congress of Angostura was convened by SimÃ³n BolÃ­var and took place in Angostura (today Ciudad BolÃ­var) during the wars of independence of Colombia and Venezuela, culminating in the proclamation of the Republic of Colombia (historiographically called Gran Colombia). It met from February 15, 1819, established the new independent-from-Spain nation on December 17, was interrupted by further independentist activity, and reconvened on July 31, 1821, when the Congress of CÃºcuta began its sessions. The Angostura assembly consisted of twenty-six delegates representing Venezuela and New Granada (today Colombia).

== Historical background ==
Important parts of the countries were still under Spanish rule, so elections only took place in the areas of southern Venezuela and Margarita Island controlled by the patriot forces. The delegates from New Granada were chosen from among the exiles fighting alongside the Venezuelan patriots. At its first meeting on February 19, 1819, Bolivar gave his famous Address at Angostura, but not all of the proposals contained in it were accepted (most notably the suggestions of a highly exalted ceremonial president-for-life who would govern through powerful ministers accountable to parliament and a hereditary senate, both modeled on the British example, and a &quot;fourth&quot; branch of government, the &quot;moral&quot; one, loosely modeled on the Classical Areopagus).

The Congress of Angostura is considered Venezuela&#x27;s second legislative congress, the first being the one that met in 1811. Its culminating piece of legislation was the Venezuelan Constitution of 1819, officially adopted on August 15, but quickly made obsolete by the creation of the Republic of Colombia on December 17, 1819. This new nation comprised Venezuela, New Granada (today Colombia and PanamÃ¡) and Quito (today Ecuador). In order to differentiate it from the present Republic of Colombia, historians have traditionally called the nation Gran Colombia. A constitution for the new nation was created at the Congress of CÃºcuta in August 1821.

The congress established three large departments for the new country: Venezuela (corresponding to the modern country of Venezuela), Cundinamarca (what today is Colombia, Panama and some parts of Central America) and Quito (today Ecuador). Simon BolÃ­var was elected president, Francisco Antonio Zea vice president, Juan GermÃ¡n Roscio vice president of Venezuela and Francisco de Paula Santander vice president of Cundinamarca.

==The &quot;Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia&quot; (1819)==

=== Contents of the &quot;Fundamental Law&quot; ===
On December 17, 1819, the &quot;Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia&quot; (&quot;Ley Fundamental de Colombia&quot;, in Spanish) was enacted by the congressmen in the city of Angostura (nowadays Ciudad BolÃ­var). It consisted of fourteen articles in which the Republic of Gran Colombia established its political structure, in consideration of the fact that &quot;the provinces of Venezuela and New Grenada (sic)&quot; are &quot;united in a single republic&quot; that could not stand if divided in two different nations, even if they are &quot;united by the closest ties&quot;. Therefore, the birth of Gran Colombia would be created &quot;by necessity and mutual interest&quot;.

Basically, the document explained how Colombia was going to be as an independent nation, in relation to the reasons that motivated the political union of Venezuela and New Granada. The &quot;Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia&quot; was thus as follows:
# In 1819, the Republic of Colombia is created from the fusion of Venezuela and New Granada, both nations with republican systems.
# The captain-generalship of Venezuela and the viceroyalty of New Granada combine their territories, which comprise &quot;an extent of a hundred and fifteen thousand square leagues&quot;.
# The &quot;national debt of Colombia&quot; consolidates &quot;in solidum&quot; the debts of both Venezuela and New Granada.
# The executive power is in the hands of the president and the vice-president, &quot;both to be provisionally appointed by the present congress&quot;.
# Venezuela, Quito, and Cundinamarca are the three great departments of Gran Colombia (this last being substituted for what previously had been called New Granada). Their respective capitals are Caracas, Quito, and BogotÃ¡.
# The departments have superior administrations and chiefs.
# The capital of Colombia is named after BolÃ­var. Its &quot;place and situation&quot; is to be determined by the congress.
# Rosario de CÃºcuta shall be the village in which the congress of Colombia would assemble in January 1821.
# The congress will form the Constitution of the Republic of Colombia.
# In the same way, the congress shall determine &quot;the arms and flag of Colombia&quot;. The colors will be the Venezuelan ones, &quot;being most known&quot;.
# On January 15, 1820, the congress &quot;shall adjourn&quot;; then new elections to the congress can take place.
# The congress shall be replaced by a six-member committee and a president.
# On December 25, 1819, &quot;in commemoration of the birth of the Saviour of the world&quot;, the Republic of Colombia shall be proclaimed through public celebrations.
# The aforesaid date, i.e., December 25th, shall be the anniversary of the Republic, due to its &quot;political regeneration&quot;.

=== Deputies who signed the &quot;Fundamental Law&quot; ===
At the end of the &quot;Fundamental Law&quot; appeared the signatures of Francisco Antonio Zea, who was the president of the congress, and Diego de Vallenilla, a deputy and secretary. Other politicians who signed the document were: Juan GermÃ¡n Roscio, Manuel CedeÃ±o, Juan MartÃ­nez, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Vergara y Lozano, JosÃ© EspaÃ±a, Luis TomÃ¡s Peraza, Antonio M. BriceÃ±o, Eusebio Afanador, Francisco Conde, Diego Bautista Urbaneja, Juan Vicente Cardozo, Ignacio MuÃ±oz, Onofre Basalo, Domingo Alzuru, JosÃ© TomÃ¡s Machado and RamÃ³n GarcÃ­a CÃ¡diz.

Finally, SimÃ³n BolÃ­var approved the printing, publication and implementation of the &quot;Fundamental Law&quot;, with the stamp of the State.

<doc id="1153576" wikidata="Q953631" url="?curid=1153576" title="Earmuffs">
<text>Earmuffs refer to two different items. Both items consist of a thermoplastic or metal head-band that fits over the top or back of the head, and a cushion or cup at each end to usually cover both ears. The cups can either be clothing accessories designed to cover a person&#x27;s ears for warmth or personal protective equipment designed to cover a person&#x27;s ears for hearing protection. 
== Cold weather ==
===History===
Thermal earmuffs were invented by Chester Greenwood of Farmington, Maine in 1873, when he was 15. He reportedly conceived the idea while ice skating, and asked his grandmother to sew tufts of fur between loops of wire. His patent was for improved ear protectors, which he and his local employees manufactured in the Farmington area for nearly 60 years.

===Earmuffs vs. hats===

Thermal earmuffs are worn for protection from the cold. Because the ears extend from the sides of the head to gather sound waves, they have a high skin surface-area-to-volume ratio, and very little muscle tissue, causing them to be one of the first body parts to become uncomfortably cold as temperatures drop. Some people experience this discomfort even if most of the body is comfortably warm, especially during strenuous activity. Wind can often cause the ears to be much colder than the rest of the head. When the ears are uncomfortably cold and the rest of the body is much warmer, using a winter hat or the hood of a jacket to cover the ears may cause the head or body to be uncomfortably hot, possibly inducing perspiration of the head, a dangerous condition in cold weather. Earmuffs can be used to warm the ears only, avoiding overheating other parts of the body or trapping exhaust heat from strenuous movement.

===Types of thermal earmuffs===
There are two main types of thermal earmuffs. One type has a structure similar to large headphones, with a band going over the top of the head. Another type has two round earpieces made from a material that can produce heat, connected to a thick headband going around and behind the head. Some headbands are thick and wide enough to warm the ears, and are referred to &quot;earmuffs&quot; when used this way.

==Hearing protection==
===History===

Acoustic earmuffs are believed to have originated during World War II. Pilots of military aircraft wore leather flaps over their ears, supposedly to protect against noise-induced hearing loss due to engine noise. Prototype versions of earmuffs, composed of a headband and cuffs to fit over the outer ear, were soon after developed. These early versions were not practical due to the discomfort caused by the headbands being tightly fixed against the head. In 1954, an earmuff with a more comfortable cushion design was developed.

===Overview===
Hearing protection in the workplace in the United States is regulated by organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Hearing protection can be included in hearing conservation programs if noise exceeds a certain criteria. OSHA recommends the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) when an employer is exposed to an average noise intensity of 85 dBA over an 8-hour shift. HPD is required when exposed to average noise intensity of 90 dBA or greater over an 8-hour shift. MSHA requirements are similar to OSHA. OSHA and MSHA require the use of hearing protection for workers who have not had a baseline hearing test or have had a shift in hearing thresholds, called a standard threshold shift.
But this does not mean that OSHA considers HPDs to be effective.
Hearing protection earmuffs have cups lined with sound-deadening material, like thermal earmuffs and headphones in appearance, which are worn as hearing protection. These may be carried on a head-band or clipped onto the sides of a hard hat, for use on construction sites. Some manufacturers combine headphones with ear defenders, allowing the wearer to listen to music, communication, or other audio source and also enjoy protection or isolation from ambient noise. For extra sound attenuation, earplugs can also be used in conjunction with earmuffs. The head-band and outer covering is usually made from a hard thermoplastic or metal. The protection usually comes from acoustic foam â this absorbs sound waves by increasing air resistance, thus reducing the amplitude of the waves. The energy is transformed into heat. Earmuffs can be used in the workplace or recreationally for loud activities, e.g., concerts, shooting firearms, heavy machinery, mowing, etc. 

When persons are exposed to excessively loud environments (85Â dB or more), hearing protection devices are recommended to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Hearing protection should be worn whenever power tools, loud yard equipment, or firearms are used. Any noise greater than 140 dB can cause permanent hearing loss. Firearms range from a noise level of 140 dB to 175 dB depending on the firearm type. It is recommended to use dual hearing protection (earmuffs and earplugs together) when using firearms. Exposure to loud noises damages the hair cells in the inner ear that are essential for sending neural impulses to the brain in order to perceive sounds. Loss of these hair cells leads to hearing loss that may cause speech and sounds to be muffled or distorted. Tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss; there is no cure for tinnitus. In the workplace, OSHA requires the use of hearing protection devices whenever a person is exposed to an average noise intensity of 90 dBA or greater over an 8-hour shift. The louder the environment, the less time that a person may spend there without the risk of incurring hearing loss. NIOSH has also developed standards for hearing protection. Compared to OSHA, the NIOSH standards are more conservative in their estimates for safe noise exposure times. Tabulated below are the NIOSH standards for the maximum daily exposure times at various noise levels.
Because the auditory system has varying sensitivity to sound as a function of frequency, unprotected noise exposures to mid- to high- frequency sounds pose greater risk to hearing than low frequency sounds. This frequency dependence is reflected in the use of the A-weighting curve to describe the decibel level of an exposure (dB A). The A-weighting curve weights the mid frequency content, 500 to 4000Â Hz, more than the frequencies outside that range. At lower, non-damaging sound levels, hearing protection will reduce fatigue from frequent exposure to sound.

=== Attenuation characteristics ===

A typical earmuff attenuates (decreases) the level of noise by approximately 23Â dB when tested under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. The EPA requires that earmuff manufacturers test each device&#x27;s performance and indicate their specific noise-reduction capabilities on the product labeling. This single number is called the Noise Reduction Rating, or NRR. The attenuation is higher when measured in laboratory testing than worn in the field, or in real world settings. However, earmuffs had the least variability compared to earplugs. Discrepancies between the field and lab results could be due to improper training of how to wear the device. Experiments have indicated that the actual attenuation achieved by ordinary users of earmuffs is only 33% to 74% of the labeled NRR. Improper fit, device deterioration, and a poor seal with the head all contribute to reduced device performance. Despite these drawbacks, research has shown that the real-world performance of earmuffs is in closer agreement to manufacturers&#x27; labels than it is for earplugs. This suggests that earmuffs are more intuitive for users to wear correctly and in some cases may be a more appropriate choice of hearing protection.

When deciding between earmuffs and earplugs, it is also important to consider the noise reduction levels achieved at different sound frequencies. In general, earmuffs provide less attenuation for low-frequency (&lt;500Â Hz) sounds than earplugs. Thus, in situations where noise is dominated by low-frequency energy, earplugs are likely to be more effective. Earmuffs also fail to provide any noise reduction at infrasonic frequencies (&lt; 20Â Hz), which is energy that cannot be heard because it falls below the range of human hearing sensitivity. In contrast, earplugs can provide some attenuation to infrasonic sounds.

=== Passive vs. active ===
There are two different types of earmuffs used to protect the user from loud sounds based on the acoustical properties and materials used to create them: passively attenuating and actively attenuating earmuffs.

The ability of a passive earmuff to attenuate a signal is based on the materials used. The material and structure of the earmuff device is used to decrease the sound level that is transmitted through the ear canal. Materials, such as a cupped foam coated in hard plastic, will block sound due to the thick and dampening properties of the foam.

Active earmuffs have an electronic component and microphones that allow the user to control their access to communication while attenuating background noise. When in loud, hazardous settings, the wearer may still be required to listen to outside sources, such as machinery work, their supervisor&#x27;s commands, or talk to their colleagues. While the material and design of the muff allows for a reasonable attenuation (roughly 22 dBNRR), the user has the option to allow some sounds in that are necessary for their job. These earmuffs incorporate a volume control to increase and decrease the attenuation.

Active noise reduction earmuffs incorporate electronic noise cancellation or active noise cancellation to attenuate (roughly 26Â dB NRR) low frequency noise. A microphone, circuit, and speaker inside the muff are used to actively cancel out noise. As a signal enters the microphone, the electronics within the earmuff cast a signal back that is 180Â° out of phase with the signal, thus &quot;cancelling&quot; this signal. This opposing signal reduces the amplitude of the waveform and reduces the signal. These earmuffs are designed to protect against a continuous signal, particularly low frequency sounds, such as diesel locomotives, heavy tractors, or airfields.

=== Dual protection with earplugs ===
Most earmuffs can be expected to provide adequate attenuation for noise levels up to 103 dBC. At levels beyond this intensity, it becomes necessary for users to wear earplugs with earmuffs on top in order to achieve adequate protection from hearing damage. The simultaneous use of two forms of hearing protections is known as dual hearing protection. The MSHA regulations stipulate that workers must use dual hearing protection when average 8-hour exposures are 105 dBA or greater. The US Department of Defense recommends use of dual protection when exposed to noise ranging from 108-118 dBA. Dual protection is also recommended when shooting firearms because of the extremely high-level impulses (140Â dB and greater) produced.

The amount of noise reduction from dual hearing protection is NOT a sum of the noise reductions ratings from the two devices. For example, if wearing an earplug with a NRR of 25Â dB and an earmuff with an NRR of 20Â dB, the combined protection would not be 45Â dB. Instead, 5Â dB should be added to the higher of the two NRRs. In the preceding example, the combined earmuff and earplug NRR would be estimated at 30Â dB (25Â dB plus 5).

=== Barriers to effectiveness ===

==== Fit ====

A proper fit of the earmuffs on the head is essential to providing adequate hearing protection. Individuals will require earmuffs of differing sizes. This is especially important to remember when considering earmuffs for children. Muffs should make a good seal against the head and should fully cover the outer ear without pushing against the ears. Additionally, the headband should be the correct length to hold the cushions over the ears. Otherwise, sound can leak under the muffs and will reach the users&#x27; ears. Some wearers may use their earmuffs when hair is covering their ears or while wearing glasses. Prior to placement on the head, hair should be carefully pulled back and away from the cushions. Placing earmuffs over obstructing hair or safety glasses with thick frames may reduce the earmuff attenuation by 5-10Â dB. Even eyeglasses with thinner frames can reduce the effectiveness of hearing protection by 3-7Â dB.

One simple method for checking earmuff fit is to lift one or both muffs away from the head while in a noisy environment. If the noise is considerably louder with the adjustment, then the earmuffs are providing at least some degree of noise reduction.

Improper earmuff fit can cause discomfort, which in turn may cause the individual to avoid wearing the hearing protection device, reducing its effectiveness. Characteristics of a comfortable earmuff include: lightweight material, soft and removable circumaural cushions, low heat and humidity buildup, easy maintenance, reduction in low-frequency noise, no resonances of sound within the earcup, wide headband, and large enough earcups to allow for full coverage of the outer ear. If the individual finds the hearing protection device to be uncomfortable, he or she should explore other options for hearing protection, such as a different style of earmuff or earplugs.

Styles

There are different earmuff style options for HPD users. Styles include: cap-mounts for hard hats, neckbands for use with welding helmets and faceshields, folding earmuffs are meant to be portable and easy to store, and multi-position earmuffs worn in varies positions are useful for versatility to wear both earmuffs and other safety ware, such as glasses or masks.

Structural transmission

It is possible for sound to transmit through the earmuff materials, reducing the device&#x27;s effectiveness. This transmission is primarily seen above 1000Â Hz.

Vibration of the earmuff

Exposure to high level noise (190Â dB SPL) may cause the earmuff to vibrate off the external ear causing a leak which would allow hazardous exposure to dangerous levels of noise. In loud enough environments, the ear canal can vibrate, causing the air trapped inside the earcup to vibrate as well. This typically only occurs with low frequency noise, but can reduce the effectiveness of the hearing protection device. Technology in earmuffs is developing and shows promise in reducing the effects of airflow vibrations in the ear muffs. 

Readjustment

During the amount of time an individual wears earmuffs, the device can be jostled and displaced from the proper position that allows for the highest attenuation. This can be common in the workplace, as many individuals are in motion during the time they are wearing the hearing protection device. Moving the jaw while chewing or talking and perspiration are examples of ways in which readjustment can occur, causing the seal to be broken between the earcup and skin and allowing sound to leak in.

==== Deterioration ====
It is also important to consider the age and physical condition of earmuffs. Earmuffs should be inspected regularly for cracks and changes in shape or firmness. Headbands may also lose their tension or ability to properly adjust to the head, which could lead to a decrease in device effectiveness. Physical changes could create an opening to the ear, allowing sound through and reducing attenuation. According to some manufacturers, ear cushions should be replaced every 6-8 months if used regularly. If earmuffs are used very frequently then the cushion should be replaced every 3-4 months.

Detriments

Wearing earmuffs makes it difficult to communicate because it blocks speech noise which may make speech sound muffled or unintelligible. It also makes it difficult to localize sound.

=== Specific considerations for hearing protection for workers with hearing loss ===

Workers with hearing loss face additional risk factors on the job site such as an inability to hear warning signals or alarms, an increased difficulty to tell where sounds are coming from, and increased difficulty communicating with co-workers. This occurs due to the &quot;hearing protection device (HPD)&quot; attenuating the signals/noises below the level that the worker is able to hear. OSHA regulations require individuals to wear HPD regardless of their amount of hearing loss, even if they have a severe to profound hearing loss. Workers that have sustained a standard threshold shift are required by OSHA to wear HPD at an 85Â dB TWA. There are special considerations to take into account when fitting HPD on workers with a hearing loss. These factors include comfort, degree and configuration of the worker&#x27;s hearing loss, the necessary communication demands in the workplace (verbal vs. nonverbal), the ease of communication, and the noise exposure levels of the worker.

Workers may want to wear their hearing aids under an earmuff. According to OSHA, hearing aids should not be used in areas with dangerous noise levels. However, OSHA allows for the professional(s) in charge of the hearing loss protection program to decide on a case-by-case basis if a worker can wear their hearing aids under an earmuff in high-level noise environments. Workers are not permitted to wear their hearing aids (even if they are turned off) instead of using HPD. OSHA specifies that hearing aids are not &quot;hearing protectors&quot; and do not attenuate enough sound to be used instead of HPD. Wearing hearing aids alone, without the use of earmuffs, could potentially cause additional noise-induced hearing loss. It is recommended that workers should not use their hearing aids without the use of an earmuff when exposed to sound levels over 80 dBA.

Devices that provide both communication enhancement and hearing protection can be used to attenuate loud sounds and amplify soft-level sounds. These are available with both wireless and wired options. The effects of these will vary based on the degree and configuration of the worker&#x27;s hearing loss. Dual hearing protection with electronic/communication elements may aid a person with hearing loss in hearing warning signals and help with communication. Workers with a high frequency hearing loss may benefit more from HPD that attenuates sounds equally across the pitch range. This is helpful because traditional HPD will attenuate the higher frequencies (where these individuals have a hearing loss) more than the mid- and low-frequencies. Whereas, HPD that attenuate equally across the pitch range, can provide more comfort and balancing of loudness across the pitches for these individuals with hearing loss. This type of HPD are commonly referred to as &quot;musicians plugs.&quot; NIOSH provides a &quot;Hearing Protector Device Compendium&quot; with information on the different types of HPD.

<text>The Third Dynasty of Ur or Ur III was a Sumerian dynasty based in the city of Ur in the 22nd and 21st centuries BC (middle chronology). For a short period they were the preeminent power in Mesopotamia and their realm is sometimes referred to by historians as the Neo-Sumerian Empire. 

The Third Dynasty of Ur is commonly abbreviated as &quot;Ur III&quot; by historians studying the period. It is numbered in reference to previous dynasties, such as the First Dynasty of Ur (26-25th century BC), but it seems the once supposed Second Dynasty of Ur was never recorded.

The Third Dynasty of Ur was the last Sumerian dynasty which came to preeminent power in Mesopotamia. It began after several centuries of control, exerted first by the Akkadian Empire, and then, after its fall, by Gutian and independent Sumerian city-state kings. It controlled the cities of Isin, Larsa, and Eshnunna and extended as far north as Upper Mesopotamia. The Ur III provinces, from north to south were Sippar, Tiwe, Urum, PuÃ¶, Gudua, Babylon, Kis, Kazallu, Apiak, Marad, Nippur, Uru-sagrig, Isin, Adab, Suruppak, Umma, Girsu, Uruk, and Ur.
==History==
The Third Dynasty of Ur arose some time after the fall of the Akkad Dynasty. The period between the last powerful king of the Akkad Dynasty, Shar-Kali-Sharri, and the first king of Ur III, Ur-Nammu, is not well documented, but most Assyriologists posit that there was a brief &quot;Dark Age&quot;, followed by a power struggle among the most powerful city-states. On the king-lists, Shar-Kali-Sharri is followed by two more kings of Akkad and six in Uruk; however, there are no year names surviving for any of these, nor even any artifacts confirming that any of these reigns was historical â save one artifact for Dudu of Akkad (Shar-Kali-Sharri&#x27;s immediate successor on the list). Akkad&#x27;s primacy, instead, seems to have been usurped by Gutian invaders from the Zagros Mountains, whose kings ruled in Mesopotamia for an indeterminate period (124 years according to some copies of the king list, only 25 according to others). An illiterate and nomadic people, their rule was not conducive to agriculture, nor record-keeping, and by the time they were expelled, the region was crippled by severe famine and skyrocketing grain prices. Their last king, Tirigan, was driven out by Utu-hengal of Uruk.

Following Utu-Hengal&#x27;s reign, Ur-Nammu (originally a general) founded the Third Dynasty of Ur, but the precise events surrounding his rise are unclear. The &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; states that Utu-hengal had reigned for seven years (or 426, or 26 in other copies), although only one year-name for him is known from records, that of his accession, suggesting a shorter reign.

It is possible that Ur-Nammu was originally his governor. There are two stelae discovered in Ur that include this detail in an inscription about Ur-Nammu&#x27;s life.

Ur-Nammu rose to prominence as a warrior-king when he crushed the ruler of Lagash in battle, killing the king himself. After this battle, Ur-Nammu seems to have earned the title &#x27;king of Sumer and Akkad.&#x27;

Ur&#x27;s dominance over the Neo-Sumerian Empire was consolidated with the famous Code of Ur-Nammu, probably the first such law-code for Mesopotamia since that of Urukagina of Lagash centuries earlier.

Many significant changes occurred in the empire under Shulgi&#x27;s reign. He took steps to centralize and standardize the procedures of the empire. He is credited with standardizing administrative processes, archival documentation, the tax system, and the national calendar. He captured the city of Susa and the surrounding region, toppling Elamite king Kutik-Inshushinak, while the rest of Elam fell under control of Shimashki dynasty.

===The military and conquests of Ur III===
In the last century of the 3rd millennium BCE, it is believed that the kings of Ur waged several conflicts around the frontiers of the kingdom. These conflicts are believed to have been influenced by the king of Akkad. As there is little evidence of how the kings organized their forces, it is unclear whether defensive forces were in the center or outside the kingdom. What is known is that the second ruler of the dynasty, Å ulgi achieved some expansion and conquest. These were continued by his three successors but their conquests are less frequent with time.

At the very height of the expansion of Ur, they had taken territory from southeastern Anatolia (modern Turkey) to the Iranian shore of the Persian Gulf, a testimony to the strength of the dynasty. There are hundreds of texts that explain how treasures were seized by the Ur III armies and brought back to the kingdom after many victories. In some texts, it also appears that the Shulgi campaigns were the most profitable for the kingdom, although it is likely that the kings and temples of Ur were primarily those that benefited from the spoils of war.
====Conflicts with northeastern mountain tribes====
The rulers of Ur III were often in conflict with the highland tribes of the Zagros mountain area who dwelled in the northeastern portion of Mesopotamia. The most important of these tribes were the Simurrum and the Lullubi tribal kingdoms. They were also often in conflict with Elam.
====Military rulers of Mari====
In the northern area of Mari, Semitic military rulers called the Shakkanakkus apparently continued to rule contemporaneously with the Third Dynasty of Ur, or possibly in the period that just preceded it, with rulers such as military governors like Puzur-Ishtar, who was probably contemporary with Amar-Sin.
===List of rulers===
Assyriologists employ many complicated methods for establishing the most precise dates possible for this period, but controversy still exists. Generally, scholars use either the conventional (middle, generally preferred) or the low (short) chronologies. They are as follows:

The list of the Kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur with the length of their reigns, appears on a cuneiform document listing the kings of Ur and Isin, the &quot;List of Reigns of Kings of Ur and Isin&quot; (MS 1686). The list explains: &quot;18 years Ur-Namma [was] king, 48 years Shulgi [was] king, 9 years Amar-Suen, 9 years Su-Suen, 24 years Ibbi-Suen.&quot;

===Fall of Ur III===

The power of the Neo-Sumerians was waning. Ibbi-Sin in the 21st century launched military campaigns into Elam, but did not manage to penetrate far into the country. In 2004/1940 BC (middle/short chronology respectively), the Elamites, allied with the people of Susa and led by Kindattu, king of the Elamite Shimashki dynasty, was able to surround Ur and managed to sack Ur(early summer?) and lead Ibbi-Sin into captivity, ending the third dynasty of Ur. After this victory, the Elamites destroyed the kingdom, and ruled through military occupation for the next 21 years.

Mesopotamia then fell under Amorite influence. The Amorite kings of the Dynasty of Isin formed successor states to Ur III, starting the Isin-Larsa period. They managed to drive the Elamites out of Ur, rebuilt the city, and returned the statue of Nanna that the Elamites had plundered. The Amorites were nomadic tribes from the northern Levant who were Northwest Semitic speakers, unlike the native Akkadians of southern Mesopotamia and Assyria, who spoke East Semitic. By around the 19th century BC, much of southern Mesopotamia was occupied by the Amorites. The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna, Lagash, and later, founding Babylon as a state.

== Dating systems ==

When Kings of the Third Ur dynasty ruled they had specific dates and names for each period of their rule. One example was &quot;the year of Ur-nammu king,&quot; which marked Ur-Nammu&#x27;s coronation. Another important time was the year named &quot;The threshed grain of Largas.&quot; This year name references an event in which Ur-Nammu attacked the territory of Largas and took grain back to Ur. Another year-name that has been discovered was the year that Ur-Nammu&#x27;s daughter became &quot;en&quot; of the god Nanna and was renamed with the priestess-name of En-Nirgal-ana. This designation as &quot;en&quot; of Nanna makes the year&#x27;s designation almost certain.

==Social and political organization==
===Political organization===

The Ur III state followed a patrimonial system. The state was organized into a hierarchical pyramid of households with the royal household at the top. As described by Steinkeller it was a network of households linked together by mutual rights and obligations. All resources of the state were exclusively owned by the royal household. All inferior households were considered dependants of the higher ones. Inferior households contributed corvee labour to the royal household and received economic support, land, and protection in return.

In each province, administrative and economic responsibility were split between two households: one headed by a governor (ensi) and one headed by a general (Å agina) who represented the crown.

Each province had a redistribution center where provincial taxes, called bala, would all go to be shipped to the capital. The bala tax worked on a rotating basis, with only one province supporting the kingdom at a time. Each province would support the kingdom for an amount of time determined by the size of their economy. Taxes could be paid in various forms, from crops to livestock to land. The government would then apportion out goods as needed, including funding temples and giving food rations to the needy.

=== The city of Nippur and its importance ===
The city of Nippur was one of the most important cities in the Third Dynasty of Ur. Nippur is believed to be the religious center of Mesopotamia. It was home to the shrine of Enlil, who was the lord of all gods. This was where the God Enlil spoke the king&#x27;s name and was calling the king to his existence. This was used as a legitimacy for every king in order to secure power. The city is also believed to be a place where people would often take disputes according to some tablets that were found near the city. Politically it is hard to say how significant Nippur was because the city had no status as a dynastic or military power. However, the fact that Nippur never really gave kings any real political or military advantages suggests to some that it was never really conquered. The city itself was more viewed as &quot;national Cult Center.&quot; Because it was viewed this way it was thought that any conquest of the city would give the Mesopotamian rulers unacceptable political risks. Also as the city was seen as a holy site this enabled Nippur to survive numerous conflicts that wiped out many other cities in the region.

===Social system===

This is an area where scholars have many different views. It had long been posited that the common laborer was nothing more than a serf, but new analysis and documents reveal a possible different picture. Gangs of labourers can be divided into various groups.

Certain groups indeed seem to work under compulsion. Others work in order to keep property or get rations from the state. Still other laborers were free men and women for whom social mobility was a possibility. Many families travelled together in search of labor. Such laborers could amass private property and even be promoted to higher positions. This is quite a different picture of a laborer&#x27;s life than the previous belief that they were afforded no way to move out of the social group they were born into.

Slaves also made up a crucial group of labor for the state. One scholar estimates that 2/5 of chattel slaves mentioned in documents were not born slaves but became slaves due to accumulating debt, being sold by family members, or other reasons. However, one surprising feature of this period is that slaves seem to have been able to accumulate some assets and even property during their lifetimes such that they could buy their freedom. Extant documents give details about specific deals for slaves&#x27; freedoms negotiated with slaveowners.

===An early code of law===

One salient feature of Ur III is its establishment of one of the earliest known law-codes, the &quot;Code of Ur-Nammu&quot;. It is quite similar to the famous Code of Hammurabi, resembling its prologue and bodily structure. Extant copies, written in Old Babylonian, exist from Nippur, Sippar, and also Ur itself. Although the prologue credits Ur-Nammu, the author is still somewhat under dispute; some scholars attribute it to his son, Shulgi.

The prologue to the law-code, written in the first person, established the king as the beacon of justice for his land, a role that previous kings normally did not play. He claims to want justice for all, including traditionally unfortunate groups in the kingdom like the widower or the orphan.

Most legal disputes were dealt with locally by government officials called mayors, although their decision could be appealed and eventually overturned by the provincial governor. Sometimes legal disputes were publicly aired with witnesses present at a place like the town square or in front of the temple. However, the image of the king as the supreme judge of the land took hold, and this image appears in many literary works and poems. Citizens sometimes wrote letters of prayer to the king, either present or past.

==Industry and commerce==

The Ur III kings oversaw many substantial state-run projects, including intricate irrigation systems and centralization of agriculture. An enormous labor force was amassed to work in agriculture, particularly in irrigation, harvesting, and sowing.

Textiles were a particularly important industry in Ur during this time. The textile industry was run by the state. Many men, women, and children alike were employed to produce wool and linen clothing. The detailed documents from the administration of this period exhibit a startling amount of centralization; some scholars have gone so far as to say no other period in Mesopotamian history reached the same level.

=== Trade with the Gulf Region ===
Trade was very important to the Ur Dynasty because it was a way to ensure that the empire had enough ways to grow its wealth and care for those Ur ruled. One of the areas that Mesopotamia traded with was the Persian Gulf area, trading mostly raw materials such as metal, wood, ivory, and also semi-precious stones. One specific kind of item traded with the two regions were conch shells. These were made by craftsmen who would turn them into lamps and cups dating back to the 3rd millennium. They have been discovered in graves, palaces, temples, and even residential homes. The fact that this item was mostly found in upper class contexts could show that only the wealthy at the time had access to the item. Additionally, Ur consumed jewelry, inlays, carvings, and cylinder seals in significant amounts. The high demand for these items shows a heavy trade relationship with the Gulf region.

===Commercial relations with the Indus===
Evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur can be found from around 2350 BC. Various objects made with shell species that are characteristic of the Indus coast, particularly &quot;Trubinella Pyrum&quot; and &quot;Fasciolaria Trapezium&quot;, have been found in the archaeological sites of Mesopotamia dating from around 2500-2000 BC. Several Indus seals with Harappan script have also been found in Mesopotamia, particularly in Ur and Babylon. About twenty seals have been found from the Akkadian and Ur III sites, that have connections with Harappa and often use the Indus script.

These exchanges came to a halt with the decline of the Indus valley civilization after around 1900 BC.

== Art and culture ==
Sumerian dominated the cultural sphere and was the language of legal, administrative, and economic documents, while signs of the spread of Akkadian could be seen elsewhere. New towns that arose in this period were virtually all given Akkadian names. Culture also thrived through many different types of art forms.

===Literature===
Sumerian texts were mass-produced in the Ur III period; however, the word &#x27;revival&#x27; or &#x27;renaissance&#x27; to describe this period is misleading because archaeological evidence does not offer evidence of a previous period of decline. Instead, Sumerian began to take on a different form. As the Semitic Akkadian language became the common spoken language, Sumerian continued to dominate literature and also administrative documents. Government officials learned to write at special schools that used only Sumerian literature.

Some scholars believe that the Uruk &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; was written down during this period into its classic Sumerian form. The Ur III Dynasty attempted to establish ties to the early kings of Uruk by claiming to be their familial relations.

For example, the Ur III kings often claimed Gilgamesh&#x27;s divine parents, Ninsun and Lugalbanda, as their own, probably to evoke a comparison to the epic hero.

Another text from this period, known as &quot;The Death of Urnammu&quot;, contains an underworld scene in which Ur-Nammu showers &quot;his brother Gilgamesh&quot; with gifts.

<doc id="1153644" wikidata="Q1185005" url="?curid=1153644" title="Deluc (crater)">
<text>Deluc is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern highlands of the Moon. It is located to the south-southeast of the crater Maginus, and the huge Clavius. Due east of Deluc is the somewhat larger crater Lilius. It is 47 kilometers in diameter and 3.3 kilometers deep. It is from the Pre-Imbrian period, which lasted from 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

This is a relatively worn formation with the satellite crater Deluc H intruding into the northeast rim. A triangular bulge of material covers the floor from the rim of this intruding crater to near the midpoint of the interior. The small craterlet Deluc T is attached to the southern outer rim of Deluc, and joins it to the small Deluc D to the south.

The remaining rim of Deluc is not quite circular, having a slight outward bulge to the northwest. The interior is worn and smoothed from a history of tiny impacts, although the edge is still well-defined. There is a tiny craterlet in the northeast part of the interior, but most of the remainder of the floor is level and marked only by tiny impacts.

The crater is named for Jean-AndrÃ© Deluc, an 18th-century Swiss geologist and physicist.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Deluc.

<doc id="1153653" wikidata="Q7114446" url="?curid=1153653" title="Owen Davies (historian)">
<text>Owen Davies (born 1969) is a British historian who specialises in the history of magic, witchcraft, ghosts, and popular medicine. He is currently Professor in History at the University of Hertfordshire and has been described as Britain&#x27;s &quot;foremost academic expert on the history of magic&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Davies&#x27;s interest in the history of witchcraft and magic developed out of a childhood interest in folklore and mythology, which was spawned in part from reading the books of Alan Garner. From around the age of sixteen, he also became interested in archaeology and began to get involved with field-walking and earthwork surveying. He then went on to study archaeology and history at Cardiff University and spent many weeks over the next six years helping excavate Bronze Age and Neolithic sites in France and England, mostly in the area around Avebury. He developed a strong interest in archaeology in general, and the ritual monuments and practices of the Neolithic and Bronze Age.

From Cardiff, he went on to write a doctorate at Lancaster University. Completed in 1995, Davies&#x27;s thesis looked at the continuation and decline of popular belief in witchcraft and magic from the Witchcraft Act 1735 to the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 (1991â1994).

== Career ==
Davies has authored and edited 15 books and numerous research articles.

He has been a key collaborator in a number of large-scale historical research projects. From 2010 to 2015, Davies was Co-Investigator on &#x27;Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse&#x27;, a Wellcome Trust funded project exploring &quot;the meanings, treatment, and uses of the criminal corpse&quot;. Davies was also a Co-Investigator on the major Leverhulme-funded project &#x27;Inner Lives: Emotions, Identity, and the Supernatural, 1300-1900&#x27;. Davies and University of Hertfordshire colleague Dr Ceri Houlbrook are currently Co-Investigators in &#x27;Bottles Concealed and Revealed&#x27;, an Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded project investigating witch bottles.

Davies has been based at the University of Hertfordshire since the early 2000s. In 2019, he instigated a Folklore Studies MA at the University of Hertfordshire, which is currently the only academic qualification of its kind in England and Wales.

In 2020, Davies was elected President of the Folklore Society.

<doc id="1153656" wikidata="Q4389321" url="?curid=1153656" title="Missile tank">
<text>A missile tank is an armoured fighting vehicle fulfilling the role of a main battle tank, but using only guided missiles for main armament. Several nations have experimented with prototypes, notably the Soviet Union during the tenure of Nikita Khrushchev (projects Object 167, Object 137Ml, Object 155Ml, Object 287, Object 775), 

The West German Jaguar 2 tank destroyer saw service as a standard vehicle, although the Soviet IT-1 missile-armed tank destroyer also saw limited service.

The term is sometimes applied more loosely to conventional tanks which are able to launch anti-tank guided missiles, to supplement their main gun for very long-range fire. Examples are the U.S.-German prototype MBT-70, the American M60A2, the defunct U.S. M551 Sheridan and French AMX-13, and several Soviet, Russian, and Ukrainian tanks: T-64, T-72, T-80, T-84, T-90 and T-14.

In the 1930s, the Soviet Union tested the RBT-5 rocket-based assault gun, comprising a BT tank mounting two 250-kg &quot;TT Tank Torpedo&quot; unguided rockets its turret sides.

<doc id="1153667" wikidata="Q1064034" url="?curid=1153667" title="Gutian rule in Mesopotamia">
<text>The Gutian dynasty (Sumerian: , gu-ti-umKI) was a line of kings, originating among the Gutian people. Originally thought to be a horde that swept in and brought down Akkadian and Sumerian rule in Mesopotamia, the Gutians are now known to have been in the area for at least a century by then. By the end of the Akkadian period, the Sumerian city of Adab was occupied by the Gutians, who made it their capital. The Gutian Dynasty came to power in Mesopotamia near the end of the 3rd millennium BC, after the decline and fall of the Akkadian Empire. How long Gutian kings held rulership over Mesopotamia is uncertain, with estimates ranging from a few years up to a century. The end of the Gutian dynasty is marked by the accession of Uruk ruler Utu-hengal ( 2055â2048 BC), marking the short-lived &quot;Fifth dynasty of Uruk&quot;, followed by Ur ruler Ur-Nammu ( 2047â2030 BC), founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur.

There are very few hard facts available regarding the rulers of the Gutian Dynasty, still fewer about the Gutian people; even their homeland is not known. We have a few royal inscriptions from one ruler, Erridu-pizir, an inscribed macehead from another, La-erabum, a handful of passing mentions from contemporary Mesopotamian rulers, and one long inscription by Uruk ruler Utu-hengal. And there are the many versions of the Sumerian King List, most recensions of which were written long after the time of the Gutian Dynasty and give different, sometimes conflicting versions of history. The earliest version of the Sumerian King List, written in the Ur III period, not long afterward in time, does not mention the Gutians and lists a Gutian ruler, Tirigan, as a king of Adab. Yet the SKL remains our only source for most Gutian kings.

Still, clearly the Gutian rulers had a huge impact on lateâ3rd-millennium Mesopotamia, reflected in the vast array of literary compositions featuring them, continuing for almost two millennia.

==History==

At one time it was believed that Gutium was known from the 24th century BC, well before the time
of the Gutian Dynasty. This was based on a tablet purportedly from the Early Dynastic ruler of Adab Lugal-Anne-Mundu. The inscription included Gutium in the area paying tribute to the ruler. This inscription is now understood to be an Old Babylonian period literary composition written many centuries after the time of Lugal-Anne-Mundu. The first attestation of Gutium came from early in the Sargonic period when the Gutians are mentioned in year names of Akkadian rulers and established a capital at the prominent Early Dynastic Sumerian city of Adab.

The full history of the Gutian dynasty is not known. It is known that it lies roughly between two major empires of the late 3rd millennium BC, the Akkadian Empire and the later Ur III Empire. Towards the end of the reign of the last notable Akkadian ruler, Shar-Kali-Sharri ( 2153â2129 BC), the Akkadian Empire went on to a period of disarray under several weak rulers beginning a tumultuous time in Mesopotamia as Early Dynastic city-states such as Lagash and Uruk began to re-assert themselves. The Gutian newcomers in Adab also asserted their claim to rulership. This contentious time ended with the rise of Ur III under Ur-Nammu ( 2048â2030 BC).
The end point of the Gutian dynasty is felt to be certain based on a long inscription of Utu-hengal ( 2055Â â 2048 BC) who was ruler of Uruk (and thought to be the brother of the first Ur II ruler Ur-Nammu) which described the destruction of the Gutians under their king Tirigan. For what happened up to then our only sources are the many conflicting recensions of the Sumerian King List (SKL) and the various literary compositions that were produced in the following centuries and millennia. Neither are historically reliable sources but can be mined for insights into the events of the Gutian period. 

==Contemporary sources==
===Shar-kali-sharri Year Names===
In the period before the Gutian Dynasty gained rulership over Mesopotamia the Akkadian Empire controlled the region. Two year names of Akkadian ruler Shar-kali-sharri (the last before the empire began to unravel) reflect of interaction with Gutium.
*&quot;In the year in which Szarkaliszarri laid the foundations of the temples of the goddess Annunitum and of the god Aba in Babylon and when he defeated Szarlak, king of Gutium&quot;
*&quot;Year in which the yoke was imposed on Gutium&quot;.

===Ur-Nammu Year Name===
One year name of Ur ruler Ur-Nammu mentions Gutium. It is uncertain if the year name was from the time when he was only governor at Ur, leaving the possibility it was a reflected year name of Utu-hengal, or was later after he had assumed rulership over Mesopotamia.
*&quot;Year Gutium was destroyed&quot;

===Tablet of Lugalannatum===
The tablet marks the building of a temple, E-gidru, in Umma. In passing it mentions the name of a Gutian ruler.
*&quot;Lugal-ana-tuma, governor of Umma â 35 years having past since (the territory of) Umma was divided up â built the E-gidru at Umma, drove into the earth its foundation pegs, (and) saw after everything that was necessary therein. At that time, Si&#x27;um was king of Gutium.&quot;

===Cylindrical Tablet of Nammahni===
The Umma ruler Nammahni, marking the construction of a temple to the goddess Ninura, mentioned in passing the name of a Gutian ruler.
*&quot;For the goddess Ninura, mother of Umma, Namahni, governor of Umma, built her E-ula temple (and) restored it. At that time Iarlagan was king of Gutium.&quot;

===Tablet of IÅ¡arum===
A tablet from Umma, dating to the waning days of the Akkadian empire, mentions a Gutian governor.

*&quot;Thus says IÅ¡arum to Me-sag âAs to the fact that Lugal-ÄiÅ¡ and? Ka-Utu ... How can my loyal servant, who has held my feet, become hostile? (By) IÅ¡tar and Ilaba I swear that he shall approach me. I will not set the weapon of blood against him. Henceforth, I shall appoint him anew as the Gutian ensi. ...&quot;

===Tablet of Utu-hengal===

An inscription of the Uruk ruler Utu-hengal, known from 3 Old Babylonian copies, commemorated the defeat of Gutian (and its king Tirigan) and the return of rulership to Sumer. Note the Mesopotamian names of Tirigan&#x27;s generals.
*&quot;The god Enlil â (as for) Gu[tium], the fanged serpent of the mountain, who acted with violence against the gods, who carried off the kingship of the land of Sumer to the mountain land, who fi[ll]ed the land of Sumer with wickedness, who took away the wife from the one who had a wife, who took away the child from the one who had a child, who put wickedness and evil in the land (of Sumer) â the god Enlil, lord of the foreign lands, commissioned Utu-hegal, the mighty man, king of Uruk, king of the four quarters, the king whose utterance cannot be countermanded, to destroy their name. (Thereupon) he (Utu-hegal) went to the goddess Inanna, his lady (and) prayed to her,(saying) &#x27;My lady, lioness of battle, who butts the foreign lands, the god Enlil has com[missioned me]to bring back the kingship of the land of Sumer. [May you be my] a[lly] The enemy hordes had trampled(everything). Tiri[gan], the king of Gutium, had ..., (but) no one set out against him. He had seized both banks of the Tigris River. In the south, in Sumer, he had blocked (water from) the fields. In the north, he had closed off the roads (and) caused tall grass to grow up along the highway(s) of the land. (But), the king granted power by the god Enlil, the one chosen in the heart of the goddess Inanna â Utu-hegal â the mighty man, went forth from Uruk (and) set up ... in the temple of the god IÅ¡kur. He called out to the citizens of his city,(saying): &#x27;The god Enlil has given Gutium to me. My lady, the goddess Inanna, is my ally. The god Dumuzi-ama-uÅ¡umgal-ana has declared &#x27;It is a matter for me&#x27;. The god GilgameÅ¡, son of the goddess Ninsun, has assigned him (Dumuzi) to me as bailiff. He made the citizens of Uruk (and) Kullab happy. His city followed him as if they were (just) one person. He (Utu-hegal) arranged in correct array his select elite troops. After he (Utu-hegal) departed (from) the temple of the god IÅ¡kur, on the fourth day he set up... in the city of Nagsu on the Iturungal canal. On the fifth day he set up ... in the shrine Ili-tappe. He captured Ur-Ninazu (and) Nabi-Enlil, generals whom he (Tirigan) had sent as envoys to the land of Sumer, (and) put handcuffs on them. After he departed (from) the shrine Ili-tappe, on the sixth day he set up ... at Karkar. He proceeded to the god Iskur (and) prayed to him, (saying) &#x27;O god IÅ¡kur! The god Enlil has given me (his) weapon. May you be my ally&#x27;. In the middle of that night he [got up], and at day break [proceeded] (to a point) upstream from Adab. He [prayed] to him (Utu), (saying) &#x27;O god Utu! The god Enlil has given Gutium to me. May you be my ally&#x27; In that place, against the Gutians, he laid a trap (and) led (his) troops against them. Utu-hegal, the mighty man, defeated their generals. Then Tirigan, king of Gutium, fled alone on foot. In the place where he (tried) to save his life â Dabrum â he (at first) was safe. (But) since the citizens of Dabrum realized that Utu-hegal was the king to whom the god Enlil had granted power, they did not let Tirigan go. The envoys of Utu-hegal captured Tirigan along with his wife (and) children at Dabrum. They put handcuffs and a blindfold on him. Utu-hegal made him lie at the feet of the god U[tu] and placed his foot on his neck. Gutium, the fanged serpent of the mountain â ... drank water (from[?]) the watercourses... (Utu-hegal) removed ... He brought back the kingship of the land of Sumer.&quot;

==In later literature==
===Great Revolt against Naram-Sin===
This source lives on the borderline between history and literary composition. Some elements of it are from Old Babylonian copies of Naram-Sin royal inscriptions. That core was transformed into a wide variety of literary efforts with names like &quot;Naram-Sin and the Enemy Hordes&quot;. A relevant one is &quot;Gula-AN and the Seventeen Kings against Naram-Sin&quot;. The narrative is that Gutian king Gula-AN, leading 17 other kings, attacks Akkad and is defeated, captured, and then paroled by Naram-Sin, only to attack again resulting in a huge battle the results of which are unknown.
*&quot;... Gula-AN, king of Gut(i)um, [. . .], whom I [defeated] in my strong battle [. . .], and whom I had released to return to his land (but) PN [he joined], he who is not Ìflesh nor blood, verily he is [. . .]. In the Amanus the cedar mountain his oracles [he consulted]. Before the great divides of the [silver(?)] mountains, its gate he captured and stealthily in the night he attacked and my a[rmed forces] he did kill, he did decimate and he did [trample down]. [He made] a confusing mass of their corpses. The depressions and the wadis were [filled] with their blood. Until the sunrise, for six double hours he [made a forced march]. They did not let (me?) rest [. . .]. He pursued me, he [attacked] me frontally fu[riously]. 90,000 of my troops, who were under the command of [PN], he did kill, he did decimate and he did tra[mple down]. In my 360,000 troops I [had confidence]. Son of a nobody [. . .], He encircled me. For the sake(?) of life of Sargon [my fore(father)] ...&quot; (BM 79987)

===Geographical Treatise on Sargon of Akkad&#x27;s Empire===
Another source of uncertain historicity or dating. It is known from a single tablet, findspot thought to be Qalat Sherqat, which was translated in 1925, in the early days of cuneiform studies. Gutium is listed among the area in Sargon&#x27;s domain.
*&quot;... From Sinu (?) to [ ] the land of Armani. From [ ]izzat to Abul-Adad, the land of Gutium. From Abul-Adad to Hallab, the land of Akkad. ... From Hisat to Sippar, the land of Akkad. From Tirqan of Gutium to Uzarilulu, the land of Edamarus. From Uzarilulu to Bit-Sin, the land of Mari. ...&quot;(KAV 092)

===Weidner Chronicle===
The Weidner Chronicle is a literary composition, known from 7 mostly fragmentary Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian (1st Millennium BC) recensions purportedly a copy of a damaged Old Babylonian Period (1894 - 1595 BC) original which described events of centuries earlier. In the case of the Gutians the premise is that the Gutians destroyed the Akkadian Empire because Naram-Sin was mean to the city of Babylon. There are scholars who state that the description of the Gutian rule over parts of Mesopotamia was fiction or that it at least gave undue importance to the Guti horde. This is believed to be perpetuated by the chroniclers of Uruk to turn Utu-hegal&#x27;s minor victory into an event of universal significance for the purpose of solidifying support for his emergent regime. This view is based on the varying accounts of the surviving manuscripts, with many of them in total disagreement as to the length of the king&#x27;s reign and even the identities of the Guti kings. The Weidner Chronicle accounts for the Gutian period as follows:

*&quot;Naram-Sin defiled the people of Babylon. Twice he called up the horde of Gutium against it. ... his people as with a goad ... he gave his sovereignty to the horde of Gutium. Gutium was an oppressive people. They did not know divine worship; rites and regulations they did not know how to perform properly. [Utuhegal] the &quot;fisherman&quot; caught fish as offering-presents on the edge of the seacoast. Until that fish was offered to the [Lord Prince] Marduk, it was not offered to any other god. The Gutians took the cooked fish away from him before it was offered. By his exalted command he took away sovereignty from the horde and gave it to Utuhegal&quot;

===Cuthean Legend of Naram-Sin===
In this text, the Gutians are &quot;scattered&quot; by an unknown horde, the Umman Manda on their way to attacking Naram-Sin with the Gutians then picking up the pieces afterward. An excerpt reads
*&quot;... They scattered the (army of the upper) seas, and reached Gutium. ... They scattered (the army of) Gutium and reached Elam. ...&quot;

===Tablet of Islikun-Dagan===
A tablet, thought to be from Uruk and from the period following the fall of the Akkadian Empire Islikun-Dagan, known from another tablet read:

*&quot;Islikun-Dagan to ... Cultivate the land and preserve the cattle. Up to now the Gutian did not cultivate the land. Don&#x27;t say &#x27;How so ?&#x27; You are strong, so settle Akkad (?), and do you cultivate the land. Let the store-places and the ponds be sought (?) out for you for an approach, and have the cattle brought into the city. With regard to (?) the cattle the Gutians have reared (?), now as for myself I shall say nothing, I shall pay you the money. I swear by the life of Sharkalisharri that if you will indeed deliver the cattle the Gutians reared (?) of your own free will, I will transport (? lit. carry), and that I will pay you the money when (the cattle) come to me.

===Lugal-Ane-mundu inscription===
Originally thought to be an authentic inscription of the 24th century BC ruler it is now known to be a pseudoautobiographical literary composition. It is known from 3 Old Babylonian tablet copies. The fragmentary text lists areas that are tributary to Lugal-Ane-mundu.
*&quot;... The ... of broad Gutium ... seized the ... in Zulum, ... The chief ministers of the Cedar Mountain, Elam, Mará¸«aÅ¡i, Gutium, Subartu, Amurru, Sutium and ... The ... of the Cedar Mountain, Elam, Mará¸«aÅ¡i, Gutium, ... Subartu, Amurru, Sutium, and the Mountain(?) of Eanna&quot;

===Curse of Akkad===
More commonly called the Curse of Agade (known by Sumerians as &quot;The Frown of Enlil&quot;), this is a Sumerian literary composition, many sources and versions of which have been found, purporting to describe the fall of the Akkadian Empire because it had been cursed by the gods. On the Gutians it says:

*&quot;Enlil brought out of the mountains those who do not resemble other people, who are not reckoned as part of the Land, the Gutians, an unbridled people, with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys&#x27; features. Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks. Because of Enlil, they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals. Nothing escaped their clutches, no one left their grasp. Messengers no longer traveled the highways, the courier&#x27;s boat no longer passed along the rivers. The Gutians drove the trusty (?) goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them, they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them. Prisoners manned the watch. Brigands occupied the highways. The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud, and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities. They established gardens for themselves within the cities, and not as usual on the wide plain outside. As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded, the large arable tracts yielded no grain, the inundated tracts yielded no fish, the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, the thick clouds (?) did not rain, the macgurum plant did not grow.&quot;

==Religion==
We know little about what deities the Gutian rulers worshiped though we do know that they did follow gods (both their own, and those of Mesopotamia based on inscriptions of their first known ruler, Erridu-pizir such as this one:

*&quot;[Upon his enemy] he inflicted punishment. Their survivors delivered (lit. âtook hereâ) their offerings â their donkeys, their horses, their large and small cattle. They embraced the feet of the god of Gutium and Erridu-pizir, (saying): âLet our lord ... (rest broken)&quot;

and

*&quot;[The god ... is his (personal) god], [the goddess Esta]r-[Annuni]tum (is) his ..., (and) the god Ilaba, the mighty one of the gods, is his clan (god). Erridu-pizir, the mighty, king of Gutium and of the four quarters: ... and dedicated a statue of myself to the god Enlil in Nippur. As for the one who removes this inscription, may the gods Samas, Astar, [and] Ila[ba] tear out his foundations and destroy his [p]rogeny.&quot;

And on the mace head of a later Gutian ruler La-erabum
*&quot;Lasirab, the mig[hty, ki]ng of [G]utium, Lacuna ... fash[ioned] and dedicated (this mace) .As for the one who removes this inscription and writes his own name (instead), may the god of Gutium, Astar, and Sin tear out his foundations and destroy his progeny.&quot;

One possible god of Gutium has been proposed, Abublab, identified with Ninurta.

==List of rulers==
Aside from a few inscriptions, mostly from a single ruler, Erridupizir, most of what is known about the names and reigns of Gutian rulers comes from the &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot;. There are about two dozen sources, most fragments, for the &quot;SKL&quot; which often conflict. The earliest source is from the Ur III period, well after some of the events described. Unlike the literary narratives, which have the Akkadian Empire falling to the Gutian hordes, the &quot;SKL&quot; has rulership passing from Akkad to Uruk, which then falls to the Gutians. It is also unknown if the dynasties listed in the &quot;SKL&quot; are all sequential or if there is overlap in rulership. Note that the order and dates vary in different recensions of the &quot;SKL&quot;. The listed reign lengths throughout much of the Gutian period are comparatively short and uniform. The following list should not be considered complete:

<doc id="1153683" wikidata="Q6441983" url="?curid=1153683" title="Kugler (crater)">
<text>Kugler is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It is located just past the southeast limb of the Moon&#x27;s surface, in the proximity of the libration zone that is occasionally brought into sight. The crater lies in the midpoint between the craters Anuchin to the north-northwest and Priestley to the south-southeast.

In the past the floor of this crater has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving a dark (low albedo) surface that is level and nearly featureless except for a wrinkle ridge that crosses the crater. The surviving rim is low and heavily worn, with a number of old crater indentations along the edge. Attached to the western rim is the smaller Kugler U, an old, worn formation. To the south is the double-crater formation Kugler N, which has also been flooded by lava.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kugler.

<text>SATS Ltd. (SATS) is a Singapore-headquartered aviation solutions company that is one of the world&#x27;s largest providers of air cargo handling services and Asia&#x27;s leading airline caterer.
Following the acquisition of Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) in 2023, the combined SATS and WFS network operates over 215 stations in 27 countries, with operations in the Asia-Pacific, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. These cover trade routes responsible for more than 50% of global air cargo volume.

SATS provides gateway services that span air cargo handling, baggage and ramp handling, passenger services, aviation security, to cruise handling and cruise terminal management. SATS food services comprises airline catering, food distribution and logistics, institutional catering and linen and laundry services.

In Singapore, SATS provides the main air cargo, ground handling and in-flight catering services at its country&#x27;s Changi Airport.

While the company name is not an acronym, the letters recall the company&#x27;s heritage with Singapore Airport Terminal Services, which was then a unit of national flag carrier, Singapore Airlines.

SATS subsidiaries includes SATS Airport Services, SATS Catering, SATS Security Services, Aero Laundry &amp; Linen Services, Aerolog Express, Country Foods Pte Ltd. and Singapore Food Industries.

SATS has been listed on the Singapore Exchange since May 2000.

==History==

===Origin===
The history of SATS can be traced back to the very beginning of commercial aviation in Singapore. In the early years, ground-handling services were provided by a department of Malayan Airways, which became Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA) in 1967. Five years later, MSA ceased operations and paved the way for two new entitiesÂ â Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Malaysian Airline System (MAS).
As SIA concentrated on its core business of running an airline, the establishment of SATS as a separate, yet wholly owned subsidiary company evolved naturally. On 15 December 1972, SATS was formally corporatised with 1,673 staff. By the end of the first year, staff numbers rose to 2,000 while gross revenue increased by 25 per cent.

===Early history===
In 1977, SATS opened an airfreight terminal at Paya Lebar Airport capable of handling 160,000 tonnes of cargo a year.

In 1980, SATS made the move to Singapore&#x27;s new Changi Airport after investing S$147 million in a new headquarters building, a new inflight catering centre, which at that time was the largest single-building inflight kitchen in the world, and two new airfreight terminals.

By the mid-1980s, SATS was able to handle about 20,000 passengers a day at Changi Airport, a 60 per cent increase over the 12,700 passengers handled daily at Paya Lebar Airport in 1980. Cargo also registered double-digit growth rates.

In 1985, SATS was restructured into four companies so that it could better manage demand for its services. Singapore Airport Terminal Services became the parent company and subsidiaries were formed out of the four operating divisions: Apron Services, Cargo Services, Passenger Services and Catering.

In 1989, SATS added two new airfreight terminals and invested in new passenger handling equipment for Changi Airport&#x27;s Terminal 2. This increased its passenger handling capacity to more than 20 million passengers a year.

===1992â2009===
In 1992, three companies within SATSÂ â Apron, Cargo and Passenger ServicesÂ â were merged to form a new company, SATS Airport Services (SAS). This consolidation was designed to improve co-ordination and communication, and strengthen the SATS Group&#x27;s competitiveness.

Over the next four years, an express courier centre, capable of handling 40,000 tonnes of cargo a year, was opened along with the S$215 million Airfreight Terminal 5, the S$172 million Inflight Catering Centre 2 and a S$40 million SATS Maintenance Centre.

At the end of the 1999â2000 financial year, SATS owned and operated five airfreight terminals with a combined handling capacity of 1.3 million tonnes of cargo a year and two catering centres capable of producing 27 million meals a year.

A second Express Courier Centre for partner DHL Worldwide Express, costing S$30 million, was completed in December 2001.

In the first quarter of 2001, a sixth airfreight terminal costing S$270 million with a handling capacity of 800,000 tonnes of cargo per annum commenced operations.

2003 saw the launch of SATS&#x27; web-based system, CargoNet, to further complement its cargo tracking service. It also upgraded the materials handling system in Airfreight Terminals 1 to 4 to improve cargo handling efficiency and equipment serviceability.

In July 2005, SATS launched a range of new products and service upgrades.

On 2 January 2008, SATS sold the Express Courier Centre Two (ECC2) to DHL Express.

====1st re-branding exercise====
SATS underwent a re-branding exercise in Apr 2007, adopting a completely new brand identity after bearing the SIA &#x27;bird&#x27; logo for many decades.

===2010âpresent===
In December 2010, SATS Ltd completed the acquisition of Japan Airlines International&#x27;s entire stake of 50.7 per cent in TFK Corporation. The 7.8 billion yen (S$122 million) purchase, was fully satisfied in cash and funded through debt through its wholly owned subsidiary SATS Investments Pte Ltd (SIPL). Following the completion, SIPL now owns 504,195 shares in TFK and has voting rights of 53.8 per cent.

On 25 October 2011, SATS announced that it will be selling Daniels Group to Hain Celestial Group.

On 23 December 2011, the SATS-Creuers consortium (a joint venture between SATS Ltd. (SATS) and Creuers del Port de Barcelona S.A. (Creuers)) won the bid to manage the new Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SATS-Creuers beat out competition from the Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC), the incumbent cruise port operator in Singapore, which operates the existing facilities at HarbourFront and Jurong Port.

====2nd re-branding exercise====
SATS used to be part of the Singapore Airlines Group and was divested from SIA on 1 Sep 2009.

On 08 January 2010, it unveiled a new uniform for its front-line staff at the Singapore Changi Airport. The uniform change is SATS&#x27; eleventh since 1973.

The company also changed its name from &quot;Singapore Airport Terminal Services Limited to &quot;SATS Ltd&quot;. on 30 July 2010.

On 7 June 2011, SATS unveiled a new brand identity. The group was initially engaged in ground handling and airline catering in Singapore. It has since transformed itself into Asia&#x27;s largest gateway services and aviation food services network and has operations at 60 locations in 14 countries.

===Acquisition of Worldwide Flight Services===
On 28 September 2022, SATS announced its acquisition of the world&#x27;s largest air cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) for $1.64 billion.

On 5 November 2024, SATS and its wholly-owned subsidiary Worldwide Flight Services (WFS), known collectively as the SATS Group, unveiled a new unified global visual identity. The refreshed logo and corporate colours reflect the integration of SATS and WFS, and their joint commitment and ambition to become the world&#x27;s leading aviation solutions provider.

This includes retaining the WFS brand name in the Americas and EMEAA in acknowledgement of its long track record of operational excellence and strong customer relationships.

The new corporate logo consists of a double loop and a &#x27;to the power of&#x27; mathematical symbol which symbolises the coming together of SATS and WFS to power a world of trade, travel and taste via the Group&#x27;s connected global network of aviation gateway services, air cargo handling, and food solutions.

<doc id="1153709" wikidata="Q640717" url="?curid=1153709" title="Joseph Colombo">
<text>Joseph Anthony Colombo Sr. (; June 16, 1923 â May 22, 1978) was the boss of the Colombo crime family, one of the Five Families of the American Mafia in New York City.

Colombo was born in New York City, where his father was an early member of what was then the Profaci crime family. In 1961, the First Colombo War unfolded, instigated by the kidnapping of four high-ranking members in the Profaci family by Joe Gallo. Later that year, Gallo was imprisoned, and in 1962, family leader Joe Profaci died of cancer. In 1963, Bonanno crime family boss, Joseph Bonanno made plans with Joseph Magliocco to assassinate several rivals on The Commission. Magliocco gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Colombo, who revealed the plot to its targets. The Commission spared Magliocco&#x27;s life but forced him into retirement, while Bonanno fled to Canada. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo was awarded the Profaci family. His only prison term would come in 1966, when Colombo was sentenced to 30 days in prison for contempt of court by refusing to answer questions from a grand jury about his financial affairs.

In 1970, Colombo created the Italian-American Civil Rights League. Later that year, the first Italian Unity Day rally was held in Columbus Circle to protest the federal persecution of Italians. In 1971, Gallo was released from prison, and Colombo invited him to a peace meeting with an offering of $1,000, which Gallo refused, instigating the Second Colombo War. On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times by Jerome Johnson at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian-American Civil Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards. Colombo was paralyzed from the shooting. On May 22, 1978, Colombo died of cardiac arrest that resulted from his injuries.

==Early life==
Joseph Colombo Sr. was born into an Italian American family on June 16, 1923, in Brooklyn. His father, Anthony Colombo, was an early member of the Profaci crime family, which would eventually be renamed after his son. In 1938, he was found strangled in a car with his mistress. Joe Colombo attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn for two years, then dropped out to join the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1945, he was diagnosed with neurosis and discharged from the service. His legitimate jobs included ten years as a longshoreman and six years as a salesman for a meat company. His final job was that of a real estate salesman.

Colombo owned a modest home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and a five-acre estate in Blooming Grove, New York. He married Lucille Faiello in 1944, and had five children including sons Christopher Colombo, Joseph Colombo Jr. (1946â2014) and Anthony Colombo (1945â2017).

==First Colombo War==
Colombo followed his father into the Profaci family. He became one of the family&#x27;s top enforcers, and soon became a capo.

On February 27, 1961, the Gallos kidnapped four of Profaci&#x27;s top men: underboss Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci&#x27;s brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme in return for the hostages&#x27; release. Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci made a deal with the Gallos. Profaci&#x27;s consigliere Charles &quot;the Sidge&quot; LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully. However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961, Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo family members Joseph &quot;Joe Jelly&quot; Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore &quot;Sally&quot; D&#x27;Ambrosio after a police officer intervened. The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists; The Gallos then began calling Persico &quot;The Snake&quot; after he had betrayed them. The war continued and resulted in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the gang war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory.

In late November 1961, Joe Gallo was sentenced to seven-to-fourteen years in prison for murder. On June 6, 1962, Profaci died and was succeeded by longtime underboss Joseph Magliocco. In 1963, Joseph Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, made plans to assassinate several rivals on the Mafia Commissionâbosses Tommy Lucchese, Carlo Gambino, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone. Bonanno sought Magliocco&#x27;s support, and Magliocco readily agreed. Bonanno was not only bitter from being denied a seat on the Commission, but he and Profaci had been close allies for over 30 years prior to Profaci&#x27;s death. Bonanno&#x27;s audacious goal was to take over the Commission and make Magliocco his right-hand man. Magliocco was assigned the task of killing Lucchese and Gambino, and gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Colombo. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to its targets. The other bosses quickly realized that Magliocco could not have planned this himself. Remembering how close Bonanno was with Magliocco (and before him, Profaci), as well as their close ties through marriages, the other bosses concluded Bonanno was the real mastermind. The Commission summoned Bonanno and Magliocco to explain themselves. Fearing for his life, Bonanno went into hiding in Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission. Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared Magliocco&#x27;s life, but forced him to retire as Profaci family boss and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo was awarded the Profaci family.

At the age of 41, Colombo was one of the youngest crime bosses in the country. He was also the first American-born boss of a New York crime family. When NYPD detective Albert Seedman (later the NYPD chief of detectives) called Colombo in for questioning about the death of one of his soldiers, Colombo came to the meeting without a lawyer. He told Seedman, &quot;I am an American citizen, first class. I don&#x27;t have a badge that makes me an official good guy like you, but I work just as honest for a living.&quot;

On May 9, 1966, Colombo was sentenced to 30 days in jail for contempt by refusing to answer questions from a grand jury about his financial affairs.

==Italian-American Civil Rights League==
In April 1970, Colombo created the Italian-American Civil Rights League. That same month, his son Joseph Colombo Jr. was charged with melting down coins for resale as silver ingots. In response, Joseph Colombo Sr. claimed FBI harassment of Italian-Americans and, on April 30, 1970, sent 30 picketers outside FBI headquarters at Third Avenue and 69th Street to protest the federal persecution of all Italians everywhere; this went on for weeks. On June 29, 1970, 50,000 people attended the first Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle in New York City. In February 1971, Colombo Jr. was acquitted of the federal charge after the chief witness in the trial was arrested on perjury charges.

Under Colombo&#x27;s guidance, the League grew quickly and achieved national attention. Unlike other mob leaders who shunned the spotlight, Colombo appeared on television interviews, fundraisers and speaking engagements for the League. In 1971, Colombo aligned the League with Rabbi and political activist Meir Kahane&#x27;s Jewish Defense League, claiming that both groups were being harassed by the federal government. At one point, Colombo posted bail for 11 jailed JDL members.

===&quot;The Godfather&quot;===
In the spring of 1971, Paramount Pictures started filming &quot;The Godfather&quot; with the assistance of Colombo and the League. Due to its subject matter, the film originally faced great opposition from Italian-Americans to filming in New York. However, after producer Albert Ruddy met with Colombo and agreed to excise the terms &quot;Mafia&quot; and &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; from the film, the League cooperated fully. The first meeting involved Ruddy, Colombo, Colombo&#x27;s son Anthony and 1500 delegates from Colombo&#x27;s Italian-American Civil Rights League. Ruddy would afterwards hold numerous meetings with Anthony, which led to assurance that the film would be based on individuals and would not defame or stereotype a group.

==Shooting==
In early 1971, Joe Gallo was released from prison. As a supposedly conciliatory gesture, Colombo invited Gallo to a peace meeting with an offering of $1,000. Gallo refused the invitation, wanting $100,000 to stop the conflict, which Colombo refused to pay. At that point, acting boss Vincenzo Aloi issued a new order to kill Gallo.

On March 11, 1971, after being convicted of perjury for lying on his application to become a real estate broker, Colombo was sentenced to two and half years in state prison. The sentence, however, was delayed pending an appeal.

On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times in the head and neck by Jerome A. Johnson, at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian-American Civil Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards.

===Aftermath===
Colombo was paralyzed from the shooting. On August 28, 1971, after two months at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan, Colombo was moved to his estate at Blooming Grove. In 1975, a court-ordered examination showed that Colombo could move his thumb and forefinger on his right hand. In 1976, there were reports that he could recognize people and utter several words.

After the Colombo shooting, Joseph Yacovelli became the acting boss for one year before Carmine Persico took over.

Although many in the Colombo family blamed Joe Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually concluded that Johnson was a lone gunman after they had questioned Gallo. Since Johnson had spent time a few days earlier at a Gambino club, one theory was that Carlo Gambino organized the shooting. Colombo refused to listen to Gambino&#x27;s complaints about the League, and allegedly spat in Gambino&#x27;s face during one argument. However, the Colombo family leadership was convinced that Joe Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family. Gallo was murdered on April 7, 1972.

==Death==
On May 22, 1978, Colombo died of cardiac arrest at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital (later St. Luke&#x27;s Cornwall Hospital) in Newburgh, New York.

Colombo&#x27;s funeral was held at St Bernadette&#x27;s Catholic Church in Bensonhurst and he was buried in Saint John Cemetery in the Middle Village section of Queens.

<text>Lythe is a small village and large civil parish, in North Yorkshire, England, situated near Whitby within the North York Moors National Park. The name of the village derives from Old Norse and means hill or slope. 

It was in the old North Riding and in the wapentake of Langbaurgh East until 1974. From 1974 to 2023 it was part of the Borough of Scarborough.

According to the 2011 UK census, Lythe parish had a population of 377, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 465.

== History ==
St Oswald&#x27;s Church is a plain stone building in the Early English style. The stained glass east window is a memorial to the Rev. William Long, who was vicar from 1813 to 1858. Inside the church are memorials to the Phipps family, and to the Marquess of Normanby. The register dates from 1634. There is also a Wesleyan Methodist chapel.

Mulgrave Castle is the seat of the Marquess of Normanby. The estate also contains the ruins of a former residence known locally as Mulgrave Old Castle, which was an earthwork motte and bailey fortress.

== Geography ==
Within the parish are the villages of Mickleby, Ugthorpe and Sandsend, and the hamlets of Barnby, Ellerby, Goldsborough, Hutton Mulgrave, Kettleness and Newton Mulgrave.

== Amenities ==
There are a variety of amenities in the village including a primary school, a community shop with post office, tennis courts and a retained fire station. The old &quot;Red Lion&quot; public house has recently been renamed &quot;The Stiddy&quot;. A &quot;stiddy&quot; is an anvil packed full of gunpowder and fired like a cannon on special occasions, such as the birth of the Marquess&#x27; male heir, the jubilee, or the end of the Second World War.

== Sport and culture ==
Lythe is the home of Mulgrave Cricket Club. The club&#x27;s home ground is on Lythe Sports Field, located on the High Street, exiting west of the village. The club has two senior XI teams that compete in the Scarborough Beckett Cricket League.

== Anecdotes ==
Scenes from the 2017 film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; were filmed in the village.

<doc id="1153819" wikidata="Q410336" url="?curid=1153819" title="Cordierite">
<text>Cordierite (mineralogy) or iolite (gemology) is a magnesium iron aluminium cyclosilicate. Iron is almost always present, and a solid solution exists between Mg-rich cordierite and Fe-rich sekaninaite with a series formula: to . A high-temperature polymorph exists, indialite, which is isostructural with beryl and has a random distribution of Al in the rings. Cordierite is also synthesized and used in high temperature applications such as catalytic converters and pizza stones.

==Name and discovery==
Cordierite, which was discovered in 1813, in specimens from NÃ­jar, AlmerÃ­a, Spain, is named after the French geologist Louis Cordier (1777â1861).

==Occurrence==
Cordierite typically occurs in contact or regional metamorphism of pelitic rocks. It is especially common in hornfels produced by contact metamorphism of pelitic rocks. Two common metamorphic mineral assemblages include sillimanite-cordierite-spinel and cordierite-spinel-plagioclase-orthopyroxene. Other associated minerals include garnet (cordierite-garnet-sillimanite gneisses) and anthophyllite. Cordierite also occurs in some granites, pegmatites, and norites in gabbroic magmas. Alteration products include mica, chlorite, and talc. Cordierite occurs, for example, in the granite contact zone at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall.

==Commercial use==
Catalytic converters are commonly made from ceramics containing a large proportion of synthetic cordierite. The manufacturing process deliberately aligns the cordierite crystals to make use of the very low thermal expansion along one axis. This prevents thermal shock cracking from taking place when the catalytic converter is used.

==Gem variety==

As the transparent variety iolite, it is often used as a gemstone. The name &quot;iolite&quot; comes from the Greek word for violet. Another old name is &quot;dichroite&quot;, a Greek word meaning &quot;two-colored rock&quot;, a reference to cordierite&#x27;s strong pleochroism. It has also been called &quot;water-sapphire&quot; and &quot;Vikings&#x27; Compass&quot; because of its usefulness in determining the direction of the sun on overcast days, the Vikings having used it for this purpose. This works by determining the direction of polarization of the sky overhead. Light scattered by air molecules is polarized, and the direction of the polarization is at right angles to a line to the sun, even when the sun&#x27;s disk itself is obscured by dense fog or lies just below the horizon.

Gem quality iolite varies in color from sapphire blue to blue violet to yellowish gray to light blue as the light angle changes. Iolite is sometimes used as an inexpensive substitute for sapphire. It is much softer than sapphires and is abundantly found in Australia (Northern Territory), Brazil, Burma, Canada (Yellowknife area of the Northwest Territories), India, Madagascar, Namibia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the United States (Connecticut). The largest iolite crystal found weighed more than 24,000 carats (4,800g), and was discovered in Wyoming, US.
Another name for blue iolite is steinheilite, after Fabian Steinheil, the Russian military governor of Finland who observed that it was a different mineral from quartz. Praseolite is another iolite variety which results from heat treatment. It should not be confused with prasiolite.

== Applications ==
Cordierite is used in manufacturing kiln furniture for its impressive thermal shock resistance, which allows it to withstand rapid temperature changes without cracking. It is also employed to produce insulation equipment and electric heating elements in fuses, thermostats, and lighting technology.

In the automotive industry, cordierite is used in catalytic converters due to its excellent thermal stability and low thermal expansion. It forms the honeycomb substrates within the converters, which support the catalytic coating that reduces harmful emissions.

<doc id="1153821" wikidata="Q5073336" url="?curid=1153821" title="Chapman strut">
<text>The Chapman strut is a design of independent rear suspension used for light cars, particularly sports and racing cars. It takes its name from, and is best known for its use by, Colin Chapman of Lotus.

The characteristic feature of the Chapman strut is a long upright strut combining a coil spring and shock absorber, with a universal-jointed drive shaft itself forming the lower link of the suspension.

== Origins ==
=== Stout Scarab ===
The design&#x27;s origin lies with William Stout&#x27;s 1932 Stout Scarab. This rear-engined car used swing axle independent rear suspension, with long near-vertical coilover struts from high mounting points on the space frame chassis. Stout had also been an aircraft designer and considered that the long-travel oleo struts made, &quot; &#x27;the airplane landing gear &quot;[is]&quot; the easiest type of running gear for comfort yet devised.&#x27; &quot; The lower ends of the struts were attached to the swing axle casings by swivel bushes. Forward radius rods handled the longitudinal forces.

=== MacPherson strut ===
In 1947 Earle MacPherson patented the MacPherson strut for use on the Chevrolet Cadet. This was the first true &quot;strut suspension&quot; for cars: the stub axle was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout&#x27;s Scarab. 

MacPherson&#x27;s strut took advantage of the unitary car bodies appearing in new factories after World War II: the strut requires a high top mounting point, which would be difficult to arrange for a ladder chassis, but is also advantageous for unitary construction as it distributes suspension loads over a greater volume of the bodyshell. New car designs were also lighter and faster than pre-war cars, a cheap mass-production car now having performance that would previously have been the preserve of an expensive sports car. Drivers demanded roadholding and comfort that required independent front suspension. MacPherson&#x27;s strut was cheap to manufacture and reliable in service, having few moving joints and using the new telescopic shock absorbers, rather than the previous lever arms. MacPherson&#x27;s strut also integrated an anti-roll bar, not only for control of body roll but also re-using it as an integral part of the suspension and so avoiding the need for a wishbone or radius rod in favour of a simple track control arm.

The MacPherson strut appears to have had little influence on Chapman at this time (although he would later use it unsuccessfully for the front suspension of his Lotus 17). Double wishbone suspension was already well-established for the front of high-performance cars. A front strut would also have required much greater height than was available in a racing car.

=== Goggomobil ===
In 1957, the lightweight Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces passing through the inboard Hooke joints. The swing axle shafts were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.

=== Chapman&#x27;s design ===

In 1956 Chapman was using deÂ Dion rear axles for his Lotus racing cars and also the Vanwall. These had initially used transverse leaf springs, but later changed to coilover shock absorbers. Chapman had identified some of the deÂ Dion&#x27;s disadvantages as including its high unsprung weight, the need for sliding splines in the rear driveshafts, and also (a typical Chapman fixation) its insensitivity to changes in weight as fuel is consumed. The first Lotus Twelve Formula 2 cars used the same system, although the deÂ Dion&#x27;s mass was a drawback for a lightweight single-seater racing car.

At a 750 Motor Club meeting in 1957, Chapman saw the Goggomobil system and was impressed by its Lotus-like simplicity and light weight. The use of the drive shafts for both drive and as a suspension component appealed to Chapman, who always favoured solutions that could make one component do double duty. 

Chapman struts were introduced in Lotus&#x27; first single-seater car, the Lotus Twelve. This was developed as a 1.5-litre Formula 2 in 1957, but re-engined in 1958 it also competed in Formula 1. This same car also introduced Lotus&#x27; wobbly-web wheel.

There were two differences from these precursors to the Chapman strut. As the Lotus Twelve had inboard disk brakes, there was no need to pass the braking torque through the radius rods. Chapman also avoided the swing axle and its camber changes with suspension travel, in favour of a drive shaft with two universal joints. The connection between the hub carrier and the shock absorber base was made rigid, making the spring unit into a strut and also controlling the camber angle. Using the drive shaft itself to control the rear track meant that the shaft could be of fixed length, avoiding the need for a sliding spline joint and its stiction problems.

Chapman applied for a patent on his strut design on 13 June 1957.

The Chapman strut also appeared on the Lotus Sixteen of 1958. In 1959 this design was revised to use a lower wishbone. This in turn required a return to a sliding joint in the drive shaft.

== Comparison to the MacPherson strut ==
The Chapman strut is often confused with the MacPherson strut, as both use a near-vertical upper strut, The distinction is that the MacPherson strut always requires a lower track control arm where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light radius rod.

As it requires a drive shaft, the Chapman strut can only be used at the driven end of the vehicle. For the Lotus designs to which it was applied, this was their rear. MacPherson struts are most commonly used for front suspension and the strut axis forms the kingpin bearing, for steering movement. There is little reason why a Chapman strut could not be used similarly, although there is no record of this being tried on a front-wheel or four-wheel drive car. Both designs are struts, where the strut base is rigidly attached to the hub carrier.

Chapman did use MacPherson struts for the front suspension of the Lotus 17. These were unsuccessful, owing to the stiction problems that Chapman had worked to avoid with the sliding drive shaft joint. A wishbone conversion kit was later developed by ex-Lotus engineer Len Terry.

=== Road cars ===

Lotus road cars after the Twelve also used the Chapman strut for rear suspension. These included the fibreglass platform-chassis Elite and the backbone chassis Elan. Chapman struts, and their wide separation of load paths into the chassis, were a good fit to a stressed-skin structure such as the Elite and may have been an influence on its choice. They were less appropriate for a backbone chassis, requiring broad outriggers to carry the strut top loads, an un-Chapman-like feature that added weight for only a single purpose and was difficult to make stiff enough. It has been suggested that the spring forces from these struts would have been better supported as torsion bars, which could then have been anchored to the main suspension spine.

The mid-engined Europa used a modified version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the rubber mounts led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. Rubber sandwich mounts were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the rubber mounts.

:* Lotus Elan
:* Lotus Europa

== Successor designs ==

The successful mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 no longer had the high bodywork behind the driver&#x27;s seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again in the style of the Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm.

The 2016 all wheel drive version of the Fiat 500X crossover based on the Jeep Renegade uses multi-link Chapman strut suspension at the rear, with MacPherson struts at the front. Although the driveshafts are a suspension link, making this a Chapman strut, there are additional transverse links as well.

<text>The heist film or caper film is a subgenre of crime films and the caper story, focused on the planning, execution, and aftermath of a significant robbery.

One of the early defining heist films was &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950), which &quot;Film Genre 2000&quot; wrote &quot;almost single-handedly popularized the genre for mainstream cinema&quot;. It featured robbers whose personal failings ultimately led to the failure of their robbery. Similar films using this formula were &quot;Armored Car Robbery&quot; (1950), &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972). By the 1990s, heist films began to &quot;experiment and play with these conventions,&quot; incorporating elements such as comedy into their stories.

== Characteristics of the genre ==
While there is no unanimous agreement on what constitutes a heist film, there are some common characteristics that most films in the genre share.

The most basic is that films in the genre tend to follow the planning, execution and aftermath of one large robbery. While there can be smaller crimes leading up to the major crime, this major crime is the centerpiece of the film and is the event which informs much of the film&#x27;s plot. As a result of this, heist films tend to focus on the process of the crime, often planned in great detail, followed by extended exposition of the heist itself.

The genre is also distinct for almost exclusively following those committing the crime rather than whoever is trying to stop them. This often leads to the viewer building some form of sympathy or respect for the criminals. Another common characteristic is the assembling of a team to complete the heist, with each member contributing a unique skill or trait needed to complete the job.

Over time filmmakers have taken these characteristics and changed them to create interesting plays on the genre. For example, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) skips the execution of the heist and most of its planning, choosing instead to focus almost exclusively on the aftermath. Another example of this is &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), which shows the planning and execution of the heist but doesn&#x27;t fully show the aftermath.

Other tropes of the genre include the failure of the heist due to fate, or the traits of the criminals involved. Among them is one of the participants getting injured during the heist, or betraying the others during or after. This trend started as a result of the initial films in the genre being made in Hollywood during the Motion Picture Production Code, which prohibited criminals from getting away with their crime. While this has changed since the disappearance of the code, the trope of failed heists still remains. One of the most dynamic examples is &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, which focuses solely on trying to figure out which of their group members betrayed them after a failed heist. Another popular trope is &quot;one last job&quot;, whereby a criminal looking to quit the life enlists the team to commit one last heist so they will have money for the rest of their days. This can be seen in early films such as &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950) as well as more recent like &quot;Heat&quot; (1995).

== History ==
While elements of the heist film can be seen in movies as early as &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903), the genre didn&#x27;t become fully fledged until the late 1940s and the early 1950s. The film widely agreed upon as the first to do so is John Huston&#x27;s 1950 &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, starring Sterling Hayden and Sam Jaffee (with Marilyn Monroe in a supporting role). It contains many of the heist hallmarks, focusing from the criminal&#x27;s perspective on the elaborate planning, flawed execution, and calamitous aftermath of a single heist. It also devotes a large amount of time to the recruiting of variously skilled criminals to form a team.

Two earlier films that some consider prior examples of the genre, and others just key to its development, are &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946). While these do follow the planning, execution, and aftermath of a single heist from the criminals&#x27; perspective, some critics argue that they devote too much time to the planning and aftermath of the crime and too little to the actual job. All of these films are also notable for having elements which are indebted to film noir, including their moody, expressionistic black and white cinematography and dark fatalistic tone. As a result, scholars such as Daryl Lee refer to such examples as ânoir heistsâ. Anne Billson of the BBC cites Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) as an influence on the &quot;assembling the team&quot; trope that later became a common characteristic of heist films.

The period between 1955 and 1975 is considered by scholars to be the most productive for the heist genre. It began with American filmmakers continuing the noir heist trend in films like &quot;5 Against the House&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956). The â50s also saw the release of the first international heist films. Notably, a handful made in France were influenced by and responding to the American style. Two notable examples are &quot;Rififi&quot; (1955), which is known for its detailed 30 minute heist sequence, and &quot;Bob Le Flambeur&quot; (1956), known for an ending which plays with the conventions of the genre. The 1950s also marked the beginning of British heist film, including &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Lady Killers&quot; (1955), pictures which introduced comedy to the genre. A notable Italian heist film from this period is &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; (1958), a parody of the genre.

In the 1960s heist stories became more mainstream, with glossier and higher-budget heist films which moved away from the fatalism and darkness present in the earlier noir heists. Two examples of this from the early 1960s are the British film &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; (1960) and the American film &quot;Seven Thieves&quot; (1960). Despite having conventional heist plots about gathering together a group to commit a heist, both films balance comedy and drama, unlike the darkness of the earlier noir heist films. The mainstream shift as well as a growing cultural interest in travel led to a wave of glossy heist films involving exotic international locals, such as &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) and &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966). In France &quot;Rififi&quot; spawned a number of lower-budget crime films which often used &quot;Rififi&quot; as part of their title. These include films such as &quot;Rififi in Tokyo&quot; (1963) and &quot;Du rififi Ã  Paname&quot; (1966). As the decade continued, the French also began to produce more glossy heist films which served as star vehicles for big names of the time, such as &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot; (1963) starring Alain Delon and &quot;Greed in the Sun&quot; (1964) starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. The most celebrated French heist films of this time were directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, whose heist film &quot;Le Cercle Rouge&quot; (1970) is often regarded as one of the greatest heist movies of all time. This expansion of the genre in the 1960s also led to remakes of older heist movies, with an early example being &quot;Cairo&quot; (1963), which is a remake of &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;. In 1968, the motion picture production code was abolished, paving the way for a number of heist films that didn&#x27;t shy away from portraying graphic violence. This included films like &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972).

The period between 1975 and the early 1990s is considered a low point for productivity in the heist genre. While some were made, such as &quot;Thief&quot; (1981) and a remake of &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; called &quot;Crackers&quot; (1984), some critics do not consider them as meaningful developments of the genre. The 1990s would see the return of the heist film, with a number creating new interest. While pictures like John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1991) and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998) would bring some attention to the genre, the three that returned the genre to prominence were &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995).

This led to a large output of heist films throughout the 2000s. These range from British efforts like &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000) and &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; (2000) to kids&#x27; films like &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009) to popular Hollywood films like &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2006) and remakes of heist classics like &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (2003). Some of the most popular heist films of this era are the remake of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (2001) and its sequels &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 12&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 13&quot; (2007), which remain so today.

<text>Walter Jackson Ong, (November 30, 1912 â August 12, 2003) was an American Jesuit priest, professor of English literature, cultural and religious historian, and philosopher. His major interest was in exploring how the transition from orality to literacy influenced culture and changed human consciousness. In 1978 he served as elected president of the Modern Language Association.

==Biography==
Ong was born on November 30, 1912 in Kansas City, Missouri. His parents were Walter Jackson Ong and Blanche Eugenia Ong (). In 1929 he graduated from Rockhurst High School. In 1933 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Rockhurst College, where he majored in Latin. During his time at Rockhurst College, he founded a chapter of the Catholic fraternity Alpha Delta Gamma. He worked in printing and publishing prior to entering the Society of Jesus in 1935, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1946.

In 1940 Ong earned a master&#x27;s degree in English at Saint Louis University. His thesis on sprung rhythm in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins was supervised by the young Canadian Marshall McLuhan. Ong also received the degrees Licentiate of Philosophy and Licentiate of Sacred Theology from Saint Louis University.

After completing his dissertation on the French logician and educational reformer Peter Ramus (1515â1572) and Ramism under the supervision of Perry Miller at Harvard University in 1954, Ong returned to Saint Louis University, where he would teach for the next 30 years. In 1955 he received his PhD in English from Harvard University.

In 1963 the French government honored Ong for his work on Ramus by dubbing him a knight, &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Palmes acadÃ©miques&quot;. In 1966â1967 he served on the 14-member White House Task Force on Education that reported to President Lyndon Johnson. In 1971 Ong was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1974, he served as Lincoln Lecturer abroad for the Board of Foreign Scholarships. In 1967 he served as president of the Milton Society of America. In 1978 he served as elected president of the Modern Language Association of America. He was very active on the lecture circuit as well as in professional organizations.

Ong died in 2003 in St. Louis, Missouri.

==Summary of Ong&#x27;s works and interests==

A major concern of Ong&#x27;s works is the impact that the shift from orality to literacy has had on culture and education. Writing is a technology like other technologies (fire, the steam engine, etc.) that, when introduced to a &quot;primary oral culture&quot; (which has never known writing) has extremely wide-ranging impacts in all areas of life. These include culture, economics, politics, art, and more. Furthermore, even a small amount of education in writing transforms people&#x27;s mentality from the holistic immersion of orality to interiorization and individuation.

Many of the effects of the introduction of the technology of writing are related to the fact that oral cultures require strategies of preserving information in the absence of writing. These include, for example, a reliance on proverbs or condensed wisdom for making decisions, epic poetry, and stylized culture heroes (wise Nestor, crafty Odysseus). Writing makes these features no longer necessary, and introduces new strategies of remembering cultural material, which itself now changes.

Because cultures at any given time vary along a continuum between full orality and full literacy, Ong distinguishes between primary oral cultures (which have never known writing), cultures with craft literacy (such as scribes), and cultures in a transition phase from orality to literacy, in which some people know of writing but are illiterate - these cultures have &quot;residual orality&quot;.

Some of Ong&#x27;s interests:
# the historical development of visualist tendencies in Western philosophic thought
# the mathematical transformation of thought in medieval and early modern logic and beyond
# oral cyclic thought, which is characteristic of primary oral cultures, versus linear or historical or evolutionary thought, which depends on writing
# the movement from oral heroic poetry to mock-heroic poetry in print culture to the realist tradition in literature to the modern antihero
# the historical development in manuscript culture and print culture of the inward turn of personalized ego-consciousness, or individuality
# the new dimensions of orality fostered by modern communication media that accentuate sound, which Ong calls secondary orality as it succeeds from, relies on, and coexists with writing
# the origins and development of the Western educational system
# the role and effects of Learned Latin in Western culture

==Major works==

===&quot;Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue&quot; (1958)===
According to Adrian Johns&#x27; foreword to the 2004 edition, Ong was urged to research Ramus after his graduate mentor, Marshall McLuhan had no particular interest in Ong&#x27;s original subject, Gerard Manley Hopkins. McLuhan vigorously encouraged Ong&#x27;s work, and eventually drew upon his former student&#x27;s perspective on Ramism to write his own pivotal work, &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;.

&quot;Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason&quot; (1958) elaborates the contrast between the visual and the oral that Ong found in Louis Lavelle&#x27;s &quot;La parole et l&#x27;ecriture&quot; (1942). Ong details how the spatialization and quantification of thought in dialectic and logic during the Middle Ages enabled &quot;a new state of mind&quot; to emerge in print culture, which is associated with the emergence of modern science.

The companion volume, &quot;Ramus and Talon Inventory&quot; (1958) is a notable work that contributes to the field known today as book history. Therein, Ong briefly describes more than 750 volumes (mostly in Latin) that he had tracked down in more than 100 libraries in Europe.

Peter Ramus (1515â1572), was a French humanist, logician, and educational reformer whose textbook method of analyzing subjects was very widely adopted in many academic fields. In &quot;Ramist Classroom Procedure and the Nature of Reality&quot;, Ong discusses Ramism as a transition phase between the Classical style of education and the modern one. He writes, &quot;...Ramism might seem merely quaint, perhaps artistically lethal, but of no great importance. Yet its great spread will hardly allow us to regard it as educationally insignificant. As a matter of fact, it has educational significance of the headiest sort, for it implies no less than that it is the &quot;arts&quot; or curriculum subjects which hold the world together. Nothing is accessible for &quot;use,&quot; that is, for active intussusception (the assimilation of new material and its dispersal among preexistent matter) by the human being, until it has first been put through the curriculum. The schoolroom is by implication the doorway to reality, and indeed the only doorway.&quot;

===&quot;The Presence of the Word&quot; (1967)===
&quot;The Presence of the Word: Some Prolegomena for Cultural and Religious History&quot; (1967) is an expanded version of his 1964 Terry Lectures at Yale University. It is a pioneering work in cultural studies and media ecology.

He writes, &quot;[my] works do not maintain that the evolution from primary orality through writing and print to an electronic culture, which produces secondary orality, causes or explains everything in human culture and consciousness. Rather, [my] thesis is relationist: major developments, and very likely even all major developments, in culture and consciousness, are related, often in unexpected intimacy, to the evolution of the word from primary orality to its present state. But the relationships are varied and complex, with cause and effect often difficult to distinguish&quot;.

===&quot;Fighting for Life&quot; (1981)===
Ong subsequently developed his observations regarding polemic in &quot;The Presence of the Word&quot; (192â286) in his book length study &quot;Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness&quot; (1981), the published version of his 1979 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University.

===&quot;Orality and Literacy&quot; (1982)===
In Ong&#x27;s most widely known work, &quot;Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word&quot; (1982), he attempts to identify the distinguishing characteristics of orality by examining thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.

Ong drew heavily on the work of Eric A. Havelock, who suggested a fundamental shift in the form of thought coinciding with the transition from orality to literacy in Ancient Greece. Ong describes writing as a technology that must be laboriously learned, and which effects the first transformation of human thought from the world of sound to the world of sight. This transition has implications for structuralism, deconstruction, speech-act and reader-response theory, the teaching of reading and writing skills to males and females, social studies, biblical studies, philosophy, and cultural history generally.

===&quot;An Ong Reader&quot; (2002)===
This 600-page selection of Ong&#x27;s works is organized on the themes of orality and rhetoric. It includes his 1967 encyclopedia article on the &quot;Written Transmission of Literature&quot; (331â44); his most frequently cited article, his 1975 &quot;PMLA&quot; article &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Audience Is Always a Fiction&quot; (405â27); and his most frequently reprinted article, his 1978 &quot;ADE Bulletin&quot; article &quot;Literacy and Orality in Our Times&quot; (465â78). Taken together, these three essays make up a coherent approach to the study of written literature against the background of oral tradition.

<text>A coilover is an automobile suspension device. The name coilover is an abbreviation of &quot;coil over shock absorber&quot;.

== Description ==
Coilovers are found on many vehicles, from RC cars to normal passenger cars, race cars and 4x4 vehicles. They are sometimes used as a factory suspension option on new cars. Coilovers are used in double wishbone suspension systems, and are often a component of MacPherson struts.

Two of the main types of coilovers are full coilovers and slip-on coilovers. Full coilovers are matched up with a shock absorber from the factory, while with slip-on coilovers, the dampers and springs are bought separately and then assembled.

There are a large number of companies who make aftermarket coilovers for vehicles, many of which allow the customer to adjust various settings such as ride height and damping. Camber and caster angles can also be adjusted if the car&#x27;s suspension allows, and if the coilovers are supplied with adjustable top mounts. This high degree of adjustment is what gives coilovers an advantage over typical MacPherson struts.

Coilovers can be used to lower the vehicle&#x27;s centre of gravity, and to increase the roll stiffness of the vehicle to reduce weight transfer when the vehicle changes direction.

== Components ==
A coilover consists of a damper, with a coil spring encircling it. The damper and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when either of the sub-components fails.

Some coilovers are adjustable. Most, if not all, adjustable coilovers have variable ride height and preload, adjusted using a simple threaded spring perch similar to a nut. Alternatively, the damper&#x27;s threaded body is matched to a threaded bottom mount which allows ride height adjustment without affecting bump travel. Most coilovers also have adjustable dampers, which are usually adjusted with an adjustment knob on top of the damper. Stiffness can be changed by switching the spring for one with a different spring rate or by adjusting the stiffness of the damper.

Coilovers are made up of several components, including the damper, coil spring, bushing, bump stops, upper and lower mounts, various nuts and washers, threaded sleeves, and collars.

=== Springs ===
The purpose of coilover springs is to prevent the chassis from bottoming out, support each individual wheel on the vehicle, and mitigate or reduce body roll when taking turns and cornering, particularly at higher speeds. The springs also help to reduce squatting when accelerating and diving when decelerating. They are often used to adjust the vehicle&#x27;s ride height, which directly affects handling and comfort.

==== Spring preload ====
Preload is the pressure exerted on a spring over the distance it is compressed. A higher preload means a stiffer spring and a lower preload results in a softer spring with more travel. This is true if the coilover uses progressive springs. On coilovers with linear springs preload has no effect on spring rate. More preload can increase grip when cornering, but too much preload can make a spring too stiff. In coilovers with adjustable spring seats, linear rate springs and no helper or tender springs, ride height must be adjusted through preload. This can present a problem for vehicles whose ride height needs to be lowered but whose springs are already stiff enough.

=== Dampers ===
A mono-tube coilover is a single piston and rod assembly in a damping case in which both compression and rebound occur. A larger mono-tube shock will be able to displace more hydraulic fluid, providing a more sensitive response to small suspension movements than twin-tube shocks.

A twin-tube coilover is more complex than a mono-tube assembly. Twin-tubes have an inner cylinder which moves up and down, and an outer cylinder which serves as a hydraulic reserve. This design allows for an increase in suspension stroke, which provides better ride quality and handling.

=== Adjustable coilovers ===
Adjustable coilovers allow adjustment of the vehicle&#x27;s suspension in four main areas:

* Roll stiffness: By fitting springs with a higher spring rate, roll stiffness can be increased. Likewise, a lower spring rate results in increased roll.
* Ride height: By using threaded spring seats or threaded bottom brackets, the ride height of the vehicle can be raised or lowered. The bottom mount is a threaded sleeve with two adjuster nuts that are used to preload the coils and increase or decrease ride height.
* Compression and rebound: The stiffness of the compression and rebound of the suspension can be adjusted if the coilovers use adjustable dampers. Adjustable dampers fall into three main categories: those that adjust compression only, those that adjust rebound only, those that adjust rebound and compression in parallel, and those that are adjustable for rebound and compression independently. This later category can be split further into dampers that have low-speed adjustment and those that have independent high- and low-speed adjustment. An example of high speed in the context of suspension movement would be a car hitting a bump; an example of slow speed movement would be a car changing direction.
* Camber and caster: Some coilover suspension kits may also be supplied with adjustable top mounts. Depending on the design of the car&#x27;s suspension these top mounts can allow the adjustment of camber and/or caster. Some coilovers use the car&#x27;s original top mounts and are therefore not adjustable.

== Compression &amp; rebound ==
Compression occurs when the piston inside the damper is moved inwards, increasing the pressure of the fluid in the chamber. Adjusting compression changes the motion of the vehicle&#x27;s unsprung weight, modifying how quickly weight will shift downwards towards the wheel. Rebound is the result of the piston moving back after having been compressed, resulting in compression of the fluid once more. Adjustments made to rebound control the motion of the vehicle&#x27;s sprung weight, changing how rapidly weight will be shifted away from the wheel.

== Coilover Alternatives ==
Nitrogen-charged struts can be used as a more stable alternative to coilovers since they do not unload or push off, increasing stability.

<doc id="1153848" wikidata="Q414501" url="?curid=1153848" title="Piperine">
<text>Piperine, possibly along with its isomer chavicine, is the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper and long pepper. It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine.

==Preparation==
Due to its poor solubility in water, piperine is typically extracted from black pepper by using organic solvents like dichloromethane. The amount of piperine varies from 1â2% in long pepper, to 5â10% in commercial white and black peppers.

Piperine can also be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from a concentrated alcoholic extract of black pepper with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine). The solution is decanted from the insoluble residue and left to stand overnight in alcohol. During this period, the alkaloid slowly crystallizes from the solution.

Piperine has been synthesized by the action of piperonoyl chloride on piperidine.

==Reactions==
Piperine forms salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4Â·H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (&quot;B&quot; denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2Â·HIÂ·I2, crystallizing in steel-blue needles with melting point 145Â Â°C.

Piperine can be hydrolyzed by an alkali into piperidine and piperic acid.

In light, especially ultraviolet light, piperine is changed into its isomers chavicine, isochavicine and isopiperine, which are tasteless.

==History==
Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ãrsted, who isolated it from the fruits of &quot;Piper nigrum&quot;, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in &quot;Piper longum&quot; and &quot;Piper officinarum&quot; (Miq.) C. DC. (=&quot;Piper retrofractum&quot; Vahl), two species called &quot;long pepper&quot;.

<text>Kaw Lake is a reservoir completed in 1976 in the northern reaches of the U.S. state of Oklahoma, near Kaw City which is located on a hill overlooking the lake. The lake is approximately east of Ponca City. Newkirk is west of the upper end of the lake.

Kaw Dam is long and above the stream bed. The dam lies above the mouth of the Arkansas River. The top of the flood control pool is , while the normal operating level is 1,010 feet.

The Reservoir covers approximately 17,040 acres (69Â kmÂ²). It is the seventh largest lake in Oklahoma by surface area. At normal levels, the lake holds of water, the ninth largest lake in capacity in Oklahoma. (See List of lakes in Oklahoma) It lies mostly in Kay County and partially in Osage County.

Kaw Dam was authorized by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1962. Ground was broken for the dam on May 21, 1966. The original town of Kaw City was covered by the waters of Kaw Lake in 1975. The city was rebuilt about two miles west of the old site during the late 1960s. The dam was completed by the Corps of Engineers in May 1976. The cost of the dam and the lake was $111 million.

The Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA), a state governmental agency created in 1981 to provide wholesale electricity to cities and towns in Oklahoma, purchased the substructure of the dam in July 1987 at a cost of $3.8 million and constructed a hydroelectric plant that was completed in September 1989 at a cost of $25 million. Kaw Hydroelectric generates approximately 104 gigawatt hours of energy annually. The generator is nominally rated at 25.6 megawatts at of gross head with a maximum rating of 36.7 MVA. The plant at Kaw Dam provides power for over 35 municipal electrical systems in Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The project engineer for the Kaw Lake dam was Everette W. Woodham, Jr.

The Corps of Engineers and Camp McFadden offers camping on the west shore of Kaw Lake at Ponca Cove.

The City of Enid began a project in 2020 to lay a 70-mile pipeline to tap Kaw Lake as a municipal water source. The project will transport 10 million gallons of water per day.

== Camp McFadden ==
Camp McFadden is an outdoor recreational area on over overlooking the west side of Kaw Lake near Ponca City, Oklahoma. Camp McFadden was created in 1927 as a children&#x27;s camp by Bill McFadden on the Kygar ranch. The camp includes high and low ropes courses, cabins, a lodge with full kitchen, outdoor activities, and RV and tent camping and is used for team building, reunions, youth and church camps, weddings, and getaways. Future plans include a volleyball court, disc golf, softball field, soccer field and archery range. Camp McFadden is a non-profit 501(c)(3).

<text>Gaspard Dughet (15 June 1615 â 25 May 1675), also known as Gaspard Poussin, was a French painter born in Rome.

==Life==
Dughet was born in Rome, the son of a French pastry-cook
 and his Italian wife. He has always generally been considered as a French painter, although in fact he never visited France. Between around 1631 and 1635 he became a pupil of Nicolas Poussin, who had married his sister Anne five years earlier. Because of this connection he was widely known as &quot;Gaspard Poussin.&quot; After leaving Poussin&#x27;s studio his works developed a more fluid style and developed his pictures of storms which account for 30 out of his 400 known works. 

He specialised in painting landscapes of the Roman Campagna becoming, along with his exact contemporary Salvator Rosa, one of the two leading landscape painters of his time. He painted several cycles of frescoes, including one, showing various sites around Rome, at the Colonna Palace. He worked with Pier Francesco Mola, Cozza, and Mattia Preti at the Palazzo Pamphilj in Valmontone. He often collaborated with Guillaume Courtois who painted the staffage in his landscapes. This was the case, for instance, in the works for the Palazzo Pamphilj. There is another fresco cycle by Dughet, though in a bad state of preservation, in San Martino ai Monti.

Dughet died in Rome on 25 May 1675.

==Influence==
During the 18th century Dughet&#x27;s work became especially popular amongst British collectors, to such an extent that his name became attached to almost any classical landscape, and his style proved influential on British landscape painting and garden design. His &quot;Sacrifice of Abraham&quot;, once the property of the Colonna, is now, with other of his works, in the National Gallery, London. Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable were inspired by Dughet and recommended him as a model. 

His pupils included Crescenzio Onofri (1634â1712/14), Jacques de Rooster (fl. late 17th century) and Jan Frans van Bloemen (1662â1749).

<text>Gesalic (Gothic: ð²ð°ð¹ðð°ð»ð°ð¹ðºð, romanized: &quot;Gaisalaiks&quot;, &quot;dancing with spears&quot;), &quot;Gesaleico&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese, &quot;Gesaleic&quot; in Catalan, ( â 513), was a king of the Visigoths from 507 to 511, and died in 513.

==Biography==
Although the illegitimate son of Alaric II, he had been elected king by the Visigoths after Alaric had been killed in battle by the Franks. Alaric&#x27;s only legitimate son, Amalaric, was a child and too young to rule.

Initially Gesalec was supported by the powerful Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, but this support eventually faded. Between 508 and 511, he had one important Visigothic noble executed - Goiaric. Gesalec&#x27;s rule was dealt a decisive blow when the Burgundians, led by their king Gundobad, captured and plundered Narbonne, his capital. Gesalec fled to Barcelona, where he remained until Theodoric deposed him. Theodoric took over the rule of the Visigothic kingdom for the next 15 years, collecting its taxes and appointing its officials, ostensibly in the name of Gesalic&#x27;s half-brother, Amalaric, until he was old enough to rule.

Driven from the throne, Gesalec found a refuge in Carthage from the Vandal king Thrasamund. The Vandal king supported his cause, providing him money but no men, and in 510 and 511 the Vandal navy supported Gesalec&#x27;s invasion of Spain. However, after receiving some stern letters from Theodoric, Thrasamund recognized he was no match for the Ostrogoths and withdrew his support for Gesalec, offering an apology and gold to Theodoric.

Abandoned by Thrasamund, Gesalec fled to Aquitania, where he remained for a year. Herwig Wolfram notes that although Aquitania had been conquered by the Franks following the Battle of Vouille, it was still thickly populated by Visigoths and pro-Gothic Romans. Gesalec returned once again to Spain, and was defeated by Theodoric&#x27;s general Ibbas outside of Barcelona, according to Isidore of Seville at the twelfth milestone. Although he escaped from the battlefield, Gesalec was captured after crossing the river Durance and subsequently executed. Wolfram explains that Gesalec had played &quot;his last card, the Burgundians&quot;, but in a footnote observes &quot;Isidore does not tell us whether Burgundians or Ostrogothic guards captured and killed the luckless Visigothic king.&quot; Peter Heather speculates his execution was &quot;probably in 513.&quot;

<text>Charles Harold Herford, FBA (18 February 1853 â 25 April 1931) was an English literary scholar and critic. He is remembered principally for his biography and edition of the works of Ben Jonson in 11 volumes. This major scholarly project was published from 1925 onwards by Oxford University Press, and completed with Percy and Evelyn Simpson. It took half a century, being agreed on in 1902.

==Life==
He was born in Manchester, and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1875, graduating B.A. in 1879, M.A. in 1883. He was Professor at University College of Wales, Aberystwyth from 1887 to 1901, and Professor of English Literature at Victoria University of Manchester from 1901 to 1921.

His son Siegfried Herford, a successful mountain climber and aeronautical researcher, was killed in combat in World War I.

C. H. Herford died in Oxford on 25 April 1931.

<text>A KVM switch (with KVM being an abbreviation for &quot;keyboard, video, and mouse&quot;) is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from one or more sets of keyboards, video monitors, and mouse.

== Name ==
Switches to connect multiple computers to one or more peripherals have had multiple names.

The earliest name was Keyboard Video Switch (KVS). With the advent of the mouse, the Keyboard, Video and Mouse (KVM) switch became popular. The name was introduced by Remigius Shatas, the founder of Cybex (now Vertiv), a peripheral switch manufacturer, in 1995. Some companies call their switches Keyboard, Video, Mouse and Peripheral (KVMP).

== Types ==
USB keyboards, mice, and I/O devices are the most common devices connected to a KVM switch. The classes of KVM switches discussed below are based on different types of core technologies, which vary in how the KVM switch handles USB I/O devicesâincluding keyboards, mice, touchscreen displays, etc. (USB-HID = USB Human Interface Device)

; USB Hub Based KVM:Also called an &quot;Enumerated KVM switch&quot; or &quot;USB switch selector&quot;, a connected/shared USB device must go through the full initiation process (USB enumeration) every time the KVM is switched to another target system/port. The switching to different ports is similar to the process of physically plugging and unplugging a USB device into the targeted system.
; Emulated USB KVM: Dedicated USB console port(s) are assigned to emulate special sets of USB keyboard or mouse switching control information to each connected/targeted system. Emulated USB provides an instantaneous and reliable switching action that makes keyboard hotkeys and mouse switching possible. However, this class of KVM switch only uses generic emulations and consequently has only been able to support the most basic keyboard and mouse features. There are also USB KVM devices that allow cross-platform operating systems and basic keyboard and mouse sharing. 
; Semi-DDM USB KVM: Dedicated USB console port(s) work with all USB-HID (including keyboard and mouse), but do not maintain the connected devices&#x27; presence to all of the targeted systems simultaneously. This class of KVM takes advantage of DDM (Dynamic Device Mapping) technology.
; DDM USB KVM: Dedicated Dynamic device mapping USB console port(s) work with all USB-HID (including keyboard and mouse) and maintain the connected devices&#x27; special functions and characteristics to each connected/targeted system. This class of KVM switch overcomes the frustrating limitations of an Emulated USB Class KVM by emulating the true characters of the connected devices to all the computers simultaneously. This means that you can now use the extra function keys, wheels, buttons, and controls that are commonly found on modern keyboards and mice.
; KVM+Dock: A KVM switch with built-in docking station. It combines two devices, a KVM switch and a docking station. The customer expectations for this kind of product has increased due to a rising number of work from home setups that need to share user I/O devices between a personal PC and work laptop as a consequence of COVID pandemic restrictions.
;Limited*:supported, but does not allow USB re-enumeration, which not only causes long delays in switching, but also sometimes causes HPD (Hot-Plug Device) errors to the OS system(s).

;Yes*:Latency time within 1 second while switching between channels/ports.

; KVM+Dock: Dual DP1.4 KVM switch with TB4 dock model will be the first model released for full-buss DisplayPort 1.4 sharing for 4K144hz gaming monitors.

== Use ==

A KVM Switch is a hardware device used in data centers that allows the control of multiple computers from a single keyboard, monitor and mouse (KVM). The switch allows data center personnel to connect to any server in the rack. A common example of home use is to enable the use of the full-size keyboard, mouse and monitor of the home PC with a portable device such as a laptop, tablet PC or PDA, or a computer using a different operating system.

KVM switches offer different methods of connecting the computers. Depending on the product, the switch may present native connectors on the device where standard keyboard, monitor and mouse cables can be attached. Another method to have a single DB25 or similar connector that aggregated connections at the switch with three independent keyboard, monitor and mouse cables to the computers. Subsequently, these were replaced by a special KVM cable which combined the keyboard, video and mouse cables in a single wrapped extension cable. The advantage of the last approach is in the reduction of the number of cables between the KVM switch and connected computers. The disadvantage is the cost of these cables.

The method of switching from one computer to another depends on the switch. The original peripheral switches (Rose, circa 1988) used a rotary switch while active electronic switches (Cybex, circa 1990) used push buttons on the KVM device. In both cases, the KVM aligns operation between different computers and the users&#x27; keyboard, monitor and mouse (user console).

In 1992â1993, Cybex Corporation engineered keyboard hot-key commands. Today, most KVMs are controlled through non-invasive hot-key commands (e.g. , and the keys). Hot-key switching is often complemented with an on-screen display system that displays a list of connected computers.

KVM switches differ in the number of computers that can be connected. Traditional switching configurations range from 2 to 64 possible computers attached to a single device. Enterprise-grade devices interconnected via daisy-chained and/or cascaded methods can support a total of 512 computers equally accessed by any given user console.

==Video bandwidth==

While HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI switches have been manufactured, VGA is still the most common video connector found with KVM switches for industrial applications and manufacturing applications, although many switches are now compatible with HDMI and DisplayPort connectors. Analogue switches can be built with varying capacities for video bandwidth, affecting the unit&#x27;s overall cost and quality. A typical consumer-grade switch provides up to 200Â MHz bandwidth, allowing for high-definition resolutions at 60Â Hz.

For analog video, resolution and refresh rate are the primary factors in determining the amount of bandwidth needed for the signal. The method of converting these factors into bandwidth requirements is a point of ambiguity, in part because it is dependent on the analogue nature and state of the hardware. The same piece of equipment may require more bandwidth as it ages due to increased degradation of the source signal. Most conversion formulas attempt to approximate the amount of bandwidth needed, including a margin of safety. As a rule of thumb, switch circuitry should provide up to three times the bandwidth required by the original signal specification, as this allows most instances of signal loss to be contained outside the range of the signal that is pertinent to picture quality.

As CRT-based displays are dependent on refresh rate to prevent flickering, they generally require more bandwidth than comparable flat panel displays.
High-resolution and High-refresh-rate monitors become standard setups for advanced high-end KVM switches (specially with Gaming PC). 

* 2023: the highest resolutions and refresh-rate supported by Advanced DDM-class DisplayPort 1.4 KVM switch at 4K144hz, 5K120/240hz, 8K60hz (w/DSC) 

==Monitor==

A monitor uses DDC and EDID, transmitted through specific pins, to identify itself to the system. KVM switches may have different ways of handling these data transmissions:
* None: the KVM switch lacks the circuitry to handle this data, and the monitor is not &quot;visible&quot; to the system. The system may assume a generic monitor is attached and defaults to safe settings. Higher resolutions and refresh rates may need to be manually unlocked through the video driver as a safety precaution. However, certain applications (especially games) that depend on retrieving DDC/EDID information will not be able to function correctly.
* Fake: the KVM switch generates its own DDC/EDID information that may or may not be appropriate for the monitor that is attached. Problems may arise if there is an inconsistency between the KVM&#x27;s specifications and the monitor&#x27;s, such as not being able to select desired resolutions.
* Pass-through: the KVM switch attempts to make communication between the monitor and the system transparent. However, it may fail to do so in the following ways:
** generating Hot Plug Detect (HPD) events for monitor arrival or removal upon switching, or not passing monitor power states - may cause the OS to re-detect the monitor and reset the resolution and refresh rate, or may cause the monitor to enter or exit power-saving mode;
** not passing or altering MCSS commands - may result in incorrect orientation of the display or improper color calibration.

Microsoft guidelines recommend that KVM switches pass unaltered any I2C traffic between the monitor and the PC hosts, and do not generate HPD events upon switching to a different port while maintaining stable non-noise signal on inactive ports.

; Monitors with built-in KVM switch functions : More monitors had been included a built-in KVM switch to be able to have two computer systems (two upstream system connections) to share the monitor. However, since most of current monitors with KVM switch functions had been putting the only hub-class KVM switch with them. There is no HID emulation or no EDID emulation/feeding to all connected systems. In addition, they&#x27;re limited to having 2 systems connected to it. And only can control one monitor (the monitor itself only) with the built-in KVM switch. The built-in KVM switch CAN not support multi-monitor switching and control via it. 

== Passive and active (electronic) switches ==


KVM switches were originally passive, mechanical devices based on multi-pole switches and some of the cheapest devices on the market still use this technology. Mechanical switches usually have a rotary knob to select between computers. KVMs typically allow sharing of two or four computers, with a practical limit of about twelve machines imposed by limitations on available switch configurations. Modern hardware designs use active electronics rather than physical switch contacts with the potential to control many computers on a common system backbone.

One limitation of mechanical KVM switches is that any computer not currently selected by the KVM switch does not &#x27;see&#x27; a keyboard or mouse connected to it. In normal operation this is not a problem, but while the machine is booting up it will attempt to detect its keyboard and mouse and either fail to boot or boot with an unwanted (e.g. mouseless) configuration. Likewise, a failure to detect the monitor may result in the computer falling back to a low resolution such as (typically) 640x480. Thus, mechanical KVM switches may be unsuitable for controlling machines which can reboot automatically (e.g. after a power failure).

Another problem encountered with mechanical devices is the failure of one or more switch contacts to make firm, low resistance electrical connections, often necessitating some wiggling or adjustment of the knob to correct patchy colors on screen or unreliable peripheral response. Gold-plated contacts improve that aspect of switch performance, but add cost to the device.

Most active (electronic rather than mechanical) KVM devices provide peripheral emulation, sending signals to the computers that are not currently selected to simulate a keyboard, mouse and monitor being connected. These are used to control machines which may reboot in unattended operation. Peripheral emulation services embedded in the hardware also provides continuous support where computers require constant communication with the peripherals.

Some types of active KVM switches do not emit signals that exactly match the physical keyboard, monitor, and mouse, which can result in unwanted behavior of the controlled machines. For example, the user of a multimedia keyboard connected to a KVM switch may find that the keyboard&#x27;s multimedia keys have no effect on the controlled computers.

== Software alternatives ==
There are software alternatives to some of the functionality of a hardware KVM switch, such as Multiplicity, Synergy, and Barrier, which does the switching in software and forwards input over standard network connections. This has the advantage of reducing the number of wires needed. Screen-edge switching allows the mouse to function over both monitors of two computers.

==Remote KVM extenders==

There are two types of remote KVM extenders that are best described as local remote and KVM over IP.

===Local remote (including KVM over USB)===
Local remote KVM extender design allows users to control computer equipment up to away from the user consoles (keyboard, monitor and mouse). They require a direct cable connection from the computer to the KVM extender to the console and include support for standard category 5 cabling between computers and users interconnected by the extender. In contrast, USB powered KVM extenders are able to control computer equipment using a combination of USB, keyboard, mouse and monitor cables of up to .

===KVM over IP (IPKVM)===
KVM switch over IP extenders use a dedicated micro-controller and potentially specialized video capture hardware to capture the video, keyboard, and mouse signals, compress and convert them into packets, and send them over an Ethernet link to a remote console application that unpacks and reconstitutes the dynamic graphical image. KVM over IP subsystem is typically connected to a system&#x27;s standby power plane so that it&#x27;s available during the entire BIOS boot process.
These extender devices allow multiple computers to be controlled locally or globally with the use of an IP connection. There are performance issues related with LAN/WAN hardware, standard protocols and network latency so user management is commonly referred to as &quot;near real time&quot;.

Access to most remote or &quot;KVM&quot; over IP extenders today use a web browser, although many of the stand-alone viewer software applications provided by many manufacturers are also reliant on ActiveX or Java.

====Whitelisting====

Some KVM chipsets or manufacturers require the &quot;whitelisting&quot; or authority to connect to be implicitly enabled. Without the whitelist addition, the device will not work. This is by design and required to connect non-standard USB devices to KVM extenders. This is completed by noting the device&#x27;s ID (usually copied from the Device manager in Windows), or documentation from the manufacturer of the USB device.

Generally all HID or consumer grade USB peripherals are exempt, but more exotic devices like tablets, or digitisers or USB toggles require manual addition to the white list table of the KVM.

====Implementation====

In comparison to conventional methods of remote administration (for example in-band Virtual Network Computing or Terminal Services), a KVM switch has the advantage that it doesn&#x27;t depend on a software component running on the remote computer, thus allowing remote interaction with base level BIOS settings and monitoring of the entire booting process before, during, and after the operating system loads. Modern KVM over IP appliances or switches typically use at least 128-bit data encryption securing the KVM configuration over a WAN or LAN (using SSL).

KVM over IP extenders can be implemented in different ways. With regards to video, PCI KVM over IP cards use a form of screen scraping where the PCI bus master KVM over IP card would access and copy out the screen directly from the graphics memory buffer, and as a result it must know which graphics chip it is working with, and what graphics mode this chip is currently in so that the contents of the buffer can be interpreted correctly as picture data. Newer techniques in OPMA management subsystem cards and other implementations get the video data directly using the DVI bus. Implementations can emulate either PS/2 or USB based keyboards and mice. An embedded VNC server is typically used for the video protocol in IPMI and Intel AMT implementations.

== Computer sharing devices ==
KVM switches are called KVM sharing devices because two or more computers can share a single set of KVM peripherals. Computer sharing devices function in reverse compared to KVM switches; that is, a single PC can be shared by multiple monitors, keyboards, and mice. A computer sharing device is sometimes referred to as a KVM Splitter or reverse KVM switch. While not as common, this configuration is useful when the operator wants to access a single computer from two or more (usually close) locations - for example, a public kiosk machine that also has a staff maintenance interface behind the counter, or a home office computer that doubles as a home theater PC.

<text>Porter is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Moon, and lies across the northeastern rim of the huge walled plain Clavius. Although generally circular, the form of this crater has been modified by the geometry of the surface on which it was formed. The outer rim is generally lower to the southwest, where it lies on the floor of Clavius. Likewise the interior floor is flatter near this face. In contrast the northeastern floor is rougher and more uneven in the northeastern half.

The crater is somewhat worn in appearance, in comparison with the younger and sharper-edged Rutherfurd to the south along the southeastern rim of Clavius. There is a double central peak located just to the southwest of the midpoint. A small craterlet lies along the northwestern inner wall of the crater, but the formation is not otherwise significantly marked by smaller impacts.

This crater was formerly designated Clavius B before being renamed by the IAU.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Porter.

<doc id="1153926" wikidata="Q5361498" url="?curid=1153926" title="HPE Integrity Servers">
<text>HPE Integrity Servers is a series of server computers produced by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard) since 2003, based on the Itanium processor. The Integrity brand name was inherited by HP from Tandem Computers via Compaq.

In 2015, HP released the Superdome X line of Integrity Servers based on the x86 Architecture. It is a &#x27;small&#x27; Box holding up to 8 dual Socket Blades and supporting up to 16 processors/240 cores (when populated with Intel Xeon E7-2890 or E7-2880 Processors).

==General==
Over the years, Integrity systems have supported Windows Server, HP-UX 11i, OpenVMS, NonStop, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating systems on Integrity servers. As of 2020, the operating systems that are supported are HP-UX 11i, OpenVMS and NonStop.

Early Integrity servers were based on two closely related chipsets. The zx1 chipset supported up to 4 CPUs and up to 8 PCI-X busses. They consisted of three distinct application-specific integrated circuits; a memory and I/O controller, a scalable memory adapter and an I/O adapter. The PA-8800 and PA-8900 microprocessors use the same bus as the Itanium 2 processors, allowing HP to also use this chipset for the HP 9000 servers and C8000 workstations.

The memory and I/O controller can be attached directly to up to 12 DDR SDRAM slots. If more slots than this are needed, two scalable memory adapters can be attached instead, allowing up to 48 memory slots. The chipset supports DIMM sizes up to 4 GB, theoretically allowing a machine to support up to 192 GB of RAM, although the largest supported configuration was 128 GB.

The sx1000 chipset supported up to 64 CPUs and up to 192 PCI-X buses. The successor chipsets were the zx2 and sx2000 respectively.

==Mid-range servers==
HP&#x27;s mid-range and high-end (Superdome) servers are based on &quot;cell boards&quot;, sometimes called &quot;cells&quot;, which contain the chipset, Processors, memory, and I/O bus. This design allows the servers to be divided into &quot;hardware partitions&quot;, or groups of cell boards. Each partition is able to perform as if it were a separate server.

===rx7600 series===

The 10U rx7620 is based on the SX1000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs.
The 10U rx7640 is based on the SX2000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs.

* Maximum of 2 cell boards
* 4 CPU sockets per cell board
* 16 DIMM slots per cell board
* Maximum of 4 SCSI disks and 2 tape and/or CD/DVD-ROM internally (half to each cell board)
* 7 hot-pluggable I/O slots per cell board plus 1 core I/O slot per cell board for SX1000

The rx7600 series are the smallest cell-based servers from HP. Just like the bigger rx8600 (see below) and the HP Superdome (see below), these servers can be partitioned, either as one big partition (two cells in one partition) or as two independent cells.

===rx8600 series===

The 17U rx8620 is based on the SX1000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs.
The 17U rx8640 is based on the SX2000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs.

* The rx8620 was announced in 2003, along with the rx4640 and rx7620
* Maximum of four cell boards
* Four CPU sockets per cell board
* 16 DIMM slots per cell board
* Maximum of four SCSI disks and two tape and/or CD/DVD-ROM internally (half to cell board 0, half to cell board 1)
* Eight hot-pluggable I/O-slots per cell board and 1 core I/O slot per cell board for SX1000

Just like the smaller rx7600 (see above) and the HP Superdome (see below), the rx8600 can be partitioned using any combination of the four available cell boards (minimum of one, maximum of four separated partitions).

The maximum number of partitions is four when used with an I/O-expander unit. Because each partition requires an available I/O slot, and the rx8600 series&#x27; integrated I/O-chassis statically maps its two I/O slots to cell board 0 and 1, an rx8600 series system is limited to two partitions unless an IOX is installed.

Cells can be freely moved from a rx7600 series to a rx8600 series as long as the chipset is the same on the cells, and the firmware is compatible.

==High-end servers==
===Superdome===
The Superdome server is available in several models, including the SD-16, SD-32, and SD-64. HP announced Superdome 2 in April 2010, offering resiliency improvements, a modular, bladed design, common components and crossbar fabric that routes transactions to the optimal pathway between blades and I/O. Superdome 2 addresses requirements for high-performance computing by providing flexible scalability and fault tolerance necessary for mission-critical workloads.

In November 2011 HP announced Project Odyssey, a development roadmap to unify server architectures on a single platform. The roadmap includes blades with Intel Xeon processors for the HP Superdome 2 enclosure (code-named &quot;DragonHawk&quot;) and the scalable c-Class blade enclosures (code-named &quot;HydraLynx&quot;), while supporting Windows and Linux environments with features from HP-UX within the next two years.

<text>R v Glad Day Bookshops Inc, (2004) is a leading Ontario Superior Court of Justice decision on pornography and homosexuality. The court found that a statutory scheme requiring the approval of the Ontario Film Review Board before films can be distributed or shown in Ontario violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

==Background==
&quot;Bad Attitude&quot; is a lesbian magazine featuring stories of mild sado-masochism; it is published in the United States. In 1993 the magazine was the first publication to fall foul of feminist-inspired pornography laws in Canada.

According to the court&#x27;s description, the magazine

:&quot; consists of a series of articles where the writers fantasize about lesbian sexual encounters with a sadomasochistic theme. Photographs loosely complement some of the articles&quot;.

A story in the magazine featuring a lesbian stalking, ambushing and pleasuring another woman was found to be obscene, and the Glad Day Bookshop, which sold the investigating officer her copy, was fined C$200.

==Significance==

The case was symbolic for pornography advocates, who at the time were trying to demonstrate that the arguments of anti-porn feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin were antithetical to women&#x27;s interests. MacKinnon and Dworkin had provided arguments for new obscenity law in Canada; in this case the law disproportionately limited the voices of gay and lesbian writers, and even led to the impounding of two titles written by Dworkin.
