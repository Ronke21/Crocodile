<text>The Canadian Locomotive Company, commonly referred to as CLC, was a Canadian manufacturer of railway locomotives in Kingston, Ontario. Its works were on the south side of Ontario Street between William and Gore streets on Kingston&#x27;s waterfront.

==Early beginnings and bankruptcies==
The CLC had its beginnings with a number of predecessor businesses. It began business as the &quot;Ontario Foundry&quot; in 1848, but after commencing construction of locomotives it became known as the &quot;Kingston Locomotive Works&quot;. The first steam locomotive was turned out on Wednesday, December 20, 1854. This was the first of four locomotives for the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, which was being built at that time. A further order of five locomotives for the GTR followed in October and November 1856. However, less than three dozen locomotives were built before the business went bankrupt in 1860.

The &quot;Canadian Engine &amp; Machinery Company&quot; was a shareholder-owned successor company founded in 1865. It too ran into financial troubles during the depression of 1878–1879 and also went bankrupt. It was re-organized in February 1878 as the &quot;Canadian Locomotive and Engine Company Ltd.&quot; (CL&amp;EC). After yet another re-organization in April 1881, the plant was updated and expanded. The syndicate of investors who owned the Canadian Pacific Railway also owned a large portion of the CL&amp;EC, and when funds were needed to further work on the CPR, their shares were sold to the respected locomotive builder Dübs and Company, of Glasgow, Scotland, which eventually gained control effective January 1, 1888. CL&amp;EC became a major supplier to the CPR, delivering nearly one-third of their locomotives over many decades. These &quot;Dübs-boilered&quot; locomotives were regarded as durable and long-lasting.

==CLC is formed and finds modest success==
In January 1900, following the decision of both the CPR and the GTR to build their own locomotives, the CL&amp;EC once again became insolvent, and the plant was closed. It was bought by new investors and incorporated in February 1901 as the &quot;Canadian Locomotive Company Ltd.&quot; Improvements followed which allowed production of one locomotive per week. Reorganization once again took place under new management in June 1911 although the name remained the same.

CLC contributed to the war effort in two world wars by manufacturing armaments and munitions, as did the competing shops of the Montreal Locomotive Works, the CPR, and others. Large numbers of locomotives were also built for the war effort and for reconstruction afterwards.

By the end of World War II steam technology was at its peak, but production was declining except for exports to France, Belgium and India. One of the last groups of steam locomotives, completed in 1955, was 120 broad gauge, streamlined 4-6-2 types for passenger service in India. CLC felt its future lay with diesel locomotives, but lacking expertise it sought out opportunities with existing builders in the United States.
==Representing American manufacturers==

In 1948 CLC became the Canadian representative for Baldwin Locomotive Works which also owned Whitcomb Locomotive Works. However, the result of this collaboration was less than outstanding — the Whitcomb locomotives built for the Canadian National Railway with Sterling diesel engines proved problematic, and orders for Baldwin-designed locomotives were modest. CLC then turned to Fairbanks-Morse, a manufacturer of opposed piston diesel engines primarily used in maritime applications that was itself attempting to break into the railway locomotive market. Baldwin&#x27;s shares in CLC were acquired in 1950 by the newly formed Canadian Fairbanks Morse. Orders were more extensive and longer-lasting, especially for the Train Master and Consolidated line designs. However, the Fairbanks-Morse designs proved to be no match in the marketplace for the ALCO-designed locomotives offered by the Montreal Locomotive Works or to the Electro-Motive Division-designs constructed by General Motors Diesel. By 1957, orders had fallen off and Fairbanks-Morse eventually left the locomotive business in both Canada and the United States. Following the departure of Baldwin and MLW, the Canadian market was left to just two companies, General Electric and General Motors Diesel.

Before this however, CLC also sought more opportunities in the export market with the involvement of government agencies, exporting small industrial locomotives of Davenport-Besler design. In 1955 CLC bought the Davenport-Besler Corp. Inc., including its inventory of Porter locomotives. A Canadian-only DTC (Diesel Torque Converter) was built for the CPR featuring a diesel-hydraulic design rather than the conventional diesel-electric.

On July 26, 1965, CLC became &quot;Fairbanks-Morse (Canada) Ltd.&quot; and was no longer an independent Canadian company. Locomotive construction dwindled even further as the company branched out into industrial machinery such as marine engines and weigh scales. None of this could save the company.

==End of CLC==
Declining business and a union strike in April 1969 closed the plant that June. It was demolished in August 1971 after having constructed over 3000 locomotives from its earliest beginnings, making it at the time, Canada&#x27;s second largest commercial builder after Montreal Locomotive Works.

The site of the old plant (known as &quot;Block D&quot;) sat vacant for 35 years while several proposed developments failed to materialize or obtain municipal approval. It would be the last vacated portion of Ontario Street&#x27;s formerly industrial waterfront to be developed. After work to negate the effects of a century of industrial pollutants in the soil, it has recently been redeveloped with three high-rise apartment/condominium buildings (Locomotive Apartments, Carruthers Wharf, and Royal George), a high-rise hotel (Marriott Residences Inn), and a small municipal park (Battery Park).

<text>The National Security Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-governmental, non-profit research and archival institution located on the campus of the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1985 to check rising government secrecy, the National Security Archive is an investigative journalism center, open government advocate, international affairs research institute, and the largest repository of declassified U.S. documents outside the federal government. In the four decades of its history, the National Security Archive has spurred the declassification of more than 15 million pages of government documents by being the leading non-profit user of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), filing a total of more than 70,000 FOIA and declassification requests.

==Organization history and accolades==

Led by founder Scott Armstrong, former Washington Post Reporter and staff on the Senate Watergate Committee, journalists and historians came together to create the National Security Archive in 1985 with the idea of enriching research and public debate about national security policy. Directed by Tom Blanton since 1992, the National Security Archive continues to challenge national security secrecy by advocating for open government, utilizing the FOIA to compel the release of previously secret government documents, and analyzing and publishing its collections for the public.

As a prolific FOIA requester, the National Security Archive has obtained a host of seminal government documents, including: the documents behind the most requested still image photograph at the U.S. National Archives – a December 21, 1970 picture of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s meeting with Elvis Presley; the CIA&#x27;s &quot;Family Jewels&quot; list that documents decades of the agency&#x27;s illegal activities; the National Security Agency&#x27;s (NSA) description of its watch list of 1,600 Americans that included notable Americans such as civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., boxer Muhammad Ali, and politicians Frank Church and Howard Baker; the first official CIA confirmation of Area 51; U.S. plans for a &quot;full nuclear response&quot; in the event the President was ever attacked or disappeared; FBI transcripts of 25 interviews with Saddam Hussein after his capture by U.S. troops in December 2003; the Osama bin Laden File, and the most comprehensive document collections available on the Cold War, including the nuclear flashpoints occurring during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1983 &quot;Able Archer&quot; War Scare.

In 1998, the National Security Archive shared the George Foster Peabody Award for the outstanding broadcast series, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Cold War&quot;. In 1999, the National Security Archive won the George Polk Award, for, in the words of the citation, &quot;facilitating thousands of searches for journalists and scholars. The archive, funded by foundations as well as income from its own publications, has become a one-stop institution for declassifying and retrieving important documents, suing to preserve such government data as presidential e-mail messages, pressing for appropriate reclassification of files, and sponsoring research that has unearthed major revelations.&quot; 

In September 2005, the Archive won the Emmy Award for outstanding achievement in news and documentary research. In 2005, Forbes Best of the Web stated that the Archives is &quot;singlehandedly keeping bureaucrats’ feet to the fire on the Freedom of Information Act.&quot; In 2007, the Archive was named one of the &quot;Top 300 web sites for Political Science,&quot; by the International Political Science Association. In February 2011, the National Security Archive won Tufts University&#x27;s Dr. Jean Mayer Global Citizenship Award for &quot;demystifying and exposing the underworld of global diplomacy and supporting the public&#x27;s right to know.&quot; 

From 2003–2014, the Archive received 54 citations from the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Internet Scout Report recognizing &quot;the most valuable and authoritative resources online.&quot; In 2018, the Association of College and Research Libraries&#x27; Choice magazine named the Digital National Security Archive one of the &quot;Outstanding Academic Titles.&quot; In 2021, journalist Craig Whitlock of the Washington Post wrote, &quot;The National Security Archive provides an irreplaceable public service by prying loose records from federal agencies that prefer to operate in the dark.&quot;

==Funding==
The National Security Archive relies on publication revenues, grants from individuals and grants from foundations such as the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations, for its $3 million yearly budget. The National Security Archive receives no government funding. Incorporated as an independent Washington, D.C. non-profit organization, the National Security Archive is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt public charity.

==Program areas==

The National Security Archive operates eight program areas, each with dedicated funding. The National Security Archive&#x27;s (1) open government and accountability program receives support from the Open Society Foundations. The Archive&#x27;s (2) international freedom of information program in priority countries abroad and in the Open Government Partnership has been supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which also supports the Archive&#x27;s documentation work on cyber security (the Cyber Vault). The Archive&#x27;s (3) human rights evidence program, providing documentation for use by truth commissions and prosecutions, received funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the General Service Foundation. The Archive&#x27;s (4) Latin America program, with projects on Mexico, Chile, Cuba and other countries, is supported by the Ford Foundation, the Arca Foundation, and the Coyote Foundation. The Archive&#x27;s (5) nuclear weapons and intelligence documentation program, including the creation of the Nuclear Vault, has been supported by the Prospect Hill Foundation, the New-Land Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which also funds the Archive&#x27;s (6) Russia/former Soviet Union program. The National Security Archive has a Russian-language page publishing primary sources from Soviet and Russian archives that are no longer open in Moscow. The Archive&#x27;s (7) Iran program has been supported by the Arca Foundation and through a partnership with MIT Center for International Studies. The Archive&#x27;s (8) publications program, creating public access to declassified documents both online and in book formats, relies on publication royalties from libraries that subscribe to the Digital National Security Archive through the commercial publisher ProQuest.

==Publications==

The National Security Archive publishes its document collections in a variety of ways, including on its website, its blog Unredacted, documentary films, formal truth commission and court proceedings, and through the Digital National Security Archive, which contains over 61 digitized collections of more than 1,000,000 meticulously indexed documents, including the newly-available &#x27;Targeting Iraq, Part II: War and Occupation, 2002-2011&#x27; and &#x27;The Afghanistan War and the United States, 1998-2017,&#x27; published through ProQuest.

National Security Archive staff and fellows have authored some 100 books, including the winners of the 1996 Pulitzer Prize, the 1995 National Book Award, the 1996 Lionel Gelber Prize, the 1996 American Library Association&#x27;s James Madison Award Citation, a Boston Globe Notable Book selection for 1999, a Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2003, the 2010 Henry Adams Prize for outstanding major publication on the federal government&#x27;s history from the Society for History in the Federal Government, and the 2010 Link-Kuehl Prize from the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations.

The National Security Archive regularly publishes Electronic Briefing Books of newsworthy documents on major topics in international affairs on the Archive&#x27;s website, which attracts more than 2 million visitors each year who download more than 13.3 gigabytes per day. There are currently over 800 briefing books available.

The National Security Archive also frequently posts about declassification and news on its blog, Unredacted.

==Lawsuits==

The National Security Archive has participated in over 50 Freedom of Information lawsuits against the U.S. government. The suits have forced the declassification of documents ranging from the Kennedy-Khrushchev letters during the Cuban Missile Crisis to the previously censored photographs of homecoming ceremonies with flag-draped caskets for U.S. casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An Archive Freedom of Information lawsuit compelled the Pentagon to release the 15,000 Donald Rumsfeld &quot;snowflake&quot; memos covering his years as Secretary of Defense (2001-2006), providing essential evidence for the George Polk Award-winning series, &quot;The Afghanistan Papers,&quot; written by Craig Whitlock of the Washington Post. Another Archive lawsuit forced the State Department to declassify the memoranda, notes, and highest-level meeting transcripts recorded by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott during the Clinton administration, with a particular focus on U.S.-Russian relations in the first decade after the end of the Soviet Union.

The National Security Archive also brought and won seminal lawsuits regarding the preservation of White House e-mails and other electronic records. The original White House e-mail lawsuit, beginning in January 1989 with Armstrong v. Reagan and continuing against presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, established that e-mail had to be treated as government records, consequently leading to the preservation of more than 30 million White House e-mail messages from the 1980s and 1990s. The second White House e-mail lawsuit, filed in 2007 against the George W. Bush administration and settled by the Obama administration in 2009, achieved the recovery and preservation of more than 22 million White House e-mail messages that were deleted from White House computers between March 2003 and October 2005.

Cumulatively, the Archive&#x27;s litigation over the years to preserve White House e-records -- lawsuits brought together with a wide range of scholarly and public interest partners, and with the support of multiple pro bono law firms -- has resulted in the preservation of over a billion e-mails and e-messages, ranging from the IBM PROFs messages in the Reagan White House of the 1980s, to the WhatsApp messages in the Trump White House of 2020.

During the Trump years (2017-2021), the Archive brought a series of cases challenging record-keeping practices and the lack thereof at the White House. One of President Trump&#x27;s first actions on record-keeping was to suspend the routine publication of White House visitor logs kept by the Secret Service in vetting visitors and previously released online by the Obama White House some 90 days after the visit. In April 2017, the National Security Archive, with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), filed a FOIA lawsuit (Doyle v. DHS) against the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Secret Service, to compel continued release of the logs. Ultimately, a federal judge in New York and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump Administration had effectively converted those Secret Service agency records into presidential records not subject to FOIA.

The Archive together with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also brought suit against the Trump administration&#x27;s use of messaging applications that can automatically delete conversations or records of conversations. The suit, &quot;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington et al. v. Trump et al.&quot;, was filed on June 22, 2017. In March 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Christopher R. Cooper ruled that the act gives the president a &quot;substantial degree of discretion&quot; in deciding what should be preserved as a permanent record and it allows the president to destroy records that no longer have &quot;administrative, historical, informational or evidentiary value.&quot; The DC Circuit upheld the Cooper decision, although Circuit Judge David Tatel remarked in the decision that disappearing instant messages represented a technology &quot;that Richard Nixon could only dream of.&quot;

In December 2020, the Archive together with the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, the American Historical Association, and the public interest group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) brought a new lawsuit naming the White House and the National Archives as defendants and asking federal court for a temporary restraining order against any destruction of documents during the Trump-Biden transition. Justice Department lawyers assured then-District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson that a litigation hold as a result of the lawsuit covered all White House records so that a TRO was unnecessary; and after the Biden transition, the government informed Judge Jackson and the plaintiffs that all presidential records had been secured, including the WhatsApp messages generated by senior White House staff. Subsequently, the National Archives realized that many boxes of Trump records were missing, prominently including correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and began recovery measures that ultimately included an FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.

==Audits==

Since 2002, the Archive has carried out annual FOIA audits that are designed after the California Sunshine Survey. These FOIA audits evaluate whether government agencies are in compliance with open-government laws. The surveys include:

* The Ashcroft Memo: &quot;Drastic&quot; Change or &quot;More Thunder Than Lightning&quot;? 
* Justice Delayed is Justice Denied 
* A FOIA Request Celebrates Its 17th Birthday: A Report on Federal Agency FOIA Backlog 
* Pseudo-Secrets: A Freedom of Information Audit of the U.S. Government&#x27;s Policies on Sensitive Unclassified Information 
* File Not Found: 10 Years After E-FOIA, Most Federal Agencies are Delinquent 
* 40 Years of FOIA, 20 Years of Delay 
* Mixed Signals, Mixed Results: How President Bush&#x27;s Executive Order on FOIA Failed to Deliver 
* 2010 Knight Open Government Survey: Sunshine and Shadows 
* 2011 Knight Open Government Survey: Glass Half Full 
* 2011 Knight Open Government Survey: Eight Federal Agencies Have FOIA Requests a Decade Old 
* Outdated Agency Regs Undermine Freedom of Information.
* Half of Federal Agencies Still Use Outdated Freedom of Information Regulations 
* Most Agencies Falling Short on Mandate for Online Records 
* Saving Government Email an Open Question with December 2016 Deadline Looming 

==Rosemary Award==

Every year the National Security Archive nominates a government agency for the Rosemary Award for worst open government performance. The award is named after President Nixon&#x27;s secretary, Rose Mary Woods, who erased minutes of a crucial Watergate tape. Past &quot;winners&quot; include the Department of Justice, the Federal Chief Information Officer&#x27;s Council, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Air Force, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the Secret Service, the White House and the CIA.

== Conferences ==

The Archive has organized, sponsored, or co-sponsored a dozen major conferences. These include the historic conferences held in Havana in 2002 and in Budapest in 1996 respectively. For the Havana conference, which took place during the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban president Fidel Castro and former US secretary of defense Robert McNamara discussed newly declassified documents showing that US president John F. Kennedy, in meetings with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s son-in-law Adzhubei in January 1962, compared the US failure at the Bay of Pigs to the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. The Budapest conference of 1996, carried out by the Archive&#x27;s &quot;Openness in Russia and East Europe Project&quot; in collaboration with Cold War International History Project and Russian and Eastern European partners, focused on the 1956 uprising was a featured subject at an international conference which the Archive, CWIHP, and the Zentrum für Zeithistorische Forschung organized in Potsdam on &quot;The Crisis Year 1953 and the Cold War in Europe.&quot; Oxford University historian Timothy Garton Ash called the conference &quot;not ordinary at all... this dramatic confrontation of documents and memories, of written and oral history...&quot;

Other noteworthy conferences the National Security Archive took part in include a conference held in Hanoi in 1997, during which Defense Secretary Robert McNamara met with his Vietnamese counterpart, Gen. Võ Nguyên Giáp, and a series of conferences on U.S.-Iranian relations.

In December 2016 the Archive, with the Carnegie Corporation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and the Carnegie Endowment, hosted a conference on the 25th anniversary of the Nunn-Lugar nuclear threat reduction legislation, which helped secure post-Soviet nuclear weapons. The conference, attended by Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar as well as other Nunn-Lugar veterans including Russians, Kazakhs, and Americans, was held in the Kennedy Caucus Room of the U.S. Senate and discussed the future of mutual security and U.S.-Russian relations.

<doc id="1189653" wikidata="Q1230607" url="?curid=1189653" title="John Owen (epigrammatist)">
<text>John Owen (c. 15641622) was a Welsh epigrammatist, most known for his Latin epigrams, collected in his &quot;Epigrammata&quot;.

He is also cited by various Latinizations including Ioannes Owen, Joannes Oweni, Ovenus and Audoenus.

==Life, education, and career==
Owen was born at Plas Du, Llanarmon, Caernarfonshire (now Gwynedd), and was educated at Winchester College under Dr Thomas Bilson, and New College, Oxford, from where he graduated as Bachelor of Civil Law in 1590. 

He was a fellow of his college from 1584 to 1591, when he became a schoolmaster, first at Trelleck, near Monmouth, and then of The King&#x27;s School at Warwick around 1595. His salary was doubled to £20 per year in 1614. On his death in 1622, Owen was buried in the old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, memorialised with a Latin epitaph, thanks to his countryman and relative, Bishop John Williams of Lincoln, who is also said to have supported him in his later years.

==Epigrams==
Owen became distinguished for his perfect mastery of the Latin language, and for the humour, felicity and point of his epigrams. His Latin epigrams, which have both sense and wit in a high degree, gained him much applause, and were translated into English, French, German, and Spanish.

Owen had started writing epigrams while at Winchester – indeed, education there was largely devoted to the production of them – and his were good enough by the time he reached 16 years of age to be used in a ceremony held when Queen Elizabeth I paid a state visit to Sir Francis Drake on his ship at Deptford, on his return from sailing around the world.

Owen started publishing his epigrams in 1606, whereupon they met with almost instant success throughout Europe, and the Continental scholars and wits of the day used to call him &quot;the British Martial&quot;.

==&quot;Epigrammata&quot;==
Owen&#x27;s &quot;Epigrammata&quot; are divided into twelve books, of which the first three were published in 1606, and the rest at four different times (1607, 1612, c. 1613, 1620 ). Owen frequently adapts and alters to his own purpose the lines of his predecessors in Latin verse. His epigrams proved popular for centuries after his death, appearing in numerous reprints, editions and translations.

===Books===
The numbering of the books can be confusing. They were originally published as 10 books in 4 volumes, with books numbered from 1 in each volume. There are thus 4 books entitled &quot;Book I&quot;, distinguished by whom they were dedicated to. Later editions collected all volumes in one, numbering the books sequentially. Books XI and XII are later additions, in the 1620 Leipzig edition.

Book XI is a collection of 128 moralising epigrams, titled &quot;Monosticha Quaedam Ethica et Politica Veterum Sapientum,&quot; and are not due to Owen: they are from the &quot;Disticha de Moribus&quot; of Michel Verino.

Book XII is a collection of fragments by Owen.

The original 4 volumes are:
# &quot;Ioannis Audoeni Epigrammatum libri III,&quot; London, 1606 (dedicated to Lady Mary Neville, reprinted twice in 1607)
# &quot;Epigrammatum Ioannis Owen…liber singularis,&quot; London, 1607 (dedicated to Lady Arabella Stuart)
# &quot;Epigrammatum Ioannis Owen…Libri Tres,&quot; London, 1612 (the first two Books dedicated to Henry, Prince of Wales, the third Book dedicated to Charles, Duke of York)
# &quot;Epigrammatum Joannis Owen…libri Tres,&quot; London, 1613 (?) (three Books, dedicated respectively to Sir Edward Noel, Sir William Sedley, and Sir Roger Owen)

===&quot;Tempora mutantur&quot;===

The most popular of his epigrams is a variant of the traditional &quot;Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis&quot;. (&quot;Times change, and we change with them.&quot;) Owen&#x27;s version reads in full:

The popularity of his &quot;Epigrammata&quot; means that this adage is at times attributed to him, and Joseph Haydn likely nicknamed his Symphony No. 64 &quot;Tempora mutantur&quot; based on &quot;Epigrammata&quot;.

===Editions and translations===
There are editions of the &quot;Epigrammata&quot; by Elzevir and by Didot; the best is that edited by Renouard (2 vols., Paris, 1795).

Translations into English, either in whole or in part, were made by John Vicars in &quot;Epigrams of that most wittie and worthie epigrammatist Mr. Iohn Owen, Gentleman&quot; (1619); by Robert Hayman, whose book &quot;Quodlibets&quot;(1628) included epigrams by Owen; by Thomas Pecke, in his &quot;Parnassi Puerperium&quot; (1659); and by Thomas Harvey in &quot;The Latine epigrams of John Owen&quot; (1677), which is the most complete. La Torre, the Spanish epigrammatist, owed much to Owen, and translated his works into Spanish in 1674. French translations of the best of Owen&#x27;s epigrams were published by A. L. Lebrun (1709) and by Kerivalant (1819). &quot;Epic and Epigrams&quot; (1997) by David R. Slavitt contains translations of 60 of Owen&#x27;s epigrams.

===Conflict with the Roman Catholic Church===
He was a staunch Protestant, and could not resist the temptation of turning his wit against the Roman Catholic Church, which resulted in &quot;Epigrammata&quot; being placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; in 1654, and lead to his uncle Hugh Owen, a recusant involved in the Ridolfi plot, to cut him out of his will.

<text>Song structure is the arrangement of a song, and is a part of the songwriting process. It is typically sectional, which uses repeating forms in songs. Common piece-level musical forms for vocal music include bar form, 32-bar form, verse–chorus form, ternary form, strophic form, and the 12-bar blues. Popular music songs traditionally use the same music for each verse or stanza of lyrics (as opposed to songs that are &quot;through-composed&quot;—an approach used in classical music art songs). Pop and traditional forms can be used even with songs that have structural differences in melodies. The most common format in modern popular music is introduction (intro), verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and chorus, with an optional outro. In rock music styles, notably heavy metal music, there is usually one or more guitar solos in the song, often found after the middle chorus part. In pop music, there may be a guitar solo, or a solo performed with another instrument such as a synthesizer or a saxophone.

The foundation of popular music is the &quot;verse&quot; and &quot;chorus&quot; structure. Some writers use a simple &quot;verse, hook, verse, hook, bridge, hook&quot; method. Pop and rock songs nearly always have both a verse and a chorus. The primary difference between the two is that when the music of the verse returns, it is almost always given a new set of lyrics, whereas the chorus usually retains the same set of lyrics every time its music appears.&quot; Both are essential elements, with the verse usually played first (exceptions include &quot;She Loves You&quot; by The Beatles, an early example in the rock music genre). Each verse usually employs the same melody (possibly with some slight modifications), while the lyrics usually change for each verse. The chorus (or &quot;refrain&quot;) usually consists of a melodic and lyrical phrase that repeats. Pop songs may have an introduction and coda (&quot;tag&quot;), but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs often connect the verse and chorus via a pre-chorus, with a bridge section usually appearing after the second chorus.

The verse, chorus and pre-chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the intro, bridge, and coda (also called an &quot;outro&quot;) are usually only used once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section, one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues or jazz improvised.

==Verse–chorus form==

Verse–chorus form consists of two main sections – a verse and chorus – that often contrast melodically, rhythmically, harmonically and dynamically. Songs in verse–chorus form may also include introductory, transitional and concluding sections.

===Introduction===

The introduction is a unique section that comes at the beginning of the piece. Generally speaking, an introduction contains just music and no words. It usually builds up suspense for the listener so when the downbeat drops in, it creates a pleasing sense of release. The intro also creates the atmosphere of the song. As such, the rhythm section typically plays in the &quot;feel&quot; of the song that follows. For example, for a blues shuffle, a band starts playing a shuffle rhythm. In some songs, the intro is one or more bars of the tonic chord (the &quot;home&quot; key of the song). With songs, another role of the intro is to give the singer the key of the song. For this reason, even if an intro includes chords other than the tonic, it generally ends with a cadence, either on the tonic or dominant chord.

The introduction may also be based around the chords used in the verse, chorus, or bridge, or a stock &quot;turnaround&quot; progression may be played, such as the I–vi–ii–V progression (particularly in jazz influenced pop songs). More rarely, the introduction may begin by suggesting or implying another key. For example, a song in C Major might begin with an introduction in G Major, which makes the listener think that the song will eventually be in G Major. A cliche used to indicate to the listener that this G Major section is in fact the dominant chord of another key area is to add the dominant seventh, which in this case would shift the harmony to a G7 chord. In some cases, an introduction contains only drums or percussion parts that set the rhythm and &quot;groove&quot; for the song. Alternately the introduction may consist of a solo section sung by the lead singer (or a group of backup singers), or a riff played by an instrumentalist.

The most straightforward, and least risky way to write an introduction is to use a section from the song. This contains melodic themes from the song, chords from one of the song&#x27;s sections, and the beat and style of the song. However, not all songs have an intro of this type. Some songs have an intro that does not use any of the material from the song that is to follow. With this type of intro, the goal is to create interest in the listener and make them unsure of what will happen. This type of intro could consist of a series of loud, accented chords, punctuated by cymbal, with a bassline beginning near the end, to act as a pitch reference point for the singer.

===Verse===
In popular music, a verse roughly corresponds to a poetic &quot;stanza&quot; because it consists of rhyming lyrics most often with an AABB or ABAB rhyme scheme. When two or more sections of the song have almost identical music but different lyrics, each section is considered one verse.

Musically, &quot;the verse is to be understood as a unit that prolongs the tonic...The musical structure of the verse nearly always recurs at least once with a different set of lyrics.&quot; The tonic or &quot;home key&quot; chord of a song can be prolonged in a number of ways. Pop and rock songs often use chords closely related to the tonic, such as iii or vi, to prolong the tonic. In the key of C Major, the iii chord would be E Minor and the vi chord would be A Minor. These chords are considered closely related to the tonic because they share chord tones. For example, the chord E Minor includes the notes E and G, both of which are part of the C Major triad. Similarly, the chord A Minor includes the notes C and E, both part of the C Major triad.

Lyrically, &quot;the verse contains the details of the song: the story, the events, images and emotions that the writer wishes to express...Each verse will have different lyrics from the others.&quot; &quot;A verse exists primarily to support the chorus or refrain...both musically and lyrically.&quot; A verse of a song, is a repeated sung melody where the words change from use to use (though not necessarily a great deal).

===Pre-chorus===
An optional section that may occur after the verse is the pre-chorus. Also known as a &quot;build&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;, or &quot;transitional bridge&quot;, the pre-chorus functions to connect the verse to the chorus with intermediary material, typically using subdominant (usually built on the IV chord or ii chord, which in the key of C Major would be an F Major or D minor chord) or similar transitional harmonies. &quot;Often, a two-phrase verse containing basic chords is followed by a passage, often harmonically probing, that leads to the full chorus.&quot; Often, when verse and chorus use the same harmonic structure, the pre-chorus introduces a new harmonic pattern or harmony that prepares the verse chords to transition into the chorus.

For example, if a song is set in C Major, and the songwriter aims to get to a chorus that focuses on the dominant chord (G Major) being tonicized (treated like a &quot;home key&quot; for a short period), a chord progression could be used for the pre-chorus that gets the listener ready to hear the chorus&#x27; chord (G Major) as an arrival key. One widely used way to accomplish this is to precede the G Major chord with its own ii–V7 chords. In the key given, ii of G Major would be an A minor chord. V7 of G Major would be D7. As such, with the example song, this could be done by having a pre-chorus that consists of one bar of A minor and one bar of D7. This would allow the listener to expect a resolution from ii–V to I, which in this case is the temporary tonic of G Major. The chord A minor would not be unusual to the listener, as it is a shared chord that exists in both G Major and C Major. A minor is the ii chord in G Major, and it is the vi chord in C Major. The chord that would alert the listener that a change was taking place is the D7 chord. There is no D7 chord in C Major. A listener experienced with popular and traditional music would hear this as a secondary dominant. Harmonic theorists and arrangers would call it V7/V or &quot;five of five&quot;, as the D7 chord is the dominant (or fifth) chord of G Major.

===Chorus or refrain===

The terms &quot;chorus&quot; and &quot;refrain&quot; are often used interchangeably, both referring to a recurring part of a song. When a distinction is made, the chorus is the part that contains the hook or the &quot;main idea&quot; of a song&#x27;s lyrics and music, and there is rarely variation from one repetition of the chorus to the next. A refrain is a repetitive phrase or phrases that serve the function of a chorus lyrically, but are not in a separate section or long enough to be a chorus. For example, refrains are found in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot; (&quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot;), AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, and &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; (&quot;fa la la la la&quot;).

The chorus or refrain is the element of the song that repeats at least once both musically and lyrically. It is always of greater musical and emotional intensity than the verse. &quot;The chorus, which gets its name from a usual thickening of texture from the addition of backing vocals, is always a discrete section that nearly always prolongs the tonic and carries an unvaried poetic text.&quot; In terms of narrative, the chorus conveys the main message or theme of the song. Normally the most memorable element of the song for listeners, the chorus usually contains the hook.

===Post-chorus===

An optional section that may occur after the chorus is the post-chorus (or postchorus). The term can be used generically for any section that comes after a chorus, but more often refers to a section that has similar character to the chorus, but is distinguishable in close analysis. The concept of a post-chorus has been particularly popularized and analyzed by music theorist Asaf Peres, who is followed in this section.

Characterizations of post-chorus vary, but are broadly classed into simply a second chorus (in Peres&#x27;s terms, a &quot;detached postchorus&quot;) or an extension of the chorus (in Peres&#x27;s terms, an &quot;attached postchorus&quot;). Some restrict &quot;post-chorus&quot; to only cases where it is an extension of a chorus (attached postchorus), and do not consider the second part of two-part choruses (detached postchorus) as being a &quot;post&quot;-chorus.

As with distinguishing the pre-chorus from a verse, it can be difficult to distinguish the post-chorus from the chorus. In some cases they appear separately – for example, the post-chorus only appears after the second and third chorus, but not the first – and thus are clearly distinguishable. In other cases they always appear together, and thus a &quot;chorus + post-chorus&quot; can be considered a subdivision of the overall chorus, rather than an independent section.

Characterization of a post-chorus varies, beyond &quot;comes immediately after the chorus&quot;; Peres characterizes it by two conditions: it maintains or increases sonic energy, otherwise it is a bridge or verse; and contains a melodic hook (vocal or instrumental), otherwise it is a transition.

Detached post-choruses typically have distinct melody and lyrics from the chorus:
* &quot;Chandelier&quot; (Sia, 2014): the chorus begins and ends with &quot;I&#x27;m gonna swing from the chandelier / From the chandelier&quot;, while the post-chorus repeats instead &quot;holding on&quot;, in &quot;I&#x27;m holding on for dear life&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m just holding on for tonight&quot;, and has a new melody, but the same chord progression as the chorus.
* &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; (Thin Lizzy, 1976): the chorus consists of the phrase &quot;the boys are back in town&quot;, repeated in a call-and-response style, while the post-chorus features a prominent riff by two lead guitars.
* &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (Nirvana, 1991): the chorus lasts from &quot;With the lights out, it&#x27;s less dangerous&quot; to &quot;A mosquito, my libido&quot;, while the post-chorus features a heavy riff with the vocals &quot;hey, yay&quot;.

Lyrics of attached post-choruses typically repeat the hook/refrain from the chorus, with little additional content, often using vocables like &quot;ah&quot; or &quot;oh&quot;. Examples include:
* &quot;Umbrella&quot; (Rihanna, 2007): the chorus begins &quot;When the sun shine, we shine together&quot; and run through &quot;You can stand under my umbrella / You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh&quot;, which is followed by three more repetitions of &quot;Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh&quot;, the last one adding another &quot;eh, eh-eh&quot;. Here the division between chorus and post-chorus is blurred, as the &quot;ella, ella&quot; begins in the chorus, and was a play on the reverb effect.
* &quot;Shape of You&quot; (Ed Sheeran, 2017): the chorus runs &quot;I&#x27;m in love with the shape of you ... Every day discovering something brand new / I&#x27;m in love with your body&quot;, and the post-chorus repeats vocables and the hook &quot;Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I / I&#x27;m in love with your body&quot;, then repeats the end of the chorus, switching &quot;your body&quot; to &quot;the shape of you&quot;: &quot;Every day discovering something brand new / I&#x27;m in love with the shape of you&quot;
* &quot;Girls Like You&quot; (Maroon 5, 2018): the chorus runs &quot;&#x27;Cause girls like you ... I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah ... I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah&quot;, and the post-chorus repeats the hook with added &quot;yeah&quot;s: &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah / I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah / Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah / I need a girl like you&quot;.

Hybrids are also common (Peres: &quot;hybrid postchorus&quot;), where the post-chorus keeps the hook from the chorus (like an attached postchorus), but introduces some additional content (hook or melody, like a detached postchorus.

===Bridge===
A bridge may be a &quot;transition&quot;, but in popular music, it more often is &quot;...a section that contrasts with the verse...[,] usually ends on the dominant...[,] [and] often culminates in a strong re-transitional.&quot; &quot;The bridge is a device that is used to break up the repetitive pattern of the song and keep the listener&#x27;s attention...In a bridge, the pattern of the words and music change.&quot; For example, John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Country Roads&quot; is a song with a bridge while Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; is a song without one.

In music theory, &quot;middle eight&quot; (a common type of bridge) refers to a section of a song with a significantly different melody and lyrics, which helps the song develop itself in a natural way by creating a contrast to the previously played, usually placed after the second chorus in a song.

A song employing a middle eight might look like:
 Intro-{Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus}{Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus}-Middle 8-{Chorus}

By adding a powerful upbeat middle eight, musicians can then end the song with a hook in the end chorus and finale.

===Conclusion or outro===


The conclusion or (in popular-music terminology) outro of a song is a way of finishing or completing the song. It signals to the listeners that the song is nearing its close. The reason for having an outro is that if a song just ended at the last bar of a section, such as on the last verse or the last chorus, this might feel too abrupt for listeners. By using an outro, the songwriter signals that the song is, in fact, nearing its end. This gives the listeners a good sense of closure. For DJs, the outro is a signal that they need to be ready to mix in their next song.

In general, songwriters and arrangers do not introduce any new melodies or riffs in the outro. However, a melody or riff used throughout the song may be re-used as part of an outro. Generally, the outro is a section where the energy of the song, broadly defined, dissipates. For example, many songs end with a fade-out, in which the song gets quieter and quieter. In many songs, the band does a ritardando during the outro, a process of gradually slowing down the tempo. Both the fade-out and the ritardando are ways of decreasing the intensity of a song and signalling that it is nearing its conclusion.

For an outro that fades out, the arranger or songwriter typically repeats a short section of the music over and over. This can be the chorus, for example. An audio engineer then uses the fader on the mixing board to gradually decrease the volume of the recording. When a band, especially a tribute band, plays a cover song that, in the recorded version, ended with a fade-out, the live band might simulate that by playing progressively quieter. However, the live band will more likely invent an instrumental ending to definitively finish the song, which may be some standard closing cadence or perhaps a coda specifically patterned after the song&#x27;s refrain.

Besides fading out, another way some pop and rock songs may end is with a tag. There are two types of tags: the instrumental tag and the instrumental/vocal tag. With an instrumental tag, the vocalist no longer sings, and the band&#x27;s rhythm section takes over the music to finish off the song. A tag is often a vamp of a few chords that the band repeats. In a jazz song, this could be a standard turnaround, such as I–vi–ii–V7 or a stock progression, such as ii–V7. If the tag includes the tonic chord, such as a vamp on I–IV, the bandleader typically cues the last time that the penultimate chord (a IV chord in this case) is played, leading to an ending on the I chord. If the tag does not include the tonic chord, such as with a ii–V7 tag, the bandleader cues the band to do a cadence that resolves onto the tonic (I) chord. With an instrumental and vocal tag, the band and vocalist typically repeat a section of the song, such as the chorus, to give emphasis to its message. In some cases, the vocalist may use only a few words from the chorus or even one word. Some bands have the guitar player do a guitar solo during the outro, but it is not the focus of the section; instead, it is more to add interesting improvisation. A guitar solo during an outro is typically mixed lower than a mid-song guitar solo.

===Elision===

An elision is a section of music where different sections overlap one another, usually for a short period. It is mostly used in fast-paced music, and it is designed to create tension and drama. Songwriters use elision to keep the song from losing its energy during cadences, the points at which the music comes to rest on, typically on a tonic or dominant chord. If a song has a section that ends with a cadence on the tonic, if the songwriter gives this cadence a full bar, with the chord held as a whole note, this makes the listener feel like the music is stopping. However, if songwriters use an elided cadence, they can bring the section to a cadence on the tonic, and then, immediately after this cadence, begin a new section of music which overlaps with the cadence. Another form of elision would, in a chorus later in the song, to interject musical elements from the bridge.

===Instrumental solo===
A solo is a section designed to showcase an instrumentalist (e.g. a guitarist or a harmonica player) or less commonly, more than one instrumentalist (e.g., a trumpeter and a sax player). Guitar solos are common in rock music, particularly heavy metal and in the blues. The solo section may take place over the chords from the verse, chorus, or bridge, or over a standard solo backing progression, such as the 12-bar blues progression. In some pop songs, the solo performer plays the same melodies that were performed by the lead singer, often with flourishes and embellishments, such as riffs, scale runs, and arpeggios. In blues- or jazz-influenced pop songs, the solo performers may improvise a solo.

===Ad lib===
An &quot;ad lib&quot; section of a song (usually in the coda or outro) occurs when the main lead vocal or a second lead vocal breaks away from the already established lyric and/or melody to add melodic interest and intensity to the end of the song. Often, the ad lib repeats the previously sung line using variations on phrasing, melodic shape, and/or lyric, but the vocalist may also use entirely new lyrics or a lyric from an earlier section of the song. During an ad lib section, the rhythm may become freer (with the rhythm section following the vocalist), or the rhythm section may stop entirely, giving the vocalist the freedom to use whichever tempo sounds right. During live performances, singers sometimes include ad libs not originally in the song, such as making a reference to the town of the audience or customizing the lyrics to the current events of the era.

There is a distinction between ad lib as a song section and ad lib as a general term. Ad lib as a general term can be applied to any free interpretation of the musical material.

==AABA form==

Thirty-two-bar form uses four sections, most often eight measures long each (4×8=32), two verses or A sections, a contrasting B section (the bridge or &quot;middle-eight&quot;) and a return of the verse in one last A section (AABA). The B section is often intended as a contrast to the A sections that precede and follow it. The B section may be made to contrast by putting it in a new harmony. For example, with the jazz standard &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, the A sections are all tonic prolongations based around the I–vi–ii–V chord progression (B in the standard key); however, the B section changes key and moves to V/vi, or D7 in the standard key, which then does a circle of fifths movement to G7, C7 and finally F7, setting the listener up for a return to the tonic Bb in the final A section.

The &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; example also provides contrast because the harmonic rhythm changes in the B section. Whereas the A sections contain a vibrant, exciting feel of two chord changes per bar (e.g., the first two bars are often B–g minor/c minor–F7), the B section consists of two bars of D7, two bars of G7, two bars of C7 and two bars of F7. In some songs, the &quot;feel&quot; also changes in the B section. For example, the A sections may be in swing feel, and the B section may be in Latin or Afro-Cuban feel.

While the form is often described as AABA, this does not mean that the A sections are all exactly the same. The first A section ends by going back to the next A section, and the second A section ends and transitions into the B section. As such, at the minimum, the composer or arranger often modifies the harmony of the end of the different A sections to guide the listener through the key changes. As well, the composer or arranger may re-harmonize the melody on one or more of the A sections, to provide variety. Note that with a reharmonization, the melody does not usually change; only the chords played by the accompaniment musicians change.

Examples include &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;:
:A: Deck the hall with boughs of holly,
:A: &#x27;Tis the season to be jolly.
:B: Don we now our gay apparel,
:A: Troll the ancient Yuletide carol.

==Variation on the basic structure==
Verse-chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form, in compound AABA forms. That means that every A section or B section can consist of more than one section (for example Verse-Chorus). In that way the modern popular song structure can be viewed as a AABA form, where the B is the bridge.

AAA format may be found in Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, and songs like &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, and &quot;Clementine&quot;. Also &quot;Old MacDonald&quot;, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;, and Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;.

AABA may be found in Crystal Gayle&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;, Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot;.

ABA (verse/chorus or chorus/verse) format may be found in Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; (chorus first) and The Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot; (verse first).

ABAB may be found in AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot;, Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Margaritaville&quot;, The Archies&#x27;s &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, and The Eagles&#x27;s &quot;Hotel California&quot;.

ABABCB format may be found in John Cougar Mellencamp&#x27;s &quot;Hurts So Good&quot;, Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It?&quot;, and ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot;. Variations include Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;My Guy&quot;, The Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, The Pretenders&#x27; &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; (ABABCAB), Poison&#x27;s &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; (ABABCBAB), and Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot; (ABABCABCAB).

<text>The Masterkey is a door breaching shotgun system manufactured by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company.

The Masterkey project was initiated during the 1980s to provide assault rifles with a potent built-in door breaching tool. Individual soldiers were often forced to carry a breaching shotgun in addition to their standard-issue rifle, but the Masterkey removes this need. The system consists of a shortened Remington 870 12 gauge pump-action intended to be mounted under a firearm&#x27;s barrel, similarly to the M203 grenade launcher. It has a 3-round internal tubular magazine and can carry an additional round in the chamber, for a total of 4 rounds.

The shotgun can only be awkwardly operated independently because it has no grip behind the trigger—when firing the Masterkey, the rifle&#x27;s magazine must be used as a makeshift pistol grip. Independent stocks and grips for the 870 are available for use, but they are incompatible with the M16 barrel mount. KAC makes an independent stock for the Masterkey that also can be used with the M203 grenade launcher.

The Masterkey inspired the M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System, an attachable shotgun in use with the United States Army. The M26 was chosen by the Army over the Masterkey as a breaching tool.

The weapon is named &quot;Masterkey&quot; in reference to its ability to &quot;unlock&quot; virtually any standard lock.

<text>Zellweger syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the reduction or absence of functional peroxisomes in the cells of an individual. It is one of a family of disorders called Zellweger spectrum disorders which are leukodystrophies. Zellweger syndrome is named after Hans Zellweger (1909–1990), a Swiss-American pediatrician, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at the University of Iowa who researched this disorder.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Zellweger syndrome is one of three peroxisome biogenesis disorders that belong to the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD-ZSD). The other two disorders are neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease, Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration, neuronal positioning, and brain development. In addition, individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in central nervous system (CNS) myelin (particularly cerebral), which is referred to as hypomyelination. Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions, and in this regard, serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain. Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineural degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision.

Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems. Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities (such as a high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and a large fontanelle), hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), chondrodysplasia punctata (punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body), eye abnormalities, and renal cysts. Newborns may present with profound hypotonia (low muscle tone), seizures, apnea, and an inability to eat.

== Cause ==

Zellweger syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode peroxins, proteins required for the normal assembly of peroxisomes. Most commonly, patients have mutations in the &quot;PEX1&quot;, &quot;PEX2&quot;, &quot;PEX3&quot;, &quot;PEX5&quot;, &quot;PEX6&quot;, &quot;PEX10&quot;, &quot;PEX12&quot;, &quot;PEX13&quot;, &quot;PEX14&quot;, &quot;PEX16&quot;, &quot;PEX19&quot;, or &quot;PEX26&quot; genes. In almost all cases, patients have mutations that inactivate or greatly reduce the activity of both the maternal and paternal copies of one these aforementioned &quot;PEX&quot; genes.

As a result of impaired peroxisome function, an individual&#x27;s tissues and cells can accumulate very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) that are normally degraded in peroxisomes. The accumulation of these lipids can impair the normal function of multiple organ systems, as discussed above. In addition, these individuals can show deficient levels of plasmalogens, ether-phospholipids that are especially important for brain and lung function. Bile acid synthesis is defective due to lack of side chain modifications; for example, the last steps in the synthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid involve beta-oxidation of the branched side chains of dihydroxycholestanoic acid or trihydroxycholestanoic acid, respectively, by peroxisomal enzymes.

== Diagnosis ==
In addition to genetic tests involving the sequencing of &quot;PEX&quot; genes, biochemical tests have proven highly effective for the diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome and other peroxisomal disorders. Typically, Zellweger syndrome patients show elevated very long chain fatty acids in their blood plasma. Cultured primary skin fibroblasts obtained from patients show elevated very long chain fatty acids, impaired very long chain fatty acid beta-oxidation, phytanic acid alpha-oxidation, pristanic acid alpha-oxidation, and plasmalogen biosynthesis.

==Treatment==

The nutrient malabsorption resulting from a lack of bile acids has resulted in elemental formula being suggested for feeding. They are low in fat, with less than 3 percent of calories being derived from long-chain triglycerides (LCT). However, reducing dietary very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) has not been shown to reduce blood VLCFA levels, likely because humans can endogenously produce most VLCFA. Plasma VLCFA levels are decreased when dietary VLCFA is reduced in conjunction with supplementation of Lorenzo&#x27;s oil (a 4:1 mixture of glyceryl trioleate and glyceryl trierucate) in X-ALD patients. Since docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) synthesis is impaired [59], DHA supplementation was recommended, but a placebo-controlled study has since shown no clinical efficacy. Due to defective bile acid synthesis, fat-soluble supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K are recommended.

==Prognosis==
Currently, no cure for Zellweger syndrome is known, nor is there a standard course of treatment. In November 2023, at five months old, Christopher Donald Miller was the first patient with Zellweger Syndrome in the United States to have a bone marrow transplant. He did pass away at seven months old of veno-occlusive disease.
Infections should be guarded against to prevent such complications as pneumonia and respiratory distress. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Patients usually do not survive beyond one year of age.

<doc id="1189689" wikidata="Q162387" url="?curid=1189689" title="Hauptsturmführer">
<text>(, ; short: Hstuf) was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank that was used in several Nazi organizations such as the SS, NSKK and the NSFK. The rank of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; was a mid-level commander and had equivalent seniority to a captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;) in the German Army and also the equivalency of captain in foreign armies.

The rank of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; evolved from the older rank of &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot;, created as a rank of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). The SS used the rank of &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot; from 1930 to 1934 at which time, following the Night of the Long Knives, the name of the rank was changed to &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; although the insignia remained the same. &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot; remained an SA rank until 1939/40.

Some of the most infamous SS members are known to have held the rank of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot;. Among them are Josef Mengele, the infamous doctor assigned to Auschwitz; Joseph Kramer, commandant of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp; Franz Stangl, commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka; Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s assistant; and Amon Göth, who was sentenced to death and hanged for committing multiple waves of mass murder (liquidations of the ghettos at Tarnów and Kraków, the camp at Szebnie, the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, as portrayed in the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;).

The insignia of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; was three silver pips and two silver stripes on a black collar patch, worn opposite a unit insignia patch. On the field grey duty uniform, the shoulder boards of an army &quot;Hauptmann&quot; were also displayed. The rank of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; was senior to the rank of &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; and junior to &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;.

<text>(; ; short: Stuhaf), renamed to &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (; short: Hstuf), was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank designation used by both the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The rank was the equivalent of a &quot;Hauptmann&quot; or &quot;Rittmeister&quot; in the German Army, which is the equivalent of &quot;captain&quot; (OF-2) in western militaries.

The rank was first created in 1928 as an SA rank, named &quot;SA-Sturmhauptführer&quot; until 1939/40, and was bestowed upon those SA officers who were company commanders of SA units. The rank translates as &quot;head storm leader&quot; and can trace its origins to the German shock troops of the First World War, who were typically organized into storm trooper companies under an officer ranked lieutenant or captain. &quot;SA-Hauptsturmführer&quot; was initially considered as more of a senior lieutenant, but after 1932 the rank was rated above that of &quot;SA-Obersturmführer&quot; and became the equivalent of a captain. The insignia for the rank was also modified to denote the higher status.

As an SS rank, &quot;SS-Sturmhauptführer&quot; was established in 1930 as a senior rank to that of &quot;SS-Sturmführer&quot;. In 1934, after the Night of the Long Knives, the SS changed the name to &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; (and by then the new lower rank of &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; had been established). This was due in large part to separate the SS rank system from the SA, which by then was considered two completely separate organizations. &quot;Sturmhauptführer&quot; remained an SA rank until 1939/40, and was finally changed to &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot;.

<text>William Painter (or Paynter, c. 1540 – between 19 and 22 February 1595) was an English author and translator. As a clerk of the Ordnance in the Tower of London, he was accused of fraud aimed at amassing a personal fortune at public expense. He is best known for his anthology of translations, &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot;.

==Personal life==
Painter was long believed to be a native of Kent due to confusion with a namesake, who matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1554.

Painter married Dorothy Bonham in about 1565. They had at least five children – a son and four daughters. By 1587 their son Anthony had joined his father in his government work.

Painter made an oral will dated 14 February 1594 and died between 19 and 22 February 1595 in London. He was buried in St Olave Hart Street, not far from the Tower.

==Administrative career==
In 1561 Painter became a clerk of the Ordnance in the Tower of London, a post he held for the rest of his life. In 1566 the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, Edward Randolph, supplemented Painter&#x27;s income with an annuity and a pension.

Throughout his career, there were accusations of fraud and abuse of his position, in which he aimed to amass a personal fortune out of public funds. This culminated in 1586, when the Surveyor of the Ordnance, John Powell, accused Painter and two others of peculation (embezzlement). As his co-accused were deceased, only Painter could defend himself. He confessed that he owed the government a sum of just over £1000. Although he offered to repay this, the debt was not discharged until the time of Painter&#x27;s grandson due to delays in his lifetime and discovery of more discrepancies after his death. The accusations notably comprise charges and counter-charges between government officials, which point to endemic corruption in the Elizabethan civil service.

==Literary work==

Painter began translating into English in 1558 with Nicholas à Moffan&#x27;s &quot;Soltani Soymanni Turcorum Imperatoris horrendum facinus&quot;, as &quot;Horrible and Cruell Murder of Sultan Solyman&quot;. The work later became Novel 34 in his &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot;.

The first volume of Painter&#x27;s &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot; appeared in 1566, dedicated to the Earl of Warwick. It included 60 tales and was followed in the next year by a second volume of 34. A second, improved edition in 1575 contained seven further stories. For these Painter borrowed from Herodotus, Boccaccio, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius, Aelian, Livy, Tacitus, Quintus Curtius, Giovanni Battista Giraldi, Matteo Bandello, Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, Giovanni Francesco Straparola, Queen Marguerite de Navarre and others.

The notable fashion for Italian settings in Elizabethan drama derived partly from the vogue for Painter&#x27;s work and similar collections.

The early tragedies &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot;, and &quot;Tancred and Gismund&quot; were taken from &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, &quot;Edward III&quot;, and &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; are all derived from Painter, the last from his translation of &quot;Giletta of Narbonne&quot;. Other playwrights likewise made extensive use of work by Painter and similar translators. This is believed to be the case with well-known works such as Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;, John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (from Belleforest), and James Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Cruelty&quot;.

&quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot; was edited by Joseph Haslewood in 1813. This edition was collated (1890) with the British Museum copy of 1575 by Joseph Jacobs, who added further prefatory matter, including some on the importance of the Italian novella in Elizabethan drama.

It has been suggested that Painter was responsible for the 1580 work &quot;A Moorning Diti upon the Deceas of the High and Mighti Prins Henri, Earl of Arundel&quot;, attributed to Guil. P. G.

==Namesakes==
Painter had at least one contemporary namesake. One attended Cambridge in 1554–1557, matriculating from St John&#x27;s College. This may be the same William Painter as the schoolmaster of Sevenoaks School, Kent. He translated William Fulke&#x27;s &quot;Antiprognosticon&quot;, published in 1560, writing the dedication &quot;From Seuenoke xxii. of Octobre&quot;. Fulke was a contemporary at St John&#x27;s College. William Painter the schoolmaster died in Sevenoaks in June 1561, leaving a widow, Alice. Church of England records include one or more individuals named William Painter or William Paynter, with ordinations in 1560 and 1561 and appointments in the dioceses of Bath and Wells, Canterbury, Rochester and Lincoln. One William Painter died in London about 1597, leaving a widow, Winifred, and was interred at St Mary Aldermanbury.

<doc id="1189697" wikidata="Q7723100" url="?curid=1189697" title="The Circus of Dr. Lao">
<text>The Circus of Dr. Lao (1935) is a novel written by the American newspaperman and writer Charles G. Finney. It won one of the inaugural National Book Awards: The Most Original Book of 1935.
Although the first edition was illustrated by Boris Artzybasheff, many later editions omit the illustrations.

The paperback edition of 1974 received a positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called the book a &quot;classic American joke&quot;, comparing it to the likes of Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and H. L. Mencken.

&quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot; was re-issued in 2016 as part of the Fantasy Masterworks series. The 2016 edition was reviewed in Starburst, which called it &quot;an experience you shouldn&#x27;t miss and a trip into the dark heart of a Big Top you will never forget&quot;. The review also pointed out the influence of &quot;Dr. Lao&quot; on Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;.

A contemporary reviewer in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was positive, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s crazy – but I liked it. It&#x27;s astoundingly learned – but not annoyingly so&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
The novel is set in the fictional town of Abalone, Arizona. A circus owned by a Chinese man named Dr. Lao pulls into town one day, carrying legendary creatures from all areas of mythology and legend, among them a sea serpent, Apollonius of Tyana (who tells dark, yet always truthful, fortunes), a medusa, and a satyr. Through interactions with the circus, the locals attain various enigmatic peak experiences appropriate to each circus patron&#x27;s personality.

The tale ends with the town becoming the site of a ritual to a pagan god whimsically given the name Yottle (possibly an allusion to the Mesoamerican god Yaotl, whose name means &quot;the enemy&quot;). The ritual ends when the god himself slays a virgin, her unrequited lover, and his own priest. The circus over, the townsfolk scatter to the winds. Apparently few of them profit from their surreal experiences.

The book&#x27;s appendix is a &quot;catalogue&quot; of all the people, places, items, and mythological beings mentioned in the novel, summing up the characters pithily and sardonically, revealing the various fates of the townsfolk, and listing a number of plot holes and unanswered questions not addressed in the narrative.

List of Dr. Lao&#x27;s exhibited creatures and persons:
* Satyr: 2,300 years old, he was captured in Tu-jeng, China, near the Great Wall. He was born of the union of a goatherd and one of his goats.
* Medusa: She is very young and wears very little clothing. She has many species of snakes in her hair, of which three are mentioned: Tantillas, brown with a black ring around their neck; night snakes, gray with black spots; and faded snakes (&quot;Arizona elegans&quot;). She is a Sonoran medusa from northern Mexico.
* Roc chick, &quot;Really not as big as Sinbad thought it was, but plenty big enough to do all that he said it did.&quot; It hatches from an egg that sweats salt water.
* Hound of the hedges: Created when water touched a dry rice field for the first time in many years. His tail is made of ferns; his fur is green grass; instead of teeth he has rose thorns; his blood and saliva are chlorophyll.
* Mermaid: She was captured in the Gulf of Pei-Chihli the same day as the sea serpent. Her tail is sea-green and sleek scaled; her tail fin is as pink as a trout&#x27;s. Her hair is seaweed green; her human half is young and slender with slight breasts.
* Sphinx: A hermaphroditic, African sphinx. Its head is blunt nosed and womanlike; it has breasts like a woman.
* Chimera: The chimera is male, unlike the chimera of Greek myth, thus its body is different. Although it has a lion&#x27;s body and a snake&#x27;s tail, it has eagle&#x27;s wings and a metal barb at the end of its tail with which it can strike like a scorpion. (It seems that Finney describes something closer to a manticore.)
* Sea serpent: He is 80 feet long and dark gray; his tongue is as thick as a man&#x27;s arm and bright yellow. His eyes are bronze with black slits for pupils. His tail is paddle shaped like a sea snake&#x27;s. The Sea Serpent is the only animal that did not become tame after being captured. He plans to escape with the mermaid and return to the sea.
* Werewolf: She starts her transformation as a large gray wolf. (&quot;Not the American lobo. Probably some species from the Carpathians or Urals.&quot;) When she transforms, she changes into an old woman, not the young lady the men are expecting.
* Unicorn: Has a metal &quot;horn&quot;.
* Golden Ass: Lucius Apuleius, who turned into an ass &quot;with the help of Fotis&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

The novel was later adapted by Charles Beaumont into the script for an effects-filled 1964 movie &quot;The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;. The film features a great deal of stop-motion animation which was produced by George Pal, a legendary stop-motion animator.

The movie follows Finney&#x27;s book only vaguely, abridges and changes many of the circus&#x27; exhibited creatures and persons, and inserts a subplot about how the town miser – played by Arthur O&#x27;Connell – who plots to dupe townspeople into selling him their land, as he knows a railroad will soon come to the town.

Each of the &quot;7 faces&quot; is portrayed by actor Tony Randall: He appears as Dr. Lao, who alternates between speaking in stereotypical Chinese broken English and a solemn deep voice and a mastery of English, using several different accents. Randall also plays Medusa; Pan; the Abominable Snowman; Apollonius of Tyana (who serves as the sideshow fortune teller and who is cursed with being unable to shield people from unhappy truths); the magician Merlin (who is so old and fumbling that the obtuse audience does not realize he performs actual miracles, when not performing clumsy sleight of hand); and the faces of a stop-motion serpent that changes its appearance, depending on who looks at it. Finally, Randall portrays a circus patron who appears once in a crowd scene.

According to Turner Classic Movies, Peter Sellers had also been considered seriously for the multiple roles, but was not yet considered a big enough star.

===Pronunciation in the book vs. the film ===
In the book the name Lao is evidently pronounced &quot;Low&quot;, as the doctor recites a doggerel poem which requires that pronunciation for the sake of rhyme. A version of the poem is recited in the film. In the movie the name is variously pronounced to rhyme with &quot;low&quot; and &quot;how&quot;, and Randall himself uses both pronunciations.

Similarly, the town&#x27;s name &quot;Abalone&quot; is pronounced various ways: To rhyme with &quot;have alone&quot;, to rhyme with &quot;Avalon&quot;, and to rhyme with &quot;have a lone(l)y&quot; (like the name of the mollusc, ).

<doc id="1189699" wikidata="Q65168498" url="?curid=1189699" title="Inlet cone">
<text>Inlet cones (sometimes called shock cones or inlet centerbodies) are a component of some supersonic aircraft and missiles. They are primarily used on ramjets, such as the D-21 Tagboard and Lockheed X-7. Some turbojet aircraft including the Su-7, MiG-21, English Electric Lightning, and SR-71 also use an inlet cone.

==Purpose==
An inlet cone, as part of an Oswatitsch-type inlet used on a supersonic aircraft or missile, is the 3D-surface on which supersonic ram compression for a gas turbine engine or ramjet combustor takes place through oblique shock waves. Slowing the air to low supersonic speeds using a cone minimizes loss in total pressure (increases pressure recovery). Also, the cone, together with the inlet cowl lip, determine the area which regulates the flow entering the inlet. If the flow is more than that required by the engine then shock position instability (buzz) can occur. If less than that required then the pressure recovery is lower which reduces engine thrust.

An inlet with cone may be used to supply high pressure air for ramjet equipment which would normally be shaft-driven on a turbine engine, eg to drive turbopumps for the fuel pump on the Bristol Thor ramjet and hydraulic power on the Bristol Bloodhound missile.

==Shape==
The cone angle is chosen such that, at the design condition for the inlet (Mach 1.7 for the English Electric Lightning inlet), the shock wave that forms on its apex coincides with the cowl lip. The inlet passes its maximum airflow and achieves its maximum pressure recovery. A higher design speed may require two oblique shocks focussed on the lip to maintain an acceptable pressure recovery and pass maximum airflow. In this case a biconic cone is required with two angles ( the Bristol Thor ramjet has 24 and 31 degrees for a design speed of Mach 2.5). For higher speeds a more smoothly contoured transition between cone angles may be used in what is known as an isentropic spike (Marquardt RJ43 ramjet).

The conical body may be a complete cone centerbody in a round inlet (MiG-21), a half cone in a side-fuselage inlet (Lockheed F-104 Starfighter) or a quarter cone in a side-fuselage/underwing inlet (General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark).

The rear of the cone beyond its maximum diameter, rear-facing and unseen inside the duct, is shaped for a similar reason to the protruding front part. The visible cone is a supersonic diffuser with a requirement for low loss in total pressure, and the rear, streamlined part, together with the internal surface profile of the duct, forms the subsonic diffuser, also with a requirement for low loss in total pressure as the air slows to the compressor entry Mach number.

For Mach numbers below about 2.2 all the shock compression is done externally. For higher Mach numbers part of the supersonic diffusion has to take place inside the duct, known as external/internal or mixed compression. In this case the rear part of the forward-facing conical surface, together with the internal surface profile of the duct, continues the supersonic diffusion with reflected oblique shocks until the final normal shock. In the case of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird with part of the supersonic compression taking place inside the ducting the spike and internal cowl surfaces were curved for gradual isentropic compression. The inlet cone also has different axial positions to control how the capture area varies with the duct internal throat area. For best intake operation this required area ratio gets bigger with increasing flight Mach number, hence the large inlet cone movement on the SR-71 which had to perform well from low speeds to Mach 3.2. On the SR-71 the cone moves back at higher speeds.

==Operation==
At subsonic flight speeds, the conical inlet operates much like a pitot intake or subsonic diffuser. However, as the vehicle goes supersonic a conical shock wave
appears, emanating from the cone apex. The flow area through the shock wave decreases and the air is compressed. As the flight Mach number increases, the conical shock wave becomes more oblique and eventually impinges on the intake lip.

For higher flight speeds a moving cone becomes necessary to allow the supersonic compression to occur more efficiently over a wider range of speeds. With increasing flight speed, in typical Oswatitsch-type supersonic moving-cone inlet - the cone is moved forward (MiG-21), and if it is non-Oswatitsch-type cone inlet (SR-71) it is moved to the rear, or into the intake. In both cases, due to the shape of the cone surface and the internal duct surface the internal flow area gets less as required to continue compressing the air supersonically. The compression occurring in this path is called &quot;internal compression&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;external compression&quot; on the cone). At the minimum flow area, or throat, a normal or plane shock occurs. The flow area then increases for subsonic compression, or diffusion, up to the engine face.

The position of the cone within the intake is usually controlled automatically to keep the plane shock wave correctly located just downstream of the throat. Certain circumstances can cause the shock wave to be expelled from the intake. This is known as an unstart.

==Alternative shapes==
Some air inlets feature a biconic centrebody (MIG-21) to form two conic shock waves, both focused on the lip of the intake. This improves pressure recovery.
Some aircraft (BAC TSR-2, F-104, Mirage III) use a semi-conic centrebody.
The F-111 has a quarter cone, which moves axially, followed by an expanding cone section.

Concorde, Tu-144, F-15 Eagle, MiG-25 Foxbat, and the A-5 Vigilante use so-called 2D inlets, where the nacelle is rectangular and a flat intake ramp replaces the dual cones.
Inlet ramps allow for swept inlet cowls (F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II) to avoid shocks.

Some other supersonic aircraft (Eurofighter Typhoon) use a variable lower cowl lip for high angle of attack operation and a bleed system (porous wall) incorporated on the intake ramp to facilitate stabilization of the shock system at supersonic Mach numbers. For the improvement of the intake flow (reduced distortion), air is dumped via an intake bleed slot on the ramp side downstream of the intake. The ramp, which is separated from the fuselage by a diverter, produces an oblique shock in order to decelerate the flow. The leading edge of the splitter plate separating the two intakes is located downstream of this oblique shock.

Many supersonic aircraft (F-16 Fighting Falcon) dispense with the conical centrebody and employ a simple pitot intake, which is structurally lighter. A detached, strong normal shock appears directly in front of the inlet at supersonic flight speeds, which leads to poorer pressure recovery.

NASA has tested an alternative to the external/internal, or mixed compression inlet, needed for speeds above about Mach 2.2 (below that speed inlets with all-external compression are used). The mixed-compression inlet is susceptible to unstarts or expulsion of the internal shock to in front of the inlet. The NASA inlet, which they call a Parametric Inlet, does all the supersonic compression externally so there is no shock inside the ducting in a potentially unstable location.

<text>Robert Paltock (1697– March 20, 1767) was an English novelist and attorney. His most famous work is &quot;The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a Cornish Man&quot; (1751).

==Biography==
The only son of Thomas Paltock of St James&#x27;s, Westminster, Paltock was born in 1697. He became an attorney and lived for some time in Clement&#x27;s Inn. He then moved, before 1759, to Back Lane, Lambeth. He married Anna Skinner, through whom his son, also named Robert, inherited a small property at Ryme Intrinseca, Dorset. There Robert Paltock, who died in London on 20 March 1767, was buried.

==Work==
&quot;The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins&quot; is somewhat on the same plan as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, the special feature being the &quot;gawry&quot;, or flying woman, whom hero discovered on his island, and married. John W. Cousin, author of &quot;A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature&quot;, was not impressed by it, saying:
:&quot;The description of Nosmnbdsgrutt, [sic] the country of the flying people, is a dull imitation of Swift, and much else in the book is tedious.&quot;

Paltock&#x27;s book was admired by Walter Scott, Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Leigh Hunt and Charles Lamb. The book was reprinted several times, notably with an introduction by A. H. Bullen in 1884. It was translated into French (1763) and into German (1767).

<text>Julia Pardoe (4 December 1804 – 26 November 1862), was an English poet, novelist, historian and travel writer. Her most popular work, &quot;The City of the Sultan and Domestic Manners of the Turks&quot; (1837), presented the Ottoman Turkish upper class with sympathy and humanity.

==Life==
Julia Sophia H. Pardoe was born in Beverley, Yorkshire. She was the second daughter born to Major Thomas Pardoe, who was said to be of Spanish extraction, and his wife Elizabeth. Her father served in the Royal Waggon Train in the Peninsular campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars and fought at Waterloo before retiring from the service. Pardoe was baptized at Beverley on 4 December 1804. She began writing at an early age and anonymously published her first work, &quot;The Nun: a Poetical Romance, and Two Others&quot; (1824), at the end of her teens. Like many others in the early 19th century, she moved south to avoid tuberculosis. There she found material for her first book. In 1835, she travelled to Turkey with her father, on a trip which inspired some of her most popular writings.

Pardoe lived in London until 1842, when overwork caused her to return to live with her parents, first at Perry Street, then at Northfleet, Kent. Her contributions to literature gained Pardoe a civil-list pension in January 1860.

===Death===
Pardoe fell victim to insomnia and chronic liver disease and died on 26 November 1862 at Upper Montagu Street, London. She was unmarried. Her death certificate gave her age as 56 at the time of her death, but baptismal records indicate that she was actually 58. She is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Work==
A gifted and varied writer, Pardoe published many books on varied subjects that strayed across genres and often had an international perspective. Many of her works were originally published in serial form in British and American periodicals.

===Poetry===
Pardoe&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;The Nun: a Poetical Romance, and Two Others&quot; (1824), was dedicated to her uncle, Captain William Pardoe.

===Novels===
Her first novel, published anonymously in 1829, was &quot;Lord Morcar of Hereward&quot;. Other works include &quot;Speculation&quot;, published in 1834, &quot;The Mardens and the Daventrys&quot; in 1835, &quot;The Romance of the Harem&quot; in 1839, and &quot;Hungarian Castle&quot; in 1842. After returning to Kent, Pardoe wrote for &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Illuminated Magazine&quot;, and several annuals. She also published further novels: &quot;The Confessions of a Pretty Woman&quot; in 1846, &quot;The Rival Beauties&quot; in 1848, &quot;Flies in Amber&quot; in 1850, &quot;Reginald Lyle&quot; in 1854, &quot;The Jealous Wife&quot; in 1855, &quot;Lady Arabella&quot; in 1856, &quot;A Life-Struggle&quot; in 1859 and &quot;The Rich Relation&quot; in 1862.

===Travelogues and cultural studies===
While travelling abroad, she wrote her first travel book, &quot;Traits and Traditions of Portugal&quot;, which was published in 1833. In 1835, while at Constantinople, Julia witnessed the horrors brought on the population by the plague epidemic of that year. She was inspired by her travels with her father to publish &quot;The City of the Sultan and Domestic Manners of the Turks&quot; in 1837. Previously, Europeans had an aggrandized view of the Ottoman Turkish people, but Pardoe&#x27;s work presented its upper class with sympathy and humanity. The book became so popular it was republished in a three-volume set in 1838, 1845, and 1854. In 1838, Pardoe published &quot;The Beauties of the Bosphorus&quot; and &quot;The River and the Desart&quot;. The latter is a collection of letters to a friend, offering a personal account of her own experiences. &quot;The City of Magyar&quot;, published in 1840, includes thorough research into Hungarian economic and political life. It was also considered an easier and more accessible read than her other books.

===Histories===
Her most enduring works, reprinted in the 20th century, were her historical writings on the French 16th and 17th-century courts. These included &quot;Louis the Fourteenth and the Court of France in the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1847), &quot;The Court and Reign of Francis the First, King of France&quot; (1849), and &quot;The Life of , Queen of France, Consort of , and Regent of the Kingdom Under Louis XIII&quot; (1852).

===Editing===
In editing and working on the writing of others, Pardoe translated Guido Sorelli&#x27;s &quot;La Peste&quot; (The Plague) in 1834 and edited Anita George&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Queens of Spain&quot;, published in 1850. In 1857, she wrote the introduction to &quot;The Thousand and One Days; a Companion to the Arabian Nights&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Contemporaries recalled Pardoe as warm-hearted and animated, as well as extremely talented. Samuel Carter Hall said of the late author, she was a &quot;fairy-footed, fair-haired, laughing sunny girl&quot; in her youth, but he poked fun at her attempts to appear girlish in middle age, due to a horror of ageing.

Early in her career, Pardoe caught the attention of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, who became interested in her work and asked her to dedicate her next work &quot;Traits and Traditions of Portugal&quot; (1834) to her, which Pardoe obligingly did and it sold rapidly. Poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning praised &quot;City of Magyar&quot; as &quot;word painting&quot;. Scholars have credited Pardoe with helping to create an enduring positive impression of Hungary in England. Her book on Francis the First was commended for being comprehensive, covering both his public and private life. However, her study of Marie de&#x27; Medici was criticized as diffuse and unfocused. In her later years, Pardoe&#x27;s work was known to vary greatly in quality.

According to &quot;The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art in&quot; 1857, her Hungarian travelogue compares favourably with her earlier books on various cultures, exhibiting &quot;deeper research; its statistics are peculiarly accurate, and it is on all hands admitted to be one of the best books of travel submitted to the public.&quot; The magazine also noted the usefulness of Pardoe&#x27;s &quot;The Hungarian Castle&quot; (1842), which consists of three volumes of Hungarian folklore, &quot;filling up a very little known page in the legendary history of Europe&quot;.

In 1858, J. Cordy Jeaffreson stated in &quot;Novels and Novelists&quot; that Pardoe had been &quot;favourably circumstanced for the development of her intellect,&quot; for &quot;delicate health at an early part of her life secured her the quiet retirement necessary for meditation and study, and her extended travels have supplied her susceptible mind and retentive memory with the best possible materials for thought.&quot;

Joseph Johnson included Pardoe in his &quot;Clever Girls of Our Time: And How They Became Famous Women&quot; (1862). His piece on her begins, &quot;With few exceptions, Famous Women have all been Clever Girls. From their infantine years they have been celebrated for a love of books: for the perseverance which marked their pursuit of knowledge: for intense industry in their studies, and the eagerness with which they followed that which had become the end and aim of existence.&quot; He concludes that Pardoe&#x27;s life and entire literary career, &quot;its industry, its perseverance, and its unswerving continuance, are beyond all praise, as they are worthy of all emulation.&quot;

<text>MonoKote was a commercially available lightweight plastic shrink wrap film available in various colors. It had a heat-activated adhesive on one side and was used to cover the surfaces of a model aircraft. The material is cut to size and applied to the airframe surfaces using a hobby iron and heat gun. Top Flite MonoKote covering film is produced by General Formulations of Sparta, Michigan.

The name MonoKote, a registered trademark of model aircraft manufacturer Top Flite, refers to the fact that it is a one-step covering material to coat the surface of the model. MonoKote was discontinued by Top Flite&#x27;s subsequent owners, Horizon Hobbies.
The patent for Top Flite MonoKote is held by Sidney Axelrod

Unrelated to the model aircraft material, MonoKote is also a type of fireproofing material, which is either gypsum- or cement-based and is spray-applied. The name MONOKOTE is the subject of global trademark registrations owned by GCP Applied Technologies Inc., a Delaware Corporation formed from the Grace Construction Products and Packaging businesses that were spun off from W. R. Grace &amp; Co. in February 2016 (e.g., US Registration No. 1,468,327; Canadian Registration No. 858389; and other international registrations).

<text>Vegas (stylized as Vega$) is an American crime drama television series starring Robert Urich that aired on ABC from September 20, 1978, to June 3, 1981, with the pilot episode airing April 25, 1978. &quot;Vegas&quot; was produced by Aaron Spelling and was created by Michael Mann. The series (with the exception of special episodes filmed in Hawaii and San Francisco) was filmed in its entirety on location in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Urich stars as private detective Dan Tanna, who drives to his detective assignments around the streets of Las Vegas in a flashy red 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible. (The 1957 red T-Bird replaced a 1967 yellow Chevrolet Corvette that was Tanna&#x27;s car in the pilot episode, a car which ended up being destroyed by fire.) Working for a wide variety of Las Vegas clients, the detective work included locating missing persons, helping solve various Las Vegas hotel and casino crimes, solving casino chip and money scams, and working to make Las Vegas a safer place for residents and tourists alike. Dan Tanna makes a point of not accepting divorce cases, or working as a bodyguard. Being in Las Vegas, Tanna is occasionally hired to work for well-known celebrity clients who have issues regarding their personal safety, and need help solving personal issues or threats against them.

==Plot==
Dan Tanna (Robert Urich) is a high-end Las Vegas private detective, whose many different clients include series regular Phillip &#x27;Slick&#x27; Roth (Tony Curtis), the owner of several hotel casinos, including the Maxim Hotel Casino and the Desert Inn hotel and country club in Las Vegas. Tanna is often called by private citizens to help investigate unsolved criminal cases, locate missing family or business associates, or even work in rather absurd situations, such as the property case of a nun, played by Cassie Yates, who has a claim deed that says she owns the Las Vegas land on which the Desert Inn Hotel Casino stands. Tanna has the reputation of being a high-risk crime problem-solver; thus, he will not accept bodyguard assignments or handle divorce cases. Given that many of his detective cases are dangerous, he carries a powerful sidearm at all times.

Tanna lives on the Las Vegas Strip next to the Circus Circus hotel/casino, in the theatrical showroom props warehouse owned by the Desert Inn. The large props warehouse where he lives has been partially converted into his living quarters. The unique garage design of Tanna&#x27;s home allows him to park his red Ford Thunderbird convertible in his living room. Tanna also uses gadgets considered high-tech for the very late 1970s, such as a radio car phone, and an answering machine that physically picks his phone off the hook and into the microphone of a tape recorder.

Two snow days, rare events in Las Vegas, were worked into the plots of separate episodes.

Longtime gaming executive Burton Cohen, a leading figure in Las Vegas casinos since the mid 1960s and three-time president of the Desert Inn, including a period from 1978 to the mid-1980s when the series was being produced, appeared as himself in three episodes; also the public address system of the Desert Inn could be heard loudly announcing several times during almost every episode: “Paging Mr. Cohen, Mr. Burton Cohen.”

===Characters===
Dan Tanna (Urich) is a tough, but also very smart and sensitive, Las Vegas private detective. He tries to be thorough and professional with his work, carefully tracking down the pieces of evidence needed to solve a wide variety of criminal and civil cases. Various &quot;Vegas&quot; episodes document, through flashbacks, Tanna&#x27;s dangerous combat experiences in the Vietnam War. Though Dan Tanna carries a handgun he flashes and even fires in self defense when necessary, he also tries to use his intelligence and his many Las Vegas connections to solve crimes and solve cases. Tanna tools around Las Vegas, and Nevada, in his beautiful 1957 red Ford Thunderbird.

Beatrice Travis (Phyllis Davis), Tanna&#x27;s Girl Friday, is a widowed single mother who moonlights in season 1 as a Las Vegas showgirl. As she takes on more responsibilities as Tanna&#x27;s assistant, her showgirl role diminishes. Though Bea and Tanna make a dashing couple, their relationship is platonic, except for occasional friendly kisses. Beatrice pushes Tanna to try to stay busy, often saying to him on the phone, &quot;earn some money, honey&quot;, and they appeared to be close personal friends throughout the 69 episodes of &quot;Vegas&quot;.

Phillip &quot;Slick&quot; Roth (Tony Curtis) is Tanna&#x27;s primary client and lead generator. Roth is a self-made millionaire, a hands-on businessman, who owns and manages both the Desert Inn Resort and the Maxim Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. Though Roth is sarcastic and hard-bitten, Roth sincerely likes Dan Tanna, and often expresses how much he treasures Tanna&#x27;s loyalty, and feels he has a father-son relationship with him. &#x27;Slick&#x27; Roth made 17 episode appearances throughout the three-year prime-time run of &quot;Vegas&quot;. Roth relies on Tanna to help him in a wide variety of criminal and civil cases involving his businesses. Though Roth is now a wealthy man, he always remembers the stressful and tough times before he was wealthy, and he often exhibits an earthy and self-deprecating sense of humor in his dealings with Dan Tanna, the casino and hotel guests, his showroom employees and showgirls, and the many other employees on his hotel staffs.

Dave Nelson (Greg Morris) is a lieutenant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and while he is a no-nonsense officer, he often backs up Tanna in criminal case investigations, and vice versa. While Lt. Nelson is never one to breach police protocol, he sometimes secretly assists Tanna in criminal cases on which his police force is prohibited from officially working. In the first season of &quot;Vegas&quot;, Nelson had a more adversarial relationship with Tanna, but their working friendship grows over the next two seasons. In the pilot, Nelson&#x27;s first name was George and was played by Raymond St. Jacques.

Bella Archer (Naomi Stevens) is a sergeant in the Las Vegas Metro police department who also assists both Tanna and Nelson in criminal-case research. Bella filed criminal cases in the police department, and while she was sarcastic, she was also adept at giving Dan Tanna inside criminal information whenever possible. Bella Archer appeared only in the first &quot;Vegas&quot; season.

Binzer (Bart Braverman) assists with Tanna&#x27;s detective leg work, and also moonlights part time as a pool assistant at the Desert Inn. Early in the &quot;Vegas&quot; series, Binzer is revealed to be a former petty thief who fled to Las Vegas to escape his former partners in crime back east. His criminal background is described in one &quot;Vegas&quot; episode, in which Binzer&#x27;s real name is revealed to be Robert (Bobby) Borso. Always the protective detective, Dan Tanna invariably seems to take Binzer under his wing, and wisely uses Binzer&#x27;s knowledge of the streets, and his connections to the Las Vegas street scene. Bart Braverman appeared in the pilot episode as an unnamed character (possibly a pimp or the henchman of one) that Tanna shakes down for information concerning the disappearance of a young woman. During the shakedown, Tanna, possibly out of surprise that he extracted the information rather easily, tells him he is &quot;not cut out for this kind of work&quot;. If this was actually the foundation for the introduction of Binzer&#x27;s character, it is never revealed.

Angie (Judy Landers), is Tanna&#x27;s secondary office assistant; Angie is a part-time working showgirl. Unlike the savvy and clever Beatrice, Angie is sweet, but also somewhat scatterbrained, and occasionally gets case work and names mixed up. Angie does not appear in &quot;Vegas&quot; after the first season, with Bea assuming virtually all office-related responsibilities.

Harlon Twoleaf (Will Sampson) is Tanna&#x27;s close friend who served with him in the Vietnam War, and occasionally assists in some of his detective cases. Twoleaf, who disappeared after the conclusion of the first season, owns a small, working horse ranch, and he enjoys reminiscing with Tanna about their younger days. Twoleaf often is the &quot;muscle&quot; during Tanna&#x27;s Las Vegas criminal investigations. A proud Native American, his imposing appearance is enough to scare suspects and informants into submission, with little violence actually taking place.

===Guest stars===
The Chuck Connors &quot;Vega$&quot; episode was filmed at the historic Daydream Ranch. Robert Reed and Maureen McCormick portrayed a father and daughter in a season-one episode, &quot;The Pageant&quot;. The duo previously starred together in &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; (1969–74), in which Reed portrayed family patriarch Mike, with McCormick as eldest daughter Marcia. In a later episode, Reed reappeared as Phillip Roth&#x27;s brother.

Robert Mandan and Robert Urich had worked together in the situation comedy &quot;Soap&quot;. Mandan played Chester Tate, Jessica Tate&#x27;s husband and Urich as Jessica&#x27;s lover, Peter the tennis pro, who was murdered by Chester Tate.

Heather Menzies was Robert Urich&#x27;s real-life wife, and they were married in 1975.

==Production==
Michael Mann was credited as the creator, although he only had one writing credit for the show with the pilot film in &quot;High Roller&quot;, which aired on April 25, 1978. Mann reflected on the show in 2012 on his idea for the show and his feelings on the production.

<doc id="1189712" wikidata="Q685643" url="?curid=1189712" title="Fajr (prayer)">
<text>The fajr prayer, alternatively transliterated as fadjr prayer, and also known as the subh prayer, is a salah (ritual prayer) offered in the early morning. Consisting of two rak&#x27;a (units), it is performed between the break of dawn and sunrise. It is one of two prayers mentioned by name in the Qur&#x27;an. Due to its timing, Islamic belief holds the fajr prayer to be of great importance. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Muslims begin fasting with the fajr prayer.

== Performance ==
The fajr prayer consists of two compulsory (fardh) units of prayer (rak&#x27;a). In addition, the voluntary sunnah prayer consists of two units of prayer and can be performed before the compulsory prayer. 

In fajr, Al-Fatiha and the additional surah are to be read aloud (&quot;jahr&quot;), as during Maghrib and Isha. It is commonly performed silently when waking up in the morning.

The prayer includes wudu (ritual purification) and salat (ritual prayer).

Fajr replaced salat al-duha as the morning prayer before the five prayers were standardized.

== Textual references ==

=== Qur&#x27;an ===

Qur&#x27;an 11:114 commands Muhammad to recite at dawn. This verse is taken as foundational for prescribing the times for prayer. 

In Qur&#x27;an 17:78, dawn is one of the three times that prayer is to be performed. According to Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti&#x27;s commentary on angels (&quot;Al-Haba&#x27;ik fi Akhbar al-Mala&#x27;ik&quot;), this verse describes the witnessing of dawn prayer by the angels of the day and the night.

== Timings ==

The timings for the prayer are prescribed by the hadith.

==See also==

<doc id="1189713" wikidata="Q2572480" url="?curid=1189713" title="The Amityville Horror">
<text>The Amityville Horror is a book by American author Jay Anson, published in September 1977. It is also the basis of a series of films released from 1979 onward. The book is based on the claims of paranormal experiences by the Lutz family but has led to controversy and lawsuits over its truthfulness.

== Historical basis ==

On November 13, 1974, 23-year old Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed six members of his family at their home. They lived at 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house situated in a suburban neighborhood in Amityville, on the south shore of Long Island, New York. After a trial lasting seven weeks, DeFeo was convicted of second-degree murder in November 1975 and sentenced to six terms of 25 years to life in prison. DeFeo died in prison in March 2021.

In December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the house with their three children and dog, Harry. After 28 days, the Lutzes fled the house, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there.

== Plot ==

The book describes the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style, and had a distinctive gambrel roof. It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975, and each had their own homes, but they wanted to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided that it was not a problem.

The Lutz family moved in on December 18, 1975. Much of the DeFeo family&#x27;s furniture was still in the house, because it was included for $400 as part of the deal. A friend of George Lutz learned about the history of the house and insisted on having it blessed. At the time, George was a non-practicing Methodist and had no experience of what this would entail. Kathy was a non-practicing Catholic and explained the process. George knew a Catholic priest named Father Ray who agreed to carry out the house blessing (in Anson&#x27;s book, real-life priest Father Ralph J. Pecoraro is referred to as Father Mancuso for privacy reasons).

Father Mancuso was a lawyer, judge of the Catholic Court and psychotherapist who lived at the local Sacred Heart Rectory. He arrived to perform the blessing while George and Kathy were unpacking their belongings on the afternoon of December 18, 1975, and went into the building to carry out the rites. When he flicked the first holy water and began to pray, he heard a masculine voice demand that he &quot;get out&quot;. When leaving the house, Father Mancuso did not mention this incident to either George or Kathy. On December 24, 1975, Father Mancuso called George Lutz and advised him to stay out of the second floor room where he had heard the mysterious voice, the former bedroom of Marc and John Matthew DeFeo, that Kathy planned to use as a sewing room, but the call was cut short by static. Following his visit to the house, Father Mancuso allegedly developed a high fever and blisters on his hands similar to stigmata. At first George and Kathy experienced nothing unusual in the house. Talking about their experiences subsequently, they reported that it was as if they &quot;were each living in a different house&quot;.

By mid-January 1976, after another attempt at a house blessing by George and Kathy, they experienced what would turn out to be their final night in the house. The Lutzes declined to give a full account of the events that took place on this occasion, describing them as &quot;too frightening&quot;.

After getting in touch with Father Mancuso, the Lutzes decided to take some belongings and stay at Kathy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in nearby Deer Park, New York, until they had sorted out the problems with the house. They claimed that the phenomena followed them there, with the final scene of Anson&#x27;s book describing slime&quot; coming up the staircase towards them. On January 14, 1976, George and Kathy Lutz, with their three children and their dog Harry, left 112 Ocean Avenue, leaving all of their possessions behind. The next day, a mover arrived to remove the possessions to send to the Lutzes. He reported no paranormal phenomena while inside the house.

The book was written after Tam Mossman, an editor at the publishing house Prentice Hall, introduced George and Kathy Lutz to Jay Anson. The Lutzes did not work directly with Anson, but submitted around 45 hours of tape-recorded recollections to him, which were used as the basis of the book. Estimates of the sales of the book are around 10 million copies from its numerous editions. Anson is said to have based the title of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; on &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft, which was published in 1929.

* The story of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was continued in a series of books by John G. Jones, with &quot;The Amityville Horror Part II&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;&quot; (1988) and &quot;&quot; (1989). In 1991, &quot;&quot; by Robin Karl was published.
* Hans Holzer wrote three books relating the story: &quot;Murder in Amityville&quot;, &quot;The Amityville Curse&quot; and &quot;The Secret of Amityville&quot;. &quot;Murder in Amityville&quot; was used as the basis of the 1982 film &quot;Amityville II: The Possession&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;The Amityville Curse&quot; was based on the book of the same name. William Weber, the defense attorney for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial, recommended Holzer to DeFeo in 1979 as a way for DeFeo to obtain a book deal telling his side of the story. The 1983 film &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot; was also turned into a novelization by Gordon McGill. &quot;Mentally Ill in Amityville&quot;, a factual account of the case by Will Savive, was published in 2008.

== Disputes over accuracy ==

The role of Father Pecoraro (&quot;Father Mancuso&quot; in the book) has been given considerable attention. Father Pecoraro stated in an affidavit during a lawsuit in the late 1970s that his only contact with the Lutzes concerning the matter had been by telephone. Other accounts say that Father Pecoraro did visit the house but experienced nothing unusual there. In 1979, he described his experience while blessing the Amityville house during an interview for the television series &quot;In Search of...&quot;. In the interview, he makes it clear that he did in fact enter the home and that he was slapped by an invisible force and told to &quot;get out&quot; by a disembodied voice.

Jim and Barbara Cromarty rejected the claims of physical damage to doors, locks, and windows. They bought the house for $55,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in March 1977. Barbara Cromarty argued that they appeared to be the original items and had not been repaired. The couple also revealed that the &quot;Red Room&quot; was a small closet in the basement and would have been known to the Lutzes because it was not concealed in any way. Local Shinnecock Indians rejected the claim made in chapter 11 of the book that the house was built on a site where the tribe had once abandoned the mentally ill and the dying. 

Researchers Rick Moran and Peter Jordan rejected the claim of cloven hoof prints in the snow on January 1, 1976. Their investigation revealed that there had been no snowfall at that time. No neighbor reported anything unusual during the time that the Lutzes were living there. Police officers are depicted visiting the house in the book and 1979 film, but records showed that the Lutzes did not call the police. There was no bar in Amityville called &quot;The Witches&#x27; Brew&quot; at the time.

Stephen Kaplan and other critics have pointed out that changes were made to the book as it was reprinted in different editions. In the original hardcover edition, Father Pecoraro&#x27;s car is &quot;an old tan Ford&quot;, and he experiences an incident in which the hood flies up against the windshield while he is driving it. In later editions, the car is described as a Chevrolet Vega, before reverting to a Ford.

In May 1977, George and Kathy Lutz filed a lawsuit against William Weber (the defense lawyer for Ronald DeFeo, Jr.), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had examined the house), along with &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine, the &quot;New York Sunday News&quot;, and the Hearst Corporation. The Lutzes alleged misappropriation of names for trade purposes, invasion of privacy, and mental distress. The claims against the news corporations were dropped and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn District Court judge Jack B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes&#x27; claims. In the September 17, 1979 issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine, William Weber wrote: &quot;I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine.&quot; This refers to a meeting that Weber had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what became the outline of Anson&#x27;s book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: &quot;There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents.&quot; Weber himself &quot;filed a two-million-dollar lawsuit against the couple, charging them with reneging on their book deal&quot;, while the Cromartys launched a suit &quot;against the Lutz parents, author Anson, and his publisher. [...] During the trials, the Lutzes admitted that virtually everything in &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was pure fiction&quot;, according to an article in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.

George Lutz maintained that events in the book were &quot;mostly true&quot;. In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a polygraph test relating to their experiences at the house. The polygraph tests were performed by Chris Gugas and Michael Rice, who were reportedly among the top five polygraph experts in America. The results, in Rice&#x27;s opinion, did not indicate lying. However, skeptics have pointed out that polygraph tests &quot;are notoriously unreliable&quot;, and that &quot;there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.&quot;

In October 2000, The History Channel broadcast &quot;Amityville: The Haunting&quot; and &quot;Amityville: Horror or Hoax?&quot;, a two-part documentary made by horror screenwriter/producer Daniel Farrands.

The debate continues concerning the accuracy of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. The various owners of the house since 1976 have publicly reported no problems while living there. James Cromarty bought the house in 1977 and lived there with his wife Barbara for ten years; he commented: &quot;Nothing weird ever happened, except for people coming by because of the book and the movie.&quot;

The 1979 film, based on Jay Anson&#x27;s novel, is the best known in the series. James Brolin and Margot Kidder portray the couple George and Kathy Lutz. The part of the priest who blesses the house (renamed Father Delaney in the film) was played by Academy Award–winning actor Rod Steiger. The first three &quot;Amityville&quot; films received a theatrical release, while the fourth film was made for television by NBC. The sequels from the 1990s were released direct to video and contain virtually no material relating to the Lutz family or the DeFeo murders. Instead, they concentrate on paranormal phenomena caused by cursed items supposedly linked to the house.

One of the better known features of the &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; films is the distinctive jack-o&#x27;-lantern-like appearance of the house, which was created by two quarter round windows on the third floor attic level. The windows are often illuminated in the films, giving the appearance of menacing eyes. The first three films were filmed at a house in Toms River, New Jersey which had been converted to look like 112 Ocean Avenue after the authorities in Amityville denied permission for location filming. Although not all of the films in &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; series are set at the former Lutz home on Ocean Avenue, the distinctive Dutch Colonial house is traditionally used as the main image in promotional material.

In 2005, a remake of the original &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; film was released, with the tagline &quot;Katch em and kill em&quot;, referring to the claimed link between the house in Ocean Avenue and John Ketcham, whose name has been linked to witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts but remains a controversial and elusive figure. This version exaggerates the isolation of 112 Ocean Avenue by depicting it as a remote house similar to the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;. In reality, 112 Ocean Avenue is a suburban house within of other houses in the neighborhood. The house used in the 2005 version was in Silver Lake, Wisconsin, while other location work was shot in nearby Antioch, Illinois. The child character Jodie DeFeo, appearing in the film, is fictional and was not one of the victims of the shootings by Ronald DeFeo, Jr. in November 1974. George Lutz described the 2005 remake as &quot;drivel&quot; and sued the makers for breach of contract, defamation and libel. He objected particularly to the scene in the film where the male lead – named George Lutz and played by Ryan Reynolds – is shown killing the family dog with an axe. The film also shows the George Lutz character building coffins for members of his own family. The defamation claim was dismissed by a Los Angeles court in November 2005, while other issues related to the lawsuit remained unresolved at the time of George Lutz&#x27;s death.

The documentary &quot;My Amityville Horror&quot; was released in March 2013. It featured interviews with Daniel Lutz, one of the children who lived in the house during the period on which the book and films are based. Lutz echos the original story as told by his mother and step-father. He also makes additional claims that both he and George Lutz were possessed and that George Lutz demonstrated telekinetic abilities, and strongly suggests that George&#x27;s dabbling in the occult may have initiated the demonic events.

== Legacy ==
Kathleen Theresa Lutz (October 13, 1946 – August 17, 2004) died of emphysema and George Lee Lutz (January 1, 1947 – May 8, 2006) died of heart disease. The couple had divorced in the late 1980s, but remained on good terms.

During the period in which the Lutz family was living at 112 Ocean Avenue, Stephen Kaplan, a self-styled vampirologist and ghost hunter, was called in to investigate the house. Kaplan and the Lutzes had a falling out after Kaplan said that he would expose any fraud that was found. Kaplan went on to write a critical book titled &quot;The Amityville Horror Conspiracy&quot; with his wife Roxanne Salch Kaplan. The book was published in 1995.

On the night of March 6, 1976, the house was investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren, a husband and wife team self-described as demonologists, together with a crew from the television station Channel 5 New York and reporter Michael Linder of WNEW-FM. During the course of the investigation Gene Campbell took a series of infrared time-lapse photographs. One of the images allegedly showed a &quot;demonic boy&quot; with glowing eyes who was standing at the foot of a staircase. The photograph did not emerge into the public domain until 1979, when George and Kathy Lutz and Rod Steiger appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; to promote the release of the first film. 112 Ocean Avenue was also investigated by the parapsychologist Hans Holzer. The Warrens and Holzer have suggested that the house is occupied by malevolent spirits due to its history. The Warrens&#x27; visit to the house was depicted in the 2016 film &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot;.

George Lutz registered the phrase &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; as a trademark in 2002 and it is referred to as &quot;The Amityville Horror™&quot; on his official website. Lutz claimed that the film producers embellished or fabricated events portrayed in the 1979 version and the 2005 remake. He also claimed that the producers of the 2005 film did not involve his family and that they used his name without permission.

The house known as 112 Ocean Avenue still exists, but it has been renovated and the address changed to discourage sightseers from visiting it. The quarter round windows have been removed and the house today looks considerably different from its depiction in the films. The house in Toms River used as the location for the first three films has also been modified for the same reason. For the 2005 film version, the house address was changed to 412 Ocean Avenue. The 2005 film remake says that the basement of the Lutz home was built in 1692, but 112 Ocean Avenue – also known as &quot;High Hopes&quot; – was built around 1924 for John and Catherine Moynahan.

The local residents and authorities in Amityville, New York, are unhappy with the attention that &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; brings to the town, and tend to decline requests to discuss it publicly. The website of the Amityville Historical Society makes no mention of the murders by Ronald DeFeo, Jr. in 1974 or the period that the Lutz family lived at 112 Ocean Avenue. When the History Channel made its documentary about &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; in 2000, no member of the Historical Society would discuss the matter on camera.

The episode of &quot;&quot; first broadcast on October 31, 2007, was a Halloween edition based on &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. Entitled &quot;Boo&quot;, it features a house in Amityville where a family has died in circumstances similar to the DeFeo murders.

In May 2010, the house was placed on the market with an asking price of $1.15 million. In August 2010, the house was sold to a local resident for $950,000. On August 21, 2010, the departing owner held a moving sale at the house and hundreds of people turned up for the event. They were allowed to go inside the house, but not to visit the upstairs rooms or the basement.

<text>The Plymouth Fury is a model of automobile that was produced by Plymouth from 1955 until 1989. It was introduced for the 1956 model year as a sub-series of the Plymouth Belvedere, becoming a separate series one level above the contemporary Belvedere for 1959. The Fury was a full-size car from 1959 until 1961, then a mid-size car from 1962 until 1964, again, a full-size car from 1965 through 1974, and again, a mid-size car from 1975 through 1978. From 1975 until 1977, the Fury was sold alongside the full-size Plymouth Gran Fury. In 1978, the B-body Fury was the largest Plymouth, and by 1979, there was no large Plymouth. This product gap was filled in 1980 with the R-body Gran Fury, followed by the M-body Fury in 1982. Production of the last V8, RWD Plymouth Fury ended at the Kenosha Main assembly plant in Kenosha, WI, on December 23, 1988. Unlike its sibling brand, Dodge, Plymouth would not live to see the resurgence of the large, V8/RWD sedan. 

==Early history (1956–1958)==
The Fury was a sub-series of the Plymouth Belvedere from 1956 through 1958. It was sold only as a sandstone white two-door hardtop with gold anodized aluminum trim, in 1956 and 1957. In 1958, it was only available in buckskin beige with gold anodized aluminum trim. These Furys had special interiors, bumper wing-guards and V8 engines with twin four-barrel carburetors. The 1957 and 1958 -engine produced , shared with the Dodge Coronet.

The 1957 models were restyled; longer, wider, with very large vertical tailfins and a new torsion bar front suspension replacing the previous coil springs. While the new styling boosted sales, quality control suffered for all Chrysler products as they were brought quickly to market before their design and construction weaknesses could be fully addressed by engineering. The front suspension introduced Chrysler&#x27;s Torsion-Aire Torsion bar suspension shared with all Chrysler products starting in 1957.

In 1958, the optional engine was a &quot;big block&quot;  called the &quot;Golden Commando&quot; with two four-barrel carburetors producing . A option with fuel injection was available, but the Bendix electronic fuel-injection system was recalled by the factory and owners were given a conventional dual four-barrel setup. The Golden Commando engine was optional on any Plymouth Plaza, Savoy, Belvedere, Suburban, and Fury, as was the dual four-barrel (dubbed the &quot;V-800 Dual Fury&quot;; four- and two-barrel 318s also arrived for 1958 and were simply called &quot;V-800s&quot;). 

== First generation (1959) ==
In 1959, Plymouth introduced the Sport Fury as its top model, and the Fury as its second from the top model to replace the Plymouth Belvedere at the top of the Plymouth line-up. The Fury was now available in 4-door Sedan, 2-door Hardtop and 4-door Hardtop models and the Sport Fury as a 2-door Hardtop and a Convertible. The station wagon version of the Fury was the Sport Suburban, which was not marketed as a Fury. The Sport Fury was dropped at the end of 1959, but was reintroduced in mid-1962 and discontinued in 1971.

In 1959, the 350 was replaced with a version of the Golden Commando with a two- or four-barrel carburetor. The dual four-barrel version of the &quot;small block&quot; was also introduced that year, with the four-barrel available on this engine through the 1962 model year.

===Dodge Viscount===
The Dodge Viscount was an automobile built by Chrysler Canada for the 1959 model year only. It was based on the contemporary Plymouth Fury, but featured a 1959 Dodge front clip assembled to the Plymouth Fury body. However, there was no sport model counterpart to the Sport Fury sold in the U.S.

== Second generation (1960–1961) ==
The 1960 models were the first year for unibody construction, the first year for Chrysler&#x27;s ram induction system, and the first year for Chrysler&#x27;s new slant-six engine. The original 318 and 383 were available, along with a 361. The slant-six produced at 4,000 rpm. The 383 was rated at .

The styling for the 1960 model year had been formulated in 1957 during the height of tailfin era, but the design fell from fashion. While Chevrolet and Ford sales increased during 1960, Plymouth barely continued its 1959 volume.

Tailfins were removed for the 1961 model year.

The Fury remained Plymouth&#x27;s leading sales volume model through the early 1960s.

== Third generation (1962–1964) ==

The 1962 Fury emerged as a downsized model riding on the new Chrysler B-body unibody platform, the product of a Chrysler Corporation embroiled in multiple corporate controversies at the time. Sales of the new model were slow, prompting the reintroduction of the Sport Fury trim package, offered as a hardtop coupe or a convertible. The 1962 range included a Fury 4-door Station Wagon, the wagon equivalent of the Fury having previously been marketed as the Plymouth Sport Suburban. 

Chrysler Corporation began to restyle and enlarge the Plymouths and Dodges, which improved sales in 1963 and 1964. The 1964 models saw an improvement in sales, especially the two-door hardtop, which featured a new slanted roofline. Engine choices remained the same throughout this three-year cycle.

== Fourth generation (1965–1968) ==
In 1965, Chrysler returned the Fury to the new, full-size Chrysler C-body platform. The new 1965 Plymouth line included three special Furys: the Fury I, Fury II, and Fury III. The Fury I was the basic model, while the Fury II and Fury III offered more trim and features. Full size Furys had options such as automatic transmissions, power steering, white sidewall tires (along with full wheel covers), stereo radios, vinyl tops, and air conditioning. The Sport Fury was the highest trim and feature model, positioned to compete with the Chevrolet Impala Super Sport and Ford Galaxie 500/XL. It offered a sportier interior and exterior trim package. The Fury II was available as a two-door hardtop in Canada only; in the U.S. it was only available as a two- or four-door sedan, and as a station wagon.

The overall design changed, with the grille losing chrome but gaining two vertical stacked headlights on each side. All rode on new wheelbases ( for the wagons)— longer than before. The 426 &quot;street wedge&quot; V8 was introduced, rated at and finally street-legal.

The 1966 Furys kept the same profile as the 1965s, with a split front and rear grille motif. To complete with the new luxury-focused models such as the Ford Galaxie 500 LTD, Chevrolet Impala Caprice, and AMC Ambassador DPL, Plymouth introduced a plush, luxurious edition of the Fury, called the VIP. Available initially as a four-door hardtop in the fall of 1965, it was joined in early 1966 by a two-door hardtop. Interiors featured plush upholstery, door panels were contoured with ample woodgrain trim throughout the cabin, while the exterior got &quot;VIP&quot; emblems and fender skirts as standard. Although the car was essentially an upgraded Fury III, it was marketed as a separate model. The VIP included Chrysler&#x27;s V8 mated to a three-speed manual transmission, although the vast majority were ordered with the TorqueFlite automatic.

For 1967, the body was restyled with a sharp, angular profile. The stacked quad headlight bezels were curvier and set more deeply into the body, giving the car a more muscular look. The roofline had sharper angles and gave the car a longer, more luxurious appearance. A new, formal two-door hardtop body style appeared which featured smaller rear quarter windows and a wider, back-slanted &quot;C&quot; pillar. Called the &quot;fast top&quot;, it was offered alongside the restyled thin &quot;C&quot; pillar hardtop in both VIP and Sport Fury series (as well as on corresponding big Dodge models). The 1967 model year introduced new safety regulations, which meant that for the first time, all Plymouths included dual-circuit brake master cylinders, energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, recessed instrument panel controls, and shoulder belt mounting points for outboard front seat occupants.1967 also marked the end of the V8, replaced by the thin-wall-casting LA (lightweight A) engine, now the base V8, with wedge-shaped combustion chambers, producing more power, even though the advertised number did not change, and significant weight reduction. The 318 LA engine did not appear on export or cars sold in Canada until 1968.

The 1968 model year Furys received only minor grille updates along with side marker lights and shoulder belts for front outboard occupants (except the convertibles). At the rear, however, all models except the station wagons received new sheet metal, including reshaped rear doors on four-door models. Meanwhile, the Suburban badge returned to station wagons after having been retired in 1961. The Suburban, Custom Suburban, and Sport Suburban corresponded to the Fury I, II, and III models.

From 1966 until 1969, a luxury version of the Fury called the &quot;Plymouth VIP&quot; (marketed as the &quot;very important Plymouth&quot; in 1966) was fielded, in response to the Ford LTD, Chevrolet Caprice, and the AMC Ambassador DPL. These models came with standards such as full wheel covers, vinyl tops, luxuriously upholstered interiors with walnut dashboards and door-panel trim, a thicker grade of carpeting, more sound insulation, and full courtesy lighting.

In Australia, the full-size Dodge Phoenix was based on the Dodge Dart and the 440 until 1965, when it became a right-hand drive version of the contemporary Fury. The Phoenix continued in production in Australia until 1972, each based on that year&#x27;s North American Plymouth Fury.

== Fifth generation (1969–1973) ==
The 1969 Fury received a partial facelift, and was again available as a 2-door hardtop, 2-door convertible, 4-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 4-door station wagon. For 1970, the VIP was discontinued and a 4-door hardtop was added to the Sport Fury range, which also gained a new hardtop coupe. This was available in &quot;GT&quot; trim; the 1970 and 1971 Sport Fury GTs were powered by the engine, which in 1970 could be ordered with three 2-barrel (twin-choke) carburetors (the &quot;6-Barrel on Plymouth and 6-PAK for Dodge&quot;) producing 390 hp and 490 ft-lbs of torque. The base model engine produced .

The 1969 models included the Fury I, Fury II, and Fury III, the sport-model Sport Fury, and the top-line VIP. The 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine continued as standard on the Fury I, II, and select III models, with the V8 standard on the Sport Fury, some Fury III models, and all VIP models plus the station wagon. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission optional. The six-cylinder engine/three-speed manual transmission power team – along with the three-speed manual transmission on the V8 – continued to be available until midway through the 1971 model year, after which all full-sized Plymouths were built with a V8 engine, including the new 360 cubic inch engine and automatic transmission. Parking lights now illuminated with the headlights, which meant that if one headlight was inoperative in low beam, oncoming drivers would not mistake the car for a motorcycle in the dark.

For 1970 model year the Fury fully gained Chrysler&#x27;s round-sided &quot;Fuselage Look&quot; styling, a year later than the lead models featuring it. The VIP model was dropped, with the Sport Fury line expanded to include a four-door hardtop sedan. An optional Brougham package, which included individually-adjustable split bench seats with passenger recliner and luxurious trim comparable to the former VIP series, was available on Sport Furys; a Sport Fury GT and S/23 models. The S/23 was dropped for 1971, with new options including an electric sunroof (for top-line models) and a stereo tape player with a microphone, making it possible to record off the radio or take dictation.

The 1971 model year offered a new Sport Fury 4-door sedan and a 2-door sedan (similar to the Sport Fury hardtop but with fixed rear quarter windows) in the Fury I series. A hardtop coupe was now available in the Fury II series, and a Formal Hardtop was available for both Sport Fury and Fury III. New options included headlight washers and a stereo cassette recorder. The LA 360 cubic engine was introduced, the largest production &quot;smallblock&quot; V8 built by Chrysler Corporation. A new Fury Custom model came out in May and was priced between the Fury I and II. 

For 1972, the Fury was facelifted with a large chrome twin-loop bumper design with a small insignia space between the loops and hidden headlamps as standard equipment on the Sport Suburban, and the newly introduced Fury Gran Coupe and Gran Sedan, which eventually would become the Plymouth Gran Fury; the Sport Fury and GT models were dropped, while the new Fury Gran series offered an optional Brougham package. The six-cylinder engine, strangled by emissions requirements, was no longer offered in full-size Plymouths. On the other hand, a 400 cubic inch V8 was now an option. For 1973, the front end was redesigned with a new grille and headlamp setup, along with bumpers capable of withstanding impacts. The 360 became the standard engine for Fury Suburbans.

== Sixth generation (1974) ==
For 1974 model year the Fury shared Chrysler&#x27;s all-new full-size C-body platform in common with the concurrent flagship Chrysler Imperial (1974-75); New Yorker (1974-78), Newport (1974-78) and Town &amp; Country (1974-77); and with the Dodge Monaco (1974-76) and Royal Monaco (1977). Styling was more squared off with lower beltlines and greater use of glass than with Chrysler&#x27;s previous fuselage generation (1969-73), also with cues more similar to the model year 1971 and later GM &quot;B&quot; bodies and model year 1973–74 Mercurys. The unibody structure with subframe for engine/transmission was retained along with other typical Chrysler Corporation engineering features including torsion bar front suspension and asymmetrical multi-leaf springs in the rear.
Model lineup again included the Fury I, Fury II, Fury III and Gran Fury series, plus the Suburban and Sport Suburban station wagons. Engine offerings included a standard V8 with two-barrel carburetor on sedans and coupes, a two-barrel V8 standard on wagons and optional on other models, and four-barrel carbureted 400 and V8s optional on all models.

All 1974 Furys came standard with TorqueFlite automatic transmissions, power steering, and power front disc brakes.

As part of the company&#x27;s efforts to make ordering a well-equipped car easier, two special model packages were available: a basic group (which had items already ordered on a majority of full-sized Plymouths, such as an AM radio, air conditioning, light group and tinted glass) and a luxury group (which added items such as cruise control, power windows and an AM/FM stereo radio). The Brougham package, whose centerpiece was the individually-adjustable 50/50 divided front seat with individual center armrests and recliners, was still available for Gran Furys. New options included Chrysler&#x27;s chronometer (an electronic digital clock), a gauge alert system that used light-emitting diodes to monitor engine functions and automatic temperature control.

== Seventh generation (1975–1978) ==
For the 1975 model year, Chrysler moved the Fury name, which had been part of the full-size C-body Plymouth model line up during the previous ten model years, over to the restyled mid-size B-body line, which had been marketed as the Satellite previously. The &quot;Road Runner&quot; was offered as the top-of-the-line model of the redesigned Plymouth Fury 2-door line up, then it was moved over to the Plymouth Volare line up during the following model year (1976). The full-size Plymouth, now known as the Plymouth Gran Fury, lasted through 1977. The entire mid-size Plymouth Fury line up was discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year, replaced in Canada by the rebadged Dodge Diplomat model called the Plymouth Caravelle (not to be confused with the E-body Plymouth Caravelle from 1983 until 1988 and also the 1985 through 1988 Plymouth Caravelle for the American car market). During the entire 1979 model year, there were no Fury models marketed by Plymouth.

Only minor styling changes occurred from the 1975 through the 1978 model years, most notably, during the 1977 model year when quad stacked square headlights (see photo) replaced the previous round dual beam headlights, the front turn signals, previously on the outboard edges of the grille, were moved over to the cutouts in the front bumper. Tail lights received amber turn signal lenses in place of the previous red turn signal lenses. Various 2-door models had no centerposts and some of them were true hardtops with roll-down rear windows. Other two-door models had fixed rear windows even though they had no centerposts. For the most part, the Plymouth Fury two-door models, during the 1975 and 1978 model years, were labeled as &quot;hardtops&quot;.

The Plymouth Fury, 1975-1978, shared its B-body and unibody structure with the Dodge Coronet (1975-1976), Dodge Monaco (1977-1978) and the corporation&#x27;s new personal-luxury coupe models, Chrysler Cordoba (1975-1979) and Dodge Charger SE (1975-1978). All the four-door models, wagons and sedans, continued with the basic body shells that were introduced for the 1971 model year, rode on a wheelbase, while the various two-door models—which were restyled with new and more formal sheetmetal and rooflines—rode on the wheelbase.

Before 1975, the Plymouth Satellite had a wheelbase, while the Dodge Coronet had a wheelbase. For 1975, the mid-size Plymouth Fury had a wheelbase and the 1975 Dodge Coronet had the same wheelbase.

Before 1974, the Plymouth Fury had a wheelbase, while the Dodge Monaco/Polara had a wheelbase. For 1974, the Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Monaco had the same wheelbase.

Fury was offered in three basic subseries for 1975 in sedans and coupes and two for the station wagon. The sedan was offered in base, custom and salon models, with interior and exterior trim ranging from austere to luxurious. The salon featured plush velour bench seats with recliners and folding armrests and carpeted trunks, along with a spring-loaded hood ornament with the Plymouth logo. In addition to the Road Runner, the Fury coupes were offered in base, Custom and Sport models. The &quot;sport&quot; was the top-line coupe featuring body pinstriping on the upper door and front and rear fenders, interiors with all-vinyl bucket seats and center cushion and armrest, or optional center console; or split bench seats with armrest, along with plusher shag carpeting on floor and door panels plus lower door carpeting. The wagons were available as either the Fury Suburban or Fury Custom Suburban.

Engine offerings included the slant-six that was standard on all models except Fury Sport, Road Runner, and station wagons, which came with the V8 as the base engine which was optional on other models. Optional engines on all models included and V8s with two- or four-barrel carburetor, and the four-barrel was only as a &quot;police&quot; option on four-door sedans. A three-speed manual transmission was standard with the automatic TorqueFlite optional.

The 1976 model year mid-size B-body 1976 Plymouth Fury saw very few appearance changes from the previous year other than the availability of a dual opera window roof on Sport Fury two-door models. Engine and transmission offerings were also unchanged except that the 360 two-barrel V8 was now the standard engine on station wagons along with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission, both items of which were optional on other models.
The 1977 model year mid-size B-body 1977 Plymouth Fury received a new front end with a chrome vertical bar grille and outline along with stacked rectangular headlights. Model and drivetrain offerings were unchanged from 1976 except that the Slant Six now had two-barrel carburetion replacing the one-barrel pot of previous years and was now standard on the Sport Fury two-door models. Optional V8 engines included the 318 two-barrel, 360 two- or four-barrel and 400 two- or four-barrel. The 440 four-barrel V8 was only offered in four-door models as part of the police package.

The 1978 model year was technically a mid-size B-body car, but the 1978 Plymouth Fury was Plymouth&#x27;s largest car with the discontinuation of the full-size C-body Plymouth Gran Fury after 1977. TorqueFlite automatic transmission and power steering were now standard on all Fury models and the same selection of V8 engines was still available. Few appearance changes were made from the previous model year. The 1978 was the last model year for the Plymouth Fury and its Dodge Monaco counterpart, which was renamed as such during the start of the previous model year (1977), which, in turn, was called the &quot;Dodge Coronet&quot; (1965, 1966, and 1967, from 1968 until 1974, and from 1975 through 1976), while the former full-size C-body Dodge was renamed the &quot;Dodge Royal Monaco&quot; during the start of the previous model year (1977) up until it was discontinued after just one model year. The personal-luxury coupes, which were based on the mid-size B-body platform, including the Chrysler Cordoba and Dodge Magnum (renamed from Charger in 1978) would soldier on for one more year until they were downsized (and renamed Mirada for the Dodge version) in 1980 to the M-body platform used for the Dodge Diplomat and Chrysler LeBaron.

==Gran Fury==
===1980–1981===

For 1980, Chrysler&#x27;s venerable B-body chassis/unibody structure was reengineered and restyled into the new R-body full-sized car, which was a considerably downsized replacement of the 1974–78 C-body cars. The R-body included the 1979-1981 Chrysler Newport, Chrysler New Yorker, and Dodge St. Regis 
The 1980-1981 R-body Gran Fury, although not common in retail sales, did quite well in fleet and government/public safety sales.

===1982–1989===
After Chrysler discontinued the R-body halfway through the 1981 model year, they decided to anoint the M-body platform with &quot;full-size&quot; status for 1982. The New Yorker and Gran Fury nameplates were thus assigned to the former LeBaron and Canadian Caravelle models, respectively, for the US market. The Chrysler New Yorker (1982) and New Yorker Fifth Avenue (1983) (renamed Chrysler Fifth Avenue for 1984) shared the Gran Fury and Dodge Diplomat body.

The M-body cars were available through the 1989 model year, and the Gran Fury and Diplomat were very popular choices for police cruisers. Chrysler discontinued the M-body (and L-body) cars in late 1988, midway through the 1989 model year. That brought over 30 years of Plymouth Fury history to an end.
==In popular culture==
A 1958 Plymouth Fury was the title subject of the 1983 best-selling novel &quot;Christine&quot; by Stephen King. Later in the same year the book was adapted into a movie of the same name directed by John Carpenter. The car, or another very like it (actual Furys were not available in red in 1958), appears mysteriously near the end of the narrative of King&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;It&quot;.

In the television series &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; (S3:E33, &quot;Beaver and Violet&quot;), character Fred Rutherford&#x27;s 1960 convertible Fury is prominently seen (Plymouth was a sponsor of the show).

<text>CSS &quot;Nashville&quot; was a brig-rigged, side-paddle-wheel passenger steamer that served with the Confederate Navy during the Civil War.

==History==
Originally a United States Mail Service ship, the USMS &quot;Nashville&quot; was built at Greenpoint, Brooklyn in 1853. Between 1853 and 1861 she was engaged in running between New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. During the Battle of Fort Sumter, the USMS &quot;Nashville&quot; sailed into Charleston without flying the US national standard and was fired upon by the USRC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; which marked the first shot of the naval war in the Civil War. The &quot;Nashville&quot; raised the American flag, and after the surrender of Sumter, the &quot;Nashville&quot; docked at Charleston.

After the fall of Fort Sumter, the Confederates captured her at Charleston and fitted her out as a cruiser. Under the command of Lieutenant Robert B. Pegram, CSN, she ran the blockade on October 21, 1861, and headed across the Atlantic to Southampton, England, the first ship of war to fly the Confederate flag in English waters. On November 19, 1861, near the British Isles, she boarded and burned an American merchant ship, the &quot;Harvey Birch&quot;, the first such action by a Confederate commerce raider in the North Atlantic during the war.

&quot;Nashville&quot; returned to Beaufort, North Carolina on February 28, 1862, having captured two prizes worth US$66,000 during the cruise. In this interval she was sold for use as a blockade runner and renamed &quot;Thomas L. Wragg&quot;.

On November 5, 1862, she was commissioned as the privateer &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. After she ran fast aground on the Ogeechee River, Georgia, the monitor destroyed her with shell fire from 11-inch (279-mm) and 15-inch (381-mm) turret guns on February 28, 1863.

British writer Francis Warrington Dawson (born Austin John Reeks), then a youth of 21, joined the crew of the &quot;Nashville&quot; in 1862 in order to make passage from Britain to the Confederacy, with whose cause he sympathized. He later wrote a book about his experience as an expatriate Briton in the Confederacy, &quot;Reminiscences of Confederate Service, 1861-1865&quot;, the first seven chapters of which detail his observations and experiences aboard the &quot;Nashville&quot;.

<doc id="1189721" wikidata="Q643753" url="?curid=1189721" title="They Live by Night">
<text>They Live by Night is a 1948 American film noir directed by Nicholas Ray in his directorial debut and starring Cathy O&#x27;Donnell and Farley Granger. Based on Edward Anderson&#x27;s Depression-era novel &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, the film follows a young fugitive who falls in love with a woman and attempts to begin a life with her.

The film opened theatrically in London in August 1948 under the title &quot;The Twisted Road&quot; and was released in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures as &quot;They Live by Night&quot; in November 1949. Although the film received favorable reviews from film critics, it was a box-office failure, losing the studio $445,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

Although the film is widely considered as the prototype for the &quot;couple on the run&quot; genre and the forerunner to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), the story was first depicted in Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;, starring Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney. Director Jim Jarmusch cites the film as one of the influences on no wave cinema and his work in general. Robert Altman directed another adaptation of the novel in 1974 using the original title of the novel, &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;.

==Plot==
Arthur &quot;Bowie&quot; Bowers, a 23-year-old serving a prison sentence for a murder he committed at the age of 16, escapes from prison with two older bank robbers, Chicamaw and T-Dub. The men take shelter with Chicamaw&#x27;s brother, who operates a service station, and niece Catherine &quot;Keechie&quot; Mobley, who works there. Hoping to also free his incarcerated brother Robert, T-Dub concocts a plan to rob a bank and use the funds to hire a lawyer to prove a wrongful conviction.

The robbery goes smoothly. However, shortly after Bowie crashes his car, Chicamaw kills a police officer who had arrived at the scene. Chicamaw leaves an injured Bowie in the care of Keechie and joins T-Dub in another town. The sheepish Keechie swiftly grows fond of Bowie, who is also shy. They bond over their lack of experience in the world and soon develop a romance. Meanwhile, the press reports heavily on Bowie, wrongly pinning him as the ringleader of the robbery. Bowie and Keechie leave town by bus. Late one night, they find a chapel that performs quick marriages for $20. Bowie asks Keechie to marry him, and she agrees. Hawkins, the local justice of the peace, performs the ceremony and sells the couple a convertible car.

Bowie and Keechie travel to a remote mountain resort where Keechie once stayed during her childhood and rent a cabin there, dreaming of living openly together. Chicamaw arrives at the resort after tracking the couple there. He has gambled away his money and wants Bowie to help him and T-Dub commit another robbery. Bowie reluctantly agrees, but Keechie, fearing that Bowie will be killed, gives him his Christmas gift early, a wristwatch. The three men commit another robbery, but T-Dub is killed. Bowie and Chicamaw flee the scene by car. While driving, Bowie learns from a drunken Chicamaw that he is jealous of all the press attention that Bowie and Keechie have received. Bowie eventually forces Chicamaw out of the car at gunpoint.

When Bowie returns to the resort, he learns that Chicamaw was killed in a liquor-store robbery. In radio broadcasts, Bowie is again described as the ringleader of the robbery. Keechie reveals that she is pregnant. The couple depart the resort and head east, traveling mainly at night to not be seen. However, they spend a leisurely time in public, visiting a park and then a nightclub. In the club, Bowie is recognized by a gangster who orders him to leave town. Bowie suggests escaping to Mexico, and Keechie agrees.

Keechie becomes very ill, and they seek refuge at a motel owned by Mattie, T-Dub&#x27;s sister-in-law. Mattie reluctantly allows them to stay. Bowie visits Hawkins, seeking help to cross the border, but Mattie reluctantly strikes a deal with police to identify Bowie&#x27;s location in exchange for the release of her convicted husband Robert. Hawkins tells Bowie that he is unable to help him, and Bowie returns to the motel and informs Mattie that he will leave by himself to ensure the safety of Keechie and their unborn child. Mattie is wracked with guilt over her deal with the police but urges that Bowie say a final goodbye to Keechie, hoping to delay him long enough for the police to arrive. He agrees and writes a farewell letter to bring to Keechie. As he is about to enter the cabin, police descend on the scene, provoking Bowie to draw a gun. In response, the police fire, killing Bowie. Keechie, kneeling over Bowie&#x27;s dead body, reads the farewell letter.

==Production==
===Development===
The novel &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; by Edward Anderson had been acquired by RKO in 1941 for $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Numerous writers unsuccessfully tried to adapt the story as a screenplay. According to producer John Houseman, &quot;I found the book and gave it to Nick to read, and he fell madly in love with it–as indeed I did, but Nick particularly was very familiar with that territory. He&#x27;d been there when he worked with the Lomaxes, he&#x27;d been there when he worked for the Department of Agriculture, and so on. And that whole Depression stuff was terribly his stuff. So he sat down and wrote the treatment. I&#x27;d come home at night and we&#x27;d go over it; I&#x27;d edit it a little, that&#x27;s all, and it was very, very good.&quot; Houseman, who had considerable authority as a producer, repeatedly submitted treatments created by novice director Nicholas Ray.

RKO saw no commercial value in the story, especially because Ray lacked experience as a director. In early 1947, producer Dore Schary became RKO&#x27;s production chief, hoping to transform it into Hollywood&#x27;s most adventurous studio. Schary read Ray&#x27;s treatment and signed Ray to a studio contract.

Houseman hired Charles Schnee to write the screenplay, but Houseman did not want Schnee to alter Ray&#x27;s treatment. Ray and Schnee worked together to adapt the treatment into a completed script, which was submitted to RKO in May 1947.

===Casting===
Houseman arranged for Farley Granger to test for RKO, and Ray was convinced that he had found Bowie. Granger suggested Cathy O&#x27;Donnell for the female lead part. Both Granger and O&#x27;Donnell were under contract to Samuel Goldwyn and had limited acting experience. Granger had appeared in just two films before his World War II service, while O&#x27;Donnell had just made the classic &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). Ray insisted on the casting of Granger and O&#x27;Donnell. Granger later said: &quot;Ray and John Houseman were among the few people who fought for me in my career. They said no, we will not make the film without him. When Nick believed in you, he was very loyal.&quot; In his autobiography, Granger listed &quot;They Live by Night&quot; among his favorite films.

Many of the supporting cast and minor characters were played by friends of Houseman and Ray. RKO contract player Robert Mitchum wanted the part of Chicamaw, but as he was a rising star who had recently received an Oscar nomination, RKO deemed the role of a bank robber unfit for him. The role of Chicamaw went to Howard Da Silva, who had made an impression in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1937), produced by Houseman. Other minor roles were played by people whom Ray knew from the New York theater, including Marie Bryant from &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Holiday&quot; as a nightclub singer, Curt Conway and Will Lee, who would later play Mr. Hooper on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming began on June 23, 1947, with the opening scene, a tracking shot of Bowie, T-Dub and Chickamaw escaping from prison in a stolen car. The action sequence was filmed from a helicopter, making &quot;They Live by Night&quot; the first major studio production to do so, predating James Wong Howe&#x27;s celebrated final helicopter shot in &quot;Picnic&quot; by eight years. Four takes were required, and the second take was used in the final cut.

As Orson Welles had done in his directorial debut, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), also made at RKO for Houseman, Ray experimented with sound and cinematography. Ray&#x27;s biographer noted: &quot;Only Welles similarly tried to define acoustic and even verbal textures as much as the visual.&quot; Renowned film editor Sherman Todd also urged Ray to experiment and defy convention. Exteriors were filmed both on location and at RKO&#x27;s movie ranch in Encino, but Todd&#x27;s editing blended the sequences well.

Filming completed on August 21, 1947. Despite an excellent preview, RKO was unsure about how to market the film and studio head Howard Hughes shelved it for two years before releasing it to a single theater in the UK to enthusiastic reviews. The film was finally released in the U.S. in November 1949 under the title &quot;They Live by Night&quot; rather than the source novel&#x27;s title of &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;. The title was determined by audience poll and was favored by Hughes.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film recorded a loss of $445,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

===Critical response===
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called &quot;They Live by Night&quot; a &quot;commonplace little story&quot; and wrote: &quot;Although it—like others—is misguided in its sympathies for a youthful crook, this crime-and-compassion melodrama has the virtues of vigor and restraint ... &#x27;They Live by Night&#x27; has the failing of waxing sentimental over crime, but it manages to generate interest with its crisp dramatic movement and clear-cut types.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was issued on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection in August 2017.

<text>James Kirke Paulding (August 22, 1778 – April 6, 1860) was an American writer and, for a time, the United States Secretary of the Navy. Paulding&#x27;s early writings were satirical and violently anti-British, as shown in &quot;The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan&quot; (1812). He wrote numerous long poems and serious histories. Among his novels are &quot;Konigsmarke, the Long Finne&quot; (1823) and &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Fireside&quot; (1831). He is best known for creating the inimitable Nimrod Wildfire, the &quot;half horse, half alligator&quot; in &quot;The Lion of the West&quot; (1831), and as collaborator with William Irving and Washington Irving in &quot;Salmagundi.&quot; (1807–08). Paulding was also, by the mid-1830s, an ardent and outspoken defender of slavery, and he later endorsed southern secession from the union.

==Biography==
James Kirke Paulding was born on August 22, 1778, at Pleasant Valley, Dutchess County, New York. His parents were William Paulding and Catherine Ogden. Paulding was chiefly self-educated.

He became a close friend of Washington Irving. With Irving, Paulding proposed a literary project. As he described, &quot;one day in a frolicsome mood, we broached the idea of a little periodical merely for our own amusement, and that of the town, for neither of us anticipated any further circulation.&quot; The result was &quot;Salmagundi; &quot;a short-lived satirical periodical, from which the word &#x27;Gotham&#x27; was first ascribed as a name for New York City.

Along with Irving, Paulding was associated with the &quot;Knickerbocker Group&quot;, a group which also included William Cullen Bryant, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Joseph Rodman Drake, Robert Charles Sands, Lydia Maria Child, and Nathaniel Parker Willis.

Paulding&#x27;s other writings also include &quot;The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan&quot; (1812), a satire, &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Fireside&quot; (1831), a romance which attained popularity, &quot;A&quot; &quot;Life of Washington&quot; (1835), and some poems. Extracts from his epic poem &quot;The Backwoodsman&quot; (1818) were popularly reprinted throughout his life. In the decade before Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper achieved popular success, Paulding experimented in every genre in an effort to forge a new American literature. Thereafter, his outstanding contributions were in the novel and in a stage comedy. &quot;Koningsmarke&quot; (1823), which he began as a spoof of Walter Scott&#x27;s historical romances, took unexpected hold of his imagination and became a well-turned novel, notable for its portrait of an old black woman that anticipates William Faulkner and for its sympathetic yet unromanticized depiction of the Indian. &quot;The Lion of the West&quot; (1831), selected in a play competition in which William Cullen Bryant was one of the judges, presented a cartoon of Davy Crockett; it was the most-often performed play on the American stage before &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and an altered version enjoyed success in London. Paulding&#x27;s &quot;View of Slavery in the United States&quot; (1836) was a comprehensive defense of both Black slavery and America&#x27;s claim to be a bastion of liberty against the attacks of abolitionists and European critics. Writer and critic John Neal in his 1824–25 critical work &quot;American Writers&quot; dubbed Paulding one of only three authors (along with himself and Charles Brockden Brown) to exhibit an authentically American style.

Among Paulding&#x27;s government positions were those of secretary to the Board of Navy Commissioners in 1815–23 and Naval Agent in New York in 1824–38. President Martin Van Buren appointed him Secretary of the Navy in June 1838. As Secretary, he was a conservative figure, whose extensive knowledge of naval affairs was balanced by notable lack of enthusiasm for new technology. He opposed the introduction of steam-propelled warships declaring that he would &quot;never consent to let our old ships perish, and transform our Navy into a fleet of (steam) sea monsters.&quot; Nevertheless, his tenure was marked by advances in steam engineering, wide-ranging exploration efforts, enlargement of the fleet and an expansion of the Navy&#x27;s apprenticeship program.

In 1839, Paulding was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Paulding left office with the change of administrations in March 1841, returned to literary pursuits and took up agriculture. He died at his farm near Hyde Park, New York. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

USS &quot;James K. Paulding&quot; (DD-238) was named in honor of Secretary of the Navy Paulding.

== Personal life ==
Paulding married Gertrude Kemble (d. 1841) on 15 November 1818. Gertrude was the daughter of New York merchant Peter Kemble and the sister of U.S. congressman Gouverneur Kemble. They had four sons:

* Peter Kemble Paulding (1819–1900)
* William Irving Paulding (1825–1890)
* Gouverneur Paulding (1829–1913)
* James Nathaniel Paulding (1833–1898)

== Oft-quoted phrase ==
Paulding&#x27;s story, &quot;The Politician&quot; contains a maxim that is often attributed to Samuel Gompers: &quot;Reward your friends and punish your enemies.&quot; The story appears in his collection, &quot;Tales of the Good Woman, by a Doubtful Gentleman.&quot; The same basic idea (a definition of justice as doing good to friends and harm to enemies), appears in Plato&#x27;s dialogue, the &quot;Republic&quot;, where it is subsequently rejected as inadequate.

<text>The flamecrest (Regulus goodfellowi), also known as Taiwan firecrest, is a species of bird in the kinglet family, Regulidae. It is endemic to the mountains of Taiwan.

==Description==
The flamecrest is a small perching bird, resembling a warbler. Its length is only and weight about 7 g, making it the smallest of all Taiwan&#x27;s endemic bird species, and the smallest and most colourful member of its family in the world.

The top of its head is yellow and orange, with black crown stripes. White feathers encircling the black eye-patches give it the appearance of having two black eyes. The most distinguishing characteristic is the orange-yellow crest on top of the head, for which it is named. Females have the crown stripe pure yellow while males have an orange centre to it. When excited the male erects the crest. The supercilium is very broad and the lores and forehead are whitish. There is a narrow short black malar stripe. The chin is whitish and the throat, ear-coverts and sides of neck are grey. The mantle is green while the rump and flanks are yellow. The centre of the belly is buff. The wings have broad white covert tips forming a wing bar. The tarsi are pinkish. They have a high-pitched &quot;see-see-see&quot; call and the song consists of a series of high notes.

==Taxonomy==
The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers. The names of the family Regulidae, and the genus &quot;Regulus&quot;, are derived from the Latin &quot;regulus&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;rex&quot;, &quot;a king&quot;, and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The Taiwan Firecrest was formally described by Scottish ornithologist William Ogilvie-Grant in 1906 from the writings of English explorer and ornithologist, Walter Goodfellow, who is commemorated in the binomial name.

The flamecrest has sometimes been viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data shows that it is closely related to that species, and only distantly to the firecrest. The flamecrest lineage diverged from that of the goldcrest 3.0–3.1 mya.

==Distribution and habitat==
It usually inhabits evergreen trees in coniferous forests over 2,000 m above sea level, though it is commonest above 2,500 m and ranges upward to 3,700 m. Mountains it inhabits include Alishan, Da Yu Ling, Hehuanshan, Yu Shan, and the higher areas of Anmashan. They prefer conifers in which to forage, and are usually found in the forest canopy, but will sometimes venture into lower vegetation.

An analysis of the distribution of Taiwan&#x27;s 17 endemic bird species, using data from bird surveys conducted from 1993 to 2004, classified the firecrest as uncommon (along with the Formosan magpie, Taiwan bush warbler, yellow tit and Taiwan barwing). It found that the flamecrest occurred in high- and mid-altitude coniferous forests, and in high-altitude broad-leaved mixed forests, mainly at 2000–3600 m above sea level. The sites where it was recorded had an average altitude of about 2550 m, the highest of all the endemic birds. Its habitats had the coldest mean temperature and lowest warmth index of all 17 endemics, as well as the highest annual rainfall for the five uncommon species, though its distribution regarding vegetation and human disturbance was similar to those of the others.

==Behaviour==
Flamecrests are active and restless birds, hopping and fluttering about in the canopy. These lively songbirds are mainly solitary but will move around actively in small, loose flocks of their own species as well as with coal tits and Eurasian nuthatches. The flight is weak and whirring. Their breeding biology is poorly known.

===Feeding===
The flamecrest is primarily an insectivore. The birds may be seen feeding on insects and their larvae on the branches and leaf sheathes of trees in coniferous forests, hovering and gleaning from leaf to stem. Weeds and berries may be taken occasionally. A study of the foraging ecology of alpine forest birds on conifers in the Taroko National Park found that, when compared with Eurasian nuthatches, coal tits, green-backed tits and black-throated tits, flamecrests were the most generalised foragers, utilising almost all of the crown of a tree, rather than specialising in parts of it as with the other species, with which it associates in mixed-species foraging flocks during the non-breeding season.

===Voice===
Flamecrests have fine, shrill and high-pitched calls, &quot;zi zi yi&quot;. Although noisy at close range, the voice is soft and does not carry far.

<doc id="1189729" wikidata="Q842582" url="?curid=1189729" title="Dhuhr (prayer)">
<text>Dhuhr, () also transliterated as Zuhr, Duhr or Thuhr is one of the five daily mandatory Islamic prayers (&quot;salah&quot;). It is observed after Fajr and before Asr, between the zenith of noon and sunset, and contains 4 &quot;rak&#x27;a&quot; (units). 

On Friday, the Zuhr prayer is replaced or preceded by Friday prayer (&quot;jum&#x27;a&quot;) which is obligatory for Muslim men who are above the age of puberty and meet certain requirements to pray in congregation either in a mosque or with a group of Muslims. The sermon is delivered by the imam.

== Performance ==
The Dhuhr prayer consists of four compulsory (fardh) rak&#x27;a. In addition, there is a voluntary Sunnah prayer, although the details of it vary by branch of Islam. In Dhuhr, Al-Fatiha and the additional surah are to be read quietly or in a whisper (&quot;israr&quot;). 

The Hanafi school believes there are four rak&#x27;a before the compulsory prayer and two rak&#x27;a after the compulsory prayer of confirmed sunnah (sunnah mu&#x27;akkadah) prayer. The Hanafi school also believes there are 4 rak&#x27;a of non-confirmed sunnah (ghair mu&#x27;akkadah) prayer after the compulsory prayer. The Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools believe there are two rak&#x27;a of confirmed sunnah prayer before the compulsory prayer, and two additional rak&#x27;a before and after the compulsory prayer as non-confirmed sunnah prayer. In the Maliki school, there is confirmed sunnah prayer before and after the compulsory prayer. There is no limit to the amount of rak&#x27;a for these, but it is recommended (mustahabb) for it to be at least two rak&#x27;a, and it is better to pray four rak&#x27;a.

== Textual references ==

=== Quran ===

Quran 17:18 mentions &quot;the prayer from the decline of the sun&quot;, referencing Dhuhr:Some argue that Quran 2:238&#x27;s &quot;middle prayer&quot; is about Dhuhr. However the predominant view amongst scholars is that it refers to Asr.

=== Hadith ===
Some ahadith claim there are benefits to Dhuhr:

<doc id="1189731" wikidata="Q5078965" url="?curid=1189731" title="Charles Henry Pearson">
<text>Charles Henry Pearson (7 September 1830 – 29 May 1894) was a British-born Australian historian, educationist, politician and journalist. According to John Tregenza, &quot;Pearson was the outstanding intellectual of the Australian colonies. A democrat by conviction, he combined a Puritan determination in carrying reforms with a gentle manner and a scrupulous respect for the traditional rules and courtesies of public debate.&quot;

==Early life==

Pearson was born at Islington, London, fourth son (and tenth child) of the Rev. John Norman Pearson, M.A., then principal of the Church Missionary College, Islington, and Harriet &quot;née&quot; Puller. 
He was a younger brother of Sir John Pearson, QC.

Pearson spent his early childhood in Islington and Tunbridge Wells and was home educated until he went to Rugby School at the age of 13, where at first did well. Later on, coming into conflict with one of the masters, he was withdrawn by his father and sent first to a private tutor and then to King&#x27;s College London, where he came under the influence of John Sherren Brewer and Frederick Denison Maurice. In 1849, he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford. Not enjoying teaching, he devoted most of his energy to the Oxford Union, of which he was elected president in 1852–53, and was associated with some of the most distinguished men of his period. Pearson began to study medicine but, two years later, had a serious attack of pleurisy while on holiday in Ireland and so discontinued his studies because medical life was considered arduous.
===Academic career===
In 1855, Pearson became lecturer in English language and literature at King&#x27;s College, London, and shortly afterward was given the professorship in modern history. The salary was not large, and Pearson did a good deal of writing for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;the Spectator&quot;, and other London weekly reviews. In 1862, he was editor of &quot;the National Review&quot; for a year. He travelled in Russia in 1858 and in 1863 spent some time in Poland. In 1864, as a result of ill health and depressed by his failure to be appointed Oxford University&#x27;s inaugural Chichele Professor of Modern History and his low salary at King&#x27;s College, he took a year off in South Australia. He attempted to establish a 640 acres (259 ha) sheep station near Mount Remarkable but was beaten by severe drought and returned to England.

Pearson continued working on his &quot;History of England during the Early and Middle Ages&quot;, an able work begun in 1861 and published in 1868. During a trip to the United States, in contrast with the earlier views of Charles Dickens and others, he found &quot;the well-bred American is generally pleasanter than a well-bred Englishman... I agree in an observation made to me by an Englishman that the American&#x27;s great advantage over the Englishman is his greater modesty.&quot; On his return, he devoted himself to what he regarded &quot;as the best piece of historical work I have done, my maps of England in the first 13 centuries.&quot; It was eventually published in 1870.

In 1869, he became lecturer on modern history at Trinity College, Cambridge, but found the work unsatisfactory:

His father had died some years before and he lost his mother in February 1871. Shortly afterwards, partly as a result of eyestrain and a lack of good students, he decided to return to Australia and combine a light literary life with farming. He arrived in South Australia in December 1871.

==Move to Australia==
Pearson enjoyed the next three years on his farm at Haverhill, revelled in the hot, dry conditions, which suited his constitution, and hoped to obtain a professorship in the new University of Adelaide. He married in December 1872 Edith Lucille, daughter of Philip Butler of Tickford Abbey, Buckinghamshire, and cousin of Sir Richard Butler; unfortunately, her health gave way and she became very ill and, greatly to their regret, they had to give up their bush home. Pearson then accepted a position as lecturer in history at the University of Melbourne. His salary was not high, and he decided to augment it by writing for the press. &quot;The Argus&quot; rejected his articles as being too radical, but &quot;The Age&quot; began to accept them, and he became a valued contributor. The university did not allow him to pick his own textbooks or plan his courses. On 4 June 1874, and he created a university debating club, which recruited Alexander Sutherland, Alfred Deakin, William Shiels, H. B. Higgins and Theodore Fink.

Pearson found, however, that his position at the university was not satisfactory and decided to accept the position of headmaster of the newly
-formed Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College at a much-increased salary. He was greatly interested in his new work, but after two and a half years, from 1875 to 1877, a section of the governing body objected to his views on the land question. He had advocated a progressive land tax in a public lecture and thus incurred the wrath of the moneyed interests, which all that supported the school, and Pearson decided to resign.

==Political career==
The newly founded National Reform and Protection League of the period felt that here might be a valuable recruit and pressed Pearson to stand for parliament. He was afraid that his health would not stand the strain but accepted nomination for the difficult seat of Boroondara and was narrowly defeated. In May 1877, the Graham Berry government commissioned him to inquire into the state of education in the colony and the means of improving it. The report for which he received a fee of £1000 was completed in 1878. It was a valuable document, especially as he was the first to advocate the establishing of high schools to make a ladder for able children from the primary schools to university. This found little favour at the time, and more than 30 years passed before that part of his scheme was fully developed. Another valuable part of the report dealt with technical education and foreshadowed the many technical schools since established in the state of Victoria.

On 7 June 1878, Pearson was returned as one of the members for Castlemaine in the Victorian Legislative Assembly and thus began his political career. Almost immediately, he was plunged into the quarrel between the Assembly and the Legislative Council that had arisen over Premier Berry&#x27;s appropriation bill. The government determined to try to obtain the consent of the home authorities to the limiting of the rights of the council. In December 1878, Pearson was appointed a commissioner to proceed to London with the Berry bill. The mission was not successful, the feeling being in that it was the business of both houses to settle questions of this kind themselves. On 3 August 1880, Pearson became minister without salary or portfolio. On 4 July 1881, he declined the offer of Agent-General in London, and as he believed that the administration was doomed, and on 9 July, the cabinet resigned.

Pearson was elected to the district of East Bourke Boroughs in 1883 and held it until April 1892.

Pearson remained a private member until 18 February 1886 when he became Minister of Public Instruction in the Gillies-Deakin coalition ministry, and in 1889 succeeded in passing an education act, which introduced important changes, but did not proceed far in the direction of technical education. However,it introduced the kindergarten system and 200 scholarships of £10 to £40 a year to help clever boys and girls to proceed from the primary schools to the grammar schools. He was able to implement one of the recommendations of his 1878 report, the building of a teachers college near the university. In November 1890 the Gillies-Deakin government resigned, and Pearson again became a private member. He took some interest in federation but, realizing its difficulties, adopted a cautious attitude.

===Retirement from politics===
Pearson retired from parliament in April 1892, declining to stand for election again, and began to work seriously on his book, &quot;National Life and Character: a Forecast&quot;. His indifferent health may have been one of the reasons preventing him from being offered the agent-generalship. Like everyone else, he had suffered heavy losses from the land boom and its aftereffects, and in August 1892 he left for England and accepted the secretaryship to the agent-general for Victoria. He worked hard and successfully, but though he did not complain, it must have been a great shock to him when he received a cablegram to say he was to be compulsorily retired in June. He caught a chill in February, which settled on his lungs, and died in May 1894, leaving a widow and three daughters. Mrs Pearson was given a civil list pension of £100 a year in 1895.

He is buried on the east side of the western path in Brompton Cemetery in London, midway between the north entrance and the central buildings.

==&quot;National Life and Character: a Forecast&quot;==
Pearson&#x27;s book, &quot;: a Forecast&quot;, had been published at the beginning of 1893, and created an international sensation. Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Pearson to praise the book; Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone recommended it highly, and the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read it in January 1896.

Pearson&#x27;s book caused a shock because it challenged the conventional wisdom about Western expansion, progress and triumph. Pearson argued that the &quot;Black and Yellow&quot; races were in the ascendant, as they were powered by population increase and, in the case of the Chinese, industrial capacity. He argued the so-called higher races, under the impact of declining birth rates and state socialism, had become &quot;stationary.&quot; Colonized and otherwise subordinated peoples would soon escape relations of &#x27;tutelage&#x27; and become self-governing states active on the world stage. Pearson was a prophet of decolonization and was immediately seen as such, with great attention paid to his theme of the white man under siege.

The argument strongly reinforced demands for a White Australia policy.

In August 1902 Prime Minister Edmund Barton, spoke in parliament in support of the White Australia policy; he quoted Pearson&#x27;s disturbing forecast:
:&quot;The day will come, and perhaps is not far distant, when the European observer will look round to see the globe girdled with a continuous zone of the black and yellow races, no longer too weak for aggression or under tutelage, but independent, or practically so, in government, monopolising the trade of their own regions, and circumscribing the industry of the Europeans; when Chinamen and the natives of Hindostan, the states of Central and South America, by that time predominantly Indian . . . are represented by fleets in the European seas, invited to international conferences and welcomed as allies in quarrels of the civilized world. The citizens of these countries will then be taken up into the social relations of the white races, will throng the English turf or the salons of Paris, and [End Page 43] will be admitted to inter-marriage. It is idle to say that if all this should come to pass our pride of place will not be humiliated... We shall wake to find ourselves elbowed and hustled, and perhaps even thrust aside by peoples whom we looked down upon as servile and thought of as bound always to minister to our needs. The solitary consolation will be that the changes have been inevitable.&quot;

==Other writings==
Pearson also wrote &quot;Russia by a recent traveller&quot; (1859), &quot;Insurrection in Poland&quot; (1863), &quot;The Canoness: a Tale in Verse&quot; (1871), &quot;History of England in the Fourteenth Century&quot; (1876), &quot;Biographical Sketch of Henry John Stephen Smith&quot; (1894). A selection from his miscellaneous writings, &quot;Reviews and Critical Essays,&quot; was published in 1896, with an interesting memoir by his friend, Professor Herbert Strong.

==Assessment==
&quot;Pearson had a remarkable memory and a good knowledge of classic and modern European languages; he read Ibsen and Gogol in their original tongues. Slightly built, he had the appearance of a scholar, but being shy he found it difficult to be superficially genial. He was kind with his friends and had an excellent sense of humour. Of his honesty it has been said &quot;he was one of the small class of persons whose practical adhesion to their convictions is only made more resolute by its colliding with popular sentiment or with self-interest&quot;. His health was always uncertain, probably his sojourn in Australia prolonged his life. But the debt he owed Australia was more than repaid by the public services he rendered.&quot;

<text>Marc Lescarbot (c. 1570–1641) was a French author, poet and lawyer. He is best known for his &quot;Histoire de la Nouvelle-France&quot; (1609), based on his expedition to Acadia (1606–1607) and research into French exploration in North America. Considered one of the first great books in the history of Canada, it was printed in three editions, and was translated into German.

Lescarbot also wrote numerous poems. His dramatic poem &quot;Théâtre de Neptune&quot; was performed at Port Royal as what the French claim was the first European theatrical production in North America outside of New Spain. Bernardino de Sahagún, and other 16th-century Spanish friars in Mexico, created several theatrical productions, such as &quot;Autos Sacramentales.&quot;

==Early life==
Lescarbot was born in Vervins, and his family was said to be from nearby Guise in Picardy. He wrote that his ancestors originated in Saint-Pol-de-Léon, Brittany. He first studied at the college in Vervins, then at Laon, now part of Reims. Thanks to the protection of Msgr. Valentine Duglas, the bishop of Laon, he was supported by the Collège of Laon to complete his studies in Paris. He had a classical education, learning Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and acquiring a wide knowledge of ancient and modern literatures. He also studied canonical and [[Civil law (legal system).

==Early career==
After graduating as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1596, Lescarbot took a minor part in the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Vervins]] between Spain and France. At a moment when the discussions seemed doomed to failure, Lescarbot delivered a Latin &quot;discours&quot; in defence of peace. When the treaty was concluded, he composed a poem &quot;Harangue d’action de grâces&quot;, wrote a commemorative inscription, and published &quot;[[Poèmes de la Paix]]&quot;.

In 1599 he was called to the [[Parlement of Paris]] as a lawyer. At this time, he translated into French three Latin works: &quot;le Discours de l’origine des Russiens&quot; and the &quot;Discours véritable de la réunion des églises&quot; by [[Cardinal Baronius]], and the &quot;Guide des curés&quot; by [[St. Charles Borromeo]], which he dedicated to the new bishop of Laon, [[Godefroy de Billy]]. It was published in 1613, after that dignitary&#x27;s death.

Lescarbot lived in Paris, where he associated with men of letters, such as the scholars [[Frédéric Morel|Frederic]] and [[Claude Morel]], his first printers, and the poet [[Guillaume Colletet]], who wrote a [[biography]] of him, since lost. Interested in [[medicine]], Lescarbot translated into French a pamphlet by [[Dr. Citois]], &quot;Histoire merveilleuse de l’abstinence triennale d’une fille de Confolens&quot; (1602). But he also travelled and maintained contact with his native Picardy, where he had relatives and friends such as the poets the [[Laroque brothers]] and he attracted law clients.

==Expedition to Acadia==
One of his clients, [[Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just|Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt]], who was associated with the Canadian enterprises of the [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur Du Gua de Monts]], invited Lescarbot to accompany them on an expedition to [[Acadia]] in [[New France]], and he quickly accepted. He wrote &quot;Adieu à la France&quot; in verse, and embarked at [[La Rochelle]] on 13 May 1606.

The party reached [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port-Royal]] in July and spent the remainder of the year there. The following spring, they made a trip to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] and [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Île Sainte-Croix]], where they encountered the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking indigenous peoples called the [[Mi&#x27;kmaq people|Mi&#x27;kmaq]] and the [[Maliseet|Malécite]]. Lescarbot recorded the numbers from one to ten in the Maliseet language, together with making notes on the native songs and languages. When de Monts&#x27;s licence was revoked in the summer of 1607, the whole colony had to return to France.

==Life in France==
On his return, Lescarbot published a poem on &quot;La défaite des sauvages armouchiquois&quot; (1607). Inspired by seeing parts of the New World, he wrote an extensive history of the French settlements in the Americas, the &quot;Histoire de la Nouvelle-France.&quot; The first edition was published in Paris in 1609, by the bookseller Jean Millot. An English translation of the &quot;Histoire&quot; was made by W. L. Grant in 1907 as part of the [[Champlain Society]]&#x27;s General Series. The author recounted the early voyages of [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]], [[Jean Ribault]], and [[Dominique de Gourgues]] to present-day [[Florida]]; those of [[Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon|Durand de Villegaignon]] and [[Jean de Léry]] to Brazil; and those of [[Verrazzano]], [[Jacques Cartier]], and [[Jean-François Roberval]] to Canada. The last section was the least original part of his work, and relied on published sources.

Lescarbot&#x27;s history of de Monts&#x27; ventures in Acadia was original work. During his year at Port-Royal, he met the survivors of the short-lived settlement at Sainte-Croix; talked with [[François Gravé Du Pont]], de Monts, and Champlain, the promoters and members of the earlier expeditions; and visited old fishing captains, who knew [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the Acadian coasts. His account was firsthand from what he had seen or learned from those who had taken part in the events or witnessed them at first hand.

In the successive editions of his &quot;Histoire&quot;, in 1611–12 and 1617–18, and in his complementary pamphlets, &quot;La conversion des sauvages&quot; (1610) and the &quot;Relation derrière&quot; (1612), Lescarbot reshaped and completed his account. (&quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says it was published in six editions from 1609 to 1618.) He added material on Poutrincourt&#x27;s resettlement of the colony, as well as his and his son Charles de Biencourt&#x27;s disputes with their competitors and the ruin of Acadia by Jesuits Biard, Massé and Du The, and [[Samuel Argall]]. Lescarbot relied on the accounts of Poutrincourt, Biencourt, Imbert, or other witnesses. His work expresses their point of view, but it is valuable for recounting incidents and texts that would otherwise have been lost.

He devoted the last section of his &quot;Histoire&quot; to describing the aboriginal natives. Keenly interested in the [[Indigenous peoples|First Nations]] peoples, he frequently visited the &quot;Souriquois&quot; ([[Micmaq]]) chiefs and warriors while in La Nouvelle France. He observed their customs, collected their remarks, and recorded their chants. In many respects, he found them more civilized and virtuous than Europeans, but in his book, he expressed pity for their ignorance of the pleasures of wine and love. Lescarbot introduced the [[Mi&#x27;kmaq language|Mi&#x27;kmaq]] word &quot;[[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]]&quot; into the French language in his publication in 1610.

Lescarbot had strong opinions about the colonies, which he saw as a field of action for men of courage, an outlet for trade, a social benefit and a means for the mother country to extend its influence. He favoured a commercial monopoly to meet the expenses of colonization; for him, freedom of trade led only to anarchy and produced nothing stable. Lescarbot sided with his patron Poutrincourt in his dispute with the Jesuits. Historians do not believe that he wrote the satire the &quot;Factum&quot; of 1614 [see General Bibliography], which some authors attribute to him; he was working in Switzerland when it was published.

All the editions of the &quot;Histoire include&quot;, as an appendix, a short collection of poems, &quot;Les muses de la Nouvelle-France&quot;, which were also published separately. Lescarbot dedicated the book to Brulart de Sillery. Like his contemporary [[François de Malherbe]], Lescarbot tended to write poetry as an occasional diversion and a means of pleasing the elite to acquire patronage. He had a feeling for nature and a keen sensibility, and sometimes found agreeable rhythms and images; but his verse is considered clumsy and hastily wrought.

His &quot;Théâtre de Neptune&quot;, which is part of the &quot;Muses&quot;, was performed as a theatrical presentation at Port-Royal to celebrate Poutrincourt&#x27;s return. In a nautical work, the god [[Neptune]] arrives by [[Barque|bark]] to welcome the traveller. He is surrounded by a court of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s and Indians, who recite in turn, in French, [[Gascon language|Gascon]], and Souriquois verse, praises of colonial leaders, followed by singing the glory of the French king, to the sound of trumpets and firing cannons. This performance in the Port-Royal harbour, with its mixture of paganism and mythology, was the first theatrical presentation in North America outside of New Spain.

Lescarbot dedicated the second edition of his &quot;Histoire&quot; to President Jeannin. His son-in-law, Pierre de Castille, hired Lescarbot as his secretary to accompany him to Switzerland, where Castille had been appointed ambassador to the Thirteen Cantons. The post allowed Lescarbot to travel, visit part of Germany, and frequent the popular social watering-places. He wrote a &quot;Tableau de la Suisse&quot;, in poetry and prose, a half-descriptive, half-historical production. He was appointed to the office of naval commissary. When the &quot;Tableau&quot; was published (1618), the king sent him a gratuity of 300 livres.

==Marriage and family==
Although appreciative of female society, Lescarbot did not marry until he was nearly 50. On 3 September 1619, at [[Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois]], he married Françoise de Valpergue, a young widow of noble birth who had been ruined by swindlers. Her dowry was said to be a lawsuit to defend. Her family&#x27;s house and estates, burdened with debt, had been seized by creditors who had occupied them for 30 years. Lescarbot, a brilliant lawyer, worked to restore his wife&#x27;s inheritance. He gained her re-possession of the Valpergues&#x27; house in the village of Presles and of an agricultural estate, the farm of Saint-Audebert. An endless series of court actions required his continuing defense and took what little revenues the unprofitable lands yielded.

In 1629, Lescarbot published two poems about the siege of [[La Rochelle]]: &quot;La chasse aux Anglais&quot; (Hunting the English) and &quot;La victoire du roi&quot; (The King&#x27;s Victory), possibly seeking favor with [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. With continuing interest in New France, Lescarbot stayed in touch with Charles de Biencourt and Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour. He also corresponded with Isaac de Razilly, governor of Acadia. Razilly recounted details about the founding of [[La Hève]], and invited Lescarbot to settle in Acadia with his wife. He chose to stay in Presles, where he died in 1641. He left all of his worldly belongings to Samuel Lescarbot II, including his collection of accessories made from gopher materials, including a famous pen (since lost) made from a femur.

Lescarbot is considered a picturesque figure among the [[annalists]] of New France. Between [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]], the man of action, and the [[missionaries]] concerned with evangelization, the lawyer-poet is a scholar and a humanist, a disciple of [[Ronsard]] and [[Montaigne]]. He had intellectual curiosity and embraced the Graeco-Latin culture of the [[Renaissance]]. Although a Roman Catholic, Lescarbot was friends with Protestants; his attitude of independent judgment and free inquiry contributed to a reputation for unorthodoxy. He was a faithful reflection of his period.

He was a prolific writer in a variety of genres, evidence of his intelligence and the range of his talents. He wrote some manuscript notes and miscellaneous poems. He is believed to have written several pamphlets, published anonymously or left in manuscript, including a &quot;Traité de la polygamie&quot;, which he had talked about. He was also a musician, a calligrapher and a draughtsman. Canadian folklorists can claim him since he was the first to record the notation of Indian songs.

==Legacy and honors==
Lescarbot&#x27;s best known work is &quot;Histoire de la Nouvelle-France&quot;, published in 1609. The work was translated into German and English shortly after its publication, and was released in six editions between 1609 and 1618, with a seventh released in 1866. &quot;Histoire de la Nouvelle-France&quot; was translated again into English in 1907 by L. W. Grant, as part of the General Series of the [[Champlain Society]].

In 2006, on the 400th anniversary of the first performance of Theatre de Neptune, a revival was planned by the Atlantic Fringe, but the performance was cancelled due to lack of CAC funding, as well as controversy over the perceived imperialist messages of the play. A &quot;radical deconstruction&quot; entitled &quot;Sinking Neptune&quot; was performed as part of the 2006 Montreal Infringement Festival, despite the cancellation of the event it protested.

<doc id="1189734" wikidata="Q756858" url="?curid=1189734" title="Asr (prayer)">
<text>Asr () is one of the mandatory five daily Islamic prayers.

The Asr prayer consists of four obligatory cycles, rak&#x27;a. An additional four rak&#x27;a sunna prayer is recommended to be performed before the obligatory prayer. As with Dhuhr, if it is performed in congregation, the imam is silent except when announcing the takbir, i&#x27;tidal, and taslim.

The period of Asr begins approximately when the sun is halfway down from noon to sunset (various schools of thought of Islam differ on the starting point; some say that it begins when the shadow of an object equals its actual length plus its shadow during noon, others say that the actual length must be doubled). Asr ends at sunset.

The middle prayer mentioned in the Quran 2:238, is interpreted by Islamic scholars as being either the Asr prayer or the Fajr prayer. Muslims are commanded to protect the middle prayer, meaning that it should be performed at all costs.

Al-Asr is also the title of the 103rd sura of the Qur’ān.

==Name variations==
==Format==
The Asr prayer consist of four obligatory rakats, along with two or four sunnah rakats preceding it. Although, according to some &quot;madh&#x27;habs&quot;, it may be reduced to two &quot;rakaʿāts&quot; when travelling.

==Ja&#x27;fari and Zaydi schools of thought==
According to the Ja&#x27;fari and Zaydi schools of thought the time period within which the Asr prayer must be recited is the following:

*Time begins: once the Dhuhr prayer (mid-day daily prayer) has been recited.
*Time ends: at the beginning of the setting of the Sun.

However, it is very important to recite the prayer as soon as the time begins. Letter 52 of Nahj al-Balagha contains instruction of Ali to his governors on the timings of salat, &quot;The Asr prayers can be performed till the sun is still bright and enough time of the day is left for a person to cover a distance of six miles.&quot;

==Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi’i, and Maliki schools of thought==
The time period within which the Asr prayer must be recited is the following:

*Time begins: The Sunni schools differ on when the time begins. The Maliki, Shafi`i, and Hanbali schools say it is at the time when the length of any object&#x27;s shadow equals the length of the object itself plus the length of that object&#x27;s shadow at noon. The dominant opinion in the Hanafi school says it begins when the length of any object&#x27;s shadow is twice the length of the object plus the length of that object&#x27;s shadow at noon.
*Time ends: Once the sun has completely set below the horizon. However, it is frowned upon (and sinful in the Maliki school) to delay the prayer without a legitimate excuse to the point of the day in which the sun turns a pale red or orange color as it begins to set, though it would still be considered to have been prayed on time.

The Islamic prophet Muhammad said, &quot;He who observes Al-Bardayn (i.e., Fajr and ‘Asr prayers) will enter Jannah.&quot;

In another hadith:
Muhammad said &#x27;He who misses his Asr Salat (i.e. performs it after its specified time) is as if he had lost his wife, children and all his wealth.’ (Sahih Muslim)

<text>Black Tom Cassidy (Thomas Samuel Eamon Cassidy) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the X-Men, and of his cousin, Banshee. In addition to fighting the X-Men, he has clashed with Deadpool a number of times.

Black Tom is a mutant who can manipulate, bond with, and project energy through plant life. He is also capable of issuing concussive blasts with a wooden object, usually a shillelagh. Tom was the black sheep of a prominent Irish family. He secretly raised Banshee&#x27;s daughter Siryn, of whose existence Banshee was unaware, and conscripted her into his criminal gang. Black Tom was also a longtime criminal partner of the super-strong villain Juggernaut, until Juggernaut&#x27;s reformation.

Black Tom Cassidy made his film debut in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, played by Jack Kesy.

==Fictional character biography==
===Family===

Black Tom was born in Dublin. He is the cousin of Sean Cassidy, the Banshee, a member of the X-Men. He was also once the only friend of the Juggernaut.

His original principal power was that he could generate blasts of heat through a wooden medium, such as the shillelagh that he often carries. He has a rivalry with Sean, mainly because Sean won both Cassidy Keep, their estate, and the family fortune from Tom in a game of dice. They were also rivals for a woman named Maeve Rourke, whom Sean married.

While Sean was away, working for Interpol, Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an IRA bombing. With no means to contact Sean, Tom took care of Theresa.

When Sean returned to learn of his wife&#x27;s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve.

While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

===Supervillain===
Later Tom became a criminal and came into conflict with the law and was apprehended. While serving time in prison, Tom met and befriended Juggernaut. The two became close friends and allies, and worked together on missions. As part of his revenge scheme against Sean, Tom murdered a lawyer ally of Banshee. Black Tom and Juggernaut then took Banshee and the other X-Men prisoner at Cassidy Keep. He was defeated in a duel by Banshee. Black Tom and Juggernaut next hired Arcade to kill the X-Men.

Alongside Juggernaut and Theresa (now under the codename Siryn), Tom went to San Francisco and stole the United States&#x27; vibranium supply. Several X-Men and the original Spider-Woman liberated the vibranium and captured Black Tom and Siryn. Convinced a life of crime was too dangerous for Theresa, Black Tom exonerated her of responsibility for the theft, and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was. Juggernaut broke him out of prison the same day.

Tom next sent the Juggernaut to abduct Madame Web, observing Juggernaut&#x27;s battle with Spider-Man from afar. Black Tom was briefly endowed with half the powers of Juggernaut by the Ruby of Cyttorak, and then teamed with Juggernaut against Spider-Man and the X-Men.

Black Tom next took Gideon and Sunspot hostage on behalf of Arianna Jankos. He used an interdimensional teleporter to return the Juggernaut to Earth. He then battled Siryn and her teammates in X-Force. Cable shot Tom, and Deadpool took Tom to Mr. Tolliver.

===Transformation===
After being shot by Cable, Tom was taken to France, where doctors grafted a wood-like substance onto his wounds, healing him and allowing him to channel his bio-blasts through his fists. However, the substance spread over Tom&#x27;s body, transforming him into a humanoid plant and driving him insane.

During this time, Black Tom resurfaced as a member of the latest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Earlier, Juggernaut had infiltrated the X-Men for him as part of the Brotherhood&#x27;s plan, though Juggernaut slowly changed during his time with the X-Men, mostly due to the influence of Sammy Paré. Juggernaut rejoined the Brotherhood, secretly planning on turning them when the time was right. Sammy stumbled upon the group, and assuming that Juggernaut was betraying the X-Men, started lashing out. In retaliation Tom murdered Sammy, causing Juggernaut to attack him. Juggernaut managed to escape and warn the X-Men, while Black Tom led an attack on the X-Mansion. In the end, Xorn sucked Black Tom and the rest of the Brotherhood into a black hole.

===M-Day===
After M-Day, Black Tom woke up as a human again, losing his secondary mutation but possibly still retaining his old powers, along with his sanity. The organization Black Air hired Tom to attack the new incarnation of Excalibur, of which Juggernaut was now a member. Though he easily defeated the others, Juggernaut confronted his former friend and convinced him to turn himself in for the death of Sammy, saying &quot;He was a kid, Tom. An&#x27; you an&#x27; me, for all our faults, we used ta be better than that.&quot; Tom also showed remorse for killing the child, &quot;That wasn&#x27;t me, Cain, you know that. I wasn&#x27;t in my right mind... You&#x27;ve got to understand... that mad life, before... it was like some dream.&quot;

===&quot;Deadpool&quot;===
Black Tom reappears in &quot;Deadpool&quot;, where he was hired by Black Box to hunt Deadpool.

===X-Men: Blue===
Black Tom resurfaces with the Juggernaut attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced young X-Men, with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.

===Dawn of X===
Thomas is one amongst many within Homo Superior, both heroes and villains alike, who accepts the invitation to the new mutant home nation of Krakoa on the grounds that all who call it home forgo any petty rivalries or their criminal ways. These are terms that Black Tom gratefully accepts; eventually taking a job at internal/external security through a physiological union between himself and the living isle to better articulate his powers. It is also implied that one of the reasons Black Tom is loyal to Krakoa is because they have promised to resurrect Squid-Boy, who he regretted killing.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Black Tom Cassidy was a mutant with the ability to generate concussive blasts of force and heat. He typically carried a shillelagh, a wooden fighting stick, which he used as a focus for his power. He is immune to Banshee&#x27;s sonic powers, as their powers cancel each other out on contact.

Later, Cassidy becomes a humanoid plant capable of assimilating other plants, creating plant clones of himself and others, and controlling others via his tendrils. Following the events of &quot;Decimation&quot;, he loses his plant form, but retains the ability to manipulate plants.

Later, Cassidy becomes connected to Krakoa and gains the ability to manipulate its land and foliage.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of &quot;Black Tom&quot; Cassidy called &quot;Blackie&quot; Cassidy appears in &quot;X-Men Noir&quot; #1. This version is a drug dealer with ties to the Brotherhood, a secret society of corrupt police officers and detectives.

==In other media==
* Black Tom Cassidy appears in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;. This version is Banshee&#x27;s younger brother.
* Black Tom Cassidy appears in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, portrayed by Jack Kesy. This version is an inmate of the Ice Box who is later killed during a fight between Deadpool and Cable amidst a prison transfer.

<text>James Gates Percival (September 15, 1795 – May 2, 1856) was an American poet, surgeon, and geologist, born in Berlin, Connecticut, and died in Hazel Green, Wisconsin.
==Biography==
James Gates Percival was a precocious child and a versatile, yet morbid and impractical man. He had a remarkable ability to write verse on various subjects and in almost every known meter. His sentimentalism and dazzling diction appealed to a wide audience, earning him a reputation as the foremost poet in the United States during the 1820s. Some of his most famous poems include &quot;Prometheus,&quot; &quot;The Coral Grove,&quot; and &quot;The Graves of the Patriots.&quot; He was also a renowned geologist.

Percival entered Yale College at the age of 16 and graduated at the head of his class at the age of 20. After graduating, he pursued a career in medicine and relocated to Charleston, South Carolina. In 1823, a volume of his collected poems was published in New York and London. In 1824, he briefly served as a professor of chemistry at West Point before resigning and dedicating several years to assisting Noah Webster in editing his &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, published in 1828.

In 1835, the governor of Connecticut commissioned Percival to prepare a geological survey of the state, which he completed and published in 1842. In 1854, he was appointed as the State Geologist for Wisconsin and tasked with conducting a similar geological survey. The first annual report was issued in 1855, but while preparing the second annual report, Percival fell ill and passed away in May 1856. Most of his life was spent at his home in New Haven, Connecticut. Following his death, he was the subject of an admiring biography by Julius H. Ward.

<text>Dr. James Lawrence Cabell (August 26, 1813 – August 13, 1889 ) was an American sanitarian and author.

==Life==
He was born in Nelson County, Virginia, the son of Dr. George Cabell, Jr., and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1833. He then studied medicine in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Paris, and became Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the University of Virginia, where he was chairman of the faculty in 1846 and 1847. Cabell was a full professor at the School of Medicine for 52 years (1842-1889) and was an early pioneer of the sanitary preparation of the surgical patient following Lister&#x27;s principles. 

He was in charge of the Confederate military hospitals during the Civil War. When yellow fever broke out in Memphis, Tennessee he was appointed chairman of the National Sanitary Conference and devised a plan that checked the spread of the epidemic.

In 1859, he published “The Testimony of Modern Science to the Unity of Mankind”. This work advanced the idea of evolution one year before publication of Darwin&#x27;s “Origin of Species.” Cabell founded the National Board of Health which in 1880 became the U.S. Public Health Service. From 1879 until his death in Overton, Virginia, he was president of the National Board of Health.

==Works==
He wrote &quot;The Testimony of Modern Science to the Unity of Mankind&quot; (New York, 1858).

==Life and career==
===Early work===
Quirke began her career as a child actress with an appearance in &quot;Dixon of Dock Green.&quot; Another early role was that of an autistic teenager in the 1975 TV drama &quot;Jenny Can&#x27;t Work Any Faster&quot;.

By 1976, she had her own TV show, &quot;Pauline&#x27;s Quirkes&quot;, on Thames Television, which featured pop music, teenage topics, and comedy sketches. This was also the first television show in which Quirke and Linda Robson appeared together regularly. In 1976, she played the lead role in the &quot;Special Offer&quot; episode of ATV&#x27;s &quot;Beasts&quot;, by Nigel Kneale, also starring Wensley Pithey and Martin Shaw. Quirke also had a small role in the movie &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; in 1980. Quirke played Veronica in &quot;Shine on Harvey Moon&quot; in 1982.

Quirke&#x27;s big break came in 1989, when she began playing the part of Sharon Theodopolopodous in the BBC sitcom &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; with Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph. The series ran on the BBC from 1989 to 1998 and was resurrected on ITV between 2014 and 2017, with the final episode in December 2020 in which Quirke did not appear.

===Later work===
From 1994 to 1999, Quirke appeared in a series of Surf adverts with Linda Robson, and the pair worked together on the BBC documentary series &quot;Jobs for the Girls&quot;. In 1996, she starred in the BBC television adaptation of &quot;The Sculptress&quot; by Minette Walters, receiving much critical acclaim for her performance, including a British Academy TV Award nomination for Best Actress. When &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; ended, Quirke began playing DI Maisie Raine in &quot;Maisie Raine&quot;, a drama series for BBC One, which ran in 1998 and 1999.

From 2000 to 2003, Quirke starred opposite Warren Clarke in the BBC series &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. She made a return to comedy in 2000 when she starred with Neil Stuke, Robert Daws and Pippa Haywood in BBC sitcom &quot;Office Gossip&quot;. After a start with over six million viewers, the show found its ratings dropped and it was cancelled after only one series. However, Quirke was nominated for &quot;Most Popular Comedy Performer&quot; at the National Television Awards for her role. In 2002, she starred alongside Nitin Ganatra in &quot;Being April&quot;, a comedy drama for BBC One. Quirke appeared in &quot;Carrie&#x27;s War&quot; in 2004 and in 2005, played a major role in &quot;The Bill&quot; as Cath Wilson, a woman wrongly convicted of murdering a child.

In 2006, Quirke played Colleen McCabe in &quot;The Thieving Headmistress&quot; and in 2008, she appeared in an episode of &quot;My Family&quot; as Sharon the Bank Robber. Quirke has frequently been seen in the audience of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and has appeared on its companion show &quot;It Takes Two&quot; more than once. She was a contestant on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; in June 2007, but was disqualified for creating a dish that was described by Loyd Grossman as &quot;in no way resembling a meal&quot;.

In 2007, Quirke set up The Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, which opened at various locations across the UK as an extracurricular centre for young people who want to learn performing arts. The academy operates at over 200 locations in the United Kingdom.

In 2009 and 2010, she played the lead role in the BBC daytime drama series &quot;Missing&quot; as DS Mary Jane &quot;MJ&quot; Croft, head of a Missing Persons Unit. In May 2010, it was announced that Quirke would be joining the rural soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as Hazel Rhodes, the mother of established character, Jackson Walsh. Quirke said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never done anything like this before so it&#x27;s something different for me and I&#x27;m very happy to be a part of it.&quot; On 16 May 2011, it was announced that Quirke had decided to quit &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. Her character left on 25 January 2012.

From 2013 to 2015, Quirke had a recurring role as Susan Wright in ITV drama series &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, appearing in all eight episodes of the first series and returning to feature in two of the eight episodes of the second series. Her pet Labrador, Bailey, also appeared in the programme. She was a guest panellist on &quot;Loose Women&quot; on two occasions. In 2015, she played the role of Paula Winton in the ten-part comedy thriller &quot;You, Me and the Apocalypse&quot; for Sky1.

Quirke decided not to be involved in the final episode of &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; in December 2020, in order to concentrate on her Performing Arts Academies.

===Charity work===
Quirke is an honorary member of the NSPCC, supports the charities Children with Leukaemia, Children in Crisis and Children’s Hospices UK. She is a patron of Rennie Grove Hospice.

==Personal life==
Quirke has two children and is married to producer Steve Sheen, who also worked on &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; as an executive producer from 2014 until 2017. Her son Charlie appeared as Travis in &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; from 2014 until 2017.

She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to young people, the entertainment industry and charity.

In 2025, Quirke&#x27;s husband announced that she would be retiring from all professional and commercial duties due to a diagnosis of dementia which she had received in 2021.

<doc id="1189767" wikidata="Q1666246" url="?curid=1189767" title="Intermission (film)">
<text>Intermission is a 2003 Irish black comedy crime film directed by John Crowley and written by Mark O&#x27;Rowe. The film, set in Dublin, Ireland, contains many interconnected storylines, and is shot in a documentary-like style, with some sections presented as excerpts from television programs that exist within the show (one of the storylines follows a television documentary director).

It features several of Ireland&#x27;s best-known actors, including Cillian Murphy, Colm Meaney and Colin Farrell, all of whom have featured in internationally successful films such as &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (Murphy), &quot;The Commitments&quot; (Meaney) and &quot;Minority Report&quot; (Farrell). It also featured the Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald, who had appeared in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.

== Plot ==
The film opens with Lehiff (Colin Farrell) charming a cashier. After flirting with the girl, he punches her in the face and steals from the till. It quickly moves to John (Cillian Murphy) and Deirdre (Kelly Macdonald), a recently-separated young couple. The film will revolve around their extended friends.

It is quickly revealed that Lehiff is a petty criminal and always involved in trouble. Lehiff&#x27;s nemesis, Garda Detective Jerry Lynch (Colm Meaney), presents himself as a saviour whose main mission is to fight the &quot;scumbags&quot; on Dublin&#x27;s streets. He enlists the help of Ben Campion (Tomás Ó Súilleabháin), an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his &quot;go-softer&quot; boss, who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream &quot;docusoap&quot; series on Irish television.

Next up is Mick (Brían F. O&#x27;Byrne), a Dublin bus driver. While on his route, Sally (Shirley Henderson) boards. Deeply insecure about her looks, she asks Mick about some hair on her lip, and he mocks her playfully. As the bus journey continues, Philip, a young boy, throws a rock at his bus, resulting in a bad crash, the aftermath of which Ben winds up shooting. Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally, Deirdre&#x27;s sister, who helped the passengers after the crash. She grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam (Michael McElhatton), a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of fourteen years, Noeleen, leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife.

John is utterly lost without Deirdre and is determined to win her back. Mick, having become suspended from his job and low on funds, comes up with a scheme involving Lehiff and John. They kidnap Sam and hold Deirdre captive. They force Sam to go to his bank to get money for a ransom. Just as the plan seems to be working out, everything goes wrong, as Sam is assaulted by his enraged wife Noeleen on the street and the Gardaí are forced to intervene. Mick and John flee without the money.

Later, Mick loses his job after being wrongfully blamed for the crash; he becomes obsessed with taking revenge on the boy who caused it. After chasing Philip in his car, he loses control and is left balancing over the canal. Philip sits on the bonnet and jumps off, letting the car drop into the canal.

Detective Lynch chases and corners Lehiff in an open field. He decides to take him on, while Ben films everything. Unfortunately, Lynch miscalculates; Lehiff gets the upper hand and threatens to kill him. Ben snatches at the gun and shoots Lehiff. Lynch covers it all up.

As the credits roll, Noeleen and Sam, now reunited, are in their house watching television. She is purposely sitting on the remote control and bullying him into changing the channels by hand.

<text>Monopoly Junior is a simplified version of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, designed for young children, which was originally released in 1990. It has a rectangular board that is smaller than the standard game and rather than using street names it is based on a city&#x27;s amusements (a zoo, a video game arcade, a pizzeria, etc.) to make the game more child-friendly. There are many different models of the game.

==History==
Parker Brothers began producing &quot;Monopoly Junior&quot; in 1990, explicitly marketed for players aged five to eight, with a simplified board and game play as compared to the standard &quot;Monopoly&quot; game. The &quot;Monopoly Junior&quot; board was based on a fair&#x27;s midway, and featured 16 &quot;amusements&quot; rather than 28 properties. Players chose a car token in one of four colors (red roller coaster car, blue bumper car, green flume and yellow carousel horse), and used corresponding colored &quot;ticket booths&quot; (hotel pieces from the standard &quot;Monopoly&quot; game) to denote ownership of the amusements in lieu of title deeds. The game play mechanics are the same as the standard game: players roll a die (a single die, rather than two dice) and move their token clockwise around the board the number of spaces corresponding to the rolled die.

When players land on a vacant amusement they must purchase the amusement for the price shown on the board; the player cannot decline to buy the amusement, and there is no auction. However, as in the standard game, if players have enough money to buy, but not the exact amount, the banker (who also plays) &quot;can&quot; make change. Amusements cannot be improved with houses or hotels as in the standard &quot;Monopoly&quot; game. When a player lands on an amusement owned by an opponent they must pay their opponent the value of the amusement marked on the board. If a player lands on one of a pair of amusements of the same color owned by the same player they must pay their opponent double the value of the amusement they landed on. Play continues until one of the players is bankrupted; the player with the most cash on hand wins.

In 2013, the game was revised with the board now based on a simplified version of a city rather than a midway. The player tokens were replaced with a green car, blue ship, orange cat and black dog. The ticket booths were replaced with &quot;sold signs&quot;, cardboard pieces featuring cartoon caricatures of the player tokens. The $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5 notes were replaced with single-denomination &quot;&quot;Monopoly&quot; money&quot; notes, and the prices on the board were denoted with a &quot;Monopoly&quot; money currency glyph (an uppercase &#x27;M&#x27; with two horizontal crossbars) instead of dollars or pounds. The board became more reminiscent of the standard &quot;Monopoly&quot; board, replacing the &quot;Rest Rooms&quot; (or &quot;Café&quot;, depending on the version of the board) with &quot;Jail&quot; and &quot;Uncle Pennybag&#x27;s Loose Change&quot; with &quot;Free Parking&quot;. The four Railroad spaces, the Fireworks space, the Water Show and two Chance spaces were also eliminated, reducing the board size from 32 spaces to 24.

==Board==

Some space names on the British version of the board have different names, similar to the UK version of the original &quot;Monopoly&quot; board: &quot;Park Lane&quot; instead of &quot;Park Place&quot;, and &quot;Mayfair&quot; instead of &quot;Boardwalk&quot;, etc.

Several of the space names are changed to British English terms on the British version of the board: &quot;Candy Floss&quot; instead of &quot;Cotton Candy&quot;, &quot;Water Chute&quot; instead of &quot;Water Slide&quot;, &quot;Dodgems&quot; instead of &quot;Bumper Cars&quot;, &quot;Big Wheel&quot; instead of &quot;Ferris Wheel&quot; and &quot;railways&quot; instead of &quot;railroads&quot;. Depending on the version of the board the Rest Rooms may be alternatively called the Café, and Uncle Pennybags may be alternatively called Mr. Monopoly.

==Rules==
:&quot;Source: Monopoly Junior (2013) official rules&quot;
Players take turns in order, with the initial player determined by age before the game: the youngest player goes first. Players are dealt an initial amount &quot;Monopoly&quot; money depending on the total number of players playing: 20 in a two-player game, 18 in a three-player game or 16 in a four-player game. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the die and the player advancing their token clockwise around the board the corresponding number of spaces. When the player lands on an unowned space they must purchase the space from the bank for the amount indicated on the board, and places a sold sign on the coloured band at the top of the space to denote ownership. If a player lands on a space owned by an opponent the player pays the opponent rent in the amount written on the board. If the opponent owns both properties of the same colour the rent is doubled.

A player may sell properties for extra money or if they do not have enough money to pay a debt.

A player who lands on or passes the GO space collects 2 &quot;Monopoly&quot; money from the bank. Players who land on a Chance space must take the top Chance card from the draw pile and follow the instructions. No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking or Just Visiting. Players who land on Go To Jail must move their token to Jail (without passing GO nor collecting 2 &quot;Monopoly&quot; money). To get out of Jail the player may use a Get Out of Jail Free card or pay 1 &quot;Monopoly&quot; money to the bank at the start of their next turn.

The game is over when a player is bankrupted by not having enough money to pay rent, buy a property or pay a fee on a Chance card. The remaining player with the most money wins. In the event of a tie the player with the most properties wins.

===1990 original rules===
:&quot;Source: Monopoly Junior (1990) official rules&quot;

The rules of the original &quot;Monopoly Junior&quot; game are very similar to the modern rules. Players are dealt $31 at the beginning of the game: five $1 notes, four $2, three $3, one $4 and one $5. Players take turns in order, with the initial player determined by chance before the game: players roll the die, and the highest roller goes first. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the die and the player advancing their token clockwise around the board the corresponding number of spaces. When the player lands on a vacant amusement they must purchase the amusement from the bank for the amount indicated on the board, and places a ticket booth token on the colored band at the top of the space to denote ownership. If a player lands on an amusement owned by an opponent the player pays the opponent rent in the amount written on the board. If the opponent owns both amusements of the same color the rent is doubled!

A player who lands on or passes the GO space collects $2 from the bank. Players who land on a Chance space must take the top Chance card from the draw pile and follow the instructions. Chance cards indicating a Free Ticket Booth allow the player to claim a vacant amusement of the color indicated on the card for free, or to remove the ticket booth from an amusement (of the indicated color) owned by another player, unless both amusements of that color are owned by one player; in which case, the player who drew the Chance card must discard it and draw another. No reward or penalty is given for landing on the Rest Rooms, as they are &quot;Just Waiting&quot;. Players who land on &quot;Pay $3 Take the Tramway to the Rest Rooms&quot; must pay $3 and place it on Mr. Monopoly&#x27;s Loose Change and move their token to the Rest Rooms (without passing GO or collecting $2). On their next turn they may roll the die and move their token as usual. Players who land on the Fireworks or Water Show must place $2 on Mr. Monopoly&#x27;s Loose Change. A player who lands on Mr. Monopoly&#x27;s Loose Change is rewarded with any money on the space. Players who land on any of the Railroads must roll the die again and move their token.

The game is over when a player is bankrupted by not having enough money to pay rent, buy an amusement or pay a fee. All remaining players count their money, and the player with the most money wins.

===2006 rules changes===
:&quot;Source: Monopoly Junior (2006) official rules&quot;

There are no Uncle Pennybag&#x27;s Loose Change or Restroom spots.

Uncle Pennybag&#x27;s Loose Change is now called Mr. Monopoly&#x27;s Loose Change. 
Restroom spots are replaced with Lunch spots. 
Players who land on &#x27;Go To Lunch&#x27; pay $3 to the bank, then move the pawn directly to Lunch without passing &#x27;GO&#x27; or collecting $2.

<text>Charles Carroll Simms (1824–1884) a native of Virginia, became a United States Navy midshipman in 1839. He served in the U.S. Navy for more than two decades, achieving the rank of Lieutenant in 1854. He was dismissed from the service in April 1861, after his state left the United States, and briefly was an officer in Virginia&#x27;s Navy. Commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy in June 1861, during that year he commanded the steamer CSS &quot;George Page&quot; and was assigned to the steamer CSS &quot;Rappahannock&quot;. Also commanded CSS Appomattox in coastal North Carolina until it was scuttled in February 1862. As an officer of the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, he took part in her March–May 1862 actions in the vicinity of Hampton Roads. Subsequently, he served in the gunboats CSS &quot;Nansemond&quot; on the James River, and CSS &quot;Selma&quot; in Mobile Bay. During the American Civil War&#x27;s final year, while assigned to the Mobile Squadron, he commanded the ironclads CSS &quot;Baltic&quot; and CSS &quot;Nashville&quot;. First Lieutenant Simms surrendered to Federal forces in early May 1865 and was paroled soon afterwards.

Simms was born 30 Mar 1824 in Virginia to John Douglas Simms and Eleanor Carroll Brent. He married Elizabeth James Nourse about 1852 and he died 18 Dec 1884 in Georgetown, Washington, D. C. He and his wife are buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington D.C. The Simms family was one of public service. His father, John Douglass Simms, was a Chief Clerk of the Navy Department and Acting Secretary of the Navy in 1841 with the resignation of George E. Badger. Col. Charles Simms, grandfather of Charles Carroll Simms, was, among other things, an officer in the American Revolution and Mayor of Alexandria, Virginia.

<doc id="1189804" wikidata="Q777629" url="?curid=1189804" title="Presumed Innocent (film)">
<text>Presumed Innocent is a 1990 American legal thriller film based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Scott Turow. Directed by Alan J. Pakula, and written by Pakula and Frank Pierson, it stars Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Raúl Juliá, Bonnie Bedelia, Paul Winfield and Greta Scacchi. The film follows Rusty Sabich (Ford), a prosecutor who is charged with the murder of his colleague and mistress Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi).

Several studios and producers fought to secure the film rights one year before the novel was published. Producers Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg acquired the rights in December 1986 and hired Pierson to write the script. After an unsuccessful pre-production development at United Artists, the project moved to Warner Bros., and Pakula was brought in to rewrite the script with Pierson before signing on as the film&#x27;s director in January 1989. Principal photography commenced in July 1989 and concluded in October of that year, with a budget of $20 million. Filming took place on locations in Detroit, Windsor, Ontario, and New Jersey, and on soundstages at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York.

&quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; premiered at the Fox Bruin Theater in Los Angeles, California, on July 25, 1990, before being released across North America on July 27, 1990. The film has an approval rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its directing, acting, and writing. It grossed $221 million worldwide and became the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1990. The film was followed by a television miniseries, &quot;The Burden of Proof&quot;, in 1992, and a television film sequel, &quot;Innocent&quot;, in 2011.

==Plot==
Rozat &quot;Rusty&quot; Sabich is a prosecutor and the right-hand man of district attorney Raymond Horgan. When his colleague Carolyn Polhemus is found raped and murdered in her apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty take charge of the investigation. With the election for District Attorney approaching, Tommy Molto, the acting head of the homicide division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia. Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had a brief sexual affair with Carolyn. Rusty has since reconciled with his wife Barbara but is still obsessed with Carolyn.

Detective Harold Greer is initially in charge of the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Raymond grows furious with Rusty&#x27;s handling of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer&#x27;s inquiries uncover the affair.

Rusty hires Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that an important piece of evidence, a beer glass with Rusty’s fingerprints, is missing. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.

The thrust of Stern&#x27;s defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty. During the cross-examination of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn&#x27;s body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive, and the fact that the fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern reveals that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn and that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.

Shortly after, at home, Rusty discovers a small hatchet with blood and hair on it. Barbara admits that she murdered Carolyn because of the affair. She expresses that she had left enough evidence for Rusty to know that she committed the crime but did not anticipate him being charged. In a voice-over, Rusty explains that Carolyn&#x27;s murder remains unsolved as trying two people for the same crime is &quot;a practical impossibility&quot; and he could never take the mother away from his son even if it were possible to prosecute her. Rusty states that there is a culprit and a punishment in this case, meaning he feels guilty because his actions led to Carolyn&#x27;s death.

===Development===

Scott Turow&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; had first attracted film producers a year before it was published. The film rights were the subject of a bidding war among a host of established studios and producers. David Brown and Richard D. Zanuck made the first bid of $75,000. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer initially offered $300,000, financed by Paramount Pictures, but backed down when bids climbed to $750,000. Peter Guber and Jon Peters, and Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg of Mirage Enterprises made $1 million bids of their own money. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Irwin Winkler also made bids, while Universal Pictures passed on the project. After Pollack and Rosenberg acquired the rights in December 1986, United Artists negotiated with the producers to finance and distribute the film. In May 1987, Pollack hired Frank Pierson to write the script. Shortly after, United Artists backed out as a distributor. Roger Birnbaum, head of worldwide production for United Artists, claimed that the studio found the project &quot;just too expensive&quot;. In July 1988, the project moved to Warner Bros.

Pollack and Rosenberg sent the script to Alan J. Pakula, who felt that it needed improvement and spent a year rewriting it with Pierson. Regarding the screenwriting process, Turow said, &quot;There were three large narrative problems to solve. Point of view; getting around the first person narrative; time sequence; it&#x27;s all flashback and Hollywood doesn&#x27;t like that; and then just an awful lot of plot.&quot; Pierson originally envisioned the film adaptation as being &quot;a movie full of sex and blood&quot;. Pakula felt that the concept of justice was more central to the story. He also wanted to present the film in a visual style that echoed the novel&#x27;s narrative. In making various changes from the novel, Pakula and Pierson added new dialogue and rewrote the ending. Pakula signed on to direct the film in January 1989.

===Casting===
Several established actors were considered for the leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an &quot;Everyman quality&quot; that best suited the character. Ford&#x27;s casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing a few of the actor&#x27;s films. Ford said, &quot;Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty&#x27;s in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him.&quot; Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, &quot;There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they&#x27;ve seen before.&quot;

In preparing for their roles, the actors were granted access to lawyers who would act as advisors. Ford observed murder trials with Pakula at the Recorder&#x27;s Court in Detroit and viewed training footage from the Michigan Prosecutors&#x27; Association. Greta Scacchi, who plays Carolyn Polhemus, observed Linda Fairstein, head of the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s sex crimes unit. Raúl Juliá, who plays Sandy Stern, researched his role by meeting with criminal lawyer Michael Kennedy. Paul Winfield lobbied for the role of Judge Larren Lyttle upon reading the novel and learning that the adaptation was to be directed by Pakula. Winfield met with New York Supreme Court judge Bruce M. Wright, who insisted that he wear a judiciary robe and observe several cases.

This is the first film role for Jeffrey Wright and Joseph Mazzello.

===Filming===
Pakula spent three weeks rehearsing with the actors before principal photography commenced on July 31, 1989, with a budget of $20 million. Filming began in Detroit, where the production first filmed exterior scenes. Locations included the Renaissance Center&#x27;s Westin Hotel, Philip A. Hart Plaza, the Woodbridge Tavern, Eastern Market, Jackie&#x27;s Bar and Restaurant, St. Aubin Marina, and the International Plaza garage rooftop. On August 3, 1989, the production moved to Reaume Park in Windsor, Ontario for a 13-hour shoot. After filming in Detroit ended on August 9, 1989, the production moved to Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. The filmmakers constructed a courtroom modeled after one in Cleveland, Ohio, that was unavailable for filming. The production then moved to Newark, New Jersey. For two days, the North Reformed Church was used to depict the funeral of Carolyn Polhemus. From August 14 to August 15, the filmmakers shot scenes at Newark City Hall. The Essex County Veterans Courthouse was used for a brief courtroom sequence, and Newark&#x27;s city morgue was used to depict the medical office of Dr. Kumagai. A housing project scheduled for demolition was used for a scene depicting Rusty and Detective Lipranzer&#x27;s interrogation of a suspect.

In late August, the crew relocated to Allendale, New Jersey. A suburban house on East Orchard Street was used to film exterior and interior scenes set in the Sabich family home. The house&#x27;s cellar was used to film a scene involving Rusty and his wife. The cast and crew then returned to Kaufman Astoria Studios to film the trial scenes. Principal photography concluded on October 24, 1989.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 86% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Thanks to an outstanding script, focused direction by Alan Pakula, and a riveting performance from Harrison Ford, &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; is the kind of effective courtroom thriller most others aspire to be.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 72% based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Warner Bros. requested in press releases that critics not discuss the film&#x27;s ending. Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; surmised, &quot;It&#x27;s not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It&#x27;s that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty&#x27;s innocence in his review. He wrote, &quot;Carolyn&#x27;s murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her ... But it is hard to accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated, &quot;Even if you think you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay ... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong.&quot;

Sheila Benson, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, stated, &quot;Intelligent, complex and enthralling, &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; ... is one of those rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the machinery never shows and after it&#x27;s over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction.&quot; Peter Travers, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called the film &quot;a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Pakula&#x27;s direction, writing, &quot;Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow&#x27;s story.&quot; Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was &quot;a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven&#x27;t read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised the performances, writing, &quot;Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the supporting cast, writing, &quot;Raul Julia is excellent as Ford&#x27;s sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, criticized Pakula&#x27;s direction, stating, &quot;Pakula is good at laying out an intricate, almost mathematical series of events (his best film remains &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;), but he&#x27;s not big on atmosphere. The movie could have used some of the bowels-of-the-city grit Sidney Lumet brought to &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;.&quot; Dave Kehr, also writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, stated, &quot;Though it&#x27;s a handsome film, carefully staged and courageously low-key, the transition to the screen only exaggerates the disposable nature of the material while depriving it of the novel&#x27;s one stylistic strength, its unreliable narrator.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; received several nominations, with particular recognition for its screenplay by Alan J. Pakula and Frank Pierson. The film received an Edgar Allan Poe Award nomination for Best Motion Picture, and a USC Scripter Award nomination for Pakula, Pierson and the novel by Turow.

==Other iterations==
===Miniseries===

&quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; was followed by a two-part television miniseries, &quot;The Burden of Proof&quot; (1992). Based on Turow&#x27;s 1990 novel, the miniseries focuses on defense attorney Sandy Stern (played by Héctor Elizondo), who investigates his wife&#x27;s past following her apparent suicide. &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; co-star Brian Dennehy appeared in a separate role as Stern&#x27;s brother-in-law. The first chapter of the miniseries aired on the ABC network on February 9, 1992, with the second part airing the following night on February 10.

===Television film===

A television sequel, &quot;Innocent&quot; (2011), was based on Turow&#x27;s 2010 sequel novel to &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;. Set twenty years after the events of the 1990 film, the story follows Rusty Sabich (Bill Pullman), who is charged with the murder of his wife Barbara (Marcia Gay Harden). &quot;Innocent&quot; aired on TNT on November 30, 2011, as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Movie Night&quot;, a collection of six made-for-television films based on best-selling novels.

===Television series===

Apple TV+ produced an eight-part miniseries based on the film, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Rusty Sabich. The miniseries debuted on June 12, 2024.

<doc id="1189805" wikidata="Q17018150" url="?curid=1189805" title="On Being the Right Size">
<text>&quot;On Being the Right Size&quot; is a 1926 essay by J. B. S. Haldane which discusses proportions in the animal world and the essential link between the size of an animal and these systems an animal has for life. It was published as one of Haldane&#x27;s collected essays in &quot;Possible Worlds and Other Essays&quot;.

==Thesis==
Haldane&#x27;s thesis is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have:

Many of his examples are based on the square–cube law, although he does not use that terminology.

The bigger an animal gets, the more it would have to change its physical shape, but the weaker it would become.

==Influence==
This link has become known as &quot;Haldane&#x27;s principle&quot; (not to be confused with Richard Burton Haldane&#x27;s Haldane principle), being referred to as such by urban planning theorist Jane Jacobs.

Another planning theorist, Christopher Alexander, refers to this principle in his theory of &quot;Independent Regions&quot; in &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;, citing Haldane:

<doc id="1189806" wikidata="Q6777586" url="?curid=1189806" title="Martyn &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury">
<text>Martyn &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Bradbury (born 1974) is a New Zealand media commentator, former radio and TV host, and former executive producer of Alt TV – a now-defunct alternative music and culture channel. He is a blogger that writes at the blogs &quot;Tumeke! &quot;and &quot;The Daily Blog&quot;. Bradbury was given the nickname &#x27;Bomber&#x27; by a former &quot;Craccum&quot; editor, reputedly to describe his bombastic personality. He has been described by the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; as the &quot;most opinionated man in New Zealand&quot;. He has defended his decision to block a number of women on social media and referred to reasons for disputes with five women who previously contributed to &quot;The Daily Blog&quot;.

==Print media==
Bradbury was the elected editor of the Auckland University Students&#x27; Association&#x27;s (AUSA) &quot;Craccum&quot; magazine for the 1997 year, and elected co-editor with Stuart Gardiner for the 1995 year. Before that he was the poetry editor. According to Bradbury, he picked up the nickname &quot;Bomber&quot; from one of the editors of &quot;Craccum&quot;.

Bradbury is a former editor (2004–05) of New Zealand music magazine &quot;Rip It Up&quot;.

==Radio==
Prior to his television work Bradbury was the host of the &#x27;Late night talk lounge&#x27; on defunct alternative music station Channel Z from 1996 until 1998, as well as a regular DJ during various time slots. Until late 2011, he was a guest on various panel discussions on &quot;Afternoons with Jim Mora&#x27; on Radio New Zealand (RNZ).

=== Radio New Zealand saga ===
After a regular guest spot on RNZ&#x27;s show &quot;The Panel&quot;, the network withdrew an invitation for Bradbury to return as a panellist. While Bradbury claimed he had been &quot;banned&quot; for criticising the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, RNZ said he had not been banned, and that he had been removed as a panellist after breaching their editorial policy. According to Radio NZ &quot;Mr Bradbury’s comments were inconsistent with information that he had provided to programme producers before going on air. Mr Bradbury later apologised to the programme’s executive producer. It was made clear to him that while his invitation to appear as an occasional guest on The Panel was being withdrawn, it was not a &#x27;lifelong ban&#x27; and it did not apply to other Radio New Zealand programmes&quot;.

==Television==
Bradbury hosted &quot;Bomber&#x27;s Blog – the war on news&quot;, on Triangle TV – renamed Face TV before it disbanded. He hosted an investigative television series called &quot;Stake-Out&quot; which used hidden cameras to catch people in the act of committing criminal or immoral acts on film. He hosted &quot;Citizen A&quot; on Face TV.

==Politics==
===Mana Movement===
Martyn Bradbury was a consultant to the Mana party until 2013, and provided a draft strategy document for the Kim Dotcom Internet Party in 2014. He was influential in promoting public opposition to expansion of GCSB spying powers.

===Colin Craig defamation trial===

On 23 September 2016, Martyn Bradbury testified as a defence witness in Jordan Williams&#x27; defamation trial against Colin Craig, the former leader of the Conservative Party. Williams, the co-founder of the New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union had filed a defamation suit against Craig after the latter had produced a pamphlet entitled &quot;Dirty Politics and Hidden Agenda&quot; attacking Williams, the right-wing blogger Cameron Slater, and a dissident Party member John Stringer. In his testimony, Bradbury alleged that Williams had embarked on a political hit job against Craig and defended Craig&#x27;s pamphlet. Bradbury described the trial as &quot;an angry fight between two people who don&#x27;t like each other much.&quot; Bradbury was also questioned by Williams&#x27; lawyer Peter McKnight for making alleged defamatory comments against Williams in &quot;The Daily Blog&quot;. Some in the media credited Bradbury for the extent of damages awarded to Williams.

==Views and positions==
===South Canterbury Finance bubble===
Bradbury was highly critical of the late finance company owner Alan Hubbard, whose company was placed under statutory management by the-then Justice Minister Simon Power.

===Conversion therapy ban legislation===

In response to the Government&#x27;s proposed conversion practices legislation in 2021 which seeks to ban gay conversion therapy, Bradbury criticised bill&#x27;s five year prison term as form of &quot;government overreach&quot; which distracted from the Government&#x27;s failure to address what he regarded as their failed mental health, poverty and housing policies.

<doc id="1189822" wikidata="Q11187462" url="?curid=1189822" title="Korean language and computers">
<text>The writing system of the Korean language is a syllabic alphabet of character parts () organized into character blocks () representing syllables. The character parts cannot be written from left to right on the computer, as in many Western languages. Every possible syllable in Korean would have to be rendered as syllable blocks by a font, or each character part would have to be encoded separately. Unicode has both options; the character parts (h) and (a), and the combined syllable (ha), are encoded.

== Character encoding ==

In , a method known as ISO-2022-KR for seven-bit encoding of Korean characters in email was described. Where eight bits are allowed, EUC-KR encoding is preferred. These two encodings combine US-ASCII (ISO 646) with the Korean standard KS X 1001:1992 (previously named KS C 5601:1987). Another character set, KPS 9566 (similar to KS X 1001), is used in North Korea.

The international Unicode standard contains special characters for the Korean language in the Hangul phonetic system. Unicode supports two methods. The method used by Microsoft Windows is to have each of the 11,172 syllable combinations as code and a preformed font character. The other method encodes letters (&quot;jamos&quot;) and lets the software combine them correctly. The Windows method requires more font memory but allows better shapes, since it is complicated to create stylistically correct combinations (preferable for documents).

Another possibility is stacking a sequence of medial(s) (&quot;jungseong&quot;) and a sequence of final(s) (&quot;jongseong&quot;) or a Middle Korean pitch mark (if needed) on top of the sequence of initial(s) (&quot;choseong&quot;) if the font has medial and final &quot;jamos&quot; with zero-width spacing inserted to the left of the cursor or caret, thus appearing in the right place below (or to the right of) the initial. If a syllable has a horizontal medial (, , , or ), the initial will probably appear further left in a complete syllable than in preformed syllables due to the space that must be reserved for a vertical medial, making aesthetically poor what may be the only way to display Middle Korean hangul text without resorting to images, romanization, replacement of obsolete jamo or non-standard encodings. However, most current fonts do not support this.

The Unicode standard also has attempted to create a unified CJK character set which can represent Chinese (Hanzi) and the Japanese (Kanji) and Korean (Hanja) derivatives of this script through Han unification, which does not discriminate by language or region in rendering Chinese characters if the typographic traditions have not resulted in major differences in what a character looks like. Han unification has been criticized.

== Hangul type, Korean typewriters ==

While the first Korean typewriter, or 한글 타자기, is unclear,the first &quot;Moa-Sugi&quot; style (모아쓰기,The form of hangul where consonants and vowels come together to form a letter; The standard form of Hangul used today) typewriter is thought to be first invented by Korean-American gyopo Lee Won-Ik (이원익) in 1914, where he modified a Smith Premier 10 typewriter&#x27;s type into Hangul. Alongside Lee Won-ik&#x27;s, Horace Grant Underwood&#x27;s 1913 US-patented Hangul type, &quot;the Underwood,&quot; and another Korean-American Kim Jun-Sung&#x27;s Hangul type are also brought up when discussing the first &quot;Moa-Sugi&quot; type.

In 1929, the first Dubeolsik typewriter was made by Song Ki-Ju, a student studying abroad in the US, gaining attention from the Donga ilbo, however, it no longer exists; In 1934 he showcased another type, which was a modification of the &quot;Underwood portable&quot;. Song&#x27;s 1934 typewriter is stored in the Hangul museum as the oldest existing Korean typewriter. The invention led to the development of other typewriters in 1945 by Kim Joon Sung and 1950 by Kong Byung Woo.

In 1949, eye doctor Kong Byung-Woo made the first practical Hangul type able to write both in &quot;Moa-Sugi&quot; and horizontally.

== Modern text input ==

On a Korean computer keyboard, text is typically entered by pressing a key for the appropriate jamo; the operating system creates each composite character on the fly. Depending on the Input method editor and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the shift button. When all jamo making up a syllabic block has been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to hanja (or other special characters) using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a key for this. Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported in varying degrees by word processors.

When using a keyboard with another language, most operating systems require the user to type with an original Korean keyboard layout; the most common is Dubeolsik. In other languages, such as Japanese, text can be entered on non-native keyboards with romanization.

Operating systems such as Linux allow &quot;engine/hangul/hangul-keyboard=&#x27;ro&quot;, resulting in a romaja keyboard; typing &quot;seonggye&quot; results in 성계. In this configuration, ㄲ is obtained by &quot;gg&quot; rather than . This allows keying &quot;jasanGun&quot; to obtain 자산군, instead of keying &quot;jasangun&quot; (which would provide 자상운).

=== Before Korean division ===
Korean text input is related to Korean typewriters (타자기) before computers. according to Jang Bong Seon, Horace Grant Underwood made a Korean typewriter during the first decade of the 20th century. In 1927, Song Ki Joo invented the first Dubeolsik typewriter in Chicago; h

=== After division ===
South Korea originally had a Nebeolsik standard, but Dubeolsik became standard in 1985.

== Hanja ==
Some Korean fonts do not include hanja, and word processors do not allow a user to specify which font to use as a fallback for any hanja in a text; each hanja sequence must be manually formatted for a desired font.

== Pitch marks and vertical text ==
Vertical text is supported poorly (or not at all) by HTML and most word processors. This is not an issue for modern Korean, which is usually written horizontally; until the second half of the 20th century, however, Korean was often written vertically. Fifteenth-century texts written in hangul had pitch marks to the left of syllables which are included in Unicode, although current fonts do not support them.

== Programs ==

Programs designed for Korean language-related use include:
* Language recognition
** A North Korean speech recognition program is said to recognize 100,000 words, with a success rate of over 90 percent.
** &quot;Mongnan&quot; (; Korea Computer Center, North Korea) Optical character recognition software, with a reported success rate of 99 percent for printed text and 95 percent for handwriting recognition.
* Input method editors
** &quot;Tan&#x27;gun&quot; (; Pyongyang Information Center, North Korea) Allows hangul on English versions of Windows.
** Korean IME (Microsoft) Allows hangul on all versions of Windows.
** Nalgaeset Hangul Input Method Editor (날개셋 한글 입력기); Kim Yongmook, South Korea) A hangul input method developed for the sebeolsik (3-set style) Windows keyboard layout 
** &quot;Nabi&quot; (), &quot;ami&quot; (; South Korea)Permits hangul on Linux
** m17nPermits revised romanization for hangul input on Unix
** SCIM and IBusPermits hangul and hanja input on POSIX operating systems (including Linux and BSD)
* Word processorsThe following programs include domestic hangul fonts, non-hangul fonts and a hangul-hanja conversion utility.

** Changdok (; PIC, North Korea)MS-DOS program developed in April 1990; a Windows version was developed in 1996. It has a personality-cult feature in which pressing or produces titles praising Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, respectively.

== Hangul in Unicode ==


Hangul letters are detailed in several parts of Unicode:

* Hangul Syllables (AC00–D7A3)
* Hangul Jamo (1100–11FF)
* Hangul Compatibility Jamo (3130–318F)
* Hangul Jamo Extended-A (A960–A97F)
* Hangul Jamo Extended-B (D7B0–D7FF)

=== Hangul syllables block ===
Pre-composed hangul syllables in the Unicode hangul syllables block are algorithmically defined with the following formula:
: [(initial) × 588 + (medial) × 28 + (final)] + 44032

* Initial consonants
* Medial vowels
* Final consonants
To find the code point of &quot;한&quot; in Unicode:

* The value of the initial consonant (ㅎ) is 18.
* The value of the medial vowel (ㅏ) is 0.
* The value of the final consonant (ㄴ) is 4.

Substituting these values in the formula above yields [(18 × 588) + (0 × 28) + 4] + 44032 = 54620. The Unicode value of 한 is 54620 in decimal, codice_1 in numeric character reference, and U+D55C in hexadecimal Unicode notation.

==== How to code this in Rust ====

With the below module, calling e.g. hangul::from_jamo(&#x27;ㅎ&#x27;, &#x27;ㅏ&#x27;, Some(&#x27;ㄴ&#x27;)) will return Some(&#x27;한&#x27;).

=== Hangul Compatibility Jamo block ===
The Unicode Hangul Compatibility Jamo block has been allocated for compatibility with the KS X 1001 character set. It is usually used to represent hangul without distinguishing initials and finals.

=== Hangul Jamo blocks ===
The Hangul Jamo, Hangul Jamo Extended-A and Hangul Jamo Extended-B blocks contain initial, medial and final jamo, including obsolete jamo.

=== Hanyang Private Use Area code ===
Hangul (word processor) shipped with fonts from Hanyang Information and Communication, which map obsolete hangul characters with Unicode&#x27;s Private Use Areas. Despite the use of PUAs instead of dedicated code points, Hanyang&#x27;s mapping was the most popular way to represent obsolete hangul in South Korea in 2007. With its Hangul 2010, however, Hancom deprecated Hanyang PUA code and began representing obsolete hangul characters with Unicode hangul jamo.

<text>St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital is a 250-bed chronic care hospital located in East Hamilton, Ontario specializing in the care of older adults. The hospital became a part of Hamilton Health Sciences in 2008.

==Overview==
St. Peter’s Hospital is specializing in the delivery of complex care for adults with chronic illness. St. Peter’s provides inpatient, outpatient, and community-based programs and services that focus on Dementia, Aging, Palliative Care and Rehabilitation. It is also home to St. Peter’s Juravinski Research Centre where an interdisciplinary research team is focused on dementia.

St. Peter&#x27;s main campus is located at 88 Maplewood Avenue 3-blocks east of Sherman Avenue. Founded at this site by the Anglican Church in 1890 as &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Home for the Incurables&quot;, St. Peter&#x27;s now also oversees a long-term care facility on Hamilton Mountain. Construction work began in August 2007 on the new &quot;Alexander Pavilion&quot;, so-named for the financial contributions made by The Hon. Lincoln Alexander, above the western end of the main building. This structure will replace the aging south wing which housed the Behavioural Health unit. The relatively modern east and west wings house the remainder of Behavioural Health and the entirety of the Complex Continuing Care, Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and day hospital programs.

As a chronic care facility, St. Peter&#x27;s admits patients by referral and has no emergency department accessible to the public.

505 staff members support and deliver care to patients; clinical staff include nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, other specialized therapists, and physicians.

Hamilton Health Sciences Foundation raises funds to support St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital including: equipment, facilities, research and staff education.

<text>The machine tractor station (MTS) (, , МТС) was a state enterprise for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery that were used in kolkhozy (collective farms operated by the government). Each MTS was responsible for around 40 kolkhozy. The first ever MTS was organized in the Odesa Oblast (Shevchenkivska MTS). MTSs were introduced in 1928 as a shared resource of scarce agricultural machinery and technical personnel.

William Taubman, Khrushchev&#x27;s biographer, describes them as follows:
As the name implies, the MTSs were rural agencies that supplied collective farms with agricultural machinery and people to run it. They were set up in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the kolkhozy were too weak and disorganized to manage their own equipment. Ideologically, collective farms were a &quot;lesser&quot; form of property (since theoretically they belonged to the collective rather than the state as a whole); hence it would not do to have them own part of the &quot;means of production.&quot; Politically, the new collective farms, into which so many peasants were dragooned, were unreliable. So the MTS also served as a party (and police) stronghold in the countryside.
The main units of an MTS were &quot;tractor brigades&quot; and &quot;automobile brigades&quot;, which performed the corresponding agricultural work. It was paid with the share of the agricultural product called &quot;natural payment&quot; (, &quot;naturoplata&quot;). Over time, MTSs became an instrument of transferring the agricultural production from kolkhozy to the sovkhozy of the state. 75,000 tractors had been supplied by MTSs to Soviet collective farms by 1932, and in 1933 the natural payment constituted about 20% of the product and continued to grow.

They existed as independent inter-kolkhoz service until 1958, when the machinery was transferred to the farms, and MTS transformed into machinery service stations (), which were still known under the old name for longer time. In 1972 they were further renamed into Regional Association &quot;Selkhoztekhnika&quot; (, an abbreviation for , agricultural machinery).

In post-Soviet Russia some economists expressed ideas about the revival of MTSs to help small independent farmers.

<text>The 1935 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 25th term. It resulted in the Labour Party&#x27;s first electoral victory, with Michael Joseph Savage becoming the first Labour Prime Minister after defeating the governing coalition, consisting of the United Party and the Reform Party, in a landslide—to date, the worst defeat of a sitting government in New Zealand history.

The governing coalition lost 31 seats, which was attributed by many to their handling of the Great Depression: the year after the election, the United and Reform parties merged to form the modern National Party.

The election was originally scheduled to be held in 1934, in keeping with the country&#x27;s three-year election cycle, but the governing coalition postponed the election by one year hoping that the economic conditions would improve by 1935.

==Background==
Since 1931, New Zealand had been governed by a coalition of the United Party and the Reform Party, the United–Reform Coalition. United and Reform had traditionally been enemies – United was a revival of the old Liberal Party, a progressive party with a strong urban base, while Reform was a conservative party with a strong rural base. When the 1928 elections left United and Reform with an equal number of seats, United managed to obtain support from the growing Labour Party, but in 1931, the worsening depression prompted a dispute over economic policy, and Labour withdrew its backing. Reform then agreed to go into coalition with United, fearing that an election would lead to significant gains for the &quot;socialistic&quot; Labour. The coalition held on to power in the 1931 elections, but the ongoing economic troubles made the government deeply unpopular, and by the time of the 1935 elections, Labour&#x27;s support was soaring.

==Campaign==
&quot;The Dominion&quot;, a Wellington newspaper, printed anti-Labour advertisements and editorials. On Sunday 24 November, shortly before the election, an address by Colin Scrimgeour (&quot;Uncle Scrim&quot;) on the &quot;Friendly Road&quot; radio station, which was expected to urge listeners to vote Labour, was jammed by the Post Office.

==The election==
The number of electorates being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since the 1902 Electoral Redistribution.

Four of those were Māori electorates, and those elections were held on 26 November. 19 candidates contested the four available positions, and in three out of four cases, the incumbents were returned.

The election in the European electorates was held on the following day, a Wednesday. A total of 246 candidates contested the 76 European electorates, between two and six per electorate ( had six candidates, and there was a contest in all electorates), i.e. an average of 3.2 candidates per electorate. 919,798 people were registered to vote in European electorates (enrolment data for Māori electorates are only available since the ), and there was a turnout of 90.75%. This turnout was considerably higher than the turnout in the previous election (84.26%) and the highest turnout so far, but still about average for the next decades.

Elsie Andrews (1888–1948) was one of only three women who stood for election in this year.

==Results==

===Summary===
The 1935 election saw a massive win for the opposition Labour Party, which won fifty-three seats, and formed the First Labour Government. The governing coalition won only nineteen, and three ministers were defeated (in Hamilton, Tauranga and Waitaki). This difference was not so great in the popular vote, however, with Labour winning 45.7% to the coalition&#x27;s 33.5%. Labour was more fortunate than its British namesake in not attaining office before the depression (thanks to Seddon&#x27;s lengthy reign) &quot;and so could hold the conservative coalition responsible if natural laws of economics behaved unnaturally&quot;.

Apart from Labour and the coalition, the only two groups to win places in Parliament were the Country Party and the Ratana movement, both of which won two seats.

Four independents were elected, Harry Atmore, David McDougall, Charles Wilkinson and Robert Wright. The independents were tactically supported by one of the major parties who did not stand a candidate against them, and they generally voted with that party; Wilkinson and Wright supported the coalition while Atmore and McDougall supported Labour. Labour also did not stand candidates against the two Country Party members.

Many commentators blamed the coalition&#x27;s failure to win seats on vote splitting by the Democrat Party, an &quot;anti-socialist&quot; group founded by a former organiser for the governing coalition, Albert Davy, and headed by Thomas Hislop, the Mayor of Wellington. Perhaps as many as eight seats were an unexpected bonus to Labour because of the three-way split. The Democrats won 7.8% of the vote, but no seats.

Two future National MPs stood unsuccessfully: Frederick Doidge stood as an Independent for and came second, and Matthew Oram stood for the Democrats in and came fourth.

An analysis of men and women on the rolls against the votes recorded showed that in 1935 90.75% of those on the European rolls voted; men 92.02% and women 89.46%. In the the figures were 92.85% with men 93.43% and women 92.27%. As the Māori electorates did not have electoral rolls they could not be included.

==Post-election events==
A number of local by-elections were required due to the resignations of incumbent local body politicians following the general election:

* In February 1936 Dan Sullivan resigned as Mayor of Christchurch owing to a heavy workload after becoming a cabinet minister following Labour&#x27;s victory. This sparked two by-elections, one for the mayoralty and another for three vacancies on the city council. Sullivan was replaced by John Beanland. Among the successful city council candidates was Robert Macfarlane who had contested Christchurch North in 1935.
* Likewise Peter Fraser resigned his seat on the Wellington City Council in order to focus on his new ministerial duties. A by-election was avoided however when Andrew Parlane, the highest polling unsuccessful candidate from the previous election, was the only nominated candidate.
* Later in the parliamentary term Fred Jones resigned his membership of the Dunedin City Council due to his ministerial obligations. An appointment was made instead of holding a by-election with Ralph Harrison succeeding Jones.

<text>Rip It Up was a bi-monthly New Zealand music magazine that was published from 1977 to 2015.

==History and profile==
Started in June 1977 as a free monthly giveaway, it grew rapidly, with its monthly print run reaching 30,000 copies by the mid-1980s. The new magazine arrived at an opportune moment, with the musical revolutions of punk rock and new wave arriving in New Zealand in the first few years of its existence - two genres which the new magazine was to champion, alongside local music trends such as the Dunedin sound. For many years it was unequalled as a New Zealand source of information on rock music. The magazine&#x27;s back-catalogue also provides an unrivalled reference for information about the history of New Zealand&#x27;s rock music.

The brainchild of Murray Cammick and Alistair Dougal, &quot;Rip It Up&quot; was circulated free via record shops for fourteen years as a music rag produced on a meagre budget. In 1991 the physical quality of the publication improved, making the transition from newsprint to a gloss medium, a direct result of the NZ$2 charge.

==Editors==
Murray Cammick was the first editor of the magazine and ran it virtually single-handedly for several years. Other editors have included David Long, now a sports journalist at Fairfax Media, Scott Kara, who later worked for the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot;, Martyn &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury (radio and television host), who left &quot;Rip it Up&quot; in 2005, and Phil Bell (AKA DJ Sir-Vere), who left in August 2011 to become the programme director for popular urban radio station Mai FM.

&quot;Rip It Up&quot; ceased publication in 2015. The archives and the name are owned by Simon Grigg.

<doc id="1189850" wikidata="Q423343" url="?curid=1189850" title="Active–stative alignment">
<text>In linguistic typology, active–stative alignment (also split intransitive alignment or semantic alignment) is a type of morphosyntactic alignment in which the sole argument (&quot;subject&quot;) of an intransitive clause (often symbolized as &quot;S&quot;) is sometimes marked in the same way as an agent of a transitive verb (that is, like a subject such as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;she&quot; in English) but other times in the same way as a direct object (such as &quot;me&quot; or &quot;her&quot; in English). Languages with active–stative alignment are often called &quot;active languages&quot;.

The case or agreement of the intransitive argument (&quot;S&quot;) depends on semantic or lexical criteria particular to each language. The criteria tend to be based on the degree of volition, or control over the verbal action exercised by the participant.

For example, if one tripped and fell, an active–stative language might require one to say the equivalent of &quot;fell me.&quot; To say &quot;I fell&quot; would mean that the person had done it on purpose, such as taking a fall in boxing. Another possibility is empathy; for example, if someone&#x27;s dog were run over by a car, one might say the equivalent of &quot;died her.&quot; To say &quot;she died&quot; would imply that the person was not affected emotionally.

If the core arguments of a transitive clause are termed &quot;A&quot; (agent of a transitive verb) and &quot;P&quot; (patient of a transitive verb), active–stative languages can be described as languages that align intransitive &quot;S&quot; as &quot;S = P/O∗∗&quot; (&quot;fell me&quot;) or &quot;S = A&quot; (&quot;I fell&quot;), depending on the criteria described above.

Active–stative languages contrast with accusative languages such as English that generally align &quot;S&quot; as &quot;S = A&quot;, and to ergative languages that generally align &quot;S&quot; as &quot;S = P/O&quot;.

==Types==

For most such languages, the case of the intransitive argument is lexically fixed for each verb, regardless of the actual degree of volition of the subject, but often corresponding to the most typical situation. For example, the argument of &quot;swim&quot; may always be treated like the transitive subject (agent-like), and the argument of &quot;sleep&quot; like the transitive direct object (patient-like). In Dakota, arguments of active verbs such as &quot;to run&quot; are marked like transitive agents, as in accusative languages, and arguments of inactive verbs such as &quot;to stand&quot; are marked like transitive objects, as in ergative languages. In such language, if the subject of a verb like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;swallow&quot; is defined as agentive, it will be always marked so even if the action of swallowing is involuntary. This subtype is sometimes known as split-S.

In other languages, the marking of the intransitive argument is decided by the speaker, based on semantic considerations. For any given intransitive verb, the speaker may choose whether to mark the argument as agentive or patientive. In some of these languages, agentive marking encodes a degree of volition or control over the action, with the patientive used as the default case; in others, patientive marking encodes a lack of volition or control, suffering from or being otherwise affected by the action, or sympathy on the part of the speaker, with the agentive used as the default case. These two subtypes (&quot;patientive-default&quot; and &quot;agentive-default&quot;) are sometimes known as fluid-S.

==Argument marking==
If the language has morphological case, the arguments of a transitive verb are marked by using the agentive case for the subject and the patientive case for the object. The argument of an intransitive verb may be marked as either.

Languages lacking case inflections may indicate case by different word orders, verb agreement, using adpositions, etc. For example, the patientive argument might precede the verb, and the agentive argument might follow the verb.

Cross-linguistically, the agentive argument tends to be marked, and the patientive argument tends to be unmarked. That is, if one case is indicated by zero-inflection, it is often the patientive.

Additionally, active languages differ from ergative languages in how split case marking intersects with Silverstein&#x27;s (1976) nominal hierarchy:
:pronouns (1st&gt;2nd&gt;3rd person) &gt; proper nouns &gt; common nouns (human &gt; animate &gt; inanimate)
Specifically, ergative languages with split case marking are more likely to use ergative rather than accusative marking for NPs lower down the hierarchy (to the right), whereas active languages are more likely to use active marking for NPs higher up the hierarchy (to the left), like first and second person pronouns. Dixon states that &quot;In active languages, if active marking applies to an NP type a, it applies to every NP type to the left of a on the nominal hierarchy.&quot;

==Terminology==
Active languages are a relatively new field of study. Active morphosyntactic alignment used to be not recognized as such, and it was treated mostly as an interesting deviation from the standard alternatives (nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive). Also, active languages are few and often show complications and special cases (&quot;pure&quot; active alignment is an ideal).

Thus, the terminology used is rather flexible. The morphosyntactic alignment of active languages is also termed &quot;active–stative alignment&quot; or &quot;semantic alignment&quot;. The terms &quot;agentive case&quot; and &quot;patientive case&quot; used above are sometimes replaced by the terms &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot;.

===Caucasus===
* Georgian (spoken in the Caucasian nation of Georgia): generally considered a split ergative language, but Alice Harris has claimed that it shows active alignment in some verb paradigms (namely, that the ergative marker appears to apply to active-intransitive verbs; also stative experiencers take a different case marking and agreement pattern). However, even that is complicated by the existence of apparently-inactive intransitive verbs taking such marking, such as the verb meaning &#x27;to boil&#x27;. Other Kartvelian languages such Laz, Svan, and Old Georgian show similar systems, while the position of Mingrelian is more controversial.
* Northeast Caucasian languages: Tsova-Tush: according to Holisky (1987), there are 31 intransitive verbs for which the argument is always marked as patientive and refer to uncontrollable states (&quot;be hungry&quot;, &quot;tremble&quot;, etc.), and 78 intransitive verbs with an agentive argument (&quot;walk&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;think&quot;). They form a split-S subset of the verbs. The rest of the verbs form a fluid-S system; for instance, a single verb root can be interpreted as &quot;slip&quot; when it is used with a patientive argument and as &quot;slide&quot; with an agentive argument.
* Tabasaran

===Siberia===
* Ket, a Yeniseian language (split-S)
* Yukaghir languages (fluid-S, based on focus and discourse-pragmatic factors)

===Reconstructed proto-languages===
According to Castro Alves (2010), a split-S alignment can be safely reconstructed for Proto-Northern Jê finite clauses. Clauses headed by a non-finite verb, on the contrary, would have been aligned ergatively in this reconstructed language.

The reconstructed Pre-Proto-Indo-European language, not to be confused with the Proto-Indo-European language, its direct descendant, shows many features known to correlate with active alignment like the animate vs. inanimate distinction, related to the distinction between active and inactive or stative verb arguments. Even in its descendant languages, there are traces of a morphological split between volitional and nonvolitional verbs, such as a pattern in verbs of perception and cognition where the argument takes an oblique case (called quirky subject), a relic of which can be seen in Middle English &quot;methinks&quot; or in the distinction between &quot;see&quot; vs. &quot;look&quot; or &quot;hear&quot; vs. &quot;listen&quot;. Other possible relics from a structure, in descendant languages of Indo-European, include conceptualization of possession and extensive use of particles.

<text>Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH) is a peer-reviewed medicines prescribing guide for Australian health professionals. The handbook is available in paper and digital formats and is supplemented by the &quot;AMH Aged Care Companion&quot; and the &quot;AMH Children&#x27;s Dosing Companion&quot;.

It is included in the Clinical Information Access Portal.

== Development ==
The AMH was first published in May 1998 driven by the need for a local, independent and up-to-date source of drug information to foster rational prescribing. Reflecting contemporary Australian clinical practice and adhering to the principles of the quality use of medicines, it is generally considered the Australian equivalent to the British National Formulary on which it was partly modelled.

AMH Pty Ltd, the publishing company created to develop and maintain the AMH content, is a professional partnership between three organisations: the Australasian Society of Clinical and Experimental Pharmacologists and Toxicologists, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.

<text>Magnolia fraseri, commonly known as Fraser magnolia, mountain magnolia, earleaf cucumbertree, or mountain-oread, is a species of magnolia native to the southeastern United States in the southern Appalachian Mountains and adjacent Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain from West Virginia to northern Florida and to eastern Texas. The Appalachian plants are classified as &quot;Magnolia fraseri&quot; var. &quot;fraseri,&quot; and the more coastal plants as &quot;M. fraseri&quot; var. &quot;pyramidata.&quot; These two kinds of magnolia are often recognized as distinct species, &quot;M. fraseri&quot; and &quot;M. pyramidata,&quot; respectively.

== Description ==
Fraser magnolia (named for Scottish botanist John Fraser) is a small, deciduous tree growing to 14 m (40 ft) tall, as a basal-branching, fragrant plant, with brown bark with a &quot;warty&quot; or &quot;scaly&quot; texture. The leaves are quite large, 15–25 cm (rarely up to 53 cm) long and 8–18 cm (rarely up to 29 cm) broad, with a pair of auricles (or &quot;ear-lobes&quot;) at the base and an entire margin; they are green above and glaucous blue-green below. The showy white flowers are 16–25 cm in diameter with nine tepals; they open in late spring or early summer, after the foliage. The fruit is a woody, oblong, cone-like structure (like all magnolias) 6.5–12 cm long, covered in small, pod-like follicles each containing one or two red seeds that hang out from the cone by a slender thread when ripe. A good seed crop occurs only about every 4–5 years. Reproduction is accomplished by both seed and vegetative sprouts. The fruit is eaten by wildlife, helping disperse the seeds. In the Appalachian Mountains, the Fraser Magnolia is a popular nest tree for the northern flying squirrel. 

The tree grows best on rich, moist, well-drained soil. The very large showy white flowers and large-leaved, coarse-textured foliage make it an attractive ornamental tree, but otherwise it has little commercial value. It is sometimes cultivated in North America as a native alternative to exotic magnolias and can be grown a considerable distance north of its natural range if given conditions favorable to its growth.

There are two varieties:
*&quot;Magnolia fraseri&quot; var. &quot;fraseri&quot;, native to the Appalachian Mountains.
*&quot;Magnolia fraseri&quot; var. &quot;pyramidata&quot; (Bartram) Pampanini, from the Coastal Plain. The vernacular name for this variety is Pyramid magnolia.

<doc id="1189880" wikidata="Q364746" url="?curid=1189880" title="Mark Andrews (politician)">
<text>Mark Andrews II (May 19, 1926 – October 3, 2020) was an American politician from the state of North Dakota. He was a member of the Republican Party who served in both chambers of the United States Congress, the United States House of Representatives from 1963 to 1981 and the United States Senate from 1981 to 1987.

==Life and career==
Andrews was born on May 19, 1926 in Cass County, North Dakota to Mark Andrews I and the former Lillian Hoyler, where he attended public school. In 1944 at the age of 18, Andrews was admitted to the United States Military Academy. He quit in 1946 after receiving a disability discharge. He then attended North Dakota State University at Fargo, North Dakota, where he became a member of the Gamma Tau chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and graduated in 1949.

Andrews then became a farmer. He was a third-generation farmer on a Red River Valley plot that was started by his grandfather.

=== Early political career ===
During the 1950s he began to enter politics, serving on farmers&#x27; organizations and Republican committees. In 1962, Andrews ran for Governor of North Dakota, losing to incumbent William L. Guy by 2,000 votes out of over 228,500 cast.

=== U.S. House ===
The next year, he became the Republican candidate for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from North Dakota when a special election was required after the death of Congressman Hjalmar Nygaard. Andrews won the election. He was reelected to a full term in 1964 and served in the House until 1981, being reelected every two years. Andrews supported Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican presidential primaries. During his time in the House, Andrews voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Regarding his support for civil rights legislation, Andrews said: &quot;It was the right thing to do. People needed to be treated with dignity.&quot; Andrews was one of thirty-one Republicans in the House to vote in favor of the Comprehensive Child Development Act of 1971.

=== Senate ===
In 1980, Andrews did not run for reelection to the House, but instead ran for the United States Senate seat being vacated by long-serving Republican Senator Milton Young, who was retiring. Andrews won the election with 70% of the vote and served in the Senate for one term, from 1981 to 1987. He was chairman of the select committee on Indian affairs from 1983 to 1987. As Senator and Representative, Andrews was socially moderate to liberal, opposing abortion bans and school prayer, and conservative on economic policies, but was also supportive of subsidies for farmers. Andrews was good friends with fellow North Dakota senator Quentin Burdick, U.S. Senate member Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and U.S. House of Representatives member Robert Bergland of Minnesota.

=== Career after Congress ===
In 1986, Andrews lost reelection to North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad by 2,120 votes in what was considered an upset, and subsequently retired from electoral politics. He started a consultancy firm in Washington, D.C., but lived in Mapleton, North Dakota. Grand Forks International Airport in Grand Forks, North Dakota, has sometimes been called Mark Andrews International Airport, but usage of the name has declined.

Despite North Dakota&#x27;s Republican bent at the presidential level, Andrews was the last Republican to represent the state in Congress until 2010, when Rick Berg was elected to the House and John Hoeven to the Senate.

Later in life, Andrews lamented the lack of bipartisanship in Congress, saying: &quot;People from both parties talked to each other in those days, and we got things done. It&#x27;s damn foolishness now. Nobody compromises anymore. Nobody gets things done now because they don&#x27;t work together.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Andrews married the former Mary Ann Willming on June 29, 1949. Together, they had three children, Mark Andrews III, Sarah, and Karen. On July 16, 2020, Mary Ann Willming Andrews died at age 93.

Andrews died on October 3, 2020, in Fargo, North Dakota, at age 94, 13 days less than three months after his wife&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1189885" wikidata="Q289738" url="?curid=1189885" title="André Rigaud">
<text>Benoit Joseph André Rigaud (17 January 1761 – 18 September 1811) was the leading mulatto military leader during the Haitian Revolution. Among his protégés were Alexandre Pétion and Jean-Pierre Boyer, both future presidents of Haïti.

==Early life==
Rigaud was born on 17 January 1761 in Les Cayes, Saint-Domingue, to André Rigaud, a wealthy French planter, and Rose Bossy Depa, a slave woman. His father acknowledged the mixed-race (mulatto) boy as his at a young age and sent him to Bordeaux, where he was trained as a goldsmith.

Rigaud was known to wear a brown-haired wig with straight hair to resemble a white man as closely as possible.

==Revolutionary==
After returning to Saint-Domingue from France, Rigaud became active in politics. He was a successor to Vincent Ogé and Julien Raimond as a champion of the interests of free people of color in Saint-Domingue, as colonial Haïti was known. Rigaud aligned himself with revolutionary France and an interpretation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen that ensured the civil equality of all free people.

By the mid-1790s, with slave uprisings in the North, Rigaud was leading an army, a force in the Ouest and Sud departments. He was given authority to govern by Étienne Polverel, one of the three French civil commissioners who had arrived in the colony. Rigaud&#x27;s power came from his influence with the free black and mulatto planters, found mostly in the South. They were fearful of the masses of former slaves, led by the likes of Romaine-la-Prophétesse, with whom Rigaud refused to ally, and sided instead with the French commissioners who abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue in 1793. Rigaud&#x27;s soldiers included blacks and whites.

In the South and the West, from 1793 to 1798, Rigaud aided in Toussaint Louverture&#x27;s decision to re-establish the plantation economy (albeit with paid labor as opposed to slave labor). Although Rigaud respected Louverture, the leading general of the former black slaves of the North and his superior rank in the French Revolutionary Army, he did not want to concede power in the South to him. Rigaud continued to believe in Saint-Domingue&#x27;s race-based caste system, which put mulattoes just below whites and left blacks at the bottom, a belief that put him at odds with Toussaint. That led to the bitter &quot;War of Knives&quot; (&quot;La Guerre des Couteaux&quot;) in June 1799, when Toussaint&#x27;s army invaded Rigaud&#x27;s territory. The Comte d&#x27;Hédouville, sent by France to govern the island, encouraged Rigaud&#x27;s rivalry with Toussaint. 

In 1800, Rigaud left Saint-Domingue for France after his defeat by Toussaint. On 1 October 1800, bound for France aboard the French schooner &quot;Diana&quot;, Rigaud became a prisoner-of-war when the &quot;Diana&quot; was captured by the USS &quot;Experiment&quot;. He was detained in Saint Kitts by the Americans and held there until he was released.

==Leclerc expedition==
Rigaud returned to Saint-Domingue in 1802 with the expedition of General Charles Leclerc, Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s brother-in-law, who was sent to unseat Toussaint and re-establish French colonial rule and slavery in Saint-Domingue. After the First French Republic abolished slavery in the colony in 1794 after the first slave uprising, the colonial system, based on exports of commodities from sugar cane and coffee plantations, had been undermined. Sugar production fell markedly, and many surviving white and mulatto planters left the island as refugees. Many emigrated to the United States, where they settled in southern cities such as Charleston, or to the Spanish colonies of Cuba or New Orleans. Leclerc was initially successful in capturing and deporting Toussaint, but Toussaint&#x27;s officers led the opposition by Haitian indigenous troops and fought on for two more years. Defeated by disease as well as Haitian resistance, France withdrew its 7,000 surviving troops in November 1803, less than one-third of the forces that had been sent there. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a black man from the North, led Saint-Domingue to victory and independence and declared Haiti the new name of the nation. He ultimately declared himself emperor.

Rigaud returned to France after the failure of the expedition in 1802–1803. For a time, he was held a prisoner in Fort de Joux, the same fortress as his rival, Toussaint, where the latter died in 1803.

==Final expedition==
Rigaud returned to Haiti a third time in December 1810. He established himself as &quot;President of the State of the South&quot;, in opposition to both Alexandre Pétion, a mulatto and former ally in the South, and Henri Christophe, a black man who took power in the North. Shortly after Rigaud&#x27;s death the following year, Pétion recovered power over the South. Rigaud&#x27;s tomb is on a small hill between Camp-Perrin and Les Cayes, which has been divided into two to allow a new road to ease transportation.

<text>Jesús David &quot;Jesse&quot; Vassallo Anadón (born August 9, 1961) is a former competition swimmer and world record-holder in the 200 and 400 individual medley, who participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics for the United States. In 1997, he became the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. He was somewhat unique in the scale of his achievements as a swimmer, and in a tribute to his World Records in 1978 was voted Swimming World Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Male Swimmer of the Year&quot;. From 2004 to 2009, he served as the president of the Puerto Rican National Swimming Federation (&quot;Federación Puertorriqueña de Natación&quot;).

== Early years ==
Vassallo Anadón is the third child of five siblings, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to the Vassallo Anadón family. He received his primary education at Academia Cristo Rey in Ponce. His sports-minded father, Victor Vassallo, who at one time played professional basketball, was the brother of the late Puerto Rican industrialist Salvador Vassallo, and encouraged his children to participate in sports. Vassallo Anadón&#x27;s brothers are Marcos, swimmer, businessman, and politician Víctor (b. 1960), Vicente, and swimmer Salvador (b. 1968).

On one occasion, while relaxing by a hotel swimming pool in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Vassallo&#x27;s father asked his sons to compete against some girls that were swimming laps in the pool. The father was impressed with what he saw, and as soon as he returned to Ponce he enrolled them in a local swimming team.

In 1971, at the age of 10, Vassallo&#x27;s father moved his family to Miami, Florida, where he was to open a branch of the family business, Vassallo Industries. Jesse began swimming with the Miami Hurricanes, an age-group team, under gifted coach Bill Diaz, who also coached the University of Miami swim team, where Vassallo would later have an exceptional college swimming career.

== Swimming competitions ==
Jesse took his first national record at age 13 in the 200m backstroke, and later broke a 50-meter backstroke swimming record. In 1975, he won his first gold medal in backstroke at the Medley Relay, held in Colombia. Vassallo held various records, including the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes, and the 200- and 400-meter individual medley. Vassallo already ranked among the top ten in the world in three of the events.

== U.S. Swimming Team ==
Realizing his son&#x27;s potential, Vassallo Anadón&#x27;s father moved to Mission Viejo, California, where Vassallo completed his secondary studies. He began training with the Mission Viejo Nadadores under Hall of Fame Coach Mark Schubert, who would later become the coach of the USA Swimming Team, University of Texas Women, University of Southern California, and the American Olympic Team. In 1976, Vassallo Anadón wanted to participate in the 1976 Summer Olympics, which were held in Montreal, Canada, representing Puerto Rico, but he could not participate due to a ruling of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee that stated that &quot;in order to represent Puerto Rico, a person must have resided on the island for at least a year&quot; (currently, this rule requires for a person to reside for three years before becoming a member of a Puerto Rican national sports team). He did however, participate in the U.S. Swimming Nationals at Philadelphia for the first time, and won his first national title and a national gold medal in the 1,500-meter freestyle.

In 1977, Vassallo Anadón traveled with the U.S. team, winning medals in New Zealand, the Netherlands and France. In 1978, Vassallo Anadón broke his first record in the 400-meter individual medley trials for the 1978 World Championships to be held in Berlin, Germany. In Berlin, he broke his record again and won two gold medals and a silver medal. In 1979, Vassallo Anadón broke his third world record in the 200-meter individual medley and won gold in the 1979 Pan American Games, held in San Juan. During the gold medal ceremony, Vassallo produced a small Puerto Rican flag which resulted in the entire crowd at the Escambron Aquatic Center singing the Puerto Rican national anthem &quot;La Borinqueña&quot;. Vassallo Anadón&#x27;s experiences in the 1979 Games were highlighted in the 1980 documentary &quot;A Step Away&quot;. Also in 1979, he graduated from high school and was placed in the list of the top ten athletes in the world, along with Muhammad Ali, Mario Andretti and others by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine.

Vassallo Anadón was unable to attend the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow, Russia, because of the U.S. and multinational boycott imposed by U.S. President Jimmy Carter as a response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He competed in another competition held in the United States, which were held at the same time as the Moscow Olympics. Vassallo made better times in the 200- and 400-meter individual medley event at the competition than the two gold medalists in Moscow.

==Retirement from competition swimming and college years ==
After competing around the world, Vassallo Anadón moved to Miami and enrolled in the University of Miami. In 1981, he was the NCAA champion in the 400-meter individual medley and set school records in the 200-meter individual medley and the 400-meter individual medley. During his stay at University of Miami, Vassallo Anadón was a two-time All-American in 1981 and 1982, was selected for the Pan American team, as well as the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, which did not compete in Moscow. A June 1982 knee injury to his left knee ligaments that required surgery, however, practically ended his swimming career. He made a successful comeback a year later, and was named to the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he finished fourth in the finals of the 400-meter individual medley, and also competed in the 200-meter backstroke.

He graduated from the University of Miami in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications. That same year he returned to Puerto Rico where he met his future wife, Betsy Lopez, sister of the Atlanta Braves baseball star Javy López and of Puerto Rican volleyball superstar Elaine Lopez. After working in his family business in Ponce for three years, Vassallo and his brothers opened &quot;Vassallo Unlimited&quot; which produces solid surface materials that are used in the construction industry.

Vassallo was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.

Vassalo did some coaching after his competitive years and was the coach of the Pompano Piranhas Swim Club in 2020.

== Honors and legacy ==
In 1997, Vassallo Anadón became the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Among other honors which have been bestowed upon him are his induction into the Japanese Swimmers Hall of Fame; the University of Miami&#x27;s Hall of Fame; the Puerto Rican Hall of Fame and the Ponce Hall of Fame. Vassallo has also appeared on the covers of &quot;&quot;The Olympian&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot;&quot; among others. He is also recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Park for the Illustrious Ponce Citizens. As of June 2011, Vassallo is Head Coach for the Pompano Beach Piranhas in Pompano Beach, Florida. Not surprisingly, after his World Records, he was Swimming World Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Male Swimmer of the Year&quot; in 1978.

In Japan, the swimming style developed by Vassallo is called , based on a mispronunciation (&quot;va-sa-ro&quot;) of Vassallo&#x27;s name.

In an interview for the Olympics Channel in 2018, Vassallo claims to have been a pioneer in the use of underwater dolphin kicks in backstroke events in 1976 when he was only 14 years old. The extensive use of this technique in the following decade completely transformed the sport.

<text>Wei (), known in historiography as the Eastern Wei (), was an imperial dynasty of China that followed the disintegration of the Northern Wei dynasty. One of the Northern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Eastern Wei ruled the eastern part of northern China from 534 to 550. As with the Northern Wei, the ruling family of the Eastern Wei were members of the Tuoba clan of the Xianbei.

==History==
Gao Huan was the potentate of the eastern half of what was Northern Wei territory. In 534, following the disintegration of the Northern Wei dynasty, he installed Yuan Shanjian as ruler of Eastern Wei. Yuan Shanjian was a descendant of the Northern Wei. Yuan Shanjian was a puppet ruler, as the real power lay in the hands of Gao Huan. Several military campaigns, such as the Battle of Shayuan, were launched against the neighboring Western Wei in an attempt to reunify the territory once held by the Northern Wei, however these campaigns were not successful. In 547 Gao Huan died. His sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang were able to pursue his policy of controlling the emperor, but in 550 Gao Yang deposed Yuan Shanjian and founded his own dynasty, the Northern Qi.

==Art==
The Buddhist art of the Eastern Wei displays a combination of Greco-Buddhist influences from Gandhara and Central Asia (representations of flying figures holding wreaths, Greek-style folds of the drapery), together with Chinese artistic influences.

<text>Franchinus Gaffurius (Franchino Gaffurio; 14 January 1451 – 25 June 1522) was an Italian music theorist and composer of the Renaissance.

== Life ==
He was born in Lodi to an aristocratic family. Early in life he entered a Benedictine monastery, where he acquired his early musical training; later he became a priest. Later he lived in Mantua and Verona before settling in Milan as the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the cathedral there, a position which he accepted in January 1484.
During the previous decade the Sforza family, using the composer Gaspar van Weerbeke as a recruiter, had built the choir at their chapel in Milan into one of the largest and most distinguished musical ensembles in Europe: composer-singers such as Alexander Agricola, Loyset Compère and Johannes Martini had all been employed there. While the membership of the choir at the Milan cathedral was mostly Italian, the cross-influence between his choir and the group at the Sforza chapel was significant. Gaffurius retained the post at the cathedral for the rest of his life, and it was in Milan that he knew both Josquin des Prez and Leonardo da Vinci.

== Writings ==
Gaffurius was widely read, and showed a strong Renaissance humanist bent. In addition to having a thorough understanding of contemporary musical practice, he met composers from all over Europe, since he had the good fortune to be living and working at one of the centers of activity for the incoming Netherlanders. His books have a pedagogical intent, and provide a young composer with all the techniques necessary to learn his art.

The major treatises of his years in Milan are three: &quot;Theorica musicae&quot; (1492), &quot;Practica musicae&quot; (1496), and &quot;De harmonia musicorum instrumentorum opus&quot; (1518). The second of these, the &quot;Practica musicae&quot;, is the most thorough, proceeding through subjects as diverse as ancient Greek notation, plainchant, mensuration, counterpoint, and tempo. One of his most famous comments is that the &quot;tactus&quot;, the tempo of a semibreve, is equal to the pulse of a man who is breathing quietly—presumably about 72 beats per minute.

== Music ==

Gaffurius wrote masses, motets, settings of the Magnificat, and hymns, mainly during his Milan years. Some of the motets were written for ceremonial occasions for his ducal employer; many of the masses show the influence of Josquin, and all are in flowing Netherlandish polyphony, though with an admixture of Italian lightness and melody. His music was collected in four codices under his own direction.

<doc id="1189907" wikidata="Q4468440" url="?curid=1189907" title="White Mountain Peak">
<text>White Mountain Peak (or simply White Mountain), at , is the highest peak in the White Mountains of California, the highest peak in Mono County, and the third highest peak in the state after Mount Whitney and Mount Williamson. In spite of its name, the summit block of the peak has large swaths of very dark and colorful orange scree and rock; it is composed of Mesozoic metavolcanic rock, which is igneous rock altered by rising granite.

It is the fourteenth most topographically prominent peak in the contiguous United States. White Mountain Peak is one of only two fourteeners (peaks above 14,000 feet) in California that are not in the Sierra Nevada, the other being Mount Shasta at the far northern end of the state in the Cascade Range. It is the only fourteener in the contiguous United States that is not in the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, or the Sierra Nevada. It is in the Inyo-White Mountains.

==Research Station==
The University of California operates the White Mountain Research Center, comprising three high altitude research stations, on the mountain: Crooked Creek Station at , Barcroft Station at , and a small hut at the summit. The effects of altitude on physiology are studied at the Barcroft Station and summit hut.

==Climbing==

There is a winding dirt road leading to the summit station that is usually cleared of snow between late June and September. Access is restricted to hikers only by a locked gate about 2 miles before Barcroft Station, but White Mountain Research Station usually opens this locked gate at once each year. Open gate days are typically held on a Sunday in the summer season.

The round-trip hike from the gate to the summit is about with less than of vertical gain. However, there are two different dips in the trail of about 250 feet each, adding up to a total elevation gain during the roundtrip of over 3500 feet. The open gate shaves about and of gain off the round trip. This route is popular with mountain bikers.

While the peak is arguably California&#x27;s easiest fourteener via the jeep road, it features more strenuous climbs such as its western ridge, an climb out of Owens Valley via a steep ridge from the end of a rough road. Another route from the East, up Wyman Canyon from the Deep Springs Valley, has a lot of water sources in the first 12 miles. It climbs 7,100 feet to the summit. The peak is rarely approached from the north where it is guarded by a narrow arête or knife-edge ridge. A better nontechnical alternative to the jeep road would be to drive as far as possible up Leidy Canyon from Fish Lake Valley, then take a graded cattle trail up the broad ridge to Perry Aiken Flat.

From the flats it is an easy traverse south into the cirque of the North Fork, North Branch of Perry Aiken Creek. A moderate scramble up the ridge between the North Branch and the larger cirque of the main North Fork leads to the easier upper slopes of the peak. While the peak does not require technical climbing skills, it still poses a serious challenge to hikers because of the high altitude.

==Climate==
The summit and the weather station at has an alpine tundra climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;ET&quot;). Winters are extremely severe, with the peak receiving upwards of of snow annually.

<text>The 1931 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 24th term. It resulted in the newly formed coalition between the United Party and the Reform Party remaining in office as the United–Reform Coalition Government, although the opposition Labour Party made some minor gains despite tallying more votes than any other single party.

==Background==
In the 1928 election, the Reform Party won 28 seats to the United Party&#x27;s 27 seats. Shortly after the election the Reform Party lost a vote of no-confidence and the United Party managed to form a government, the United Government, with the support of the Labour Party, with governing Reform Party going into the opposition. In 1931, however, the agreement between United and Labour collapsed due to differing opinions on how to counter the Great Depression. The Reform Party, fearing that the Depression would give Labour a substantial boost, reluctantly agreed to form a coalition with United to avert elections. By forming a coalition, United and Reform were able to blunt Labour&#x27;s advantage, ending the possibility of the anti-Labour vote being split.

==The election==
The date for the main 1931 elections was 2 December, a Wednesday. Elections to the four Māori electorates were held the day before. 874,787 people were registered to vote, and there was a turnout of 83.3%. This turnout was below average for the time period.

The number of seats was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902. However, in four electorates (Bay of Plenty, Oroua, Pahiatua, ) there was only one candidate.

==Results==
The 1931 election saw the recently formed governing coalition retain office as the United–Reform Coalition, winning fifty-one seats, including four independents. This was a drop of four seats from what the two parties had won in the previous elections, but was still considerably better than many had expected given the economic situation. The Labour Party won twenty-four seats, a gain of five. In the popular vote (including pro-coalition independents), the coalition won 54.0% of the vote, down from the 66.1% that the two parties had won previously. Labour won 34.3%. The only other party to gain a place in Parliament was the Country Party, which won a single seat. Four other independents were elected. Four candidates were elected unopposed: Walter Broadfoot in , John Cobbe in , Alfred Ransom in , and Kenneth Williams in .

<text>KKKill the Fetus is the third studio album by Esham. Released in 1993, the album&#x27;s lyrics focus on subjects such as abortion and murder. The album, which has been cited as an iconic horrorcore album, has been praised for its genre-defining production and lyrics. It is considered to be Esham&#x27;s critical breakthrough, compared to lackluster reviews of his previous albums. The single &quot;Sunshine&quot; received very heavy radio play nationally. The music video for &quot;Hellterskkkelter&quot; was featured on an episode of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; in 1994, and was given out at an autograph signing at Rock of Ages in rare VHS form during the promotional launch.

The album&#x27;s title track encourages drug-addicted pregnant women to have an abortion rather than give birth to their children to be raised improperly. The album&#x27;s cover depicts a fetus simulating fellatio and thus would be born not only a dope fiend, but also a sex fiend which is why abortion is stressed in the album&#x27;s title track. Many of the songs are short and heavily sample-based.

==Reception==

In his review of the album, Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;At this point in his career, his rapping has already reached near-peak levels, and his production shows a continued path towards an inventiveness. [...] Never again would Esham be so gritty.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Fangoria&quot; named it as an iconic horrorcore album.

<text>Samuel Clarke &quot;Sandy&quot; Pearlman (August 5, 1943 – July 26, 2016) was an American music producer, artist manager, music journalist and critic, professor, poet, songwriter, and record company executive. He was best known for founding, writing for, producing, or co-producing many LPs by Blue Öyster Cult, as well as producing notable albums by The Clash, The Dictators, Pavlov&#x27;s Dog, and Dream Syndicate; he was also the founding Vice President of eMusic.com. He was the Schulich Distinguished Professor Chair at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University in Montreal, and from August 2014 held a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship at the Coach House Institute (CHI) of the University of Toronto Faculty of Information as part of the CHI&#x27;s McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology.

== Early life and education ==
Pearlman was born in the Rockaway neighborhood of Queens, New York, the son of pharmacy operator Hyman Pearlman. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Stony Brook University in 1966, where he had been student president. He was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in the History of Ideas, and completed graduate work at Brandeis University. He was also a New School Fellow in sociology and anthropology. As a university student, Pearlman wrote a series of poems called &quot;Imaginos&quot;, whose characters and lyrics would feature in his later career.

== Career ==
In 1967, Pearlman hand-picked musicians for a rock band to perform the lyrics that he was writing, based on his &quot;Imaginos&quot; poems. He dubbed the band &quot;Soft White Underbelly&quot; (from a World War II speech by Winston Churchill) and later changed their name to &quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot;. He managed the band (with Murray Krugman) from 1967 to 1995, and produced or co-produced 7 of their studio albums, and 4 of their live albums. Significantly, Pearlman was co-producer, with David Lucas and Murray Krugman, of BÖC&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; in 1976. The song reached No. 12 on the Top 40 charts and has remained an FM radio staple since. On the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of top 500 songs of all time, it is listed as No. 405.

In 1966, he was introduced to the founder of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; magazine, Paul Williams, by Playboy political analyst Michael Horowitz; by 1967 Pearlman had become one of the original rock music critics of the magazine along with Williams, Jon Landau and Richard Meltzer, with Horowitz later penning a cover profile of Jim Morrison for &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; in April 1969.

Pearlman was considered an important figure in the development of both alternative and commercial American rock music, and for his intervention in British punk. He was drafted by record company CBS to produce &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot;, The Clash&#x27;s second album, which gave the band their largest audience to date, and also produced many of the tracks that were compiled in &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;. He was described as the &quot;Hunter Thompson of rock, a gonzo producer of searing intellect and vast vision.&quot;, in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Producer Directory.

Pearlman also worked as a full-time artist manager, managing the careers of Blue Öyster Cult, Black Sabbath (1979–1983), Romeo Void, The Dictators, Shakin&#x27; Street, Aldo Nova and others. In the 1980s, he pioneered the mega-tour stadium format of several bands traveling together, sharing promotional costs and production and travel costs, a format persisting today with the Lollapalooza Festival, the Lilith Fair and related tour packages.

In 1983, Pearlman leased Studio C in San Francisco&#x27;s The Automatt Studios from studio owner David Rubinson and dubbed it Time Enough World Enough Studios. After The Automatt closed in 1984, he leased Studio C at Hyde Street Studios from studio owner Dan Alexander. Pearlman ran a recording operation in Studio C as Alpha &amp; Omega Studio from 1986 until 1991. He also used it for his own projects, including those on his short-lived MCA-distributed label Popular Metaphysics, and he also sub-leased it to other producers and artists.

In 1989 he took over as president of the alternative record company 415 Records and established a production and distribution deal for the label with MCA Records, before purchasing the company and changing the label&#x27;s name to Popular Metaphysics.

The label was short lived, but it signed a few solid acts and released their records on the MCA label, including Love Club (1990), Manitoba&#x27;s Wild Kingdom (1990), and World Entertainment War (1991). The 1991 edition of Mark Garvey&#x27;s &quot;Songwriters&#x27; Market&quot;, published in 1990, carried a listing that read as follows: &quot;*SANDY PEARLMAN, INC., 245 Hyde St., San Francisco CA 94102. (415)885-4999. A&amp;R Director: Natasha V. Record producer, record company (Popular Metaphysics, formerly 415), recording studio (Alpha &amp; Omega Recording, Hyde Street Studios).&quot;

In the late 1990s, Pearlman served as the founding vice-president of e-music.com, a subscription store for download-to-own online music and audiobooks that is headquartered in New York City and now owned by Dimensional Associates. eMusic was one of the first sites to sell music in the MP3 format, beginning in 1998. As of September 2008, eMusic had over 400,000 subscribers. He also served as vice-president of media development for MoodLogic.com, the first on-line music recommendation engine, from 2000 to 2003.

In 2009, Sandy Pearlman was appointed as an at-large member of the National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) of the Library of Congress.

Pearlman was the Schulich Distinguished Chair of music at McGill University in Montreal, specializing in the programs in music theory, sound recording and music technology; he later served as Centenary Fellow at the McLuhan Center for Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto, where he co-taught a course on Digital Media Distribution. Additionally, he was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University, Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Cruz, and an invited speaker at the Mill Valley Film Festival, Future of Music Coalition, Canadian Music Week and SxSW Festivals. As a Professor and as a public speaker, Pearlman lectured on the architecture of the music industry, strategies for re-monetizing music downloads, and the history and future of music. He owned Alpha &amp; Omega Recording, a 72-track analog recording facility in San Rafael, California. His production career was managed by Peter Shershin at Breathing Protection, Inc.

===Awards===
Pearlman was the recipient of 17 gold and platinum records.

== Death ==
Pearlman died on July 26, 2016, in Novato, California, from pneumonia due to stroke-related complications. He was 72.

<doc id="1189926" wikidata="Q1952589" url="?curid=1189926" title="Boomin' Words from Hell">
<text>Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell is the debut album by the American musician Esham. It was released in 1989, and reissued the following year.

==Production==
&quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot; was recorded in one day.

==Lyrical themes==
The lyrics of &quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot; developed from the turmoil of Detroit at the time, including the era&#x27;s rise in crack use. According to Esham, &quot;It was all an expression about [&#x27;70s-&#x27;80s drug cartel] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred to the streets of Detroit as &#x27;Hell&#x27; on that record. So that&#x27;s where my ideas came from.&quot;

According to Esham, the album&#x27;s lyrical content was so dark that it was the subject of many rumors:

&quot;People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They&#x27;d get into an accident and be like, &#x27;I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people&#x27;s heads. It wasn&#x27;t to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples&#x27; attention. [...] We said a lot of things that people wanted to say but didn&#x27;t say. We talked about a lot of political and social [issues] that people didn&#x27;t want to talk about.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot; was first issued in 1989. It was promoted via word of mouth. Following the album&#x27;s initial release, the album was reissued with an alternate track listing and artwork in 1990. Word After Word was also censored in the second half of the line, &quot;I&#x27;m not an atheist / But what has god done for me?&quot;. A 25th anniversary reissue of the album, containing songs from the original release as well as the 1990 version, was released on February 13, 2015.

==Reception==

Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to the album because of Smith&#x27;s heavy metal influences. In &quot;All Music Guide to Hip-Hop&quot; Jason Birchmeier writes that &quot;Many of the songs here are fairly mediocre relative to Esham&#x27;s later work, but there are a few gems here that foreshadow his subsequent work.&quot; Rap Reviews reviewer John-Michael Bond wrote that &quot;the fully realized darkness that surrounds both soundtrack and verses on &quot;Boomin Words...&quot; stands as a stark reminder that just because someone&#x27;s a kid doesn&#x27;t mean he can&#x27;t have anything to say.&quot;

<text>Minette Caroline Mary Walters DL (born 26 September 1949) is an English writer.

== Life and work ==
Walters was born in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford in 1949 to Samuel Jebb and Colleen Jebb. As her father was a serving army officer, the first 10 years of Walters&#x27;s life were spent moving between army bases in the north and south of England. Her father died from kidney failure in 1960. While raising Walters and her two brothers, Colleen Jebb painted miniatures from photographs to supplement the family&#x27;s income. Walters spent a year at the Abbey School in Reading, Berkshire, before winning a Foundation Scholarship at the Godolphin boarding school in Salisbury.

During a gap year between school and Durham University, 1968, Walters volunteered in Israel with The Bridge in Britain, working on a kibbutz and in a delinquent boys&#x27; home in Jerusalem. She graduated from Trevelyan College, Durham in 1971 with a BA in French. Minette met her husband Alec Walters while she was at Durham and they married in 1978. They have two sons, Roland and Philip.

Walters joined IPC Magazines as a sub-editor in 1972 and became an editor of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Weekly Library&quot; the following year. She supplemented her salary by writing romantic novelettes, short stories, and serials in her spare time. The romantic novelettes were written in approximately two weeks and published under a pseudonym that remains a secret. Walters turned freelance in 1977 but continued to write for magazines to cover her bills.

Her first full-length novel, &quot;The Ice House&quot;, was published in 1992. It took two and a half years to write and was rejected by numerous publishing houses until Maria Rejt, Macmillan Publishers, bought it for £1250. Within four months, it had won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association John Creasey award for best first novel and had been snapped up by 11 foreign publishers. Walters was the first crime/thriller writer to win three major prizes with her first three books. Walters&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Sculptress,&quot; which was inspired in part by an encounter Walters had as a volunteer prison visitor, won the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award. Walters&#x27;s third novel, &quot;The Scold&#x27;s Bridle&quot;, then won the CWA Gold Dagger, giving her a unique treble.

Walters&#x27;s themes include isolation, family dysfunction, rejection, marginalisation, justice and revenge. Her novels are often set against real backgrounds and real events to draw her readers into the &#x27;reality&#x27; of what she is writing about. With no series character tying her to particular people, places or times, she moves freely around settings – a sink estate (&quot;Acid Row&quot;), a Dorset village (&quot;Fox Evil&quot;), a suburb of London (&quot;The Shape of Snakes&quot;) – although every setting is &#x27;claustrophobic&#x27; to encourage the characters &#x27;to turn on each other&#x27;.

Walters describes herself as an exploratory writer who never uses a plot scheme, begins with simple premises, has no idea &#x27;whodunit&#x27; until halfway through a story, but who remains excited about each novel because she, along with her reader, wants to know what happens next.

As part of the British project &#x27;Quick Reads&#x27;, to encourage literacy amongst adults with reading difficulties, Walters wrote a 20,000-word novella called &quot;Chickenfeed&quot;. In competition with works by other best-selling authors, such as Ruth Rendell, Maeve Binchy and Joanna Trollope, &quot;Chickenfeed&quot; has won two awards as the best novella in the &#x27;Quick Reads&#x27; genre. It has also been translated into several languages.

In September 2007, Walters released her fourteenth book, &quot;The Chameleon&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, in the UK.

On 3–7 March 2008, BBC2 aired &quot;Murder Most Famous&quot;, a five-part TV talent contest series, in which Walters tutors and judges six competing celebrity writers, with the winner having his or her crime fiction novel published by Pan Macmillan on World Book Day 2009.
The contestants were Brendan Cole, Sherrie Hewson, Kelvin MacKenzie, Matt Allwright, Angela Griffin and Diarmuid Gavin. The series was won by the actress Sherrie Hewson, whose debut novel &quot;The Tannery&quot; was published in March 2009.

After a pause of 10 years in which she wrote two novellas, Walters has decided to write historical novels. The first of these novels is &quot;The Last Hours&quot;, set during the Black Death, followed by a sequel, &quot;The Turn of Midnight&quot;.

In 2019 Walters was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset.

<text>Balmaseda (in Basque and officially, in Spanish: &quot;Valmaseda&quot;) is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country. Balmaseda is the capital city of the comarca of Enkarterri, in western Biscay and serves an important role in the province thanks to its proximity to the capital city of Bilbao and the regions of Cantabria and Castile and León.

== Etymology ==

Its toponomy probably comes from a union of the Spanish word &quot;val&quot; (apocope of &quot;valle&quot;), meaning &quot;valley&quot;, and the Basque &quot;mahatseta&quot;, which means &quot;vineyard&quot;, &quot;Val-Mahatseta&quot; would then mean &quot;valley of vineyards&quot;, which would eventually evolve into &quot;Valmaseda&quot;, currently in use in Spanish, and &quot;Balmaseda&quot;, following the orthographic rules of the Basque language.

== History ==

The lands in which Balmaseda is located had been inhabited since centuries before its official foundation, with evidence of ancient pastoral activity. In the eastern end of the municipality there is a Roman milestone which belonged to the &quot;Pisorica&quot;-&quot;Flaviobriga&quot; road, which connected the present-day cities of Castro Urdiales and Herrera de Pisuerga. This road is believed to have been in use at least since the 1st Century, as the milestone is dated 238. Even though the town&#x27;s old bridge could have been built simultaneously, there are not any evidences of its existence until some centuries later.

The territory in which today is located Balmaseda belonged to the valley of Mena, part of the Kingdom of Navarre. The Castilians occupied it in 1175, moment when the king handed over the territory to Lope Sánchez de Mena, Lord of Bortedo and kin of the Lord of Biscay. Lope Sánchez founded then the village, probably on the same location of a previous settlement, in one of the banks of the river Kadagua, granting the village the fuero of Logroño. Among the reasons for the foundation of the village were its protected location between mountains and the existence of a commercial road connecting to Castile and Biscay.

The village was incorporated to the lands of the Lord of Biscay when the Lord Lope Díaz II de Haro married the daughter of Alfonso IX, thus obtaining the territories of Balmaseda and Orduña. In 1234, Lope confirmed the municipal charter establishing Balmaseda as a town. However, this first union with Biscay would not last much; in 1255 the town was converted back to Castile because of the disputes caused by Diego López III de Haro. In 1274 it was given back to Biscay to be once more handed back to Castile in 1288 after the murder of Lope Díaz III in Alfaro following the orders of Sancho IV. Diego López IV would once more reinstate Balmaseda into Biscay. In 1312, after the disputes between Biscay and Castile, Balmaseda was once more reintegrated into the kingdom. The town would be incorporated again in Biscay in 1388, as it was requested by the village itself.

During the Middle Ages, Balmaseda was home to a Jewish community until their voluntary departure in 1487.

On 5 November 1808 the city was the theatre of the Battle of Valmaseda, part of the Peninsular War, between French and Spanish armies.

In May 2016, the return of Valmaseda to the Las Encartaciones Commonwealth, from which it had left in 2001, was agreed. The inclusion was carried out with the votes in favor of PNV, Avant Gordexola and Agrupación Electoral Independiente, three abstentions by EH Bildu and the vote against by Zalla Bai and Karrantza Zabala. The Carranza government team presented a judicial appeal on behalf of the municipal group, on the contrary, the mayor of Zalla, Javier Portillo Berasaluze, presented the judicial appeal against membership on behalf of the Zalla City Council.

== Geography ==


The municipality of Balmaseda is located in very mountainous territory, in southwestern Biscay and 30 kilometers away from the province capital city Bilbao. Balmaseda is located in the comarca of Enkarterri and it borders Artzentales, in the west, with Sopuerta in the north and Zalla in the east. In the south Balmaseda borders with the autonomous community of Castile and León (province of Burgos). It is surrounded by the Ordunte mountains; Kolitza, Canto, Terreros and La Garbea.

Nature park of Valley of Karrantza with Pozalagua Cave situated not far (and accessible by public buses and taxi) from Balmaseda.

=== Hydrography ===

The main river of the municipality is the river Kadagua, which forms the narrow valley where the town is located. The river is joined by several minor streams as the Acebo, Coliza, Tueros and Angostura. The river Kadagua has had historical importance for the town and still today has an important symbolism, as it is present on the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

== Social sphere ==

Amongst city&#x27;s landmarks are Puente Viejo Roman Bridge (XIII), Ayuntmiento-Town Hall, Cathedral Iglesia de San Severino (XIV), Church of Sagrado Corazón (Klaret Antzokia), Iglesia San Juan, Iglesia de Santa Clara with museum, Palacio Horcasitas, Balmaseda historical museum, La Encartada beret factory museum, modern court of justice.

Balmaseda carries Medieval market in March and San Severino festival on 23 October.

Balmaseda has Sociedad Deportiva Balmaseda Fútbol Club (since 1914) with home La Baluga camp stadium.

== Transport ==

Balmaseda is connected with the rest of the province of Enkarterri region and the capital city of Bilbao by the BI-636 road and by the narrow-gauge railway Feve and by bus (Bizkaibus-route number A0651).

== Personalities ==

Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza (1578–1641), an important Jesuit author of theological and philosophical textbooks.

<doc id="1189936" wikidata="Q3775843" url="?curid=1189936" title="French maid">
<text>French maid was a term applied in the Victorian and early 20th-century periods to a lady&#x27;s maid of French nationality. A lady&#x27;s maid was a senior servant who reported directly to the lady of the house, and accompanied her mistress on travel. She helped her mistress with her appearance, including make-up, hairdressing, clothing, jewellery, and shoes, and sometimes served as confidante. A French maid was considered likely to be more expert in current fashions, and was also able to apply her knowledge of the French language when travelling in Europe.

==Later history==
Erotic fantasies revolving around young French women later led to the appearance of French maids as desirable and stereotypical soubrette characters in burlesque dramas and bedroom farces. This stock character was a flirtatious, cheeky, and saucy figure.

The term &quot;French maid&quot; is now often applied to an eroticised and strongly modified style of servant&#x27;s dress that evolved from typical housemaid&#x27;s black-and-white afternoon uniforms of 19th-century France, despite a housemaid being junior to a lady&#x27;s maid. Some styles are conservative while others are revealing. The French maid costume is often used in cosplay, sexual roleplaying, and uniform fetishism. Depending on design details, some forms can be classified as lingerie.

In the anime and manga fandom, and especially among , maid outfits are considered to be . In the 21st century, restaurants known as &quot;maid cafés&quot; have been opened in Japan and other countries to appeal to the aforementioned &quot;moe&quot; aesthetic.

===Costume details===

Though not strict to historically accurate uniforms, the French maid outfit has an easily recognizable pattern and black-and white theme that remains the template for other forms of the costume.

The typical French maid costume includes:
* A black dress with white trim, with a full skirt at or above knee length
* White half-apron, usually with ruffle or lace
* A ruffled or lace headpiece or a bonnet
* Tights or stockings
* High heels, usually black
* A feather duster
* White or black lace garter

Optional accessories depend on design and context:
* Choker necklace
* Other cleaning equipment

<doc id="1189937" wikidata="Q1992074" url="?curid=1189937" title="Bit array">
<text>A bit array (also known as bitmask, bit map, bit set, bit string, or bit vector) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits. It can be used to implement a simple set data structure. A bit array is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly. A typical bit array stores &quot;kw&quot; bits, where &quot;w&quot; is the number of bits in the unit of storage, such as a byte or word, and &quot;k&quot; is some nonnegative integer. If &quot;w&quot; does not divide the number of bits to be stored, some space is wasted due to internal fragmentation.

== Definition ==
A bit array is a mapping from some domain (almost always a range of integers) to values in the set {0, 1}. The values can be interpreted as dark/light, absent/present, locked/unlocked, valid/invalid, et cetera. The point is that there are only two possible values, so they can be stored in one bit. As with other arrays, the access to a single bit can be managed by applying an index to the array. Assuming its size (or length) to be &quot;n&quot; bits, the array can be used to specify a subset of the domain (e.g. {0, 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;−1}), where a 1-bit indicates the presence and a 0-bit the absence of a number in the set. This set data structure uses about &quot;n&quot;/&quot;w&quot; words of space, where &quot;w&quot; is the number of bits in each machine word. Whether the least significant bit (of the word) or the most significant bit indicates the smallest-index number is largely irrelevant, but the former tends to be preferred (on little-endian machines).

A finite binary relation may be represented by a bit array called a logical matrix. In the calculus of relations, these arrays are composed with matrix multiplication where the arithmetic is Boolean, and such a composition represents composition of relations.

== Basic operations ==
Although most machines are not able to address individual bits in memory, nor have instructions to manipulate single bits, each bit in a word can be singled out and manipulated using bitwise operations. In particular:

Use codice_1 to set a bit to one:
 11101010 
 OR 00000100 
 = 11101110
codice_2 to set a bit to zero:
 11101010
 AND 11111101
 = 11101000
codice_2 to determine if a bit is set, by zero-testing:
 11101010 11101010
 AND 00000001 AND 00000010
 = 00000000 = 00000010
 (=0 ∴ bit isn&#x27;t set) (≠0 ∴ bit is set)

codice_4 to invert or toggle a bit:
 11101010 11101110
 XOR 00000100 XOR 00000100
 = 11101110 = 11101010

codice_5 to invert all bits:
 NOT 10110010 
 = 01001101

To obtain the bit mask needed for these operations, we can use a bit shift operator to shift the number 1 to the left by the appropriate number of places, as well as bitwise negation if necessary.

Given two bit arrays of the same size representing sets, we can compute their union, intersection, and set-theoretic difference using &quot;n&quot;/&quot;w&quot; simple bit operations each (2&quot;n&quot;/&quot;w&quot; for difference), as well as the complement of either:

 for i from 0 to n/w-1
 complement_a[i] := not a[i]
 union[i] := a[i] or b[i]
 intersection[i] := a[i] and b[i]
 difference[i] := a[i] and (not b[i])

If we wish to iterate through the bits of a bit array, we can do this efficiently using a doubly nested loop that loops through each word, one at a time. Only &quot;n&quot;/&quot;w&quot; memory accesses are required:

 for i from 0 to n/w-1
 index := 0 // if needed
 word := a[i]
 for b from 0 to w-1
 value := word and 1 ≠ 0
 word := word shift right 1
 // do something with value
 index := index + 1 // if needed

Both of these code samples exhibit ideal locality of reference, which will subsequently receive large performance boost from a data cache. If a cache line is &quot;k&quot; words, only about &quot;n&quot;/&quot;wk&quot; cache misses will occur.

== More complex operations ==

As with character strings it is straightforward to define &quot;length&quot;, &quot;substring&quot;, lexicographical &quot;compare&quot;, &quot;concatenation&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot; operations. The implementation of some of these operations is sensitive to endianness.

=== Population / Hamming weight ===
If we wish to find the number of 1 bits in a bit array, sometimes called the population count or Hamming weight, there are efficient branch-free algorithms that can compute the number of bits in a word using a series of simple bit operations. We simply run such an algorithm on each word and keep a running total. Counting zeros is similar. See the Hamming weight article for examples of an efficient implementation.

=== Inversion ===

Vertical flipping of a one-bit-per-pixel image, or some FFT algorithms, requires flipping the bits of individual words (so codice_6 becomes codice_7).
When this operation is not available on the processor, it&#x27;s still possible to proceed by successive passes, in this example on 32 bits:
exchange two 16-bit halfwords
exchange bytes by pairs (0xddccbbaa -&gt; 0xccddaabb)
swap bits by pairs
swap bits (b31 b30 ... b1 b0 -&gt; b30 b31 ... b0 b1)

The last operation can be written ((x&amp;0x55555555) « 1) | (x&amp;0xaaaaaaaa) » 1)).
=== Find first one ===
The find first set or &quot;find first one&quot; operation identifies the index or position of the 1-bit with the smallest index in an array, and has widespread hardware support (for arrays not larger than a word) and efficient algorithms for its computation. When a priority queue is stored in a bit array, find first one can be used to identify the highest priority element in the queue. To expand a word-size &quot;find first one&quot; to longer arrays, one can find the first nonzero word and then run &quot;find first one&quot; on that word. The related operations &quot;find first zero&quot;, &quot;count leading zeros&quot;, &quot;count leading ones&quot;, &quot;count trailing zeros&quot;, &quot;count trailing ones&quot;, and &quot;log base 2&quot; (see find first set) can also be extended to a bit array in a straightforward manner.

== Compression ==

A bit array is the most dense storage for &quot;random&quot; bits, that is, where each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1, and each one is independent. But most data are not random, so it may be possible to store it more compactly. For example, the data of a typical fax image is not random and can be compressed. Run-length encoding is commonly used to compress these long streams. However, most compressed data formats are not so easy to access randomly; also by compressing bit arrays too aggressively we run the risk of losing the benefits due to bit-level parallelism (vectorization). Thus, instead of compressing bit arrays as streams of bits, we might compress them as streams of bytes or words (see Bitmap index (compression)).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Bit arrays, despite their simplicity, have a number of marked advantages over other data structures for the same problems:
* They are extremely compact; no other data structures can store &quot;n&quot; independent pieces of data in &quot;n&quot;/&quot;w&quot; words.
* They allow small arrays of bits to be stored and manipulated in the register set for long periods of time with no memory accesses.
* Because of their ability to exploit bit-level parallelism, limit memory access, and maximally use the data cache, they often outperform many other data structures on practical data sets, even those that are more asymptotically efficient.
However, bit arrays are not the solution to everything. In particular:
* Without compression, they are wasteful set data structures for sparse sets (those with few elements compared to their range) in both time and space. For such applications, compressed bit arrays, Judy arrays, tries, or even Bloom filters should be considered instead.
* Accessing individual elements can be expensive and difficult to express in some languages. If random access is more common than sequential and the array is relatively small, a byte array may be preferable on a machine with byte addressing. A word array, however, is probably not justified due to the huge space overhead and additional cache misses it causes, unless the machine only has word addressing.

== Applications ==
Because of their compactness, bit arrays have a number of applications in areas where space or efficiency is at a premium. Most commonly, they are used to represent a simple group of Boolean flags or an ordered sequence of Boolean values.

Bit arrays are used for priority queues, where the bit at index &quot;k&quot; is set if and only if &quot;k&quot; is in the queue; this data structure is used, for example, by the Linux kernel, and benefits strongly from a find-first-zero operation in hardware.

Bit arrays can be used for the allocation of memory pages, inodes, disk sectors, etc. In such cases, the term &quot;bitmap&quot; may be used. However, this term is frequently used to refer to raster images, which may use multiple bits per pixel.

Another application of bit arrays is the Bloom filter, a probabilistic set data structure that can store large sets in a small space in exchange for a small probability of error. It is also possible to build probabilistic hash tables based on bit arrays that accept either false positives or false negatives.

Bit arrays and the operations on them are also important for constructing succinct data structures, which use close to the minimum possible space. In this context, operations like finding the &quot;n&quot;th 1 bit or counting the number of 1 bits up to a certain position become important.

Bit arrays are also a useful abstraction for examining streams of compressed data, which often contain elements that occupy portions of bytes or are not byte-aligned. For example, the compressed Huffman coding representation of a single 8-bit character can be anywhere from 1 to 255 bits long.

In information retrieval, bit arrays are a good representation for the posting lists of very frequent terms. If we compute the gaps between adjacent values in a list of strictly increasing integers and encode them using unary coding, the result is a bit array with a 1 bit in the &quot;n&quot;th position if and only if &quot;n&quot; is in the list. The implied probability of a gap of &quot;n&quot; is 1/2&quot;n&quot;. This is also the special case of Golomb coding where the parameter M is 1; this parameter is only normally selected when , or roughly the term occurs in at least 38% of documents.

== Language support ==
The APL programming language fully supports bit arrays of arbitrary shape and size as a Boolean datatype distinct from integers. All major implementations (Dyalog APL, APL2, APL Next, NARS2000, Gnu APL, etc.) pack the bits densely into whatever size the machine word is. Bits may be accessed individually via the usual indexing notation (A[3]) as well as through all of the usual primitive functions and operators where they are often operated on using a special case algorithm such as summing the bits via a table lookup of bytes.

The C programming language&#x27;s &quot;bit fields&quot;, pseudo-objects found in structs with size equal to some number of bits, are in fact small bit arrays; they are limited in that they cannot span words. Although they give a convenient syntax, the bits are still accessed using bytewise operators on most machines, and they can only be defined statically (like C&#x27;s static arrays, their sizes are fixed at compile-time). It is also a common idiom for C programmers to use words as small bit arrays and access bits of them using bit operators. A widely available header file included in the X11 system, xtrapbits.h, is “a portable way for systems to define bit field manipulation of arrays of bits.” A more explanatory description of aforementioned approach can be found in the comp.lang.c faq.

In C++, although individual codice_8s typically occupy the same space as a byte or an integer, the STL type codice_9 is a partial template specialization in which bits are packed as a space efficiency optimization. Since bytes (and not bits) are the smallest addressable unit in C++, the [] operator does &quot;not&quot; return a reference to an element, but instead returns a proxy reference. This might seem a minor point, but it means that codice_9 is &quot;not&quot; a standard STL container, which is why the use of codice_9 is generally discouraged. Another unique STL class, codice_12, creates a vector of bits fixed at a particular size at compile-time, and in its interface and syntax more resembles the idiomatic use of words as bit sets by C programmers. It also has some additional power, such as the ability to efficiently count the number of bits that are set. The Boost C++ Libraries provide a codice_13 class whose size is specified at run-time.

The D programming language provides bit arrays in its standard library, Phobos, in codice_14. As in C++, the [] operator does not return a reference, since individual bits are not directly addressable on most hardware, but instead returns a codice_8.

In Java, the class creates a bit array that is then manipulated with functions named after bitwise operators familiar to C programmers. Unlike the codice_12 in C++, the Java codice_17 does not have a &quot;size&quot; state (it has an effectively infinite size, initialized with 0 bits); a bit can be set or tested at any index. In addition, there is a class , which represents a Set of values of an enumerated type internally as a bit vector, as a safer alternative to bit fields.

The .NET Framework supplies a codice_18 collection class. It stores bits using an array of type codice_19 (each element in the array usually represents 32 bits). The class supports random access and bitwise operators, can be iterated over, and its codice_20 property can be changed to grow or truncate it.

Although Standard ML has no support for bit arrays, Standard ML of New Jersey has an extension, the codice_18 structure, in its SML/NJ Library. It is not fixed in size and supports set operations and bit operations, including, unusually, shift operations.

Haskell likewise currently lacks standard support for bitwise operations, but both GHC and Hugs provide a codice_22 module with assorted bitwise functions and operators, including shift and rotate operations and an &quot;unboxed&quot; array over Boolean values may be used to model a Bit array, although this lacks support from the former module.

In Perl, strings can be used as expandable bit arrays. They can be manipulated using the usual bitwise operators (codice_23), and individual bits can be tested and set using the &quot;vec&quot; function.

In Ruby, you can access (but not set) a bit of an integer (codice_24 or codice_25) using the bracket operator (codice_26), as if it were an array of bits.

Apple&#x27;s Core Foundation library contains CFBitVector and CFMutableBitVector structures.

PL/I supports arrays of &quot;bit strings&quot; of arbitrary length, which may be either fixed-length or varying. The array elements may be &quot;aligned&quot;— each element begins on a byte or word boundary— or &quot;unaligned&quot;— elements immediately follow each other with no padding.

PL/pgSQL and PostgreSQL&#x27;s SQL support &quot;bit strings&quot; as native type. There are two SQL bit types: codice_27&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; and codice_28&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, where &quot;codice_29&quot; is a positive integer.

Hardware description languages such as VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog natively support bit vectors as these are used to model storage elements like flip-flops, hardware busses and hardware signals in general. In hardware verification languages such as OpenVera, &quot;e&quot; and SystemVerilog, bit vectors are used to sample values from the hardware models, and to represent data that is transferred to hardware during simulations.

Common Lisp provides a one-dimensional codice_30 implementation as a special case of the built-in codice_31, acting in a dual capacity as a class and a type specifier. Being a derivative of the array, it relies on the general codice_32 function to be configured with an element type of codice_33, which optionally permits the bit vector to be designated as dynamically resizable. The codice_30, however, is not infinite in extent. A more restricted codice_35 type exists, which explicitly excludes the dynamic characteristics. Bit vectors are represented as, and can be constructed in a more concise fashion by, the &quot;reader macro&quot; codice_36. In addition to the general functions applicable to all arrays, dedicated operations exist for bit vectors. Single bits may be accessed and modified using the codice_33 and codice_38 functions and an extensive number of logical operations is supported.

<text>The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show (known as You&#x27;re on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown during reruns on Nickelodeon) is an American animated television series featuring characters and storylines from the Charles M. Schulz comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; as first presented for television in the Peanuts animated specials. It aired Saturday mornings on the CBS network from 1983 to 1985.

Due to lower-than-expected ratings, in an attempt to boost viewership, CBS moved the series to 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time early in 1984. It did not help the ratings much, and while the show was not formally cancelled in 1984, further production was on hiatus, and in 1985, CBS ordered five new episodes for what would be a second and final season. Early in 1986, CBS dropped the show after a ratings recession.

&quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot; is one of the few television series produced by Bill Melendez, whose animation studio generally produced specials. The show reaired on The Disney Channel in 1993 and was aired on YTV in Canada by 1996. It also aired on the CBBC block on BBC One and BBC Two from 1986 to 2005.

== Cast ==
Typical for an animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; production, the characters were performed by real children, and there was a large cast turnover between the first and second season due to many of the child actors maturing out of their roles, leaving only Jeremy Schoenberg, Jason Muller and Bill Melendez to remain.

==Episodes==

===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1983)===
===Season 2 (1985)===
== Theme song ==
The first season&#x27;s theme was a Vince Guaraldi styled piano-based instrumental written and produced for this series, which was composed by Desiree Goyette and Ed Bogas. The song was given lyrics and released in 1984 as &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party with Charlie Brown and Snoopy&quot; on the album &quot;Flashbeagle&quot;, the soundtrack to the special &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot;. On the second season, a shortened version with the lyrics that appeared on the &quot;Flashbeagle&quot; album was used.

==Home media==
In 1987, Kartes Video Communications released the show on VHS in 9 volumes (with titles in the style of normal &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials), with two episodes each. From 1994 to 2001, Paramount Home Video released the show on VHS and LaserDisc in the same fashion, but under the actual title of the show. On June 14, 2011, Warner Home Video released the 14th episode of the show on DVD under a single disc called: &quot;Happiness Is... Peanuts: Snoopy&#x27;s Adventures&quot;. They also announced that on October 18, 2011, the eighteenth and final episode of the show would come to DVD under a single disc called: &quot;Happiness Is... Peanuts: Snow Days&quot;, the thirteenth episode of the show came to DVD under a single disc called: &quot;Happiness Is... Peanuts: Friends Forever&quot; on December 27, 2011, and the fifteenth episode of the show came to DVD under a single disc called: &quot;Happiness Is... Peanuts: Team Snoopy&quot; on May 1, 2012. On October 9, 2012, &quot;Happiness Is... Peanuts: Go Snoopy Go!&quot; featured the twelfth episode of the show. Also, the entire series is available through iTunes. On January 21, 2014, the first, fourth and eleventh episodes appeared on a single disc DVD called &quot;Touchdown Charlie Brown.&quot; On November 20, 2012, Warner Bros. released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection. Nine episodes are on each of the two-disc set. All episodes have previously been released on DVD in Australia and Germany across two 2-disc box sets.

<doc id="1189944" wikidata="Q681886" url="?curid=1189944" title="Low-frequency oscillation">
<text>Low-frequency oscillation (LFO) is an electronic frequency that is usually below 20 Hz and creates a rhythmic pulse or sweep. This is used to modulate musical equipment such as synthesizers to create audio effects such as vibrato, tremolo and phasing.

==History==
Low-frequency oscillation was introduced with modular synthesizers of the 1960s, such as the Moog synthesizer. Often the LFO effect was accidental, as there were myriad configurations that could be &quot;patched&quot; by the synth operator. LFOs have since appeared in some form on almost every synthesizer. More recently other electronic musical instruments, such as samplers and software synthesizers, have included LFOs to increase their sound alteration capabilities.

==Overview==
The primary oscillator circuits of a synthesizer are used to create the audio signals. An LFO is a secondary oscillator that operates at a significantly lower frequency than other oscillators, typically below 20 Hz — that is, below the range of human hearing. The frequencies generated by LFOs are used as control signals which modulate another component&#x27;s value, changing the output sound without introducing another source. Like a standard oscillator, this usually takes the form of a periodic waveform, such as a sine, sawtooth, triangle or square wave. Also like a standard oscillator, LFOs can incorporate any number of waveform types, including user-defined wavetables, rectified waves and random signals.

Using a low-frequency oscillation signal as a means of modulating another signal introduces complexities into the resulting sound, such that a variety of effects can be achieved. The specifics vary greatly depending on the type of modulation, the relative frequencies of the LFO signal and the signal being modulated, et cetera.

==Uses==

An LFO can be routed to control, for example, the frequency of the audio oscillator, its phase, stereo panning, filter frequency, or amplification. When routed to control pitch, an LFO creates vibrato. When an LFO modulates amplitude (volume), it creates tremolo. On most synthesizers and sound modules, LFOs feature several controllable parameters, which often include a variety of different waveforms, a rate control, routing options (as described above), a tempo sync feature, and an option to control how much the LFO will modulate the audio signal. LFOs can also be summed and set to different frequencies to create continuously changing slow moving waveforms, and when linked to multiple parameters of a sound, can give the impression that the sound is &quot;alive&quot;.

Electronic musicians use LFO for a variety of applications. They may be used to add simple vibrato or tremolo to a melody, or for more complex applications such as triggering gate envelopes, or controlling the rate of arpeggiation.

Differences between LFO rates also account for a number of commonly heard effects in modern music. A very low rate can be used to modulate a filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency, thereby providing the characteristic gradual sensation of the sound becoming clearer or closer to the listener. Alternatively, a high rate can be used for bizarre &#x27;rippling&#x27; sound effects (indeed, another important use of LFO is for various sound effects used in films). Dubstep and drum and bass are forms of electronic music that employ frequent use of LFOs, often synchronized to the tempo of the track, for bass sounds that have a &quot;wobble&quot; effect. For example, by modulating the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter to create a distinctive opening-and-closing effect. Due to the popularization of these genres, the LFO wobble is now being found in other forms of electronic dance music such as house music. LFO is commonly used in future bass music to enhance synthesisers, along with side-chain.

==In popular culture==
The British electronic music group LFO take their name directly from the low-frequency oscillator.

<doc id="1189967" wikidata="Q388230" url="?curid=1189967" title="Crofton, British Columbia">
<text>Crofton is a small west coast town within the District of North Cowichan of southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, east of BC Highway 1 about north of Victoria.

==Early settlers==
In the mid-1800s, several families obtained preemptions in the area, upon which they created homesteads, cut timber, and farmed. The 1873 incorporation of the District of North Cowichan included what would become Crofton.

==Smelter &amp; village==
In 1900, Henry Croft purchased land at Osborne Bay for a smelter and townsite. The next year, the Northwestern Smelting and Refining Co. began construction. In 1902, the village was established, the smelter opened, and Croft extended the Lenora Mt. Sicker Railway from his copper mine to Crofton. Mining ceased in late 1902 when the company went into receivership. Having exhausted other ore supplies, the smelter closed in 1903. In 1906, the Britannia Mining &amp; Smelting Company bought the smelter. A customs office existed between 1906 and 1909. Following plummeting copper prices during the Panic of 1907, the smelter closed in January 1908. Rumours of a large sawmill to be built came to nothing, and when Henry Croft died in 1917, his namesake was struggling to survive.

==Logging==
During the 1910s, the Westholme Lumber Co. was hauling locally harvested logs to Crofton over the narrow gauge line. By the mid-1920s, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway (E&amp;N) was arriving over the new Osborne Bay subdivision (later called the Crofton Spur) to ship out logs from the Osborne Bay wharf. Logging trains brought raw logs out of the bush to be barked in the water and loaded onto ships for export. Lumber was also shipped out by Industrial Timbers Ltd (later to become British Columbia Forest Products Ltd), Western Forest Industries, and MacMillan Bloedel Lumber Co.

==Pulp &amp; paper mill==
The Crofton pulp and paper mill, which opened in 1957, has experienced several changes in the ownership of its parent company.

In 2001, a layer of ash fell upon the town, staining nearly every house. Improper burning at the mill was determined the cause. In response, the mill owners funded the extensive cleanup of Crofton, and improved the burning process.

Concern about mill emissions prompted a Clean Air Concert on September 17, 2004, organized by Randy Bachman, to raise money for a study of those emissions. Among the groups participating were the Barenaked Ladies, Neil Young, Tal Bachman, and Randy himself. The concert was staged in Duncan, the nearest suitable venue.

==Ferry terminal==
The smelter wharf was converted to become the western terminal for the Salt Spring Island ferry service established in 1955. BC Ferries operates the route daily. Some tourist traffic spends time in Crofton.

==Present community==
Forestry and recreation have anchored the community in recent decades.

Early in the 1990s. the Crofton Community Centre Society created a scenic walkway along the Crofton shoreline. In 2002, Crofton&#x27;s 100th anniversary, phase one of the Seawalk was completed. By 2014, all three phases were complete. The Seawalk stretches from the wharf and ferry terminal to Crofton Beach, a distance of over one kilometre.

In 2000, the town water supply was changed from Crofton Lake to the Cowichan River.
In September 2006, Crofton was included in a regional bus network connecting to nearby Duncan and Chemainus. Previously, the only public transit was a bus between Victoria and Nanaimo without regional stops.

<text>The Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission (Nortraship) was established in London in April 1940 to administer the Norwegian merchant fleet outside German-controlled areas. Nortraship operated some 1,000 vessels and was the largest shipping company in the world. It made a major contribution to the Allied war effort.

The British politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate of 1959, Philip Noel-Baker commented after the war, &quot;The first great defeat for Hitler was the battle of Britain. It was a turning point in history. If we had not had the Norwegian fleet of tankers on our side, we should not have had the aviation spirit to put our Hawker Hurricanes and our Spitfires into the sky. Without the Norwegian merchant fleet, Britain and the allies would have lost the war&quot;.

Nortraship had its main offices in London and New York City and was active during World War II. Nortraship was vital to Norway and the exile government as it lacked other means to support the Allied fight against the Axis powers. The organisation handed the various vessels back to their owners when Norway was liberated in May 1945.

==Norwegian merchant fleet prior to World War II==
In the years after World War I the Norwegian merchant fleet recouped its losses and expanded into new sectors, primarily tankers but also dry cargo vessels. The 1930s, in particular, were a growth period, in contrast to the other major shipping nations. By the end of 1938, some 7% of world tonnage was Norwegian and Norway was the fourth-largest shipping nation, behind the UK, the US and Japan. Moreover, the expansion was based on new building, thus lowering the median age of Norwegian vessels. Most of the new vessels were powered by diesel motors; they accounted for some 62% of the fleet, while Japan had some 27%, and the UK 25%. Around 42% of the fleet was modern tankers, a total of 18% of the world tanker tonnage. Norwegian shipowners were innovative and willing to take risks in ordering new vessels during the depression.

The various services needed for operation of ships had also been expanded, the most important being the classification society Det Norske Veritas but also shipbrokers, insurance companies and shipping banks. The government also played an important part in establishing and updating regulations, and in providing schools for engineers and navigators.

==The forgotten war, 3 September 1939 – 9 April 1940==
When Norway was invaded by Germany on 9 April 1940, the merchant fleet had been at war for seven months. Norway was neutral, but lost 58 ships and around 400 sailors. During these months much of the framework that Nortraship was to operate within was created; most importantly the Norwegian-British tonnage agreement. Called the &quot;Scheme Agreement&quot;, this stated that a percentage of the Norwegian fleet, including two thirds of the tanker tonnage, was to go on charter to Britain. In return, Norway would receive important commodities. This agreement alleviated the British problem of access to the Norwegian fleet, especially the tankers, which they regarded as of &quot;exceptional importance&quot;. To protect Norwegian neutrality, the agreement was negotiated between the British government and the Norwegian Shipowners Association.

These negotiations showed the dual nature of the Norwegian merchant fleet: it was a huge asset and also was vital to both the belligerent factions. It was necessary to tread carefully to safeguard Norwegian neutrality but to maintain the close commercial relationship with Britain. Norway&#x27;s policy during World War I had been labelled that of &quot;the silent ally&quot;, and the Norwegian government wanted to continue along the same lines in World War II.

The reasons for Norway being so important for the Allies were the relative decline of the British merchant fleet, overly optimistic prewar tonnage planning and the US Neutrality Act, which effectively forbade US vessels from entering the war zone. The only other nation with a comparable merchant fleet was Netherlands, but they strongly rejected any tonnage agreement for fear of German reprisals.

The Norwegian government also established contingency plans for alerting vessels in case of war. To reduce the risk of being torpedoed, most Norwegian vessels followed British convoys. The added safety was not without problems, as Norway as a neutral country thus was close to siding with one of the belligerents. The convoying regime reflected Norway&#x27;s dependence on Britain, as had been the case during World War I.

==Norway invaded and Nortraship established==
With the German invasion of Norway, the question of control of the Norwegian merchant fleet became critical, and the Norwegian government, the British government and the Germans were the main contenders. Around 15% of the total fleet was within the German-controlled area and was lost to the Allies; the battle would be for the remaining 85% sailing worldwide.

The British contemplated confiscating the Norwegian merchant fleet, as they did with the Danish fleet, but decided against it because the Norwegians continued to fight and because of intervention by the Norwegian ambassador in London. The Germans and their Norwegian collaborator, Vidkun Quisling, radioed to Norwegian vessels to sail for German-controlled waters, but the Norwegian masters ignored the orders.

To counter German pressure, on 12 April the British Ministry of Shipping negotiated an agreement with the Norwegians that temporarily settled insurance problems for the Norwegian fleet, contingent on vessels sailing for Allied harbours, and this was radioed by the British Admiralty to all Norwegian merchant vessels. The next question was how the fleet was to be administered; the Norwegian ambassador was hard pressed on the issue by both Britain and Norwegian shipowners in London. The British government wanted to take control of the Norwegian vessels, but Norwegian shipping professionals in London favoured an independent Norwegian organisation. The issue had to be decided by the Norwegian government; it was, however, difficult to communicate with it as the government was fleeing the advancing German forces.

On 16 April, a meeting of Norwegian shipping professionals was held in the Norwegian chamber of commerce in London, where a detailed plan for an organisation for the merchant fleet was presented. The Norwegian ambassador, Erik Colban, and shipowner Ingolf Hysing Olsen were presented with the plan but were leaning towards a joint solution with the British Ministry of Shipping. The shipping professionals argued that a more independent organisation would be in a better position to safeguard Norwegian interests and the revenue from the fleet. As Colban and Hysing Olsen accepted this view, Nortraship was quickly set up on 19 April with the renting of offices at 144 Leadenhall Street in the City, and the following day, 20 April, the first shipping experts moved in.

The Norwegian government now came forward with a cable that stated that the merchant fleet was to be administered jointly from London and New York. This was a surprise for the Norwegian ambassador in London, and the British government was not in favour. British pressure resulted in the Norwegian government, in a meeting on 22 April at Stuguflåten in Romsdal, adopting a decree that would requisition the Norwegian merchant fleet for the Norwegian government. The administration should be in London and be led by Øivind Lorentzen, Norwegian Minister of Shipping. By that act, the largest shipping company in the world was created, with more than 1,000 vessels and around 30,000 seamen.

==London: the early days==
The main challenges for the new organisation were to take control of the around 1,000 vessels and to establish policies for working with Britain and the neutral US. There was a severe lack of qualified personnel, and those available were often vocal and determined and used to working independently. That several of the Nortraship staff had their own shipping interests to take care of further added to the problems of managing the organisation.

The top management was almost exclusively Norwegian, while the lower ranks were dependent on British and US personnel. An exception was the accounts department; a major British accounting firm staffed it. In October 1940 Nortraship had 230 employees in London; by October 1941 this was increased to 350, one-third Norwegians. At the same time, Nortraship New York had over 200 personnel, more than half of them Norwegians.

There were also legal problems to be solved, most crucially, whether Nortraship could have at its disposal vessels owned by shipowners still in occupied Norway. That could be solved by the Norwegian government appointing &quot;a curator to act on behalf of the Norwegian Owners&quot;. If that was not done, Nortraship vessels could be impounded in neutral harbours, such as in the US. After some discussion, the Norwegian government (still in Norway, now in Tromsø) declared by law on 18 May 1940 that Øivind Lorentzen was to act as curator.

The insurance problems remained to be solved, as the initial British offer was provisional. The vessels needed several categories of insurance, and they were cut off from the insurance provided by insurance companies in occupied Norway, as was the case for the main office of the classification society, the DNV (Det Norske Veritas). On 28 May 1940, Øivind Lorentzen signed a &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot; with the British Ministry of Shipping that solved the insurance issue for a period of three months. This MoU was to be the foundation for insurance agreements for the rest of the war. The classification problem was solved by Nortraship taking over the DNV branch offices around the world, coordinated from the DNV office in Newcastle upon Tyne.

As the fighting in France evolved disastrously, the British pushed for more tonnage and to harmonise wages: Norwegian seamen were paid significantly more than British. For political reasons, Nortraship received preferential treatment with an agreement signed on 20 June 1940. Reducing the Norwegian seamen&#x27;s wages solved the problem of unequal wages; the surplus was to be placed in a fund to be paid out after the war. (That was later to be a hotly-debated issue in postwar Norway.)

==New York: internal fighting==
After the initial organisation of Nortraship was clear, the business perspective came into focus. Nortraship was the exiled Norwegian government&#x27;s main source of income and while contributing to the war effort, had to be managed for the highest possible profit. The vessels that were ceded to the British were fixed and had subsidised rates; the remainder (the &quot;free ships&quot;) were primarily sailing for the (still neutral) US at market rates.

When Norway was invaded, German consuls boarded Norwegian vessels in several US harbours, attempting to have them sail for Norway. The Norwegian consulate did its best to counter this, and in deliberation with Norway&#x27;s ambassador in London, &quot;The Norwegian Shipping Committee&quot; in New York was established. Among the challenges was the crew problem; due to the agreement with the British wages had been reduced from 5 June 1940, and crews on the &quot;free ships&quot; enjoyed an increase. Nazis and communists tried to demoralise the crews and serious desertion problems were encountered, resulting in ships lying idle for months.

Meanwhile, in London, the British were hard pressed with France on the verge of defeat. Within Nortraship, the view was gaining ground that it was inexcusable not to have an adequate office in New York. In spite of resistance from the Norwegian ambassador, it was decided on 21 May 1940 to send a Nortraship delegation to New York, the reasons being both security in case of a German invasion and commercial since many Nortraship vessels called at US ports. The British Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax, was informed of the decision on 24 May 1940; the Foreign Ministry accepted only reluctantly.

The delegation arrived in New York on 11 June 1940 and started working with the already established committee, the main issues being organisation and the freight earnings from the &quot;free ships&quot; since until then, they had been kept by the shipowners or their US representatives. That resulted in a revolt by the Norwegian shipping professionals in New York who basically demanded the status quo. As the situation became critical, Øivind Lorentzen decided to travel to New York to sort it out. He arrived on 5 July 1940 and after a meeting with the interim committee it was dissolved on 15 July 1940, thus paving the way for the establishment of Nortraship&#x27;s New York office, which was located at 80 Broad Street, Manhattan.

Øivind Lorentzen had planned for only a brief visit in New York, and in his absence, Ingolf Hysing Olsen, Norwegian representative in Britain for the Norwegian Shipowners Association, was the acting head in London. Thus new friction was created, as the leaders of the two main Nortraship offices did not co-operate well. It was so severe that the Minister of Supply and Shipping, Trygve Lie, had to forward it to the government for a formal resolution. On 25 October the Norwegian government stated that the two offices were &quot;parallel enterprises, each working independently with its ships&quot;. This also resulted in a tally of ships; on 21 November 1940 London administered 570 ships while New York had 282 (whaling ships not included).

Nortraship had a large fleet, and the expenses were considerable and so a currency strategy was necessary. It was formulated by Arne Sunde (who later would become Minister of Shipping) on 1 August 1940 and stated that expenses should be paid in sterling currencies, and use of US dollars was to be avoided. The reasons were the current currency situation and the anticipated situation after the war.

In the autumn of 1940 Nortraship New York still had problems with &quot;free ships&quot;, most urgently, those owned by Fred. Olsen &amp; Co. The shipowner Thomas Olsen, residing in New York, insisted on managing them and argued that as the owner he was in the best position to do so. He was cautioned by Øivind Lorentzen, to no avail, and after Olsen wrote a letter to the government, Trygve Lie commented that Olsen&#x27;s behaviour was &quot;the kind that bordered on high treason&quot;. Olsen was not alone in his scepticism regarding Nortraship, and on 18 February 1941 the Norwegian Shipowners&#x27; Conference in America was established to secure Norwegian shipowners&#x27; interests outside Norway. Part of the scepticism was founded on the Norwegian government being Labour and thus possibly contemplating nationalisation of the shipping companies after the war. The Prime Minister rejected that suggestion, and in a cable in March 1941, he promised that all ships would be handed back to their owners as soon as possible when the war was over.

The internal quarrels were still not settled, partly because Øivind Lorentzen had ships managed contrary to Nortraship policy in the Nopal line led by his son Per A. Lorentzen, who was later head of Nortraship&#x27;s New York charter department. That was partly corrected after pressure from the London office in August 1940, but it damaged Lorentzen&#x27;s position as head of Nortraship and was a recurring theme for his critics. One of the sternest opponents of Lorentzen was Hilmar Reksten, a maverick shipowner who had himself been in the spotlight for bending Nortraship rules.

==More crewing problems==
During the summer and the autumn of 1940, ship losses catapulted. From 9 April to 30 December 1940, Nortraship lost 96 vessels and hundreds of seamen, almost all in the North Atlantic trade. That resulted in an increasing number of Norwegian seamen taking land-based work in the US or changing to other countries&#x27; ships running in less dangerous areas. The shortage of seamen was a huge challenge for Nortraship and the Norwegian exile government.

The seamen&#x27;s organisations argued that the only effective remedy would be higher wages. That resulted in wage negotiations started in London in June 1941 which were concluded with a new and significantly higher wages agreement effective 1 September 1941. The British government was highly critical, but Nortraship and the Norwegian government&#x27;s view was that it was impossible to withstand the seamen&#x27;s demand. A second round of negotiations were concluded in an agreement effective 1 December 1942, with yet higher wages, which one was to last for the rest of the war.

The need for strict discipline in wartime created other problems that were not easily solved. Even though the Norwegian government-in-exile decreed as early as 12 July 1940 that all Norwegian citizens above 18 had to register and take assigned work, that legislation was difficult to enforce as the government had no jurisdiction in the UK and no courts. That was facilitated by a law by the British government of 22 May 1941, the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act 1941, which gave allied governments the power to establish their own courts on British soil in which all but the most severe cases could be tried.

==Seaman and vessel safety==
The biggest threat to the vessels was the Axis submarines, although mines, surface raiders and bombing from aircraft were also much feared. The main countermeasure was convoying, large groups of merchant vessels, from 20 to 100, protected by naval ships. In 1940, the Norwegian vessels were unarmed, but defensive measures like guns against surfaced submarines and low-flying aircraft were slowly added. By the spring of 1945, around 1,700 men were registered as gunners on Norwegian vessels, and in addition, there were some 900 British gunners.

The vessels also received degaussing against magnetic mines, and seamen were issued watertight survival suits if the ship had to be abandoned. An important part of security was strict secrecy regarding routes and destinations, as made famous in the slogan &quot;Loose lips sinks ships&quot;.

Despite those and other measures, losses were high. Of a total of about 30,000 Norwegian seamen, 3,670 lost their lives as a result of the war at sea, together with 977 foreign crewmen. 706 ships were lost to enemy action.

==British pressure for more tonnage==
Even though most of the Norwegian ships were sailing for the Allies, the British in April 1941 wanted more. That was a delicate dilemma for Norway and Nortraship. On one hand, Norway, was allied with and dependent on Britain, but on the other, the &quot;free ships&quot; that were sailing from the neutral US generated hard US dollars, much needed for reconstruction of Norway after the war. Moreover, voyages to the British Isles were the most dangerous, and Nortraship argued that the modern Norwegian tankers would be better used in other trades. A more hidden agenda was the Norwegian fear that the British and the US would use the war to secure an unfair competitive postwar position.

An initial mutual understanding was reached in a meeting in the British Ministry of Shipping on 19 March 1941: Nortraship was to transfer 500,000 tons of its &quot;free ships&quot;. Even though the agreement was not officially signed until October, the work of tonnage transfer started.

Nortraship London under Hysing Olsen tended to favour the British, and Nortraship New York under Lorentzen had a more business-like stance. As Allied losses increased dramatically, the British on 29 April 1941 demanded all Norwegian ships. That was a total surprise for the Norwegians. Nortraship&#x27;s New York office tried to influence the US through the US Maritime Commission, arguing that Norwegian vessels were much needed for US import and export although only 30% of it was on US keel in 1939.

After hard negotiations with both the British and US shipping administrations, a new tonnage agreement was signed on 10 October 1941, effectively letting Britain charter three fourths of all Norwegian vessels.

In the negotiations, Nortraship tried to secure the US dollar freight income, to obtain a more equal footing with the British in governing the Allied merchant fleet and to receive assurances regarding Norwegian shipping rights after the war. In the currency issue, Nortraship&#x27;s stance seems to have prevailed, but in governing the Allied merchant fleet, an Anglo-Norwegian Shipping Committee was established, but despite scores of meetings, it handled the issue only superficially. Finally, the British gave only vague promises as to their postwar shipping policies. In the two years from 9 April 1940 to 9 April 1942, a total of 157 Norwegian tankers made 615 voyages and delivered 6.9 million tons of oil, supplying about a third of the total requirements of the British Isles.

==Tankers with clean/dirty oil and spar decks==
Before the age of specialised supertankers, the vessels could take &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; oil or change between them. The &quot;clean&quot; oil would be refined, as gasoline, and &quot;dirty&quot; was unrefined crude oil or heavy oil. A vessel carrying only &quot;clean&quot; oil would deteriorate faster and so an ongoing fight from both Nortraship offices was to get as many &quot;dirty&quot; cargoes as possible. Nortraship had a tough adversary in the British Ministry of War Transport, which produced statistics showing that British vessels were carrying more &quot;clean&quot; cargoes than the Norwegian. The US War Shipping Administration were more accommodating in the issue and let several Norwegian vessels change to &quot;dirty&quot; cargoes.

In peacetime, it is very rare for a tanker to take deck cargo. The war changed that since there was a huge demand for transporting large pieces of war equipment from the US to Europe and other war theatres. It was quickly figured out that tankers had large uncluttered deck areas, which could be used for volume cargoes, like airplanes and trucks. The tankers, however, had to be equipped with so-called &quot;spar decks&quot; where the cargo could be secured. On 1 January 1944, a total of 58 Norwegian tankers were equipped to take deck cargo. The installation of the spar decks was paid for by the UK and Nortraship did not ask any payment for deck cargo, as the charter for the oil cargo already covered the costs.

==US enters war==
Nortraship&#x27;s situation as a shipping enterprise changed dramatically when the US entered the war on 7 December 1941. When the US was neutral, Nortraship could benefit from the lack of tonnage and the increased rates. With the British Ministry of War Transport and the US War Shipping Administration coordinating their policies in the Hogmanay Agreement, Nortraship and its chief negotiator, Erling Dekke Næss, had a hard fight to protect Norwegian interests.

==Secret fund==
When Norway was dragged into the war, Norwegian sailors had significantly higher wages than other Allied sailors. The British government feared that would have a negative influence on the other Allied sailors and so pressed for wage reduction. In the summer of 1940, an agreement was signed whereby the wage difference would be placed in a special fund, to be used for the Norwegian war sailors after the war. When the war ended, the fund was some 43 million Norwegian kroner.

A vocal minority, with Leif Vetlesen as its spokesman, argued for the money to be paid directly to the sailors and not distributed as assistance to needy seamen and seamen&#x27;s widows, as the government and the seamen&#x27;s organisations proposed. It became a lengthy legal process that the government won in the Supreme Court of Norway in February 1954. That created much bitterness, and the issue was not permanently solved until the Norwegian Parliament, in 1972, decided to pay an &quot;ex gratia&quot; sum, a total of 155 million NOK. All seamen or their surviving relatives then received 180 kroner per month that had been sailed. Instrumental in solving the protracted case was Rear Admiral Thore Horve, himself a veteran from the war.

==Internal fighting==
As Nortraship was a huge organisation, with tens of thousand of people working around the world during five years of war, there were normally internal problems. The main ones were between the offices in New York and London, each led by determined shipowners: Øivind Lorentzen and Ingolf Hysing Olsen. The various intrigues by Hilmar Reksten constituted a special case, as he worked at both offices. Reksten had already got into trouble with Hysing Olsen when Reksten arrived in London in April 1940, as he had wrongly obtained an insurance settlement from one of his ships transferred to his accounts; which was to be handled by Nortraship, according to the requisition. Reksten was indeed a highly-competent shipping man, but after allying himself with various of the Nortraship leaders, he was in the end sidelined and expelled from the organisation.

Other problems were created by Arne Sunde, Minister of Provisioning in the Norwegian exile government from autumn 1940 and Minister of Shipping from 1942. Supported by his protégé, Reksten, he made various attempts to micromanage the two main Nortraship offices, which were in turn repudiated either by the powerful foreign minister Trygve Lie or by the prime minister Johan Nygaardsvold.

==Postwar==
When World War II ended in 1945, Nortraship&#x27;s main task was over even though the final settlement was only in 1964. Immediately after the end of hostilities in Europe, Nortraship had a very busy period, its work being governed by the Allied United Maritime Authority, which was tasked with controlling all international shipping until the end of the postwar transition period. Nortraships&#x27;s requisition of Norwegian ships ended on 30 September 1945, and as the various shipowners took charge of their vessels, Nortraship started the huge task of liquidating the organisation, which involved settling various claims, paying compensation for vessels etc. The original Nortraship organisation was terminated on 30 July 1958, and its remaining tasks were transferred to the trade department.

In spite of internal quarrels, Nortraship&#x27;s legacy was mainly positive. Norway retained control of its merchant fleet, it gave a vital contribution to the Allied war effort, Norway&#x27;s government-in-exile had a sound financial basis and the basis was maintained for continued Norwegian shipping after the war. When Minister Trygve Lie presented the final report to the Norwegian Parliament in 1964, the total financial contribution from Nortraship to Norwegian society during and after the war was shown to be 1,219,000,000 kroner.

During the Cold War, the Nortraship name was used for the organisation that would run the Norwegian fleet should there be a war. When the Cold War ended in 1991, the organisation was dissolved.

The Nortraship name again came into use after the 9/11 attacks, as the Norwegian Shipowners Association established a contingency committee on 1 January 2002. It has seven members, six civilians from various parts of the Norwegian maritime industry and one representative of the department of defence.

==In popular culture==
In 2022 the Norwegian film &quot;War Sailor&quot; directed by Gunnar Vikene, described the traumatic events of the sailors, and their families, who participated in the Norwegian convoys during World War II.

<doc id="1189974" wikidata="Q16060793" url="?curid=1189974" title="Rhapidophyllum">
<text>Rhapidophyllum hystrix, the needle palm, is a palm native to coastal margins of the subtropical eastern Gulf and south Atlantic states of the United States. Populations can be found from coastal southeast South Carolina, southward to Florida and west across the coastal plain of Mississippi and southern Alabama. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms in the world, and can be found growing in several areas with warm temperate climates.

== Description ==
The needle palm assumes a shrublike clumping form with several stems growing from a single base, the stems growing very slowly and tightly together, eventually forming a dense base tall, with numerous sharp needle-like spines produced between the leaves; these are long and protect the stem growing point from browsing animals. The whole plant can reach tall to the top of the erect central leaves.

It is a fan palm (Arecaceae, subfamily Coryphoideae), with the leaves with a long petiole terminating in a rounded fan of 8–16 leaflets; each leaf is up to long, with the leaflets up to long. The flowers are borne in dense, short clusters at the top of the stems; it is usually dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is a brown drupe about long.

== Taxonomy ==
It is the sole member of the genus &quot;Rhapidophyllum&quot;. The scientific name &quot;Rhapidophyllum&quot; means &quot;needle-leaf&quot;, while &quot;hystrix&quot; is from the scientific name of a genus of porcupines. The English name likewise refers to the needle-like spines produced at the petiole bases; for similar reasons, it is also occasionally called &quot;porcupine palm&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==

The needle palm is very popular among palm enthusiasts in temperate climates for its ability to tolerate modest cold. Some reports have claimed survival of temperatures as low as with heavy damage, but with the palm recovering. More realistic estimates are closer to with foliar damage. Recovery of winter damage of needle palms is much more precarious in climates with cool summers like the Pacific Northwest and northwestern Europe.

In the United States, needle palms are reliably cultivated along the East Coast from Florida to Connecticut, and along the entire West Coast from southern California to Washington. Across the interior of the USA, large well-established specimens have been growing in Tennessee, the southern Ohio Valley, and Washington, DC at the United States National Arboretum since the 1960s. It is the most popular landscaping palms in the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland. Needle palms need hot summers to thrive and the species does not grow well in the cool summer climates.

The needle palm is considered to be commercially exploited and therefore threatened. When purchasing this palm, it is wise to purchase it only from a reputable dealer, as some unscrupulous dealers harvest them directly from the wild.

<text>The Neoplan Centroliner is a series of low-floor transit buses which was first unveiled in 1997, and mainly built by Neoplan Bus GmbH for the European market. At the time when it was first released, it adopted contemporary technologies like Controller Area Network.

The product range of Centroliner included: midibus, full-size/articulated single-decker, and three-axle double-decker, in different body lengths. The rigids had 1 door, 2 door or 3 doors whereas the articulated have 2 doors, 3 doors or 4 doors. After the acquisition of Neoplan by MAN AG subsidy MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, a new version of Centroliner full-size/articulated single-decker was launched, it was also known as Neoplan Centroliner Evolution and was based on MAN Lion&#x27;s City with different bodywork. After restructuring of MAN&#x27;s bus division in 2009, Neoplan is concentrating exclusively on luxury coaches and due to that, Centroliner was discontinued without Neoplan-branded successor. Instead, MAN promotes Lion&#x27;s City as its successor.

==Specifications (2009)==
The Neoplan Centroliner is available in a range of styles and dimensions. , the Centroliner consists of the following specifications and powertrain detail.


==Hong Kong==
The Neoplan Centroliner was the third type of German double-decker introduced in Hong Kong (the first being the Mercedes-Benz O305, and the second the MAN 24.350 HOCLNR-NL). A total of 193 Neoplan Centroliner double-deckers were introduced to Hong Kong by Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New World First Bus (NWFB).

===Kowloon Motor Bus===

KMB received their first Neoplan Centroliner in September 1998, after the test-drive of the Neoplan Megashuttle in 1997. A total of 20 Centroliner N4026/3s (fleet number AP1-AP20), equipped with Cummins M11-305E21 straight six diesel engine and ZF Ecomat 5HP590 five-speed automatic transmission, entered service in August 1999.

In 2000, KMB received 60 Centroliner N4426/3s, followed by 50 similar buses in 2000/2001. They (AP21-AP130) were allocated to long-distance routes serving North/Yuen Long/Tuen Mun Districts.

In April 2001, KMB acquired two Centroliner N4426/3s (AP131-AP132) which were fitted with MAN D2866 LOH-27 straight six common rail Euro 3 turbodiesel engines, and either a four-speed Voith DIWA864.3E or five-speed ZF Ecomat 5HP602C transmissions. They were coated with special metallic &#x27;flip&#x27; paint, which shows different colours (mainly green and purple), depending on the angle of light reflection. They entered service in August 2001. One of them (AP131) was repainted in the standard KMB champagne gold livery in 2010.
In 2002, KMB acquired a further 30 Centroliner N4426/3s (AP133-AP162) with MAN Euro 3 engines. Two of them (fleet number AP144, AP159) are the world&#x27;s first two transit buses to be equipped with six-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is a modified ZF Ecomat 6HP602C. They were the test buses of &quot;Eco-driveline&quot; (with large differential gear ratio, engine with high low-end torque and six-speed automatic gearbox).

Withdrawal of the first batch of Neoplan Centroliners started in 2016. The last were retired in 2018.

In May 2003, KMB received a NEOMAN Centroliner N4426/3 (APM1) with MAN ND313F chassis and straight staircase. The width of the bus has increased from to , and is equipped with MAN D2866 LUH-24 straight six engine, four-speed Voith DIWA864.3E transmission, and ventilated disc brakes on all wheels. The bus was painted in gold with dark brown skirt, which is the standard livery for other straight-staircase low-floor buses such as TransBus Enviro500 and Wright-bodied Volvo Super Olympian. It was registered in October 2003. It has been criticised for its frequent breakdowns and extra difficulty in maintenance and so it has remained as a reserve bus since it entered service. This bus remained unique in KMB fleet and was retired on 16 January 2019.

===New World First Bus===

After KMB put its first 20 Centroliners into service, NWFB announced the order of 30 Neoplan Centroliner N4426/3s in October 1999. They were delivered in 2000 and entered service in 2000/2001.

Since 2004, a number of these buses have been suspended from service. Some believe that it is caused by the difficulty in maintenance by NWFB, or due to the fleet quota limit set by the Transport Department of Hong Kong. However, the actual reason is not clearly known. All of them have been put back into the fleet.

The last Neoplan Centroliner in NWFB (Fleet numbers 6024, 6027, 6030) was retired in February 2019, indicating that there are no more Neoplan Centroliners in franchised service.

===Sun Bus===
Sun Bus acquired two Neoplan Centroliners (formerly AP144, 146) from Kowloon Motor Bus, so that they could provide high capacity non-franchised private hire vehicles.

They first appeared as a shuttle for tourists from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in a KMB gold livery with no logo.

In December 2019, former AP146 toppled to its side on the roof of KMB&#x27;s Lai Chi Kok depot. The bus was repaired and was put back into service two months later. The bus later retired in mid-2020.

===July 2003 Tuen Mun Road bus accident===

A Kowloon Motor Bus Centroliner (fleet number AP69) was forced off a viaduct by a lorry on Tuen Mun Road on 10 July 2003 and was subsequently written off. The remains of the bus were then sent to Long Win Bus&#x27;s depot in Siu Ho Wan for inspection and storage. The remains were finally sold for scrap in 2008.

In total, 21 people (20 passengers and a bus driver) were killed in this accident, making this the deadliest road accident in Hong Kong history. The lorry driver involved was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. He later appealed against the rulings, which were subsequently overturned. He was then found guilty of &quot;careless driving&quot;, and his sentence was shortened to six months.

<text>Cuddalore, also spelt as Kadalur (), is a heavy industries hub and a port city, and headquarters of the Cuddalore District in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Situated south of Chennai, Cuddalore was an important city and port during the British Raj.

While the early history of Cuddalore remains unclear, the city first rose to prominence during the Pallavas&#x27; and Medieval Cholas&#x27; reign. After the fall of the Cholas, the town was ruled by various dynasties like Pandyas, Vijayanagar Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks, Thanjavur Marathas, Tipu Sultan, French and the British Empire. Cuddalore was the scene of the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Battle of Cuddalore in 1758 between the French and British. It has been a part of independent India since 1947. During the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the subsequent tsunamis generated, Cuddalore was one of the affected towns, with 572 casualties.

Apart from fishing and port-related industries, Cuddalore houses chemical, pharmacological and energy industries in SIPCOT, an industrial estate set up by the state government. The city is administered by municipal corporation covering 101.6 km2 . It had a population of 308,781 in 2011. Cuddalore is a part of the Cuddalore legislative assembly constituency, a part of the Cuddalore Lok Sabha constituency. There are 25 schools, two arts and science colleges and two engineering colleges in the city. There is one government hospital, six municipal maternity homes, and 42 other private hospitals that take care of the citizens&#x27; healthcare needs. Roadways are the primary means of transportation, while the town also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is Chennai International Airport, located 200 km (120 mi) away from the city, and another local airport is located in the district at Neyveli township is Neyveli Airport. The nearest seaport is Cuddalore Port where it handles small cargo ships, and the construction of port entry is underway. The closest major seaport is Karaikal port, located 100 km (62 mi) away from the town. Cuddalore is famous for educational institutions and medical establishments.

==Etymology==
Before the English took control, Cuddalore (anglicised) was called &quot;கூடலூர்&quot;, &quot;Kūṭalūr&quot; meaning confluence in Tamil. It is situated on the backwater formed by the confluent estuaries of the rivers viz.,
Ponnaiyar (South Pennar river flowing through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), Kedilam, Uppanar and Paravanar. The Cuddalore district historically consisted of Chola Nadu and Nadu Naadu. The name &quot;Nadu Naadu&quot; meaning middle country may originate from its location between Chola Nadu and &quot;Tondaimandalam&quot;; or between the Pallavas and the Cholas; or between central territories and the ocean.

==History==

From ancient times the old town has been a seaport. For two centuries, Cuddalore was subject to several foreign powers including the Netherlands, Portugal, France, and the British. Until 1758 Cuddalore was the capital to the South Indian territories which were under British control. Britain ruled a more significant part of South India (entire Tamil Nadu, parts of present Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from this fort (St. David).

In the early 17th century, the Dutch obtained permission from the ruler of Cuddalore to build a fort there, but political pressure from their Portuguese rivals forced them to abandon it.

Later, the French and English came to Cuddalore for trade and business. The French established a settlement up the coast at Pondicherry in 1674, followed in 1690 by Fort St. David&#x27;s British colony at Cuddalore.

During the 18th century, various wars between the European powers spilt over to their colonial empires, and their allies, including those in the Indian subcontinent. During this period the French and British fought several times in the area.

In 1746, during First Carnatic War, part of the Austrian Succession War, French forces besieged the British at Fort St. David for several months before being driven off in 1747.

In 1758, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the French took the fort, and there was an inconclusive naval action, the Battle of Cuddalore, off the coast. The fort was later abandoned, in 1760, when the British attacked Pondicherry.

In 1782, during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the French again took Cuddalore at the time of the American War of Independence and were besieged there in 1783 by the British. During the siege French and British naval forces again clashed off the Cuddalore coast. The siege failed, but the fort was returned to the British in 1795. There were five different naval actions off the coast during this period, all of which were indecisive.

Some Cuddalore streets retain their British names, such as Clive Street, Wellington Street, Sloper Street, Canning Street, Rope Street (Rope Street, Wellington Street, Sloper Street and Canning Street jointly known as Salangukara Village), Lawrence Road and Imperial Road. The Cuddalore Central Prison, opened in 1865, is a historically significant landmark. Subramania Bharati and other political leaders served prison terms there.

Tsunami waves that followed the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake near Sumatra hit India&#x27;s eastern coast on 26 December 2004 at 8:32 a.m. (IST), resulting in 572 casualties. Several fishing hamlets disappeared, while Silver Beach and the historically significant Cuddalore Port was devastated. Fort St. David survived without damage. On 30 December 2011, Cyclone Thane caused widespread damage to crops and buildings.

==Geography==
Cuddalore is located at  11°45′N 79°45′E / 11.75°N 79.75°E / 11.75; 79.75. It has an average elevation of 6 m (20 ft). The land is completely flat with large black and alluvial soil inland and coarse sand near the seashore. The sandstone deposits in the town are popular. The Pennayar River runs north of the town, while Gadilam River runs across it. Cuddalore is situated at 200 km (120 mi) from the state capital Chennai and 18 km (11 mi) from Puducherry, the neighbouring union territory.

== Geology ==
The Cuddalore Formation of the Cauvery Basin received siliciclastic detritus from inland areas of the Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT). It represented continental–fluvial sedimentation in the eastern continental margin of South India during the Miocene. Indian Summer Monsoon was thought to be initiated in the early Miocene and intensified during the middle Miocene causing major climatic shifts in the Indian subcontinent. In the present work, detailed mineralogical and geochemical studies on the siliciclastic Cuddalore Formation have been carried out to understand the provenance and paleoclimatic conditions during the Miocene. The paleocurrent direction, textural immaturity and framework detrital modes of sandstones suggest rapid uplift of basement and sediment source from nearby Madras Block of SGT. Various diagnostic immobile trace element ratios such as Th/Sc, Co/Th, La/Sc, La/Co suggest a tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite–charnockite provenance, and somewhat more felsic composition of source area compared to the present upper continental crust (UCC).

===Climate===
Cuddalore experiences a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;As&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. Cuddalore witnesses heavy rainfall during the North-East monsoon.

==Economy==

Being a coastal town, historically, Cuddalore&#x27;s primary industry was fishing. Although Cuddalore was once a port town, the shipping trade has now moved to larger centres. Cuddalore also hosts the heavy chemical, pharmacological and energy industries in SIPCOT, an industrial estate set up by the state government. The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) planned to commence power plants around the town.

The industrial development in Cuddalore&#x27;s recent past has resulted in extreme pollution. SIPCOT, the central industrial area in the town is a &quot;global toxic hotspot.&quot; Local communities have voiced concern about industrialization and pollution. The SIPCOT chemical industry estate in Cuddalore was investigated in November 2002 by a team from the Indian People&#x27;s Tribunal headed by J. Kanakaraj. The group reported &quot;a noticeable stench of chemicals in the air&quot;. The report published in July 2003 noted that &quot;Villages like Kudikadu, Thaikal, Eachangadu and Sonnanchavadi lie in a virtual &#x27;gas chamber&#x27; surrounded on three sides by chemical factories and bounded on the fourth by the river&quot;. There are reports of illegal dumping of toxic waste. On 22 March 2008, a report for the &quot;Tamil Nadu Pollution Board&quot; prepared by the Nagpur-based &quot;National Environmental Engineering Research Institute&quot; found that residents of the SIPCOT area of Cuddalore were at least 2000 times more likely than their counterparts to contract cancer in their lifetimes due to exposure to high levels of toxic gases from chemical industries in the region.

The Cuddalore Port operates at the confluence of the Gadilam River and the Paravanar River. The ships anchor in midstream at about from the shore, where cargo is loaded and discharged through lighters. There is a bar at the mouth of the combined river, which maintains a depth of at low water. During July to September, the depth over the bar is reduced to about . Other ports under construction in Cuddalore are Thiruchopuram port, Silambimangalam port, Parangipettai port (Porto Nova) and PY-03 Oil Field (operational).

==Tourism==

Pataleeswarar Temple, a Hindu temple, built during the 7th century and dated a millennium earlier, is the most prominent landmark in Cuddalore. The name, Thirupathipuliyur, is associated with the legend behind the temple. The temple is revered in the verses of 7th-century Saiva saints Appar and Tirugnanasambandar in their works in &quot;Tevaram&quot;.

The Devanathaswami Temple, located in Thiruvanthipuram, is another Hindu pilgrimage site around Cuddalore.

Silver Beach is a long beach located in Cuddalore and is another prominent visitor attraction of the town. Pichavaram, which is 57 km from Cuddalore, is a mangrove forest.

Fort St David, situated on the River Gadilam near Devanampattinam and acquired in 1653 CE by Elihu Yale, a Christian slave-trader and cruel slave master, is one of the most visited tourist attraction in Cuddalore. The wealth embezzled and extracted by him was infused into Yale University. Only two decades later, in 1677, when Shivaji captured Gingee, the fort fell into the Marathas&#x27; hands. In 1690, the British East India Company purchased the fort and the adjacent villages (within &quot;ye randome shott of a piece of ordnance&quot;.) A great gun was fired to different points of the compass. All the country within its range, including the town of Cuddalore, passed into English possession. The villages thus obtained are called &quot;cannonball villages&quot;. The fortifications were strengthened in 1693, 1698, 1702, 1725, 1740 and 1745. In 1746 Fort St. David became the British headquarters for British India. The British ruled a more significant part of south India (Tamil Nadu, parts of the present- Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from Fort St. David. An attack by Dupleix was successfully repulsed. In 1756, Clive was appointed governor. The French captured the fort in 1758 but in 1760 relinquished it to Sir Eyre Coote of the British East India Company. The French recaptured the fort in 1782 and held it in 1783 during the Battle of Cuddalore. In 1785 the fort passed into British possession. By this time, however, the centre of British rule was Fort St George.

The Garden House was the official residence of the Cuddalore District Collector, Robert Clive. It is typical of later medieval architecture. The Garden House roof was built using only bricks and slaked lime with no steel and wood.

Satyagnana Sabha (சத்ய ஞான சபை, literally &quot;Temple of Wisdom&quot;) is a temple constructed by saint Sri Raamalinga Swaamigal (Vallalaar) in the town of Vadalur in Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, India on 25 January 1872. It is an octagonal structure; the &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; of this temple is concealed from the main hall by seven curtains which are parted only on the Thai Poosam day. All the four towers of the Chidambaram Nataraajar temple are visible from the sabha. The temple is open year-round. Thousands of visitors attend festivals and monthly puja dates at this temple. Vadalur is well connected by rail and road, and it provides transport to major cities like Trichy, Chennai, Tanjore, Puducherry, and Kumbakonam.

<doc id="1190004" wikidata="Q157364" url="?curid=1190004" title="Trachycarpus">
<text>Trachycarpus is a genus of ten species of palms native to Asia, from the Himalaya east to eastern China. They are fan palms (subfamily Coryphoideae), with the leaves with a bare petiole terminating in a rounded fan of numerous leaflets. The leaf bases produce persistent fibres that often give the trunk a characteristic hairy appearance. All species are dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on separate plants although female plants will sometimes produce male flowers, allowing occasional self-pollination.

==Cultivation and uses==
The most common species in cultivation is &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; (Chusan palm or windmill palm), which is the northernmost naturally-growing palm species in the world. Cities as far north as London, Dublin, Paris, Seattle and Vancouver have long term cultivated palms in several areas. The dwarf form, known as &quot;T. wagnerianus,&quot; is unknown in the wild, and is now considered synonymous with &quot;T. fortunei&quot; or treated as a cultivar of that species. It resembles &quot;T. fortunei&quot; closely, differing only in its smaller and stiffer leaves. Hybrids between the two are intermediate in size and fully fertile.

&quot;Trachycarpus takil&quot; (the Kumaon palm) is similar to &quot;T. fortunei&quot; and probably even hardier. Other species less common in cultivation are &quot;T. geminisectus&quot;, &quot;T. princeps&quot;, &quot;T. latisectus&quot;, &quot;T. martianus&quot;, &quot;T. nanus&quot; and &quot;T. oreophilus&quot;. &quot;Trachycarpus martianus&quot; and &quot;T. latisectus&quot; do not tolerate cold as well as &quot;T. fortunei&quot; or &quot;T. takil&quot;. &quot;Trachycarpus geminisectus&quot;, &quot;T. princeps&quot; and &quot;T. oreophilus&quot; are still too rare and small in cultivation to assess their full potential. Two additional species have been described recently: &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; &quot;ukhrulensis&quot; from Manipur and &quot;T. ravenii&quot; from Laos; the former is known from cultivation as &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; sp. &quot;Manipur&quot; or &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; sp. &quot;Naga Hills&quot;.

The trunk fibres produced by the leaf sheaths of &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; are harvested in China and elsewhere to make coarse but very strong rope, brooms and brushes. This use gives rise to the old alternative name &quot;hemp-palm&quot;. The fibrous leaf sheaths are also frequently used to clothe the stems of artificial palms.

This genus is very popular among palm enthusiasts for its ability to withstand cold, especially in the form of damp, cool summer weather with relatively mild winter weather. These palms often tolerate snow in their native habitats and are the hardiest trunking palms.

&quot;Trachycarpus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Paysandisia archon&quot; (recorded on &quot;T. fortunei&quot;).

==Species==
As of January 2025, the genus &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; comprises 10 accepted species.

<text>Grip () is an archipelago and deserted fishing village in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is located about northwest of the town of Kristiansund in the Norwegian Sea. The Grip Lighthouse, one of the tallest lighthouses in Norway, is located on one of the islands of Grip. The historic Grip Stave Church is located on the island of Gripholmen. From 1897 until 1964, the islands were part of Grip Municipality, but the islands were merged into Kristiansund Municipality in 1964.

==Archipelago==
The Grip archipelago consists of 82 islets and skerries about into the Norwegian Sea northwest off the town of Kristiansund. The fishing village of Grip (no permanent residents) is located on Gripholmen, which is the largest and only habitable islet. On the south side of the fishing village is the main harbor, protected by two breakwaters. The older and northern harbour is smaller and less protected. Other breakwaters protects the fishing village from large ocean waves. The highest point is just above mean sea level.

The Inngripan group of skerries lies about closer to Kristiansund, where a small storm shelter offered protection for shipwrecked fishermen. The storm shelter has recently been restored.

Since all the turf and vegetation on Gripholmen was removed to provide clean cliffs for drying cod there was little room for agriculture. Only a few tiny gardens remained. The inhabitants could keep one or two cows grazing on the nearby islet of Grønningen, and a few hens and pigs. After being depopulated in 1974, Grip is slowly revegetating.

==The Sea village==

The first indications of settlement at Grip is from the ninth century, where fishermen settled close to the fishing grounds. Grip might because of that, be the oldest settlement in the Nordmøre district. Exports of fish from Norwegian fishing villages became important during the monopoly of the Hanseatic League. The Grip Stave Church is thought to have been constructed around 1470. The village belonged to the archbishop of Norway until the protestant reformation in 1537, when king Christian III seized all church properties in Norway.

Merchant Hans Horneman in Trondheim bought the islet from King Frederick IV in 1728 and the fishermen and their families became, in effect, vassals. The fishermen had to sell the catch to the merchants at a price decided by them later. This arrangement lasted until it was forbidden in 1893. The merchants, becoming landlords, also bought most of the private properties.

Storm surges destroyed most of the fishing village in 1796 and again in 1804, leaving only the church and a few other houses. The first breakwaters were constructed in 1882 and a harbor capable of landing small ships was not ready until 1950. The new harbour provided excessive materials which were used to create a small football pitch.

The population fluctuated for centuries, following the profitability of fishing, between 100 and 400 people. A now deserted village, it was once a busy place, when 2,000 fishermen could stay there during the height of the fishing season, when fishermen rowed and sailed to Grip from all over, to catch cod. Centralization led to a declining population after World War II, and Grip became deserted in 1974 when Hildur and Kasper Larsen left just before Christmas.

After being deserted, the old houses have become popular summer houses, and in the summer Grip has 150-250 residents in 44 housing units, primarily the earlier population and their descendants in Kristiansund. The harbour is still a popular dock for small fishing vessels, and the village is a popular destination for tourism in Kristiansund.

Beginning in 1895, public transportation between Grip and Kristiansund was established by steamship and in the period from 1914 to 1972 by motorboat. Today a passenger ferry connects Grip to Kristiansund in the summer season with one or two 30-minute crossings from the town centre every day.

When the diesel generator was started in 1950, the population was supplied with electric energy. The summer residents now get their electricity from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night with two generators installed in the local power station, totaling 210 kVA power. The power station was privatized in 1992. The archipelago has mobile phone coverage from a radio tower in Kristiansund. There is no natural source of fresh water, so the residents collect rainwater, flush the toilets with seawater, and travel to town to do their laundry.

Infrared cameras with a complete view of the village are monitored from the fire station in Kristiansund as fire protection. In 2011, the world&#x27;s smallest fire truck was delivered, and the summer residents were trained in operating the equipment.

The old schoolhouse has been turned into an inn and post office, and one of the boathouses in the harbour and the temperance movement&#x27;s lodge serves as community houses.

==Etymology==
The name is first recorded in 1338 as &quot;Gripar&quot; () which is a plural form of the word (which makes sense since Grip is an archipelago). The etymology of the name is uncertain, but it is maybe related to the Norse verb which means &quot;catch&quot;, &quot;seize&quot;, or &quot;grip&quot;. If this is the case, then it probably refers to the catching of fish here.

<text>Closed Casket is the fourth studio album by Esham, released on November 22, 1994, and distributed by Reel Life Productions/Warlock Records.

== Lyrics and music ==

Because of the Satanic themes of his earlier work, Esham had been accused of Satanism. Feeling that the lyrical content of his albums was being taken too seriously, Esham decided that after producing one final album with such material, he would no longer rap about the Devil.

Jason Birchmeier noted that &quot;the production improves upon past albums, not as reliant on samples and obviously more crafted&quot;.

== Reception ==

Allmusic wrote &quot;most fans taking a chronological approach to his catalog should be fairly numb to Esham&#x27;s exploitative shock attempts. Yet if this is one of your first experiences with Esham the Unholy, this album should pack a punch with its dark nature.&quot;

<doc id="1190017" wikidata="Q2697028" url="?curid=1190017" title="Zaat">
<text>Zaat is a 1971 American independent science fiction horror film produced and directed by Don Barton, and co-written by Barton, Lee O. Larew and Ron Kivett. Produced on a $50,000 budget, the film stars Marshall Grauer as a mad scientist who aims to transform himself into a mutation to seek revenge on those who spurned him.

Critical reception has been predominantly negative, with criticism directed at the film&#x27;s script, acting, and poor monster design. Cited as one of the worst films ever made, it gained significant exposure when it was used in an episode of the movie-mocking television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in May 1999, under its alternate title Blood Waters of Dr. Z.

== Plot ==
In his laboratory, mad scientist Dr. Kurt Leopold contemplates his former colleagues&#x27; derision for his &quot;formula&quot;, &quot;ZaAt&quot;, a compound that can transform humans into sea creature hybrids. He injects himself with the serum and immerses himself in a tank, emerging as a catfish-like monster. In his new form, Leopold releases walking catfish across the town&#x27;s lakes and rivers, and releases &quot;Zaat&quot; into the water supply, rendering many of the townspeople ill. All the while, Sheriff Lou Krantz and marine biologist Rex Baker investigate the strange happenings with the local catfish and the waterways.

Leopold turns his attention to killing those who mocked his work. He murders former colleague Maxson and his family on a boat, followed by associate Ewing in his home. Leopold returns to the lake where he kidnaps a young female camper. Taking her back to his lab, the doctor straps her in a mesh basket beside the large water tank, with the intention to make her his mate. However, due to her struggling, the equipment malfunctions, and her corpse, partially transformed, is pulled from the tank.

Baffled by the deaths, Rex contacts an organization known as INPIT, which sends scientists Martha Walsh and Walker Stevens to the town. Following kidnapping Martha, Leopold heads towards his lab, followed by Walker, who has picked up Leopold&#x27;s radioactive trail. The doctor arrives at the lab with Martha, where Rex and Lou happen to be searching. A fight ensues and Leopold fatally wounds them. He injects Martha with &quot;Zaat&quot;, readies her to be dunked into the tank, and makes his getaway with canisters of the compound. Martha&#x27;s transformation fails, and she is saved from the tank by a dying Rex, although she appears to be in a trance and immediately follows Leopold into the sea.

==Cast==
==Production==
Jacksonville, Florida resident Don Barton serves as director, producer and co-writer, alongside Lee O. Larew and Ron Kivett.

Filming took place over one month in 1970 on a $75,000 budget, $50,000 for production and $25,000 for to film prints and advertising. Locations include various Florida locales, such as Rainbow Springs, Green Cove Springs and Marineland.

==Release==
The film was originally distributed by Horizon Films. It was shown in Jacksonville as well as in theaters in mostly southern states during its original theatrical release. It was also shown in a theater in Manhattan&#x27;s 42nd Street through Aquarius Releasing, known for distributing exploitation films. It was shown in the theater for one day before being pulled, with the movie only making $200. In 1983, the movie was re-released by Capitol Productions. In 1985, it was released under the title &quot;Attack of the Swamp Creatures&quot;, which had new cast and production credits added to it. &quot;Zaat&quot; was originally released on video by ThrillerVideo under the &quot;Attack of the Swamp Creature&quot; title, with popular horror hostess Elvira hosting and spoofing the film throughout. In 2001, the film was released on video for its thirtieth anniversary under the &quot;Zaat&quot; title. Limited to five hundred copies, the videotapes were autographed by Don Barton and co-writer Ron Kivett.

In February 2012, it was later issued on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time by Film Chest and HD Cinema Classics. Digitally restored in HD and transferred from original 35mm elements, the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack also contained a feature-length audio commentary by cast and crew, the original 35mm trailer, television spots, outtakes, a radio interview, a before-and-after restoration demo, and an original movie art postcard.

== Reception ==
Dennis Schwartz from &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot;, grading the film on an A+ to F scale, awarded the film a &quot;C&quot;. In his review, Schwartz called the film &quot;[an] overlong and boring mad scientist monster film&quot;, criticizing the film&#x27;s acting, direction, excessive use of filler scenes, and an unimaginative climax. Dave Sindelar on his &quot;Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings&quot; wrote, &quot;The concept is ridiculous (let’s face it – catfish just aren’t scary), the plot is primitive, the acting is very weak, and the direction isn’t good. Nonetheless, the film is full of unintentionally funny dialogue, the use of sound and music is unique (if wrongheaded), and it’s more charmingly primitive than excruciatingly dull.&quot; Robert L. Jerome from &quot;Cinefantastique&quot;, while noting the movie had the right ideas in it, called it a &quot;fiasco&quot; for its implementation. &quot;VideoHound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever&quot; by Jim Craddock gave it zero stars. Keith Phipps for The A.V. Club described the film as being simultaneously &quot;Awful&quot; and &quot;Awfully charming&quot;.

Critic Jeffrey Kauffman said, &quot;this is the sort of film Ed Wood, Jr. might have made—on a bad day&quot; and added, &quot;Lovers of fantastically bad films rate &quot;Zaat&quot; one of the worst&quot;. Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, &quot;The acting in &quot;Zaat&quot; is below subpar. Actors seem to be whispering their lines and trying hard not to fully comprehend that they&#x27;re in one of the worst films ever made&quot;, while Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict also claimed, &quot;&quot;Zaat&quot; may be one of the worst films ever created&quot;. NPR called it a &quot;sci-fi fiasco&quot; when it became &quot;the winner — er, loser —&quot; on IMDb″s Bottom 100.

== Legacy ==

=== &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; ===
Cult television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; featured &quot;Zaat&quot; in a season 10 episode under the title &quot;Blood Waters of Dr. Z&quot;. The episode, which originally aired May 2, 1999, mocked the film&#x27;s low-budget effects and general tepidity. Director Don Barton was reportedly annoyed with &quot;MST3K&quot; for mocking his movie, but later clarified that the only reason he was annoyed was that Syfy (then known as the Sci-Fi Channel) had failed to secure the proper rights to the film. Barton issued a cease and desist and a lawsuit, so Syfy pulled the episode, and only reran it twice two years later when they had cleared the issue with Barton out of court.

In 2010, Shout! Factory released the &quot;MST3K&quot; episode as part of the &quot;Volume XVII&quot; DVD collection of the series, along with &quot;The Crawling Eye&quot;, &quot;The Beatniks&quot;, and &quot;The Final Sacrifice&quot;. The boxset was later discontinued and the episode was repackaged with &quot;The Lost and Found Collection&quot; in 2018.

<text>Trachycarpus fortunei, also known as the Chusan palm, Chinese windmill palm, or simply the Windmill palm, is a species of hardy evergreen palm tree in the family Arecaceae, native to parts of China, Japan, Myanmar, and India.

==Description==
Growing to tall, &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; is a single-stemmed fan palm. The diameter of the trunk is up to . Its texture is very rough, with the persistent leaf bases clasping the stem as layers of coarse dark grey-brown fibrous material. The leaves have long petioles which are bare except for two rows of small spines, terminating in a rounded fan of numerous leaflets. Each leaf is long, with the petiole long, and the leaflets up to long. It is a somewhat variable plant, especially as regards its general appearance; and some specimens are to be seen with leaf segments having straight and others having drooping tips.

The flowers are yellow (male) and greenish (female), about across, borne in large branched panicles up to long in spring; it is dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on separate trees. The fruit is a yellow to blue-black, reniform (kidney-shaped) drupe long, ripening in mid-autumn.

==Distribution and habitat==
This plant has been cultivated in China and Japan for thousands of years. This makes tracking its natural range difficult. It is believed to originate in central China (Hubei southwards), southern Japan (Kyushu), south to northern Myanmar and northern India, growing at altitudes of .

&quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; is one of the hardiest palms. It tolerates cool, moist summers as well as cold winters, as it grows at much higher altitudes than other species, up to in the mountains of southern China. However, it is not the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, as European fan palm (&quot;Chamaerops humilis&quot;) grows further north in the Mediterranean.

==Uses==
&quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; has been cultivated in China and Japan for thousands of years, for its coarse but very strong leaf sheath fibre, used for making rope, sacks, and other coarse cloth where great strength is important. The extent of this cultivation means that the exact natural range of the species is uncertain.

===Cultivation===
&quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; is cultivated as a trunking palm in gardens and parks throughout the world in warm temperate and subtropical climates. Its tolerance of cool summers and cold winters makes it valued by palm enthusiasts, landscape designers and gardeners. It is grown successfully in cool climates such as the UK, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, coastal Poland as well as southern and western Germany. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Due to its widespread use as an ornamental plant, the palm has become naturalised in southern regions of Switzerland, and has become an invasive species of concern.

In North America, mature specimens can be found growing in the coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest, the upper southern states, and Mid-Atlantic states. They can found growing along the West Coast from California north to coastal southwestern British Columbia, and along the East Coast from northern Florida to coastal Connecticut. Lower tolerance limits of are commonly cited for mature plants. Young plants are less hardy, and can be damaged by only . Lowest cold tolerance of well documented specimans include in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which has survived a low temperature of -27.5 °C. 

The cultivar group &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot; &#x27;Wagnerianus&#x27; is a small-leafed semi-dwarf variant of the species selected in cultivation in China and Japan. It differs in rarely growing to more than tall, with leaflets less than long; the short stature and small leaves give it greater tolerance of wind exposure. It has often been treated as a separate species &quot;T. wagnerianus&quot; in popular works, but is now included within &quot;T. fortunei&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===
The young flower buds are cooked and eaten in a variety of ways.

==Nomenclature==
The species was brought from Japan (Dejima) to Europe by the German physician Philipp Franz von Siebold in 1830. The common name refers to Chusan Island (now Zhoushan Island), where Robert Fortune first saw cultivated specimens. In 1849, Fortune smuggled plants from China to the Kew Horticultural Gardens and the Royal garden of Prince Albert of the United Kingdom. It was later named &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;, after him. It was first described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1850 in his &quot;Historia Naturalis Palmarum&quot; but under the illegitimate name of &quot;Chamaerops excelsa&quot;.

The names &quot;Chamaerops excelsus&quot; and &quot;Trachycarpus excelsus&quot; have occasionally been misapplied to &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;; these are correctly synonyms of &quot;Rhapis excelsa&quot;, with the confusion arising due to a misunderstanding of Japanese vernacular names.

<doc id="1190033" wikidata="Q332219" url="?curid=1190033" title="Helsinki Olympic Stadium">
<text>The Helsinki Olympic Stadium (; ), located in the Töölö district about from the centre of the Finnish capital Helsinki, is the largest stadium in the country. The stadium is best known for being the centre of activities in the 1952 Summer Olympics. During those games, it hosted athletics, equestrian show jumping, and the football finals.

The stadium was also the venue for the first Bandy World Championship in 1957, the first and 10th World Athletics Championships, in 1983 and 2005. It hosted the European Athletics Championships in 1971, 1994 and 2012. It is also the home stadium of the Finland national football team.

The stadium reopened in August 2020 after 4 years of renovation.

==History==

The Olympic Stadium was designed by the architects Yrjö Lindegren and Toivo Jäntti. The Olympic stadium, known as an icon of functionalist style of architecture, was featured in the Architectural Digest as one of the best examples of Olympic architecture. Yrjö Lindgren later became himself an Olympic medallist when he received the gold medal for architecture at the 1948 Olympics in London.

Construction of the Olympic Stadium began in 1934 and it was completed in 1938, with the intent to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were moved from Tokyo to Helsinki before being cancelled due to World War II. It hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics over a decade later instead. The stadium was also to be the main venue for the cancelled 1943 Workers&#x27; Summer Olympiad.

It was the venue for the first ever Bandy World Championship in 1957.

The stadium was completely modernized in 1990–1994 and also renovated just before the 2005 World Championships in Athletics.

In 2006, an American TV series, &quot;The Amazing Race 10&quot;, had one of its episodes ending at The Olympic Stadium Tower. As a task, teams had to do a face-first rappel (known as the Angel Dive) down the Helsinki Olympic Tower.

Since March 2007, a Eurasian eagle-owl has been spotted living in and around the stadium. On June 6, 2007, during a Euro 2008 qualifying match, the owl delayed play by ten minutes after perching on a goalpost. Due to strict conservation laws, no physical attempt to persuade the bird to leave were allowed. The owl was later christened Bubi and was named as Helsinki&#x27;s Resident of the Year. The Belgians quite unexpectedly lost the match to Finland by 2-0. Afterwards they claimed it was due to the owl who &quot;disturbed their rhythm of playing&quot;. This promoted Bubi owl to something like a Finnish national football hero and from that time on the Finnish men&#x27;s football Team has been called &quot;Huuhkajat&quot; (The Eagle-Owls) . 

The 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Olympic Games hosted in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium was the main motif for one of the first Finnish euro silver commemorative coins, the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Olympic Games commemorative coin, minted in 2002. On the reverse, a view of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium can be seen. On the right, the 500 markka commemorative coin minted in 1952 celebrating the occasion is depicted.

There were plans to host the 2021 Superpesis finals at the Olympic Stadium, but opposition from the clubs about preferring best-of-5 finals instead of a single match, worries about the playing surface (Playing on natural grass and running track surface, in a sport that prefer artificial grass and sand), and scheduling conflicts, led the plan to be called off.

==Features==
The stadium&#x27;s spectator capacity was at its maximum during the 1952 Summer Olympics with over 70,000 spectator places. Nowadays the stadium has 36,251 spectator places. During concerts, depending on the size of the stage, the capacity is 45,000–50,000.

The tower of the stadium, a distinct landmark with a height of , a measurement of the length of the gold-medal win by Matti Järvinen in javelin throw of 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Recent==


Major renovation work at the stadium started in the spring of 2016. During renovation all the spectator stands were covered with canopies and the field area and the tracks were renewed. The stadium now also offers extended restaurant areas and more indoor sport venues. The renovation was completed and the stadium was open to the public in September 2020.

The projected cost of the renovation was expected to consume €197 million in 2016, €261 million in 2019 and ended up at a price of €337 million, which is €140 million (or 70 percent) more than the original projected cost. The Finnish state and the City of Helsinki are the funders of the renovation.

<doc id="1190034" wikidata="Q5146905" url="?curid=1190034" title="College rowing in the United States">
<text>Rowing is the oldest intercollegiate sport in the United States. The first intercollegiate race was a contest between Yale and Harvard in 1852. In the 2018–19 school year, there were 2,340 male and 7,294 female collegiate rowers (on 57 and 148 teams, respectively) in Divisions I, II and III, according to the NCAA. The sport has grown since the first NCAA statistics were compiled for the 1981–82 school year, which reflected 2,053 male and 1,187 female collegiate rowers (on 48 and 43 teams, respectively) in the three divisions. Some concern has been raised that some recent female numbers are inflated by non-competing novices.

Men&#x27;s rowing has organized collegiate championships in various forms since 1871. The Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) has been the de facto national championship for men since 1895. Women&#x27;s rowing initially competed in its intercollegiate championships as part of the National Women&#x27;s Rowing Association Championship in 1971. From 1980 through 1996, the women&#x27;s national championships races were conducted at the National Collegiate Rowing Championships in Cincinnati. In the 1996–97 season, most women&#x27;s intercollegiate rowing programs elected to join the NCAA as a &quot;Championship&quot; sport. Men&#x27;s rowing declined to join the NCAA, but virtually all colleges abide by NCAA regulations. Other governing bodies of college rowing in the United States include the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA).

==History==
===Timeline===

*1852 – Yale challenges Harvard to a rowing race and the first Harvard-Yale Boat Race is held. This is also the first intercollegiate event held in the United States. Since 1864 this race has been held annually and since 1878, with few exceptions, it has been raced on the Thames River in New London, Connecticut.
*1864 – Rowing became the first organized sport at Rutgers. Six-mile races were held on the Raritan River among six-oared boats.
*1870 – The Rowing Association of American Colleges was established by Bowdoin, Brown and Harvard Universities and Massachusetts Agricultural College, now known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The first regatta was held on July 21, 1871, at Ingleside, Massachusetts, on the Connecticut River. This can be considered to be the very first collegiate athletic organization in the country and devised a primary rule of eligibility: that only undergraduate students should be eligible to represent their college in the regatta—a rule which remains in the NCAA to this day.
*1870 – Rutgers held its first intercollegiate competition on the Raritan River against the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the then top-ranked amateur crew of the time. The distance of the course was three miles.
*1872 – Princeton&#x27;s first intercollegiate race, at the National Amateur Regatta, Philadelphia.
*1875 – Wellesley College established the first women&#x27;s rowing program.
*1878 – Columbia wins the Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup and becomes the first foreign crew to win at the Henley Royal Regatta.
*1891 – The Intercollegiate Rowing Association was founded by Cornell, Columbia, and Pennsylvania: its first annual regatta was hosted on June 24, 1895. Today Navy and Syracuse are also members of the association. Cornell dominates the early regattas winning 14 of the first 23 varsity 8 races.
*1903 – The University of Washington established a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing program, and beat the University of California in their first dual.

*1916 – Lightweight rowing was first introduced at the University of Pennsylvania.
*1920 – Navy wins the gold medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in the eight-man (8+) boat. US collegiate boats would win the gold medal in the 8+ at the next seven Olympics.
*1922 – The first Harvard-Yale-Princeton lightweight race is held on May 20.
*1923 – Washington is the first team from the west coast to win the varsity 8 title at the IRA regatta. Between 1920 and 1950, California, Navy and Washington would dominate college rowing winning 21 of the 25 varsity titles at the IRA and five Olympic titles in the eight-man boat.
*1924 – Yale varsity men&#x27;s 8 wins Olympic gold in Paris
*1928 – The University of California varsity men&#x27;s 8 wins the Olympic gold medal in Amsterdam.
*1932 – The University of California varsity men&#x27;s 8 wins its second Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles.
*1936 – Washington varsity men&#x27;s 8 wins gold at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany at the &#x27;Nazi games&#x27;. Their story is later recounted in &quot;The Boys in the Boat&quot;.
*1946 – The Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) is formed and the first Eastern Sprints is held for lightweights and heavyweights.

*1948 – Princeton becomes the first American lightweight crew to win a championship at Henley (the Thames Cup).
*1963 – Harry Parker becomes coach of Harvard.
*1971 – Collegiate women begin competing in the eight-oared boat (8+) at the National Women&#x27;s Rowing Association (NWRA) Championship (collegiate and non-collegiate).
*1972 – Congress passes Title IX, which eventually leads to large growth in women&#x27;s rowing.
*1973 – Radcliffe College women&#x27;s rowing team wins NWRA National Championship.
*1973 – Princeton women&#x27;s eight wins New England Intercollegiate Regatta championship (forerunner to EAWRC Women&#x27;s Eastern Sprints).
*1975 – The University of Wisconsin women&#x27;s rowing team wins NWRA National Championship. 
*1976 – The Yale women&#x27;s rowing team strips in front of the Yale athletic director to demand equal opportunity under Title IX. The incident makes national headlines. The documentary film, &quot;A Hero for Daisy&quot;, memorializes this event.
*1976 – First EAWRC Varsity Women&#x27;s Lightweight 8 championship, won by Boston University,
*1979 – Yale women&#x27;s team claims its first national championship as top college finisher at NWRA regatta.

*2009 – Washington Sweeps the 8+ Events at the IRA Regatta, becoming the first crew to do so since they did in 1997. They won in the Varsity 8, Second Varsity 8, Freshman 8, and open four and placed second in the Varsity 4
*2010 – The University of California Men&#x27;s 8 wins gold at the IRAs, its sixth in 12 years and 16th overall, second only to Cornell&#x27;s 22 titles.
*2011 – Washington&#x27;s men&#x27;s 8 wins gold at the IRAs for the 14th time.
*2012 – Washington&#x27;s men achieve an unprecedented sweep of all five grand finals at the IRAs, setting record times in 2V8, freshmen 8, V4, and open 4, as well as its 15th V8 IRA title.

==Categories==
===Men&#x27;s rowing===
Men&#x27;s rowing is not affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The &quot;de facto&quot; national championship of Division I men&#x27;s rowing is the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) Championships. The National Champion in each category is the winner of its respective Varsity 8+ race. The Dad Vail Regatta is considered the national championship for second-tier schools. These include top club teams such as Virginia and Michigan as well as lower level varsity programs such as Hobart and St. Joseph&#x27;s University. Other club programs and all programs outside the NCAA/IRA structure compete at the ACRA National Championship Regatta.

In collegiate men&#x27;s rowing, the First Varsity 8 is meant to be the fastest boat. Oarsmen not selected for the First Varsity 8 are usually placed in the Second Varsity 8 followed by the Third Varsity. Rowers outside of the top two eights are sometimes, depending on the race, put into fours of various categories. This is the case at the IRA championship, for example, but not at the Eastern Sprints or Pac-10 championship. Freshman separately competed in the Freshman 8, the Second Freshman 8, a Freshman 4, etc., until 2012 when the IRA permitted freshman eligibility to row in a varsity boat; most leagues followed suit. The IRA eliminated freshman races after 2015.

===Women&#x27;s rowing===
NCAA women&#x27;s rowing is divided into three divisions with an official NCAA championship:
*NCAA Division I Rowing Championship
*NCAA Division II Rowing Championship
*NCAA Division III Rowing Championship

Women rowers compete at the NCAA Division I Rowing Championship in a Varsity 8, a Second Varsity 8, and a Varsity Four. Most teams also field one or more Novice Eights for novice rowers who have never competed at the collegiate level. Points are awarded for the overall championship based on the performance of those boats. Other head races and regattas such as Head of the Charles or the Pac-12 Championships allow a wide variety of competition in less-prominent boat classifications such as pair, sculls, and lightweight racing.

There has been spectacular growth in women&#x27;s rowing over the past 25 years. In 1985, the FISA and Olympic course distance for women was increased from 1,000 meters to 2,000 meters (the same distance raced by men), marking progress in public perception of women&#x27;s strength, endurance and competitive drive. Universities that have never had a men&#x27;s team have added women&#x27;s rowing to the athletic department and are providing funding and athletic scholarships for the expensive and demanding sport, contributing to a noticeable increase in the success and competitiveness of many collegiate women&#x27;s rowing teams. This, in part, is to comply with Title IX; many of the football powers use women&#x27;s rowing to help balance out the large number of scholarships awarded to male football players. As a result, many women&#x27;s college rowers have not previously competed at high school or for a club team.

===Lightweight rowing===
When Canadian sculler Joseph Wright began coaching at Penn in 1916, he discovered that he had a number of smaller but excellent oarsmen. His idea of creating a crew composed entirely of these lighter weight rowers—averaging 150 pounds per man—quickly spread to other institutions, and by 1919 the American Rowing Association officially recognized competition in lightweight rowing by 150-pounders in eight-oared shells. The initial weight difference between lightweights and heavyweights of that era—about 20 pounds—was not particularly substantial. In fact, lightweight rowers weights were much closer to the heavyweight crews of that era than they are now. For men, the maximum weight is currently 160 lbs. For women, the weight limit is 130 lbs.

Rowers must propel the weight of their equipment and coxswain as well as their own weight down the race course. The weight of equipment and coxswain is roughly the same for heavyweights and lightweights. As a generalization, the greater the strength, endurance and perseverance of a rower—as compared to the total weight he or she must propel down the course—the greater the speed. In rowing, taller individuals have a leverage advantage, and, as a rule, heavier individuals tend to have more absolute strength to allocate not only to themselves but also to the weight of the equipment and coxswain. A top heavyweight boat will thus be faster than a top lightweight boat, but a top lightweight boat will be faster than many heavyweight boats. For example, the winning lightweight men&#x27;s 8 at the 2015 to 2019 IRAs was faster than the finals time for all but 6 to 12 heavyweights 8s.

There are races for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lightweight rowing. However, many of the smaller colleges have limited sized programs and simply field open weight boats, which include rowers who would qualify as lightweights, and many larger Division I-A universities, cognizant of Title IX issues, have limited the size of their men&#x27;s programs. This is especially apparent in the west, where California Lightweight Crew remains one of the few programs for men&#x27;s lightweight rowing in that region.

However, on the east coast, most Ivy League and EARC schools have well-populated, excellent, fast and well-funded men&#x27;s lightweight teams. The lightweight men&#x27;s events at the Eastern Sprints and the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship (IRAs) are fiercely contested. For example, the time difference between the first and sixth lightweight men&#x27;s varsity 8 at the 2019 IRAs was only 1.7 seconds—less than half a length. Since the NCAA Rowing Championships does not have a lightweight event for women, a select number of these teams (e.g., University of Wisconsin) are eligible to compete at IRAs.

Olympic rowing introduced lightweight event categories for the first time at the 1996 Atlanta Games. As of 2024, Olympic rowing has removed lightweight rowing from further Olympic games in exchange for coastal rowing.

===Freshman/novice rowing===
Since rowing is such a technical sport, there is a separate category for novices (rowers with less than one year of experience). This is usually combined with freshman rowers, who may have rowed before in high school, but are in their first year in collegiate rowing. The Freshman squad is sometimes open only to college freshmen. However, people who start rowing after their freshman year normally join the novice team as well. The novice squad usually fields a freshman eight-oared boat (8+), and if the team is big enough, a second eight, and/or a four-oared boat (4+). In some collegiate conferences excluding the EARC and Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA), collegiate freshmen/novice can also compete as part of the varsity squad. At the 2012 IRA Steward&#x27;s annual meeting it was voted to repeal the ban on freshmen competing as part of their varsity squad. In the league the term &#x27;First Year Collegiate Rower&#x27; will now be used to describe Freshmen/Novice rowing.

==Annual calendar==
Rowing is one of the few collegiate sports where athletes practice year round and compete during both spring and fall. In addition many athletes train at various rowing clubs around the country during the summer.

===Fall===
In the fall, most schools focus on building technical proficiency and improving physical strength and endurance. This is typically accomplished through long steady practice pieces, with occasional shorter interval pieces. In the United States fall is also the season of head races which are typically between three and six kilometers. These longer races are part of the foundation for the spring season, building the rower&#x27;s endurance and mental toughness. The largest fall race is the Head of the Charles Regatta held in Boston each October. This race includes rowers of all ages, abilities, and affiliations and features the best college crews in competition with Olympic-level athletes from the United States and other countries. The largest collegiate-only regatta in the fall is the Princeton Chase, typically in early November on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, and hosted by Princeton University. 

===Winter===
This is an intense building period for the spring racing season. The training regimen consists primarily of long interval training, which gradually becomes shorter and more intense as the race season approaches. This is done on the water for schools below the snowline, where warmer climates allow for outdoor workouts. For some of the northern colleges that practice on lakes and rivers that freeze during winter, these pieces are done indoors using ergometers and, if the college is lucky enough to have them, indoor rowing tanks. Additionally, most schools, regardless of whether they have water to row on, do ergometer testing (all out maximum performance tests), weight lifting, and long cardio workouts. A few colleges and universities send their fastest rowers to the CRASH-B Sprints in Boston. This 2,000 meter race is held on ergometers and features separate events for collegiate athletes. Many northeastern colleges have a winter training trip to a warmer state such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Texas during either winter break or spring break to give students extra time on the water while the local rivers and lakes are frozen.

===Spring===
Spring is the primary season for college rowing and the majority of the schedule is composed of duel races. These 2,000-meter races take place between two or, sometimes, three schools. The winner of these races usually receive shirts from the losing teams.

There are also several large regattas, such as the Dad Vail Regatta, Eastern Sprints, Knecht Cup, and the San Diego Crew Classic which may be on the schedule. In this case, the teams compete in either flights, in which the winner is final, or a series of heats and semifinals before the winners move on to the finals. Sprint races begin with all teams lined up and started simultaneously, as opposed to the time trials in the fall.

Performing well in these races is the most important selection criteria for the various post season invitation rowing championships. If the crew is in a league, the duel race and regatta results will also typically be used in determining the team&#x27;s seeding for the league championship. The Dad Vail Regatta is the largest and most prestigious for smaller schools and is held every May.
The lightweight division becomes more prominent during the spring. Many head races lack separate categories for heavyweight/lightweight, but spring races usually have a separate weight category for lighter rowers.

==National championships==
===Men&#x27;s===
The Intercollegiate Rowing Association, known as the IRA, was founded by Cornell, Columbia, and Penn in 1894 and its first annual regatta was hosted on June 24, 1895. Today Navy and Syracuse are also members of the association. Each year these five schools choose whom to invite to the regatta and are responsible for its organization along with the ECAC. The IRA is the oldest college rowing championship in the United States.

Since the 1920s, when the West Coast crews, notably California and University of Washington began to attend and regularly win, most crews considered the Intercollegiate Rowing Association&#x27;s championship to be a &quot;de facto&quot; national championship. Two important crews, Harvard and Yale, however, did not participate in the heavyweight divisions of the event. After losing to Cornell in 1897, Harvard and Yale chose to avoid the IRA, so as not to diminish the Harvard-Yale race. It soon became part of each school&#x27;s tradition not to go. Beginning in 1973, Washington decided to skip the IRA because a change in schedule conflicted with its finals.

Even though rowing is the oldest intercollegiate sport, the men have always chosen not to join the NCAA. If they did, the NCAA would sponsor a championship, but it would also force the sport to abide by NCAA rules and mandates. Notwithstanding, collegiate crews generally abide by NCAA rules, and they also have to abide by athletic conference rules, which mirror the NCAA rules.

In 1982, a Harvard alumnus decided to remedy this perceived problem by establishing a heavyweight varsity National Collegiate Rowing Championship race in Cincinnati, Ohio. It paid for the winners of the Pac-10 Championship, the Eastern Sprints, the IRA and the Harvard-Yale race to attend. It was a finals only event and other crews could attend if they paid their own way and there was room in the field. The winner received an expense paid trip to the Henley Royal Regatta as a prize. After 1996, however, the race was discontinued.

Given Washington&#x27;s return to the IRA in 1995 and the demise of the National Collegiate Rowing Championship, the IRA again was considered to be the national championship. In 2003, Harvard and Yale, after an absence of over one hundred years, decided to participate.

For men&#x27;s rowing the Dad Vail Regatta in Philadelphia is considered the national championship for smaller college teams unable to compete at the IRA standard (similar to Division III or I-AA in other sports). It is the largest collegiate race in the nation.

Starting in 2008, club crews (non-Varsity programs) were no longer allowed to participate in the IRA Regatta, and the ACRA National Championship Regatta is considered the National Championship for collegiate club programs and all programs outside the NCAA/IRA structure. Unlike most collegiate sports, club-level crews regularly compete against Varsity programs and are often competitive.

==== Qualification ====
As of 2018, qualification for the National Championship Regatta comes from automatic qualifying positions at the three major rowing conference championships, three National Regattas, and at-large bids. The automatic qualification bids are assigned as:

* Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges: Eastern Sprints (&quot;Top Nine Eligible IRA Finishers&quot;)
* Pac-12 Conference: Pac-12 Championships (&quot;Top Three Eligible IRA Finishers&quot;)
* Western Sprints: Western Sprints Championships (&quot;Top Two Eligible IRA Finishers&quot;)
* Southern Intercollegiate Rowing Association: SIRA Regatta (&quot;Top One Eligible IRA Finisher&quot;)
* Dad Vail Regatta: (&quot;Top One Eligible IRA Finisher&quot;)
* National Invitational Rowing Championships: (&quot;Top One Eligible IRA Finisher&quot;)

Typically, there are a total of 24 entries with the above 17 entries granted as automatic qualification bids. The remaining 7 entries are selected by the IRA in the weeks following the conclusion of all qualifying regattas.

The IRA awards the Varsity Challenge Cup to the men&#x27;s heavyweight national championship 8, the 1922 Trophy to the men&#x27;s lightweight national championship 8, and the Camden County Freeholders Trophy to the women&#x27;s lightweight national championship 8. The IRA also awards the Ten Eyck Trophy to the university amassing the largest number of points in three of the four possible eights from each school.

===Women&#x27;s===
Between 1967 and 1980, women&#x27;s collegiate boats entered the National Women&#x27;s Rowing Association National Championships (what is now the USRowing National Championships). The college boats raced against club boats, including boats from outside the United States. The best finishing US collegiate boat was deemed to be the National Champion.

The first women&#x27;s collegiate championship was held in 1980 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This race was open solely to collegiate rowing teams.

In 1982, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) host the championship event.

Since 1997, the NCAA has hosted an invitational rowing championship for women. Unlike the former women&#x27;s collegiate championship, the NCAA does not have a championship race for women&#x27;s lightweight rowing. In response, the IRA hosts a women&#x27;s lightweight event.

The NCAA currently hosts championships for Division I, Division II and Division III colleges, with Divisions II and III having been added in 2002.

NCAA Division I requires colleges to enter two eight-oared shells and one four-oared shell in the team championship. The championship is restricted to 10 conference champions (American, ACC, A-10, Big Ten, Big 12, CAA, Ivy, MAAC, Patriot, and WCC) as automatic qualifiers and 12 at-large schools for a total of 22 teams. The at-large teams are selected by the NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Rowing Committee. The NCAA Division II championship consists of an eight-oared shells and four-oared shell competition. The Division III championship involved both varsity and second varsity eights competing in the same event until 2012. Beginning in 2013, the V-1 and V-2 boats compete in separate events.

== NCAA Conferences (women&#x27;s teams) ==

===Atlantic Coast Conference===
The Atlantic Coast Conference first held a rowing championship in 2000 with Clemson, Duke, North Carolina, and Virginia participating. The 2005 conference realignment cycle brought two rowing schools into the ACC, with Miami and Boston College respectively joining for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Further realignment in the early 2010s brought three more rowing schools into the conference. Notre Dame and Syracuse joined the ACC in 2013, with Louisville joining the following year. California, SMU, and Stanford joined in 2024.

===Atlantic 10 Conference===
The Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) first held a rowing championship in 1996 with 10 schools participating. Today, nine schools participate.

UMass will leave the A-10 after the 2024–25 season to become a full member of the Mid-American Conference, which is starting a rowing league in the 2025–26 season.

Departing members are indicated in pink.
===Big Ten Conference===
The Big Ten Conference hosted its first Big Ten Women&#x27;s Rowing Championship in 2000. Currently seven schools compete in both the Championship Regatta and annual &quot;Double Duals&quot; races consisting of contests between 2–3 Big Ten competitors. The Big Ten is one of the dominant conferences in women&#x27;s collegiate rowing, with at least one school being selected to compete at the NCAA Rowing Championships every year since its inception.

The Big Ten rowing league expanded to eight members in 2014 when Rutgers joined the conference, and to 11 members in 2024 with the arrival of UCLA, USC, and Washington.

===Big 12 Conference===
The early history of Big 12 Conference women&#x27;s rowing is intertwined with the rowing history of Conference USA (CUSA).

The Big 12 contested its first rowing championship in 2008 (2007–08 school year), initially with Kansas, Kansas State, and Texas. Oklahoma joined the following year. In July 2012, West Virginia joined the conference for all sports, bringing the number of rowing schools to five.

In the meantime, CUSA held its first rowing championship in 2010 (2009–10 school year). The Big 12 and CUSA agreed that the four Big 12 schools that then sponsored the sport would also participate in the CUSA championship. These schools were joined by the three full CUSA members that sponsored the sport (SMU, Tulsa, and UCF) and two Southeastern Conference members (Alabama and Tennessee). Alabama did not participate in the 2011 CUSA tournament because of the massive tornado that hit its home city of Tuscaloosa. West Virginia joined the Big 12 in 2012, also joining CUSA women&#x27;s rowing at that time. Also in 2012, Old Dominion moved five of its sports, including women&#x27;s rowing, from the CAA to CUSA in advance of that school&#x27;s 2013 entry into full CUSA membership.

As a result of the 2013 split of the original Big East Conference, SMU and UCF both left CUSA for that league&#x27;s football-sponsoring offshoot, the American Athletic Conference, in 2013, and Tulsa made the same move a year later. CUSA added two new rowing affiliates for the 2013–14 season in Sacramento State and San Diego State, but both left after that season for The American. The rapid turnover in rowing membership presumably led the Big 12 to take over the CUSA women&#x27;s rowing league, with the three remaining CUSA rowing schools (Alabama, Old Dominion, Tennessee) becoming Big 12 affiliates.

Old Dominion left Big 12 rowing after the 2017–18 season for the American Athletic Conference.

Amid the early-2020s realignment, initially triggered by the announcement that charter Big 12 members (and rowing schools) Oklahoma and Texas would leave for the Southeastern Conference (SEC) no later than 2025 (later confirmed for 2024), Old Dominion returned to Big 12 rowing in 2024–25, and Tulsa was added as a new affiliate at the same time. The Big 12&#x27;s announcement of its incoming rowing members hinted at the departure of then-current women&#x27;s rowing associates and full SEC members Alabama and Tennessee, neither of which was included in the list of Big 12 rowing members for 2024–25. SEC bylaws allow it to hold a championship in any sport sponsored by at least 25% of the full membership. The SEC announced the addition of rowing on August 23, 2024 with Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas as its inaugural programs.

===Coastal Athletic Association===
The Coastal Athletic Association, known before 2023 as the Colonial Athletic Association, began official sponsorship of women&#x27;s rowing as the conference&#x27;s 23rd sport in March 2009. Previously, the conference championships were held unofficially as the Kerr Cup, hosted by Drexel University. The first CAA women&#x27;s rowing championship was conducted on April 18, 2009 in Philadelphia with races in the Varsity 4+, Second Varsity 8+, and Varsity 8+. The event was conducted in conjunction with the Kerr Cup on the Schuylkill River along historic Boathouse Row. The most recent championship in May 2024 was held on the Cooper River in Pennsauken, New Jersey. Four full CAA members currently sponsor women&#x27;s rowing at the intercollegiate level—the University of Delaware, Drexel University, Monmouth University, and Northeastern University; they are joined by four associate members in Eastern Michigan University, the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), the University of Connecticut (UConn), and Villanova University.

Delaware and Eastern Michigan will leave CAA rowing after the 2024–25 season. Eastern Michigan&#x27;s full-time home of the Mid-American Conference will establish its own rowing league in 2025–26, with Delaware (which is leaving the CAA for full membership in Conference USA at that time) becoming an associate member.

In the table below, departing schools are indicated in pink. 
=== Ivy League ===
Ivy League women&#x27;s teams:
===Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference===
The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) is a college athletic conference which operates in the northeastern United States. The conference championships are held during the end of April at Cooper River Park in New Jersey.

===Mid-American Conference===
The Mid-American Conference will begin sponsoring rowing in 2025-26.
===Patriot League===
===Southeastern Conference===
The Southeastern Conference began sponsoring rowing in 2024-25.
===West Coast Conference===
The West Coast Conference first held a women&#x27;s rowing championship in 1997 with five of the league&#x27;s eight members at that time participating—Gonzaga, Loyola Marymount, Saint Mary&#x27;s, San Diego, and Santa Clara. Creighton became a WCC associate member starting with the 2011 championship, and longtime WCC member Portland added a varsity rowing team the following season. With the 2024 collapse of the Pac-12 Conference, that conference&#x27;s last two members, Oregon State and Washington State, placed most of their sports (including rowing) in the WCC through 2025–26, after which the Pac-12 will add at least six new members—one being current full WCC member Gonzaga.

===Eastern College Athletic Conference/Metro League===
The ECAC/Metro League is a women&#x27;s rowing conference.

The participating schools are: Buffalo, Colgate, Delaware, Fordham, Mercyhurst, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, UMass Villanova, and West Virginia. Most of these schools have dual conference memberships in rowing.

== Other conferences ==
===Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges===
The Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) was formed in 1946. It is a men&#x27;s rowing conference composed of the Ivy League schools plus other select universities. Each year the EARC schools race at the Eastern Sprints regatta on Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts, which, for the men, is generally considered the most important race of the year aside from the IRA.

The EARC men&#x27;s lightweight team which attains the highest points for the Freshman 8+, Second Varsity 8+ (JV), and First Varsity 8+ are awarded the Jope Cup.

On the women&#x27;s side, the conference is called the Eastern Association of Women&#x27;s Rowing Colleges (EAWRC). The Women&#x27;s Eastern Sprints, held on the Cooper River in Camden, New Jersey, are highly competitive, on a similar level of competitiveness as the Aramark Central Region Championships and Pac-12 Championships.

The Eastern Sprints also serve as the Ivy League Championship, with the best-placed boat from an Ivy League school being crowned Ivy League Champion.

=== Division II Independent ===
All three teams play in their respective Division II conferences, yet have not formed a larger northeast conference sponsoring rowing, hence, these three schools all play in the East Region. Notably, Mercyhurst is a former DII Independent School, and the only DII independent school to have won the DII Rowing Championship (doing so twice). However, the school has transitioned to Division I, leaving only three teams to play within the independent &quot;division&quot;.
===Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference===
Prior to the formation of the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference, the nine charter member schools—Bryn Mawr College, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Johns Hopkins University, Marietta College, the University of Mary Washington, North Park University, Richard Stockton College, Rutgers University–Camden, and Washington College—enjoyed an affiliation due to their annual competition at the Mid-Atlantic Division III Rowing Championships, formerly the Atlantic Collegiate League Sprints Championships. In late 2008, the rowing programs at the nine schools expressed a common desire to formalize their association in order to enhance the student-athlete experience for their rowers. From that desire, the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference was born in January 2009 and the Mid-Atlantic Division III Rowing Championships became the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference Championships.

=== Mountain Pacific Sports Federation ===
The Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a multi-sports conference created to provide competitive opportunities in non-revenue sports, began sponsoring men&#x27;s rowing in 2024–25 with eight NCAA Division I members.

===New England Small College Athletic Conference===
The New England Small Collegiate Athletic Conference (NESCAC) is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eleven highly selective liberal arts institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The NESCAC Division III Rowing Teams use the National Invitational Rowing Championships as their conference championship.

===Great Northwest Athletic Conference===
The Great Northwest Athletic Conference consists of four schools. Though only having two primary members (Seattle Pacific and Western Washington), they have welcomed both Cal Poly Humboldt and the University of Central Oklahoma as affiliate members. The championship is typically held two weeks prior to the DII Rowing Championship. This division is considered a power conference within Division II rowing as the division has been responsible for 15 of the 22 awarded national champions (though many championships occurred during membership in the NCRC). Notably, Seattle Pacific is the only school currently in the conference to have not won the DII rowing championship, their best finish being runner-up in 2010 to rival Western Washington.
===Sunshine State Conference===
The Sunshine State Conference consists of six NCAA Division II member schools in USRowing&#x27;s Southeast region. The Conference hosts two major regattas each year. The SSC double duals takes place during late-March with the venue rotating between member schools hosting, and has welcomed non-conference members from the south. Conference championships are annually held the third weekend of April at the Nathan Benderson Park on Nathan Benderson Park, Florida. Notably, Florida Tech cut both men and women&#x27;s rowing without warning to the athletes. However, the men&#x27;s team was subsequently reinstated following a court case won by the male students, claiming less sports were available to them despite there being a higher male population on campus, violating Title IX. The conference has had a team win the national championship three times.
===Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association===
The Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association (WIRA) is an American collegiate conference that sponsors men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing.

==Olympic medals won by U.S. collegiate boats==
Up until the 1968 Summer Olympics, the United States had a trial system to pick the boats that would represent the United States in the Olympics. The top boats in the country, both collegiate and club, would participate in the Olympic Trials after the end of the collegiate calendar.

With the exception of 1964, a college boat won every Olympics Trials in the eight-oared boat (8+) from 1920 through 1968—and all of the boats from 1920 through 1956 won gold medals. College boats also have had some success in the four-man events (4+) and (4-) and the pair (2-).

Beginning in 1972, the United States has chosen its eight from a national selection camp. Numerous college athletes have made Olympic boats, but they were not specifically representing their University either at the camp, or at the Olympic trials for some of the smaller boats.

Below is a list of college boats that represented the United States at the Olympics:

===Eight (8+)===
==== Olympic gold medals ====
* 1920 Summer Olympics Brussels—United States Naval Academy

<doc id="1190047" wikidata="Q542789" url="?curid=1190047" title="Lecy Goranson">
<text>Alicia Linda &quot;Lecy&quot; Goranson (; born June 22, 1974) is an American actress. She plays Becky Conner in the television sitcoms &quot;Roseanne&quot;, which debuted in 1988, and &quot;The Conners&quot;. She has also had supporting roles in the films &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1996), &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Extra Man&quot; (2010).

==Career==
=== &quot;Roseanne&quot; ===
Goranson studied acting in Chicago and subsequently landed the role of Becky Conner. It was only the second time she had ever auditioned for any part. She played the character for five seasons, exiting the series in 1992, several episodes into the fifth season, to attend Vassar College. Her academic schedule allowed her to continue appearing part-time as Becky. Under her new arrangement, the show&#x27;s producers and writers wrote scenes for Becky sparingly. Goranson&#x27;s exit resulted in Becky&#x27;s eloping with her boyfriend Mark.

During the following season, the producers wanted to bring back the character. Goranson was still unavailable, so Sarah Chalke auditioned and won the role.

Chalke played Becky for the remainder of the sixth season and all of the seventh season. When the show reached its eighth season, Goranson was able to play Becky again while still attending college, replacing Chalke. Goranson appeared in the show&#x27;s eighth season, but by mid-season she had scheduling conflicts with school again. On two occasions Goranson had to pull out of episodes in which the Becky character was necessary: Darlene&#x27;s wedding and a family trip to Walt Disney World. Chalke played Becky for these episodes. Toward the season&#x27;s end, Goranson returned to play Becky. When the series was renewed for a ninth season, Goranson, who was still in school, declined to continue in the role in order not to cause scheduling conflicts. Chalke returned for the ninth season, which was her last appearance in that role. Chalke did appear in season 10 as the new character Andrea who attempts to enlist Becky as a surrogate mother.

The appearances by Goranson vs. Chalke became a running gag. Goranson&#x27;s first re-appearance was marked with a, &quot;Where the hell have you been?&quot; comment from several cast members while in character. Similarly, Chalke&#x27;s sporadic appearances during Season 8 would be played for humor with an, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you glad you&#x27;re here this week?&quot; remark from Roseanne. There was even a glimpse into the future where a grown-up and somewhat catatonic DJ, played by John Goodman instead of Michael Fishman, repeatedly uttered to a psychiatrist (referring to Becky), &quot;They say she&#x27;s the same, but she isn&#x27;t the same&quot;. One episode ended with both Beckys performing a parody of the opening theme of &quot;the Patty Duke Show&quot;, with similar music and lyrics to the &quot;identical cousins song&quot;, and an appearance by William Schallert, who played the father on that show.

=== Post-&quot;Roseanne&quot; ===

After the initial run of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Goranson had several small roles in films and has guest starred in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Damages&quot; and &quot;Fringe&quot;. In her post-&quot;Roseanne&quot; film roles, she is normally credited as Alicia rather than Lecy Goranson. She played the part of Sandra in &quot;The Extra Man&quot; which opened in limited release on July 30, 2010.

=== &quot;Roseanne&quot; revival and &quot;The Conners&quot; ===
On April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of &quot;Roseanne&quot; was in the works with most of the original cast and some of the original producers slated to return. In May 2017, it was confirmed that Goranson would be returning in the role of Becky. Chalke would also appear, playing a different role. The revival of &quot;Roseanne&quot; premiered on March 27, 2018, on ABC. On May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Roseanne Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor of former president Barack Obama), ABC cancelled the revival after a single season.

On June 21, 2018, ABC announced a spin-off from &quot;Roseanne&quot;, entitled &quot;The Conners&quot;, with all the original cast of &quot;Roseanne&quot; to return, except for Barr herself. The new show premiered on October 16, 2018.

Goranson wrote season four&#x27;s fourteenth episode, &quot;Triggered&quot;, focusing on gun violence in the United States.

==Personal life==
Goranson was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Stephen Goranson, who worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, and Linda Goranson, who taught English at Evanston Township High School. She has an older brother named Adam. Her mother died in January 2020.

<text>Mail Dominance is the seventh studio album by the American rapper Esham, released in 1999.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic wrote that &quot;Unfortunately, on Mail Dominance it&#x27;s not his delivery or flow that seems questionable but rather his lyrics and the production. When not rapping about nihilistic themes, Esham struggles to find engaging lyrics; here he&#x27;s best when he raps indecipherably.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; thought that &quot;it’s intermittently irritating or annoying—the production is mega-chintzy, and boy does he hate women (hook of &#x27;Ozonelayer&#x27;: &#x27;You bitch/you bitch/you bitch you bitch you bitch you bitch you bitch&#x27;)—but it doesn’t get anywhere near boring, or overfamiliar.&quot; The &quot;Windsor Star&quot; opined that the album &quot;provides more musical variety than most radio stations, with rap, dance, rock and even corny &#x27;50s- sitcom-influenced tracks.&quot; Miguel Burke of &quot;The Source&quot; praised Esham&#x27;s &quot;tight flow&quot;, but was dissatisfied with the lyrical content of the album and &quot;strange production&quot;, with some of the tracks reminding him the soundtracks of &quot;cheesy futuristic flicks from &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s like &quot;Rollerball&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot;&quot;.

OTPs avoid several shortcomings that are associated with traditional (static) password-based authentication; a number of implementations also incorporate two-factor authentication by ensuring that the one-time password requires access to &quot;something a person has&quot; (such as a small keyring fob device with the OTP calculator built into it, or a smartcard or specific cellphone) as well as &quot;something a person knows&quot; (such as a PIN).

OTP generation algorithms typically make use of pseudorandomness or randomness to generate a shared key or seed, and cryptographic hash functions, which can be used to derive a value but are hard to reverse and therefore difficult for an attacker to obtain the data that was used for the hash. This is necessary because otherwise, it would be easy to predict future OTPs by observing previous ones.

OTPs have been discussed as a possible replacement for, as well as an enhancer to, traditional passwords. On the downside, OTPs can be intercepted or rerouted, and hard tokens can get lost, damaged, or stolen. Many systems that use OTPs do not securely implement them, and attackers can still learn the password through phishing attacks to impersonate the authorized user.

== Characteristics ==
The most important advantage addressed by OTPs is that, in contrast to static passwords, they are not vulnerable to replay attacks. This means that a potential intruder who manages to record an OTP that was already used to log into a service or to conduct a transaction will not be able to use it, since it will no longer be valid. A second major advantage is that a user who uses the same (or similar) password for multiple systems, is not made vulnerable on all of them, if the password for one of these is gained by an attacker. A number of OTP systems also aim to ensure that a session cannot easily be intercepted or impersonated without knowledge of unpredictable data created during the &quot;previous&quot; session, thus reducing the attack surface further.

There are also different ways to make the user aware of the next OTP to use. Some systems use special electronic security tokens that the user carries and that generate OTPs and show them using a small display. Other systems consist of software that runs on the user&#x27;s mobile phone. Yet other systems generate OTPs on the server-side and send them to the user using an out-of-band channel such as SMS messaging. Finally, in some systems, OTPs are printed on paper that the user is required to carry.

In some mathematical algorithm schemes, it is possible for the user to provide the server with a static key for use as an encryption key, by only sending a one-time password.

== Generation ==

Concrete OTP algorithms vary greatly in their details. Various approaches for the generation of OTPs include:

* Based on time-synchronization between the authentication server and the client providing the password (OTPs are valid only for a short period of time)
* Using a mathematical algorithm to generate a new password based on the previous password (OTPs are effectively a chain and must be used in a predefined order).
* Using a mathematical algorithm where the new password is based on a challenge (e.g., a random number chosen by the authentication server or transaction details) and/or a counter.

=== Time-synchronized ===

A time-synchronized OTP is usually related to a piece of hardware called a security token (e.g., each user is given a personal token that generates a one-time password). It might look like a small calculator or a keychain charm, with an LCD that shows a number that changes occasionally. Inside the token is an accurate clock that has been synchronized with the clock on the authentication server. In these OTP systems, time is an important part of the password algorithm, since the generation of new passwords is based on the current time rather than, or in addition to, the previous password or a secret key. This token may be a proprietary device, or a mobile phone or similar mobile device which runs software that is proprietary, freeware, or open-source. An example of a time-synchronized OTP standard is time-based one-time password (TOTP). Some applications can be used to keep time-synchronized OTP, like Google Authenticator or a password manager.

=== Hash chains ===
Each new OTP may be created from the past OTPs used. An example of this type of algorithm, credited to Leslie Lamport, uses a one-way function (call it formula_1). This one-time password system works as follows:

# A seed (starting value) formula_2 is chosen. 
# A hash function formula_3 is applied repeatedly (for example, 1000 times) to the seed, giving a value of: formula_4. This value, which we will call formula_5 is stored on the target system.
# The user&#x27;s first login uses a password formula_6 derived by applying formula_1 999 times to the seed, that is, formula_8. The target system can authenticate that this is the correct password, because formula_9 is formula_5, which is the value stored. The value stored is then replaced by formula_6 and the user is allowed to log in.
# The next login, must be accompanied by formula_12. Again, this can be validated because hashing it gives formula_8 which is formula_6, the value stored after the previous login. Again, the new value replaces formula_6 and the user is authenticated. 
# This can be repeated another 997 times, each time the password will be formula_1 applied one fewer time, and is validated by checking that when hashed, it gives the value stored during the previous login. Hash functions are designed to be extremely hard to reverse, therefore an attacker would need to know the initial seed formula_2 to calculate the possible passwords, while the computer system can confirm the password on any given occasion is valid by checking that, when hashed, it gives the value previously used for login. If an indefinite series of passwords is wanted, a new seed value can be chosen after the set for formula_2 is exhausted.
# Although the server&#x27;s counter value is only incremented after a successful OTP authentication, the counter on the token is incremented every time a new password is requested by the user. Because of this, the counter values on the server and on the token might be out of synchronization. It is recommended to set a look-ahead parameter formula_19 on the server, which defines the size of the look-ahead window. In case of an accidental password generation by the user, the server will still authenticate the client, because it can recalculate the next formula_19 OTP-server values, and check them against the received password from the client.

To get the next password in the series from the previous passwords, one needs to find a way of calculating the inverse function formula_21. Since formula_1 was chosen to be one-way, this is extremely difficult to do. If formula_1 is a cryptographic hash function, which is generally the case, it is assumed to be a computationally intractable task. An intruder who happens to see a one-time password may have access for one time period or login, but it becomes useless once that period expires. The S/KEY one-time password system and its derivative OTP are based on Lamport&#x27;s scheme.

=== Challenge–response ===
The use of challenge–response one-time passwords requires a user to provide a response to a challenge. For example, this can be done by inputting the value that the token has generated into the token itself. To avoid duplicates, an additional counter is usually involved, so if one happens to get the same challenge twice, this still results in different one-time passwords. However, the computation does not usually involve the previous one-time password; that is, usually, this or another algorithm is used, rather than using both algorithms.

== Implementations ==

=== SMS ===

A common technology used for the delivery of OTPs is text messaging. Because text messaging is a ubiquitous communication channel, being directly available in nearly all mobile handsets and, through text-to-speech conversion, to any mobile or landline telephone, text messaging has a great potential to reach all consumers with a low total cost to implement. OTP over text messaging may be encrypted using an A5/x standard, which several hacking groups report can be successfully decrypted within minutes or seconds. Additionally, security flaws in the SS7 routing protocol can and have been used to redirect the associated text messages to attackers; in 2017, several O2 customers in Germany were breached in this manner in order to gain access to their mobile banking accounts. In July 2016, the U.S. NIST issued a draft of a special publication with guidance on authentication practices, which discourages the use of SMS as a method of implementing out-of-band two-factor authentication, due to the ability for SMS to be intercepted at scale. Text messages are also vulnerable to SIM swap scams—in which an attacker fraudulently transfers a victim&#x27;s phone number to their own SIM card, which can then be used to gain access to messages being sent to it.

=== Hardware tokens ===
RSA Security&#x27;s SecurID is one example of a time-synchronization type of token, along with HID Global&#x27;s solutions. Like all tokens, these may be lost, damaged, or stolen; additionally, there is an inconvenience as batteries die, especially for tokens without a recharging facility or with a non-replaceable battery. A variant of the proprietary token was proposed by RSA in 2006 and was described as &quot;ubiquitous authentication&quot;, in which RSA would partner with manufacturers to add physical SecurID chips to devices such as mobile phones.

Recently, it has become possible to take the electronic components associated with regular keyfob OTP tokens and embed them in a credit card form factor. However, the thinness of the cards, at 0.79mm to 0.84mm thick, prevents standard components or batteries from being used. Special polymer-based batteries must be used which have a much lower battery life than coin (button) cells. Semiconductor components must not only be very flat but must minimise the power used in standby and when operating. 

Yubico offers a small USB token with an embedded chip that creates an OTP when a key is pressed and simulates a keyboard to facilitate easily entering a long password. Since it is a USB device it avoids the inconvenience of battery replacement.

A new version of this technology has been developed that embeds a keypad into a payment card of standard size and thickness. The card has an embedded keypad, display, microprocessor and proximity chip.

=== Soft tokens ===

On smartphones, one-time passwords can also be delivered directly through mobile apps, including dedicated authentication apps such as Authy and Google Authenticator, or within a service&#x27;s existing app, such as in the case of Steam. These systems do not share the same security vulnerabilities as SMS, and do not necessarily require a connection to a mobile network to use.

=== Hard copies ===
In some countries&#x27; online banking, the bank sends to the user a numbered list of OTPs that is printed on paper. Other banks send plastic cards with actual OTPs obscured by a layer that the user has to scratch off to reveal a numbered OTP. For every online transaction, the user is required to enter a specific OTP from that list. Some systems ask for the numbered OTPs sequentially, others pseudorandomly choose an OTP to be entered.

== Security ==

When correctly implemented, OTPs are no longer useful to an attacker within a short time of their initial use. This differs from passwords, which may remain useful to attackers years after the fact.

As with passwords, OTPs are vulnerable to social engineering attacks in which phishers steal OTPs by tricking customers into providing them with their OTPs. Also like passwords, OTPs can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, making it important to communicate them via a secure channel, for example Transport Layer Security.

The fact that both passwords and OTP are vulnerable to similar kinds of attacks was a key motivation for Universal 2nd Factor, which is designed to be more resistant to phishing attacks.

OTPs which don&#x27;t involve a time-synchronization or challenge–response component will necessarily have a longer window of vulnerability if compromised before their use. In late 2005 customers of a Swedish bank were tricked into giving up their pre-supplied one-time passwords. In 2006 this type of attack was used on customers of a US bank.

== Standardization ==
Many OTP technologies are patented. This makes standardization in this area more difficult, as each company tries to push its own technology. Standards do, however, exist – for example, RFC 1760 (S/KEY), RFC 2289 (OTP), RFC 4226 (HOTP) and RFC 6238 (TOTP).

==Use==
=== Mobile phone ===

A mobile phone itself can be a hand-held authentication token. Mobile text messaging is one of the ways of receiving an OTAC through a mobile phone. In this way, a service provider sends a text message that includes an OTAC enciphered by a digital certificate to a user for authentication. According to a report, mobile text messaging provides high security when it uses public key infrastructure (PKI) to provide bidirectional authentication and non-repudiation, in accordance with theoretical analysis.

SMS as a method of receiving OTACs is broadly used in our daily lives for purposes such as banking, credit/debit cards, and security.

=== Telephone ===

There are two methods of using a telephone to verify a user’s authentication.

With the first method, a service provider shows an OTAC on the computer or smartphone screen and then makes an automatic telephone call to a number that has already been authenticated. Then the user enters the OTAC that appears on their screen into the telephone keypad.

With the second method, which is used to authenticate and activate Microsoft Windows, the user call a number that is provided by the service provider and enters the OTAC that the phone system gives the user.

=== Computer ===

In the field of computer technology, it is known that using one-time authorization code (OTAC) through email, in a broad sense, and using one-time authorization code (OTAC) through web-application, in a professional sense.

* An email is one of the common ways of using OTACs. There are two main methods used. With the first method, a service provider sends a personalised one time URL to an authenticated email address e.g. @ucl.ac.uk; when the user clicks the URL, the server authenticates the user. With the second method, a service provider sends a personalised OTAC (e.g. an enciphered token) to an authenticated email address; when the user types the OTAC into the website, the server authenticates the user.
* A web application can generate a unique personal identification number (PIN) that the user can input into the desktop client, the desktop client, in turn, uses that code to authenticate itself to the web application. This form of authentication is particularly useful in web applications that do not have an internal username/password store but instead use SAML for authentication. Since SAML only works within the browser, a desktop-based web application client cannot successfully authenticate using SAML. Instead, the client application can use the one-time authorization code (OTAC) to authenticate itself to the web application. In addition, it is possible to use the OAuth authorization framework when a third party application needs to obtain limited access to an HTTP service.

=== Post ===
It is possible to send OTACs to a user via post or registered mail. When a user requests an OTAC, the service provider sends it via post or registered mail and then the user can use it for authentication. For example, in the UK, some banks send their OTAC for Internet banking authorization via post or registered mail.

== Expansion ==
Quantum cryptography, which is based on the uncertainty principle is one of the ideal methods to produce an OTAC.

Moreover, it has been discussed and used not only using an enciphered code for authentication but also using graphical one time PIN authentication such as QR code which provides decentralized access control technique with anonymous authentication.

<doc id="1190091" wikidata="Q1945108" url="?curid=1190091" title="Repentance (Esham album)">
<text>Repentance is the ninth studio album by Esham. Released in 2003, it is his first album of new material to be released on Psychopathic Records, and his second album on the label overall, after the compilation &quot;Acid Rain&quot;.

==Lyrics and music==
Because much of Smith&#x27;s most well-known material had contained lyrics that were Satanic in nature, he had long been accused of Satanism and had long attempted to shed such perceptions. &quot;Repentance&quot; was produced as an attempt to &quot;set the [...] record straight&quot; and leave his former &quot;Unholy&quot; stage persona behind him. The album was originally announced under the title &quot;Redemption&quot;.

The song &quot;Woo Woo Woo Woo&quot; was released as a single, and a music video for the song was filmed by Roy Knyrim. In both instances, the song is identified as &quot;Woo Woo Woo&quot;, even though it is referred to as &quot;Woo Woo Woo Woo&quot; on the album itself, and in the chorus. Although the video aired in rotation on BET and MTV 2, Esham decided to direct his own music videos because he disliked the way this video turned out.

==Reception==
&quot;Repentance&quot; peaked at #9 on the Top Heatseekers chart, #10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #71 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In his review of the album, Allrovi&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;&quot;Repentance&quot; is a small step forward for Esham. He seems very confident here, comfortable with himself as an artist&quot; and that &quot;when he pulls everything together [...] he makes some of the best music of his long, fruitful, yet largely unacknowledged career.&quot;

(All songs written by Esham except tracks 6, 8 and 14, which were written by Puwal)
