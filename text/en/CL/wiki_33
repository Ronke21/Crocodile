<text>Pete Jolly (born Peter A. Ceragioli Jr., June 5, 1932 – November 6, 2004) was a two-time Grammy-nominated American West Coast jazz pianist and accordionist. He is known for his performance of television themes and movie soundtracks.

==Biography==
Jolly began playing the accordion at age three and appeared on the radio program &quot;Hobby Lobby&quot; at the age of seven. He was raised in Phoenix, Arizona, a hotbed of jazz at the time. One of his best friends and collaborators in Phoenix was guitarist Howard Roberts, whom he met at the age of 13. Following Roberts to Los Angeles in 1952, he immediately began working with the best players on the West Coast jazz scene, including Shorty Rogers. He moved easily into studio and session work. Besides his performances as a pianist, he also played the accordion.

His composition &quot;Little Bird&quot; (a minor hit on Fred Astaire&#x27;s Ava Records) was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1963, and he formed the Pete Jolly Trio in 1964. With the Trio and as a solo artist, he recorded several albums, including earning a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance – Small Group or Soloist with Small Group. One of the last albums was a collaboration—aptly entitled &quot;Collaboration&quot;—with Jan Lundgren, Chuck Berghofer, and Joe LaBarbera in 2000. His final album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Cool Heat&quot;, was recorded in Phoenix in May 2004 shortly before his death. He worked with Buddy DeFranco, Art Pepper, and Red Norvo, and for many years with music arranger and director Ray Conniff and Herb Alpert, recording on Alpert&#x27;s record label, A&amp;M as both sideman and leader.

Jolly&#x27;s music can be heard on television programs such as &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;, as well as hundreds of movie soundtracks. He recreated some of Bud Powell&#x27;s playing with Charlie Parker for Clint Eastwood&#x27;s biographical movie about Parker, &quot;Bird&quot;. By day, Jolly worked in the studios; by night, with his trio. He continued to perform with his trio in Los Angeles jazz clubs until shortly before being hospitalized in August 2004. His final public performance with his trio was in Reno, Nevada. Jolly died at the age of 72 in November 2004 in Pasadena, California, from complications of multiple myeloma. He is buried at San Gabriel Cemetery in San Gabriel, California.

== Reception ==
The Pete Jolly Trio had only one bassist, Chuck Berghofer, and one drummer, Nick Martinis. Berghofer later said, &quot;In all that time, Pete never once told me how to play or what to play.&quot;

<text>Brávellir (Old Norse) or Bråvalla (modern Swedish) () was the name of the central plain of Östergötland (East Götaland), in Norse mythology.

It appears in several traditions, such as those of the Battle of Bråvalla (Battle of the Bravellir), and in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, where Sinfjötli resides on this plain. Stanza 42:
Its location has been contested because a local tradition places the Battle of Bråvalla at lake Åsnen in the Swedish province of Småland. In the oldest sources, however, such as the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; it is described as (i.e. Bråvalla in Östergötland) and in &quot; Sögubrot af Nokkrum&quot; the battle is said to have taken place south of Kolmården which separated Sweden from Östergötland and where Bråviken is located: 

In the legend of Blenda, the army of women assembled on the Brávellir.

<text>Mieczysław Fogg (born Mieczysław Fogiel; 30 May 1901, Warsaw3 September 1990, Warsaw) was a Polish singer and artist. His popularity started well before World War II and continued well into the 1980s. He had a characteristic way of staying very serious yet slightly emotional on stage when singing. Fogg had a lyric baritone voice and can be compared to French Tino Rossi in style.

==Biography==

Mieczysław Fogiel was born 30 May 1901 in Warsaw, then a province gubernia capital in Russian Empire. His father was Antoni Fogiel (1874–1924), an engine driver, mother was Anna Apolonia Fogiel née Beck (1877–1967), a shopkeeper, he had six siblings. He spent his childhood there and, after graduating from a local gymnasium in 1922, he started working as a railway worker. About that time, he also joined the choir of the St. Anne&#x27;s Church. There his friend, Ludwik Sempoliński, made him join the classes of music organized by Jan Łysakowski, Eugeniusz Mossakowski, Wacław Brzeziński, Ignacy Dygas and many other notable Polish musicians of the epoch. Initially a hobbyist, in 1928 he met Władysław Daniłowski &quot;Dan&quot;, who chose him as a soloist for his newly formed Dan&#x27;s Choir. The choir became extremely popular the following year when Jerzy Petersburski&#x27;s song &quot;Tango Milonga&quot; became an international hit. This and other tangos and romances performed by the choir in the famous Qui pro Quo theatre led Fogiel to become one of the most popular Polish singers. After 1932, Fogiel, under a new pseudonym of &quot;Fogg&quot;, toured a number of countries, including Germany, Latvia, the Soviet Union, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Italy. In the United States, the group toured over 31 states.

His popularity was increased by the fact that Fogg was keen on languages and was able to sing in local languages of the countries he toured. He also appeared in a number of duos with other popular artists of the time, including Hanka Ordonówna, Stefcia Górska, Zula Pogorzelska and Adolf Dymsza. He also appeared in 11 films. After the Dana Choir was disbanded in 1938, Fogg started a solo career. The same year, he was chosen as the most popular Polish singer by the Polish Radio. He toured the country with a trio consisting of himself, Mira Zimińska and Tadeusz Sygietyński. Among the authors of his songs was also Marian Hemar.

After the outbreak of World War II, Fogg remained in Warsaw, where he joined the underground Armia Krajowa. He gave concerts in the few cafes available to Poles under German occupation. During the Warsaw Uprising, he gave countless concerts both on the barricades, in hospitals and in the bomb shelters beneath the city. For his efforts to keep high the morale of the soldiers and civilians of the fighting city, he was awarded with some of the highest Polish decorations. Fogg was also one of the Polish Righteous among the Nations. He hid a Jewish family of Ivo Wesby in his apartment until the end of World War II.

After the war, in 1945, he opened up his own cafe in the ruins of Warsaw. The cafe, located at 119 Marszałkowska Street, was the first music theatre opened after the war in the destroyed city and served as one of the very few centres of culture. However, the following year, it was nationalized by the new communist authorities of Poland and closed soon afterwards. Fogg continued to give hundreds of concerts in all parts of Poland and also headed his private music record firm &quot;Fogg Records&quot;, which shared the fate of Fogg&#x27;s cafe in 1951. His popularity as a singer remained high and in 1958 he was again chosen the most popular Polish singer by the audience of the Polish Radio – 20 years after he was given the same title for the first time.
He continued to give concerts almost until his death in 1990. Throughout his 60-year long career, he gave more than 16,000 of them in all countries of Europe, Brasil, Israel, Ceylon, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US. His everlasting popularity led to the creation of a number of anecdotes. In one of them, the Polish archaeologists supposedly discovered an Egyptian mummy. After they unfolded it, they were surprised by the mummy asking a short question: &quot;Is Fogg still giving concerts?&quot;

Mieczysław Fogg died in Warsaw on 3 September 1990 and is buried at the Bródno Cemetery, Warsaw with his wife and son.

<text>Henry William Herbert (7 April 1807 – 17 May 1858), pen name Frank Forester, was an English-born American novelist, poet, historian, illustrator, journalist and writer on sport. Starr writes that &quot;as a classical scholar he had few equals in the United States . . . his knowledge of English history and literature was extensive; he was a pen-and-ink artist of marked ability; as a sportsman he was unsurpassed; his pupils idolized him.&quot;

==Biography==
The eldest son of William Herbert, Dean of Manchester (himself the son of Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Carnarvon), Herbert was born in London.

Herbert was educated at Eton College and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1830. Having lost his property through a dishonest agent, he emigrated to the United States in 1831 and for the following eight years taught Latin and Greek at a private school in New York City. In 1833 he started the &quot;American Monthly Magazine&quot;, which he edited, in conjunction with A. D. Patterson, until 1835 when he withdrew as a result of disagreements with his associate, Charles Fenno Hoffman. His vanity and arrogance due to his ancestry, his father being the son of the Earl of Carnarvon and his mother, the Hon. Letitia Emily Dorothea Allen, a daughter of Viscount Allen, did not win him many friends. Edgar Allan Poe felt that he was &quot;not unapt to fall into pompous grandiloquence&quot; and sometimes was &quot;woefully turgid&quot;, while others saw his novels as &quot;prolix, lacking in imagination and humor.&quot;

Herbert was a man of varied accomplishments, translating many of the novels of Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père into English. He is listed as a contributor to the first edition of &quot;The New American Cyclopedia&quot; by way of writing articles on Archery, Armour, Austerlitz, Balaklava, St. Bartholomew Massacre, Carthage, Charles I &amp; II of England, Charles XII of Sweden etc.

In 1839 Herbert married Sarah Barker, of Bangor, Maine. They had one son, William George, and one daughter, Louisa. Sarah died 11 March 1844 and was buried in Newark, New Jersey. Their daughter, Louisa, died on 19 August of the same year. William George, their son, was sent to school in England and remained there. Fifteen years later Herbert married Adela Budlong, who filed for divorce after three months.

Herbert was staying at the Stevens Hotel in Manhattan, New York City and invited several men to dine with him on what would be the last night of his life. Only one gentleman accepted his invention, Philip Hone Anthon, a pupil of Herbert&#x27;s, who accepted the invitation because, as he testified at the inquest, Herbert &quot;had complained of feeling very lonely because his wife had left him&quot;. After this he begged Anthon to spend as much time as possible with him. While talking with Anthon, Herbert dashed into his bedroom and shot himself. He killed himself on 17 May 1858 at 2:00 am.

==Publications==
In 1834 Herbert published his first novel, &quot;The Brothers: a Tale of the Fronde&quot;, which was followed by a number of others that achieved popularity including:
* &quot;The Village Inn; or the Adventures of Bellechassaigne&quot; (1843)
* &quot;Marmaduke Wyvil; or The Maid&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1843)
* &quot;The Lord Of The Manor; or, Rose Castleton&#x27;s Temptation: An Old English Story&quot; (1844)
* &quot;Guarica, the Charib Bride: A Legend of Hispaniola&quot; (1844)
* &quot;The Warwick Woodlands; or Things as They Were There&quot; (1845)
* &quot;The Roman Traitor; or the Days of Cicero, Cato and Cataline [&quot;sic&quot;], A True Tale of The Republic&quot; (1846)
* &quot;The Deerstalkers; or, Circumstantial Evidence: A Tale of the South-Western Counties&quot; (1849)
*&quot;The Fair Puritan. An historical romance of the Days of Witchcraft&quot;

Herbert also wrote a series of historical studies, including:
* &quot;Cromwell: An Historical Novel&quot; (1838)
* &quot;Dermot O&#x27;Brien, or, The taking of Tredagh : a tale of 1649&quot; (1849)
* &quot;The Captains of the Old World; as Compared with the Great Modern Strategists&quot; (1851)
* &quot;The Cavaliers of England&quot; (1852)
* &quot;The Knights of England, France and Scotland&quot; (1852)
* &quot;The Chevaliers of France&quot; (1853)
* &quot;Memoirs Of Henry The Eighth Of England With The Fortunes And Characters Of His Six Wives&quot; (1855)

Herbert also translated Aeschylus:

&quot;The Prometheus and Agamemnon of Aeschylus&quot; (1849)

Herbert contributed to one of the early sporting magazines in the United States, the &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, and was well known for his works on sport, published under the pseudonym of Frank Forester. These include:

*&quot;The Field Sports of the United States and British Provinces&quot; (1849)
*&quot;Frank Forester and his Friends&quot; (1849)
*&quot;The Fish and Fishing of the United States&quot; (1850)
*&quot;The Young Sportsman&#x27;s Complete Manual&quot; (1852)
*&quot;The Horse and Horsemanship in the United States and British Provinces of North America&quot; (1858)

<text>Clapsticks, also spelt clap sticks and also known as &#x27;, &#x27;, clappers, musicstick or just stick, are a traditional Australian Aboriginal instrument. They serve to maintain rhythm in voice chants, often as part of an Aboriginal ceremony.

They are a type of drumstick, percussion mallet or claves that belongs to the idiophone category.
Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another.

==Origin and nomenclature==
In northern Australia, clapsticks would traditionally accompany the didgeridoo, and are called or by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia.

== Boomerang clapsticks ==
Boomerang clapsticks are similar to regular clapsticks but they can be shaken for a rattling sound or be clapped together.

== Technique ==
The usual technique employed when using clapsticks is to clap the sticks together to create a rhythm that goes along with the song.

=== Spa and therapy ===
The German word &quot;Bad&quot; means &quot;spa&quot;, reflecting the town&#x27;s history as a health resort. The local &quot;Heilstollen&quot; (literally &#x27;healing tunnel&#x27;) thermal spring water earned the town its early fame. Theophrastus Parcelsus (1493–1541) had studied the spring water to discover its secrets.

In the 16th century the Gastein Hot Springs, known as the &quot;Wildbad&quot;, started to become a popular spa destination. In the 18th century the Salzburg archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo reignited the fashion for visiting the Gastein Hot Springs. He had a classicist palace built in Bad Gastein at which he resided during his summer spa stays. In 1807 the palace was restored as public health resort. This exclusive resort was promoted by Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He had a coach service built between Salzburg and Bad Gastein. In 1807 Bad Gastein was visited by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, he was looking for ideas on how to improve his health in the imperial and royal bath. Ultimately the emperor joined a spa project in Bad Hofgastein that was financed by Ladislaus Pyrker. An English coffeehouses was built in 1850 in Bad Gastein.

Radon therapy began to be administered in Bad Gastein. Radon inhalation therapy at the &quot;Gasteiner Heilstollen&quot; began as a result of further investigation into the experiences of humans who worked in silver mining who noticed improvements in symptoms from various ailments.

The Grandhotel Gasteinerhof has residential outbuildings and modern urban design integrates the historic ensemble, which includes a spa with a glass corridor over a creek with pristine alpine water.

The Austrian spa of Bad Gastein has special trains for spa guests, who are driven deep into the cave of the Böckstein mountain. There guests can lie for several hours to breathe in radon gas. To accommodate spa guests, the tunnels originally dug for gold mining have been converted.

== History ==
The remote valley was settled by Bavarian peasants in the 9th century; field names in the highest-lying southern parts also denote a Carantanian (Slavic) colonization. Gastein is first mentioned as &quot;Gastuna&quot; in a 963 deed, when the area belonged to the German stem duchy of Bavaria. It was originally an alpine farming and gold mining area and the site of an ancient trade route crossing the main ridge of the Central Eastern Alps. In 1297 Otto III, Duke of Bavaria and his brother Stephen I, Duke of Bavaria, both highly indebted, sold it to the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Already about 1230, the minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental had referred to the hot springs in his Middle High German poem &quot;Die Graserin in der Gastein&quot;. The spas in Bad Gastein were visited by the House of Habsburg emperor Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. The Renaissance physician Paracelsus also visited Bad Gastein.

===High society===
The waters of Bad Gastein were fashionable. Notable guests of the past included Franz Grillparzer, Arthur Schopenhauer, Franz Schubert, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Franz Joseph I of Austria, Wilhelm I, German Emperor, Otto von Bismarck, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and other members of the high society.

===Mass tourism===
At the end of the 19th century skiing was developed as tourism activity in the alps. Resorts such as Davos and St. Moritz catered to the wealthy health tourist, while popular mass tourism could only be sustained with the expansion of the railroads. Bad Gastein, Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, and Bad Ischl were established as health spas.

In the 1960s Bad Gastein was frequented by Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Those who could afford to visit their &quot;old home&quot; (&quot;alte Heimat&quot;) met in Bad Gastein. Returning from their travels they shared their experiences with other refugees in newsletters and presentations.

From the 1960s on the Bad Gastein lost some of its former reputation and many older hotels sat empty. Recently, Bad Gastein renovated its &quot;Felsentherme&quot; in 2014.

== Sports ==

Bad Gastein is popular for winter sports. Bad Gastein hosted the 1958 World Championships in alpine skiing and regularly is a scene of the snowboarding and boardercross world cup.

<text>The Royal Scottish Society of Arts is a learned society in Scotland, dedicated to the study of science and technology. It was founded as The Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in Scotland by Sir David Brewster in 1821 and dedicated to &quot;the promotion of invention and enterprise&quot;. The Society was granted a Royal Charter in 1841.

== Background ==
For many years the promotion of invention and improvements of all sorts was the main business of the Society, and its meetings were the focus of a large and active cross-section of Edinburgh society - academics, gentry, professionals such as civil engineers and lawyers, and skilled craftsmen such as instrument makers, engravers and printers. The Society&#x27;s published Transactions provide a record of changes in technology, and the Society&#x27;s archive is held by the National Library of Scotland, and is a valuable resource to researchers.

In more recent times, the Society&#x27;s meeting programme has been based on lectures given by expert and often distinguished speakers. The lectures cover a wide range of scientific and technical topics, and still with the original aim of keeping the membership informed about current concerns in science, engineering, medicine, and often with a topical edge.

Meetings of the Society are held in Edinburgh monthly, at 7pm on Monday evenings, from October or November to May or June. In addition, organised visits are made each year to a research, manufacturing or industrial establishment.

==Presidents of the Society==
Presidents of the society have been:
==Awards==
The society awards the Makdougall Brisbane medal, founded by Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane. This award is not to be confused with the similarly named award given by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

* David Stevenson (1815–1886), civil engineer
* c.1890: William Galt Black, &quot;for his wind gauge&quot;
* 1892: James Blyth, &quot;for his wind turbine&quot; 
* 1910: David Thomas Gwynne-Vaughan

<text>Jean André Wahl (; 25 May 1888 – 19 June 1974) was a French philosopher.

==Early career==
Wahl was educated at the École Normale Supérieure. He was a professor at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, broken by World War II. He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp (north-east of Paris) and then escaped.

He began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s (his book on Hegel was published in 1929), ahead of Alexandre Kojève&#x27;s more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist Søren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books &quot;Le malheur de la conscience dans la Philosophie de Hegel&quot; (1929) and &quot;Études kierkegaardiennes&quot; (1938) were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of &quot;Acéphale&quot;, Georges Bataille&#x27;s review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled &quot;Nietzsche and the Death of God&quot;, concerning Karl Jaspers&#x27; interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher, in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete.

==In exile==
While in the USA, Wahl with Gustave Cohen and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation founded a &#x27;university in exile&#x27;, the &quot;École Libre des Hautes Études&quot;, in New York City. Later, at Mount Holyoke where he had a position, he set up the &quot;Décades de Mount Holyoke&quot;, also known as &quot;Pontigny-en-Amérique&quot;, modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins (22 November 1859 - 13 March 1940) at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy. These successfully gathered together French intellectuals in wartime exile, ostensibly studying the English language, with Americans including Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and Roger Sessions. Wahl, already a published poet, made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the Four Quartets and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. (See, e.g., his &quot;On Reading the Four Quartets.&quot; )

==Post World War II==
In post-war France Wahl was an important figure, as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the Collège philosophique, influential center for non-conformist intellectuals, alternative to the Sorbonne. Starting in 1950, he headed the &quot;Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale&quot;.

Wahl translated the second hypothesis of the &quot;Parmenides&quot; of Plato as &quot;&quot;Il y a de l&#x27;Un&quot;, and Jacques Lacan adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis, as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan, and the negative one is &quot;Il n&#x27;y a pas de rapport sexuel&quot; &quot; — there is no sexual relationship.

== Wahl in literature ==
In 2021, Angelico Press published W. C. Hackett&#x27;s novella &quot;Outside the Gates&quot;, based on the true story of Wahl&#x27;s release from the Drancy Internment Camp. The narrator in the novella is Wahl himself, who alternatively tells what he is experiencing and muses philosophically on his situation in life, his sufferings and the sufferings of others in the war, and on whether or not there is a God. Hackett, himself a professional philosopher, artfully weaves in to the narrative former students and colleagues of Wahl.

<text>Gertrude of Merania ( 1185 – 28 September 1213) was Queen of Hungary as the first wife of Andrew II from 1205 until her assassination. She was regent during her husband&#x27;s absence.

==Life==

Gertrude was the daughter of the Bavarian Count Berthold IV of Andechs, Margrave of Carniola and Istria, and his wife Agnes from the Saxon House of Wettin. Gertrude&#x27;s elder sister was Agnes of Merania, a famous beauty, who married King Philip II of France. Her younger sister was St. Hedwig of Silesia, wife of the Piast duke Henry I the Bearded, the later High Duke of Poland. Their brothers were Otto, who inherited the title of Duke of Merania and succeeded their father in his Bavarian domains, Henry who took over the rule in Carniola and Istria, and Berthold who became a close advisor to Gertrude and was named Archbishop of Kalocsa.

==Marriage==
Gertrude&#x27;s parents arranged political marriages for their daughters, creating alliances for her father, Duke Berthold. Gertrude married the Árpád prince Andrew II, younger son of late King Béla III of Hungary, before 1204. Andrew thereby took sides in the conflict over the German throne, joining his father-in-law in his support of Duke Philip of Swabia, while his elder brother King Emeric of Hungary backed King Otto IV of Germany.

They had:
* Anna Maria of Hungary (c. 1204 – 1237), wife of Tzar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria
* King Béla IV of Hungary (1206 – 3 May 1270)
* Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (1207 – 10 November 1231), wife of Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia
* King Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria (1208 – June 1241)
* Prince Andrew II of Halych (c. 1210 – 1234)

===Queen===
Ambitious Gertrude exerted much political influence over her husband. It was probably she who persuaded Andrew to conspire against his brother again, but when King Emeric, who had realised that Andrew&#x27;s troops outnumbered his armies, went unarmed, wearing only the crown and the sceptre, to Andrew&#x27;s camp near Varasd, Andrew surrendered voluntarily in the spur of the moment. The king had his brother arrested, but Andrew managed to escape shortly afterwards. During this time, Gertrude was sent back to her father. Things improved for her, when Prince Andrew took over the government of the Hungarian kingdom upon the death of King Emeric in 1204, officially as regent for his minor nephew Ladislaus III, who nevertheless died in exile one year later.

===Regent===
While the king was in battle, Gertrude gave out Hungarian land as &quot;gifts&quot; to her favorites. According to medieval chroniclers, one third of the country was given away but the magnates got it back after the queen&#x27;s death. Thus, Hungary did not prosper. During the frequent absence of her husband, the queen was regent and, as Dietrich of Apolda states, conducted the affairs of the kingdom &quot;like a man&quot;. In 1206, her younger brother Berthold was installed as Archbishop of Kalocsa. In 1212, he was also appointed Voivode of Transylvania.

==Death==
While King Andrew was campaigning in Galicia, a Hungarian noble, Peter, son of Töre, decided to assassinate the queen and in 1213, on a hunt with Berthold and their guest Duke Leopold VI of Austria in the Pilis Mountains, she was killed. Gertrude&#x27;s body was torn to pieces, while her brother and Duke Leopold narrowly escaped with their lives. 
According to recent research, the perpetrator could have been a serious lone criminal with a personal motive. It is possible that there was something between him and the queen. It raises questions, e.g. why would the royal bodyguard allow a man armed with a sword into the queen&#x27;s sleeping tent. Contrary to the previously widespread view, it is now known that when the king found out about his wife&#x27;s murder, he brutally executed justice and impalement the perpetrator. His son, King Béla IV, used the killing of his mother decades later for political showdowns, accusing non-genuine accomplices of earlier involvement.

Gertrude&#x27;s tomb was of a Gothic style. Her tomb was excavated between 1967 and 1980.

On Gertrude&#x27;s death, Andrew married Yolanda de Courtenay.

==In culture==
Gertrude is the main antagonist in both József Katona&#x27;s play, &quot;Bánk bán&quot; (1819) and the opera (1861) of the same name composed by Ferenc Erkel. They are fictionalized retellings of the assassination, in which the noble men of Hungary conspire against Queen Gertrude (called Gertrudis in the play and the opera) who exploited the people of Hungary as a regent and let them live in fear and poverty, while she herself was throwing feasts in the royal palace and giving titles and estates to her Meranian friends and relatives. The noble men only wait for the approval of Bánk bán, the most powerful among them, who is resistant to join. However, upon learning that Otto, Gertrude&#x27;s brother, drugged and raped his wife Melinda with the tacit approval of the queen, he breaks into the bed chamber of Gertrude at night and confronts her, which leads to a heated argument ending in the murder of the queen.

This story is strongly fictionalized and likely very inaccurate, as there are no reliable sources on the details of the assassination. There is no proof that Gertrude was an exploitative or negligent regent, and although Bánk bán was a real historical person, there&#x27;s no evidence that he was the one who murdered the queen and no records of him having a wife. Among Gertrude&#x27;s brothers, it wasn&#x27;t Otto, the Duke of Merania, but Berchtold, the Archbishop of Kalocs, who lived with her in Hungary and counseled her. Some sources written well after the events accuse him of seducing or raping Melinda, but such accusations could not be written about a priest in 1820, when the play was first published.

The play and the opera quickly became favorites in Hungary, which was under the rule of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, and national sentiments were strongly discouraged, while any straightforward criticism against the sovereign or the royal family was impossible because of the strict censorship rules.

<text>Mayrhofen is a town in the Zillertal (Ziller river valley) in the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is located approximately an hour from the Tyrolean capital city of Innsbruck.

==Population==
==Tourism==
The town offers a variety of summer and winter sports including skiing, hiking, mountain biking and paragliding. Mayrhofen is situated near the Hintertux glacier, which, at above sea level, is above the snowline. Skiing is available all year round here. Mayrhofen sits between the Penken and the Ahorn mountains which provide ski runs in the winter and mountain biking, hiking and paragliding in the summer. The Ahorn offers mainly easy and intermediate runs, but also has a long, steep black run (formerly red) which was once on the World Cup Downhill circuit but was removed as it was deemed too dangerous. The Penken mountain offers Austria&#x27;s steepest piste, named Harakiri, as well as a large range of ski runs at different levels of difficulty. It is connected by lifts with the villages of Finkenberg, Lanersbach and Schwendau.

The Penken is reached by a Gondola system, the , which is located on the main street next to the Sport Hotel Strass, in the centre of the village, while the Ahorn Cable car or , which with a capacity of 160 passengers is the largest cable car in Austria, is situated at the southern end of the town. Mayrhofen is a snowboard-minded village with a funpark sponsored by Vans, and the snowboardhotel Gasthof Zillertal owned by the Dutch organisation &#x27;SAIKO expeditions&#x27;. Mountaineer Peter Habeler and Downhill Racer Uli Spiess both come from Mayrhofen.

The town also provides an excellent base for walkers, as Mayrhofen is home to many trails touring the mountains and nearby Ziller valley.

== Events ==
Each spring (usually early April), Mayrhofen hosts the &quot;Snowbombing&quot; music festival. Since the initial event in 2000 (held in Risoul, France), snowbombing has gathered much notoriety and respect in the electronic dance music world as one of the major festivals. The event has been hosted by Mayrhofen since 2005.
==Climate==


== Transport ==

Mayrhofen has one railway station, which is located next to the Zillertaler Bundestrasse. The station is a terminus for all Train services operated by the Zillertalbahn, the valley&#x27;s main public transport operator. The railway runs between Jenbach and Mayrhofen itself, and there are several intermediate stations, which provide access to many of the valley&#x27;s well known ski areas, namely Zell am Ziller (Zillertal 3000), Fügen (Spieljoch) and Uderns (for the Hochfügen and Kaltenbach ski areas). The railway operates year-round, although in summer additional &#x27;special&#x27; services operate, such as a steam train service.

The Zillertalbahn also run bus routes in the valley, which are regular and cover an extensive area. Additional services also operate during the winter, to cater for the skiing season.

<text>Dollar Savings Bank of New York was a bank that operated in New York City between 1890 and 2004.

==History==
Dollar Savings Bank of New York was formed on June 23, 1890, of possibly 1887, founded by John Haffen.

In February 1983, after it was on the verge of bank failure, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department arranged for a merger of the bank with Dry Dock Savings Bank to form Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank.

On February 21, 1992, the bank and its 21 branches were seized by the New York State Banking Department with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named as receiver. Emigrant Savings Bank bought 20 of the branches and the Flushing branch was purchased by Apple Bank.

In 2011, the headquarters building in the Bronx was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1164871" wikidata="Q2156853" url="?curid=1164871" title="Robert Davidson (inventor)">
<text>Robert Davidson (18 April 1804 – 16 November 1894) was a Scottish inventor who built the first known electric locomotive in 1837.
He was a lifelong resident of Aberdeen, northeast Scotland, where he was a prosperous chemist and dyer, amongst other ventures. Davidson was educated at Marischal College, where he studied second and third year classes from 1819-1821, including lectures from Professor Patrick Copland. He got this education in return for being a lab assistant.

In the 1820s, he set up in business close to the Aberdeen-Inverurie Canal, at first supplying yeast, before becoming involved in the manufacture and supply of chemicals.

He became interested in the new electrical technologies of the day. From 1837, he made small electric motors on his own principles.

==Exhibitions==
Davidson staged an exhibition of electrical machinery at Aberdeen, Scotland, and in Edinburgh, where it was viewed on 12 February 1842 by the young James Clerk Maxwell.

Later he exhibited at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in London, where he hoped to attract sponsorship for his work. Among the machines shown were his locomotive, an electrically driven lathe and printing press, and an electromagnet capable of lifting 2 tons.

==First electric railway locomotive==
Davidson made a model electric locomotive in 1837. His &quot;Galvani&quot; of 1842 was a four-wheeled machine, powered by zinc-acid batteries. It was tested on the Edinburgh-Glasgow line in September 1842 and, although found capable of carrying itself at 4 mph, it did not haul any passengers or goods.
Davidson had trained as a chemist and made a successful business in the production of synthetic yeast for the baking and brewing industries. This gave him time to devote to his hobby of electromagnetism. He designed his own chemical batteries to provide power and, being a practical man, was enthusiastic about the potential of electromagnetism to drive machinery. By 1839 he had designed a printing press, a turning lathe and a four-wheeled car that all used Davidson&#x27;s batteries and rudimentary electric motor. Davidson decided to demonstrate
his inventions to the public and arranged an exhibition of his work, first of all in Aberdeen and subsequently in Edinburgh. He converted his car to run on a circular
wooden track for the exhibition and even printed the handbills advertising the show on his electrically-driven printing press. Davidson had such faith in the opportunities that
electromagnetism offered that he had his eye on a bigger and more ambitious scheme.

He approached the directors of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway for their support in building an electromagnetic railway locomotive. Davidson aimed to show the new railway company that electric locomotives were a practical option. He obtained the endorsement of the Royal Scottish Society for Arts in his ventures and they made him a £15 grant. He built a full size locomotive, &quot;Galvani&quot; of 1842, which was a four-wheeled machine, 16 feet long and powered by Davidson&#x27;s batteries. It was trialled on a section of the Edinburgh to Glasgow line in 1842 and was thus the world&#x27;s first electrically powered railway locomotive. This was its only claim to fame as the locomotive only managed to achieve a speed of 4 mph and as the batteries were not rechargeable, it was hardly practical. The directors were not sufficiently impressed to ask Davidson to take the concept further. The locomotive was reported as being destroyed whilst stored in the engine house at Perth.

===Davidson&#x27;s legacy===
He has been described as a forgotten hero and electrical visionary. He could not interest the rail companies; the technology he employed was too expensive.

In 1840, the &quot;Aberdeen Banner&quot; had predicted that the type of machinery he was producing &quot;will in no distant date supplant steam&quot;; however, it was only when electric locomotives were introduced in the 1890s that the media came to recognize what he had done. He was described as the &quot;oldest living electrician&quot; and &quot;The Electrician&quot; magazine reported &quot;Robert Davidson was undoubtedly the first to demonstrate the possibility of electrical traction in a practical way&quot;.

A working model of his electrical motor can be seen at the Grampian Transport Museum.

==Business and later life==
After 1843, at home in Aberdeen, he settled down to family life and, for the next fifty years, the running of his business at Canal Road. His earlier invention of a method for large-scale production of yeast, one of the staples of his chemical business, and the manufacture of perfumes were so remunerative that it allowed him to indulge his many interests of astronomy, collecting of fine china, valuable pictures and a large collection of violins.

<text>The Swiss National Park (; ; ; ) is located in the Western Rhaetian Alps, in eastern Switzerland. It lies within the canton of Graubünden, between Zernez, S-chanf, Scuol, and the Fuorn Pass in the Engadin valley on the border with Italy. Founded in 1914, the Swiss National Park is the oldest national park in the alps and in Central Europe.

It is part of the worldwide UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and has IUCN category Ia, which is the highest category, signifying a strict nature reserve. Today, the Swiss National Park has an area of 170.3 km2 and is the largest nature reserve in Switzerland.

== Description ==

The Swiss National Park covers various terrains, from relatively low valleys to high peaks. The highest peak in the National Park is Piz Quattervals, 3165 m.a.s.l, which can be reached by an alpine hike. As of 2022, this is the only National Park in Switzerland. There are plans to create more. 
An Adula National Park was planned in the Adula Alps, but in November 2016 the inhabitants voted against it.

In the national park, it is forbidden to leave marked paths or to sleep anywhere apart from the &quot;Chamanna Cluozza,&quot; the mountain hut in the park. Due to this there are over 80 kilometers of marked hiking paths, separated into 21 individual hikes of various distances and difficulties. Dogs are not allowed, even on a leash. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps which has been categorized by the IUCN as a strict nature reserve, the highest protection level.

A visitor centre is located in Zernez. The road through the park leads over the Fuorn Pass (or &quot;Ofenpass&quot;) to South Tyrol in Italy. In addition to the Swiss National Park, there are sixteen regional nature parks in Switzerland.

The Swiss National Park is home to several large animals. Visitors of the park will often hear and see alpine marmots. These may even be observed from very close up in one of the many designated resting places within the park. Other large animals include ibex, red deer, chamois, red fox, golden eagles and many more. Occasionally wolves and brown bears are also observed in the park but only rarely and these animals do not permanently reside in the park any more.

== History ==
After the 19th century led to a lot of the Swiss countryside being destroyed or cultivated to create space for farming in 1904 Swiss National Council Dr. Fritz E. Bühlmann among others called for the creation of a nature reserve. The Swiss Federal Council created a committee to determine a suitable location for this nature reserve, and the area surrounding the Fuorn Pass was found to be best suited for this endeavour due to its remoteness from civilization and richness in flora and fauna. In 1909 supporters of the idea leased the Val Cluozza from the municipality of Zernez for 25 years. In 1913 a non-standing committee of the Federal assembly visited the Val Cluozza and afterwards supported the idea of a national park. Within the following year the region around the Fuorn Pass and the Val Minger were leased from their respective municipality and the lease of the Val Cluozza was renewed to now all last 99 years. The municipality of Zernez was increasingly supporting the idea due to the fact that the leased area had little to no agricultural potential. On the national holiday of Switzerland, 1 August 1914, the Swiss National Park was opened. Initially the costs of the lease were paid by a private company, called the &quot;Schweizerischer Bund für Naturschutz&quot; (Swiss coalition for nature protection), which today is called &quot;Pro Natura&quot;. However, when in 1913 these costs could no longer be surmounted by the private company, the Swiss Federal Government took over the costs.

In 1936, the Val Tavrü was removed from the Park upon request by the municipality of Scuol. In 1959, the National Park was legally restructured. A law called the &quot;Bundesbeschluss für den Nationalpark&quot; (Federal law concerning the National Park) was passed, which among other things extended the leases indefinitely and banned high voltage lines leading through the park. In 1961, the park was heavily extended once more, now totalling 166.5 km2.

In 1964, zoologist Robert F. Schloeth was appointed director of the park. He would go on to serve in that post for more than 25 years while heavily influencing the parks&#x27; development. In 1968, during his tenure a new visitor centre was inaugurated in Zernez as was a &quot;Naturlernpfad&quot; (Nature learning hike) on the Fuorn pass in 1976. It was during Schloeth&#x27;s tenure as director that the park would become part of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and would be classified as a IUCN category Ia.

The most recent extension of the park occurred in 2000, when 3.6 km2 the Macun Lakes and surrounding area was added to the park. There was a proposition to create a less heavily regulated zone in the areas surrounding the park, which was however rejected by the public. In 2008, a new visitor centre was inaugurated in Zernez. Some of the changes in territory that the park underwent since its inception in 1909 are detailed in the table below:
== Park rules ==
In the park, visitors have to follow strict rules. These rules are regulated in a special cantonal law by the canton of Grisons and enforced by park rangers throughout the park. If these rules are not followed, the park rangers may fine visitors up to 300 swiss francs. Some of the rules are as follows:

* It is strictly forbidden to leave the marked paths as well as the resting areas marked with posts. The route of these paths is defined in cantonal law. Violating this rule will lead to a fine of 250 CHF.
* No litter. Violating this rule will lead to a fine of 100 CHF.
* No natural object may be picked or removed: animals, plants, sticks, stones, etc.
* Dogs are not allowed in the Park, not even on a lead.
* Entry in winter is forbidden.
* No winter sports, cycling or flying of any sort are permitted.
* Bathing in lakes, pools, streams and rivers is not permitted.
* No camp fires. Violation of this rule will lead to a fine of 300 CHF.
* Overnight stays are strictly forbidden, including in parked vehicles alongside the main Pass dal Fuorn road as well as bivouac.
* Nature must be left undisturbed.
* Flying drones of any kind is forbidden.

== Hiking routes ==
There are 21 numbered hiking routes in the National Park, of which 3 and 4 are alpine hikes. Hike no. 4 leads on top of Piz Quattervals (3165 m.a.s.l.), which is the highest peak in the park.
==Notable peaks==
*Piz Pisoc, 3173 m.
*Piz Quattervals, 3165 m.
*Piz da l&#x27;Acqua, 3126 m.
*Piz Chaschauna, 3071 m.

<text>Irena Wiśniewska-Santor ( ; born 9 December 1934), known professionally as Irena Santor, is a Polish singer, musical performer and actress.

Her career started in 1950. She&#x27;s noted for singing in clear mezzo-soprano, considered one of Poland&#x27;s biggest icons and is referred to as an influence for younger singers. 
From 1951 to 1959 Irena Santor (then Wiśniewska) was a member and the main soloist of the Polish folk group Mazowsze, with whom she toured all continents. After leaving the group she decided to start a solo career. She has been awarded many prizes in Poland and abroad.

Irena Santor made her acting debut in Stanisław Bareja&#x27;s film Przygoda z piosenką (1968). She appeared in many TV and radio shows and sat on juries for a number of talent shows and song competitions. The singer also recorded soundtracks to Polish and Soviet films.

In 2017, as the first singer in Poland, she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her accomplishments.

In 2021, she announced that she ended her professional career.

== Early life and education ==
Irena Wiśniewska was born on 9 December 1934 in Papowo Biskupie in northern Poland. She spent her childhood in Solec Kujawski, where her family had moved in the mid-1930s. Her father, Bernard Wiśniewski, was murdered by the German Selbstschutz in the autumn of 1939, a few weeks after the start of World War II. Her mother worked as a seamstress.

After the war Irena&#x27;s mother&#x27;s health was failing. In 1948, Irena and her mother lived in Polanica-Zdrój, a health resort in Silesia, where Irena attended the Glass Decoration Gymnasium, and then the Vocational School of Glass Industry, in nearby Szczytna. Teachers discovered her vocal talent and at the end of the 1940s sent her to song competitions.

== Career ==
In 1950 she met Zdzisław Górzyński, a prominent director of the Grand Theatre, Poznań, who visited Polanica-Zdrój. Górzyński was impressed with her vocal and recommended her to Tadeusz Sygietyński, who was creator and manager of the folk group Mazowsze. He organised casting and accepted Irena&#x27;s candidacy but stipulated that she will take singing lessons under the direction of opera singer Wanda Wermińska. She agreed. Her mother died that same year, so Irena moved to the Karolin, where she graduated music school and passed the matura exam. Her classmate in this term was actress Lidia Korsakówna.

She was the main soloist in a folk group Mazowsze. With the group she appeared in the first Polish color movie &quot;Przygoda na Mariensztacie&quot; (1953) and they recorded soundtrack to movie. In the 1950s she traveled around the world with the band. Later on in her life, Irena Santor revealed that she performed for Mao Zedong, which she regrets now. During that time she met her future husband, Stanisław Santor, who was a violinist in &quot;Mazowsze&quot;. Her most popular song from this period was &quot;Ej, przeleciał ptaszek&quot; – originally a folk song.

After her marriage to Stanisław Santor, she left the group and started a solo career.

In 2019 she was celebrating the diamond jubilee of her career with a concert tour called &quot;Jubileusz, śpiewam, czyli jestem&quot; (&quot;Jubilee, I sing, therefore I am&quot;).

On November 25, 2024, the &quot;Vistula Sounds&quot; International Festival was officially named after Irena Santor. The event took place at the City Hall in Ciechocinek in the presence of the artist. Starting with the 4th edition of the event in 2025 the official name will be: Irena Santor &quot;Vistula Sounds&quot; International Festival.

== Private life ==
In 1958 she married Stanisław Santor. The couple divorced after 19 years, but they remained on good terms until his death in 1999.

Until his death in 2018 her partner was Zbigniew Korpolewski, whom she met in the 1990s.

<doc id="1164884" wikidata="Q5424052" url="?curid=1164884" title="F. T. F. Lovejoy">
<text>Francis Thomas Fletcher Lovejoy (1854–1932) was an American industrialist and an associate of Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Henry Phipps, Jr. and Charles M. Schwab in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation.

==Early life==
F. T. F., as he was known, was born on July 21, 1854, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of William A. Lovejoy and his wife Mary Jane Robinson. In the late 1850s, William and his brothers Perry, George, Samuel and sister Jane, and their families, left Maryland and moved to southeastern Ohio.

===First jobs===
Around 1870, at the age of 16, FTF left home in Guernsey County, Ohio, and went to Washington, Pennsylvania, where he obtained employment as a telegrapher. Shortly after that he went to Titusville, Pennsylvania, then the center of the new oil industry, and engaged in many different employments in that area, including the oil, telegraph and newspaper businesses.

===Joins Carnegie Company===
After ten years in Titusville, FTF went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he joined Carnegie Brothers Company in June 1881. His rise there was rapid and by 1889, at the age of 35, was an equity owner in the business. Two years later he was a member of the board of directors, sitting with such prominent titans of industry as Carnegie, Frick, Schwab and Phipps.

==Prominent businessman==
All through the 1890s, FTF continued his rise in the Carnegie companies, with the full trust and confidence of everyone in the inner circle. However, Carnegie and Frick had a falling out over the management and direction of the companies, resulting in a lawsuit by Frick against Carnegie. FTF, in order to resolve this matter, took the radical step of resigning all of his positions, thereby becoming a neutral party, trusted by all sides, and worked out the &quot;new agreement,&quot; as it was known, under which the United States Steel Company was to be formed.
FTF later invested his substantial assets into gold mining interests in Idaho.

==Family life==
In 1892, FTF married Jane Clyde Fleming (1869–1941). Their children were Francis Fleming Lovejoy (1894–1916); Kenneth Frick Lovejoy (1896–1947); and Marjory (1899–1980). Kenneth (known as Curley) was one of the first air mail pilots, flying out of Bettis Field near Pittsburgh. FTF himself is reputed to be the first American ever to ride a bicycle.

FTF died on December 5, 1932 and is buried in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny Cemetery along with Jane and their three children.

==Retirement==
FTF was interested in genealogy and carried out a genealogical correspondence with Clarence Lovejoy (author of &quot;Lovejoy&#x27;s College Guide&quot;), tracing the family back to England.

<doc id="1164887" wikidata="Q3821351" url="?curid=1164887" title="True History of the Kelly Gang">
<text>True History of the Kelly Gang is a novel by Australian writer Peter Carey, based loosely on the history of the Kelly Gang. It was first published in Brisbane by the University of Queensland Press in 2000. It won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize in the same year. Despite its title, the book is fiction and a variation on the Ned Kelly story. 

==Plot summary==
Ned Kelly begins his autobiography with a description of his father, John &quot;Red&quot; Kelly, an Irishman transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and eventually settling in the colony of Victoria, Australia. After marrying Ned&#x27;s mother Ellen (née Quinn), the Kellys settle in Avenel, a rural area northeast of Melbourne. Red Kelly is shown to have numerous brushes with the colonial police forces, resulting in his imprisonment and death when his son Ned was twelve years of age.

After the rest of the family resettles in northeast Victoria under the Land Grant Act, Ned&#x27;s mother attempts to provide for her children by running a shebeen and taking on a series of lovers, including the notorious bushranger Harry Power. Power agrees to take on the young Ned as an apprentice, and provides Ned with knowledge of the land, hideouts, and strategies for bushranging. Kelly eventually leaves Power and returns to his family&#x27;s settlement, where he is shown making dogged attempts to live an honest lifestyle.

Kelly is arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for the reception of a stolen horse (although Kelly claims that a friend, &quot;Wild&quot; Wright, knowingly sold him the stolen horse without Kelly&#x27;s knowledge – Kelly later exacts revenge on Wright in a bare-knuckle boxing match). After two years of working as a sawmill hand, he is drawn back to bushranging when a herd of his horses is appropriated by a rival squatter. His descent back into crime is precipitated by a visit from a local police officer, Constable Alex Fitzpatrick. The policeman woos Ned&#x27;s younger sister, Kate, prompting Ned to reveal that Fitzpatrick has multiple mistresses in other towns and has no intention of marrying Kate. After his mother Ellen threatens the constable with violence, Fitzpatrick pulls his revolver on the family and Ned shoots him in the hand in self-defense. Although he dresses the wound and Fitzpatrick leaves while promising that no action will be taken, warrants for the arrest of Ned and his younger brother Dan are issued the next day.

Ned Kelly and his brother Dan hide out in the hills of northeast Victoria, eventually being joined by their friends Steve Hart and Joe Byrne (later becoming known as the Kelly Gang). Kelly&#x27;s mother is eventually arrested along with her baby daughter and imprisoned in Melbourne as an enticement for Kelly to give himself up. A detachment of four policemen is eventually sent to kill the quartet after efforts to arrest them prove unsuccessful; the Kelly Gang ambushes them at Stringybark Creek, where Ned kills three of the policemen. This adds to the growing folklore surrounding the Kelly Gang, which they fuel by robbing banks and giving parts of the money to the lower-class settlers in Victoria who help to shelter the gang.

During the gang&#x27;s raids, Ned Kelly meets a young Irish girl named Mary Hearn, who already has a young son by Kelly&#x27;s stepfather, George King. Kelly falls in love with Mary and makes plans to escape the colony with her after she becomes pregnant with his child. Crucially, it is Mary who motivates Kelly to begin writing the story of his life as a legacy for his future child, who she fears will never know its father. Following two successful bank robberies, Mary uses the money to emigrate to San Francisco with her son and Kelly&#x27;s unborn daughter; Kelly remains behind, however, unwilling to leave Australia until his mother is released from jail.

The gang is eventually cornered by a large squad of dozens of policemen (versus just four in the Kelly Gang) in the town of Glenrowan where the gang has taken numerous hostages and constructed several suits of plate-steel armour for protection. One of the hostages is the crippled local schoolmaster, Thomas Curnow, who encourages Kelly to relate the story of his entire life after seeing samples of his writing. Curnow betrays the gang by warning the incoming police train that the gang has sabotaged the tracks, feeling that history will view him as a &quot;hero&quot;. The policemen surround the town and engage in a furious shootout with the armour-clad gang, seriously wounding Ned Kelly and killing the other three members of the gang. Kelly&#x27;s narrative stops abruptly just before the shootout itself; a secondary narrator, identified as &quot;S.C&quot;, relates the tale of the gunfight and Kelly&#x27;s death by hanging. Since Curnow is shown to have escaped Glenrowan with Kelly&#x27;s manuscripts, it is assumed that this narrator is a relative of Curnow&#x27;s. Kelly dies a hero to the people of northeastern Victoria, with the legend of his life left to grow over time.

==Technique==
The novel is divided into thirteen sections (each ostensibly written by Kelly), with a short description at the beginning of each section describing the physical condition of the original manuscripts. The novel also includes a preface and a frame narrative at the end which describe the events of Kelly&#x27;s final shootout at Glenrowan and his eventual death sentence. Carey departs from what is known about Kelly&#x27;s life by providing him with a lover and a daughter, for whom he has been recording his life history whilst on the run from the police.
The novel is written in a distinctive vernacular style, with little in the way of punctuation or grammar; the influence of Kelly&#x27;s Irish heritage is also apparent in his language. The style is similar to Kelly&#x27;s most famous surviving piece of writing, The Jerilderie Letter. Excepting the frame narratives of &quot;S.C&quot;, the novel does not contain any commas. Although there is much profanity in the novel, it has been censored (replacing vulgarities with terms such as &quot;effing&quot; or &quot;adjectival&quot;) for the benefit of Kelly&#x27;s fictional daughter, presumably by Kelly himself.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot; was generally well-received. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. According to Book Marks, primarily from American publications, the book received a &quot;rave&quot; consensus, based on ten critic reviews: nine &quot;rave&quot; and one &quot;positive&quot;. Globally, it was generally well received with Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Most very enthusiastic about it, with many feeling it is exceptionally good. Particular praise for Carey&#x27;s/Kelly&#x27;s voice. A variety of generally minor reservations.&quot;.

English writer Robert McCrum named &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot; one of the 100 greatest novels written in English. In 2019, the novel was ranked 53rd on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

In an effort to attract American readers to the story, the book&#x27;s American publisher, Alfred Knopf, heralded the book as a &quot;Great American Novel&quot;, even though the novel takes place entirely within Australia. The claim that this book is an &quot;American novel&quot; appears to be based on the fact that author Peter Carey, an Australian, has lived in New York City for many years.

== Fiction vs known facts ==

This novel uses many aspects of the history of the Kelly Gang, but much of it is invented, and some facts are distorted.

The &#x27;parcels&#x27; are entirely an invention of the author, as is the &quot;Sons of Sieve&quot;, and the suggestion that Ellen Kelly and Harry Power were lovers. The character Mary Hearne, and her children, are entirely fictional; Ned Kelly is not known to have fathered any children in his lifetime, nor was he known to be romantically involved with any woman during his outlawry.

=== Notes ===

* In a 2001 press release the administrators of the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards, the State Library of Victoria, erroneously named Frank Moorhouse&#x27;s &quot;Dark Palace&quot; as the winner of that year&#x27;s award, when in fact the decision had gone to &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation of Carey&#x27;s novel was released in Australian cinemas in January 2020. Directed by Justin Kurzel, the film&#x27;s cast includes George MacKay as Ned Kelly and Russell Crowe as Harry Power.

<doc id="1164889" wikidata="Q946011" url="?curid=1164889" title="Totley">
<text>Totley is a suburb on the extreme southwest of the city of Sheffield, in South Yorkshire, England. Lying within the historic county boundaries of Derbyshire, Totley was amalgamated into the city of Sheffield in 1933, and is today part of the Dore and Totley electoral ward in the city, though it remains close to the contemporary county boundary of Derbyshire. Totley had a population of 7,963 in 2011.

Totley was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Totinglee&quot;, the name meaning a forest clearing belonging to Tota (probably the Saxon lord). Totley Hall, built in 1623 and enlarged in the 19th century, was converted to a teacher training college in the 1950s and was latterly part of Sheffield Hallam University.

Through the district run the Totley Brook and the Old Hay Brook, which meet here to form the River Sheaf. Totley also lends its name to Totley Tunnel, which from 1893 to 2007 was the longest underland main line rail tunnel in the United Kingdom, taking the Sheffield to Manchester line from Totley underneath Totley Moor to Grindleford in Derbyshire. However, there are now longer rail tunnels in Kent and Greater London that were bored in connection with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (HS1) which opened in 2007, and with the Elizabeth Line (Crossrail) which opened in 2022.

==History and geography==
Totley was first referred to in the Domesday Survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror, where it was named as Totingelei. It has since had many spellings:
*1086 Totingelei
*1221 Totenleg
*1234 Totingly
*1275 Tottle
*1293 Totleye
*1320 Toteleye
*1476 Tottynley
*1487 Totteley
*1585 Tottley
*1629 Totles
*1641 Tottingley

The Domesday book says&quot;: In Totinglei, Tolf had IV bovates of land hidable. Land for one plough. It is waste, wood, pasturable, 1 mile in length and half a mile in breadth. T.R.E. value X shillings now XII pence.&quot;

The area of Totley in 1086 was quite small, but by 1839 had grown seven-fold. The borders of Totley are agreed to be the Old Hay Brook, Totley Brook, Brown Edge, Lady Cross, Stony Ridge, along Hathersage Road and Blacka Dike.
The lowest point is the junction between Old Hay Brook and Totley Brook (beginning of the River Sheaf) at 400 ft, the highest point is Flask Edge at 1300 ft.

The underground is rich, and Totley Brick Works still produce bricks and ceramics to this day.

At one time, Totley was a township in the parish of Dronfield, in the hundred of Scarsdale, a sub-division of the county of Derbyshire. In 1866 Totley became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Sheffield and Holmesfield. In 1931 the parish had a population of 1451. Totley, along with Dore and Bradway became part of Hallam Ward, part of the City of Sheffield and the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is now in the unparished area of Sheffield.

Totley is made of Totley Village (Hillfoot Road and Totley Hall Lane), Totley Moor (unpopulated), Totley Bents (Penny Lane), New Totley (called as such since the 30s) and Totley Rise (Baslow Road shops and Lower Bradway Bank).

===Cannon Hall===

Parish and council records show that the Pearsons family has lived in Totley since at least 1550 and still live in the village. Samuel Pearson farmed the area in 1550. In 1897, George Creswick bought the house and the land.

===Totley Hall===

Totley Hall is generally believed to date back to at least 1623, as this date is carved over the Tudor arched doorway on the building&#x27;s main facade. The carvings bear the characters GN 1623 WM, which seems to mean George Newbould. However the hall was the home of the Barker family, who were the squires of Dore and Totley for many generations. Which also seems to suggest the construction of the hall could have been commissioned by Edward Barker of Dore Hall, the current squire in 1623. The Barker family left their coat of arms above the fireplace in the main entrance lobby. The hall passed out of the ownership of the Barker family in the late 18th century. The hall was extended by John Dodsley Webster in 1883 and 1894.
According to maps, fields have existed before this date as well as small buildings which would have been farm buildings.

In 1791, Andrew Gallimore left the estate to his niece Hannah, wife of the Rev. D&#x27;Ewes Coke of Nottinghamshire. Coke died in 1811, and his son, another D&#x27;Ewes Coke, took over the hall and provided money for the construction of the infant school. The family sold the Totley Hall in 1881 to W.K. Marples for £2250. It is at this period that the hall and the farm became two distinct properties.

William Aldam Milner built the lodge on Totley Hall Lane in 1887. His son was killed in World War I and as a sign of thanks the saddened community gave land and £2000 to build a new church. All Saints church opened in 1924. Milner died in 1931. The hall with 160 acres of land was bought by Sheffield Corporation for £5850 in July 1944. Until 1999, Totley Hall was owned by Sheffield Polytechnic which became Sheffield Hallam University in 1991. Sheffield Hallam University sold the property to developers who converted the hall into luxury apartments.
===The Old School House===
The Infant School was built in 1821. The first contingent of pupils were 11 boys and 19 girls as well as one school mistress. Hannal Wild taught there in 1833; in 1852 Ann Padley took over and stayed for 20 years.

===Totley Grange===
Totley Grange was built between 1883 and 1888 by Thomas Earnshaw, together with its Lodge, on the land which he had purchased north of the Baslow to Sheffield turnpike road. He also built stables, a stable yard and a coach house, accessed via Butts Hill past Cannon Hill farm, together with a range of glasshouses within the walled garden. An indenture dated 2 April 1875 confirmed absolute sale by Thomas Andrews to Thomas Earnshaw of land and hereditaments at Totley of more than two acres bounded to the north and east by land of Ebenezer Hall and to the south by the turnpike road. On 31 December 1875 the freehold was conveyed to Thomas Earnshaw at a cost of £946.17 shillings and sixpence. Another conveyance between Ebenezer Hall to Thomas Earnshaw was of the freehold ground, buildings and hereditaments dated 27 March 1878 of a little over 3 acres, which included Moorview house and the six cottages of Shrewsbury Terrace. The land abutted Thomas Earnshaw’s previous purchase to the south. It was on this land, that between 1883 and 1888 Thomas Earnshaw built Totley Grange and its Lodge. In March 1879 Thomas Earnshaw purchased an acre of land from Helen and Charles Beckett which included a dwelling house (subsequently demolished) and the terrace of houses facing the Cross Scythes public house; to which he added Grange Terrace, a row of eight houses.

Additionally, from John Howard, Thomas Earnshaw purchased land to the east of the 1 acre plot, of a little over 4 acres, which subsequently became the site of the Totley Primary School. During the Second World War Totley Grange was used for essential war work by JG Graves, assembling wire bundles for a range of aircraft. In 1948 the trustees of the Thomas Earnshaw trust converted Totley Grange into five flats. Finally in 1965 Totley Grange, the Lodge and all of the outbuildings and gardens, amounting to approximately 6 acres were purchased by George Wimpey and it is on this land the Totley Grange estate of 65 houses was built.

===All Saints Church===

The parish of Totley is served by All Saints Church, a Church of England church. The Rev’d Jermyn Hutton, the parish&#x27;s first vicar was appointed on Sunday, 23 March 1924.

On Saturday, 15 November 1924 the church building was consecrated by The Lord Bishop of Southwell. The church building is built on land given by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Milner of Totley Hall.  The Chancel is dedicated to their younger son, Sec. Lt. Roy Milner, who was sadly killed in World War I.

The church maintains links with the Totley All Saints School and Totley Primary School. They run sessions in the library for the elderly in the community and for the Mickley Hall care home. In 2024 with the huge rise in children and young people attending the church their first children&#x27;s youth and families minister was appointed who serves the community alongside the Rev&#x27;d Ben Tanner, present vicar of Totley. 

==Industry==
As a rural village the main industry has historically been agriculture, and several farms remain in Totley . As well as agriculture, the brooks running through the village have been used as a source of power for small industrial operations since at least the 17th century. In particular, several mills have stood on Old Hay Brook, engaged in activities such as lead smelting, corn grinding, blade manufacture and paper rolling.
The only industry still open is the Totley Brick Works on Baslow Road. This plant supplied the bricks for the construction of Totley Tunnel and currently produces heat-resistant bricks from materials mined outside of the area. .

<doc id="1164914" wikidata="Q7796332" url="?curid=1164914" title="Thornbury Castle">
<text>Thornbury Castle is a Tudor castle in the town of Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, England, erected next to the parish church of St Mary. Construction was begun in 1511 as a further residence for Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1478–1521), of Stafford Castle in Staffordshire. It is not a true military fortress but rather an early example of a Tudor country house, with minimal defensive attributes. As at Richmond Palace in Surrey, the main ranges of Thornbury framed courts, of which the symmetrical entrance range, with central gatehouse and octagonal corner towers, survives, together with two less regular side ranges with many irregular projecting features and towers. It is now a Grade I listed building that is operated as a hotel.

==History==
The site was occupied by a manor house in 930; Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford &amp; Earl of Pembroke, died there in 1495. Part of the original plans for a very grand residence were &quot;well advanced&quot;, with a licence to crenellate being granted in 1508, before the 3rd Duke of Buckingham was beheaded for treason in 1521, by order of King Henry VIII.

Following the 3rd Duke&#x27;s death, Thornbury was confiscated by Henry, who stayed there for ten days in August 1535 with Queen Anne Boleyn. In 1554 Queen Mary, who had visited Thornbury in 1525, granted the castle and manor to Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford. Following the Civil War, the castle fell into disrepair, but was renovated in 1824 by the Howard family.

==Today==
The castle is now a 26-room luxury hotel and restaurant, and a venue for weddings. Between 1966 and 1986 the castle was operated as one of the UK&#x27;s top restaurants by Kenneth Bell with staff including food writer Nigel Slater and MasterChef New Zealand judge Simon Gault early in their culinary careers.

A report in March 2022 indicated that all of the bedrooms and suites of the hotel had been refurbished. Since November 2021, the property had been a member of Relais &amp; Châteaux.

==Locomotive==
There was a GWR Castle class 4-6-0 locomotive in preservation named 7027 &quot;Thornbury Castle&quot;. In August 2022 the future of &quot;Thornbury Castle&quot; was called into question when the Great Western Society&#x27;s &quot;4709 Group&quot; bought the locomotive with the intention of donating the boiler to its project to re-create a GWR 4700 Class. Thornbury Castle&#x27;s chassis and other components were to be used to recreate a GWR Star class locomotive.

<doc id="1164930" wikidata="Q962365" url="?curid=1164930" title="Precision (computer science)">
<text>In computer science, the precision of a numerical quantity is a measure of the detail in which the quantity is expressed. This is usually measured in bits, but sometimes in decimal digits. It is related to precision in mathematics, which describes the number of digits that are used to express a value.

Some of the standardized precision formats are:
* Half-precision floating-point format
* Single-precision floating-point format
* Double-precision floating-point format
* Quadruple-precision floating-point format
* Octuple-precision floating-point format

Of these, octuple-precision format is rarely used. The single- and double-precision formats are most widely used and supported on nearly all platforms. The use of half-precision format and minifloat formats has been increasing especially in the field of machine learning since many machine learning algorithms are inherently error-tolerant.

==Rounding errors==
Precision is often the source of rounding errors in computation. The number of bits used to store a number will often cause some loss of accuracy. An example would be to store &quot;sin(0.1)&quot; in IEEE single-precision floating point standard. The error is then often magnified as subsequent computations are made using the data (although it can also be reduced).

* Arbitrary-precision arithmetic
* Extended precision
* Granularity
* IEEE754 (IEEE floating point standard)

<text>The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry. The kernel, device drivers, services, Security Accounts Manager, and user interfaces can all use the registry. The registry also allows access to counters for profiling system performance.

In other words, the registry or Windows Registry contains information, settings, options, and other values for programs and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. For example, when a program is installed, a new subkey containing settings such as a program&#x27;s location, its version, and how to start the program, are all added to the Windows Registry.

When introduced with Windows 3.1, the Windows Registry primarily stored configuration information for COM-based components. Windows 95 and Windows NT extended its use to rationalize and centralize the information in the profusion of INI files, which held the configurations for individual programs, and were stored at various locations. It is not a requirement for Windows applications to use the Windows Registry. For example, .NET Framework applications use XML files for configuration, while portable applications usually keep their configuration files with their executables.

== Rationale ==
Prior to the Windows Registry, .INI files stored each program&#x27;s settings as a text file or binary file, often located in a shared location that did not provide user-specific settings in a multi-user scenario. By contrast, the Windows Registry stores all application settings in one logical repository (but also in a number of discrete files) and in a standardized form. According to Microsoft, this offers several advantages over .INI files. Since file parsing is done much more efficiently with a binary format, it may be read from or written to more quickly than a text INI file. Furthermore, strongly typed data can be stored in the registry, as opposed to the text information stored in .INI files. This is a benefit when editing keys manually using codice_1, the built-in Windows Registry Editor. Because user-based registry settings are loaded from a user-specific path rather than from a read-only system location, the registry allows multiple users to share the same machine, and also allows programs to work for less privileged users. Backup and restoration is also simplified as the registry can be accessed over a network connection for remote management/support, including from scripts, using the standard set of APIs, as long as the Remote Registry service is running and firewall rules permit this.

Because the registry is a database, it offers improved system integrity with features such as atomic updates. If two processes attempt to update the same registry value at the same time, one process&#x27;s change will precede the other&#x27;s and the overall consistency of the data will be maintained. Where changes are made to .INI files, such race conditions can result in inconsistent data that does not match either attempted update. Windows Vista and later operating systems provide transactional updates to the registry by means of the Kernel Transaction Manager, extending the atomicity guarantees across multiple key or value changes with traditional commit–abort semantics. (Note however that NTFS provides such support for the file system as well, so the same guarantees could, in theory, be obtained with traditional configuration files.)

== Structure of Registry Key==

=== Keys and values ===
The registry contains two basic elements: keys and values. Registry &quot;keys&quot; are container objects similar to folders. Registry &quot;values&quot; are non-container objects similar to files. Keys may contain values and subkeys. Keys are referenced with a syntax similar to Windows&#x27; path names, using backslashes to indicate levels of hierarchy. Keys must have a case insensitive name without backslashes.

The hierarchy of registry keys can only be accessed from a known root key handle (which is anonymous but whose effective value is a constant numeric handle) that is mapped to the content of a registry key preloaded by the kernel from a stored &quot;hive&quot;, or to the content of a subkey within another root key, or mapped to a registered service or DLL that provides access to its contained subkeys and values.

E.g. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows refers to the subkey &quot;Windows&quot; of the subkey &quot;Microsoft&quot; of the subkey &quot;Software&quot; of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root key.

There are seven predefined root keys, traditionally named according to their constant handles defined in the Win32 API, or by synonymous abbreviations (depending on applications):
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKLM
* HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG or HKCC
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT or HKCR
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKCU
* HKEY_USERS or HKU
* HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA (only in Windows NT, but invisible in the Windows Registry Editor)
* HKEY_DYN_DATA (only in Windows 9x, and visible in the Windows Registry Editor)

Like other files and services in Windows, all registry keys may be restricted by access control lists (ACLs), depending on user privileges, or on security tokens acquired by applications, or on system security policies enforced by the system (these restrictions may be predefined by the system itself, and configured by local system administrators or by domain administrators). Different users, programs, services or remote systems may only see some parts of the hierarchy or distinct hierarchies from the same root keys.

Registry &quot;values&quot; are name/data pairs stored within keys. Registry values are referenced separately from registry keys. Each registry value stored in a registry key has a unique name whose letter case is not significant. The Windows API functions that query and manipulate registry values take value names separately from the key path or handle that identifies the parent key. Registry values may contain backslashes in their names, but doing so makes them difficult to distinguish from their key paths when using some legacy Windows Registry API functions (whose usage is deprecated in Win32).

The terminology is somewhat misleading, as each registry key is similar to an associative array, where standard terminology would refer to the name part of each registry value as a &quot;key&quot;. The terms are a holdout from the 16-bit registry in Windows 3, in which registry keys could not contain arbitrary name/data pairs, but rather contained only one unnamed value (which had to be a string). In this sense, the Windows 3 registry was like a single associative array, in which the keys (in the sense of both &#x27;registry key&#x27; and &#x27;associative array key&#x27;) formed a hierarchy, and the registry values were all strings. When the 32-bit registry was created, so was the additional capability of creating multiple named values per key, and the meanings of the names were somewhat distorted. For compatibility with the previous behavior, each registry key may have a &quot;default&quot; value, whose name is the empty string.

Each value can store arbitrary data with variable length and encoding, but which is associated with a symbolic type (defined as a numeric constant) defining how to parse this data. The standard types are:

=== Root keys ===
The keys at the root level of the hierarchical database are generally named by their Windows API definitions, which all begin with &quot;HKEY&quot;. They are frequently abbreviated to a three- or four-letter short name starting with &quot;HK&quot; (e.g. HKCU and HKLM). Technically, they are predefined handles (with known constant values) to specific keys that are either maintained in memory, or stored in hive files stored in the local filesystem and loaded by the system kernel at boot time and then shared (with various access rights) between all processes running on the local system, or loaded and mapped in all processes started in a user session when the user logs on the system.

The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (local machine-specific configuration data) and HKEY_CURRENT_USER (user-specific configuration data) nodes have a similar structure to each other; user applications typically look up their settings by first checking for them in &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Vendor&#x27;s name\Application&#x27;s name\Version\Setting name&quot;, and if the setting is not found, look instead in the same location under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key. However, the converse may apply for administrator-enforced policy settings where HKLM may take precedence over HKCU. The Windows Logo Program has specific requirements for where different types of user data may be stored, and that the concept of least privilege be followed so that administrator-level access is not required to use an application.

====HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)====
Abbreviated HKLM, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE stores settings that are specific to the local computer.

The key located by HKLM is actually not stored on disk, but maintained in memory by the system kernel in order to map all the other subkeys. Applications cannot create any additional subkeys. On Windows NT, this key contains four subkeys, &quot;SAM&quot;, &quot;SECURITY&quot;, &quot;SYSTEM&quot;, and &quot;SOFTWARE&quot;, that are loaded at boot time within their respective files located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\config\ folder. A fifth subkey, &quot;HARDWARE&quot;, is volatile and is created dynamically, and as such is not stored in a file (it exposes a view of all the currently detected Plug-and-Play devices). On Windows Vista and above, a sixth and seventh subkey, &quot;COMPONENTS&quot; and &quot;BCD&quot;, are mapped in memory by the kernel on-demand and loaded from %SystemRoot%\System32\config\COMPONENTS or from boot configuration data, \boot\BCD on the system partition.

* The &quot;HKLM\SAM&quot; key usually appears as empty for most users (unless they are granted access by administrators of the local system or administrators of domains managing the local system). It is used to reference all &quot;Security Accounts Manager&quot; (SAM) databases for all domains into which the local system has been administratively authorized or configured (including the local domain of the running system, whose SAM database is stored in a subkey also named &quot;SAM&quot;: other subkeys will be created as needed, one for each supplementary domain). Each SAM database contains all builtin accounts (mostly group aliases) and configured accounts (users, groups and their aliases, including guest accounts and administrator accounts) created and configured on the respective domain, for each account in that domain, it notably contains the user name which can be used to log on that domain, the internal unique user identifier in the domain, a cryptographic hash of each user&#x27;s password for each enabled authentication protocol, the location of storage of their user registry hive, various status flags (for example if the account can be enumerated and be visible in the logon prompt screen), and the list of domains (including the local domain) into which the account was configured.
* The &quot;HKLM\SECURITY&quot; key usually appears empty for most users (unless they are granted access by users with administrative privileges) and is linked to the Security database of the domain into which the current user is logged on (if the user is logged on the local system domain, this key will be linked to the registry hive stored by the local machine and managed by local system administrators or by the builtin &quot;System&quot; account and Windows installers). The kernel will access it to read and enforce the security policy applicable to the current user and all applications or operations executed by this user. It also contains a &quot;SAM&quot; subkey which is dynamically linked to the SAM database of the domain onto which the current user is logged on.
* The &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM&quot; key is normally only writable by users with administrative privileges on the local system. It contains information about the Windows system setup, data for the secure random number generator (RNG), the list of currently mounted devices containing a filesystem, several numbered &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\Control Sets&quot; containing alternative configurations for system hardware drivers and services running on the local system (including the currently used one and a backup), a &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\Select&quot; subkey containing the status of these Control Sets, and a &quot;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet&quot; which is dynamically linked at boot time to the Control Set which is currently used on the local system. Each configured Control Set contains:
** an &quot;Enum&quot; subkey enumerating all known Plug-and-Play devices and associating them with installed system drivers (and storing the device-specific configurations of these drivers),
** a &quot;Services&quot; subkey listing all installed system drivers (with non device-specific configuration, and the enumeration of devices for which they are instantiated) and all programs running as services (how and when they can be automatically started),
** a &quot;Control&quot; subkey organizing the various hardware drivers and programs running as services and all other system-wide configuration,
** a &quot;Hardware Profiles&quot; subkey enumerating the various profiles that have been tuned (each one with &quot;System&quot; or &quot;Software&quot; settings used to modify the default profile, either in system drivers and services or in the applications) as well as the &quot;Hardware Profiles\Current&quot; subkey which is dynamically linked to one of these profiles.
* The &quot;HKLM\SOFTWARE&quot; subkey contains software and Windows settings (in the default hardware profile). It is mostly modified by application and system installers. It is organized by software vendor (with a subkey for each), but also contains a &quot;Windows&quot; subkey for some settings of the Windows user interface, a &quot;Classes&quot; subkey containing all registered associations from file extensions, MIME types, Object Classes IDs and interfaces IDs (for OLE, COM/DCOM and ActiveX), to the installed applications or DLLs that may be handling these types on the local machine (however these associations are configurable for each user, see below), and a &quot;Policies&quot; subkey (also organized by vendor) for enforcing general usage policies on applications and system services (including the central certificates store used for authenticating, authorizing or disallowing remote systems or services running outside the local network domain).
* The &quot;HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node&quot; key is used by 32-bit applications on a 64-bit Windows OS, and is equivalent to but separate from &quot;HKLM\SOFTWARE&quot;. The key path is transparently presented to 32-bit applications by WoW64 as HKLM\SOFTWARE (in a similar way that 64-bit applications see %SystemRoot%\Syswow64 as %SystemRoot%\System32)

====HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)====
:Abbreviated HKCR, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT contains information about registered applications, such as file associations and OLE Object Class IDs, tying them to the applications used to handle these items. On Windows 2000 and above, HKCR is a compilation of user-based HKCU\Software\Classes and machine-based HKLM\Software\Classes. If a given value exists in both of the subkeys above, the one in HKCU\Software\Classes takes precedence. The design allows for either machine- or user-specific registration of COM objects.

====HKEY_USERS (HKU)====
:Abbreviated HKU, HKEY_USERS contains subkeys corresponding to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys for each user profile actively loaded on the machine, though user hives are usually only loaded for currently logged-in users.

====HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)====
:Abbreviated HKCU, HKEY_CURRENT_USER stores settings that are specific to the currently logged-in user. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER key is a link to the subkey of HKEY_USERS that corresponds to the user; the same information is accessible in both locations. The specific subkey referenced is &quot;(HKU)\(SID)\...&quot; where (SID) corresponds to the Windows SID; if the &quot;(HKCU)&quot; key has the following suffix &quot;(HKCU)\Software\Classes\...&quot; then it corresponds to &quot;(HKU)\(SID)_CLASSES\...&quot; i.e. the suffix string &quot;_CLASSES&quot; is appended to the (SID).

:On Windows NT systems, each user&#x27;s settings are stored in their own files called NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT inside their own Documents and Settings subfolder (or their own Users sub folder in Windows Vista and above). Settings in this hive follow users with a roaming profile from machine to machine.

====HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA====
:This key provides runtime information into performance data provided by either the NT kernel itself, or running system drivers, programs and services that provide performance data. This key is not stored in any hive and not displayed in the Registry Editor, but it is visible through the registry functions in the Windows API, or in a simplified view via the Performance tab of the Task Manager (only for a few performance data on the local system) or via more advanced control panels (such as the Performances Monitor or the Performances Analyzer which allows collecting and logging these data, including from remote systems).

====HKEY_DYN_DATA====
:This key is used only in Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME. It contains information about hardware devices, including Plug and Play and network performance statistics. The information in this hive is also not stored on the hard drive; the Plug and Play information is gathered and configured at startup and is stored in memory.

=== Hives ===
Even though the registry presents itself as an integrated hierarchical database, branches of the registry are actually stored in a number of disk files called &quot;hives&quot;. (The word hive constitutes an in-joke.)

Some hives are volatile and are not stored on disk at all. An example of this is the hive of the branch starting at HKLM\HARDWARE. This hive records information about system hardware and is created each time the system boots and performs hardware detection.

Individual settings for users on a system are stored in a hive (disk file) per user. During user login, the system loads the user hive under the HKEY_USERS key and sets the HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) symbolic reference to point to the current user. This allows applications to store/retrieve settings for the current user implicitly under the HKCU key.

Not all hives are loaded at any one time. At boot time, only a minimal set of hives are loaded, and after that, hives are loaded as the operating system initializes and as users log in or whenever a hive is explicitly loaded by an application.

=== File locations ===
The registry is physically stored in several files, which are generally obfuscated from the user-mode APIs used to manipulate the data inside the registry. Depending upon the version of Windows, there will be different files and different locations for these files, but they are all on the local machine. The location for system registry files in Windows NT is codice_2; the user-specific HKEY_CURRENT_USER user registry hive is stored in codice_3 inside the user profile. There is one of these per user; if a user has a roaming profile, then this file will be copied to and from a server at logout and login respectively. A second user-specific registry file named UsrClass.dat contains COM registry entries and does not roam by default.

==== Windows NT ====
Windows NT systems store the registry in a binary file format which can be exported, loaded and unloaded by the Registry Editor in these operating systems. The following system registry files are stored in codice_2:
* codice_5 – HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM
* codice_6 – HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY
* codice_7 – HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
* codice_8 – HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
* codice_9 – HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT
* codice_10 – Not associated with a hive. Used only when upgrading operating systems.

The following file is stored in each user&#x27;s profile folder:
* codice_11 – HKEY_USERS\&lt;User SID&gt; (linked to by HKEY_CURRENT_USER)

For Windows 2000, Server 2003 and Windows XP, the following additional user-specific file is used for file associations and COM information:
* codice_12 (path is localized) – HKEY_USERS\&lt;User SID&gt;_Classes (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes)
For Windows Vista and later, the path was changed to:
* codice_13 (path is not localized) alias codice_14 – HKEY_USERS\&lt;User SID&gt;_Classes (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes)

Windows 2000 keeps an alternate copy of the registry hives (.ALT) and attempts to switch to it when corruption is detected. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not maintain a codice_15 hive because NTLDR on those versions of Windows can process the codice_16 file to bring up to date a System hive that has become inconsistent during a shutdown or crash. In addition, the codice_17 folder contains a copy of the system&#x27;s registry hives that were created after installation and the first successful startup of Windows.

Each registry data file has an associated file with a &quot;.log&quot; extension that acts as a transaction log that is used to ensure that any interrupted updates can be completed upon next startup. Internally, Registry files are split into 4 kB &quot;bins&quot; that contain collections of &quot;cells&quot;.

==== Windows 9x ====
The registry files are stored in the codice_18 directory under the names codice_19 and codice_20 with the addition of codice_21 in Windows ME. Also, each user profile (if profiles are enabled) has its own codice_19 file which is located in the user&#x27;s profile directory in codice_23.

==== Windows 3.11 ====
The only registry file is called codice_24 and it is stored in the codice_18 directory.

==== Windows 10 Mobile ====
To access the registry files, the device needs to be set in a special mode using either: 

* WpInternals (Put the device into flash mode.)
* InterOp Tools (Mount the MainOS Partition with MTP.)

If any of the above methods worked, the device&#x27;s registry files can be found in the following location:
 {Phone}\EFIESP\Windows\System32\config

== Editing ==

=== Registry editors ===

The registry contains important configuration information for the operating system, for installed applications as well as individual settings for each user and application. A careless change to the operating system configuration in the registry could cause irreversible damage, so it is usually only installer programs which perform changes to the registry database during installation/configuration and removal. If a user wants to edit the registry manually, Microsoft recommends that a backup of the registry be performed before the change. When a program is removed from control panel, it may not be completely removed and, in case of errors or glitches caused by references to missing programs, the user might have to manually check inside directories such as program files. After this, the user might need to manually remove any reference to the uninstalled program in the registry. This is usually done by using RegEdit.exe. Editing the registry is sometimes necessary when working around Windows-specific issues e.g. problems when logging onto a domain can be resolved by editing the registry.

Windows Registry can be edited manually using programs such as RegEdit.exe, although these tools do not expose some of the registry&#x27;s metadata such as the last modified date.

The registry editor for the 3.1/95 series of operating systems is RegEdit.exe and for Windows NT it is RegEdt32.exe; the functionalities are merged in Windows XP. Optional and third-party tools similar to RegEdit.exe are available for many Windows CE versions.

Registry Editor allows users to perform the following functions:
* Creating, manipulating, renaming and deleting registry keys, subkeys, values and value data
* Importing and exporting .codice_26 files, exporting data in the binary hive format
* Loading, manipulating and unloading registry hive format files (Windows NT systems only)
* Setting permissions based on ACLs (Windows NT systems only)
* Bookmarking user-selected registry keys as Favorites
* Finding particular strings in key names, value names and value data
* Remotely editing the registry on another networked computer

=== codice_27 files ===
codice_27 files (also known as Registration entries) are text-based human-readable files for exporting and importing portions of the registry using an INI-based syntax. On Windows 2000 and later, they contain the string &quot;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00&quot; at the beginning, while on Windows 9x and NT 4.0 systems, they contain the string &quot;REGEDIT4&quot;. Windows 2000 and later REG files are Unicode-based, while on Windows 9x and NT 4.0 systems, they are ANSI-based. Windows 9x format codice_27 files are compatible with Windows 2000 and later. The Registry Editor on Windows on these systems also supports exporting codice_27 files in Windows 9x/NT format. Data is stored in codice_27 files using the following syntax:

[&lt;Hive name&gt;\&lt;Key name&gt;\&lt;Subkey name&gt;]
&quot;Value name&quot;=&lt;Value type&gt;:&lt;Value data&gt;
The Default Value of a key can be edited by using &quot;@&quot; instead of &quot;Value Name&quot;:

[&lt;Hive name&gt;\&lt;Key name&gt;\&lt;Subkey name&gt;]
@=&lt;Value type&gt;:&lt;Value data&gt;
String values do not require a &lt;Value type&gt; (see example), but backslashes (&#x27;\&#x27;) need to be written as a double-backslash (&#x27;\\&#x27;), and quotes (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;) as backslash-quote (&#x27;\&quot;&#x27;).

For example, to add the values &quot;Value A&quot;, &quot;Value B&quot;, &quot;Value C&quot;, &quot;Value D&quot;, &quot;Value E&quot;, &quot;Value F&quot;, &quot;Value G&quot;, &quot;Value H&quot;, &quot;Value I&quot;, &quot;Value J&quot;, &quot;Value K&quot;, &quot;Value L&quot;, and &quot;Value M&quot; to the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Foobar key:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Foobar]
&quot;Value A&quot;=&quot;&lt;String value data with escape characters&gt;&quot;
&quot;Value B&quot;=hex:&lt;Binary data (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values)&gt;
&quot;Value C&quot;=dword:&lt;DWORD value integer&gt;
&quot;Value D&quot;=hex(0):&lt;REG_NONE (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values)&gt;
&quot;Value E&quot;=hex(1):&lt;REG_SZ (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values representing a UTF-16LE NUL-terminated string)&gt;
&quot;Value F&quot;=hex(2):&lt;Expandable string value data (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values representing a UTF-16LE NUL-terminated string)&gt;
&quot;Value G&quot;=hex(3):&lt;Binary data (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values)&gt; ; equal to &quot;Value B&quot;
&quot;Value H&quot;=hex(4):&lt;DWORD value (as comma-delimited list of 4 hexadecimal values, in little endian byte order)&gt;
&quot;Value I&quot;=hex(5):&lt;DWORD value (as comma-delimited list of 4 hexadecimal values, in big endian byte order)&gt;
&quot;Value J&quot;=hex(7):&lt;Multi-string value data (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values representing UTF-16LE NUL-terminated strings)&gt;
&quot;Value K&quot;=hex(8):&lt;REG_RESOURCE_LIST (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values)&gt;
&quot;Value L&quot;=hex(a):&lt;REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST (as comma-delimited list of hexadecimal values)&gt;
&quot;Value M&quot;=hex(b):&lt;QWORD value (as comma-delimited list of 8 hexadecimal values, in little endian byte order)&gt;

Data from codice_27 files can be added/merged with the registry by double-clicking these files or using the /s switch in the command line. codice_26 files can also be used to remove registry data.

To remove a key (and all subkeys, values and data), the key name must be preceded by a minus sign (&quot;-&quot;).

For example, to remove the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Foobar key (and all subkeys, values and data),

[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Foobar]
To remove a value (and its data), the values to be removed must have a minus sign (&quot;-&quot;) after the equal sign (&quot;=&quot;).

For example, to remove only the &quot;Value A&quot; and &quot;Value B&quot; values (and their data) from the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Foobar key:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Foobar]
&quot;Value A&quot;=-
&quot;Value B&quot;=-
To remove only the Default value of the key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Foobar (and its data):

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Foobar]


Lines beginning with a semicolon are considered comments:

; This is a comment. This can be placed in any part of a .reg file
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Foobar]
&quot;Value&quot;=&quot;Example string&quot;
=== Group policies ===

Windows group policies can change registry keys for a number of machines or individual users based on policies. When a policy first takes effect for a machine or for an individual user of a machine, the registry settings specified as part of the policy are applied to the machine or user settings.

Windows will also look for updated policies and apply them periodically, typically every 90 minutes.

Through its &quot;scope&quot; a policy defines to which machines and users the policy is to be applied. Whether a machine or user is within the scope of a policy or not is defined by a set of rules which can filter on the location of the machine or user account in organizational directory, specific users or machine accounts or security groups. More advanced rules can be set up using Windows Management Instrumentation expressions. Such rules can filter on properties such as computer vendor name, CPU architecture, installed software, or networks connected to.

For instance, the administrator can create a policy with one set of registry settings for machines in the accounting department and policy with another (lock-down) set of registry settings for kiosk terminals in the visitors area. When a machine is moved from one scope to another (e.g., changing its name or moving it to another organizational unit), the correct policy is automatically applied. When a policy is changed it is automatically re-applied to all machines currently in its scope.

The policy is edited through a number of administrative templates which provides a user interface for picking and changing settings. The set of administrative templates is extensible and software packages which support such remote administration can register their own templates.

=== Command line editing ===
The registry can be manipulated in a number of ways from the command line. The codice_34 and codice_35 utility tools are included in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Alternative locations for legacy versions of Windows include the Resource Kit CDs or the original Installation CD of Windows.

Also, a codice_27 file can be imported from the command line with the following command:

 RegEdit.exe /s &quot;file&quot;

The /s means the file will be &quot;silent merged&quot; to the registry. If the codice_37 parameter is omitted the user will be asked to confirm the operation. In Windows 98, Windows 95 and at least some configurations of Windows XP the codice_37 switch also causes codice_39 to ignore the setting in the registry that allows administrators to disable it. When using the codice_37 switch codice_39 does not return an appropriate return code if the operation fails, unlike codice_34 which does.

 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot;

exports the whole registry in V5 format to a UNICODE codice_27 file, while any of

 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT[\&lt;key&gt;]
 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot; HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG[\&lt;key&gt;]
 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot; HKEY_CURRENT_USER[\&lt;key&gt;]
 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE[\&lt;key&gt;]
 RegEdit.exe /e &quot;file&quot; HKEY_USERS[\&lt;key&gt;]

export the specified (sub)key (which has to be enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces) only.

 RegEdit.exe /a &quot;file&quot;

exports the whole registry in V4 format to an ANSI codice_27 file.

 RegEdit.exe /a &quot;file&quot; &quot;&lt;key&gt;&quot;

exports the specified (sub)key (which has to be enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces) only.

It is also possible to use codice_34. Here is a sample to display the value of the registry value Version:

Reg.exe QUERY HKLM\Software\Microsoft\ResKit /v Version

Other command line options include a VBScript or JScript together with CScript, WMI or codice_46 and Windows PowerShell.

Registry permissions can be manipulated through the command line using codice_35 and the codice_48 tool. For example, the permissions on the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE key can be displayed using:
SubInACL.exe /keyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE /display
=== PowerShell commands and scripts ===
Windows PowerShell comes with a registry provider which presents the registry as a location type similar to the file system. The same commands used to manipulate files and directories in the file system can be used to manipulate keys and values of the registry.

Also like the file system, PowerShell uses the concept of a &quot;current location&quot; which defines the context on which commands by default operate. The codice_49 (also available through the aliases codice_50, codice_51 or codice_52) retrieves the child keys of the current location. By using the codice_53 (or the alias codice_54) command the user can change the current location to another key of the registry. Commands which rename items, remove items, create new items or set content of items or properties can be used to rename keys, remove keys or entire sub-trees or change values.

Through PowerShell scripts files, an administrator can prepare scripts which, when executed, make changes to the registry. Such scripts can be distributed to administrators who can execute them on individual machines. The PowerShell Registry provider supports transactions, i.e. multiple changes to the registry can be bundled into a single atomic transaction. An atomic transaction ensures that either all of the changes are committed to the database, or if the script fails, none of the changes are committed to the database.

=== Programs or scripts ===
The registry can be edited through the APIs of the Advanced Windows 32 Base API Library (advapi32.dll). List of registry API functions:

Many programming languages offer built-in runtime library functions or classes that wrap the underlying Windows APIs and thereby enable programs to store settings in the registry (e.g. codice_55 in VB.NET and C#, or codice_56 in Delphi and Free Pascal). COM-enabled applications like Visual Basic 6 can use the WSH codice_57 object. Another way is to use the Windows Resource Kit Tool, codice_34 by executing it from code, although this is considered poor programming practice.

Similarly, scripting languages such as Perl (with codice_59), Python (with winreg), TCL (which comes bundled with the registry package), Windows Powershell and Windows Scripting Host also enable registry editing from scripts.

=== Offline editing ===
The offreg.dll available from the Windows Driver Kit offers a set of APIs for the creation and manipulation of currently not loaded registry hives similar to those provided by advapi32.dll.

It is also possible to edit the registry (hives) of an offline system from Windows PE or Linux (in the latter case using open source tools).

=== COM self-registration ===
Prior to the introduction of registration-free COM, developers were encouraged to add initialization code to in-process and out-of-process binaries to perform the registry configuration required for that object to work. For in-process binaries such as .DLL and .OCX files, the modules typically exported a function called DllInstall() that could be called by installation programs or invoked manually with utilities like Regsvr32.exe; out-of-process binaries typically support the commandline arguments /Regserver and /Unregserver that created or deleted the required registry settings. COM applications that break because of DLL Hell issues can commonly be repaired with RegSvr32.exe or the /RegServer switch without having to re-invoke installation programs.

=== Advanced functionality ===
Windows exposes APIs that allows user-mode applications to register to receive a notification event if a particular registry key is changed. APIs are also available to allow kernel-mode applications to filter and modify registry calls made by other applications.

Windows also supports remote access to the registry of another computer via the codice_60 function if the Remote Registry service is running, correctly configured and its network traffic is not firewalled.

== Security ==
Each key in the registry of Windows NT versions can have an associated security descriptor. The security descriptor contains an access control list (ACL) that describes which user groups or individual users are granted or denied access permissions. The set of registry permissions include 10 rights/permissions which can be explicitly allowed or denied to a user or a group of users.

As with other securable objects in the operating system, individual access control entries (ACE) on the security descriptor can be explicit or inherited from a parent object.

Windows Resource Protection is a feature of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows that uses security to deny Administrators and the system WRITE access to some sensitive keys to protect the integrity of the system from malware and accidental modification.

Special ACEs on the security descriptor can also implement mandatory integrity control for the registry key and subkeys. A process running at a lower integrity level cannot write, change or delete a registry key/value, even if the account of the process has otherwise been granted access through the ACL. For instance, Internet Explorer running in Protected Mode can &quot;read&quot; medium and low integrity registry keys/values of the currently logged on user, but it can only modify low integrity keys.

Outside security, registry keys cannot be deleted or edited due to other causes. Registry keys containing NUL characters cannot be deleted with standard registry editors and require a special utility for deletion, such as RegDelNull.

== Backups and recovery ==
Different editions of Windows have supported a number of different methods to back up and restore the registry over the years, some of which are now deprecated:
* System Restore can back up the registry and restore it as long as Windows is bootable, or from the Windows Recovery Environment (starting with Windows Vista).
* NTBackup can back up the registry as part of the &quot;System State&quot; and restore it. Automated System Recovery in Windows XP can also restore the registry.
* On Windows NT, the &quot;Last Known Good Configuration&quot; option in startup menu relinks the codice_61 key, which stores hardware and device driver information.
* Windows 98 and Windows ME include command line (Scanreg.exe) and GUI (Scanregw.exe) registry checker tools to check and fix the integrity of the registry, create up to five automatic regular backups by default and restore them manually or whenever corruption is detected. The registry checker tool backs up the registry, by default, to codice_62 Scanreg.exe can also run from MS-DOS.
* The Windows 95 CD-ROM included an Emergency Recovery Utility (ERU.exe) and a Configuration Backup Tool (Cfgback.exe) to back up and restore the registry. Additionally Windows 95 backs up the registry to the files system.da0 and user.da0 on every successful boot.
* Windows NT 4.0 included codice_63, a utility to back up and restore the entire registry.
* Windows 2000 Resource Kit contained an unsupported pair of utilities called Regback.exe and RegRest.exe for backup and recovery of the registry.
* Periodic automatic backups of the registry are now disabled by default on Windows 10 May 2019 Update (version 1903). Microsoft recommends System Restore be used instead.

== Policy ==

=== Group policy ===
Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows use Group Policy to enforce registry settings through a registry-specific client extension in the Group Policy processing engine. Policy may be applied locally to a single computer using codice_64 or to multiple users and computers in a domain using codice_65.

=== Legacy systems ===
With Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows NT 4.0, administrators can use a special file to be merged into the registry, called a policy file (codice_66). The policy file allows administrators to prevent non-administrator users from changing registry settings like, for instance, the security level of Internet Explorer and the desktop background wallpaper. The policy file is primarily used in a business with a large number of computers where the business needs to be protected from rogue or careless users.

The default extension for the policy file is codice_67.
The policy file filters the settings it enforces by user and by group (a &quot;group&quot; is a defined set of users). To do that the policy file merges into the registry, preventing users from circumventing it by simply changing back the settings.
The policy file is usually distributed through a LAN, but can be placed on the local computer.

The policy file is created by a free tool by Microsoft that goes by the filename codice_68 for Windows 95/Windows 98 and with a computer management module for Windows NT. The editor requires administrative permissions to be run on systems that uses permissions.
The editor can also directly change the current registry settings of the local computer and if the remote registry service is installed and started on another computer it can also change the registry on that computer.
The policy editor loads the settings it can change from codice_69 files, of which one is included, that contains the settings the Windows shell provides. The codice_69 file is plain text and supports easy localisation by allowing all the strings to be stored in one place.

== Virtualization ==

=== INI file virtualization ===
Windows NT kernels support redirection of INI file-related APIs into a virtual file in a registry location such as HKEY_CURRENT_USER using a feature called &quot;InifileMapping&quot;. This functionality was introduced to allow legacy applications written for 16-bit versions of Windows to be able to run under Windows NT platforms on which the System folder is no longer considered an appropriate location for user-specific data or configuration. Non-compliant 32-bit applications can also be redirected in this manner, even though the feature was originally intended for 16-bit applications.

=== Registry virtualization ===
Windows Vista introduced limited registry virtualization, whereby poorly written applications that do not respect the principle of least privilege and instead try to write user data to a read-only system location (such as the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive), are silently redirected to a more appropriate location, without changing the application itself.

Similarly, application virtualization redirects all of an application&#x27;s invalid registry operations to a location such as a file. Used together with file virtualization, this allows applications to run on a machine without being installed on it.

Low integrity processes may also use registry virtualization. For example, Internet Explorer 7 or 8 running in &quot;Protected Mode&quot; on Windows Vista and above will automatically redirect registry writes by ActiveX controls to a sandboxed location in order to frustrate some classes of security exploits.

The Application Compatibility Toolkit provides shims that can transparently redirect HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT Registry operations to HKEY_CURRENT_USER to address &quot;LUA&quot; bugs that cause applications not to work for users with insufficient rights.

== Disadvantages ==
Critics labeled the registry in Windows 95 a single point of failure, because re-installation of the operating system was required if the registry became corrupt. However, Windows NT uses transaction logs to protect against corruption during updates. Current versions of Windows use two levels of log files to ensure integrity even in the case of power failure or similar catastrophic events during database updates. Even in the case of a non-recoverable error, Windows can repair or re-initialize damaged registry entries during system boot.

== Equivalents and alternatives ==

In Windows, use of the registry for storing program data is a matter of developer&#x27;s discretion. Microsoft provides programming interfaces for storing data in XML files (via MSXML) or database files (via SQL Server Compact) which developers can use instead. Developers are also free to use non-Microsoft alternatives or develop their own proprietary data stores.

In contrast to Windows Registry&#x27;s binary-based database model, some other operating systems use separate plain-text files for daemon and application configuration, but group these configurations together for ease of management.
* In Unix-like operating systems (including Linux) that follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, system-wide configuration files (information similar to what would appear in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Windows) are traditionally stored in files in codice_71 and its subdirectories, or sometimes in codice_72. Per-user information (information that would be roughly equivalent to that in HKEY_CURRENT_USER) is stored in hidden directories and files (that start with a period/full stop) within the user&#x27;s home directory. However XDG-compliant applications should refer to the environment variables defined in the Base Directory specification.
* In macOS, system-wide configuration files are typically stored in the codice_73 folder, whereas per-user configuration files are stored in the corresponding codice_74 folder in the user&#x27;s home directory, and configuration files set by the system are in codice_75. Within these respective directories, an application typically stores a property list file in the codice_76 sub-directory.
* RISC OS (not to be confused with &quot;MIPS RISC/os&quot;) uses directories for configuration data, which allows applications to be copied into application directories, as opposed to the separate installation process that typifies Windows applications; this approach is also used on the ROX Desktop for Linux. This directory-based configuration also makes it possible to use different versions of the same application, since the configuration is done &quot;on the fly&quot;. If one wishes to remove the application, it is possible to simply delete the folder belonging to the application. This will often not remove configuration settings which are stored independently from the application, usually within the computer&#x27;s !Boot structure, in !Boot.Choices or potentially anywhere on a network fileserver. It is possible to copy installed programs between computers running RISC OS by copying the application directories belonging to the programs, however some programs may require re-installing, e.g. when shared files are placed outside an application directory.
* IBM AIX (a Unix variant) uses a registry component called Object Data Manager (ODM). The ODM is used to store information about system and device configuration. An extensive set of tools and utilities provides users with means of extending, checking, correcting the ODM database. The ODM stores its information in several files, default location is codice_77.
* The GNOME desktop environment uses a registry-like interface called dconf for storing configuration settings for the desktop and applications.
* The Elektra Initiative provides alternative back-ends for various different text configuration files.
* While not an operating system, the Wine compatibility layer, which allows Windows software to run on a Unix-like system, also employs a Windows-like registry as text files in the WINEPREFIX folder: system.reg (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE), user.reg (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) and userdef.reg.

<text>The Race to Urga, later renamed A Pray by Blecht, is an unfinished musical adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;The Exception and the Rule&quot;.

Collaboration on the production was initiated in 1968, with Jerome Robbins asking John Guare to write the adaptation. Leonard Bernstein was to compose the music, with Stephen Sondheim onboard to write the lyrics. The new musical was announced to open at Lincoln Center in January 1969, but Robbins left the production during cast auditions, and the project folded. Bernstein re-used many themes from this work in &quot;Mass&quot; (1971), Arias and Barcarolles, and other works.

No cast album was produced, though a demo was recorded in 1968. Jerome Robbins returned to the show, still incomplete, as director and choreographer of an April 1987 workshop production at Lincoln Center.

==Synopsis==

While never produced, the play featured a story within a story structure, with the musical numbers being part of a television play of &quot;The Exception and the Rule&quot;. According to Sondheim&#x27;s book &quot;Look, I Made A Hat&quot;, &quot;The theatre would be a television studio and the play presented as a television play... The star of the TV play (intended to be Zero Mostel) would be white and the Guide and the Coolie would be black, and the growing paranoia of the star that the blacks were getting all the attention... would parallel the Merchant&#x27;s paranoia.&quot;

<text>Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira (May 3, 1910 – February 28, 1989) was a Brazilian lexicographer, philologist, translator, and writer, best known for editing the &quot;Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa&quot;, a major dictionary of the Portuguese language.

His family name was originally spelled Hollanda, but was changed to Holanda, presumably to follow the Portuguese spelling reform of 1943.

==Biography==
Aurélio was born in Passo de Camaragibe, Alagoas state, Brazil. In 1923 he moved to the state capital Maceió, where, at only 14 years of age, he gave private lessons of Portuguese language. One year later he became a first-grade teacher at the local high school Ginásio Primeiro de Março.

In 1936 obtained a law degree at the Recife Law School in Pernambuco, and in that same year he started teaching French and Portuguese grammar, as well as Brazilian and Portuguese literature, at the Alagoas State High School in Maceió. In 1937–1938 he also served as director of the Maceió City Public Library.

In 1938 he moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro, where he taught Brazilian and Portuguese Literature at elite secondary schools including the public Pedro II High School and the private Anglo-American High School.

It was in Rio that he has started his career as a writer, by publishing articles, tales and chronicles in the local press. Between 1939 and 1943, he was acting secretary of the magazine &quot;&quot;.

Aurélio started his career as a lexicographer in 1941, as a collaborator of the &quot;Pequeno Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa&quot;. In 1942 he published a book of short stories, &quot;Dois Mundos&quot; (&quot;Two Worlds&quot;), which earned him a prize by the prestigious Brazilian Literary Academy. In 1943 he collaborated with the &quot;Dicionário Enciclopédico&quot; sponsored by the Brazilian Book Institute. In 1945 he took part in the First Brazilian Writers Conference in São Paulo. Between 1944 and 1949 he was a member of the Brazilian Writers Association (Rio de Janeiro branch).

In 1945 he married Marina Baird, with whom he had two children – Aurélio and Maria Luísa – and five grandchildren.

Between 1947 and 1960, Aurélio authored various texts for the &quot;Conto da Semana&quot; (&quot;Weekly Tale&quot;) section of the newspaper &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot;. Starting in 1950 he also authored the column &quot;Enriqueça o Seu Vocabulário&quot; (&quot;Enrich Your Vocabulary&quot;) for the Brazilian edition of Reader&#x27;s Digest; these columns were later published as a book.

Between 1954 and 1955 he lectured Brazilian studies at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, on a grant by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.

He was elected a member of the Brazilian Literary Academy on May 4, 1961, and inaugurated on December 18, 1961, taking over seat number 30, formerly of Antônio Austregésilo.

Inspired by his love of the Portuguese language, he decided to produce his own dictionary. After several years of work, in 1975 he published the &quot;Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa&quot; which was for many decades &quot;the&quot; reference lexicon in Brazil – to the point that &quot;Aurélio&quot; and &quot;Aurelião&quot; (&quot;big Aurélio&quot;) became popular synonyms of dictionary. (It is said that his collaborators once proposed to add that entry to the dictionary, but Aurélio vetoed it.) This book went through dozens of reprints and revisions, and spawned several derivative editions.

Aurélio was also member of the , of the (the Brazilian section of PEN international), the , the , the , and the Hispanic Society of America.

<text>The Tarawera River is in the Bay of Plenty Region in the North Island of New Zealand.

It flows from Lake Tarawera, northeastwards across the northern flanks of the active volcano Mount Tarawera, and past the town of Kawerau before turning north, reaching the Bay of Plenty west of Edgecumbe.

The Tarawera Falls on the river are considered to be quite spectacular.
==Environmental issues==

The Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill, now owned by Norske Skog, has been discharging waste into the river since 1955. Local residents have erected signposts labelling the river as the &quot;Black Drain&quot; since the 1990s.

The dark colour is due to the presence of pollution from farms, sewage and stormwater but it is predominantly from pulp and paper mill effluent. As of 1997, pulp and paper mills were discharging over 160 million litres of industrial waste into the river per day. By 2006, the oxygen levels in the river had reached a level where fish could survive, however the water colour was still dark. Since 1998 the colour and light penetration (euphotic depth) have improved in the lower section of the river due to less pollution from the Tasman Mill.

In 2009, the mill gained permission to continue polluting the river for the next 25 years. In 2010, local iwi took a case to the High Court to shorten the 25 year water discharge permits issued under the Resource Management Act but the appeal was rejected.

==Geology==
The Tarawera River drains the north-eastern aspect of the Taupō Rift with its river mouth west of Matatā. The river commences at the north-east arm of Lake Tarawera with a mean outflow of , from effectively a watershed of the Ōkataina Caldera, with its risk of volcanic activity disrupting river flow. At this normal or less flow the river disappears underground into caves in the rhyolite lava flow just before the Tarawera Falls. It usually emerges about halfway up the full falls drop, but can with recent rain fully occupy the drop. There have been two known major floods following the breakdown of temporary volcanic material dams at the lake outlet.

The first, and larger, followed the 1314 ± 12 CE Kaharoa eruption. The present river start is where the Tapahoro lava flow, created by the 5526 ± 145 BP Whakatane eruption, runs into a 14,009 ± 155 BP Pokohu lava flow. The Tarawera River flows across this in a wide channel. The 1314 eruption blocked the outlet with a temporary dam up to above present outlet levels, which was subsequently eroded with a great flood that created a wide, and almost deep valley spillway at the start of the river. It seems the river during this flood overflowed to the east draining for a time through the Awiti Ravine, and back into the Tarawera River flood plain by the present Waiaute Stream that drains the eastern slopes of Mount Tarawera. However it also evacuated downstream from the lake at the terminus of the Pokohu lava flow the amphitheatre of the Tarawera Falls. The flood deposited large boulders up to in diameter for below the falls and up to to below the falls.

The lake outlet was blocked again after the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, and the lake level increased to a maximum of above its present level. This volcanic debris dam (the debris that blocked the outlet were not just from the eruption directly but included those washed down from a creek that runs into the lake by the outlet), first broke on 1 November 1904, with a main flood surge on 3 November 1904 which was assessed at a peak flow of . This flood resulted in the raising of the river bed (aggradation), and sedimentation problems to downstream of the lake.

<text>Multi-rate symmetric DSL (MSDSL or MDSL) is a proprietary, non-standardized symmetric digital subscriber line technology with a maximum distance of . It is capable of multiple transfer rates, as set by the Internet service provider, typically based on the service and/or price. Eight data rates are available, ranging from 160 kbit/s to 2.32 Mbit/s.

==Technology==
MSDSL uses either 2B1Q or carrierless amplitude phase modulation (CAP) transmission with a capacity of up to 2.32 Mbit/s. The bandwidth is generally split between a full E-carrier E1 payload (2.048 Mbit/s), with the remaining bandwidth accommodating up to three voice channels or two ISDN channels. Additional bandwidth is used for management purposes. Transmission over the single pair requires echo cancellation and adaptive equalizers in order to achieve the maximum range at a specific rate. For each user rate, the modem changes the 2B1Q or CAP transmission rate, employing different filters and equalizer settings. The modem&#x27;s adaptive setting is determined during its initial use, and continues constantly during operation.

<text>This is a list of historical coins and banknotes of [[Poland]].

==Before the 20th century==


==20th-century and interwar==
=== Coins ===
1924 - See Dziennik Ustaw 1924-045

==Post-WWII==
==1950-currency reform==
===Series of 1948===
The banknotes of the series of 1948 were designed by Polish painter and decorative artist Wacław Borowski. The introduction of these notes was part of the currency reform of 1950, so the banknotes had to be printed quickly and in secrecy; so printing works in Poland (PWPW), Czechoslovakia (STC), Hungary (Pénzjegynyomda), Sweden (Riksbankens Sedeltryckeri), and Canada (British American Bank Note Company Ltd.) were involved.

===Series of 1974===
The National Bank of Poland began to introduce banknotes with the faces of &quot;Great Poles&quot; and the series was first introduced on 16 December 1974 with the 500 Zloty note. As economical situations worsened, by the 1980s higher and higher denonimations worsened and in 1989, the 20000 was adopted which was equvialent to half of a wage of that time(65,000 Zloty). By the end of 1989, a commemorative note was released into circulation, the 200,000 Zloty banknote which is rather a numismatical product(which still has a huge price tag even today) than an actual banknote meant for everyday payments/transactions. In 1990, as wages were regulated to the actual value of the currency, new higher denonimation notes were released such as the 500,000 Zloty note which was worth 50 Dollars and then it was devalued to 30 dollars when a new exchange rate was finalized to prevent hyperinflation. At the end of 1993, new reworked editions of banknotes(50.000,100.000,500.000,1.000.000 and 2.000.000 Zloty) were released which also erased the old Polish People&#x27;s Republic name from the 50.000 and 100.000 Zloty banknotes in circulation. In 1994 they stopped printing old Zloty notes to later establish the Fourth Zloty by 1st January 1995. All of the banknotes together were withdrawn on 31st December 1996 and were no longer exchanged by 2010.

A lot of these banknotes that circulated from 1974 to 1988 were printed in several years.

<text>Pierre Renoir (; March 21, 1885 – March 11, 1952) was a French stage and film actor. He was the son of the impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and elder brother of the film director Jean Renoir. He is also noted for being the first actor to play Georges Simenon&#x27;s character Inspector Jules Maigret in
&quot;Night at the Crossroads&quot;, directed by his brother.

==Life and career==
Pierre Renoir was born on March 21, 1885, in Paris, at 18 rue Houdon, about a hundred meters from place Pigalle, to painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Aline Charigot. He was married to actress Véra Sergine from 1914 to 1925.

For his best remembered role, as Jėricho the ragman in &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (&quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot;, 1945), he was cast at short notice to replace the collaborator Robert Le Vigan; Jėricho&#x27;s scenes had to be reshot after Le Vigan fled. Renoir was briefly the director of the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée in Paris, taking over after the death of Louis Jouvet in 1951. Pierre Renoir&#x27;s son was the cinematographer Claude Renoir (1913–93)not to be confused with Pierre&#x27;s brother Claude Renoir, known as &#x27;Coco&#x27; (1901–69).

<text>Edward Lea (January 31, 1837 – January 1, 1863) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Galveston and died in the arms of his father, who was on the opposing side in the conflict.

==Biography==
Lea was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Army engineer Albert Miller Lea and Ellen Shoemaker. He entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis on October 2, 1851, graduating on June 9, 1855, with the rank of midshipman. Lea was employed in active service on various stations, receiving promotion to passed midshipman on April 15, 1858, to master on November 4, 1858, and to lieutenant on November 22, 1860.

Lea was serving aboard the , flagship of the East India Squadron, when the Civil War broke out in 1861. The ship was recalled, eventually arriving in Delaware Bay in December. Lea was soon reassigned to the , then attached to the Potomac Flotilla, but was soon reassigned in her to the Gulf Blockading Squadron, where he took part in operations leading to the capture of New Orleans in April 1862. Lea was subsequently promoted to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862. &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; pushed further up the Mississippi that July to engage enemy batteries around Vicksburg, and was then assigned to the blockade of Galveston, which she helped capture in October 1862 in the Battle of Galveston Harbor.

When Confederate forces retook Galveston on 1 January 1863, Lea, serving as the first officer (XO) of &quot;Harriet Lane&quot;, was wounded in the abdomen and side. He subsequently succumbed to his wounds in the arms of his father, who was serving as a major of artillery in the Confederate Army, and who had witnessed the capture of the &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; by the gunboat from shore, and had rushed to the ship to find his son dying.

Lea and his captain, Jonathan M. Wainwright were buried together at the Trinity Episcopal Cemetery in Galveston. After the war Wainwright was re-interred at the Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, but when a relative suggested that Lea&#x27;s remains be reburied next to his mother in the Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, Albert Lea refused, stating that his son would have preferred to remain where he had fallen in battle.

==Namesake==

The destroyer was named for him, as is Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Houston.

<doc id="1165004" wikidata="Q15030907" url="?curid=1165004" title="John Safran's Music Jamboree">
<text>John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree (or just Music Jamboree) was a light-hearted Australian music documentary television series, hosted by John Safran for SBS television. The program was produced by Richard Lowenstein, Selin Yaman and Ghost Pictures and directed by Craig Melville, Richard Lowenstein and a number of other directors under the production company Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions in association with SBS Independent. It screened in 2002, and consisted of sketches and outlandish public stunts, typical of Safran&#x27;s work. The series won two Australian Film Institute Awards; &quot;Best Comedy Series&quot; and &quot;Most Innovative Program Concept&quot;. SBS followed the series up with the similarly styled &quot;John Safran vs God&quot; in 2004.

An infamous stunt of the series was sneaking nine friends into an exclusive Melbourne nightclub by dressing them up as the masked American metal band, Slipknot. The producers arranged entry for the impostors by pretending to be an American management company over the phone.

Other stunts included disguising himself as well known entertainers such as Ozzy Osbourne and Prince to harass the public, sketch versions of music videos such as Eminem, the creation of &quot;Jew Town&quot;, a Jewish boy band to compete with Christian pop, and returning to Yeshivah College to pay homage to Kevin Bacon in &quot;Footloose&quot;. He also details his time in the hip-hop group Raspberry Cordial, and the related incident in which he met the Beastie Boys and the band&#x27;s former DJ attempted to steal his girlfriend at the time.

A regular segment on the series was &quot;The Music Mole&quot;. In this segment a person dressed in a large mole costume (much like a mascot) was interviewed by Safran. The person was reported to be an insider (i.e. a mole) in the music industry who would reveal little known, often controversial facts about both the Australian and international music industries.

<text>Val Müstair () is a municipality in the Engiadina Bassa/Val Müstair Region in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. It was formed on 1 January 2009 through the merger of Tschierv, Fuldera, Lü, Valchava, Santa Maria Val Müstair and Müstair.

==Demographics==
Val Müstair had a population (as of ) of .

==Geography==
The Val Müstair (German: &quot;Münstertal&quot;, ) is a mountain valley in the Swiss Alps. It connects the Fuorn Pass, () with the Italian province of South Tyrol and the Vinschgau ().

The Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair (&quot;monastery&quot;), a World Heritage Site, was probably founded by Charlemagne, sharing history with its neighbor, the Marienberg Abbey.

The most important villages in the Val Müstair are: Tschierv (), Valchava (), Sta. Maria (), Müstair () (all Swiss) and Taufers im Münstertal in South Tyrol. There are no other inhabited connected valleys, but the road over the Umbrail Pass (and the Stelvio Pass) is connected with Sta. Maria.

The largest part of the valley is part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden. A small part lies in the Italian province of South Tyrol. The border is located at approximately 1245 meter between Müstair (1247 meter) and Taufers im Münstertal (1240 meter).

The river in the valley is the Rom (&quot;Il Rom&quot; or &quot;Rombach&quot;).

== Naming convention ==
Contrary to the common notion, where the beginning of a valley is referred as the &quot;upper valley&quot; and the end as the &quot;lower valley&quot;, in Val Müstair these are referred to as &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; respectively. This is often reflected in location names.

For instance, the valley is traditionally divided into three thirds:
* Terzal d&#x27;Aint (inner third) with Tschierv, Fuldera and Lü
* Terzal d&#x27;Immez (middle third) with Valchava and Sta. Maria
* Terzal d&#x27;Oura (outer third) with Müstair
Incidentally, this division corresponds to the first three plateaus occurring on the Swiss part of the valley.

==Language==
The majority of the population in the new municipality speaks Romansh, with a large German speaking minority. The following table lists the historical language distribution of the formerly independent municipalities and also for the combined municipality:
==Heritage sites of national significance==

<doc id="1165018" wikidata="Q497688" url="?curid=1165018" title="Asin of Baekje">
<text>King Asin (died 405) (r. 392–405) was the seventeenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

== Background ==
Buyeo Abang was the eldest son of Baekje&#x27;s 15th ruler Chimnyu, and ascended to the throne after the death of Chimnyu&#x27;s brother, the 16th king Jinsa, of whom he is said to have killed.

== Reign ==
During his reign, Goguryeo forces under Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo steadily pushed into Baekje from the north. Asin appointed his maternal uncle Jin Mu as chief general and ordered him to attack Goguryeo repeatedly in the early 390s, but each attack was defeated. In 395, after a failed attack by Baekje, Goguryeo took Baekje&#x27;s territory around today&#x27;s northern Seoul.

Asin sought to strengthen Baekje&#x27;s position against Goguryeo, sending his son Jeonji to the Wa kingdom of Japan as a ward to cement Baekje&#x27;s alliance with that country in 397. In 398, according to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he constructed Ssanghyeon Castle to protect Baekje&#x27;s remaining territory north of the Han River. In 399, during another round of conscription for the battles against Goguryeo, many peasants are said to have fled to Silla. In 403 he attacked Silla. Historical records do not show any contacts with China during Asin&#x27;s rule.

== Death ==
Asin died during the year 405, and watched desperately as his once-powerful kingdom was falling slowly to its powerful northern neighbor Goguryeo. His three brothers would fight for the throne ending in all of their deaths and the crowning of Asin&#x27;s son.

<doc id="1165029" wikidata="Q1164658" url="?curid=1165029" title="Collimator">
<text>A collimator is a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves. To narrow can mean either to cause the directions of motion to become more aligned in a specific direction (i.e., make collimated light or parallel rays), or to cause the spatial cross section of the beam to become smaller (beam limiting device).

==History==
The English physicist Henry Kater was the inventor of the floating collimator, which rendered a great service to practical astronomy. He reported about his invention in January 1825. In his report, Kater mentioned previous work in this area by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Friedrich Bessel.

==Optical collimators==
In optics, a collimator may consist of a curved mirror or lens with some type of light source and/or an image at its focus. This can be used to replicate a target focused at infinity with little or no parallax.

In lighting, collimators are typically designed using the principles of nonimaging optics.

Optical collimators can be used to calibrate other optical devices, to check if all elements are aligned on the optical axis, to set elements at proper focus, or to align two or more devices such as binoculars or gun barrels and gunsights. A surveying camera may be collimated by setting its fiduciary markers so that they define the principal point, as in photogrammetry.

Optical collimators are also used as gun sights in the collimator sight, which is a simple optical collimator with a cross hair or some other reticle at its focus. The viewer only sees an image of the reticle. They have to use it either with both eyes open and one eye looking into the collimator sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and the target, or with one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time. Adding a beam splitter allows the viewer to see the reticle and the field of view, making a reflector sight.

Collimators may be used with laser diodes and CO2 cutting lasers. Proper collimation of a laser source with long enough coherence length can be verified with a shearing interferometer.

==X-ray, gamma ray, and neutron collimators==

In X-ray optics, gamma ray optics, and neutron optics, a collimator is a device that filters a stream of rays so that only those traveling parallel to a specified direction are allowed through. Collimators are used for X-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron imaging because it is difficult to focus these types of radiation into an image using lenses, as is routine with electromagnetic radiation at optical or near-optical wavelengths. Collimators are also used in radiation detectors in nuclear power stations to make them directionally sensitive.

===Applications===

The figure to the right illustrates how a Söller collimator is used in neutron and X-ray machines. The upper panel shows a situation where a collimator is not used, while the lower panel introduces a collimator. In both panels the source of radiation is to the right, and the image is recorded on the gray plate at the left of the panels.

Without a collimator, rays from all directions will be recorded; for example, a ray that has passed through the top of the specimen (to the right of the diagram) but happens to be travelling in a downwards direction may be recorded at the bottom of the plate. The resultant image will be so blurred and indistinct as to be useless.

In the lower panel of the figure, a collimator has been added (blue bars). This may be a sheet of lead or other material opaque to the incoming radiation with many tiny holes bored through it or in the case of neutrons it can be a sandwich arrangement (which can be up to several feet long; see ENGIN-X) with many layers alternating between neutron absorbing material (e.g., gadolinium) with neutron transmitting material. This can be something simple, such as air; alternatively, if mechanical strength is needed, a material such as aluminium may be used. If this forms part of a rotating assembly, the sandwich may be curved. This allows energy selection in addition to collimation; the curvature of the collimator and its rotation will present a straight path only to one energy of neutrons. Only rays that are travelling nearly parallel to the holes will pass through them—any others will be absorbed by hitting the plate surface or the side of a hole. This ensures that rays are recorded in their proper place on the plate, producing a clear image.

For industrial radiography using gamma radiation sources such as iridium-192 or cobalt-60, a collimator (beam limiting device) allows the radiographer to control the exposure of radiation to expose a film and create a radiograph, to inspect materials for defects. A collimator in this instance is most commonly made of tungsten, and is rated according to how many half value layers it contains, i.e., how many times it reduces undesirable radiation by half. For instance, the thinnest walls on the sides of a 4 HVL tungsten collimator thick will reduce the intensity of radiation passing through them by 88.5%. The shape of these collimators allows emitted radiation to travel freely toward the specimen and the x-ray film, while blocking most of the radiation that is emitted in undesirable directions such as toward workers.

===Limitations===

Although collimators improve resolution, they also reduce intensity by blocking incoming radiation, which is undesirable for remote sensing instruments that require high sensitivity. For this reason, the gamma ray spectrometer on the Mars Odyssey is a non-collimated instrument. Most lead collimators let less than 1% of incident photons through. Attempts have been made to replace collimators with electronic analysis. 

===In radiation therapy===
Collimators (beam limiting devices) are used in linear accelerators used for radiotherapy treatments. They help to shape the beam of radiation emerging from the machine and can limit the maximum field size of a beam.

The treatment head of a linear accelerator consists of both a primary and secondary collimator. The primary collimator is positioned after the electron beam has reached a vertical orientation. When using photons, it is placed after the beam has passed through the X-ray target. The secondary collimator is positioned after either a flattening filter (for photon therapy) or a scattering foil (for electron therapy). The secondary collimator consists of two jaws which can be moved to either enlarge or minimize the size of the treatment field.

New systems involving multileaf collimators (MLCs) are used to further shape a beam to localise treatment fields in radiotherapy. MLCs consist of approximately 50–120 leaves of heavy, metal collimator plates which slide into place to form the desired field shape.

===Computing the spatial resolution===

To find the spatial resolution of a parallel hole collimator with a hole length, formula_1, a hole diameter formula_2 and a distance to the imaged object formula_3, the following formula can be used
formula_4
where the effective length is defined as
formula_5
Where formula_6 is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material from which the collimator is made.

<doc id="1165031" wikidata="Q1757594" url="?curid=1165031" title="The Whole Story">
<text>The Whole Story is the second compilation album by English singer-songwriter Kate Bush and her first greatest hits album worldwide. Released on 10 November 1986, it earned Bush her third UK number-one album and went on to become her best-selling release to date, being certified four-times platinum in the United Kingdom.

The album includes eleven of Bush&#x27;s singles. It also includes &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, which had been released as a single three weeks earlier; it also reached the UK top 30. A remix of Bush&#x27;s debut single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1978) with newly re-recorded vocals opens the album. The album mix of &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; features on this release rather than the single version.

A home video compilation of the same name was released simultaneously, which includes the promotional videos for each song on the album. 
It was nominated for the Best Concept Music Video at the 1988 Grammy Awards.

In 2014, during Bush&#x27;s Before the Dawn residency at the Hammersmith Apollo, &quot;The Whole Story&quot; charted at number 8 in the UK. Following a resurgence of popularity for &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; in 2022, &quot;The Whole Story&quot; peaked at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart.

<doc id="1165033" wikidata="Q7631308" url="?curid=1165033" title="Subiaco Football Club">
<text>The Subiaco Football Club, nicknamed the Lions and known before 1973 as the Maroons, is an Australian rules football club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). It was founded in 1896, and admitted to the WAFL in 1901, along with North Fremantle. The club is currently based at Leederville Oval, having previously played at Subiaco Oval.

==History==
Subiaco was incorporated in 1896, establishing its base at a small playing arena within the environs of the Shenton Park Lake. During the club&#x27;s embryonic period it played in the &quot;First Rate Juniors&quot; competition from 1896 to 1900 and enjoyed premiership success. As a result, along with fellow First Rate Junior powerhouse North Fremantle the Subiaco Football Club joined the then &quot;West Australian Football Association&quot; competition (known today as the West Australian Football League – WAFL) in 1901. However, it struggled so much that there were long debates as to whether it should continue after it won only eleven games in its first seven seasons but with the construction of Subiaco Oval on what was formerly called the &quot;sand patch&quot;, the club&#x27;s performances improved: very slowly at first, but very rapidly after the acquisition of two key forwards in Phil Matson and Herbert Limb for the 1912 season. That year Subiaco rose from second last to their first ever premiership despite a thrashing from East Fremantle in the final, and they again won premierships against Perth in 1913 and 1915 before loss of players to World War I gave them the rare ignominy of plummeting from premiers to the wooden spoon in 1916.

During the inter-war period Subiaco were mainly a middle-of-the-road outfit, though they did win a premiership from third in 1924 and played in three grand finals for the rest of that decade, only to lose each time to East Fremantle or East Perth. They were noted for a large number of outstanding players during this period, including ruckman Tom Outridge and rover Johnny Leonard, but as these players declined Subiaco began a period of struggle that would rival their experiences in the 1900s (and from 1975 to 1983).

They plummeted to their first wooden spoon since 1916 in 1937 and made an extremely ambitious recruiting coup by providing local employment for three Victorian champions in Haydn Bunton, Keith Shea and Les Hardiman. Although Bunton lived up to his Fitzroy reputation and at times did work far beyond that expected of a rover, Shea and Hardiman did not, and Subiaco in the four seasons from 1938 to 1941 won only 23 and drew one of eighty games, finishing seventh twice and sixth twice in an eight-team competition.

After the WANFL operated on an under-age format for three seasons from 1942 to 1944, Subiaco rose to fifth in 1945 and third in 1946, but this proved a false honeymoon. Sorely lacking in high quality players, Subiaco between 1947 and 1956 won only thirty-eight of 198 games, and simply failed to recruit players of the quality that the two Fremantle sides, Perth and West Perth did. It was engaged in a consistent battle with Swan Districts for the wooden spoon, and never finished higher than seventh in an eight-team competition.

Late in the 1950s, Subiaco emerged from the doldrums in spectacular fashion when in its first final for thirteen years it kicked a remarkable 16.8 (104) in the third quarter against Perth - easily a record quarter score for a senior Australian rules final. They then beat East Fremantle to reach their first grand final since 1935, but were beaten by East Perth and in the following years Subiaco again struggled, winning only 69 and drawing three of 168 home-and-away games between 1960 and 1967 and never seeming to have good direction in their management. 1968, however, saw the club achieve stability through the recruitment of Haydn Bunton junior as coach and a record season from Austin Robertson at full forward, who kicked 157 goals and in one match against East Fremantle fifteen of nineteen (along with eleven behinds!). The club finished fourth every year from 1968 to 1970, but declined somewhat in 1971 and 1972. However, under new captain-coach Ross Smith and with the emergence of star players like Mike Fitzpatrick, Subiaco emerged for the first time since the Matson era as firm favourites for the flag during 1973 and duly beat West Perth.

However, with the departure of Fitzpatrick and Peter Featherby to the VFL, Subiaco returned to the dark days of the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1974 they reached the First Semi-Final only to lose to Swan Districts, but would not participate in the finals for a decade afterwards and finished absolutely last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982. In the process they won just 44 of 189 games, and in 1982 looked like a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. However, during this period every one of the other seven WAFL clubs won &quot;at least one premiership&quot;. Their only genuinely class player of this era, Gary Buckenara, defected to Hawthorn after three years with the Lions. Worse still, unlike that earlier bleak era, Subiaco were hit by severe financial problems and only community involvement during the early 1980s managed to save the club from extinction.

The return of Haydn Bunton junior as coach after a long stint with South Adelaide was viewed by most Subiaco fans as the return of a master, and it is remarkable how he rose a nearly defunct club to a major force in the WAFL. Subiaco moved from four wins to nine in 1984 (along with a reserves premiership) and rose to second behind East Fremantle in 1985. Although it was their first finals appearance since 1974, Subiaco did not disappoint but ultimately failed by five points. However, 1986 saw them even better, beating VFL club St Kilda in the Foster&#x27;s Cup and losing only four games all year - their second-best home-and-away return behind 1912 - before recovering from a thrashing from East Fremantle to demolish that team in the Grand Final by sixty-nine points.

Bunton junior&#x27;s aim of a Subiaco dynasty was ended by the formation of the West Coast Eagles that summer, which quickly drained the WAFL of all its best talent. Nonetheless, he coached the Lions to another premiership in 1988, and although they did decline to only six wins in 1989 and 1990, Subiaco maintained a respectable position in the weakened WAFL over the next decade, before becoming the richest and most powerful club therein during the 2000s under the coaching of Peter German and Scott Watters with premierships in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 - in the last of which they were amazingly unlucky not to be only the second undefeated team in open-age WAFL history suffering only a one-point loss to Swan Districts.

Subiaco would endure a lull after their historic three-peat between 2006 and 2008 before returning to the WAFL Grand Final against Claremont in 2011 under the guidance of ex-West Coast Eagle Chris Waterman. The Lions would be humbled by the Tigers on the day with a 56-point defeat solemnly ending Subiaco&#x27;s season. The Lions suffered a Grand Final hangover in 2012 free-falling down the table to finish seventh with only seven wins. This resulted in head coach Chris Waterman being replaced by club great Jarrad Schofield who played in two premierships for the Lions on either side of a 206-game AFL career. Schofield worked hard to instil a new system at Subiaco resulting in a low key eighth finish again in 2013 with only six wins; but it would set the building blocks for a miraculous face lift in 2014.

After recruiting heavily over the off-season and relying on a strong base of home-grown talent the Lions turned their fortunes around to finish second in 2014 and contend for their seventh grand final in eleven seasons. Subiaco lost their first semi-final to the heavily favoured Royals before pulling off a nail-biting five-point win over the East Fremantle Sharks in an elimination final to secure the club&#x27;s 24th Grand Final appearance. On a wet and blustery day the Lions proved too determined for the West Coast Eagles affiliated Royals to record a famous 16-point Grand Final victory and the club&#x27;s twelfth historically. Jason Bristow was awarded best on ground with 23 disposals and a goal whilst Kyal Horsley captained Subiaco to his second Grand Final. Subiaco veteran Darren Rumble became the club&#x27;s most successful player historically with his fifth premiership for the club.

Less than 24 hours after Subiaco secured their club&#x27;s twelfth premiership they also had the club&#x27;s second Brownlow Medallist with Matthew Priddis winning the AFL&#x27;s best and fairest after an outstanding season with the West Coast Eagles. Priddis played 63 games for the Lions including two WAFL premierships and a Sandover medal before being drafted to the Eagles in 2006.

Subiaco entered the 2015 season in their third season under Jarrad Schofield and had to replace a host of retiring premiership stars. Jason Bristow, Shaun Hildebrandt, Daniel Leishman, Andrew Mcdougall and Robert Forrest all retired after the 2014 premiership. Subiaco used the open market to bring in a host of talent with Victorians Leigh Kitchin and Brett Robinson joining the club as well as Scott Hancock (East Fremantle), Sam Menegola (Ex-Fremantle) and Jordan Lockyer (Ex-Sydney). Talented youngster Michael Wood also re-joined the Lions after a year on Fremantle&#x27;s list.

The influx of players had a big impact on the 2015 season with the six recruits combining for 117 games and big contributions in the club&#x27;s 13th flag. The Lions were the most dominant season over the 2015 WAFL season finishing four games on top with a record of 17–3. Subiaco crushed rivals West Perth by 55 points in the second semi at Medibank Stadium to book their place in the Grand Final.

Heading into their seventh Grand Final in ten years the Lions stood as comprehensive favourites. West Perth made it through after beating Fremantle aligned Peel Thunder and West Coast aligned East Perth but were a class below in WAFL Grand Final 131. The Lions outplayed the Falcons in every term to run out 66-point winners at Domain Stadium to secure the club&#x27;s 13th premiership. Matt Boland claimed the Simpson Medal for best player on ground with seven goals in a dazzling display.

Shane Yarran became the first player of indigenous heritage to win the leading goal-kicker award for Subi in 2015 with 46 on the season. The mercurial forward also claimed the REIWA Goal of the Year.

In 2016 the Lions looked to achieve the second three-peat in the club&#x27;s long history. Key premiership players Shane Yarran &amp; Sam Menegola departed to the AFL and 2016 proved to be the biggest challenge for Jarrad Schofield and his men. Despite finishing first over the home and away season and convincingly winning their semi-final, the Lions fell agonisingly short of the Peel Thunder squad. The Fremantle Football Club aligned club fielded 17 Dockers including past hero Shane Yarran. Subiaco lost by 23 points but earned the admiration of the WAFL community against an incredibly talented Peel side.

In 2019, Beau Wardman replaced Jarrad Schofield as senior coach and Leigh Kitchin took over the reins from Kyal Horsley as club captain. Adam Cockie and Brad Stevenson retired before the start of 2018. Zac Clarke was recruited by Essendon as part of the new AFL pre-season draft. Harry Marsh joined the Lions after being delisted by Sydney Swans. The club recorded an 17–1 season before winning the Grand Final by 96 points over South Fremantle, the biggest Grand Final win in club history. Ben Sokol was named Simpson Medalist. Lachlan Delahunty won the Sandover Medal by one vote from Kyal Horsley.

Subiaco were a foundation member of the WAFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2019.

==Club song==
The club song of the Subiaco Football Club is sung to the tune of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; written by John Irvin, a supporter of Subiaco, and adopted by the club.

<text>Antoine Bernard-Jean Marfan (; June 23, 1858 – February 11, 1942) was a French paediatrician.

He was born in Castelnaudary (département Aude, Languedoc-Roussillon) to Antoine Prosper Marfan and Adélaïde Thuries. He began his medical studies in Toulouse, where he stayed for two years before moving to Paris. He graduated in 1886, his education having been interrupted by a period of military service. In 1903 he became a professor of infantile hygiene in the paediatric clinic of the University of Paris. During the same year, he became a member of the Académie de Médecine.

In 1896, Marfan described a hereditary disorder of connective tissue that was to become known as Marfan syndrome, the term first being used by Henricus Jacobus Marie Weve (1888–1962) of Utrecht in 1931. Today, it is thought that Marfan&#x27;s patient (a five-year-old girl named Gabrielle) was affected by a condition known as congenital contractural arachnodactyly, and not Marfan&#x27;s syndrome.

Further eponymous medical conditions named after Antoine Marfan include:
* Dennie–Marfan syndrome
* Marfan&#x27;s hypermobility syndrome
* Marfan&#x27;s law
* Marfan&#x27;s sign
* Marfan&#x27;s symptom
* Marfan–Madelung syndrome

Marfan also had interests in the paediatric aspects of tuberculosis, nutrition and diphtheria. With Jacques-Joseph Grancher (1843–1907) and Jules Comby (1853–1947), he was co-author of &quot;Traité des maladies de l’enfance&quot;. From 1913 to 1922, he was publisher of the journal &quot;Le Nourrisson&quot;.

<doc id="1165039" wikidata="Q7567317" url="?curid=1165039" title="South Fremantle Football Club">
<text>South Fremantle Football Club is an Australian rules football club based in Fremantle, Western Australia. The club plays in the Western Australian Football League (WAFL) and the WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW), commonly going by the nickname the &quot;Bulldogs&quot;. Since its founding, the club has won 14 WAFL premierships, the most recent of them in 2020.

Founded in 1900 after disbanding the successful but debt-burdened Fremantle Football Club (not related to the AFL Dockers entity), the club enjoyed its most successful era in the immediate decade following the end of the Second World War, winning six premierships, including a hat-trick from 1952 to 1954.

South Fremantle has a long-standing rivalry with cross-town WAFL club , a fixture commonly referred to as the Fremantle Derby. The club has played at its home ground, Fremantle Oval, from inception and were co-tenants with East Fremantle until 1952, when the Sharks moved to East Fremantle Oval. From the beginning, Souths adopted the club colours red and white, first adding the iconic front vee to its playing jumper in 1928.

For a club with a history of over 120 years, South Fremantle does not yet boast a footballer who has played 300 or more senior League games in the red and white guernsey. The club is also recognised for its significant contribution of players who hail from Indigenous Australian, Italian and Croatian heritage.

==History==
The Fremantle Football Club (originally known as Unions and unrelated to either an earlier club and the current AFL club of the same name) had won ten premierships in the fourteen years that they were in the WA Football Association (now known as the West Australian Football League). By 1899, however, the club suffered from financial problems that caused the club to disband. The South Fremantle Football Club was formed to take their place following an application to the league by Griff John, who would be appointed secretary of the new club, with Tom O&#x27;Beirne the inaugural president. Most players, however, were from the defunct Fremantle club.

The new club did well in its first year, finishing runners-up. However, over the next three seasons the performance fell away badly and, in April 1904 a Fremantle newspaper confidently reported that South Fremantle would not appear again. However, the club decided to carry on and centreman Harry Hodge took over as skipper, but the season was a disaster. The club won only one game.

They won their first premiership in 1916 and went back-to-back in 1917, both times defeating their local rivals, East Fremantle in the final and challenge final. The 1930s were not as successful, marred by the death of the 23-year-old captain-coach Ron Doig as a result of injuries sustained in a match. After World War II, South experienced their greatest era, with the arrival of future Hall of Fame members Steve Marsh, Bernie Naylor, John Todd and Clive Lewington. Between 1945 and 1956 they would win six premierships, be runners-up three times and make the finals in every season. Since then, however, they have won six more premierships, in 1970, 1980, 1997, 2005, 2009 and 2020.

South Fremantle was the first WAFL club to have won 10 grand finals since World War II. Four of their 14 premierships were won against the club&#x27;s traditional rivals, East Fremantle. The club completed a rare double in 2009, claiming both the league and reserves premierships. 
This was the first time the club had taken the Premiership double since 1954.

In 2020 the club received a license to field a team in the WAFL Women&#x27;s league.

On the 14th of March 2023, the club was fined $25,000, deducted 8 premiership points for season 2023, received a deduction amount to their TPP of $10,525 for 2023 as well as a reduction of 10 player points for 2023.
===Fremantle Derby===

The Fremantle Derby, is traditionally one of the biggest game of the year on the WAFL calendar. The derbies still have a great following but have decreased in importance compared to the Western Derby, the match between WA&#x27;s two AFL teams.

The Foundation Day derby on the first Monday in June (a public holiday to mark the Foundation of Western Australia in 1829) is commonly the highest attended game of the home and away season. To the end of the 2023 season the two clubs had met 389 times with South Fremantle winning 186 to East Fremantle&#x27;s 199 wins, 4 Draws have occurred between the two sides.

==The club==

===Club guernsey &amp; colours===
South Fremantle&#x27;s Guernsey (shown right) used for all WAFL matches is all white with a red V in the centre of the guernsey. During the 1990s they also introduced the reverse of the traditional guernsey with a white V on a red jumper. The South Fremantle colours of red &amp; white stem from the first Fremantle based team who wore red and white in the mid-1880s.

===Supporters===

South hold three notable WAFL Grand Final attendance records, 1979 v East Fremantle, 52,781, the highest ever attendance at a WAFL Grand Final, 1975 v West Perth, 52,322, the second highest ever Grand Final attendance and 1989 v Claremont, 38,198, the highest ever Grand Final attendance in the post AFL period.

===Club song===
&quot;We&#x27;re the Bulldogs&quot; is the theme song of the South Fremantle Football Club which is sung to the tune of &quot;With a Little Bit of Luck&quot;, played as the league team comes to the field at home and away games, and after a victory.
:We are the mighty Bulldogs
:Always fighting on
:With victory and flag our goal
:With guts and determination
:We put the rest to shame
:Because our fighting spirit wins the game.

:We&#x27;re the Bulldogs (yes we are)
:And we&#x27;re the greatest (yes we are)
:The mighty red &#x27;V&#x27; which stands for victory
:The rough tough Bulldogs (yes we are)
:South Fremantle (yes we are)
:The Southerners for ever more
:Down by the Port of Fremantle
:We hit them really hard
:With true grit and courage we win
:So come on Souths let&#x27;s show them
:How to play the game to win
:South Fremantle for ever more

:We&#x27;re the Bulldogs (yes we are)
:And we&#x27;re the greatest (yes we are)
:The mighty red &#x27;V&#x27; which stands for victory
:The rough tough Bulldogs (yes we are)
:South Fremantle (yes we are)
:The Southerners for ever more.

<text>The West Perth Football Club, nicknamed the Falcons, is an Australian rules football club located in Joondalup, Western Australia. West Perth competes in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW) and is the oldest existing Australian rules football club in Western Australia. Originally located at Leederville Oval, the team was relocated in 1994 to Arena Joondalup, a sports complex in the northern suburbs of Perth. The team&#x27;s club song is &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Flag&quot; and its traditional rivals are East Perth.

==History==
The Victorian Football Club was established at a meeting on 2 May 1885. The new team was to play its games at the Recreation Ground (now Esplanade Reserve) and wear the colours cardinal and navy. Two weeks after the establishment of the new club it formed the WAFA together with Rovers and Fremantle. The three clubs, along with High School (now Hale School) were to play out the 1885 season, however High School dropped out after just two rounds.

The West Australian Football Club was established in 1886 and were admitted to the competition for the 1887 season. At a meeting of the two clubs on 16 April 1889, it was unanimously decided to amalgamate the two clubs – West Australian and Victorians – into a single club known as the Metropolitan Football Club for the 1889 season. The West Australian colours of black and red were to be maintained for the new club. In 1891, a meeting of footballers was held to form a new team, to be called West Perth, which embraced the members of the then-defunct Metropolitan Football Club. The new club was immediately granted entry into the WA Football Association (later called the WA Football League) and won its first premiership in 1897.

In 1915 the team became the original tenant of the newly built Leederville Oval where it would remain based until 1993, at which time the team moved to Joondalup to play games at Arena Joondalup from the 1994 season onwards. Since relocating, the Falcons have enjoyed relative success with five premierships from nine grand finals, the most recent flag coming in 2022.

In 2022 the club became the seventh active club to participate in the WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW), the premier state-based competition for female footballers.

Since joining the WAFLW competition, the club celebrated real success with a Preliminary Final appearance in just their third season in the competition. Marking West Perth Football Clubs&#x27; Women&#x27;s WAFLW side as the most successful expansion side since the WAFLW began. 

West Perth Football Clubs&#x27; Rogers Cup side (U19s competition) is amongst some of the most successful teams in Australian sporting history. Winning the flag in an undefeated season in 2021, this was backed up by 2-undefeated seasons in 2023 and 2024, culminating in a further 2 premierships for the club. As at August 2024, the Rogers Cup team sit at 34 wins in a row - An impressive undefeated streak. 

==Club song==

:&quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Flag&quot;
:&quot;(Sung to the tune of &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot;)&quot;

: It&#x27;s a grand old flag it&#x27;s a high flying flag, 
: It&#x27;s the emblem for me and for you, 
: It&#x27;s the emblem of the team we love, 
: The team of the red and the blue,
: Every heart beats true for the red and the blue, 
: And we sing this song to you, 
: Should old acquaintance be forgot, 
: Keep your eye on the red and the blue!

<text>The Peel Thunder Football Club is an Australian rules football club playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). The team is based in Mandurah, Western Australia, with their home ground being Rushton Park. The club joined the WAFL as an expansion team in 1997.

Since 2014 Peel have been in a formal alignment with the Fremantle Dockers of the Australian Football League, an arrangement which sees Fremantle&#x27;s reserve players play for Peel.

==History==
Peel Thunder Football Club was formed in 1996 after the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC) granted a ninth licence in the WAFL to the Mandurah-Peel region. The licence was issued on the condition that the club be ready to compete in the 1997 Westar Rules season. Geoff Miles was appointed as the club&#x27;s inaugural coach and Phil Gilbert appointed captain. The Thunder managed just one win in 1997 and finished last on the ladder, with Scott Simister winning the inaugural best and fairest. They managed another one-win season in 1998, before going winless in 1999.

In March 2011, the club was fined $10,000 for breaching salary cap rules involving player payments to midfielder Rory O&#x27;Brien during the 2009 season.

Between 1997 and 2014, the Thunder failed to qualify for the finals, with their best season coming in 2008 when they recorded an 8–12 win–loss record and a sixth-place finish. During that time, they collected nine wooden spoons, including three in a row twice (1997–99 &amp; 2011–13), and finished second last seven times.

In 2014, Peel became directly aligned with the Fremantle Dockers of the Australian Football League, an arrangement which saw Fremantle&#x27;s reserve players playing exclusively for Peel in the WAFL for the first time. In 2015, the second season of this arrangement, Peel qualified for the finals for the first time in its history, finishing third on the ladder with a club-best record of 13–7. Due to Fremantle&#x27;s decision to rest a host of its key AFL players ahead of their finals campaign, the majority of Peel&#x27;s usual Fremantle contingent was called up for AFL duties, which impacted Peel&#x27;s ability to field a competitive team against West Perth in the qualifying final. As a result, Peel was blown out of the water by West Perth, losing their first finals game 145–36. Despite regaining many of their Fremantle players for their semi-final clash against East Perth the following week, they were knocked out of the finals with an 84–62 defeat at the hands of the Royals.

In 2016, the Thunder finished the home and away season in fourth place on the ladder with an 11–9 record. Despite a drop off from 2015, Peel headed into the WAFL finals with a huge boost thanks to Fremantle&#x27;s poor season in 2016. With Fremantle missing the finals in 2016, it provided Peel with a huge contingent of players for their finals campaign. Behind 17 Docker-listed players, the Thunder won three do-or-die finals in a row against East Perth, West Perth and South Fremantle respectively to reach their first ever WAFL grand final. In the grand final, Peel defeated Subiaco by 23 points to win their first WAFL premiership. Peel&#x27;s midfield had too much running power and grunt inside for Subiaco, with Docker Connor Blakely winning the Simpson Medal on the back of 38 possessions. Fellow Docker Ed Langdon was also an important contributor with 39 disposals, eight marks and a goal.

Peel were a foundation member of the WAFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2019. The club recorded their first senior women&#x27;s premiership in the competition in the 2020 season.

<text>Tengen Inc. was an American video game publisher and developer that was created by the arcade game manufacturer Atari Games for publishing computer and console games. It had a Japanese subsidiary named .

==History==
By 1984, Atari, Inc. had been split into two distinct companies. Atari Corporation was responsible for computer and console games and hardware and owned the rights to the Atari brand for these domains. Atari Games was formed from Atari, Inc.&#x27;s arcade division, and were able to use the Atari name on arcade releases but not on console or computer games. When Atari Games wanted to enter the console game market, it needed to create a new label that did not use the Atari name. The new subsidiary was dubbed Tengen, which in the Japanese nomenclature of the board game Go refers to the central point of the board (the word &quot;Atari&quot; comes from the same game).

At the time, Nintendo restricted their licensees to releasing only five games per year, mandated that Nintendo handle cartridge manufacturing, and required their games to be NES-exclusive for two years. Atari Games tried to negotiate for a less restrictive license to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment System; Nintendo refused, so in December 1987, Atari Games agreed to Nintendo&#x27;s standard licensing terms. Tengen was incorporated on December 21 of that year. In 1988, Tengen released its first and only three games licensed by Nintendo: &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and &quot;Gauntlet&quot;.

Meanwhile, Tengen secretly worked to bypass Nintendo&#x27;s lock-out chip called 10NES that prevented unlicensed NES games from running. While numerous manufacturers managed to override this chip by zapping it with a voltage spike, Tengen engineers feared this could potentially damage NES consoles and expose them to unnecessary liability, and so they started development on a chip they called Rabbit. The other problem was that Nintendo made frequent modifications to the NES to prevent this technique from working. Instead, Tengen chose to reverse engineer the chip and decipher the code required to unlock it. However, the engineers were unable to do so, and the launch date for its first batch of games was rapidly approaching.

With time running short, Tengen turned to the United States Copyright Office. Its lawyers contacted the government office to request a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, claiming that the company needed it for potential litigation against Nintendo. Once obtained, it used the program to create its own chip that would unlock the NES. Tengen announced that they were going to release their own cartridges in December 1988. When Tengen launched the unlicensed versions of its games, Nintendo immediately sued Tengen for copyright and patent infringement. This began a series of lawsuits between the companies which would not be settled until 1994.

Tengen faced another court challenge with Nintendo in 1989 in copyright controversy over the two companies&#x27; NES versions of &quot;Tetris&quot;. Tengen lost this suit as well, and was forced to recall what was estimated to be hundreds and thousands of unsold cartridges of its version of &quot;Tetris&quot; (having sold only about 50,000 copies).

Tengen went on to produce games for other systems, including the Sega Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, and TurboGrafx-16, and a few more, as well as publish a localized Sega CD title. The company also licensed games for home computers such as the Amiga and the Atari ST, most of which were published by British company Domark. It was best known for its ports of popular Atari arcade games, including &quot;Klax&quot;, &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;STUN Runner&quot;, and &quot;Paperboy&quot;, although they published many other titles as well. In 1994, with the lawsuit against Nintendo settled, and after Time Warner re-acquired a controlling stake in Atari Games, Tengen was consolidated into Time Warner Interactive.

===Revival===
In 2024, homebrew developer Jeff Silvers acquired the &quot;Tengen&quot; trademark to launch a new company called Tengen Games. The company&#x27;s first game was &quot;Zed and Zee&quot;, an 8-bit arcade-style action platformer for NES, Famicom, and Windows.

==NES games==
Tengen manufactured both licensed and unlicensed versions of three of their NES games (&quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). The cartridges for their unlicensed games did not come in the gray, semi-square shape that licensed NES games came in; instead, they are rounded and matte-black, and resemble the original Atari cartridges.

<text>Melissa Fumero ( Gallo; born August 19, 1982) is an American actress and television director. She made her professional debut in 2004 in the recurring role of Adriana Cramer in the television soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Following several minor roles, she had her first main role as Amy Santiago in the comedy series &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, which she played from 2013 to 2021. Since then, she has starred as Melissa Tarleton in the animated series &quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot; (2021), Eliza Walker in the Netflix comedy &quot;Blockbuster&quot; (2022), and Bella Digman in the animated series &quot;Digman!&quot; (2023–present). She is married to actor and former model David Fumero, with whom she has two sons.

==Early life==
Melissa Gallo was born in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, on August 19, 1982. Her Cuban parents moved to the U.S. as teenagers. Her mother was a homemaker and hairdresser, and her father taught mathematics and worked at a jewelry store. She grew up in Guttenberg and moved back to Lyndhurst at age six. She and her family spoke Spanish at home, but her parents stopped requiring her and her brother to do so when he encountered issues at school. She attended Lyndhurst High School.

As a child, Fumero enjoyed creating and performing plays, and began taking dance lessons. She expressed interest in acting after seeing Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; at age ten. Her parents subsequently sent her to acting classes. She has said she enjoyed theater lessons because she and her classmates focused on performing rather than their physical appearances. She remained enrolled in dance and acting classes until her graduation. When she was accepted to New York University (NYU), which she called her &quot;dream school&quot;, she thought she would be unable to attend due to the cost. To ensure she could attend, her parents spent much of their savings and took out many loans, and she moved back in with them until she moved to New York City at age 19. In 2003, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama.

==Career==
===2004–2012: &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and other roles===
Fumero felt ostracized when she began working in the entertainment business. She was only able to audition for certain roles. Hours after her final exam at NYU, she was offered the role of Adriana Cramer on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (&quot;OLTL&quot;), which she described as &quot;the biggest redeeming moment&quot;. She joined the series on January 20, 2004, and reprised the role in two 2005 episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;. She was set to leave the show shortly after her contract with &quot;OLTL&quot; expired in January 2008, but stayed until June 11; her final scenes were filmed in May. She returned to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; on several occasions between September 2008 and January 2011.

In 2008, she starred in &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; as Ati, a 17-year-old who is persuaded to dance. For the role, she learned the character&#x27;s Spanish Harlem accent—a task she found difficult—and extensively trained in stretching and yoga to perform the modern and contemporary dance. After &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, she expressed interest in performing comedy, and booked a role in &quot;Important Things with Demetri Martin&quot; for Comedy Central in 2009. The following years, she appeared in &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;Royal Pains&quot;, &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

===2013–2020: breakthrough with &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;===
Fumero&#x27;s first starring role and breakthrough came in 2013, when she was cast in Fox&#x27;s untitled comedy pilot as the female lead opposite Andy Samberg. The show&#x27;s title was announced in April 2013 as &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;. It follows a group of New York Police Department detectives in Brooklyn&#x27;s fictional 99th precinct. Fumero portrays the rule-following, competitive character Amy Santiago. To prepare, she and &quot;Brooklyn&quot; cast received police and firearm training. Fumero is one of the show&#x27;s two regular Latina cast members, the other being Stephanie Beatriz, who portrays Rosa Diaz. Fumero described this casting as groundbreaking, though the two feared one of them would be fired. As a result, they tried to make their appearances as distinct from one another as possible; for example, Fumero&#x27;s character has straight hair while Beatriz&#x27;s has wavy hair. Due to her lack of experience in comedy, Fumero was usually nervous, a trait the writers incorporated into Amy&#x27;s personality. On September 17, 2013, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; pilot aired, garnering over six million viewers and positive reviews. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the contrasts between Samberg&#x27;s and Fumero&#x27;s acting styles, calling her &quot;a real find&quot;. Reviews of the first season were also positive, and it received 5.2 million total viewers.

In May 2014, Fox renewed &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; for a second season that would air during the 2014–2015 television season. Its premiere, &quot;Undercover&quot;, was well received by critics. Reception of Fumero&#x27;s performance was positive; &quot;Collider&quot; lauded her comedic timing, drive, and vulnerability, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found her acting convincing in a scene in which Amy tells Jake (Samberg) &quot;[n]othing&#x27;s going to happen&quot; between them romantically. Journalists lauded the rest of the season and deemed the cast &quot;winning&quot;. In 2015, the show&#x27;s cast were nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Fumero&#x27;s performance garnered her an Imagen Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress; she later received three more nominations for her work on the same show, including a win in 2022.

&quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; third season premiered in September 2015. Fumero said she found comic acting much easier, having become more familiar with Amy&#x27;s character, and added she had &quot;fallen into a real groove and rhythm&quot; with her approach to scenes. Fumero was pregnant during the season&#x27;s production, which led to a storyline in which Amy goes undercover as a pregnant woman. The directors and camera operators used methods such as positioning her behind objects to hide her pregnancy. Of the experience, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t recommend it&quot;, citing difficulties memorizing her lines and focusing on scenes. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; fourth and fifth seasons aired from September 2016 to May 2018; both seasons were acclaimed by critics, who continued to praise the ensemble.

In May 2018, Fox cancelled &quot;Brooklyn&quot; after five seasons. The news quickly became the subject of social media campaigns for the show&#x27;s renewal. A day after the cancellation, NBC accepted an offer to air the show for a sixth season. Fumero described the experience as &quot;the most intense and emotional 36 hours of my life.&quot; On January 10, 2019, the season debuted to an audience of 3.6 million, the show&#x27;s highest ratings in two years. Over its eighteen-episode run, it received 3.1 million viewers. Critics unanimously praised the season. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented the season premiere was &quot;a quick and easy reminder of how good Fumero and Samberg are together;&quot; the magazine said Samberg&#x27;s smaller moments gave her the chance to be &quot;wonderfully broad&quot;. Fumero&#x27;s performance in the #MeToo-themed episode &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; garnered particular praise: &quot;Den of Geek&quot; found her phenomenal; &quot;TVLine&quot; named her their performer of the week, calling her performance &quot;understated yet effective&quot; and commending her &quot;soft-spoken tone [that] captured the broken spirit of a woman burdened by victimhood, whose self-worth was forever sullied by the actions of a man who had power over her and chose to abuse it.&quot;

After Fumero complained about a director, her manager asked whether she was considering directing. Fumero dismissed the possibility but her manager had her direct a webisode, which she &quot;ended up really loving&quot;. She was hesitant to ask NBC to let her direct an episode of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, although she felt more women of color should be directing: &quot;I didn&#x27;t ask this season, because it was NBC and ... we&#x27;re women, and like, I don&#x27;t wanna ruffle any feathers and it was like, I can&#x27;t ask a boy to dance, they have to ask me.&quot; After the network ordered five additional episodes, and Joe Lo Truglio and Beatriz told her they were applying, Fumero did so as well. She made her directorial debut with the episode &quot;Return of the King&quot; in 2019. It received mixed reviews; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated: &quot;It&#x27;s interesting to see Amy essentially direct Rosa to bizarre greatness as Melissa Fumero is actually directing this entire oddity of an episode.&quot; Fumero also appeared in &quot;Brooklyn&quot; seventh season.

In 2020, her vocal performance in Disney Junior&#x27;s &quot;Elena of Avalor&quot; as Antonia—the titular character&#x27;s seamster and later the first female member of the royal guard—Fumero earned her fourth Imagen Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The prior year, she appeared in the reboot of 1975 television series &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;. Fumero said the latter role was &quot;especially huge&quot; because she worked with Gloria Estefan, to whose songs she listened as a child.

===2021–present: &quot;M.O.D.O.K&quot; and &quot;Blockbuster&quot;===
In the animated series &quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot;, Fumero voiced Melissa Tarleton, the titular character&#x27;s 17-year-old daughter who wants to gain his approval as a supervillain. When she auditioned, Fumero was not given any information about the show; she accepted the role when she learned Patton Oswalt would help develop and write the show, knowing it was &quot;going to be hilarious&quot;. Of the show&#x27;s premise, Fumero said: &quot;I just thought that take was super fun and fresh to do a show from the point of view of a supervillain, to dive into what his family life could potentially be in this world of villains and supervillains.&quot; The show was released on May 21, 2021, to critical acclaim and particular praise for its cast. Commenting on Fumero&#x27;s voice acting, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; said she &quot;[brings Melissa] to life with just the right amount of teenaged moodiness&quot;.

&quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; eighth and final season began its broadcast on August 12, 2021, with the episodes &quot;The Good Ones&quot; and &quot;The Lake House&quot;. Both episodes garnered positive reviews, with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praising Fumero as one of the &quot;comedic centerpieces&quot; of the former. Reviews of the season were mostly positive. Fumero compared the experience of leaving &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to high-school graduation:

[Y]ou&#x27;re so proud that you did the thing and you reached this moment, but you&#x27;re also so sad because deep down, you know all your friends are going to different colleges and you&#x27;re never going to see them again. It&#x27;s that mix of really proud and grateful.

After finishing &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, Fumero was unsure whether she wanted to act in another workplace comedy. However, she was excited when she was given the script for Netflix&#x27;s comedy &quot;Blockbuster&quot;, whose writer, Vanessa Ramos, Fumero had met on &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; and described as &quot;one of the funniest people [she has] ever met&quot;. Fumero thought the script was &quot;amazing&quot; and accepted the role, partially because she wanted to work with Ramos and lead actor Randall Park. Fumero &quot;immediately connected&quot; to her character Eliza, a devoted mother who is experiencing difficulties with her marriage to her teenage boyfriend. Eliza, unlike Amy, felt lost. At first, Fumero felt nervous about portraying Eliza, who she wanted to ensure was a distinctive character. &quot;Blockbuster&quot; premiered on November 3, 2022. &quot;IGN&quot; described Fumero&#x27;s performance as &quot;engaging and sometimes passionate&quot;; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said the show&#x27;s characters caused the actors to perform at &quot;half speed&quot;.

In 2021, Fumero was cast in the comedy film &quot;Bar Fight!&quot;. It follows former couple Nina (Fumero) and Allen (Luka Jones), who to avoid drama after their breakup divided everything in their lives—except their favorite local bar, an omission that causes a battle between them. The film was released on November 11, 2022, to negative reviews. Elizabeth Weitzman of &quot;TheWrap&quot; said Fumero and co-star Rachel Bloom &quot;don&#x27;t have the BFF chemistry both actresses work hard to generate, but that&#x27;s because the characters are all sketched in two dimensions&quot;. That year, Fumero joined the cast of adult animated television series &quot;Digman!&quot; as Bella Digman, reuniting with Samberg, the voice of the titular character (once again her onscreen husband) and co-creator of the show. Fumero also directed two episodes of the 2023 sitcom &quot;Primo&quot;, which was created by Shea Serrano and co-executive produced by &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; co-creator Michael Schur. In 2024, Fumero began hosting the comedy podcast &quot;More Better with Stephanie and Melissa&quot; alongside Beatriz. 
==Public image==
Fumero appeared in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; &quot;Young Hispanic Hollywood Class of 2013&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; listed her as one of its &quot;10 Latinos to Watch&quot;. &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; included her in a list of &quot;50 Latina and Hispanic Actresses Who Are Changing Hollywood for the Better&quot; in 2021.

==Personal life==
Fumero met actor and former model David Fumero, a fellow Cuban-American, on the set of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. They became engaged in late 2006 and married in New Jersey on December 9, 2007. They have two sons, born March 24, 2016 and February 14, 2020.

<text>Hugh Boyd M‘Neile (18 July 1795 – 28 January 1879) was a well-connected and controversial Irish-born Calvinist Anglican of Scottish descent.

Fiercely anti-Tractarian and anti-Roman Catholic (and, even more so, anti-Anglo-Catholic) and an Evangelical and millenarian cleric, who was also a devoted advocate of the year-for-a-day principle, M‘Neile was the perpetual curate of St Jude&#x27;s Liverpool (1834–1848), the perpetual curate of St Paul&#x27;s Princes Park (1848–1867), an honorary canon of Chester Cathedral (1845–1868) and the Dean of Ripon (1868–1875).

He was a member of the Protestant Association (in its 19th-century incarnation), the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews, the Irish Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the Church Association.

M‘Neile was an influential, well-connected demagogue, a renowned public speaker, an evangelical cleric and a relentless opponent of &quot;Popery&quot;, who was permanently inflamed by the ever-increasing number of Irish Roman Catholics in Liverpool. He was infamous for his stirring oratory, his immoderate preaching, and his prolific publications. He was just as deeply loved, admired and respected by some, as he was an object of derision and scorn for others.
== Family ==
Hugh Boyd M‘Neile, the younger son of Alexander M&#x27;Neile (1762–1838) and Mary M&#x27;Neile, née McNeale (?-1852), was born at Ballycastle, County Antrim on 17 July 1795, just three years before the Irish Rebellion of 1798; and, in 1798, M‘Neile was taken by his mother from Ballycastle to relatives in Scotland, in an open boat, to escape the dangers and atrocities of &quot;the troubles&quot; associated with the Irish Rebellion (Boyd, 1968).

M‘Neile&#x27;s father owned considerable property (including the large farm at Collier&#x27;s Hall), was a Justice of the Peace and served as the High Sheriff of the County of Antrim. His brother, John M‘Neile (1788–1855), having made his fortune in South America, returned to Ireland and was one of the founding members of the Northern Bank, the first bank in Belfast. John M‘Neile married Charlotte Lavinia Dallas (1803–1859) on 11 June 1823 and had two sons, Henry Hugh (1829–?) and Alexander John (1842–?) and one daughter, Mary Harriet (1833–1919), who married Hugh McCalmont Cairns (1810–1885), the First Earl Cairns, who served as Attorney General in the third Derby–Disraeli ministry (10 July 1866 – 29 October 1866), as Lord Chancellor in the first and second Disraeli ministries, and as (opposition) Conservative Leader in the House of Lords (1869–1870).

M‘Neile was tall, extremely strong, intelligent, a good horseman and considered by most to be extremely handsome.

In 1822 M‘Neile married Anne Magee (1803–1881), the fourth daughter of William Magee (1766–1831), the Archbishop of Dublin. They had sixteen children (four of whom died early in life): three daughters, two of whom remained unmarried, and thirteen sons. As a testament to his influence, a number of his children went on to have distinguished careers, including:
*Alexander M‘Neile (1823–1912)
*Colonel William M‘Neile (1824–1870), Commissioner of Punjab.
*Elizabeth M‘Neile (1827–1910)
*Hugh M‘Neile (1828–1842), who was killed, aged 14, in an accident with a loaded pistol.
*Mary M‘Neile (1831– ?)
*Daniel James M‘Neile (1835–1874), of the Bengal Civil Service.
*John Magee M‘Neile (1837–1898)
*Anne M‘Neile (1838–?) 
*The Revd Edmund Hugh M‘Neile (1840–1893), an honorary canon of Liverpool (1880–1893), also served at St Paul&#x27;s, Prince&#x27;s Park, Liverpool (1867–1893) and as chaplain to the Bishop of Chester (1877–1884). He married Cecilia Elizabeth (1841–1929), daughter of Sir Thomas Francis Fremantle, Lord Cottesloe (1798–1890).
*Charles M‘Neile (1841–1925) 
*The Revd Hector M‘Neile (1843–1922), a fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1865–1871), the vicar of Bredbury, Cheshire (1893–1900), a missionary of the Church Missionary Society in Bombay (1900–1907) and vicar of Bishop&#x27;s Sutton, Hampshire (1907–1922). He married Mary Rosa Lush. One of his three sons, the Revd Robert Fergus M‘Neile, and two of his daughters, Annie Hilda M‘Neile and Jessie Margaret M‘Neile, served as missionaries in Egypt and Palestine. His third daughter, Ethel Rhoda M‘Neile (1875–1922), served as a missionary in India.
*Captain Malcolm M‘Neile (1845–1923), R.N., Governor, Royal Naval Prison at Lewes.
*Norman Frederick M‘Neile (1846–1929), Known as &quot;the blind vicar&quot;, he was born on 14 August 1846 and served at St Peter&#x27;s Brafferton Parish Church in Helperby, Yorkshire for 50 years. Married to Clara Cecilia Willink (1852–1929) in July 1881. He was completely blind from the age of 12.

== Education ==

M‘Neile received a private education. He entered Trinity College Dublin in 1810, and graduated Artium Baccalaureus (AB), with a good degree in classics in 1815. He also began legal studies at The King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin and, having served all his terms there, transferred to London&#x27;s Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1814. He almost completed his terms there as well when, around 1819, he decided to abandon the law as well as the political career that his family had anticipated for him and return to his studies in order to qualify for ordination. He graduated &quot;Magister Artium&quot;, at Dublin University in 1822.

In 1847, M‘Neilee graduated Bachelor of Divinity (BD) and Doctor of Divinity (DD) from Dublin University. In essence, the BD degree was a coursework and postgraduate degree only available to those who had graduated MA at least 10 years earlier; the DD was conventionally awarded simultaneously on the basis of published work. In M‘Neile&#x27;s case the published work would have been &quot;The Church and the Churches&quot; (1846).

On 16 June 1860, an Incorporate DD – i.e., a doctorate (&quot;to the same degree&quot;), admitting M‘Neile as a member of Cambridge University by virtue of his possession of a DD from another university (Trinity College Dublin) – was conferred upon him at Cambridge University.

== Early adulthood ==
While a student, and preparing for a career in the law, M‘Neile loved the theatre even more than the fashionable society in which he moved. He attended the theatre in Dublin, London and Bath as often as he could. In those days, Sarah Siddons, her brother John, and Eliza O&#x27;Neill (later Lady Wrixon-Becher) – all favourites of M‘Neile – were at their peak; and his later platform and pulpit performances drew very heavily on their example.

When M‘Neile was 20, his father&#x27;s unmarried brother, Lieutenant-General Daniel M’Neile (1754–1826), returned to Ireland following distinguished service with the East India Company. His uncle, who settled in Bath, delighted in M’Neile&#x27;s company, and his uncle virtually adopted him; and, it seemed, he was the heir presumptive to his uncle&#x27;s considerable fortune. His uncle, whose wealth and influence would have easily have procured M‘Neile a seat in parliament, and who understood that success at the bar would be a stepping-stone for the talented lad into a productive political career, encouraged him to pursue a legal career. He took his A.B. in 1815, and continued his legal studies.

Most of his time between 1815 and 1819 was spent with his uncle in Bath. In 1816 he and his uncle travelled extensively on the continent, enjoying the social advantages of his uncle&#x27;s influence. In the process, M’Neile spent time with mixing with influential people, such as Madame de Staël (1766–1817) and Lord Byron (1788–1824).

In the middle of 1816, while staying with his uncle in a Swiss village inn, M’Neile fell very seriously ill. His life was saved by the medical intervention of Henry Brougham (1778–1868), a stranger to M’Neile at the time, who had called at the inn for refreshment (or a change of horses). Upon his return to England, a changed M’Neile began reading the Bible daily and, around 1819, he experienced a conversion to Christianity within the Evangelical Anglican tradition. To his uncle&#x27;s dismay, he hinted that he might give away law and politics and dedicate his life to the church. According to most accounts, when he finally announced that he was embracing church ministry as a profession, his greatly disappointed uncle &quot;disinherited&quot; him.

== Clerical career ==
Following his theological studies, M‘Neile was ordained in 1820 by his future father-in-law, William Magee (1766–1831) – who, at that time, was the Church of Ireland&#x27;s Bishop of Raphoe – and served as a curate in Stranorlar, County Donegal from 1820 to 1821. Early in 1822, his preaching in London so impressed the banker and parliamentarian Henry Drummond (1786–1860) that Drummond appointed M‘Neile to the living of the parish of Albury, Surrey, from where M‘Neile&#x27;s first collection of sermons, &quot;Seventeen Sermons, etc.&quot;, were published in 1825.

From 1826 to 1830, Drummond hosted the annual Albury Conferences, held in Albury for the Union of the Students of Prophecy moderated by M‘Neile. Each of the Albury Conferences involved days full of close and laborious study of the prophetical books of the Bible; attempting to seek out as-yet-unfulfilled prophecies within them. As they progressed, &quot;[their] prophetic speculations became more and more extreme&quot;. It was at Albury that M‘Neile first met Edward Irving (1792–1834). Irving was a strong believer in the &quot;gifts&quot; of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; (&quot;glossolalia&quot;) and spiritual healing. It was through Irving that M‘Neile first encountered the Irish-born Okey Sisters. His experience of the deception of Okey Sisters&#x27; reputed speaking in tongues with Irving, and his knowledge of their later association with Elliotson and his mesmerism, and their well-attested fraudulent deception of Elliotson, must have strongly informed his later views of the activities of magnetists such as Lafontaine.

In relation to the reputed prophecy, glossolalia and healing, M‘Neile became increasingly torn between his own developing view that they were not of the Holy Spirit of and his desire to remain loyal to Drummond who thought that they were. In the early 1830s, while still within the &quot;Prophetic Circle&quot;, M‘Neile had dabbled with spiritual healing and speaking with tongues himself.

By July 1832, M‘Neile was preaching at Albury against the reputed spiritual gifts and was protesting about Drummond&#x27;s private prayer meetings, because, equating Drummond&#x27;s residence to a church, M‘Neile &quot;would not suffer laymen to pray in his presence&quot;. Further, he most strongly objected &quot;[that] it was not of God&quot; when a female at one of Drummond&#x27;s prayer sessions, which M‘Neile had &quot;attended reluctantly&quot;, spoke in tongues – and, thus, &quot;contradicting the biblical injunction against women teaching in church&quot;. This caused such a rift that Drummond said &quot;if [M‘Neile] persisted in preaching against the work of the Lord and against all who believed in it&quot; he would be unable to remain within the Church of England. Soon after, Drummond ceased attending services at Albury. Their relationship became so unworkable that M‘Neile resigned his post in June 1834.
In October 1834, at the suggestion of a friend, the Revd William Dalton (1801–1880), he was appointed to St Jude&#x27;s Church, Liverpool. The church, which had been built by subscription expressly for Dalton in 1831, could comfortably hold 1,500 people (it was demolished in 1966). At St Jude&#x27;s, M‘Neile had &quot;a handsome salary&quot; and &quot;a very large and opulent congregation&quot;. Once installed at St Jude&#x27;s, M‘Neile&#x27;s eloquence attracted the attention of the Bishop of Chester – John Sumner (1780–1862), later Archbishop of Canterbury – who appointed him as an honorary canon of his cathedral. The next Bishop of Chester, John Graham (1794–1865), also held the important and influential ecclesiastical position of Clerk of the Closet to Queen Victoria. Graham was equally impressed with M‘Neile and possibly used his connections to facilitate the conferral of the Incorporate D.D. upon him in 1860.

Later, at St Paul&#x27;s, a 2,000 plus seat church specifically built for him and consecrated on 2 March 1848 by John Bird Sumner, then Archbishop of Canterbury elect (it closed in 1974) he enjoyed a large income. Over time, M‘Neile became a rich man and his financial independence meant that he answered to none: &quot;McNeile was a fighter by instinct and a political parson by principle and, supported by a confidence derived from considerable personal wealth, he was his own man.&quot;
His stipend at St Paul&#x27;s was £1,000 per annum, more than twelve times that of an average curate. He also received £1,500 per annum in pew rents: &quot;He had a large following, and his capacity to imbue popular prejudice against Roman Catholicism with the dignity of a spiritual crusade gave him enormous and explosive influence on Merseyside.&quot;

== Roman Catholicism and the Anglo-Catholics ==
In the simplest terms, the doctrines and the rituals peculiar to the Anglo-Catholics were considered, by Evangelicals such as M‘Neile, to be a blatant violations of the promise that all of the Anglican clergy routinely made: viz., to adhere to the forms of service as specified in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; – in particular, to what it demanded and what it disallowed – and to adhere to the &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion&quot;.

For M‘Neile, Roman Catholicism endangered &quot;Britain’s providential mission to defend and propagate reformed Christianity&quot;: this &quot;providential mission&quot; was a mission of &quot;nationalism&quot; – a concept &quot;contain[ing] an inherent conviction of objective national superiority&quot; – rather than one of &quot;patriotism&quot; (Wolffe, 1991, pp. 308–309).

The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, enacted principally to avert the threat of religious civil war in Ireland, abolished many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics that had operated in the United Kingdom for more than a century. This distressed many Anglicans such as M‘Neile, who were already fighting against the influence of Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England.
::&quot;As the Tractarian movement in the Church of England developed, M‘Neile became one of its most zealous opponents and the most conspicuous leader of the evangelical party. In 1840, he published &quot;Lectures on the Church of England&quot; and in 1846 (the year after John Henry Newman&#x27;s secession to Rome), &quot;The Church and the Churches&quot;, in which he maintained with much dialectical skill the evangelical doctrine of the &quot;invisible Church&quot; in opposition to the teaching of Newman and Pusey&quot; (McNeile, 1911, p. 265).

In April 1845, when speaking in the House of Commons on the Maynooth Endowment Bill, Thomas Macaulay characterized M‘Neile as &quot;the most powerful representative of uncompromising Protestant opinion in the country&quot; (McNeile, 1911, p. 265).

== Politician ==
In a political speech in 1834, M‘Neile expressed his opinion on the oft-expressed view that clerics should stand aside from politics: &quot;It was said that ministers of religion should not mingle in politics; but God, when he made the minister, did not unmake the citizen.&quot; A &quot;big, impetuous, eloquent Irishman with a marvellously attractive personality and a magnificent voice&quot;, he had a considerable influence on the developing religious and political life of Liverpool:
In 1835, M‘Neile entered a long dispute, in which he was eventually successful, with the Liverpool corporation, which had been captured by the Whigs, after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act. A proposal was carried that the elementary schools under the control of the corporation should be secularised by the introduction of what was known as the Irish National System. The threatened withdrawal of the Bible as the basis of denominational religious teaching was met by agitation led by McNeile, who so successfully enlisted public support that before the new system could be introduced every child was provided for in new Church of England schools established by public subscriptions. At the same time, M‘Neile conducted a campaign that gradually reduced the Whig element in the council until it virtually disappeared in 1841. The defeat of the Liberal parliamentary candidates in the general election of 1837, followed by a long period of Conservative predominance in Liverpool politics, was largely due to his influence.

== Orator ==
&quot;His eloquence was grave, flowing, emphatic – had a dignity in delivery, a perfection of elocution, that only John Bright equalled in the latter half of the 19th century. Its fire was solemn force. McNeile&#x27;s voice was probably the finest organ ever heard in public oratory. His action was as graceful as it was expressive&quot;. According to one observer, M‘Neile was &quot;the most brilliant and highly-polished compound of natural and artificial advantages which I have ever beheld&quot;; and, &quot;as a specimen of appropriate action, refined oratory, stern, judicious argument, and commanding talent, all combined in one majestic whole, I may say M‘Neile is incomparable and perfectly unique&quot; (Anon, 1838d).

M‘Neile was a tenacious, dogged, relentless, and formidable foe; and, along with his extreme verbal aggression, he was a man of the most imposing physicality. He was at least 6 ft 3in tall, thick-set, and broad shouldered. He walked with a slight stoop:
::He has all the appearance of a man of surpassing muscular power. The very aspect of his countenance bespeaks a person of great mental decision, and of unbounded confidence in his bodily strength. He is just such a person as, were a stranger meeting him in the streets, would be at once set down as a man who could, should ever the occasion arise, distinguish himself in any physical-force exhibition. No footpad would ever think of encountering the reverend gentleman, lest he should come off second best in the scuffle that would be sure to ensue. (Grant, 1841, pp.244–245)

== Preacher ==

There were several extraordinary aspects of his preaching, and of the pulpit from which he preached. Almost without exception, and entirely removed from the firmly established Anglican convention, M‘Neile never preached from notes; and always preached extemporaneously. His sermons routinely lasted 90 minutes; and were never measured, structured appeals to reason – they were outright, impassioned histrionic performances intentionally directed at the emotions of his audience:
::&quot;I shall never go to hear Mr. M‘Neile again&quot;, said a religious friend of ours, returning from St. Jude’s.
::&quot;Why not?&quot;, we inquired.
::&quot;Because&quot;, replied he, &quot;if I agree with him, I must come away with feelings of ill-will against parties he has been assailing and who are quite as respectable and intelligent as himself; or, otherwise, I must come away with sentiments of anger towards himself for his intolerance, if I do not agree with him; and I do not choose to go to a place of worship with the liability of leaving it in such an unchristian-like state of mind in either case&quot;.

=== M‘Neile&#x27;s flawed hermeneutics ===
M‘Neile was well known for his flawed hermeneutics; viz., his inaccurate interpretation of Biblical texts. He was renowned for both his inaccurate exegesis, and for his eisegetical projections of Biblical texts onto current events.

For example, in July 1846, Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband, Prince Albert, visited Liverpool and, among other duties on 31 July 1846, he officially opened the Albert Dock and laid the foundation stone for one of M‘Neile&#x27;s pet projects, the Liverpool Sailors&#x27; Home.

Two days later, on 2 August 1846, M‘Neile preached a sermon, &quot;Every eye shall see Him&quot;; the text of which was immediately published.

Within his sermon – regarded, overall, as a &quot;most melancholy, wretched, and most degrading composition&quot; – M‘Neile moved to speak of &quot;The Prince in all his beauty&quot;, mapping Prince Albert&#x27;s laying of a foundation stone onto a text from Isaiah (33:17) &quot;Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty&quot;

There were many protests at his equation of &quot;the Saviour of the world&quot; with a &quot;colonel of hussars&quot; and his implicit assertion that Albert held &quot;title-deeds to… divinity&quot; (Anon, 1847h). It was clear his &quot;fearful irreverence&quot; – implying that &quot;an earthly prince&quot; visiting Liverpool had some link to &quot;the awful coming of the Prince of Heaven and Earth to Judgment&quot; – was something that &quot;must be [immediately] apparent to every reverent mind&quot;; and, further, that a &quot;piece of gross and rank blasphemy [was perpetrated] by making the third Person of the Holy Trinity a type of Prince Albert&quot;.

=== M‘Neile&#x27;s immoderate preaching ===
Another extraordinary aspect was his propensity for &quot;[being] carried away into confessedly injudicious acts and words, which many would wish unsaid,
undone&quot; (Arnold, 1875, p. 307). On 28 February 1847, he preached that the Irish Famine was an act of God&#x27;s retribution, punishing the Irish for their collective sins and their tolerance of Roman Catholicism.

On the morning of 8 December 1850, when throwing &quot;thunderbolts&quot; at one of his favourite targets, the evils of the Roman Catholic confessional, M‘Neile made a series of outrageous statements of which, immediately after his sermon had been delivered, he denied any knowledge of ever having uttered;
and, for which he specifically apologized at the evening service, and withdrew without reservation, as the following newspaper account relates:

In 1851, these events were also presented as a classic example of &quot;the dangers of extempore preaching&quot; (Gilbert, 1851, p. 10).

=== M‘Neile&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Agency and Mesmerism&quot; sermon ===

On the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, M‘Neile preached against Mesmerism for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation. He began, speaking of &quot;latter days&quot; – following which, Christ would return to Earth, and peace would reign for 1,000 years – and how, as the second advent neared, &quot;satanic agency amongst men&quot; would become ever more obvious; and, then, moving into a confusing admixture of philippic (against James Braid and Charles Lafontaine), and polemic (against animal magnetism), where he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to &quot;satanic agency&quot;. The sermon was reported on at some length in the &quot;Liverpool Standard&quot;, two days later. Once Braid became fully aware of the newspaper reports of the conglomeration of matters that were reportedly raised in M‘Neile&#x27;s sermon, and the misrepresentations and outright errors of fact that it allegedly contained, as well as the vicious nature of the insults, and the implicit and explicit threats which were levelled against Braid&#x27;s own personal, spiritual, and professional well-being by M‘Neile, he sent a detailed private letter to M‘Neile accompanied by a newspaper account of a lecture he had delivered on the preceding Wednesday evening (13 April) at Macclesfield, and a cordial invitation (plus a free admission ticket) for M‘Neile to attend Braid&#x27;s Liverpool lecture, on Thursday, 21 April.

Yet, despite Braid&#x27;s courtesy, in raising his deeply felt concerns directly to M‘Neile, in private correspondence, M‘Neile did not acknowledge Braid&#x27;s letter nor did he attend Braid&#x27;s lecture. Further, in the face of all the evidence Braid had presented, and seemingly, &quot;without the slightest correction of its original contents&quot;, M‘Neile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as it had been transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842. It was this &#x27;most ungentlemanly&#x27; act of M‘Neile towards Braid, that forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842; a pamphlet which, in Crabtree&#x27;s opinion is &quot;a work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity&quot; (1988, p. 121).

Aside from the newspaper reports of the M&#x27;Neile&#x27;s actual sermon, there were at least twelve published responses to the published version of the sermon and its contents.

== Dean of Ripon ==
M&#x27;Neile was in close sympathy with the philanthropic work, as well as the religious views, of the Earl of Shaftesbury, who tried hard to persuade Lord Palmerston to make him a bishop. Although Palmerston usually followed the advice of Shaftesbury in the appointment of bishops, he would not consent to the elevation to the House of Lords of so powerful a political opponent as M&#x27;Neile, whom Lord John Russell had accused of frustrating the education policy of the Liberal Party for thirty years.

On 13 August 1868, William Goode, the Dean of Ripon, the senior Anglican cleric in the Diocese of Ripon after the Bishop of Ripon, died suddenly.

On 14 August, Disraeli wrote to Queen Victoria, recommending that the Queen immediately appoint M&#x27;Neile to the vacancy, arguing in support of his case that, &quot;at this critical conjuncture [M&#x27;Neile] is gaining golden opinions all over England for his eloquent, learned and commanding advocacy of the Royal supremacy …&quot; (Buckle (1926a), p. 533). The Queen&#x27;s detailed response, written on her behalf by Major General Sir Thomas Myddleton Biddulph, the joint Keeper of the Privy Purse, spoke directly of her reluctance:
In his response, written on 19 August, Disraeli replied that he had only recommended M‘Neile after the most anxious and deep consideration. Further, and given that he was being subjected to considerable pressure to elevate M‘Neile from a number of quarters (including &quot;the vast number of letters [Disraeli] daily receives on the subject&quot;), he strongly advised the Queen to appoint M‘Neile to the Deanery of Ripon, on the basis that he (Disraeli) had consulted the Lord Chancellor (Hugh Cairns, M‘Neile&#x27;s nephew by marriage) &quot;on this matter&quot;, and that Cairns was &quot;very strongly in favour of the appointment&quot;.

He also indicated to the Queen that, in his view, and regardless of her declared reservations, such an appointment was prudent: &quot;the step … would be favourably received by the High Church party [viz., &#x27;faction&#x27;], who feel that the claims of Canon McNeile cannot be overlooked&quot;; and, more significantly, he noted that, if he were to be &quot;overlooked&quot; at this time, the pressures might become such that if he were to be &quot;passed over&quot; at this time, he might well gain an even &quot;higher preferment&quot; than the Dean of Ripon.

M‘Neile was hurriedly appointed to the vacancy at Rippon, and was installed on 29 October 1868.

He served in that position until he retired due to ill health on 31 October 1875.

== M‘Neile’s statue ==
Following his installation as the Dean of Ripon (on 29 October 1868), M‘Neile made his last speech in Liverpool on 4 November 1868. A group of his friends and parishioners, &quot;having resolved to erect a full-length marble statue of him in Liverpool, in commemoration of his many valuable and long-continued services in the cause of religion and religious education&quot;, announced the next day that they were accepting donations to the Statue Fund, the maximum contributions to which were fixed at £5.

In May the following year, the statue committee announced that its target amount had been reached and that an eminent sculptor, George Gammon Adams, had been commissioned to produce the work and that Adams had already had several sittings with M‘Neile. The statue was carved from a pure white 8-ton block of Italian Carrara marble (the same marble as Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;).

Adams took 18 months to finish the , 3-ton statue; and it was finished in mid-October. On 28 October 1870, the Liverpool Council considered a request from the McNeile Statue Committee &quot;that the statue be accepted for placement in St George’s Hall&quot; (Cavanagh, 1997, p. 281). The suggestion it should place a statue of M‘Neile in such a conspicuous place of honour, &quot;produced an acrimonious discussion&quot;; and, given the fierce objections by a considerable number present, the subject was deferred, for the simple reason that every statue that had been placed in St. George&#x27;s Hall up to that time, had been accepted by a unanimous vote.

At the next meeting, on 9 November 1870, the first chaired by the new Lord Mayor, Joseph Gibbons Livingston (who was a strong supporter of M‘Neile), various motions were put, various amendments were proposed, and a number of very strongly held views were expressed. Despite the convention requiring a unanimous vote, it seems the majority (the final vote was 36 &quot;aye&quot; to 16 &quot;nay&quot;) were prepared to take the view that, whatever divisive conduct M‘Neile may have displayed, he deserved recognition as a writer and orator, and agreed to place the statue amongst the other eleven local and national dignitaries (Cavanagh, 1977).

The established Liverpool custom was a public unveiling, with &quot;the most prestigious guest available invited to officiate&quot;. These were great popular occasions, wherein &quot;extended eulogies [were] delivered by the succession of committee-members and honoured guests&quot;, reports of which were &quot;invariably peppered with the parenthetic &quot;cheers&quot;, &quot;hear-hears&quot;, &quot;applause&quot; and, even, &quot;loud and extended applause&quot; from crowds that attendant reporters frequently emphasized &quot;encompassed all classes and creeds&quot; (Cavanagh, 1997, p.xvi). Yet, in the case of M‘Neile&#x27;s statue, it was brought to Liverpool and placed on its pedestal in the dark of night, and was unveiled &quot;without any ceremonial&quot; in St. George&#x27;s Hall, three days later, on the evening of Monday, 5 December, in the presence of the Mayor, the chairman, secretary, and other several members of the Statue Committee, several &quot;ladies&quot;, M‘Neile&#x27;s son, the Revd Edmund Hugh M‘Neile (who took over St. Paul&#x27;s, Princes Park from his father) and the Revd Dyson Rycroft, Honorary Canon of Liverpool.

Often, according to the established Liverpool custom, the sculptor would be present; and, on occasion, the sculptor might even deliver a short speech. In the case of M‘Neile&#x27;s statue, the sculptor was the only one to speak; and, moreover, Adams had to unveil M‘Neile&#x27;s statue himself.

The final irony is that, of all the statues, &quot;the only statue in St George’s Hall to cause offence because of the character of its subject, is also the only statue to have received unanimous acclaim as a work of art&quot; (Cavanagh, 1997, p. 282):
::Mr. G.G. Adams, the artist who has given us the one good statue in St George’s Hall. … People may quarrel with the objects of the promoters of the memorial, but no one can withhold a tribute of admiration to the rare ability of the sculptor. (&quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;, 15 December 1870).

== Death ==
M‘Neile died in Bournemouth on 28 January 1879 after a short illness.

He was interred in the midst of a severe snowstorm at Bournemouth New Cemetery on 1 February 1879. The funeral ceremony was officiated by the Bishop of Peterborough (his nephew, William Connor Magee (1821–1891)), assisted by his son, the Revd Edmund M‘Neile (1840–1893).

Earl Cairns (1810–1885), who was related to M&#x27;Neile through his marriage to M&#x27;Neile&#x27;s niece, Mary Harriet M&#x27;Neile (1833–1919), and Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885) were amongst the mourners. Throughout the day the muffled minute bell of Ripon Cathedral was tolled and the cathedral&#x27;s lectern and pulpit were each covered with a black cloth.

<text>Hugo F.V. Coveliers (born 21 February 1947) is a retired Belgian politician and lawyer. He was a member of the Belgian Chamber of People&#x27;s Representatives between 1985 and 1995, and from 1993 to 2003. Since 2003, he has been a member of the Belgian Senate. He was a parliamentary chairman for the VLD in both chambers, from 1999 to 2003.

==Biography==
Coveliers was born in Schelle, Flemish Community, Belgium, on 21 February 1947. As a student he came into contact with the Flemish Movement. Coveliers became a member of the Young Flemish Student Community and at the University of Ghent he was a member of the &quot;Vlaams-Nationale Studentenunie&quot; for two years. From his period in the humanities he was involved in the youth section of the People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Volksunie&quot;), a Flemish nationalist party, of which he was the chairman from 1974 to 1976. He was also a municipal councilor of Antwerp from 1974 to 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he was chairman of the Volksunie section of the Antwerp district. He later changed to the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) in 1992, together with some other frustrated party members. Within the VLD, he was part of the conservative wing, and he was open to the idea of working with the Vlaams Belang (&quot;Flemish Interest&quot;) and its precursor Vlaams Blok (&quot;Flemish Bloc&quot;), something the VLD&#x27;s leadership did not support.

In 2004, Coveliers was co-founder of the Antwerp section of the conservative-libertarian organization Nova Civitas and became inspired and influenced by Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn. At that time he also feuded openly with VLD party chairman Karel De Gucht. This resulted in Coveliers being ejected from the party on 8 February 2005, and starting his own political party VLOTT in the fall of 2005, based on Fortuyn&#x27;s ideas. This party is willing to work together with the Vlaams Belang (VB) and formed a cartel with it for the Antwerp city elections in October 2006.

After the dismissal of Jean-Marie Dedecker from the VLD, Coveliers, Dedecker and Boudewijn Bouckaert (and other Nova Civitas members) started negotiations to form a new right-wing liberal party. Coveliers and members of VLOTT formed a cartel with VB, therefore appearing on VB&#x27;s lists in the 2007 general election. 

Coveliers withdrew from active politics early 2012.

<doc id="1165093" wikidata="Q1750203" url="?curid=1165093" title="North British Railway">
<text>The North British Railway was a British railway company, based in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was established in 1844, with the intention of linking with English railways at Berwick. The line opened in 1846, and from the outset the company followed a policy of expanding its geographical area, and competing with the Caledonian Railway in particular. In doing so it committed huge sums of money, and incurred shareholder disapproval that resulted in two chairmen leaving the company.

Nonetheless, the company successfully reached Carlisle, where it later made a partnership with the Midland Railway. It also linked from Edinburgh to Perth and Dundee, but for many years the journey involved a ferry crossing of the Forth and the Tay. Eventually the North British built the Tay Bridge, but the structure collapsed as a train was crossing in high wind. The company survived the setback and opened a second Tay Bridge, followed soon by the Forth Bridge, which together transformed the railway network north of Edinburgh.

Early on, mineral traffic became dominant and brought in much more revenue than the passenger services.

At the grouping of the railways in 1923, the North British Railway was the largest railway company in Scotland, and the fifth largest in the United Kingdom. In that year it became a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway.

==First steps==

Early railways in Scotland had been mainly involved with conveyance of minerals, chiefly coal and limestone in the earliest times, a short distance to a river or coastal harbour for onward transport. The opening of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&amp;GR) in 1842 showed that a longer distance general purpose railway could be commercially successful.

During the construction of the E&amp;GR, the money market had eased somewhat and a rapid development of long-distance railways took place in England. Scottish promoters began to consider how central Scotland could be connected to the growing English network, and a government commission was established to determine the approved route. It was assumed for some time that only a single route was commercially viable. The commission, the Smith-Barlow Commission, deliberated for some time and presented an ambiguous report, and public opinion had moved on: numerous schemes for railways were proposed, not all of them practicable.
During this frenzy, a group of businesspeople formed the North British Railway Company to build a line from Edinburgh to Berwick (later named Berwick-on-Tweed) with a branch to Haddington. They got their authorising act of Parliament, the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. lxvi). The Newcastle and Berwick Railway was building its line, and in time they would form part of a through chain of railways between Edinburgh and London.

==Early plans==
This had been a race against competing railways: the main competitor was the Caledonian Railway, which planned to build from both Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle, there linking with English railways that were building northwards. However the Caledonian was unable to secure enough subscriptions to present a bill to Parliament in 1844 and held over to the following year.

The chairman of the North British Railway, John Learmonth, saw that capturing as much territory as possible for the North British was essential in the competitive struggle. He prepared plans to build a second main line from Edinburgh to Carlisle through Hawick, and also attempted to gain control of the Edinburgh and Perth Railway company, which was itself preparing plans for its line. In the 1845 session of Parliament Learmonth secured authorising acts of Parliament for numerous branch lines, mostly to forestall incursion by competitors. In addition, the first part of the line to Carlisle, the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, was authorised: it was nominally independent, but in fact the shares were all owned by Learmonth and other NBR directors. Also in the 1845 session, the Caledonian Railway was authorised. The Caledonian was to prove a bitter rival. The Edinburgh and Perth Railway failed to get parliamentary authorisation.

The line to Hawick was to use the route of the obsolescent Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway, a horse-operated line with a non-standard gauge of sleeper-block track, and a large sum had to be allocated to converting that line to main line standards.

==Opening of the main line==
All these plans for expansion were committing huge sums of money even before the main line was ready. At last on 22 June 1846 the line to Berwick and Haddington was open to the public. There were five trains daily, with an additional ten short journeys between Edinburgh and Musselburgh. A Sunday service was operated, in the face of considerable opposition from those of a religious point of view.

At first the Newcastle and Berwick Railway was not ready, and passengers and goods to London had to be conveyed by road from Berwick to Newcastle. From 1 July 1847 it was open between Tweedmouth (opposite Berwick on the south side of the River Tweed) and Newcastle upon Tyne. The North British Railway was able to advertise a train service from Edinburgh to London, although passengers and goods needed to be conveyed by road across the Tweed at Berwick, and across the River Tyne at Newcastle: the two river bridges were still under construction. It was not until 1850 that the permanent bridges were inaugurated, by Queen Victoria, although some working over temporary structures had already taken place.

==The Edinburgh station==
The station at Edinburgh was located in a depression between the Old and New Towns; this had early been a disreputable and insanitary swamp called the Nor&#x27; Loch, although steps had been taken to provide ornamental gardens on part of the area. The North British Railway obtained a cramped site close to the North Bridge, and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway extended their line from their terminus at Haymarket to meet the NBR. The new station was operated jointly, and was simply called &quot;the Edinburgh station&quot; or &quot;the North Bridge station&quot;. It also came to be referred to as &quot;the General station&quot;, and much later it was named &quot;Waverley station&quot;.

==A takeover offer from George Hudson==
The English railway entrepreneur George Hudson was expanding his portfolio of railways and in 1847 his York and Newcastle Railway and the Newcastle and Berwick Railway were close to completing the English portion of a route from London to Edinburgh. Hudson made an offer to purchase the North British Railway (through the medium of his own companies) for 8% on the NBR capital. Hudson&#x27;s offer placed a high value on the NBR, but it was rejected by the North British Railway shareholders on the advice of their chairman.

==The Hawick line==
Parliament had declined to authorised the NBR line throughout to Carlisle, and for the time being Hawick was to be the southern terminus, although the plan to construct to Carlisle later was made manifest. As the Edinburgh end was to use the old Edinburgh and Dalkeith alignment, some connections between the NBR and that line had to be made, as well as the upgrading of the E&amp;DR line, doubling the single line section beyond Dalkeith, and construction of a new viaduct over the River South Esk and Dalhousie.

After the NBR had formally purchased the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, first openings took place in 1847 but it was not until 1 November 1849 that the line was open throughout to Hawick. For the time being Learmonth&#x27;s objective of a line reaching Carlisle, which was later to become the Waverley Route, was on hold.

==Early branches==
The NBR obtained authority in a 1846 act of Parliament to build numerous branches off its main line and off the Hawick line. Not all of these were built, but in addition to the Haddington branch, which had opened contemporaneously with the main line, several were opened in the period to 1855. These were:

* a branch to Musselburgh, formed by extending the E&amp;DR Fisherrow branch across the River Esk; this opened on 16 July 1847; Fisherrow was reduced to goods status only, and the Musselburgh station on the main line was renamed Inveresk;
* a short mineral branch to Tranent, opened in 1849;
* the North Berwick branch from Drem, opened in 1850;
* the Dunse branch line, opened in 1849; Dunse was later spelt Duns;
* a branch to Kelso from St Boswells on the Hawick line, opened in 1850.

==Competition==
The Caledonian Railway had been able to offer a through rail service without change of train via Carstairs since March 1848. The fastest trains between Edinburgh and London on both routes then took a little over hours; the East Coast journey included the two transshipments, at the Tweed and the Tyne. and the cheaper steamship service between Leith and London still took the bulk of the passenger traffic.

Mineral traffic, in particular coal from the Lothian coalfield, was the largest source of revenue, although delivery to the West Coast harbours and the developing iron smelting industry in the Monklands was problematical.

==The fall of Learmonth==
The Chairman of the North British Railway was John Learmonth. From the outset he had seen that expansion of the North British Railway was the way forward, and with allies on the Board he had invested heavily, both personally and through the company, in subscriptions to other railways. In some cases this was to extend the system profitably, but in many it was simply to keep rival lines, especially the Caledonian Railway, out. For some time shareholder opinion was with him, but over time disquiet took hold when the scale of the commitments was disclosed. In 1851, North British Railway £25 shares were trading at £6 (). At a shareholders meeting in 1851 it was pointed out that when the company&#x27;s network had been 89 miles in extent revenue had been £39,304. Now the network was 146 miles and revenue was £39,967 (). Huge sums were being written off in failed ventures, while equally huge sums were being sought for new ones. Some shareholders remembered George Hudson&#x27;s offer of 8% for the company in 1847, which had been refused. It was noted that the Caledonian Railway was equally determined to enlarge its system, but was doing so by leasing smaller companies, avoiding a large payment at the beginning.

In early 1852, a new preference share issue failed, and at the Shareholders&#x27; meeting in March two directors resigned, and Learmonth was forced to declare that he too would go in due course. This was hardly a tenable position and on 13 May 1852 he resigned. James Balfour took over, but Balfour was not well suited to the role and he had little influence on the course of the North British. He too left the company, and in 1855 Richard Hodgson took over. His task was formidable; no dividend was paid to ordinary shareholders for some time.
By September 1856, Hodgson had routed an opposing faction on the board, and operating expenses were down to 44%. At a special shareholders&#x27; meeting on 15 July 1856 he announced that the company&#x27;s money bill had been passed as the (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. lxiii), enabling the company to issue shares and to pay down debt with the money raised: he announced, somewhat prematurely, that the company was free from debt. The Ordinary Shareholders would get a dividend of 2.5%.

==Lines in the Borders==
In April 1856, the independent Selkirk and Galashiels Railway opened its line, to be worked by the NBR; this was followed in July 1856 by the Jedburgh Railway, connecting with the NBR at Roxburgh and also worked by the NBR. The Selkirk line was absorbed by the NBR in 1859, and the Jedburgh Railway in 1860.

Hodgson reiterated Learmonth&#x27;s statement that extending from Hawick to Carlisle was a priority. The water was muddied by the Caledonian Railway&#x27;s stated intention to build its own branch from Carlisle to Hawick, and then by the independent Border Counties Railway. This was a speculative line from Hexham, on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, striking north into presumed mineral-rich areas. It was authorised in 1854, and opened as far as Chollerford in 1858; its significance was the potential to enter the area between Carlisle and Hawick: in 1857 it presented a bill to Parliament to join the Hawick line. That was not successful, but Hodgson caused the NBR shareholders to vote £450,000 () for the Carlisle extension from Hawick; such was his power of persuasion. However the bill presented to Parliament in the 1858 session was rejected, as was a competing Caledonian Railway Bill.

Hodgson used the mutual rebuff to try to form an alliance with the Caledonian, building and operating the line jointly. His objective was obviously to achieve access through Carlisle southwards, but the Caledonian saw through that and turned him down. The NBR presented a fresh bill for the Carlisle line in the 1859 session. Hodgson had agreed a takeover arrangement with the moribund Port Carlisle Dock and Railway Company and the Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway and Dock Company. These lines had a Carlisle station, a connecting line to the Caledonian Railway at Carlisle Citadel station, and a west coast port, at Silloth. On 21 July 1859 the act of Parliament, the Border Union (North British) Railways Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. xxiv), for the Carlisle Extension (now labelled the Border Union Railway) and the act of Parliament permitting the acquisition of the Carlisle minor railways received royal assent. On the same day the Border Counties Railway was authorised; it had been supported by Hodgson, who saw access to Newcastle independently of the North Eastern Railway. It was absorbed by the NBR in 1860.

The construction of the Border Union Railway was slow; goods operation from Carlisle to Scotch Dyke, not far from Longtown, started on 11 October 1861, and the entire line was opened for goods trains on 23 June 1862 and for passengers on 1 July 1862. The Border Counties Railway opened throughout on the same dates. The Border Counties joined the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (N&amp;CR) at Hexham. The North Eastern Railway wished to absorb the N&amp;CR, and the NBR agreed to withdraw its opposition in an exchange of running powers. The NBR acquired the powers over the BCR line into Newcastle. This seemed a hugely important goal, although the route over the two Borders lines was long and arduous. The exchange was that the NER got running powers from Berwick to Edinburgh. If Hodgson believed that this was an equitable exchange, he was soon rid of the belief, for the NER was now able to run through line goods and passenger trains right in to Edinburgh on the main line.

Hodgson&#x27;s faith in the Carlisle connection was equally ill-founded; facilities for through bookings and working south of Carlisle were refused. The capital commitment again swamped the financial resources of the company and the dividend sank to 1%.

The Border Union Line, which soon became known as the Waverley Route opened in stages from 1861, opening throughout on 1 August 1862. There was limited intermediate population, and the Caledonian Railway frustrated attempts to arrange through workings, or even through bookings, for passengers, and goods traffic was diverted away from the NBR. The NBR made use of its fortuitous connection to Silloth to ship goods onwards, but for the time being the line was of doubtful value considering its expense. It was not until the Midland Railway completed the Settle and Carlisle line in 1875 (for goods: passenger traffic started in 1876), that the North British had a willing English partner at Carlisle.

After two years of construction, the Berwickshire Railway opened part of its line from St Boswells to Dunse (later spelt Duns) in 1865. The line was worked by the NBR and formed a continuous route with the earlier Dunse branch. The Berwickshire Railway was heavily supported by the NBR, probably as a strategic measure to keep the Caledonian Railway out of the district. The NBR absorbed it in 1876.

==Acquisitions again==
Due to Hodgson&#x27;s improved management in the period to 1862, the financial position was greatly improved. Dividends on ordinary shares up to 3% became regular.

Geographical expansion was limited to funding the parliamentary deposits of prospective friendly branch line companies, with provisional agreements to work their lines. Some changes to the Dalkeith line connections around Edinburgh were made, including feeding the Leith line and the Musselburgh line directly from the main line at Portobello and Wanton Walls respectively.

From July 1861, the Peebles Railway line was leased. In 1862, a greater prize was acquired: the Edinburgh and Northern Railway had expanded from its origins and now, as the Edinburgh, Perth And Dundee Railway, it connected the places in its title, albeit with a ferry crossing of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay. The EP&amp;DR also had a branch from Stirling to Dunfermline, through highly productive coalfields, and it had already absorbed the Fife and Kinross Railway and the Kinross-shire Railway. In the same year the North British absorbed the West of Fife Railway and Harbour Company, giving further access to mineral-bearing areas and to Charlestown Harbour.

==1864 to 1866: a buoyant start, then disaster==
Since the full opening of the Border Union Railway, passenger trains had terminated at the Canal station of the Port Carlisle Railway. By 1864 the line was double track throughout and from 1 July 1864 the passenger trains were diverted over the Caledonian Railway connecting line, to terminate in Citadel station. The financial position was somewhat better and a 2% dividend on ordinary shares was announced in August. There was more excitement to come: the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had for years seemed to be on the point of joining in with the Caledonian Railway, but now it seemed that it, together with the Monkland Railways, would join the NBR. The Edinburgh and Glasgow had a considerable system, including the Stirling to Dunfermline line and the Bathgate and Morningside line; moreover it was working the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway. The Monkland Railways had been formed in 1848 by the merging of several of the old &quot;coal railways&quot; operating around Airdrie and Coatbridge. Their main business was still mineral traffic, and although their operating costs were high, they made a comfortable profit.

On 4 July 1865, an act of Parliament, the Edinburgh and Glasgow and Monkland Railways Amalgamation Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccxvii) was passed authorising the merger and it took place on 31 July between the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and the Monkland Railways, and the following day the merged company was absorbed by the North British. Although some commentators had expected that the E&amp;GR might have absorbed the NBR, the reality was that the new board consisted of 13 former NBR directors and two E&amp;G men. The NBR habitually ran trains on Sundays and started doing so on the E&amp;GR main line, which had not. This ignited fresh protests from Sabbatarians but the NBR stuck to its position on the matter.

As well as the railways mentioned, the merger gave the North British a share of the City of Glasgow Union Railway which was then under construction. When complete, that line would give the North British access shipping berths on the Clyde at General Terminus over the General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway.

The NBR grew to have, by the summer of 1865, about of route, almost equally divided between double- and single-track. In addition it was working another of single track for independent companies.

In 1866, comparison with the Caledonian Railway showed that company to be in better shape:


In the spring of 1866, Hodgson declared a 3% dividend on ordinary shares, but the share price continued to decline. In the Autumn of 1866 Hodgson was again proposing a dividend of 3% but a new company secretary, John Walker, alerted the finance committee to the true state of the NBR&#x27;s finances. A new preference share issue had flopped, and it proved impossible to pay debenture interest and preference share guaranteed dividends. Evidently it was intended to pay the dividend out of new capital; North British ordinary shares fell overnight by 8% after this revelation. Widespread financial impropriety and falsification of accounts were disclosed, all laid at Hodgson&#x27;s door, and this was reported to a Special General Meeting on 14 November 1866.

Hodgson did not attend; instead he sent a letter of resignation, and blamed bad headaches for preventing him from being present. John Balfour, the former chairman, took the chair for the meeting. The Committee of enquiry submitted a lengthy report, which included the statement that there had been

not merely deliberate falsification of the accounts from year to year so as to show to the shareholders and divide among them a revenue which was not in existence and was known not to have been earned; but it was a careful and most ingenious fabrication of imaginary accounts, begun and carried on from time to time for the purpose of supporting the falsified half yearly statements of revenue and the general misrepresentation of affairs

The board resigned, only four remaining for the sake of continuity, and the previous statement of accounts and the declared dividend were reversed. No dividend was paid and warrants bearing 4% interest &quot;until paid&quot; were issued in their place, The meeting was naturally lengthy and at times stormy; a verbatim report occupied two and a half pages of the Glasgow Herald the next day.

On 12 December 1866, the interim Chairman of the Company published a notice, stating the intention to make a 5.5% preference share issue in the amount of £1,875,625 (), covering all the financial liabilities of the company. On 22 December the Glasgow Herald carried an eight-line report that the interim chairman had stood down, and that John Stirling of Kippendavie had been appointed chairman.

Amid the fireworks of railway management, in 1866 the new line from Monktonhall to Dalkeith via Smeaton opened, as did the Blane Valley Railway. Passenger services on the latter did not start until 1867, in common with the opening of the Esk Valle Railway.

==The North British under Kippendavie==
The company now sought to grow revenues on the existing network. A rapprochement was reached with the Caledonian Railway—Kippendavie came from that railway&#x27;s Board—and commitments to the City of Glasgow Union Railway were eased. (At one time there had been thoughts of the NBR using a considerably expanded terminus on the line in alliance with the Glasgow and South Western Railway, but the cost would have been huge and it was not now possible to proceed.

The Shareholders&#x27; Meeting of 12 September 1867 was told that arrangements had been made to deal with the £1,875,625 () of debt already identified; but

the company are under obligations to construct new lines, involving a further amount of £2,600,000. It s essential to limit this liability... but [the Directors] do not consider an indiscriminate abandonment of works to be desirable. Accordingly provision is made in the Finance Act for constituting certain of the unexpected works into separate undertakings... It is to local parties that the Directors look for subscriptions to construct branch lines, required for the accommodation of particular districts, so that it will in a great measure rest with the local interests, whether or not such works shall be immediately proceeded with.

==Revenue sharing agreement with the Caledonian Railway==
Building on the improved relations with the Caledonian, Kippendavie reached a revenue sharing arrangement with that company on 16 January 1868; the agreement included refrain from opposing time extension on NBR projects that had been delayed by the financial turmoil.

By 1869, the Caledonian and the NBR were once again at loggerheads; the main issue now was the Waverley Route, and the proportion of traffic attributable to it. It emerged that the Caledonian had secretly concluded a pact with the London and North Western Railway in 1867; the arrangement excluded the North British from nearly all goods traffic, and its revelation damaged good feeling: indeed the Caledonian were doing what they could to make the Waverley Route the source of the difficulties. By late 1869 the revenue sharing agreement was a dead letter.

==Financial improvement and branch lines==
From 22 May 1868, the new connection to the former Edinburgh Leith and Granton Railway via Piershill was opened; this gave a more modern, but more circuitous, approach to Granton, still in use for passenger traffic by ferry to Fife, and Leith, correspondingly for goods. The City of Glasgow Union Railway was slow in completing and well over budget; but the NBR hoped to get a decent goods station at College, so commitment was made to building the Coatbridge to Glasgow line. Throughout 1868 steady progress was being made in getting the financial state of the company under control, and from January 1869 it was announced that cash dividends and payment on the warrants would be forthcoming.

In 1870, the Coatbridge to Glasgow line opened, at first to Gallowgate until College station opened in 1871, when the NBR could run a viable Edinburgh to Glasgow passenger service via Airdrie.

==Through running by the North Eastern==
From 1 June 1869, the North Eastern Railway started running its engines through to Edinburgh on passenger trains; the arrangement had been agreed as part of the Border Counties arrangements in 1862. From July, the NER was running all the through passenger trains. The NBR paid the NER one shilling a mile and retained its share of the receipts.

==North to Aberdeen==
The NBR had long aspired to reach Aberdeen independently, and the 1862 acquisition of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway had been a step towards that. An agreement arising from the 1866 amalgamation of the Caledonian Railway and the Scottish North Eastern Railway entitled the NBR to propose a northward line without parliamentary opposition from the Caledonian. Now in November 1870 the NB issued a prospectus for such a line, the North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway; its budget was to be £171,580 (), and it would include the Montrose and Bervie Railway which had opened in 1865.

On 18 August 1872, an act of Parliament was obtained giving authorisation for the absorption by the NBR of the Leslie Railway, a branch line at Markinch.

==Fife lines==
In the west of Fife, early mineral workings had resulted in the establishment of a number of mineral tramways and short railways around Dunfermline. These merged to form the West of Fife Mineral Railway, and that company was absorbed by the NBR in 1862.

With the acquisition of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway in 1862, the NBR had acquired a line to Dunfermline from Thornton, passing through terrain that was rich in coal. When the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was taken over, the NBR also got hold of the Stirling to Dunfermline line, passing through Alloa, and further consolidating its hold on the West Fife coalfield. The bulk of the coal went to Burntisland for export and coastal transport to market. Burntisland had been developed as a ferry port but was increasingly used for export, and had become the most important harbour in Fife.

The eastern area of Fife had developed railways early on in response to fishing and agriculture: mineral development was to follow later, and became hugely significant. The independent St Andrews Railway had opened in 1852 from a junction at Leuchars. The Leven and East of Fife Railway was formed from two earlier railways and ran from Thornton to Leven and Anstruther, but for some time without satisfactory connections to the harbours. Both railways were engineered very cheaply, and while this had facilitated acquiring the funds for construction, it left the lines unable to renew worn-out track, and they both agreed absorption by the NBR in 1877. The agricultural area between the two lines was crossed by the Anstruther and St Andrews Railway, but it too was unable to continue alone and the company agreed to join the NBR in 1883.

As the coal extraction in eastern Fife increased in volume, new pits were opened in areas not previously served by rail, and the NBR was not responsive to the requirements of the coal masters. This dissatisfaction led to the opening in 1881 of the Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway, built independently by the Wemyss family, owners of the land in the area. The Wemyss and Buckhaven line connected to the NBR at Thornton. There were harbours at Leven and Methil immediately adjacent to the East Fife collieries, but the NBR was content to haul the coal to Burntisland, causing further ill feeling, and there was a move to develop Methil Harbour independently. The NBR reluctantly acquiesced and in 1889 took over the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and developed Methil Harbour.

==Proposed amalgamation with the Caledonian==
Relations with the Caledonian Railway were better again, and in the latter half of 1871 the idea of amalgamation took hold. The idea became concrete when the two companies&#x27; boards agreed on the merger on 29 November 1871.

However, the NBR shareholders received this with scepticism; the earlier proposal had been rejected because the NBR share would only be 45.5% of the group revenue; now the board were supporting a scheme that would only give them 39%. It was suggested that the backlog of renewals in the reference year (for calculating the division) disproportionately depressed NBR net revenue.

Shareholder hostility did not die down following the meeting, and on 2 February 1872 the board announced that the proposal would not now be pursued. The Caledonian reacted angrily, saying that, &quot;we shall, no doubt, have a renewal of the old rivalry&quot;.

==Branch lines==
On 18 August 1872, an act of Parliament was obtained giving authorisation for the absorption by the NBR of the insolvent Northumberland Central Railway.

The Penicuik Railway opened in 1872 and the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway opened in stages from 1873; both lines were worked by the NBR. In 1874 the Whiteinch Railway was opened, also worked by the NBR, and after a very lengthy gestation period the Stobcross Railway, a branch of the NBR, opened giving access to the new Queens Dock on the Clyde; the dock itself was also taking a long time in the construction, and it did not open fully until 1877.

On 1 January 1875, the Devon Valley Railway was vested in the NBR.

In 1876, the Peebles Railway was absorbed, as was the Berwickshire Railway and the Penicuik Railway.

On 1 November 1877, the Glasgow, Bothwell, Hamilton and Coatbridge Railway opened, from Shettleston. It was worked by the NBR and in 1878 agreement was reached to absorb it. The long line penetrated into Caledonian Railway territory where coal was plentiful. In February 1878 the North Monkland Railway opened, also primarily intended for mineral working.

In 1879, the Kelvin Valley Railway opened; mainly intended to bring minerals from Kilsyth, it was not welcomed with enthusiasm by the NBR, which nonetheless worked it.

==More financial difficulties==
From 1873 onward, operating costs rose considerably faster than receipts and the NBR discontinued paying a dividend on ordinary shares, the only Scottish railway in this position at the time. A concerted effort was made to get the situation under control, and a 4% dividend was announced at the September 1875 Shareholders&#x27; Meeting.

==Midland Railway access to Carlisle==
In September 1875, the Settle and Carlisle line was opened, at last giving the Midland Railway its own access to Carlisle. The Midland was a natural partner for the North British Railway in forming a competing through route via Carlisle. However, passenger operation had to wait until the following year.

==Crossing the Tay and the Forth==
On 31 May 1877, the Tay Bridge was formally opened. This resulted in a huge realignment of NBR train services; until that date NBR passengers had crossed the Tay by ferry, finally reaching Dundee over the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, aligned to the Caledonian Railway. The Dundee and Arbroath now became jointly owned between the Caledonian and the NBR, as part of parliamentary safeguarding of the NBR&#x27;s ultimately semi-independent route to Aberdeen.

The triumph turned to disaster on 28 December 1879 when the bridge collapsed while a train was crossing it, killing all 74 or 75 in the Tay. As well as the human tragedy, this was a huge shock to the North British Railway, which was planning the construction of a Forth Bridge at the time, enabling it finally to get an independent line from Edinburgh to Dundee. The Company resolved immediately to rebuild the Tay Bridge; at first it was presumed that this would be repair and reconstruction. The Tay Bridge had been designed by the engineer Thomas Bouch, and the proposed Forth Bridge was also designed by him. As enquiries proceeded, Bouch&#x27;s shortcomings in the Tay Bridge became more apparent and his Forth Bridge design was not proceeded with. The planned restoration of the Tay Bridge became the planned construction of a new bridge. It was to be double track, and of course wholly the responsibility of the North British Company. On 18 July 1881 the an act of Parliament for the replacement Tay Bridge received royal assent. On 10 June 1887, the first passenger train passed across the new bridge, and a full public service started from 20 June 1887.

The onward route towards Aberdeen was in progress, and in March 1881 the line between Arbroath and Kinnaber Junction, north of Montrose, was opened. With the replacement Tay Bridge this was to give the NBR more control over its trains to Aberdeen, although they still had to use running powers over the Caledonian Railway north from Kinnaber, and as yet there was no Forth Bridge.


At the time of the fall of the first Tay Bridge, plans for the Forth Bridge were well advanced. Thomas Bouch had been responsible for both designs, and as his culpability in the fall of the Tay Bridge became exposed, the work on the Forth Bridge was suspended. A search for a new design was agreed upon, and the cost of the work was to be shared. The Forth Bridge Railway Company would construct the bridge, and the company would be wholly owned by the North British Railway (30%), the Midland Railway (32.5%), the North Eastern Railway (18.75%) and the Great Northern Railway (18.75%).

The North British Railway was to reapply for powers to build the Glenfarg Line, upgrading the secondary lines through Kinross and connecting from Kinross to Perth, and to build from Inverkeithing to Burntisland to enable Fife coast trains to reach the bridge. New routes were required on the southern shore of the Forth as well, to connect Edinburgh and Glasgow more directly to the bridge.

On 4 March 1890, the Forth Bridge was opened. Until that date the NBR had conveyed passengers and goods into Fife by ferry across the Firth of Forth. The opening of the bridge transformed the railway geography of Fife and the Lothians, but the North British Railway had been slow in forming the approach railways to serve the new crossing, and at first only local trains could use it. Full opening was delayed until 2 June 1890, when the new line from Corstorphine (later called Saughton Junction) to Dalmeny, and the improvements to the lines in Kinross were ready. The NBR now—at last—had a first class line to Perth via Cowdenbeath, Kinross, and the new Glenfarg line; they also had a new line from Inverkeithing through Burntisland.

The approach railways were now complete, but considerable volumes of bad publicity resulted from the inadequate state of Edinburgh Waverley station. Many trains now attached and detached portions and vehicles in the station, and the track layout and platform accommodation was grossly inadequate. The NBR&#x27;s partners in the Forth Bridge Company had, like the NBR itself, invested vast sums of money in the bridge, and they were dismayed to see the critical press coverage now that their investment had at last been completed.

==North Clydeside==
When the North British Railway absorbed the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1865, it acquired the former Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway giving access to the important industrial area of Dumbarton, and the River Leven. The steamer trade on the Clyde was encouraged, and from 1882 the NBR opened a pier at Craigendoran, earlier attempts to build a connecting railway through Helensburgh to the existing pier there having been frustrated.

In 1863, the Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway was opened, encouraging residential travel in the developing suburbs.

The Clyde Commissioners were building what became the Queens Dock at Stobcross, and the NBR were anxious to ensure an efficient railway connection to it; this became the Stobcross Railway which opened in 1874, in fact before the inauguration of the dock.

Further west the line ran parallel to the Clyde but at some distance from it, and in the following years much industry developed on the banks of the Clyde, in many cases displaced from Glasgow itself. The Whiteinch Railway was opened in 1874 to serve a local industrial area; it was worked by the NBR and eventually absorbed in 1891. The Stocbcross Railway formed a departure point for the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway (GY&amp;CR) which ran closer to the Clyde and served the continuing industrial move westward. The GY&amp;CR was absorbed by the NBR in 1897, when the line was extended from Clydebank to join the Helensburgh line at Dalmuir, forming a loop.

Meanwhile, the Glasgow City and District Railway had opened in 1886; also nominally independent but sponsored by the NBR and absorbed by the NBR on opening day, the line ran east–west through the city of Glasgow, with a new low level station at Queens Street. The line transformed suburban services: local branch trains no longer needed to terminate in Queen Street (High Level) station, but simply ran through the city.

For many years, the NBR had a monopoly of the increasing lucrative traffic on North Clydeside, but eventually the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway, nominally independent but sponsored by the Caledonian Railway, was built, opening in stages between 1894 and 1896. The L&amp;DR used the spelling &quot;Dumbartonshire&quot;. Their line reached Dumbarton and this triggered a previous undertaking that the former Dumbarton and Balloch Railway would be made joint between the NBR and the L&amp;DR.

==West Highland Railway==
After long deliberation about the huge area of country in Argyll untouched by railways, the decision was taken to build what became the West Highland Railway, from Craigendoran to Fort William, through largely unpopulated terrain. The constructing company was to be independent, although supported financially by the NBR. The work was authorised in 1889 and it was opened on 7 August 1894. The cost of the construction had been £1.1 million (), a considerable overrun on the estimated cost. The NBR had guaranteed a dividend to the West Highland Railway Company based on a much smaller construction cost, and the commitment was now far beyond what the line was likely to produce in income.

Public policy wished to encourage the fishermen of the West Coast in the area, but Fort William was not considered a suitable fishing port, on account of the long passage required up Loch Linnhe. Financial arrangements seemed to be in place when the Mallaig Extension Bill was passed as the West Highland Railway Act 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. clvi) on 31 July 1894, but the promised Government Guarantee Bill required for the subsidy was not put forward, and for the time being nothing was done. On 7 May 1895 the guarantee was finally forthcoming: a 3% guarantee on £260,000 of capital with a grant of £30,000 to improve the harbour at Mallaig and make it suitable as a fishing harbour. The line opened on 1 April 1901.

The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway opened for traffic on 22 July 1903. Promoted by local people it had obtained its authorising act of Parliament, the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. ccxl). At one time it had looked as if it might extend throughout the Great Glen, but this ambition was cut back. It joined the West Highland Railway at Spean Bridge station, and the line was worked by the Highland Railway from 1903 and the North British Railway from 1907. The population of Fort Augustus was 500.

==Branches around the Campsie Hills==
Early on, in 1848, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had opened a branch line to Lennoxtown from near the present-day . This was extended in 1866–1867 by the Blane Valley Railway to a station near Killearn. In 1877–1879 the Kelvin Valley Railway was opened from to ; the dominant traffic was iron ore and smelted iron from the ironworks at .

North of the Campsie Fells the independent Forth and Clyde Junction Railway opened in 1856 from Balloch to Stirling, passing through largely agricultural terrain. The company leased its line to the NBR in 1866, but stayed in existence, simply receiving and distributing the lease charge, until the grouping of the railways in 1923.

This left a gap between the &quot;Killearn&quot; station and the Forth and Clyde line, and after some years the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway was authorised to close the gap and extend to Aberfoyle. The line opened in 1882, but the company lost money and sold its line to the NBR in 1891. The Blane Valley Railway was absorbed by the NBR at the same time. The original Lennoxtown branch had passed to the NBR with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1865.

On 2 July 1888, the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge railway opened. It was intended mainly for the iron ore and finished iron products of Bairds&#x27; plant at Kilsyth, and the NBR was grudging about the potential of the line for other purposes. It was in effect an extension of the Kelvin Valley Railway at Kilsyth, although the Caledonian Railway exploited it connection at the eastern end, which connected through to Larbert.

==From 1891==
With the huge adverse publicity about the congestion and inadequate accommodation at Waverley station after the opening of the Forth Bridge, the NBR obtained agreement to develop the site, and an act of Parliament was passed on 5 August 1891 to enlarge the station and quadruple the line through Calton Tunnel and westward to Saughton Junction (then named Corstorphine). The work at Waverley progressed slowly, and an act of Parliament for extension of time had to be sought in 1894. It was in fact 1899 before the improvements considered to be required were all in place.

The Midland Railway had abolished second class passenger travel in 1875, and after long deliberation the NBR did the same, on 1 May 1892, except on through trains to England

During July and August 1895, the English partners in the West and East Coast passenger routes engaged in competition to run in the fastest time from London to Aberdeen. This seized the popular imagination and became known as the Race to the North; special lightweight trains were run. The North British Railway was reluctant to join in, for several reasons: it was sceptical whether the cost of the running would pay off in publicity terms; there was continuing bad feeling with the NER over the running powers from Berwick to Edinburgh; and the NBR did not want to offend the Midland Railway, its main partner at Carlisle; the Midland had a more difficult route from London to Carlisle and was not a party to the races.

In November 1896, the North British Railway appealed to the Court of Session about the North Eastern Railway running powers on the line between Berwick and Edinburgh. The NBR had voluntarily agreed to these at the time of the formation of the Border Counties Railway. The Court of Session had ruled against the NBR and the issue was now taken to the House of Lords. The House of Lords referred the matter back to the Railway and Canal Commissioners, and the latter gave an ambiguous judgement, but the ambiguity was sufficient for the NBR to take over the running of all trains north of Berwick from 14 January 1897. This meant that all long-distance passenger trains changed engines at Berwick, and the track layout there was inconvenient for the purpose; the NER owned the track right up to the southern end of the station, and the NER took care to make the engine changing process as difficult as possible.

Taking advantage of the new light railway legislation, the remote community of Lauder gained its own branch line, the Lauder Light Railway, opened on 2 July 1901.

Responding to the demand for residential travel to Edinburgh from the suburbs, the Corstorphine branch was opened by the NBR on 2 February 1902. There had long been a Corstorphine station on the main line; it was now renamed Saughton.

Kincardine was developing as a port and the agricultural district on the Forth east of Alloa was considered to be remote. The NBR opened a branch line from Alloa to Kincardine; it opened in 1893. Although the area was entirely agricultural, the NBR responded to demands for a railway closing the gap, and the Kincardine and Dunfermline Railway, constructed and owned by the NBR, opened in 1906.

==Grouping of the railways==

In the final two years there were lengthy negotiation over war compensation, and negotiation over the share transfer into the LNER. In 1922 the North British had 650 passenger stations, and . There were 1,074 locomotives, and receipts amounted to £2,369,700 (passenger, ), £3,098,293 (mineral, ), and £2,834,848 (merchandise, ).

After the passing of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North British Railway was one of the seven constituents of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), along with the Great Northern Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Central Railway. (The rival Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway were among the constituents of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.)

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 10 August 1880, an express passenger train hauled by a North Eastern Railway locomotive was derailed north of Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland due to defective track. Three people were killed.
*On 3 January 1898, an express passenger train collided with a freight train that was being shunted at , Lothian. One person was killed and 21 were injured.
*On 24 November 1904, a fire at North British Railways Company&#x27;s terminus in Glasgow caused fatal injuries to firefighter William Rae.
*On 12 May 1907, nine-year-old Walter Deas was crossing the line at Steele Road Railway station on the North British railway’s  Waverley Route. Deas was knocked down by an oncoming pilot engine. His injuries were fatal.
*On 24 January 1912, at 14:15, shunter W Wylie was crushed between the train and the platform at Glasgow Queen Street railway station. He succumbed to his injuries two days later.
*On 9 July 1913, just after 9 am at Saughton railway station, carriage cleaners Robert Watt and Williamina Gardiner were struck by the engine of a passing express passenger train, resulting in fatal injuries.
*On 14 April 1914, an express passenger train was in collision with a freight train that was being shunted at , Fife due to a signalman&#x27;s error.
*On 4 January 1917, a light engine overran signals and was in a head-on collision with an express passenger train at Ratho, Lothian. Twelve people were killed and 44 were seriously injured. Irregular operating procedures were a major contributory factor in the accident. These were subsequently stopped.

==Business activities==
The company&#x27;s headquarters were at 23 Waterloo Place, Edinburgh and its works at Cowlairs, Glasgow. Its capital in 1921 was £67 million. Besides its railway, the company also operated Clyde steamers on the River Clyde and Firth of Clyde, serving Arran and points west. The company also acquired a 49% stake in the road haulage firm Mutter Howey.

The North British Hotel at the east end of Princes Street in Edinburgh city centre forms a prominent landmark with its high tower displaying large clocks. It was renamed the Balmoral Hotel in the 1980s, though the old name is still shown in the stonework.

In Glasgow, the former Queen&#x27;s Hotel sited in George Square next to Queen Street Station was renovated in 1905 to become the company&#x27;s North British Station Hotel, with the attic converted into a fourth storey under a mansard roof. Following nationalisation it came under British Transport Hotels until 1984 when British Rail sold the hotel, which by then was called the Copthorne Hotel. It was later renamed the Millennium Hotel.

==Senior officials==
===Chairmen===
===General Managers===

Conacher was a strong-willed manager and many reforms were introduced by him, but in 1899 a scandal arose in the board room of the company in connection with undertakings given by a director, Randolph Wemyss. Wemyss had skilfully manipulated the situation in his own favour, and Conacher felt that he had no alternative but to leave the company.

===Locomotive Superintendents (Chief mechanical engineers)===
The North British Railway preferred the title &quot;Locomotive Superintendent&quot; for the officer responsible to the Board for the production and maintenance of its locomotives, and only the &quot;Locomotive Superintendent&quot; title appears in company records and on the archived records and letterheads of the holders of the position. Only the last incumbent, Walter Chalmers, formally held the title &quot;Chief Mechanical Engineer&quot;, although the two titles are recognised as being different names for the same role within the company.

<text>John Angell James (6 June 1785 – 1 October 1859), was an English Nonconformist clergyman and writer.

==Life==
James was born at Blandford Forum. After seven years&#x27; apprenticeship to a linen-draper in Poole, Dorset, he decided to become a preacher, and in 1802 he went to David Bogue&#x27;s training institution at Gosport in Hampshire.

A year and a half later, on a visit to Birmingham, his preaching was so highly esteemed by the congregation of Carrs Lane Independent chapel that they invited him to exercise his ministry amongst them; he settled there in 1805, and was ordained in May 1806. For several years his success as a preacher was comparatively small; but he became suddenly popular in about 1814, and began to attract large crowds.

At the same time his religious writings, the best known of which are &quot;The Anxious Inquirer&quot; and &quot;An Earnest Ministry&quot;, acquired a wide circulation.

&quot;The Anxious Inquirer&quot; sold over 500,000 copies in his lifetime and was translated into more than a dozen languages. This was the book which D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gave to his wife, Bethan, when she was seeking the Lord. The book was also of great help to Charles Haddon Spurgeon.

In his autobiography Spurgeon wrote: &quot;In an early part of my ministry, while but a lad, I was seized with an intense desire to hear Mr. John Angell James; and, though my finances were somewhat meagre, I performed a pilgrimage to Birmingham solely with that object in view. I heard him deliver a week-evening lecture, in his large vestry, on that precious text, &quot;Ye are complete in Him.&quot; The savour of that very sweet discourse abides with me to this day, and I shall never read the passage without associating therewith the quiet but earnest utterances of that eminent man of God.&quot;

James was a typical Congregational preacher of the early 19th century, massive and elaborate rather than original. His doctrine was a moderate form of Calvinism, as had been that of Edward Williams, one of his predecessors. He published numerous books on practical subjects of the Christian life, including: &quot;The Anxious Inquirer&quot;, &quot;Pastoral Addresses&quot;, &quot;an Earnest Ministry&quot;, &quot;A Help to Domestic Happiness&quot;, &quot;Female Piety&quot;, &quot;The Christian Father&#x27;s Present to His Children&quot;, &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Friend and Guide&quot;, and &quot;The Widow Directed to the Widow&#x27;s God&quot;. Many of these are still available in print and widely used among Conservative and Reformed Christians in the USA (In England he is largely forgotten). He was one of the founders of the Evangelical Alliance and of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Municipal interests appealed strongly to him, and he was also for many years chairman of Spring Hill College, Birmingham.

He was also an ardent abolitionist, and is portrayed in the huge canvass depicting Thomas Clarkson&#x27;s opening address at the world&#x27;s first Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840, in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He was a contemporary of William Wilberforce and Charles Simeon.

John Angell James was keenly involved in all missionary endeavours and a supporter of the London Missionary Society. His name frequently appears in the &quot;Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle&quot;. In 1817 it was James who handed Bibles to John Williams (of Erromanga) and Robert Moffat, in the commissioning service which sent them off to their fields of labour. His fellow student at Bogue&#x27;s Academy, Robert Morrison, gave him a lifelong interest in missionary endeavours in China and he was the main instigator of an effort to send a million New Testaments to China. In the event they raised enough money for two million copies.

In August 1859, at the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of The Metropolitan Tabernacle, Charles Haddon Spurgeon said, &quot;Especially must I mention the name of that honoured father of all the Dissenting churches, the Rev. John Angell James, of Birmingham. There is no name I think just now that ought to be more venerated than his. We frequently exchange notes. I had a sweet letter from that eminent servant of God, in reply to one I had written asking him to come to this meeting. He said, &#x27;I would have done so if I had been well enough, but I am unable to travel. My work is almost done, I cannot serve my Master much longer, but I can still do a little for Him. I preach perhaps once on the Sabbath, and I still continue to do what I can with my pen. What a mercy,&#x27; he adds &#x27;to have been permitted to serve my Master so long.&#x27; I had written to him sometime before expressing my candid opinion concerning him, and my hearty respect; and he told me that I was mistaken in him. I am quite sure that I was not. I know that I could not think too highly of him.&quot; John Angell James died less than two months later, at his home in Birmingham, on 1 October 1859. By special permission of the Home Secretary he was permitted to be interred in a vault beneath his pulpit in Carr&#x27;s Lane Chapel, as had long been his wish. On 15 June 1970, when Carrs Lane Church was being rebuilt, the coffins of John Angell James and his second wife were disinterred and reburied at Witton Cemetery, Birmingham, in an unmarked common grave (Grave No. 147, Section 15). 

John Angell James&#x27;s brother, Thomas (1789-1873), also became a pastor, based in London. His brother James was a deacon at Carrs Lane Chapel. His sister Harriet married Rev. Richard Keynes who became pastor of the Congregational church in Salisbury Street, Blandford Forum, where John Angell James had attended as a child.

==Family==
James married, firstly, to Frances Charlotte Smith (born 1783), on 7 July 1806. Frances, a physician&#x27;s daughter of independent fortune, resided in Hagley Road, Birmingham, where their family would live. They had four children:
* Stillborn (1807) 
* Thomas Smith James (1809-1874) -- see below
* Daughter (1810-1811)
* Sarah Ann James (1814-1882)

Frances died 27 January 1819. Her widower remarried, to Anna Maria Neale on 19 February 1822. Anna was the widow of Benjamin Neale (whom she had married in 1812). She had no children.

==Thomas Smith James==
Thomas Smith James (1809–1874) was a solicitor in Birmingham. He edited his father&#x27;s works (Published in 17 volumes, 1860–64, by Hamilton Adams) in which he also defended his father&#x27;s view of justification against criticisms made by his co-pastor and successor, R.W.Dale, who published The Life and Letters of John Angell James in 1861. (See Volume XVII of The Works of John Angell James, containing the Autobiography of John Angell James with additions by his son).

Thomas Smith James also published &quot;The History of the Litigation and Legislation respecting Presbyterian Chapels and Charities in England and Ireland&quot; &amp;c., 1867. Part of this work was earlier issued as &quot;Lists and Classifications of Presbyterian and Independent Ministers, 1717–31,&quot; &amp;c., 1866, an &#x27;Addendum&#x27; [1868] dealt with the criticisms of John Gordon. The work was inaccurate; it did contain &quot;Dr. Evans&#x27;s List&quot; (1715–1729). His first wife died within weeks of marriage. He married a second time and had two daughters. He died on 3 February 1874.

<text>Jean-Marie Louis Dedecker (born 13 June 1952) is a Belgian politician.

In 1999 and 2003, Dedecker was directly elected to the Belgian Senate for the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). In 2004, he ran for a seat in the Flemish Parliament, and after taking his seat in the Flemish Parliament, he was elected by his colleagues as a community senator as well. He was expelled from the VLD, and eventually sided with the N-VA party for a brief time in November–December 2006. In January 2007, Dedecker presented his own political party— Lijst Dedecker—that participated in the 2007 general election. Against all expectations, Lijst Dedecker got 5 elected in Parliament, and 1 in Senate.

Dedecker became well-known first for his long career as a judo coach, with his judokas winning for Belgium unprecedented number of medals (among them four times Olympian gold), and then for his politics. In 2004, as a pure outsider, he won 38% of the votes for the VLD party leadership against the party establishment. He was expelled from the VLD though in October 2006.

Within the VLD he was one of the members that favours breaking the cordon sanitaire around the Vlaams Belang.

In 2006, (as VLD member) he published a book, &quot;Rechts voor de raap&quot;, which became a national best-seller.

In 2015, he was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think tank Libera!.

Since 2019, he has been the mayor of Middelkerke. In the 2019 Belgian federal election, he was elected to parliament once again as an independent candidate on the N-VA&#x27;s list.

==VLD exit==
The 2006 Belgian municipal elections were lost by the VLD, also in Ostend, where Dedecker was a candidate. In Ostend, they lost out to the Socialist Party (SP.A), for which party president Johan Vande Lanotte was a candidate in the city. In the run-up to the elections, Vande Lanotte and Dedecker clashed severely, with Dedecker claiming that Vande Lanotte, as councilor and socialist party &quot;strong man,&quot; made Ostend the &quot;Palermo of the North Sea.&quot; The local VLD party in Ostend, led by Bart Tommelein, does want to pursue a city coalition with the Socialist though. Dedecker however stated, on election night, that the VLD with this result cannot be part of any coalition. Two days later, the national head of the VLD, Bart Somers, intervened, by stating that Dedecker will be removed from the VLD. Somers stated that in the last few days Dedecker has showed himself to be a &quot;inveterate trouble maker who keeps on creating damaging battles in his own party.&quot; Dedecker responded that &quot;first they use me to attract votes in the local elections, only to put me on the street once the votes have been counted.&quot; Bart Tommelein later on accused Dedecker of being &quot;the &quot;largest&quot; Calimero of Flemish politics.&quot;

It was not unlikely that Dedecker would step over to VLOTT, a party being led by Hugo Coveliers. Coveliers was also a VLD member, but was ejected when he clashed with then party head Karel De Gucht. He openly invited Dedecker to start a VLOTT division in West Flanders. In an opinion article for De Standaard Coveliers wrote: &quot;...I predicted I would not be the last one. There were still some independent minds running around that had to be tamed...Jean-Marie Dedecker goes out the same way: the party leader of the SP.A decides that the VLD has to bring a sacrifice, which the VLD executive eagerly fulfills... They thereby relinquish themselves of a tough contender. These corruptible politicians would simply not allow any criticism... There is no one left to oppose them now Dedecker is liquidated... With his liquidation, the VLD merges left, soon to turn left, to the left side of society. Far away from the original liberal voters and principles.&quot; Coveliers claims he was ejected from the VLD on command of (then) SP.A leader Steve Stevaert. Some believe the same thing happened to Dedecker, on command of Socialist Party leader Johan Vande Lanotte.

==N-VA entry and exit==
After being expelled from the VLD Dedecker looked into starting a new liberal party, which might have seen the involvement of Hugo Coveliers of VLOTT, and law professor Boudewijn Bouckaert. He made it clear that he would not join the Vlaams Belang, the largest right wing party of Flanders. In November 2006, Dedecker founded the right-liberal thinkthank &quot;Cassandra&quot;. On 30 November 2006 it was announced that Dedecker joined the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) on behalf of the N-VA party board, because it proved difficult in Belgium to meet the electoral threshold of 5% with a new party.

The Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V), with whom the N-VA had an electoral cartel agreement, stated they didn&#x27;t want to be in league with Dedecker and broke off the association. On 9 December 2006, the N-VA party congress decided they preferred the cartel with CD&amp;V over Dedecker; afterwards Dedecker resigned from the party he joined only ten days earlier.

==Belgian cycling doping affair==
In September 2006, Dedecker told the press that he had the names of three Belgian cyclists, who went to Italy for illegal doping treatments. In January 2007, Belgian cyclist Johan Museeuw admitted that he took stimulants during the last years of his cycling career, and that he confided this earlier to Dedecker. The newspaper &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; claimed on the basis of various accounts of people close to Quick Step-Innergetic manager Patrick Lefevere, that Lefevere has pushed cyclists to use illegal stimulants. Lefevere is now suing Dedecker for €75,000 over his earlier allegations about doping use among Belgian cyclists.

The information Dedecker gave in September 2006 led to house searches throughout Belgium in June 2007 of persons related to cycling. The judiciary found various illegal substances during the search.

==LDD==
On 3 January 2007, Dedecker announced that he would set up a new political party. On 4 January 2007, Dedecker explained his plans by stating that he wanted to be the Flemish party political equivalent of Geert Wilders and Pim Fortuyn. He called his project a healthy right-wing political formation.

On 6 January, a preparatory meeting was held in Ostend with some sympathizers, including Boudewijn Bouckaert (ex-VLD), former mayor of Ledegem Paul Vanhie, Walter Govaert, former alderman of Keerbergen John Lambrechts (also ex-VLD) and Saïd Bouharrak, a consultant of Belgian- Moroccan descent. Dedecker officially presented his new party on 19 January 2007. In the 2007 Belgian federal election, he was elected to the House of Representatives for his new party. In October 2009 he published the book &quot;Headscarf or Blindfold&quot; in which he criticized mass migration and advance of Islam in Europe. Following the 2010 Belgian federal election, Dedecker resigned as leader of the LDD and stepped down from national politics.

==Return to politics==
On 14 October 2018, Dedecker was elected as mayor of Middelkerke. In the 2019 Belgian federal election, he stood for the West Flanders constituency as an independent candidate affiliated to the N-VA&#x27;s list. He was elected with 40,781 preferential votes and sat as an independent in the Chamber of Representatives. In October 2020, Dedecker stated in an interview that he will resign from parliament as he wanted to give priority to his mayorship.

<doc id="1165102" wikidata="Q2088790" url="?curid=1165102" title="Shrivenham">
<text>Shrivenham is a village and civil parish in the Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, England, about south-west of Faringdon. The village is close to the county boundary with Wiltshire and about east-northeast of Swindon. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,347. The parish is within the historic boundaries of Berkshire; the 1974 boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire for administrative purposes.

==History==
There has been human settlement at Shrivenham from at least 400 BC. The remains of a Roman villa have been uncovered nearby. Shrivenham was part of Shrivenham Hundred which included Ashbury, Buscot, Coleshill, Compton Beauchamp, Eaton Hastings, Longcot, Shrivenham, and Uffington.

Shrivenham has numerous thatched cottages, stone walls, a historic pump and a parish church that is unusual for having been rebuilt in the 17th century. The village has three historic public houses: the Barrington Arms, The Crown and the Prince of Wales.

The main country estate in Shrivenham surrounded Beckett Hall. In the 17th century it was the home of Henry Marten, the regicide. Later the Barrington family owned the estate and lived at Beckett Hall. The 6th Viscount Barrington had the present house built in 1830–1831; it is a Grade II listed building.

Charlotte, the second wife of the 9th Viscount Barrington, endowed the memorial hall in the village which was opened in 1925 by Princess Beatrice, daughter of Queen Victoria; in Cotswold Arts and Crafts style, the hall has caretaker&#x27;s quarters attached. The hall and surrounding playing fields, known as Viscountess Barrington&#x27;s Memorial Hall &amp; Recreation Ground, are on Highworth Road.

==Churches==
Shrivenham had a parish church by 1117, when Henry I granted its advowson to the Augustinian Cirencester Abbey upon the latter&#x27;s foundation. Little survives from the church of that time save for part of the west wall of the nave, which is late 12th century, and the font which is carved from Purbeck Marble. By the 15th century the parish church was cruciform, with a central Perpendicular Gothic belltower that was built in about 1400. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew is the result of a comprehensive and unusual rebuilding in 1638, funded largely by the Earl of Craven. 

The end walls of the nave, chancel and two transepts were extended to form a rectangle with a nave of three bays with round arches on Tuscan columns with excessive entasis; a chancel of two bays; and north and south aisles running the full length of the nave, tower and chancel. The nave, chancel and aisles share one continuous roof. The central bell tower was retained in what otherwise was an almost completely new early 17th century church. A Jacobean wooden pulpit and tester and almost continuous panelling around the walls completed the interior. The building remains largely as it was completed in 1638, apart from the addition of a neoclassical west porch in the middle of the 18th century.

Inside St Andrew&#x27;s are numerous monuments. The oldest is a stone recumbent effigy in the south aisle, apparently of a 14th-century woman. Many of the monuments from later centuries commemorate notable residents of Beckett Hall, including John Wildman (c. 1621– 1693), Rothesia Ann Barrington (died 1745; monument sculpted by Thomas Paty), John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington (1678–1734), William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington (1717–1793; monument designed by James Wyatt and sculpted by Richard Westmacott) and Rear Admiral Samuel Barrington (1729–1800; monument sculpted by John Flaxman). The tower has a ring of ten bells. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the six largest bells, including the tenor, in 1908. Gillett &amp; Johnston of Croydon cast the third and fourth bells in 1948. These were a gift from a US Army civil affairs unit that trained in Shrivenham before the Normandy invasion. The ring was increased from eight to ten bells in 2003 when the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present treble and second bells. A Primitive Methodist chapel was established in the village in 1872. It is now Shrivenham Methodist Church.

==Economic history==
The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal – from Semington on the Kennet and Avon Canal to Abingdon on the River Thames – was built between 1796 and 1810. In 1805 it reached Shrivenham where a wharf was built. Coal delivered via Semington to Shrivenham peaked at 601 tons in 1840, when the Great Western Railway was built through the area and opened Shrivenham station. Coal deliveries by canal fluctuated through the 1840s and then collapsed from 272 tons in 1850 to only 28 tons in 1852 and none for most years thereafter. Other canal freight also declined, and between 1893 and 1896 just 48 tons were shipped between Shrivenham and Wantage. In 1894–95 Ainsworth, a local canal carrier, handled 23 tons of freight at Shrivenham. By then the canal was increasingly in disrepair; in 1901 the collapse of the Stanley Aqueduct effectively ended the little remaining traffic, and in 1914 an Act of Parliament formalised the abandonment of the canal.

The railway station continued to serve the parish until British Railways closed it in 1964. Pennyhooks Farm Trust, begun at Pennyhooks Farm in 2001, provides development opportunities for people on the autism spectrum.

== Military sites ==
Shrivenham has been connected with military education and training since 1936, when the Beckett estate was sold to the War Office following the death of Charlotte Barrington the previous year. 

A training establishment was built north-east of Beckett Hall. At the outbreak of war in 1939 the 133rd Officer Cadet Training Unit was established here, one of six OCTUs created to meet the increased demand. Shrivenham specialised in anti-aircraft artillery, and after an improvised start, the course length was standardised at six months. At some point the main buildings gained names such as Marlborough Hall and Wellington Hall.

=== GI American University ===
At the end of World War II in Europe, the US Army&#x27;s Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women. From 1945 to 1946, Shrivenham American University was housed at the Beckett Hall site. This, and two other campuses in Europe, was set up to provide a transition between army life and subsequent attendance at a university in the USA, and therefore students attended for just one term.

=== Since 1946 ===
The Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) moved into the establishment in 1946, having been dispersed across three sites during the war. In 2015 the college was absorbed into the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom. The academy provides higher education for personnel in the British Armed Forces, Civil Service, other government departments and service personnel from other nations. The academy is headquartered at Shrivenham and delivers education and training in a number of sites. The majority of training is postgraduate with many courses being accredited for the award of civilian qualifications. The Conflict Studies Research Centre (CSRC) is just over the parish boundary in Watchfield.

Joint Services Command and Staff College (JSCSC) is a military academic establishment providing training and education to experienced officers of the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, Ministry of Defence Civil Service, and serving officers of other states. JSCSC combined the single service provision of the British Armed Forces: Royal Naval College, Greenwich, Staff College, Camberley, RAF Staff College, Bracknell and the Joint Service Defence College, Greenwich. Initially formed at Bracknell in 1997, the college moved to a purpose-built facility in the grounds of the Defence Academy in 2000.

Since 2020, Beckett House has been the home of the tri-service Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre. A new building for the Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Museum opened there in 2022.

Defence Futures (formerly the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre), the MOD&#x27;s independent think tank, is also in the area.

Between 2005 and 2010, the Conflict Studies Research Centre (CSRC) was part of the UK Defence Academy. It specialised in potential causes of conflict in a wide area ranging from the Baltic to Central Asia. This geographical focus was inherited from the centre&#x27;s original incarnation as the Soviet Studies Research Centre (SSRC) in 1972, at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, examining the Soviet military threat. Renamed in the 1990s, the body later examined wider issues including foreign policy, energy security and demographic change.

==In literature==
In &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, the main character Tom Brown mentions Shrivenham railway station (now closed):&quot;Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as far as Swindon. Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been aware, soon after leaving the Didcot station, of a fine range of chalk hills running parallel with the railway on the left-hand side as you go down, and distant some two or three miles, more or less, from the line. The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill, which you come in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station. If you love English scenery, and have a few hours to spare, you can&#x27;t do better, the next time you pass, than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham station, and make your way to that highest point.&quot;

==Sport and leisure==
The local football team is Shrivenham F.C. The Vale of White Horse Gliding Centre flies from Sandhill Farm, just north of the village.

An 18-hole golf course is just outside the village.

<doc id="1165107" wikidata="Q86932" url="?curid=1165107" title="Ladislaus III of Hungary">
<text>Ladislaus III (, , ; 12007 May 1205) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1204 and 1205. He was the only child of King Emeric. Ladislaus was crowned king upon the orders of his ill father, who wanted to secure his infant son&#x27;s succession. The dying king made his brother, Andrew, regent for the period of Ladislaus&#x27;s minority. However, Duke Andrew ignored the child&#x27;s interests. As a result, Ladislaus&#x27;s mother, Constance of Aragon, fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her. Ladislaus died unexpectedly in Vienna.

==Infancy (c. 1200–1204)==
Ladislaus was the only known child of King Emeric and his wife, Constance of Aragon. The exact date of Ladislaus&#x27;s birth is unknown, but it is likely that he was born around 1200, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk. After falling seriously ill, King Emeric ordered Ladislaus&#x27;s coronation in an attempt to secure a smooth succession for his infant son. John, Archbishop of Kalocsa, crowned Ladislaus on 26 August 1204. Emeric reconciled with his defiant younger brother, Andrew, whom he had imprisoned. He set Andrew free, and made him regent for the duration of Ladislaus&#x27;s minority.

==Reign (1204–1205)==

On 30 November 1204, King Emeric died, and Ladislaus succeeded him. Pope Innocent III sent a letter to Duke Andrew, warning him to respect the child king&#x27;s interests. However, refusing to heed Innocent&#x27;s warning, Andrew seized the money that Emeric had deposited in the Pilis Abbey for Ladislaus. Considering her son&#x27;s position to be insecure, Constance fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her.

Although Duke Andrew made every effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric&#x27;s and Duke Andrew&#x27;s cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, although Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.

<doc id="1165108" wikidata="Q3069804" url="?curid=1165108" title="Thorold Rogers">
<text>James Edwin Thorold Rogers (23 March 1823 – 14 October 1890), known as Thorold Rogers, was an English economist, historian and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1886. He deployed historical and statistical methods to analyse some of the key economic and social questions in Victorian England. As an advocate of free trade and social justice, he distinguished himself from some others within the English Historical School.

==Background and formative years==
Rogers was born at West Meon, Hampshire, the son of George Vining Rogers and his wife Mary Ann Blyth, daughter of John Blyth. He was educated at King&#x27;s College London and Magdalen Hall, Oxford. After taking a first-class degree in 1846, he received his MA in 1849 from Magdalen and was ordained. A High Church man, he was curate of St. Paul&#x27;s in Oxford, and acted voluntarily as assistant curate at Headington from 1854 to 1858, until his views changed and he turned to politics. Rogers was instrumental in obtaining the Clerical Disabilities Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 91), of which he was the first beneficiary, becoming the first man legally to withdraw from his clerical vows in 1870.

For some time the classics were the chief field of his activity. He devoted himself to classical and philosophical tuition in Oxford with success, and his publications included an edition of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; (in 1865).

==Anecdotes==

The Victorian journalist George W. E. Russell (1853–1919) relates an exchange between Rogers and Benjamin Jowett (&quot;Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography&quot;, 1914, 111–2) :

&#x27;Another of our Professors – J. E. Thorold Rogers – though perhaps scarcely a celebrity, was well known outside Oxford, partly because he was the first person to relinquish the clerical character under the Act of 1870, partly because of his really learned labours in history and economics, and partly because of his Rabelaisian humour. He was fond of writing sarcastic epigrams, and of reciting them to his friends, and this habit produced a characteristic retort from Jowett. Rogers had only an imperfect sympathy with the historians of the new school, and thus derided the mutual admiration of Green and Freeman —

&quot;Where, ladling butter from a large tureen,
See blustering Freeman butter blundering Green.&quot;

To which Jowett replied, in his quavering treble, &quot;That&#x27;s a false antithesis, Rogers. It&#x27;s quite possible to bluster and blunder, too!&quot;&#x27;

==Political economy==
Simultaneously with these occupations he had been studying economics. He became the first Tooke Professor of Statistics and Economic Science at King&#x27;s College London, serving in this role from 1859 until his death. During this time he also held the Drummond professorship of political economy at All Souls College, Oxford from 1862 until 1867, when Bonamy Price was elected in his stead. In this he became a friend and follower of Richard Cobden, an advocate for free trade, non-intervention in Europe and an end to imperial expansion, whom he met during his first tenure as Drummond professor. Rogers said of Cobden, &quot;he knew that ... political economy ... was, or ought to be, eminently inductive, and that an economist without facts is like an engineer without materials or tools.&quot; Rogers had a wealth of facts at his disposal: his most influential works were the 6-volume &quot;History of Agriculture and Prices in England from 1259 to 1795&quot; and &quot;Six Centuries of Work and Wages&quot;; he spent 20 years collecting facts for the latter work.

He served as President of the first day of the 1875 Co-operative Congress. He was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Southwark in 1880 and held the seat until it was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. At the 1885 general election he was elected MP for Bermondsey and held the seat until 1886. Rogers also lectured in political economy at Worcester College, Oxford in 1883 and was re-elected Drummond professor in 1888.

==Family==
Rogers married Ann Susannah Charlotte Reynolds, daughter of Henry Revell Reynolds, Treasury Solicitor, in December 1854. They had a daughter, Annie Mary Anne Henley Rogers, who was an active supporter of the Liberal party, higher education for women and women&#x27;s suffrage. Between December 1850 and January 1853 (her death), he had been married to Anna, only daughter of William Peskett, surgeon, of Petersfield, Hampshire.

<text>Dave&#x27;s Gourmet is a company notable for creating and introducing Dave&#x27;s Insanity Sauce, which formerly held the title of &quot;world&#x27;s hottest sauce.&quot; The sauce is widely distributed through gourmet hot sauce boutiques and online hot-sauce sites.

==History==

The original Dave&#x27;s Insanity Sauce premiered around 1993 and was one of the first sauces to be made directly from capsaicin extract, allowing it to be hotter than the hottest habanero-pepper sauces of the day. It has been rated at 180,000 Scoville units, compared with 2,500 for Tabasco sauce. Part of the intrigue behind the sauce name (Insanity) was founder Dave Hirschkop’s wearing of a straitjacket at events promoting his products.

==Varieties==

The following varieties of Dave&#x27;s Gourmet sauces are currently available:

===Standard sauces===

* Cool Cayenne Sauce
* Ginger Peach Hot Sauce
* Hurtin&#x27; Jalapeño Sauce
* Hurtin&#x27; Habanero Sauce
* Jammin&#x27; Jerk Sauce
* Roasted Garlic Hot Sauce
* Roasted Red Pepper &amp; Chipotle Hot Sauce

<text>Captain Kidder Randolph Breese USN (14 April 1831 – 13 September 1881) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Breese was appointed a U.S. Navy midshipman in November 1846 and served in the sloop of war during the remainder of the war with Mexico. Sea duty continued until October 1851, when he was assigned to the Naval Academy to prepare for examination. Warranted a passed midshipman in June 1852, Breese took part in Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s expedition to Japan for the next three years.

In mid-1855, while serving with the United States Coast Survey, he was promoted to the ranks of master and lieutenant. He served in the sloop of war in 1858 and 1859, during the Paraguay Expedition, and off Panama. Lieutenant Breese&#x27;s next duties were as an officer of the sloop of war , off Africa, in 1860, and of the steamer from mid-1860 until late 1861.

==Civil War service==
While he was serving on the &quot;San Jacinto&quot;, the Civil War began. He was present when she stopped the British steamship and removed two Confederate agents, an incident that provoked a brief crisis in U.S. relations with Great Britain, known as the Trent Affair.

From late 1861 Breese commanded part of the flotilla of mortar schooners that helped capture New Orleans in April 1862.

Promoted to lieutenant commander in mid-1862, he served with Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter on the Mississippi River and off the United States East Coast for most of the rest of the conflict, distinguishing himself during the Siege of Vicksburg, commanding 2,000 sailors and Marines in the successful land assault on Fort Fisher, and as Porter&#x27;s Fleet Captain.

==Post-war service==
After the war, Breese held various commands both afloat and ashore. Beginning in September 1865, Breese spent a year as Assistant to the Naval Academy&#x27;s Superintendent, achieving the rank of commander while in that post.

During the later 1860s and into 1870 he served on Navy boards and had ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. In 1870–1872 he commanded the steam sloop in European waters.

He was Inspector of Ordnance at New Orleans for several months in 1872–1873, followed by two years as Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, and as Inspector of Hydrography. Breese was promoted to captain in 1874.

From mid-1875 until early 1879 he commanded the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, and had special ordnance duty. He was Commanding Officer of the steam sloop , the Pacific Squadron flagship, in 1879 and 1880 and, in 1881, was a member of the Board of Harbor Commissioners.

Breese died at Newport, Rhode Island, on 13 September 1881. He is buried in the Island Cemetery in Newport.

==Legacy==
The United States Navy has honored Breese&#x27;s memory in several ways. The destroyer was named for him, as was a street at the Washington Navy Yard.

<doc id="1165118" wikidata="Q333370" url="?curid=1165118" title="Edward Horsman">
<text>Edward Horsman PC, PC (Ire) (8 February 1807 – 30 November 1876), was a British politician.

==Background and education==
Horsman was the son of William Horsman, a well-to-do gentleman of Stirling, Scotland, who died 22 March 1845, aged 86. His mother was Jane, third daughter of Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet, and sister of the seventh and eighth Earls of Stair; she died in 1833. He entered Rugby School at Midsummer 1819, and afterwards proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree. While at Cambridge he took part in three first-class cricket matches. He was admitted an advocate of the Scottish bar in 1832, but did not long continue to practise his profession.

==Political career==

As a moderate liberal he unsuccessfully contested Cockermouth in 1835, but was successful at the following election on 15 February 1836, and continued to represent the constituency till 1 July 1852. Defeated at the general election of that date, he was returned unopposed on 28 June 1853 for Stroud, and sat for that town till 11 November 1868. At the 1868 general election he stood unsuccessfully in Falkirk Burghs. From 11 May 1869 to his death he was member for Liskeard, but he had then so far separated himself from the Liberal Party that he was opposed on both occasions by more advanced members of his own partyin 1869 by Sir F. Lycett, and in 1874 by Leonard Courtney.

Early in his political career (January 1840) Horsman, when addressing his constituents at Cockermouth, denounced James Bradshaw, M.P. for Canterbury, for speaking ill of the queen, and for secretly sympathising with the chartists. A bitter correspondence was followed by a duel at Wormwood Scrubbs, which was without serious results. Finally Bradshaw apologised. Horsman was from September to August 1841 a junior Lord of the Treasury in Lord Melbourne&#x27;s administration. He criticised severely, and at times with personal bitterness, the ecclesiastical policy of Lord John Russell&#x27;s ministry of 1847, as being far too favourable to the bishops. A vote of censure on the ecclesiastical commissioners was moved by him and rejected 14 December 1847. On 26 April 1850, in the discussion on the Ecclesiastical Commission Bill, Horsman smartly attacked the bishops, and roused Goulburn to denounce him as &quot;a disappointed man&quot; foiled of his hopes of office. In March 1855, when Lord Palmerston became prime minister and the Peelites withdrew from the cabinet, Horsman was made Chief Secretary for Ireland, and was sworn a member of both the British and Irish Privy Councils. He resigned the chief secretaryship after the general election in April 1857, and thenceforth assumed a more independent position in the House of Commons. With Robert Lowe, afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke, he resisted the Reform Bill brought in by William Ewart Gladstone in March 1866. John Bright, speaking on the second reading (13 March 1866), ascribed Mr. Lowe&#x27;s hostility to Horsman&#x27;s influence, and depicted Horsman retiring &#x27;into what may be called his political cave of Adullam, to which he invited every one who was in distress, and every one who was discontented.&#x27; According to Bright Horsman&#x27;s party, to which Bright&#x27;s sobriquet of the &quot;cave&quot; has since adhered, consisted only of himself and Mr. Lowe, but thirty-three liberal members voted against the second reading of the bill upon which the ministry was afterwards defeated in committee (18 June). Horsman maintained his independent attitude to the last. He best served the public by exposing jobs and other weak points in the ecclesiastical system.

In 1841, while he was a junior lord of the treasury, he gained notoriety for attacking Lord John Russell&#x27;s ecclesiastical policy in 1847 and subsequent years. In 1855, under Lord Palmerston, he was made Chief Secretary for Ireland, but resigned in 1857. He gradually took up a position as an independent Liberal, and was well known for his attacks on the Church, and his exposures of various &quot;jobs&quot;. His name became principally connected with his influence over Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke in 1866 at the time of Gladstone&#x27;s Reform Bill, to which he and Lowe were hostile; and it was in describing the Lowe-Horsman combination that John Bright spoke of the &quot;Cave of Adullam&quot;. In the 1867 debate on extending the franchise, he said in the House of Commons: &quot;There is an irreconciliable enmity between democracy and freedom&quot;.

==Family==
Horsman married Charlotte Louisa, only daughter of John Charles Ramsden, MP, on 18 November 1841. He died at Biarritz, France, on 30 November 1876, aged 68, and was buried there on 2 December.

==Publications==
# &quot;Speech on the Bishopric of Manchester Bill&quot;, 1847, two editions.
# &quot;Five Speeches on Ecclesiastical Affairs delivered in the House of Commons, 1847, 1848, and 1849&quot;.
# &quot;Speech on the Present State of Parties and Public Questions&quot;, 1861.

His views and assertions were criticised in &quot;Mr. Horsman&#x27;s Statement respecting the Horfield Manor Lease&quot;, by J. H. Monk, bishop of Gloucester, 1852; in &quot;Mr. Horsman&#x27;s Motion in the House of Commons [on the institution of Bennett to vicarage of Frome], tested by Extracts from &#x27;Letters to my Children&#x27;&quot;, by the Rev. W. J. E. Bennett, 1852 (HANSARD, 20 April 1852, pp. 895–916); and in &quot;An Usurious Rate of Discount limits and prevents the Working Classes from obtaining Employment. Being a reply to Mr. Horsman&quot;, by R. Wason, 1866.

<doc id="1165125" wikidata="Q37849" url="?curid=1165125" title="Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park">
<text>Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park is a BC Park situated on the Trans-Canada Highway just east of Rosedale, British Columbia, Canada, within of the City of Chilliwack. The community of Bridal Falls is located adjacent to the falls and park, as well as the interchange between the Trans-Canada and BC Highway 9, offering a variety of highway-based tourism services. Access to the falls requires a short hike from the parking lot and well-groomed trails, taking most groups 15-25 minutes.

This Park is named after the waterfall that it encompasses, Bridal Veil Falls, which is the 38th highest waterfall in British Columbia. However, it is commonly misstated as the 4th tallest in Canada. The falls drop 122 metres (400 feet) over a wide rock face, creating a &quot;veil-like&quot; effect. Unfortunately, only the bottom 200–250 feet can clearly be viewed from the base due to the viewing-points&#x27; location directly at the base. It is located at the south end of the land set aside as provincial Park. Their source is Mount Archibald, and they flow into Bridal Creek, which then travels to Cheam Lake Wetlands Regional Park and finally to the Fraser River.

During drier summer months, the volume of the water decreases significantly, reducing the visual impact of the waterfall.

Bridal Veil Falls tend to freeze during cold winters, creating a wall of ice that is often unstable. Consequently, the base of the falls becomes an extremely hazardous area, leading to the closure of the park during the winter season. While the falls are frozen solid, they become a sought-after destination for ice climb. However, climbers recognize the difficulty of climbing in these conditions and the infrequency of stable climbing conditions. 
Bridal Veil Falls was named in the 19th century by the village of Popkum. In the early 20th century, the village used the waterfall with a hydro-electric generator to power the chalet and heated swimming pool in the village. Only the concrete foundation of the generator can be found today.

<doc id="1165127" wikidata="Q1264153" url="?curid=1165127" title="Hartford Dark Blues">
<text>The Hartfords (more commonly called the Hartford Dark Blues because of their uniform color) were a 19th-century baseball team. The team was based in Hartford, Connecticut.

==History==
In 1874, baseball in Hartford, CT was being played in a fever pitch. As talk of forming a national professional league was going on, Morgan Bulkeley, Gershon Hubbell and Middletown native Ben Douglas Jr. leased land from Elizabeth Colt to build a base ball field and stadium with a covered grandstand, and set about forming a team, The Hartfords. Located on the corner of Wyllys and Hendrixsen Streets next to the Church of the Good Shepherd, the Hartford Ball Club Grounds was the finest in the country and saw the team come in second to Chicago in the National League&#x27;s first professional year, 1876. That team that was led by Captain Bob Ferguson and was rounded out by pitchers Candy Cummings (purported inventor of the curve ball), Tommy Bond (the only pitcher in baseball history to have three 40-game winning years in a row), Tom Carey, Everett Mills, Bill Harbridge, Tom York, Dick Higham, Jack Burdock, Jack Remsen and Doug Allison.

The Hartford Dark Blues were a member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in 1874 and 1875 and the National League in 1876 and 1877. In 1877 the team played in Brooklyn, New York as the Brooklyn Hartfords.

Playing at the Hartford Ball Club Grounds, in 1876 they joined the National League as a charter member. The team&#x27;s owner, Morgan G. Bulkeley, was also the first president of the National League. Managed by their third baseman, Bob Ferguson, the Dark Blues went on to finish third in 1876 with a record of 47–21. The team&#x27;s strong suit was pitching, with both Tommy Bond and future Hall of Famer Candy Cummings finishing with an earned run average under 2.00. The pitching staff recorded the most complete games (69) and allowed the lowest number of home runs throughout the 70-game 1876 campaign (the Philadelphia Athletics also accomplished this feat that season). The team&#x27;s best hitter was right fielder Dick Higham, who led the team in most offensive categories.

The team left Hartford and moved to Brooklyn, New York for the 1877 season to become the Brooklyn Hartfords. Managed again by Ferguson, the team finished in third again, with a record of 31–27. With Bond, Cummings and Higham all having left the team, the team&#x27;s best player this year was undoubtedly right fielder John Cassidy, who batted .378 and also led the team in many other categories.

The team disbanded after the 1877 season and was replaced in the league with the Providence Grays. 

Author Mark Twain was a fan of the team.

<text>The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&amp;GNJR) was a railway network in England, in the area connecting southern Lincolnshire, the Isle of Ely and north Norfolk. It developed from several local independent concerns and was incorporated in 1893. It was jointly owned by the Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railway, and those companies had long sponsored and operated the predecessor companies.

The area directly served was agricultural and sparsely populated, but seaside holidays had developed and the M&amp;GNJR ran many long-distance express trains to and from the territory of the parent companies, as well as summer local trains for holidaymakers. It had the longest mileage of any joint railway in the United Kingdom.

In the grouping of 1923, the two joint owners of the M&amp;GNJR were absorbed into two separate companies (the Midland into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Great Northern into the London and North Eastern Railway). The M&amp;GNJR maintained a distinct identity which only formally ended with nationalisation in 1948. After 1945 the profitability of the network declined steeply, worsened by the seasonality of the business. It was duplicated by other lines and the decision was taken to close it. Most of the network closed in 1959, although some limited sections continued in use. Only a short section near Sheringham is in commercial use today, but the North Norfolk Railway is active as a heritage line.

==First railways==
The area eventually served by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, taken as south Lincolnshire and north Norfolk, was late to be supplied with railway connections due to being sparsely-populated fenland. The Great Northern Railway (GNR), running north through Huntingdon, Peterborough and on to Grantham, so forming the western edge of the area, was not authorised until 1846 and not opened until 1848 between Peterborough and Lincoln. The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), authorised in 1836, aspired to reach Norwich and Yarmouth, but ran out of money and stopped short.

In frustration local people obtained Parliamentary authority for the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway in 1842. Running via Reedham it opened to the public on 1 May 1844. In 1845 railway mania was underway, and a myriad of railway schemes was put before Parliament. Many of these foundered there, or were authorised but failed to generate investors&#x27; commitment.

By 1850 the ECR had recovered from its financial difficulties of 1836 and had connected practically every town of importance in East Anglia into its system. For some years the ECR had successfully resisted the promotion of independent railways in its area but this could not continue indefinitely, and some local lines began to obtain authorisation.

The East Anglian Railway company was an amalgamation of three earlier companies, the Lynn and Dereham Railway, the Lynn and Ely Railway and the Ely and Huntingdon Railway. The company became bankrupt early in 1851 and the GNR, operating the East Coast Main Line at Peterborough, leased the line. Using running powers between its line at Peterborough and March over the ECR, it intended to connect to King&#x27;s Lynn via the Wisbech line of the East Anglian Railway. However the powers acquired from Parliament did not include a short section between the two companies&#x27; stations at Wisbech, and the scheme foundered. The GNR sold the line on to the ECR in 1852.

The financial performance of the ECR declined over the years and in 1862 it was absorbed into the new Great Eastern Railway (GER).

==Constituents of the M&amp;GNJR==

The ultimate formation of the M&amp;GNJR resulted from the fusion of numerous local schemes, though they did not at first aspire to form a connected railway.

===Norwich and Spalding Railway===
On 4 August 1853 the Norwich and Spalding Railway obtained its Act for a line from Spalding to Sutton Bridge, and from there to Wisbech. Notwithstanding the company&#x27;s title, reaching Norwich was an (unfulfilled) aspiration for later rather than an immediate intention. The Act stipulated that the other parts of the proposed Norwich and Spalding system could not be opened unless genuine progress was being made with the Wisbech connection.

In fact at this time the money market was particularly difficult, partly because of the Crimean War, and the company was unable to attract enough investment. It only managed to build from Spalding to Holbeach, , opening to Holbeach for goods on 9 August 1858 and for passengers on 15 November 1858. The Wisbech stipulation appears to have been overlooked for the time being.

The line connected with the Great Northern Railway at Spalding and the GNR agreed to work the line for three years. There were four trains daily except Sundays, with one extra on Tuesdays.
The company obtained a further authorising Act to extend from Holbeach to Sutton Bridge, as the earlier powers had expired. Wisbech was omitted this time, but the Act stipulated that no dividend might be declared unless the company proceeded with the promotion of the Wisbech line in Parliament. This was attempted in 1860 but rejected in Parliament, and again in 1862 and 1863. The GNR agreed to extend the working arrangement to ten years from 1 November 1861 for 50% of receipts and to carry out some permanent way improvements on the original section. The Sutton Bridge station was on the site of the later goods station, west of the River Nene. The extension to Holbeach was completed and opened on 1 July 1862.

===Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge===
The line connecting Wisbech to Sutton Bridge was considered important because Sutton Bridge was an important inland port further downstream on the River Nene than Wisbech port. Wisbech would have been reached by a southward branch of the Norwich and Spalding Railway, but now an alternative means of making the connection was brought forward. On 28 July 1863 the authorising Act for the Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway was passed. Capital was to be £180,000.
In 1871 Richard Young a local shipowner (and later director of the Great Eastern Railway) was chairman of the company.
The Eastern Counties Railway had just been transformed into the Great Eastern Railway, and powers were to be sought by the PW&amp;SBR to connect to the GER line at Wisbech. The Norwich and Spalding Railway was given running powers between Sutton Bridge and Wisbech. It was the Midland Railway, not the GNR, that secured the contract for operating the new railway for 50% of receipts.

===Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway===
The next section of the future M&amp;GNJR to be built was the Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway, which was authorised on 6 August 1861 with capital of £100,000. It was to connect with the Eastern Counties Railway (soon to be GER) at South Lynn, near the major port of King&#x27;s Lynn. The authorisation obliged the company to construct a new rail and road bridge at Sutton Bridge, but this was modified by an Act in 1863 which permitted the railway to purchase the existing road swing bridge, built in 1850, and adapt it for railway use as well. The line was opened for goods traffic throughout in November 1864 from a junction some distance south of King&#x27;s Lynn station. Passenger trains provided by the GNR began on 1 March 1866.

===Spalding and Bourn Railway===
On 29 July 1862 the Spalding and Bourn Railway was authorised, also with capital of £100,000. This line was to make an end-on junction at Bourne with an offshoot of the GNR, the Bourne and Essendine Railway. The line was opened on 1 August 1866. It ran through practically unpopulated terrain. The GNR worked the line.

===PW&amp;SBR extending to Wisbech===
The Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway now in 1864 got authorisation to make a connecting line at Wisbech to the GER line, and to the harbour. The connection to the GER was in fact not made. On 1 August 1866 its main line opened for traffic. At Peterborough it started from the Midland Railway lines, on the west side of the GNR main line, and crossed both the Midland and GNR track by a bridge. The line was in length, to a junction at Sutton Bridge. The Midland Railway worked the trains, working to and from the GER station at Peterborough and calling at the GNR station en route.

==Rivalry between the GNR and the GER==
The Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed on 7 August 1862, from the Eastern Counties Railway and other concerns. The GER made it clear, not least by bitter parliamentary struggles, to get authorisation for its own line or for running powers to get to Doncaster. Considerable quantities of coal were being brought south from the South Yorkshire Coalfield by the GNR, and the GER sought to take a share of the traffic. Fearing that this might happen, suddenly giving the GER a monopoly of the coal traffic to East Anglia, the GNR started to sponsor friendly railways in the area itself.

==Midland and Eastern Railway==

The Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway and the Spalding and Bourn Railway amalgamated to form the Midland and Eastern Railway in 1866; the intention was to push westward to Saxby and join the Midland Railway there. This plan was opposed by the Great Northern Railway and the compromise was that the scheme was dropped, but that the Midland Railway was given running powers from over two GNR-sponsored lines: from Bourne to Essendine, and (by reversing there) from Essendine to Stamford; this was not a direct or fast route. The arrangement was agreed, and ratified by the Midland and Eastern Railway Act of 23 July 1866. The Midland and Eastern Railway was operated by the GNR and the Midland jointly, authorised by an Act of 1867.

The Midland and Eastern Railway leased the Norwich and Spalding line, but the N&amp;SR remained nominally independent until 1 July 1877. It needed to go to Parliament to plead that it had, in good faith, tried to make a Sutton to Wisbech line, but had been prevented; and that the line had in fact been pre-empted by the PB&amp;SBR; this was accepted and the M&amp;SR was released from the prohibition on declaring a dividend. The Midland and Eastern Railway now effectively controlled the whole of the western section of the future M&amp;GNJR, except for the Peterborough to Sutton Bridge line, which was still controlled by the Midland Railway.

The Midland and Eastern was jointly owned by the GNR and the Midland Railway, but it operated more or less independently. The Joint Committee did not meet between 1867 and 1880; trains of the two owning companies ran their own trains on the lines. In this period the network was referred to as the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway.

==GN and GE Joint Line==

For several years the Great Eastern Railway had been trying to get access to northern districts, and had been frustrated by the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s opposition. Nevertheless, the GER repeatedly presented bills for such lines, and the GNR calculated that it was only a matter of time until it was successful. This policy came to fruition in April 1878 during parliamentary hearings on a GER bill, and negotiations were set in place to establish what became the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Line, forming a through route from Doncaster to March via Lincoln.

The GNR and the Midland Railway had hitherto dominated the southward flow of Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire coal, and saw that the dominance was vulnerable. This led the GNR and the Midland to look favourably at further development of the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway (Midland and Eastern Railway).

==Sutton Bridge Dock failure==
In 1875 parliamentary sanction was obtained by an independent shipping company to develop Sutton Dock. Wisbech had traditionally been used as an inland port, but a Sutton Bridge Dock, connected to the railway network, could be advantageous, saving part of the difficult navigation up the River Nene. The GNR subscribed £20,000, calculating that this could be an export point for coal. The dock opened on 14 May 1881, and a short branch railway had been constructed to serve it. The day after the opening it was observed that the lock gates were not watertight, and in fact a general failure of the wall of the dock took place. Ships that had entered the dock were got away, but repairs to the dock were said to be impracticable, and the dock was not used again; the GNR had by then expended £55,000 on an unusable dock system.

==In the east==
===Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway===

Further east, it was not until 1876 that the first railway section of the future M&amp;GNJR was approved: the Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway was authorised on 27 June 1876; capital was £98,000. The line would run northwest for ; the Great Yarmouth terminal, later to be known as , was well situated for holidaymakers, but at this stage there was no connection to other railways. The first section, to , was opened on 7 August 1877.

From Ormesby to Hemsby opened on 16 May 1878, but there was a legal argument about a level crossing at Hemsby, and the next section to Martham opened from a temporary station north of the level crossing, on 15 July 1878. A temporary station south of the crossing was used from October. The legal position was resolved in Parliament in July 1879 and the permanent opened, and the two temporary stations closed.

Meanwhile, on 27 May 1878 the company got powers to extend to North Walsham, and to change its name to the Yarmouth and North Norfolk Light Railway, with additional capital of £60,000. Its status as a light railway was designed to prevent the Great Eastern Railway from acquiring running powers over the line. Successive openings took place: to Catfield on 17 January 1880 and on to Stalham on 3 July 1880.

===Lynn and Fakenham Railway===

On 13 July 1876 the Lynn and Fakenham Railway was authorised by Parliament, in the face of bitter opposition by GER interests. With capital of £150,000 it was to run from GER-influenced connections near King&#x27;s Lynn to near Fakenham. Surprisingly, the GER made no attempt to take control of this line, in fact making obstructions to the construction process. It was opened to Massingham on 16 August 1879, extending to Fakenham on 16 August 1880.

On 12 August 1880 the Lynn and Fakenham got approval to extend to Norwich, creating a much sought-after independent line to the city. The line was to pass through Melton Constable, and from that place there was to be a branch to Blakeney Harbour. On 11 August 1881 the Lynn and Fakenham and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk companies together managed at last to get powers to build from Melton Constable to North Walsham, which would connect their systems. In the same Act the Lynn and Fakenham got powers to build from Kelling to Cromer (not actually built), and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk was converted from a light railway to a full system, avoiding the speed and weight restrictions imposed by light railway status. The L&amp;FR opened from Fakenham to Guestwick on 19 January 1882, and from there to Lenwade on 1 July 1882. The final section to Norwich was opened on 2 December 1882. The Norwich station was named Norwich City from the outset. Melton to North Walsham was opened on 5 April 1883.

===Yarmouth Union Railway===

This short line, long, was authorised on 26 August 1880, to extend from the Yarmouth and North Norfolk station at to the quay, where it became effectively a tramway, joining the GE tramway there (but not facilitating any through running between the two systems.) The capital was £20,000. The YUR itself was slow to start work, but with the assistance of the Yarmouth and North Norfolk the work was pushed forward and completed on 15 May 1882.

==Amalgamation: the Eastern and Midlands Railway==

Now the many railway companies that were independent of the Great Eastern Railway saw that amalgamation with one another was desirable. On 18 August 1882 the Eastern and Midlands Railway Act was passed, which arranged that on the first day of 1883 the Eastern and Midlands Railway was created by amalgamating the Lynn and Fakenham Railway, the Yarmouth and North Norfolk, and the Yarmouth Union Railway. Shares generally were transferred to E&amp;MR stock, but some preference shareholders retained their rights. By the same Act a second stage arranged that the E&amp;MR took over the Midland and Eastern Railway on 1 July 1883. The MR and GNR working arrangements were to continue on those affected routes, and the E&amp;MR could only run trains on those section with the consent of those larger railways.

The whole line from Bourne to Great Yarmouth was now under the control of the Eastern and Midlands Railway. The train service at this stage was &quot;lavish&quot;, with six trains daily on the to section and seven from Melton to , with numerous short workings. On Sundays it was made possible to spend the day in Great Yarmouth, by running several trains throughout or connecting in to those trains.

==Further openings==
The section from Melton Constable to Holt was opened on 1 October 1884.

King&#x27;s Lynn was an important regional centre and port on the Ouse, and the E&amp;MR access to it was inconvenient, involving (from the east) reversal at the GER station for through trains, and reliance on that company&#x27;s grudging acquiescence. Thoughts had long harboured the intention of creating an independent through route and on 2 November 1885 the Lynn Loop was opened for goods traffic; passenger service followed on 1 January 1886. The line ran south of Lynn, connecting from South Lynn goods station to Bawsey. The former connection from Gaywood Road Junction, north of King&#x27;s Lynn, to Bawsey was closed. The railways had referred to the main station in King&#x27;s Lynn simply as &quot;Lynn&quot; but from this time &quot;Lynn Town&quot; was used instead.

After a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour, and opened on 16 June 1887. A through to express started running in August 1887, and although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable. A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction consisting of coaches slipped at from a GNR Manchester train. The time from King&#x27;s Cross to Cromer via Peterborough was typically hours, but the GER did to Cromer via Norwich in hours.

At this time the decision was taken not to go ahead with the Blakeney Harbour branch from Kelling.

On 20 June 1888 a new branch line from North Walsham to Mundesley, a small seaside resort was authorised by Parliament.

==Relationships with the Midland and the GNR==
For some years there had been continuing friction between the E&amp;MR (and its predecessors) and the Midland Railway over the routing for goods traffic. The E&amp;MR contended that the Midland was obliged to route its traffic to Norwich over the E&amp;MR and not the GER, notwithstanding the inferior travel times. The Midland repeatedly protested at tribunals that no such obligation existed. Now at last a sudden rapprochement took place. A bill was to be submitted to the 1888 session of Parliament to build a connecting line from the Midland Railway near Ashwell (in the vicinity of Oakham) and Bourne. The E&amp;MR was to build this with Midland financial help, and the following year the Midland would take over the entire western section. Traffic from the eastern section would be directed via the Midland.

At a stroke this would have cut the GNR out of much of the traffic, even though it had constantly been friendly and supportive of the E&amp;MR when the Midland had treated it shabbily. This was &quot;extraordinary conduct&quot; by the E&amp;MR. R. A. Read was a director, friendly to the Midland but prone to &quot;rash and elaborate schemes&quot;, and Wrottesley attributes these schemes to him.

Nevertheless, the new line was sanctioned on 28 June 1888, although a junction to the GNR at Little Bytham was inserted to mollify the GNR.

In the months following the passage of the Act, wiser counsels prevailed, and the E&amp;MR, Midland and GNR boards negotiated a more congenial arrangement. The Midland and GNR would become joint owners of the western section; the eastern section would be unaffected for the time being. The route of the Bourne connecting line to the Midland would be varied, to meet the Midland at Saxby; the connection to the GNR main line at Little Bytham would be retained; and the connecting line west of that point would be Midland property, not E&amp;MR. Ordinary shareholders in the E&amp;MR would get £47 for every £100 worth. A joint committee met at King&#x27;s Cross on 5 March 1889; it was a Midland and Great Northern Joint Committee, but at this stage no such designation was applied to the railway itself.

===Eastern and Midlands Railway in chancery===
At the moment when the future seemed satisfactory, the E&amp;MR was plunged into crisis. For some years it had been paying only modest dividends, and profitability had not always been adequate to support outgoings. W. Jones had been hiring carriages to the company and for some time had not been paid. On 27 June 1889 he obtained judgment in his favour, but the company had no money to comply. At the time there was a system established since 1867 intended to keep a railway in operation for the convenience of the public in this situation: in effect to trade out of bankruptcy.

The &quot;rash&quot; R. A. Read was appointed receiver, and at a shareholders&#x27; meeting in November 1889 it was stated that the company had liabilities of over £108,000 on working costs as well as £71,645 on unpaid debenture interest and guaranteed share dividends. At a further meeting on 2 May 1890 the debenture holders accused Read of being to blame for getting the line into this situation, and demanded his removal, as well as a declaration that their debenture payments should rank equally with the railway operating costs, contrary to normal practice when a line was in receivership. Appeals were eventually dismissed and despite the legal and financial difficulties the railway kept running. It was not until 16 August 1892 that a scheme of financial arrangement was finalised.

===Improvements despite the crisis===
While this was continuing, some capital improvements took place, largely funded by the Midland Railway. Signalling was modernised, some additional crossing places were established as well as some short lengths of double track, and the Bourne to Saxby line continued to be built. On 25 July 1890 an avoiding line at Spalding was authorised, enabling through running past the south of the town. It opened for goods traffic on 5 June 1893, and on the same day the Saxby to Bourne section opened, also for goods only. On 28 June 1892 the Sutton Bridge was authorised to be renewed. It opened on 18 July 1897; it was a swing bridge, and carried road and rail traffic. There were tolls on the road part of the bridge, but these were given up in 1902.

The words Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway appeared in public timetables for the first time in 1890.

==The M&amp;GNJR is formed==

The 1889 arrangement whereby the Midland and GNR jointly took over E&amp;MR lines applied only to the western section. Now in 1891 the two larger companies indicated that they wished to acquire the eastern section too. This was agreed in October 1892, and a Bill was submitted to the 1893 session of Parliament. The consideration was £1,200,000 of Midland and GNR 3% rent stock, although there were complicated provisions for preference and debenture shareholders. Both eastern and western sections transferred to the M&amp;GNJR.

With only minor interference from the GER, the new arrangement passed in Parliament on 9 June 1893: the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway would become an incorporated entity (rather than just a committee delegated by the two principals). A total of of railway was involved, so that the M&amp;GNJR network was the longest joint railway in the United Kingdom, by mileage.

==Further projects==
===Saxby and the Spalding avoiding line opened to passengers===
On 1 May 1894 the Bourne to Saxby line was opened to passengers, with additional platforms at Saxby. The formation was made for a southward connecting curve there, but track was never laid on it. The boundary with the Joint Line was at Little Bytham as planned, and the formation of the connection to the GNR was also made, and here too track was never laid on it. The Spalding avoiding line was opened to passenger traffic on the same day, 1 May 1894.

===Mundesley to Cromer===
An Act of 7 August 1896 authorised the M&amp;GJR to build on from (not yet open) to Cromer, passing south of the town and curving back to approach it from the west.

===The Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway===

Both the GER and the M&amp;GNJR wanted to build a direct coastal line between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft; the coastal area and Lowestoft itself were developing and offered the M&amp;GNJR much potential. At the same time the GER wished to develop its access to Mundesley. Notwithstanding the friction between the two companies, a sensible accommodation was finalised on 18 March 1897 by which the GER bill for the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line and a Mundesley to Happisburgh line would not be opposed by the M&amp;GNJR. The M&amp;GNJR would simply build a connecting curve from its line swinging round the north and west of Yarmouth and connecting in to the new GER line, and have running powers to Lowestoft. A Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway company would be created, and would control the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line (from Gorleston), the North Walsham to Mundesley line, Mundesley to Cromer, and Mundesley to Happisburgh.

The M&amp;GNJR Bill for the curve at Yarmouth passed in Parliament on 6 August 1897, and the establishment of the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway was enacted on 25 July 1898. The Lowestoft line opened on 13 July 1903.

===Opening to Mundesley===
The Mundesley branch opened for goods traffic on 20 June 1898, and to passengers on 1 July 1898. As a joint line (from Antingham Road Junction) it had passenger trains of both companies: nine GER and seven M&amp;GNJR daily. Goods services alternated month by month.

==From 1900==
In the first years of the 20th century the M&amp;GNJR was doing well financially. Long-distance expresses were run to the area from northern English cities as well as from London. Restaurant cars were put on, as well as workers&#x27; trains, for example bringing fish-processing women from northern Scotland for seasonal work. Fish had become an important traffic since the N&amp;SJR connection to Lowestoft had been established.

Although some short sections of double track had been introduced, the majority of the network was single line, and this brought challenges to timekeeping at busy times. The Midland and GNR were operating trains on the line as of right, and the GER had acquired running powers over several sections and to some terminal stations. Conversely the M&amp;GNJR needed the cooperation of the GER for some penetrating workings, at a time when competition with the GER was still intense.

In May 1906 the committee approved introduction of the Whitaker tablet exchange apparatus. On single-track sections, head-on collision due to signalman error was prevented by a token system: drivers of trains entering a single line section must be in possession of a physical token, a &quot;tablet&quot; specific to that section, and one only could only be released from control equipment in the one or other of the two signalboxes controlling entry to the section. When the train had passed through the section the tablet was placed in the apparatus at that end of the section, and only now another might be released either there or at the other end of the section. When non-stopping trains passed the tablet had to be passed from the signalman to the fireman of the train, and this could not be done at speed without injury. Whitaker devised a mechanical apparatus to be placed at the lineside and on locomotives to enable the exchange at a higher speed.

During World War I many of the best long-distance express passenger trains were suspended; the M&amp;GNJR took on considerable additional goods traffic during hostilities, and many of the workforce left for the armed forces. The company maintained an armoured train, constructed by the London and North Western Railway at Crewe, continuously in steam from early in 1915 in case of enemy invasion.

After 1918, government control of the railways continued, and much traffic in demobilised servicemen tested the capacity of the network. There was a general railway strike in the latter months of 1919, and a coal strike in 1921, both of which caused considerable damage to the M&amp;GNJR. The national general strike took place in 1926.

==Grouping of the railways==
Wartime control of the railways ended on 15 August 1921, and the government passed the Railways Act 1921, which had the effect of transferring most of the railways of Great Britain into one of four new large companies, in a process referred to as the &quot;grouping&quot;. The Midland Railway was transferred to the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the Great Northern Railway (as well as the Great Eastern Railway) were transferred to the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The M&amp;GNJR remained unchanged, now jointly owned by the LMS and LNER. The rivalry with the GER was naturally at an end. The change took place formally on 1 January 1923.

The long-distance express trains were reinstated progressively, and the LNER particularly emphasised to traffic. Holidays at the seaside increased in popularity very considerably after the war, and as well as trains to and from the area, local services for holidaymakers staying in the area were enhanced in the season.

However road competition, both for goods and passengers, began to take a serious toll as roads were improved. at the same time a general depression in the agricultural sector harmed M&amp;GNJR income.

===Incorporation into the LNER===
The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway had retained its identity at the grouping of the railways in 1923. In the mid-1930s there was good cooperation between the LMS and the LNER and in 1935 it was agreed that the LNER should manage the operational aspects of the M&amp;GNJR system, though maintaining its independent identity. This took effect from 1 October 1936. The system consisted of , of which 40% was double track.

==World War II and after==
In 1939 World War II started, and once again most long-distance expresses were suspended; staff were called up or volunteered in the services. However the focus of defence, evacuation of children, and later the D-day landings was the south coast, not the east. The war ended in 1945. The railways were run down during the war and the government passed the Transport Act 1947, so that the railways became nationalised at the beginning of 1948, forming British Railways (BR).

The long distance and holiday trains began to be restored, and holiday camp facilities became popular, and were served by the line.

===Local closures===
The very low usage of some parts of the M&amp;GNJR system under BR could not be ignored, and some local closures started:

* On 6 April 1953 the to section was closed.
* On 21 September 1953 the to section closed.
* The ex-GER station was closed on 20 September 1954, services being concentrated on the M&amp;GNJR station, Cromer Beach, which was extended and improved for the purpose.
* , and stations closed to passengers in 1957 and closed to passengers in 1958.

===Diesel trains===
Diesel multiple unit vehicles were introduced on the M&amp;GNJR from 18 September 1955, gradually taking over the entire passenger service except the long-distance trains which remained locomotive-hauled.

==Total closure==
In May 1958 a report was finalised by British Railways. It concluded that the entirety of the M&amp;GNJR was loss-making, and was largely duplicated by routes of the former GER. Complete closure of passenger services was proposed. Widespread closure of goods services too was contemplated, with only the Spalding to Sutton Bridge, Peterborough to Wisbech, South Lynn to Gayton Road, and Melton Constable to Norwich City being kept. Only the Melton to Cromer branch was to be unaffected by the proposals. The scale of the closure aroused considerable opposition, mainly focussed on the reduction in amenity to communities, although there was also widespread apathy, reflected in poor turnouts at public meetings.

After deliberation the Transport Users Consultative Committee issued its decision in November 1958, that the majority of the proposed closures should proceed. Retained sections were Spalding to Bourne for goods, Spalding to Sutton Bridge for goods. A new spur would be built at Murrow connecting the M&amp;GN line with the GN&amp;GE Joint line; the Peterborough to Wisbech line would be disconnected at the Peterborough end, and served via the Murrow curve from Whitemoor, at March. Wisbech too would be retained and served from Whitemoor via Murrow. Further east the Melton Constable to Norwich line would remain open for goods trains, as would the South Lynn to Rudham line. Passenger trains would continue to operate between Melton Constable and Cromer, and between North Walsham and Mundesley. Yarmouth Vauxhall (the former GER station) would be extended to handle the additional seasonal passenger traffic.

The closures took place after the last trains on Saturday 28 February 1959. There was much greater public attention to the running of the last passenger trains than there had been to attending the public meetings, but the closure was decisive.

Notwithstanding the dire warnings of protesters, a substitute bus service operating from Melton Mowbray to Spalding following closely the route of the railway was almost completely lacking in patronage, and was soon given up.

The Melton Constable to Sheringham line had retained its passenger services for the time being; however that too closed to passengers after 4 April 1964. North Walsham to Mundesley closed on 5 October 1964.

The Spalding to Sutton Bridge goods connection closed after Friday 2 April 1965.

==Key people==
For over 40 years William Marriott served the M&amp;GN and its predecessors, joining the staff of the original contractors, Wilkinson and Jarvis in 1881, serving as Engineer from 1883, Locomotive Superintendent from 1884 and finally becoming Traffic Manager as well in 1919, before retiring in 1924. He is commemorated in the name of the Marriott&#x27;s Way footpath, much of which follows the trackbed of the M&amp;GN Norwich line, and in the work of the North Norfolk Railway

==Murrow flat crossing==
At Murrow the M&amp;GNJR crossed the GN&amp;GE Joint Line on the level, one of few such crossings in the UK, and the only one where two joint lines crossed.

==Locomotives==
Because of the relatively early closure date, most workings throughout the life of the M&amp;GN were operated by steam power. A small number of diesel multiple unit services were run in the final years, alongside the very occasional incursions of early diesel locomotives.

The M&amp;GN mainly used designs from the MR and GNR, but included in its stock some of the older E&amp;M engines, often much rebuilt. The famous Beyer-Peacock engines survived in this way from the early 1880s to the mid-1930s. The best contemporary designs were acquired by the Joint in the 1893 – 1901 period, but as there were no more modern engines forthcoming, the light 0-6-0s and 4-4-0s provided much of the motive power on the line until 1936. From then on the LNER tried various designs on the line, not necessarily bigger or even more recent than the Joint&#x27;s own engines, but as the M&amp;GN&#x27;s engines were scrapped, newer engines such as the K2 2-6-0s and B12 4-6-0s became common. The ex-GER D16 &quot;Claud Hamilton&quot; 4-4-0s provided the locomotive backbone of this later period.

From the 1950s, Ivatt 4MTs became the dominant motive power on the system, which achieved a higher degree of standardisation than any other part of British Railways—more than 50 of these &quot;mucky ducks&quot; were allocated here. But there were other types still in use, and among them the line saw Ivatt 2MTs and occasional Standard 4MT and LNER B1 and B17 types.

British Railways&#x27; Eastern Region was an early adopter of diesel motive power and the M&amp;GN lines were used by Brush Type 2 locomotives and several early DMU types including Class 101 and Class 105s. A fleet of the latter was commissioned in the mid-1950s to take over all the long-distance locomotive-hauled passenger services, but the line&#x27;s closure in 1959 saw them re-allocated (especially to the Great Northern suburban commuter workings out of King&#x27;s Cross, for which they were particularly unsuitable).
One M&amp;GN boiler from a Hudswell Clarke 4-4-0T survives, it is hoped this will be rebuilt as a static exhibit.

===Badge and livery===
The M&amp;GN device consists of images derived from the coats of arms of the four principal cities and towns it served: (clockwise from top left) Peterborough, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King&#x27;s Lynn.

For much of the company&#x27;s life the locomotives were painted a light golden brown, often referred to by paintshop staff as &quot;autumn leaf&quot; or &quot;golden ochre&quot;. From 1922 the goods engines were painted dark brown, followed by the rest of the locomotives in 1929. The LNER painted the survivors black. Most of the carriages were ex-GNR and were varnished teak, but some of the older stock and rebuilds were painted and grained to look like teak. Wagon stock was generally brown oxide, the same colour as the GNR used, until 1917 when general stock under the common user agreement began to be painted grey. The number of M&amp;GN wagons declined during the 1920s, and were eventually bought by the parent companies in 1928, leaving only service stock, which was painted red oxide. Under British Railways&#x27; control, carriages were often carmine and cream, then maroon.
==Cultural impact and heritage==

The M&amp;GN was frequently referred to as the &quot;Muddle and Go Nowhere&quot;, a fairly self-evident title for a route that served a mostly rural region, but after closure this phrase was commonly replaced with &quot;Missed and Greatly Needed&quot;.

The M&amp;GN&#x27;s memory is kept alive by two heritage railway operations and railway museums. Whilst only the short section between Cromer Beach and Sheringham remains open to regular services, the section of branch line between Sheringham and Holt is operated as the North Norfolk Railway. The station at Whitwell also operates as a heritage centre, with ambitions to restore a section of the M&amp;GN main line. There is also a group dedicated to the study of the line: the M&amp;GN Circle.

M&amp;GN signal boxes survive at numerous locations, with Cromer Beach box being open to the public. The box from Honing also survives at the Barton House Railway near Wroxham.

The turntable from Bourne engine shed has also survived. This turntable was built in Ipswich in 1933 and installed at Bourne. When the shed closed along with the line in 1959 it was transferred to Peterborough East railway station. After that shed closed the turntable was rebuilt at Wansford station on the Nene Valley railway

Very little rolling stock from the line has been preserved. The North Norfolk Railway have rescued a brake van. Another M&amp;GN brake van survives, No. 23 which was built in 1899, was rescued from Melton Constable in 2000. Two M&amp;GN coaches survive, both at Eccles on Sea. No locomotives survived, with the last complete locomotive being scrapped at the Longmoor Military Railway in 1953.

The &quot;golden ochre&quot; livery has been carried by two industrial locomotives on the North Norfolk Railway, and was later worn by a bus operated by Norfolk Green on routes formerly served by the company.

<text>Bentilee is a housing estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, between Hanley and Longton, and parallel with Fenton.

==History==
Built in the 1950s, Bentilee was at that time one of the largest estates in Europe, with around 4,500 properties. The streets in the area are named after various places in the UK e.g. &quot;Winchester&quot; Avenue, &quot;Chelmsford&quot; Drive, and &quot;Devonshire&quot; Square.

Originally, it consisted almost wholly of social housing, managed by Stoke City Council. The Right to Buy brought in by the Conservative government of the 1980s led to many of the semi-detached houses that make up most of the housing stock in the area being bought by their tenants, so that now approximately 25% of local houses are privately owned.

In the 1990s, the estate&#x27;s 925 cottage flats were transferred to the management of Bentilee Community Housing Limited (now called EPIC), under the Estates Action scheme that provided government funding to bring the properties up to a modern standard with many receiving new kitchens, new bathrooms, central heating, double-glazing, and rewiring.

==Recent developments==
In recent history, the estate has also been the subject of a 7-year-long Villages Initiative Single Regeneration Budget (Round 2) urban renewal scheme that aimed to do for the remaining council housing what the Estates Action scheme had done for the cottage flats (but without transferring ownership away from the Council), as well as tackling local social issues and full- or part-funding a wide range of local projects such as Berryhill Retirement Village, the Millennium Project on the Berryhill Fields that separate Bentilee from Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, and building the Moss Green housing estate (managed by Riverside Housing).

Seven years was not long enough to complete the ambitious plans for the redevelopment of the estate&#x27;s main shopping and services area so the Bentilee District Centre Project was set up to carry on this work. The final result is a single building comprising shopping facilities, local library, IT Centre, walk-in health centre, and the CAB — unique in the UK.

In 2013 Discovery Academy was built on the site of the former Willfield Centre. Discovery Academy replaced Mitchell High School in Bucknall and Edensor High School in Longton. This high school is now a part of the Alpha Academy Trust, along with Excel Academy in Hanley, Maple Court Primary School and another primary school.

<text>&quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; is a song written by Johnny Bristol, Jackey Beavers, and Harvey Fuqua. It was the last of twelve American number-one pop singles for Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes on the Motown label. Although it was released as the final Supremes song featuring Diana Ross, who left the group for a solo career in January 1970, it was recorded as Ross&#x27; first solo single and Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not sing on the recording. Both appear on the B-side, &quot;He&#x27;s My Sunny Boy&quot;.

The single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart for one week, in the final 1969 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine (dated December 27). It would be the last number one hit of the 1960s.

==Background==

===Original version===
The song was written by Johnny Bristol, Jackey Beavers, and Harvey Fuqua in 1961; Bristol and Beavers recorded the song together as &quot;Johnny &amp; Jackey&quot; for the Tri-Phi label that same year. &quot;Someday&quot; was a moderate success in the Midwestern United States, but gained little notice in other venues.

Tri-Phi was purchased by Motown in the mid-1960s. Fuqua, Bristol, and Beavers all joined Berry Gordy&#x27;s by-then famous record company, and &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; became part of Motown&#x27;s Jobete publishing catalog. Beavers soon departed for Chess Records, although both Bristol and Fuqua stayed on as songwriters and producers for Motown.

===Supremes version===
In 1969, Bristol was preparing a new version of &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, to be recorded by Motown act Jr. Walker &amp; the All-Stars. Bristol had already recorded the instrumental track and the background vocals when Berry Gordy happened upon the tracks and heard them. Gordy thought that &quot;Someday&quot; would be a perfect first solo single for Diana Ross, who was making her long-expected exit from the Supremes at the time, and had Bristol sequester Ross into the studio to record the song.

Unable at first to get the vocal performance he desired from Ross, Johnny Bristol decided to try something different: he would harmonize with her, helping Ross to get into the mood needed for the record. On the first take, the engineer accidentally recorded both Ross&#x27;s vocal and Bristol&#x27;s ad-libs. Bristol and arranger Wade Marcus liked the results, and Bristol had his vocal recorded alongside Ross&#x27; for the final version of the song. Bristol&#x27;s ad-libs and words of encouragement to Ross can be heard in the background throughout the song. When Berry Gordy heard the completed song, he decided to release it as the final Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes song. Neither of the Supremes&#x27; remaining members, however, sang on the record. Ross&#x27;s first solo single instead, released in early 1970, became &quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody&#x27;s Hand)&quot;.

Even though the implicit subject of the song was that of Ross comforting a long-distance lover, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; allowed for other interpretations, one being that Ross and bandmates Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong would one day nostalgically &quot;be together&quot; again. Further, in concert, Ross would suggest that &quot;someday, we&#x27;ll be together&quot; in regard to contemporary troubles such as civil rights and the ongoing demonstrations and protests against the Vietnam War.

====Release====
&quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; was included on the final Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes album, &quot;Cream of the Crop&quot; (1969). The song was a United States number-one hit on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 popular singles chart and the R&amp;B singles chart, as well as charting in the top twenty at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. It also peaked on the Netherlands&#x27; MegaCharts at #19 in 1970. &quot;Someday&#x27;s&quot; B-side, &quot;He&#x27;s My Sunny Boy&quot;, was recorded by Ross, Wilson, and Birdsong for the &quot;Love Child&quot; album in 1968 and written and produced by Smokey Robinson.

&quot;Someday&quot; charted at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 popular singles chart for one week, on December 27, 1969.It also charted at number-one on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles chart for four weeks, from December 13, 1969, to January 3, 1970. &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; therefore appeared in &quot;Billboard&quot; as both the final Hot 100 &quot;and&quot; R&amp;B number-one of the 1960s, and as the first R&amp;B number-one of the 1970s.

====Notable live performances====
The girl group made their final of several performances throughout the decade with Diana Ross singing lead on the 1960s decennial finale of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; that aired live Sunday, December 21, 1969, on CBS.

&quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; was the final number at Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&#x27; farewell concert on January 14, 1970, at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. After the completion of the show, Jean Terrell was presented onstage to the audience as Diana Ross&#x27; replacement (alongside Wilson and Birdsong). Thus &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot; officially split apart, becoming &quot;Diana Ross&quot; (the solo act) and &quot;The Supremes&quot; (the group).

Ross reunited with Wilson and Birdsong in 1983, performing the single for the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; television special. However, this long anticipated performance was cut short mostly owing to lack of rehearsal after more than a decade of the group being apart. There is much speculation regarding the onstage exchange that took place between Ross and Wilson, but some audience members report it resulted in Ross shoving Wilson during the on-stage performance. A heavily edited version of this performance was aired on national television and released on the DVD of &quot;Motown 25&quot;.

<doc id="1165141" wikidata="Q133620" url="?curid=1165141" title="Seibu Tamagawa Line">
<text>The is an railway line in the western suburbs of Tokyo operated by the private railway operator Seibu Railway. The line connects Musashi-Sakai Station on the Chūō Main Line with Koremasa Station along the Tama River. The line has only six stations and is not connected to any other part of the Seibu Railway system. The only connection to any other rail line is a rarely used maintenance connection to the JR East Chūō Main Line (just west of ) that is used to transfer trains requiring inspection or major repairs to Seibu&#x27;s Musashigaoka Vehicle Inspection and Repair Shop. 

The Seibu Tamagawa Line is single-track: trains traveling in opposite directions pass each other as necessary at the stations, which are double-track. , during 12-minute frequency trains pass at and , and during 20-minute frequency trains pass at only. 

Although the line is short, it provides access to the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, the Tokyo Racecourse, the Ajinomoto Stadium, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department police school, many cemeteries (including Tokyo&#x27;s largest, Tama Cemetery), the American School in Japan, and the Tama River.

== Services ==
All services on the Seibu Tamagawa Line are Local trains, stopping at all stations.

, trains operate every 12 minutes between 06:30 and 22:00 every day, and approximately every 20 minutes in the early morning and late at night.

Running time is 12 minutes towards Koremasa and 14 minutes towards Musashi-Sakai.

==Stations==
‡ 

==Rolling stock==

Since March 2010, the line&#x27;s services are operated exclusively by a fleet of 4 x 4-car New 101 Series trains. These trains are wrapped with different liveries on various occasions. At other times the New 101 Series trains typically operate in a white livery. 

The train depot for the Tamagawa Line trains is adjacent to Shiraitodai Station. 

===Liveries===

==== Izu Hakone Color ====
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Tamagawa Line from 2017 to 2018, which coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Izu Hakone Railway, the two lines celebrated by adopting each other&#x27;s liveries.

==== Akaden painting ====
By request from a questionnaire at the 100th-anniversary event of the Tamagawa Line, from January 24, 2018, Seibu Railway&#x27;s old livery &quot;Akaden Paint&quot; (red x beige) was used.

==== Two-tone color ====
From April 18, 2018, the trains were repainted with the two-tone color of yellow &amp; beige. The paint color is derived from the livery that was used during the time of the debut of the New 101 series train. The livery was also used before the fleet renewal of 2010, as the Old 101 Series train was featured in the same livery. This livery was the most requested after Akaden painting in the questionnaire at the 100th-anniversary event of Tamagawa Line. 

==== Omi Railway Color (1251 formation) ====
From July 11, 2018, To commemorate the 120th anniversary of the Ohmi Railway and the 100th anniversary of the Tamagawa Line a wrapping featuring the &quot;Mizuumifugo&quot; (light blue) livery was introduced.

===Former Rolling Stock===

Before the New 101 series, the line&#x27;s services were operated by the Old 101 series (also referred to as &quot;Original 101 series&quot;), which were in use from 1996 to 2010. These trains originally were introduced as &quot;One-Man&quot; (ワンマン) services. Prior to the One-Man train service on the New 101 Series, the following trains were also used: 401 series &amp; , which had been transferred from the Shinjuku line system to the Tamagawa line, and the , , &amp; , which were called Akaden trains due to their red and beige livery. 

==History==
The first section of the line, between Musashi-Sakai and Kita-Tama Station (present-day Shiraitodai Station), opened on 22 October 1917. The line was extended to Koremasa on 20 June 1922. In 1927, the company was absorbed by the Seibu Railway. The entire line was electrified in 1950. Freight operations ceased in 1967.

<doc id="1165145" wikidata="Q3530145" url="?curid=1165145" title="Tobias Matthew">
<text>Tobias Matthew (also Tobie and Toby; 13 June 154629 March 1628), was an Anglican bishop who was President of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1572 to 1576, before being appointed Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1579 to 1583, and Matthew would then become Dean of Durham from 1583 to 1595. All three positions, plus others, were appointed to Matthew by Elizabeth I. Eventually, he was appointed Archbishop of York in 1606 by Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, James I.

==Early life==
He was the son of Sir John Matthew of Ross in Herefordshire, England, and of his wife Eleanor Crofton of Ludlow. Tobias was born at Bristol on 13 June 1546.

Matthew was educated at Wells, Somerset, and then in succession at University College and Christ Church, Oxford. He proceeded BA in 1564, and MA in 1566.

==Ties to Elizabeth I==
He attracted the favourable notice of Elizabeth I, and his rise was steady though not quite rapid. He was first appointed a public orator in Oxford in 1569, and then President of St John&#x27;s in 1572, Dean of Christ Church in 1576, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1579, Dean of Durham in 1583, Bishop of Durham in 1595, and Archbishop of York in 1606.

After the Union of the Crowns, in June 1603 James VI and I sent his courtiers Roger Aston and James Hudson to give the Bishop his command to travel north to meet Anne of Denmark, who was bringing Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth to Windsor Castle.

==Years as Archbishop==

In 1581, Matthew had a controversy with the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and published at Oxford his arguments in 1638 under the title, &quot;Piissimi et eminentissimi viri Tobiae Matthew, archiepiscopi olim Eboracencis concio apologetica adversus Campianam&quot;. While in the north he was active in forcing the recusants to conform to the Church of England, preaching hundreds of sermons and carrying out thorough visitations.

In 1617, he delegated his trusted lieutenant Phineas Hodson to advise Roger Brearley, who had founded the Grindletonian nonconformist sect and been accused of heresy as a result, on how he might reconcile with the Church of England.

==Final years and death==
During his later years he was to some extent in opposition to the administration of King James I. He was exempted from attendance in the parliament of 1625 on the ground of age and infirmities. His wife, Frances, was the daughter of William Barlow, Bishop of Chichester. His son, Tobie Matthew was an MP and later a convert to Roman Catholicism. Tobias died at Cawood on 29 March 1628 at 81 years old; he was buried in the Lady Chapel of York Minster.

Matthew left his fortune not to his sons or the church but to his wife Frances Matthew. Amongst his possessions were 600 books, valued then at £300. Frances later give them all to York Minster. These books are the basis of the library (now at Old Palace, York). Frances had been his wife for over fifty years and she died the following year and was buried in York Minster&#x27;s lady chapel.

<text>The Allnatt Diamond is a diamond measuring 101.29 carats (20.258 g) with a cushion cut, rated in color as Fancy Vivid Yellow by the Gemological Institute of America. This diamond was named after one of its holders, Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt, a soldier, sportsman, art patron and benefactor.

The Allnatt&#x27;s origins are unknown prior to Major Allnatt&#x27;s purchasing of the diamond in the early 1950s. After purchasing the diamond, he commissioned Cartier to make a setting for it. The final setting was a platinum flower with five petals, a stem and two leaves, all set with diamonds. The Allnatt was resold at auction in May 1996 by Christie&#x27;s in Geneva for $3,043,496 US. At the time of its sale the Allnatt was . and was graded Fancy Intense Yellow. After being sold to the SIBA Corporation, the diamond was re-cut to its current weight and the intensity was upgraded as a result.

The Allnatt was displayed as part of the Smithsonian&#x27;s &quot;The Splendor of Diamonds&quot; exhibit, alongside The De Beers Millennium Star and The Heart of Eternity.

<doc id="1165155" wikidata="Q6521576" url="?curid=1165155" title="Lemuel Shaw">
<text>Lemuel Shaw (January 9, 1781 – March 30, 1861) was an American jurist who served as chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (1830–1860). Prior to his appointment he also served for several years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and as a state senator. In 1847, Shaw became the father-in-law of author Herman Melville. He ruled on prominent cases involving slavery, segregation, and religion.

==Early life and education==
Shaw was born in West Barnstable, Massachusetts, the second son of the Rev. Oakes Shaw and his second wife Susanna, who was a daughter of John H. Hayward of Braintree. The Shaws were descendants of Abraham Shaw (January 2, 1590 – November 2, 1638), who left Halifax, England in 1636 and settled in Dedham. Oakes Shaw, a Congregationalist minister, was pastor of the West Church in Barnstable for forty-seven years. Lemuel was named for his uncle, Dr. Hayward of Boston, father of George Hayward, the surgeon.

Educated at home by his father except for a few months at Braintree, he entered Harvard in 1796. There, he taught school in winter vacations. After graduating with high honors in 1800, he taught for a year in a Boston public school, and wrote articles and read proof for the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;, a Federalist newspaper.

In August 1801, he began studying law in Boston under David Everett. Meanwhile, he learned French proficiently from a refugee, Antoine Jay, afterwards a founder in France of the liberal newspaper &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot;. In 1802, he moved with Everett to Amherst, New Hampshire, where besides doing legal work he contributed a poem on dancing and translations from French to the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Cabinet&quot;, a local newspaper. He became engaged to Nancy Melvill, daughter of Maj. Thomas Melvill of Boston (the subject of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.&#x27;s poem &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;) but she died soon afterward.

==Legal and political career==
Admitted to the bar in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, in September 1804, and in Plymouth County, Massachusetts that November, Shaw began practice in Boston. When his associate left Boston after being acquitted of murder in a political quarrel, he practiced alone for fifteen years.

In about 1822, Shaw took Sidney Bartlett, an able trial lawyer, as his junior partner. His practice gradually became large, but he was less known as an advocate than as the adviser of important commercial enterprises.

In politics, Shaw was first a Federalist and later a Webster Whig, but remained all his life a free-trader. He attended Unitarian services, though he was never a communicant. Fond of entertaining and dining out, he was simple and affectionate in his home life, his interest in the social events of his household extending to the minutest details.

Shaw was prepared for his judicial career by numerous public positions. He was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving in 1811–14, 1820 and 1829, and as a state senator in 1821–22. He served as a member of the constitutional convention of 1820. He also held many offices in Boston. Shaw was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823.

In 1822, with few precedents to guide him, he drafted the first charter of the city, which lasted until 1913.

==Chief Justice of Massachusetts==
On the death of Chief Justice Isaac Parker, Governor Levi Lincoln offered Shaw an appointment as chief justice. Daniel Webster successfully urged Shaw to accept, though it meant giving up a practice of $15,000 to $20,000 a year for a salary of $3,500. And for this, if nothing else, Webster later thought the public owed him a debt of gratitude. Shaw&#x27;s commission was issued on August 30, 1830. He served for almost exactly 30 years, resigning on August 21, 1860.

During his tenure as Chief Justice, Shaw authored over 2,150 legal opinions, and presided over a similar number of trials. Many of his legal opinions would help shape American law and jurisprudence. His exceptionally long judicial career coincided with the development of many important industries and, coincidentally, Shaw made law on such matters as water power, railroads, and other public utilities. Some commentators have argued that Shaw had more influence on the development of American law than any other state court judge in the country&#x27;s history. One hundred years after he came onto the court as Chief Justice, it was observed that his legal opinions influenced the United States Supreme Court, the development of the common law in every American state, and were observed favorably in England. At a minimum, he was among the leading early to mid-Nineteenth Century American state court judges, such as Chancellor James Kent (New York), Theophilus Parsons (Massachusetts), John Bannister Gibson (Pennsylvania), Thomas Ruffin (North Carolina), Peter Hitchcock (Ohio), and Francios Xavier Martin (Louisiana), who were building their courts and the law in the early history of the United States. In developing the common law, Shaw adapted traditional common law principles in innovative ways to adjudicate disputes arising out of the rapidly changing circumstances and conditions in the world around him, that occurred during his 30-year tenure.

Shaw&#x27;s opinions were not often readily quotable and are instead recognized for solid reasoning. &quot;His words had weight rather than brilliancy or eloquence.&quot; His reputation as a jurist lies mostly in the substance of his work, as opposed to the literary quality of his writings for the court.

In Shaw&#x27;s time on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the chief justice often sat at trials. In the role of a trial judge, he was considered to be thorough, systematic, and patient. He was also renowned for his ability to clearly instruct juries.

===Slavery and civil rights===
Because of Boston&#x27;s strong abolitionist movement, Shaw oversaw numerous cases related to slave law and race.

In 1836, Shaw&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Commonwealth v. Aves&quot; held that a slave brought voluntarily into Massachusetts, a free state, was a &quot;sojourner,&quot; or a journeyer, and not taking domicile in that state. Therefore, slaves could be brought into the state only for a limited time. Abolitionists, who had brought the habeas corpus suit, wanted a rule which would have freed the girl, while southern defenders of the practice wanted the court to uphold the concept of comity and acknowledge the legality of slavery. Shaw attempted to split the decision by applying the archaic &quot;sojourner&quot; status to slaves.

Further, Shaw rejected the doctrine of interstate comity. In his strict understanding, comity is a vehicle for facilitating trade and amicable interactions between jurisdictions. Therefore, Shaw reasoned that a state or jurisdiction is not required to honor comity if in doing so it is sanctioning practices repugnant to the state&#x27;s own norms.

The &quot;Aves&quot; case caused an uproar in the South where planters accused the Northerners of denying their equal sovereign status. Shaw also drew criticism from conservative jurists in other Northern states, as in &quot;State v. Post&quot; (N.J. 1845), which stated that New Jersey still allowed slavery.

His ruling in favor of the constitutionality of school segregation in &quot;Roberts v. City of Boston&quot; (1849) established &quot;separate but equal&quot; as a legal doctrine in the state.

In a later case, he again refused to release fugitive slave Thomas Sims on &quot;habeas corpus&quot; grounds, as he felt bound by the Constitution and the law, as the recent Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required states and local governments to cooperate in the capture of escaped slaves. Sims&#x27; Case was the first by any court in the United States to uphold the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act.

===&quot;Commonwealth v. Webster&quot; (1850)===
No single case brought Shaw such criticism or such respect as the Parkman–Webster murder case, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;Commonwealth v. Webster&quot;, held in Boston in March 1850.

While Shaw was Chief Justice, the Supreme Judicial Court still possessed exclusive jurisdiction over all capital crimes: capital cases were tried by a jury presided over by the Chief Justice attended by his associate justices. At such a trial all points of law were argued fully by counsel and settled on the spot by decisions as &quot;final and conclusive&quot; as those of the highest appellate court on a bill of exceptions.

Such an accommodation was rooted in the consideration that the defendant and the public had a unique interest in securing, in the first instance, a verdict based on correct and authoritative rulings and, therefore, in avoiding repeated trials.

The trial lasted eleven days with the court sitting from nine in the morning until seven in the evening with a lunch break of one and one-half hours. Joel Parker, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Chief Justice of New Hampshire, 1838 to 1848, noted that &quot;the trial, in the course of its progress, was a cause of extreme excitement, extending through the whole length and breadth of the land, and reaching even into foreign countries.&quot; On March 30, after the defense&#x27;s closing remarks were concluded, after the prosecution&#x27;s closing remarks lasting nearly five hours and after a brief un-sworn statement by the defendant himself, Chief Justice Shaw delivered a three-hours-long charge to the jury.

Frederick Hathaway Chase in his 1918 biography of Shaw wrote: &quot;Probably no charge ever delivered in this country has been followed as a precedent so frequently and so closely as this memorable effort. With the dignity of expression and the clearness of thought and language ... he expounded the law of homicide in terms which have been followed closely in nearly every murder trial from that day to this.&quot;

In his charge to the jury, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Webster charge&quot;, Shaw reviewed and/or refuted portions of the testimony heard and, in turn, defined murder, manslaughter, circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt. Chase notes that regarding Shaw&#x27;s review of the evidence presented that &quot;it must be remembered that at the time when this case was tried there was no statute forbidding the court to charge upon the facts. It was within the power of the court at that time, as it is not now, to express an opinion as to the weight of evidence.&quot;
Shaw&#x27;s charge to the jury was something less than unanimously well received in 1850. One pamphleteer at the time, identifying himself only as a &quot;Member of the Legal Profession&quot; wrote:

It seems scarcely credible that Judge Shaw could have given utterance to the language published in his &quot;charge to the jury.&quot; From the beginning to the end it is but an argument against the prisoner. An argument with all the moral force of a dictation to the jury, a dictation which makes a pretended trial by twelve men a mockery and a farce. ... What ulterior purpose was to be accomplished or what feeling of interest or resentment was to be gratified by such an extraordinary judicial usurpation as this we do not pretend even to conjecture; but we do not hesitate to declare that to find a parallel for such an unscrupulous prostitution of dignity, such an unblushing betrayal of the judicial office, we must go back to the days of Jeffreys.

The definition of murder as stated by Shaw was &quot;the killing of any person in the peace of the Commonwealth, with malice aforethought, either express or implied by law.&quot; Malice, as defined by the Chief Justice, included &quot;not only anger, hatred and revenge, but every other unlawful and unjustifiable motive.&quot; Manslaughter was defined by Shaw as &quot;the unlawful killing of another without malice&quot;. The distinction, as Leonard Williams Levy notes, is &quot;..no small matter, particularly to the accused whose life is at stake. The existence of malice distinguishes murder from manslaughter, and manslaughter, the unlawful killing of a human being without malice, does not carry the death penalty.&quot;

Having made the distinction in the law between murder and manslaughter, Shaw then argued, &quot;Upon this subject, the rule as deduced from the authorities is, that the implication of malice arises in every case of intentional homicide; and, the fact of killing being first proved, all the circumstances of accident, necessity, or infirmity, are to be satisfactorily established by the party charged, unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him to prove the homicide, and the circumstances attending it.&quot; While this would appear to be contrary to the principle of &quot;innocent until proven guilty,&quot; Shaw&#x27;s charge to the jury has been interpreted to mean that if the prosecution&#x27;s evidence proves that a life was taken and does not produce any evidence of extenuating circumstances, the law will imply that malice existed. It then, and only then, becomes the defense&#x27;s burden to show extenuating circumstances.
In 1850, the law required the prosecution to prove the existence of a crime, that is, the corpus delicti. In murder cases this had generally meant that the prosecution had to physically produce the corpse of the person alleged to have been murdered. In that only body parts and some teeth had been found, Shaw stated,

This case is to be proved, if proved at all, by circumstantial evidence; because it is not suggested that any direct evidence can be given, or that any witness can be called to give direct testimony upon the main fact of the killing. It becomes important, therefore, to state what circumstantial evidence is; to point out the distinction between that and positive or direct evidence; and to give you some idea of the mode in which a judicial investigation is to be pursued by the aid of circumstantial evidence. The distinction, then, between direct and circumstantial evidence, is this. Direct or positive evidence is when a witness can be called to testify to the precise fact which is the subject of the issue in trial; that is, in a case of homicide, that the party accused did cause the death of the deceased. Whatever may be the kind or force of the evidence, this is the fact to be proved. ... Circumstantial evidence, therefore, is founded on experience and observed facts and coincidences, establishing a connection between the known and proved facts and the fact sought to be proved. The advantages are, that, as the evidence commonly comes from several witnesses and different sources, a chain of circumstances is less likely to be falsely prepared and arranged, and falsehood and perjury are more likely to be detected and fail of their purpose.

Shaw further stated:

The evidence must establish the corpus delicti, as it is termed, or the offence committed as charged; and, in case of homicide, must not only prove a death by violence, but must, to a reasonable extent, exclude the hypothesis of suicide, and a death by the act of any other person. This is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Then, what is reasonable doubt? It is a term often used, probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined. It is not mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs and depending on moral evidence is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case, which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge. The burden of proof is upon the prosecutor.

Sullivan makes the case in his book that Shaw overstepped his judicial bounds in his charge to the jury. Sullivan cites &quot;Starkie, McNally, and Roscoe, the leading authorities upon the law of criminal evidence in 1850&quot; and notes that they &quot;made it quite clear that the fact of the corpus delicti, or the commission of the homicide, had to be proven by direct evidence to an absolute certainty, or beyond the least doubt. After this had been established absolutely, then the burden of proof was on the prosecution to show that the defendant had committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;

&quot;In his charge, however,&quot; Sullivan notes that &quot;Shaw set a new standard for the degree of proof required to show the commission of the homicide. He stated that the corpus delicti was to be proved &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; only, and then the guilt of the accused &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; also. He further instructed the jury that the corpus delicti could be established beyond a reasonable doubt by circumstantial evidence alone.&quot; The case against Webster was one of the first capital cases to be won by the prosecution without absolute evidence that the victim had been murdered.

===Other noted cases===
*The trial of anti-Catholic rioters who destroyed the Ursuline convent in Charlestown in &quot;Commonwealth v. Buzzell&quot; (1834).
*In &quot;Farwell v. Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad Corp.&quot; (1842), Shaw created the &quot;fellow servant&quot; rule, using contract rationale to prevent a railroad laborer from recovering from his employer. Shaw held that the laborer was at liberty to prevent his injury and for the corporation to insure against it would create a moral hazard problem. The decision empowered both the railroad industry and the insurance industry, which now had a market for insuring against workplace injuries.
*In &quot;Commonwealth v. Hunt&quot; (1842), Shaw provided an important precedent in labor relations by arguing that members of labor unions were not engaging in criminal conspiracies against their employers. 
*In &quot;Cary v. Daniels&quot;, 8 Metcalf (1844), Shaw created an important legal precedent in Massachusetts regarding the regulation of water power rights belonging to riparian proprietors.
*In &quot;Cobb v. Cobb&quot; (1847), Shaw presided over the unsuccessful divorce case of Henry Cobb against his wife Augusta Adams Cobb, for joining the Mormons and eventually marrying Brigham Young in a polygamous marriage.
*In &quot;Commonwealth v. Goode&quot; (1849), Shaw presided over the trial of Washington Goode, a black seaman convicted and executed on circumstantial evidence of murdering a fellow black mariner.
* In &quot;Brown v. Kendall&quot; (1850), Shaw established negligence as the dominant standard of &quot;tort&quot; law, and ruled that injured plaintiffs have the burden of proving that the defendant was negligent.
* Shaw&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Commonwealth v. Alger&quot; (1851) was an early and influential attempt to define the limits of state police power.

==Personal life==
On January 6, 1818, Shaw married Elizabeth Knapp, daughter of Josiah Knapp of Boston. She died in 1822, leaving a son and a daughter, Elizabeth, who became the wife of author Herman Melville. He was the nephew of Shaw&#x27;s former fiancée. In 1847, the year of his marriage to Elizabeth, Melville dedicated his Polynesian novel, &quot;Typee&quot;, to Lemuel Shaw. Shaw also may have been the model for Captain Vere in &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor (An Inside Narrative)&quot;, due to his unflinching application of the harsh fugitive slave law.

On August 29, 1827, Shaw married Hope Savage, daughter of Dr. Samuel Savage of Barnstable; they had two sons.

Widely read in English literature, Shaw was also attracted by new mechanical processes and was a member of many learned and charitable societies. He was a fellow of Harvard College from 1834 until his death, and an overseer from 1831 to 1853, two offices rarely united.

Shaw was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.

==Resignation and death==
After his resignation from the bench in 1860, his health failed, and he died within a few months. He was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery.

<text>Mike&#x27;s Murder is the 1983 motion picture soundtrack album from the film of the same name starring Debra Winger and written and directed by James Bridges. The album features original music by Joe Jackson. It is his sixth album.

==Description==
When Jackson was asked to compose a song for the film, he composed several pieces that were released as an album in September 1983. The film was eventually scored by John Barry, with little of Jackson&#x27;s music retained. The album reached the Top 100 in the United States, and the songs &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Breakdown&quot;, another song from the album, was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Instrumental Performance category.

The &quot;Mike&#x27;s Murder&quot; soundtrack was first released on CD, in its entirety, as part of the three-disc &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; in 2003, and separately released on CD in 2006 on the Lilith label. The album&#x27;s first five tracks were also included on the 2003 deluxe edition reissue of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; album.

In June 2009, Prometheus Records released a CD of John Barry&#x27;s replacement soundtrack, containing the entire score.

<text>Accepted Frewen (baptised 26 May 1588 – 28 March 1664) was a priest in the Church of England and Archbishop of York from 1660 to 1664.

==Life==
Frewen was born at Northiam, in east Sussex, the son of John Frewen who was the rector there. The unusual forename is an example of the type of puritan name not uncommon in the area in the late sixteenth century; his brother was called Thankful Frewen. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became a Fellow in 1612. Anthony Wood describes him as being at that time &quot;puritanically enclin&#x27;d&quot;. In 1617 and 1621 the college allowed him to act as chaplain to Sir John Digby, ambassador in Spain. In Madrid he preached a sermon that pleased Prince Charles, afterwards Charles I, who, on his accession, appointed him one of his chaplains.

In 1625 he became canon of Canterbury Cathedral and Vice-President of Magdalen College, and in the following year he was elected president. He was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1628 and 1629, and again in 1638 and 1639. In 1631 he was appointed (additionally) Dean of Gloucester. It was mainly by his instrumentality that the University plate was sent to the king at York in 1642.

Two years later (in 1644) he was consecrated Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and resigned his presidency (and deanery). He was deprived of his See by Parliament on 9 October 1646, as episcopacy was abolished for the duration of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate. Parliament declared his estates forfeited for treason in 1652, and Cromwell afterwards set a price on his head. The proclamations, however, designated him Stephen Frewen, and he was consequently able to escape into France. At the Restoration in 1660, he was restored to the See of Lichfield and Coventry, reappeared in public, and later the same year was elected Archbishop of York; he took that see by the confirmation of his election on 4 October 1660. In 1661 he acted as chairman of the Savoy conference.

<text>Internet Haganah is a &quot;global intelligence network dedicated to confronting Internet activities by Islamists and their supporters, enablers and apologists.&quot;

Internet Haganah also is an activist organization which attempts to convince businesses not to provide web-based services to such groups, and collects intelligence to store and pass on to government organizations. It was formed by Aaron Weisburd, an American computer programmer from Illinois, in 2002, and became part of a collection of private anti-terrorist web monitoring companies, including &quot;Terrorism Research Center&quot;, &quot;Search for International Terrorist Entities Institute&quot;, and &quot;Northeast Intelligence Network&quot;. Weisburd is the only full-time employee of Internet Haganah, which is run primarily from his home office, with the help of many online associates.

== The organization ==
&quot;Haganah&quot; is a Hebrew word meaning &#x27;defense&#x27;. Haganah is also the name of the early Zionist militia originally formed to defend Jewish settlers in British Mandate Palestine, and which evolved into what is now the Israel Defense Forces.

There are two main parts to Internet Haganah:

# A small, global band of researchers, consultants, analysts and translators, who &quot;associate and collaborate with each other as necessitated by our common desire to do more than just watch Islamists as they use the Internet. We [Internet Haganah] share an understanding that a jihad, or holy war, has been declared against the West, and these jihadists need to be met on whatever field of battle they may appear.&quot;
# The parent organization is The Society for Internet Research.

== Operation ==
The organization says it has taken down more than 1,000 Jihad sites. Their success logo is a blue drawing of an AK-47.

To target websites perceived as threats, the organization relies upon its web community to find jihadists, and use a free &quot;whois&quot; service to determine if a US-based server hosts them. If so, as in the case of mawusat.com and its host Go Daddy, Internet Haganah operatives express concern about the nature of the site and ask the host to remove it. If this does not work and if the site concerns the US State Department&#x27;s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, or the US Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Asset Control&#x27;s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, Internet Haganah contacts the banks and financiers of the host, who could face serious penalties for engaging in unreported transactions with the suspect website. If all else fails, the media may be contacted.

However, their targets often find countermeasures against these actions. In the case of GoDaddy.com and mawusat.com, the site was attacked, but appeared on a different server within a week. Newsweek reported:

It’s no coincidence, they argue, that in just the past year, Islamists have gotten savvier in their use of the Internet. In early 2004, Iraqi insurgent Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi and his group posted the video of the execution of Nicholas Berg, an American contractor working in Iraq, to one Web site, which was quickly overwhelmed with traffic. Today, jihadis post evidence of their operations on dozens of sites and coordinate their operations on secret e-mail lists, password-protected Web sites and audio chat services like PalTalk, which don’t leave behind a printed record. “The level of sophistication of these groups has become just unbelievable,”says Rita Katz, who monitors Islamic Internet activities as director of the D.C.-based Site Institute. – Stone, Brad (July 13, 2005.)

== Founder ==
A. Aaron Weisburd is a &quot;half-Irish, half-Jewish New Yorker&quot; in Carbondale, Illinois. He was a philosophy major at George Washington University. He is the founder and Director of Internet Haganah, and also of the Society for Internet Research.

== Press coverage ==
Internet Haganah has received press coverage from such publications as &quot;Wired News&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. A profile of Internet Haganah and their conflict with Islamist hacker Irhabi 007 was featured in the July/August 2006 of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Haganah has also been reported on by a Hamas newspaper.

Internet Haganah was identified by Media Matters for America as one of the sources to use the term &quot;Obama Intifada&quot;, a term critical of U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s policies on Israel.

<doc id="1165171" wikidata="Q2642734" url="?curid=1165171" title="Alexander Nehamas">
<text>Alexander Nehamas (; born 22 March 1946) is a Greek-born American philosopher. He is a professor of philosophy and comparative literature and the Edmund N. Carpenter II Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University, where he has taught since 1990. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences and Member of the American Philosophical Society (since 2016), the Academy of Athens since 2018. He works on Greek philosophy, aesthetics, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and literary theory.

== Biography ==

Nehamas was born in Athens, Greece in 1946. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1967 and completed his doctorate (titled &quot;Predication and the Theory of Forms in the&quot; Phaedo) under the direction of Gregory Vlastos at Princeton University in 1971. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990.

== Philosophical work ==

His early work was on Platonic metaphysics and aesthetics as well as the philosophy of Socrates, but he gained a wider audience with his 1985 book &quot;Nietzsche: Life as Literature&quot; (Harvard University Press), in which he argued that Nietzsche thought of life and the world on the model of a literary text. Nehamas has said, &quot;The virtues of life are comparable to the virtues of good writing—style, connectedness, grace, elegance—and also, we must not forget, sometimes getting it right.&quot; More recently, he has become well known for his view that philosophy should provide a form of life, as well as for his endorsement of the artistic value of television. This view also becomes evident in his book &quot;Only a Promise of Happiness&quot;. The title itself is later in this work used as one definition of beauty with reference to Stendhal. In that sense, beauty can be found in all media; as Nehamas claims in the same work: &quot;Aesthetic features are everywhere, but that has nothing to do with where the arts can be found. Works of art can be beautiful because everything can be beautiful, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that anything can be a work of art.&quot;

In 2016, Nehamas published a book, &quot;On Friendship&quot;, based on his 2008 Gifford Lectures. In it, he argues, contra Aristotle, that friendship is an aesthetic, but not always moral or good. In a manner similar to his earlier work, &quot;Only a Promise of Happiness&quot;, Nehamas compares the relationship of an individual to friends as having similarities to the relationship which an individual can have to artworks. “Like metaphors and works of art, the people who matter to us are all, so far as we are concerned, inexhaustible. They always remain a step beyond the furthest point our knowledge of them has reached—though only if, and as long as, they still matter to us.”

<text>Brevet Lieutenant Colonel John Marshall Gamble (1791 – 11 September 1836) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps during the early 19th century. He was the first, and remains the only known, U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship, commanding the prize ships &quot;Greenwich&quot; and during naval actions in the Pacific during the War of 1812.

==Biography==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Gamble was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 16 January 1809 at the age of 17.

Stationed in the South Sea in the Marine Detachment aboard the frigate USS &quot;Essex&quot; during the War of 1812, he rose to the rank of captain by June 1814. He distinguished himself in many enterprises, including encounters with people of the Marquesas Islands during the absence of USS &quot;Essex&quot; in 1813, and sailing a prize of &quot;Essex&quot;, the former whaler , with only a four-man crew and without benefit of a chart in a 17-day voyage to the Hawaiian Islands.

Lieutenant Colonel Gamble is chiefly remembered in history as the only U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship, commanding two separate prize ships, the USS &quot;Greenwich&quot; and USS &quot;Sir Andrew Hammond&quot;, during the War of 1812: &quot;...and, for want of sea officers, I placed Lieutenant Gamble of the Marines in charge of the Greenwich.&quot;

On or about 13 July 1813, while commanding the &quot;Greenwich&quot;, Lieutenant Gamble&#x27;s capture of the British armed whaler after a sharp engagement was noted as a triumph by American newspapers and thus earned him considerable fame upon his return. &quot;Seringapatam&quot; was deemed the biggest British threat to American whalers in the South Pacific at the time.

On 14 July 1813, Commodore Porter wrote of Lieutenant Gamble:

&quot;Allow me to return to you my thanks for your handsome conduct in bringing the Seringapatam to action, which greatly facilitated her capture, while it prevented the possibility of her escape. Be assured, sir, I shall make a suitable representation of the affair to the honorable Secretary of the Navy.&quot;

Later, Commodore Porter wrote a further communication to the Navy Department:

&quot;Captain Gamble at all times greatly distinguished himself by his activity in every enterprise engaged in by the force under my command, and in many critical encounters by the natives of Madison Island, rendered essential services, and at all times distinguished himself by his coolness and bravery. I therefore do, with pleasure, recommend him to the Department as an officer deserving of its patronage.&quot;

And again he wrote:

&quot;I now avail myself of the opportunity of assuring you that no Marine officer in the service ever had such strong claims as Captain Gamble, and that none have been placed in such conspicuous and critical situations, and that none could have extricated themselves from them more to their honor.&quot;

Porter&#x27;s later decision to burn the &quot;Greenwich&quot; at Nuku Hiva also served to deprive the British of the valuable whale oil, then badly needed in England. However, during the Nuku Hiva Campaign, Lieutenant Gamble was again ordered by Commodore Porter to assume command of a prize ship, the &quot;Sir Andrew Hammond&quot;, and after the &quot;Seringapatam Mutiny&quot;, where the British prisoners successfully regained control over the &quot;Seringapatam&quot; and sailed to Australia, Gamble set out to sail the &quot;Sir Andrew Hammond&quot; with a skeleton crew to the Leeward Islands, but was intercepted en route.

Gamble&#x27;s subsequent capture by the British sloop , also served to protect the American whaling efforts in the region. Aboard &quot;Sir Andrew Hammond&quot;, Gamble was carrying gifts to be delivered as a tribute to the King of the Leeward Islands. When these were taken by Captain Tucker of the &quot;Cherub&quot; as prizes of war, the diplomatic relations between the British and King of the Leeward Islands deteriorated.

When American whalers were seen in the harbor, Captain Tucker demanded the native king turn both whalers and the stockpiled whale oil over to him. Tucker went so far as to threaten the King by landing his Royal Marines to change the King&#x27;s mind. The good king firmly said, &quot;No.&quot; Tucker decided that a sloop&#x27;s small complement of Marines and available firepower would be insufficient to force the issue, and thus sailed away.

While promoted to his substantial majority only in July 1834—a full 21 years after his most famous action with the &quot;Seringapatam&quot;—Gamble was breveted a lieutenant colonel on 3 March 1827, which rank he held until his death.

He died in New York City on 11 September 1836.

<text>Admiral Francis Munroe Ramsay (April 5, 1835 – July 19, 1914) was an officer in the United States Navy who distinguished himself in the American Civil War, and who later served as Chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Navigation.

==Early life and career==
Born in the District of Columbia, Ramsay was appointed midshipman on October 5, 1850. After training in and in , he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1856. He subsequently served in with the Brazil Squadron; in with the Pacific Squadron; on ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard; and in when working with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Africa.

==Civil War service==
On March 23, 1863, he assumed command of , for duty in the Mississippi Squadron. In that gunboat, he participated in Yazoo River operations during April and May. Then on June 7, he supported a Union garrison at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, Louisiana in holding off some 4,000 Confederate troops. Moving on to Vicksburg, he commanded a battery of heavy guns mounted on scows in exposed positions before the city, June 19 – July 4. After the capture of the river stronghold, he was given command of the 3d Division, Mississippi Squadron.

During February and March 1864, he led expeditions up the Black and Ouachita Rivers and from mid-March to early May participated in Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter&#x27;s expedition up the Red River. On September 28, he was transferred to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in command of .

He participated in the amphibious assaults on Fort Fisher December 24, 1864 and on January 13, 1865, and in subsequent attacks against Fort Anderson and other forts along the Cape Fear River. In April, he assisted in removing torpedoes (mines) from the James River and was present at the capture of Richmond.

==Post-Civil War service==
After the Civil War, Ramsay served in many and varied positions afloat; as Fleet Captain, South Atlantic Squadron and as commanding officer of , , , , and . Ashore, he served at the Naval Academy, at Newport, in London as naval attaché, and at Boston and New York as commandant of the Navy Yards. In 1889 he became Chief of the Bureau of Navigation and remained in that post until his retirement April 5, 1897.

He was promoted to rear admiral on April 5, 1894, and died in Washington, D.C. July 19, 1914.

==Legacy==
In 1918, the destroyer was named in his honor.

<doc id="1165182" wikidata="Q1892897" url="?curid=1165182" title="Torus knot">
<text>In knot theory, a torus knot is a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R3. Similarly, a torus link is a link which lies on the surface of a torus in the same way. Each torus knot is specified by a pair of coprime integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. A torus link arises if &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are not coprime (in which case the number of components is gcd(&quot;p, q&quot;)). A torus knot is trivial (equivalent to the unknot) if and only if either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; is equal to 1 or −1. The simplest nontrivial example is the (2,3)-torus knot, also known as the trefoil knot.

== Geometrical representation ==

A torus knot can be rendered geometrically in multiple ways which are topologically equivalent (see Properties below) but geometrically distinct. The convention used in this article and its figures is the following.

The (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-torus knot winds &quot;q&quot; times around a circle in the interior of the torus, and &quot;p&quot; times around its axis of rotational symmetry.. If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are not relatively prime, then we have a torus link with more than one component.

The direction in which the strands of the knot wrap around the torus is also subject to differing conventions. The most common is to have the strands form a right-handed screw for &quot;p q &gt; 0&quot;.

The (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-torus knot can be given by the parametrization
:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3. This lies on the surface of the torus given by formula_4 (in cylindrical coordinates).

Other parameterizations are also possible, because knots are defined up to continuous deformation. The illustrations for the (2,3)- and (3,8)-torus knots can be obtained by taking formula_5, and in the case of the (2,3)-torus knot by furthermore subtracting respectively formula_6 and formula_7 from the above parameterizations of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The latter generalizes smoothly to any coprime &quot;p,q&quot; satisfying formula_8.

==Properties==
A torus knot is trivial iff either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; is equal to 1 or −1.

Each nontrivial torus knot is prime and chiral.

The (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) torus knot is equivalent to the (&quot;q&quot;,&quot;p&quot;) torus knot. This can be proved by moving the strands on the surface of the torus. The (&quot;p&quot;,−&quot;q&quot;) torus knot is the obverse (mirror image) of the (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) torus knot. The (−&quot;p&quot;,−&quot;q&quot;) torus knot is equivalent to the (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) torus knot except for the reversed orientation.
Any (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-torus knot can be made from a closed braid with &quot;p&quot; strands. The appropriate braid word is

(This formula assumes the common convention that braid generators are right twists, which is not followed by the Wikipedia page on braids.)

The crossing number of a (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) torus knot with &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; &gt; 0 is given by
:&quot;c&quot; = min((&quot;p&quot;−1)&quot;q&quot;, (&quot;q&quot;−1)&quot;p&quot;).
The genus of a torus knot with &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; &gt; 0 is

The Jones polynomial of a (right-handed) torus knot is given by
:formula_13

The complement of a torus knot in the 3-sphere is a Seifert-fibered manifold, fibred over the disc with two singular fibres.

Let &quot;Y&quot; be the &quot;p&quot;-fold dunce cap with a disk removed from the interior, &quot;Z&quot; be the &quot;q&quot;-fold dunce cap with a disk removed from its interior, and &quot;X&quot; be the quotient space obtained by identifying &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; along their boundary circle. The knot complement of the (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) -torus knot deformation retracts to the space &quot;X&quot;. Therefore, the knot group of a torus knot has the presentation

:formula_14

Torus knots are the only knots whose knot groups have nontrivial center (which is infinite cyclic, generated by the element formula_15 in the presentation above).

The stretch factor of the (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) torus knot, as a curve in Euclidean space, is Ω(min(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)), so torus knots have unbounded stretch factors. Undergraduate researcher John Pardon won the 2012 Morgan Prize for his research proving this result, which solved a problem originally posed by Mikhail Gromov.

== Connection to complex hypersurfaces ==

The (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)−torus knots arise when considering the link of an isolated complex hypersurface singularity. One intersects the complex hypersurface with a hypersphere, centred at the isolated singular point, and with sufficiently small radius so that it does not enclose, nor encounter, any other singular points. The intersection gives a submanifold of the hypersphere.

Let &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; be coprime integers, greater than or equal to two. Consider the holomorphic function formula_16 given by formula_17 Let formula_18 be the set of formula_19 such that formula_20 Given a real number formula_21 we define the real three-sphere formula_22 as given by formula_23 The function formula_24 has an isolated critical point at formula_25 since formula_26 if and only if formula_27 Thus, we consider the structure of formula_28 close to formula_29 In order to do this, we consider the intersection formula_30 This intersection is the so-called link of the singularity formula_31 The link of formula_32, where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are coprime, and both greater than or equal to two, is exactly the (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)−torus knot.

==&quot;g&quot;-torus knot==
A g-torus knot is a closed curve drawn on a g-torus. More technically, it is the homeomorphic image of a circle in S³ which can be realized as a subset of a genus &quot;g&quot; handlebody in S³ (whose complement is also a genus &quot;g&quot; handlebody). If a link is a subset of a genus two handlebody, it is a double torus link.

For genus two, the simplest example of a double torus knot that is not a torus knot is the figure-eight knot.

<text>Myron Lavell Avant (born April 26, 1978), mononymously known as Avant, is an American R&amp;B singer. He is known for his songs &quot;Separated&quot;, &quot;Read Your Mind&quot;, and &quot;Makin&#x27; Good Love&quot;. He has produced three Platinum-selling albums. He has released 15 singles and 9 albums.

== Early life and education ==
Avant was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of five siblings. He did not belong to a wealthy family and grew up watching his mother struggle to provide the best to her children. His mother encouraged him to improve his music skills by playing classic R&amp;B artists like Smokey Robinson, The Supremes, and Marvin Gaye. He was passionate about music since his childhood. He pursued acting during his high school education at Cleveland School of the Arts. After graduating from high school, he worked a few factory jobs.

==Career==
Avant began writing songs at the age of 14. He independently released his debut single &quot;Separated&quot; in 2000. It was a song based on a failed romantic relationship. The single created a buzz and was played on the radio. It helped him land a deal at Magic Johnson Music. In 2000, he released his debut album, &quot;My Thoughts&quot;, which sold more than 1.3 million copies in the United States and 4.4 million worldwide. It was released by MCA Records. His debut album featured a remake with fellow R&amp;B singer Keke Wyatt of the 1983 René &amp; Angela ballad &quot;My First Love&quot;. It reached the top 5 of the R&amp;B chart and helped boost Wyatt&#x27;s career. He released his second album, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, in 2002. It featured another of his top ten hits, &quot;Makin&#x27; Good Love&quot;. His third album, &quot;Private Room&quot;, was released in 2003, and reached number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. A track from the album, &quot;Read Your Mind&quot;, was ranked 13th on the Hot 100. A remix featuring Snoop Dogg appeared on the promotional vinyl and was released on September 30, 2003. In 2005, Avant featured on Cuban Link&#x27;s song &quot;Comin&#x27; Home With Me&quot; alongside Swizz Beatz, which was included on the album Chain Reaction.

In 2006, Avant released his fourth album &quot;Director&quot;, which topped the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its lead single, &quot;When It Hurts&quot;, reached number 91 on the Hot 100.

Avant was featured in the remix of Lloyd Banks&#x27; song &quot;Karma&quot; from the 2004 album &quot;The Hunger for More&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 feature film &quot;BarberShop 2: Back in Business&quot;.

In 2009, Avant collaborated with Maze on a cover of &quot;Joy and Pain&quot; as a tribute to the band for an album called &quot;Silky Soul Music: An All Star Tribute to Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly&quot;.

His self-titled fifth album, &quot;Avant&quot;, was released on December 9, 2008. Avant later signed to Verve Forecast and released his sixth studio album &quot;The Letter&quot; (formerly titled &quot;Wake Up&quot;) on December 21, 2010, featuring production from the likes of The Pentagon; Mike City; Marshall Leathers; and Kajun. His eighth album &quot;The VIII&quot; was released on September 25, 2015.

In 2019, Avant returned with the single &quot;Not Gone Lose&quot; and signed a label deal to release the album &quot;Can We Fall in Love&quot;, which was released in July 2020.

==Influences==
Although successful, Avant began drawing comparisons to fellow R&amp;B singer R. Kelly and even faced some backlash from music critics.

Avant has cited Kelly as his biggest influence and inspiration. &quot;Being compared to R. Kelly is a compliment in itself. He&#x27;s been in the game for about twelve years. He is Mr. R&amp;B. To be in the game, and to be named in the same sentence as that man is truly a privilege&quot;, Avant said.

== Personal life ==
Avant suffers from lupus and has taken up a vegan diet to help manage its effects.

<text>Russell Amos Kirk (October 19, 1918 – April 29, 1994) was an American political philosopher, moralist, historian, social critic, literary critic, and author, known for his influence on 20th-century American conservatism. His 1953 book &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot; gave shape to the postwar conservative movement in the U.S. It traced the development of conservative thought in the Anglo-American tradition, giving special importance to the ideas of Edmund Burke. Kirk was considered the chief proponent of traditionalist conservatism. 
He was also an accomplished author of Gothic and ghost story fiction. He is often considered one of the most significant conservative men of letters of the twentieth century.

== Biography ==
Russell Kirk was born in Plymouth, Michigan. He was the son of Russell Andrew Kirk, a railroad engineer, and Marjorie Pierce Kirk. Kirk obtained his B.A. at Michigan State University and a M.A. at Duke University. During World War II, he served in the American armed forces and corresponded with a libertarian writer, Isabel Paterson, who helped to shape his early political thought. After reading Albert Jay Nock&#x27;s book, &quot;Our Enemy, the State&quot;, he engaged in a similar correspondence with him. After the war, he attended the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In 1953, he became the only American to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters by that university.

Kirk &quot;laid out a post-World War II program for conservatives by warning them, &#x27;A handful of individuals, some of them quite unused to moral responsibilities on such a scale, made it their business to extirpate the populations of Nagasaki and Hiroshima; we must make it our business to curtail the possibility of such snap decisions.&#x27;&quot;

Upon completing his studies, Kirk took up an academic position at his alma mater, Michigan State. He resigned in 1959, after having become disenchanted with the rapid growth in student number and emphasis on intercollegiate athletics and technical training at the expense of the traditional liberal arts. Thereafter he referred to Michigan State as &quot;Cow College&quot; or &quot;Behemoth University.&quot; He later wrote that academic political scientists and sociologists were &quot;as a breed—dull dogs&quot;. Late in life, he taught one semester a year at Hillsdale College, where he was distinguished visiting professor of humanities.

Kirk frequently published in two American conservative journals he helped found, &quot;National Review&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Modern Age&quot; in 1957. He was the founding editor of the latter, 1957–59. He was later made a Distinguished Fellow of The Heritage Foundation, where he gave a number of lectures.

After leaving Michigan State, Kirk returned to his ancestral home in Mecosta, Michigan, where he wrote the many books, academic articles, lectures, and the syndicated newspaper column (which ran for 13 years) by which he exerted his influence on American politics and intellectual life. In 1963, Kirk converted to Catholicism and married Annette Courtemanche; they had four daughters. She and Kirk became known for their hospitality, welcoming many political, philosophical, and literary figures in their Mecosta house (known as &quot;Piety Hill&quot;), and giving shelter to political refugees, hoboes, and others. Their home became the site of a sort of seminar on conservative thought for university students. Piety Hill now houses the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal. After his conversion to Catholicism Kirk was a founding board member of Una Voce America.

Kirk declined to drive, calling cars &quot;mechanical Jacobins&quot;, and would have nothing to do with television and what he called &quot;electronic computers&quot;.

Kirk did not always maintain a stereotypically &quot;conservative&quot; voting record. In the 1944 presidential election, Kirk voted for Norman Thomas, the candidate for the Socialist Party, rather than choose between incumbent Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey. In the 1976 presidential election, he voted for Eugene McCarthy. In 1992 he supported Pat Buchanan&#x27;s primary challenge to incumbent George H. W. Bush, serving as state chair of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan.

Kirk was a contributor to &quot;Chronicles&quot;. In 1989, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Ronald Reagan.

On April 29, 1994, Kirk died from heart failure at the age of 75, at his home in Mecosta, Michigan.

== Political philosophy ==
=== &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot; ===
&quot;The Conservative Mind&quot;, the published version of Kirk&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, contributed materially to the 20th century Burke revival. It also drew attention to:
* Conservative statesmen such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Fisher Ames, George Canning, John C. Calhoun, John Randolph of Roanoke, Joseph de Maistre, Benjamin Disraeli, and Arthur Balfour;
* The conservative implications of writings by well-known authors such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott, Alexis de Tocqueville, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Russell Lowell, George Gissing, George Santayana, Robert Frost, and T. S. Eliot;
* British and American authors such as Fisher Ames, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, John Henry Newman, Walter Bagehot, Henry James Sumner Maine, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, Edwin Lawrence Godkin, William Hurrell Mallock, Leslie Stephen, Albert Venn Dicey, Robert Nisbet, Paul Elmer More, and Irving Babbitt.
&quot;The Portable Conservative Reader&quot; (1982), which Kirk edited, contains sample writings by most of the above.

Biographer Bradley J. Birzer argues that for all his importance in inspiring the modern conservative movement, not many of his followers agreed with his unusual approach to the history of conservatism. As summarized by reviewer Drew Maciag:
:As Birzer&#x27;s study demonstrates, Kirk&#x27;s understanding of conservatism was so unique, idiosyncratic, transcendental, elitist, and in certain respects premodern and European, that it bore little resemblance to political conservatism in the United States. &quot;Conservative Mind&quot; successfully launched an intellectual challenge to postwar liberalism, but the variety of conservatism Kirk preferred found few takers, even within the American Right.

Harry Jaffa (a student of Leo Strauss) wrote: &quot;Kirk was a poor Burke scholar. Burke&#x27;s attack on metaphysical reasoning related only to modern philosophy&#x27;s attempt to eliminate skeptical doubt from its premises and hence from its conclusions.&quot;

Gerald J. Russello argues that Kirk adapted what 19th-century American Catholic thinker Orestes Brownson called &quot;territorial democracy&quot; to articulate a version of federalism that was based on premises that differ in part from those of the founders and other conservatives. Kirk further believed that territorial democracy could reconcile the tension between treating the states as mere provinces of the central government, and as autonomous political units independent of Washington. Finally, territorial democracy allowed Kirk to set out a theory of individual rights grounded in the particular historical circumstances of the United States, while rejecting a universal conception of such rights.

In addition to bringing public attention to Anglo-American conservative principles, Kirk described his perception of liberal ideals in the first chapter. Kirk identified these ideals as the perfectibility of man, hostility towards tradition, rapid change in economic and political systems, and the secularization of government.

=== Principles ===
Kirk developed six &quot;canons&quot; of conservatism, which Gerald J. Russello described as follows:
# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, divine revelation, or natural law;
# An affection for the &quot;variety and mystery&quot; of human existence;
# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize &quot;natural&quot; distinctions;
# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked;
# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription, and
# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.

Kirk said that Christianity and Western Civilization are &quot;unimaginable apart from one another&quot; and that &quot;all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief.&quot;

== Political views ==
=== Libertarianism ===

Kirk grounded his Burkean conservatism in tradition, political philosophy, &quot;belles lettres&quot;, and the strong religious faith of his later years, rather than libertarianism and free-market economic reasoning. &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot; hardly mentions economics at all.

In a polemic, Kirk, quoting T. S. Eliot&#x27;s expression, called libertarians &quot;chirping sectaries,&quot; adding that conservatives and libertarians share opposition to &quot;collectivism,&quot; &quot;the totalist state,&quot; and &quot;bureaucracy,&quot; but otherwise have &quot;nothing&quot; in common. He called the libertarian movement &quot;an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating.&quot; He said a line of division exists between believers in &quot;some sort of transcendent moral order&quot; and &quot;utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct.&quot; He included libertarians in the latter category. Kirk, therefore, questioned the &quot;fusionism&quot; between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States. Kirk also argued that libertarians &quot;bear no authority, temporal or spiritual&quot; and do not &quot;venerate ancient beliefs and customs, or the natural world, or [their] country, or the immortal spark in [their] fellow men.&quot;

However, Kirk&#x27;s view of classical liberals is positive. He agrees with them on &quot;ordered liberty&quot;, as they make &quot;common cause with regular conservatives against the menace of democratic despotism and economic collectivism.&quot;

Tibor R. Machan defended libertarianism in response to Kirk&#x27;s original Heritage Lecture. Machan argued that the right of individual sovereignty is perhaps most worthy of conserving from the American political heritage, and that when conservatives themselves talk about preserving some tradition, they cannot at the same time claim a disrespectful distrust of the individual human mind, of rationalism itself.

Jacob G. Hornberger of the Future of Freedom Foundation also responded to Kirk.

=== South Africa ===
In a column in &quot;The National Review&quot; on March 9, 1965, entitled &quot;&#x27;One Man, One Vote&#x27; in South Africa,&quot; Kirk wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisprudence on voting &quot;will work mischief—much injuring, rather than fulfilling, the responsible democracy for which Tocqueville hoped,&quot; but in the case of South Africa &quot;this degradation of the democratic dogma, if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization.&quot; Kirk wrote that &quot;the &#x27;European&#x27; element [makes] South Africa the only &#x27;modern&#x27; and prosperous African country.&quot; He added that &quot;Bantu political domination [of South Africa] would be domination by witch doctors (still numerous and powerful) and reckless demagogues&quot; and that &quot;Bantu and Coloreds and Indians must feel that they have some political voice in the South African commonwealth.&quot;

=== Neoconservatism ===
Late in life, Kirk grew disenchanted with American neoconservatives as well. As &quot;Chronicles&quot; editor Scott Richert describes it:
[One line] helped define the emerging struggle between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives. &quot;Not seldom has it seemed,&quot; Kirk declared, &quot;as if some eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States.&quot; A few years later, in another Heritage Foundation speech, Kirk repeated that line verbatim. In the wake of the Gulf War, which he had opposed, he clearly understood that those words carried even greater meaning.

Kirk also commented the neoconservatives were &quot;often clever...seldom wise.&quot;
Midge Decter, Jewish director of the Committee for the Free World, called Kirk&#x27;s remark &quot;a bloody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism by Kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives.&quot; She told &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s this notion of a Christian civilization. You have to be part of it or you&#x27;re not really fit to conserve anything. That&#x27;s an old line and it&#x27;s very ignorant.&quot;

Samuel T. Francis called Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Tel Aviv&quot; remark &quot;a wisecrack about the slavishly pro-Israel sympathies among neoconservatives.&quot; He described Decter&#x27;s response as untrue, &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;vitriolic.&quot; Furthermore, he argued that such a denunciation &quot;always plays into the hands of the left, which is then able to repeat the charges and claim conservative endorsement of them.

=== The Gulf War ===
Toward the end of his life, Kirk was highly critical of Republican militarism. President George H. W. Bush, Kirk said, had embarked upon &quot;a radical course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf.&quot;

Excerpts from Kirk&#x27;s lectures at The Heritage Foundation (1992):

== Other works ==
Kirk&#x27;s other important books include &quot;Eliot and his Age: T. S. Eliot&#x27;s Moral Imagination in the Twentieth Century&quot; (1972), &quot;The Roots of American Order&quot; (1974), and the autobiographical &quot;Sword of the Imagination: Memoirs of a Half Century of Literary Conflict&quot; (1995). As was the case with his hero Edmund Burke, Kirk became renowned for the prose style of his intellectual and polemical writings.

=== Fiction ===
Beyond his scholarly achievements, Kirk was talented both as an oral storyteller and as an author of genre fiction, most notably in his telling of consummate ghost stories in the classic tradition of Sheridan Le Fanu, M. R. James, Oliver Onions, and H. Russell Wakefield. He also wrote other admired and much-anthologized works that are variously classified as horror, fantasy, science fiction, and political satire. These earned him plaudits from fellow creative writers as varied and distinguished as T. S. Eliot, Robert Aickman, Madeleine L&#x27;Engle, and Ray Bradbury.

Though modest in quantity—it encompasses three novels and 22 short stories—Kirk&#x27;s body of fiction was written amid a busy career as prolific nonfiction writer, editor, and speaker. As with such other speculative fiction authors as G. K. Chesterton, C. S. Lewis, and J. R. R. Tolkien (all of whom likewise wrote only nonfiction for their &quot;day jobs&quot;), there are conservative undercurrents—social, cultural, religious, and political—to Kirk&#x27;s fiction. Kirk stated in 1984 that the purpose of his stories as: The political ferocity of our age is sufficiently dismaying: men of letters need not conjure up horrors worse than those suffered during the past decade by the Cambodians and Ugandans, Afghans and Ethiopians. What I have attempted, rather, are experiments in the moral imagination. Readers will encounter elements of parable and fable...some clear premise is about the character of human existence...a healthy concept of the character of evil...

His first novel, &quot;Old House of Fear&quot; (1961, 1965), as with so many of his short stories, was written in a self-consciously Gothic vein. Here the plot is concerned with an American assigned by his employer to a bleak locale in rural Scotland—the same country where Kirk had attended graduate school. This was Kirk&#x27;s most commercially successful and critically acclaimed fictional work, doing much to sustain him financially in subsequent years. &quot;Old House of Fear&quot; was inspired by the novels of John Buchan and Kirk&#x27;s own Scottish heritage. The story of &quot;Old House of Fear&quot; concerns an young American, Hugh Logan, a World War II veteran who is both brave and sensitive, sent to buy Carnglass, a remote island in the Hebrides. Upon reaching the island, he discovers that the island&#x27;s owner, Lady MacAskival and her beautiful adopted daughter Mary are being held hostage by foreign spies, who are presumably working for the Soviet Union, out to sabotage a nearby NATO base. The leader of the spies is Dr. Jackman, an evil genius and nihilist intent upon wrecking a world that failed to acknowledge his greatness and whom reviewers noted was a much more vividly drawn character than the hero Logan. Dr. Jackman appears to be a prototype of Kirk&#x27;s best known character, Manfred Arcane, with the only difference being the former has no values while the latter does.

Later novels were &quot;A Creature of the Twilight&quot; (1966), a dark comedy satirizing postcolonial African politics; and &quot;Lord of the Hollow Dark&quot; (1979, 1989), set in Scotland, which explores the great evil inhabiting a haunted house. 
&quot;A Creature of the Twilight&quot; concerns the adventures in Africa of a reactionary, romantic mercenary Mandred Arcane, a self-proclaimed mixture of Machiavelli and Sir Lancelot, who is an anachronistic survival of the Victorian Age who does not belong in the modern world and yet defiantly still exists, making him the &quot;creature of the twilight&quot;. Kirk has Arcane write his pseudo-memoir in a consciously Victorian style to underline that he does not belong in the 1960s. Arcane is both a dapper intellectual and a hardened man of action, an elderly man full of an unnatural vigor, who is hired by the son of the assassinated Sultan to put down a Communist rebellion in the fictional African nation of Hamnegri, which he does despite overwhelming odds. In 1967, Kirk published a short story &quot;Belgrummo&#x27;s Hell&quot; about a clever art thief who unwisely tries to rob the estate of the ancient Scottish warlock, Lord Belgrummo, who is later revealed to be Arcane&#x27;s father. In another short story published in the same collection, &quot;The Peculiar Demesne of Archvicar Gerontion&quot; concerned a wizard, Archvicar Gerontion, who tries to kill Arcane by casting deadly spells.

The &quot;Lord of the Hollow Dark&quot; is set at the same Belgrummo estate first encountered in &quot;Belgrummo&#x27;s Hell&quot; where an evil cult led by the Aleister Crowley-like character Apollinax have assembled to secure for themselves the &quot;Timeless Moment&quot; of eternal sexual pleasure by sacrificing two innocents, an young woman named Marina and her infant daughter in an ancient warren called the Weem under the Belgrummo Estate. Assisting Apollinax is Archvicar Gerontion, who is really Arcane in disguise. Inspired by the novels of H.P. Lovecraft, Kirk in the &quot;Lord of the Hollow Dark&quot; has Arcane survive a &quot;horrid chthonian pilgrimage&quot; as he faces dark supernatural forces, confront his own family&#x27;s history of evil, and refuse the appeal of a &quot;seductive, hubristic immorality&quot;. The novel concludes with Arcane&#x27;s own definition of a true &quot;Timeless Moment&quot; which he states: &quot;it comes from faith, from hope, from charity; from having your work in the world; from the happiness of the people you love; or simply as a gift of grace&quot;. During his lifetime, Kirk also oversaw the publication of three collections which together encompassed all his short stories. (Three more such collections have been published posthumously, but those only reprint stories found in the earlier volumes. One such posthumous collection, &quot;Ancestral Shadows: An Anthology of Ghostly Tales&quot;, was edited by his student, friend, and collaborator Vigen Guroian, and includes both an essay by Kirk on &#x27;ghostly tales&#x27; and Guroian&#x27;s own analysis of the stories as well as Kirk&#x27;s motives in writing them.) Many of Kirk&#x27;s short stories, especially the ghost stories, were set in either Scotland or in the rural parts of his home state of Michigan.

Among his novels and stories, certain characters tend to recur, enriching the already considerable unity and resonance of his fictional canon. Though—through their themes and prose-style—Kirk&#x27;s fiction and nonfiction works are complementary, many readers of the one have not known of his work in the other.

Having begun to write fiction fairly early in his career, Kirk appears to have stopped after the early 1980s, while continuing his nonfiction writing and research through his last year of life. For a comprehensive bibliography of his fiction, see the fiction section of his bibliography.
