<text>Paul John Flory (June 19, 1910 – September 9, 1985) was an American chemist and Nobel laureate who was known for his work in the field of polymers, or macromolecules. He was a pioneer in understanding the behavior of polymers in solution, and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 &quot;for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules&quot;.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Flory was born in Sterling, Illinois, on June 19, 1910 to Ezra Flory and Martha Brumbaugh. His father worked as a clergyman-educator, and his mother was a school teacher. His ancestors were German Huguenots, who traced their roots back to Alsace. He first gained an interest in science from Carl W Holl, who was a chemistry professor at Manchester College. In 1936, he married Emily Catherine Tabor. They had three children together: Susan Springer, Melinda Groom and Paul John Flory, Jr. His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers. He was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2002. Flory died on September 9, 1985, following a heart attack. His wife Emily died in 2006 aged 94.

== Schooling ==
After graduating from Elgin High School in 1927, Flory received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Manchester College (now Manchester University (Indiana) in 1931 and a Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 1934. He completed a years of master&#x27;s study in organic chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Cecil E Boord, before moving into physical chemistry. Flory&#x27;s doctoral thesis was on the photochemistry of nitric oxide, supervised by Prof. Herrick L. Johnston.

== Work ==
In 1934 Flory joined the Central Department of Dupont and Company working with Wallace H. Carothers. After Carothers&#x27; death in 1937, Flory worked for two years at the Basic Research Laboratory located in the University of Cincinnati. During World War II, there was a need for research to develop synthetic rubber, so Flory joined the Esso Laboratories of the Standard Oil Development Company. From 1943 to 1948 Flory worked in the polymer research team of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

In 1948, Flory gave the George Fisher Baker lectures at Cornell University, and subsequently joined the university as a professor. In 1957, Flory and his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Flory was executive director of research at the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. In 1961, he took up a professorship at Stanford University in the department of chemistry. After retirement, Flory remained active in the world of chemistry, running research labs both in Stanford, and IBM.

===Career and polymer science===
Flory&#x27;s earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental Station. In condensation polymerization, he challenged the assumption that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew, and by arguing that the reactivity was independent of the size, he was able to derive the result that the number of chains present decreased with size exponentially. In addition polymerization, he introduced the important concept of chain transfer to improve the kinetic equations and remove difficulties in understanding the polymer size distribution.

In 1938, after Carothers&#x27; death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups and the theory of polymer networks or gels. This led to the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation, which was equivalent to percolation on the Bethe lattice and represents the first paper in the percolation field.

In 1940 he joined the Linden, NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company where he developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures. In 1943 he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear as head of a group on polymer fundamentals. In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye, then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University, invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures. He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year. He was initiated into the Tau chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at Cornell in 1949. At Cornell he elaborated and refined his Baker Lectures into his magnum opus, &quot;Principles of Polymer Chemistry&quot; which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press. This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers, and is still widely used to this day.

Flory introduced the concept of excluded volume, coined by Werner Kuhn in 1934, to polymers. Excluded volume refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics – the long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point.

Among his accomplishments are an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution, the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory, the extension of polymer physics concepts to the field of liquid crystals, and the derivation of the Flory exponent, which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution.

===The Flory convention===
:&quot;see Flory convention for details.&quot;
In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. Applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates will describe the same three-dimensional structure using the Flory convention.

== Awards and honors ==
Flory was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1953 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. In 1968, he received the Charles Goodyear Medal. He also received the Priestley Medal and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1974. He received the Carl-Dietrich-Harries-Medal for commendable scientific achievements in 1977. Flory received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 &quot;for his fundamental achievements both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of the macromolecules.&quot; Additionally in 1974 Flory was awarded the National Medal of Science in Physical Sciences. The medal was presented to him by President Gerald Ford. This award was given to him because of his research on the &quot;formation and structure of polymeric substances&quot;.

<text>Just Imagine is a 1930 American pre-Code science fiction musical-comedy film, directed by David Butler. The film is known for its art direction and special effects in its portrayal of New York City in an imagined 1980. &quot;Just Imagine&quot; stars El Brendel, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, John Garrick and Marjorie White. The &quot;man from 1930&quot; was played by El Brendel, an ethnic vaudeville comedian of a forgotten type: the Swedish immigrant.

The film starts with a preamble showing life in 1880, where the people believed themselves the &quot;last word in speed&quot;. It switches to 1930, with the streets crowded with automobiles and lined with electric lights and telephone wires. It then switches to 1980, where the tenement houses have morphed into 250-story buildings, connected by suspension bridges and multi-lane elevated roads.
==Plot==
In 1980, J-21 (John Garrick) sets his aircraft on &quot;hover&quot; mode in New York, lands and converses with the beautiful LN-18 (Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan). He describes how the marriage tribunal had refused to consider J-21&#x27;s marital filing and applications, and LN-18 is going to be forced to marry the conceited and mean MT-3 (Kenneth Thomson). J-21 plans to visit LN-18 that night.

RT-42 (Frank Albertson) tries to cheer him up by taking him to see a horde of surgeons experimentally revive a man from 1930, who was struck by lightning while playing golf, and was killed. The man (originally named Peterson now is called Single O) is taken in hand by RT-42 and J-21, where it is revealed that aircraft have replaced cars, numbers have replaced names, pills have replaced food and liquor, and the only legal babies come from vending machines. That night, LN-18 feigns a headache, and her father and the despicable MT-3 decide to go to &quot;the show&quot; without her. The second they are gone, RT-42 and J-21 appear and woo D-6 and LN-18 respectively. MT-3 and LN-18&#x27;s father return quite early, as MT-3 was highly suspicious, and RT-42 and J-21 hide. However, the game is foiled by the moronic Single O (El Brendel), the man from 1930, becoming addicted to pill-highballs, getting drunk, and trying to get some more pill-highballs from J-21.

J-21 is depressed, but is contacted by Z-4, the scientist. He is told that Z-4 (Hobart Bosworth) has built a &quot;rocket plane&quot; that can carry three men to Mars. After a farewell party where J-21 works, on the &quot;Pegasus,&quot; a dirigible they call an &quot;air-liner,&quot; the rocket blasts off, carrying J-21, RT-42 and Single O, who has stowed away for the synthetic rum. Landing on Mars, they are received by the Queen, Looloo and the King, Loko. That night, Looloo and Loko take them to see a &quot;show,&quot; a Martian opera, where a horde of trained Martian ourang-outangs dance about. They are suddenly attacked by Booboo and Boko, the evil twins (everyone on Mars is a twin) of the King and Queen. They escape and return to Earth, and as one of the first men on another planet, J-21 is permitted to marry LN-18. Finally, Single O is reunited with his aged son, Axel.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Art/cinematography===
The massive, distinctive Art Deco cityscape, for which &quot;Just Imagine&quot; has come to be best remembered, was built in a former Army balloon hangar by a team of 205 technicians over a five-month period. The giant miniature cost $168,000 to build and was wired with 15,000 miniature lightbulbs (an additional 74 arc lights were used to light the city from above); other production credits include costumes by Alice O&#x27;Neil, Sophie Wachner, and Dolly Tree.

===Special effects===
The sequence in which the El Brendel character is revived from the dead features the first screen appearance of the spectacular electrical equipment assembled by Kenneth Strickfaden, seen again and more famously in James Whale&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). Over 50 special effects shots combining previously photographed backgrounds with live foreground action were accomplished using the Dunning Process. Rear projection technology of the scale and quality required was not available at the time.

The set design in the form of glass pictures and miniatures was done by Stephen Goosson, Ralph Hammeras, SPFX-guru Willis O&#x27;Brien, and Marcel Delgado (all uncredited).

===Music===
Of the DeSylva, Brown and Henderson songs introduced in the film, &quot;Never Swat a Fly&quot; was covered as the classic 1930 recording by McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers, the 1967 revival by Jim Kweskin &amp; The Jug Band, and more recent recordings by Doc Cheatham among others.

==Reception==
Mordaunt Hall called &quot;Just Imagine&quot;, &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;highly imaginative&quot; and &quot;intriguing&quot; and praised the costumes and set design. This expensive film was a one-time-only novelty stunt, bolstered by the short-lived popularity of El Brendel. &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; &quot;cordially recommended&quot; the film, saying it &quot;shows us many of the wonders that our science fiction authors have been writing about&quot;.

Although a box-office flop, however, it was eventually able to make back some of its production costs by the studio shopping out clips of the futuristic sets for other films of the period. The miniature and full-scale mock-up of the Mars spaceship from this movie were later used in the Universal serial &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and its sequels as Dr. Zarkov&#x27;s spaceship. Also re-used was footage of dancing girls cavorting about and on a Martian idol with moving arms.

By the time &quot;Just Imagine&quot; was released, movie musicals had greatly declined in popularity. As a result, major American studios would not back another big budget science fiction film until 1951. There was to be only one other American science-fiction musical in that period, &quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Alive&quot; (1933), which failed at the box-office. Film serials were an exception to this general trend, however.

The first &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial from 1936 had an unusually large budget for a serial of the time, and Gene Autry&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot; from 1935 can loosely be considered a science fiction musical serial.

===Awards===
&quot;Just Imagine&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Stephen Goosson and Ralph Hammeras. It is notable as the first film of the science fiction genre to be nominated for an Oscar.

<text>OXO ( ) is an American manufacturer of kitchen utensils, office supplies, and housewares, founded in 1990 and based in New York City. OXO products are made in the USA and China. They provide a non-stick pro-Bakeware line that is completely made in the US. Some OXO products come with a &quot;Made in China&quot; tag.

== History ==
OXO was founded by Sam Farber, an entrepreneur in the housewares industry, and his son, John Farber. Sam Farber chose the name &quot;OXO&quot; as an ambigram that renders the three letters in &quot;OXO&quot; the same regardless of their orientation, either horizontal or vertically. Noticing that his wife, Betsy, who suffered from mild arthritis in her hands, was having difficulty gripping ordinary kitchen tools, he saw an opportunity to create more comfortable cooking tools that would benefit users. He worked with the design firm Smart Design to create the initial products in the line, including the Swivel Peeler, and Oxo continued to collaborate with Smart for many years. The first group of 15 OXO Good Grips kitchen tools were introduced to the U.S. market at the Gourmet Products Show in San Francisco, in 1990.

Sam Farber sold OXO to General Housewares Corporation in 1992. General Housewares Corporation was acquired by World Kitchen LLC. in 2000. In June 2004, Helen of Troy Limited bought OXO housewares for $273.2 million.

<text>The Exeter Ship Canal, also known as the Exeter Canal is a canal leading from (and beside) the River Exe to Exeter Quay in the city of Exeter, Devon, England. It was first constructed in the 1560s, predating the &quot;canal mania&quot; period, and is one of the oldest artificial waterways in the UK.

==History==
At the start of Exeter&#x27;s history, the River Exe was tidal and navigable up to the city walls enabling it to be a busy port. In the 1270s or 1280s, the Countess of Devon, Isabella de Fortibus, built a weir across the river to power her mills (this weir is remembered in the name of the nearby suburb Countess Wear). This had the effect of cutting off Exeter&#x27;s port from the sea and damaging its salmon fisheries. In 1290, trade with Exeter&#x27;s port was restored, only to be blocked by a new weir built in 1317 by Hugh de Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon (Isabella&#x27;s cousin), who also built a quay at Topsham. Because of the blockages on the river, boats were forced to unload at Topsham and the earls were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to Exeter. For the next 250 years the city petitioned the King to have the waterway reopened, to no avail, until 1550 when Edward VI finally granted permission. However, it was by then too late because the river channel had silted up.

In 1563, Exeter traders employed John Trew of Glamorgan to build a canal to bypass the weirs and rejoin the River Exe in the centre of the city where a quay would be built. Work began in February 1564, and was completed in Autumn 1566 or early 1567. The canal had three locks with vertical gates – the first pound locks to be built in Britain. They accommodated boats up to 16 tonnes. The original cut was deep and wide (0.9 m by 5 m). It ran one and from just below the Countess Weir to the centre of Exeter. This navigation was not very effective; it could not be entered at all states of the tide, and the double transfer of cargo over such a short distance made it uncompetitive with road transport. The weir that maintains the water level in the quay is still named &quot;Trew&#x27;s Weir&quot; after the canal&#x27;s builder.
In 1677 the canal was extended and the entrance was moved downstream to Topsham. In 1701 the canal was deepened and widened to allow the passage of ocean-going ships. At the same time the number of locks on the canal was reduced to one. Floodgates were also fitted to the canal entrance. These improvements led to the canal being highly successful until demand for access declined with the end of the wool trade in the early 19th century and later with the rise of the railways.

There were many notable failures to connect Exeter and the South West to the national canal and rail networks: The Grand Western Canal linking Exeter to Bristol (1796) was never completed; the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway link to the canal basin was postponed in 1832 and 1844; the South Devon Railway ran services to the canal from 1867, but by this time the canal was too small to attract the sizeable ocean-going vessels and the canal was taken over by its creditors for sixteen years. Use of the canal has declined gradually ever since.

===20th century===
In 1939 the canal was still carrying some 63,000 tons of material annually, and after the war it was still seen as a useful means of transporting goods to and from its basin at Haven Banks, opposite Exeter Quay. Planning for the city after The Blitz recommended that Turf Lock, the canal&#x27;s junction with the estuary be deepened and enlarged to allow ships of 600 tons to pass.

In May 1944 the Countess Weir Road bridge (present day A379) was used in rehearsals for the D-Day attack on the &#x27;Canal de Caen&#x27; (Pegasus Bridge) and the River Orne (Horsa Bridge), by the Second Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. A plaque acknowledging this is sited on the south side of the bridges on the east bank.
One of the last regular commercial uses of the canal was the tanker &quot;Esso Jersey&quot;, which served the Esso oil terminal. The ship was known as the &quot;Kieler&quot; from 1977, and was scrapped in 1984. It was the largest ship to use the canal, and delivered a final load of 244 tons of petrol in July 1971. Commercial traffic ceased after a coaster unloaded a cargo of timber in December 1973. However, the ship &quot;Countess Weir&quot; continued to use the canal. It had been built in 1963 as a sludge carrier, and was used to take sewage sludge from the Exeter sewage works out to sea, where it was dumped. It was originally named &quot;SW2&quot;, but became the &quot;Countess Weir&quot; in 1974. It was operated by the city council, who owned the treatment works, and had to be modified slightly in 1975, as it would not fit under the newly constructed M5 motorway bridge. Ownership of the treatment works and the vessel passed to South West Water when the water industry was privatised in 1989, and dumping of sludge at sea ceased on 31 December 1998. The ship made a ceremonial visit to the canal in January 1999, after which it was sold.

The fall of commercial traffic in the 1960s coincided with the rise of leisure use of the canal. In the 1970s, the basin provided the backdrop for the filming of quayside activity in the historical drama &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, even though the series was supposed to be set in Liverpool. In 2002 the future of the canal looked brighter when the city basin was included in a £24 million redevelopment scheme by Exeter Quay Developments, a consortium led by the construction company McAlpine. The quay area retains a mix of Georgian and Victorian buildings, repurposed for modern use, including the custom house which dates from 1681. The basin has seen a lot of redevelopment, including residential buildings in a mock warehouse style, with the older buildings finding new uses as antique shops, cafes, restaurants and studios. The canal basin itself is popular for a range of water sports, including canoeing, rowing and kayaking.

Throughout the year the Butts Ferry, a small hand powered passenger ferry, operates across the river by Exeter quay and canal basin during the day, though there is a footbridge close at hand. A ferry has been operating here since at least 1641.

==Administration==
The canal is owned by Exeter City Council. In 2017, they announced that it runs at a deficit, losing around £110,000 per year. They began negotiations with the Canal and River Trust in September 2016, with a view to transferring responsibility, but the talks were ended in December, with the council unhappy about the cost and likely outcomes of the action. They have since been looking at ways to increase the volume of boat traffic using the canal, but the major obstacles to this are the lifting bridge and swing bridge at Countess Weir, which carry separate carriageways of the A38 road over the canal. Opening the bridges is only carried out infrequently, because of the disruption it causes to traffic on the A38, and each opening costs around £800 in administrative and staffing costs. The council and a support group, the Friends of Exeter Ship Canal, are looking at ways this could be overcome.

The Countess Weir swing bridge dates from 1936, while the lifting bridge was added in 1972, when the A38 was the main route to the West Country, prior to the building of the M5 motorway viaduct in 1977. Options being considered are to replace the two bridges with a single swing bridge or lift bridge, building a new bridge at a higher level to give much more clearance, and the construction of a drop lock, to lower the level of the waterway beneath the bridges. Both bridges were nearing the end of their operational life in 2019, and the Friends group have been campaigning for the new bridges to be built with increased headroom. There is a possibility that this could be funded by the government&#x27;s Major Road Network scheme. Development plans were given a boost in 2021, when Exeter Ship Canal and Basin became the United Kingdom&#x27;s fourth Heritage Harbour, an award given by the Maritime Heritage Trust and National Historic Ships UK. Increasing the air draft of the bridges to would enable many more coastal boats to use the harbour, including those catching fish and shellfish.

<text>The Lower Neches Valley Authority was established in 1933 by the state legislature as a district to store, control, conserve, and utilize the water of the lower Neches River valley in Texas. The LNVA, the second river district created by the state of Texas, is currently one of 23 river districts in the state. It includes all of Jefferson, Hardin, and Tyler counties and parts of Jasper, Liberty, and Chambers counties.

==Governance==
The LNVA is governed by a board of nine directors appointed by the Texas Water Development Board. Until 1943 the authority was without any facilities to produce revenue. Since 1943 the irrigation system has been renovated many times. It supplies water to the cities (except Beaumont), industry, and rice growers of Jefferson County and portions of Chambers and Liberty counties. 

The LNVA has also cooperated with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in planning, financing, and constructing several large multipurpose dams on the Neches River and Angelina River. Other projects sponsored by the authority include the construction of a permanent saltwater barrier on the Neches River, a comprehensive water-quality management program, and the construction of boat ramps and other recreational facilities on area waterways.

==The system==

===Canals===
The LNVA system includes of canals covering a . The canals deliver fresh water to &quot;...eight cities and water districts, 26 industries, and over 100 irrigated farms...&quot; Water is drawn from the lower Neches River and Pine Island Bayou in north Beaumont, with 21 large pumps delivering between 20,000 and 110,000 gallons of water a minute; it has a capability of delivering more than one billion gallons of water a day. Up to maximum

===Salt water barrier===
Prior to construction of the permanent barrier, the LNVA installed temporary barriers across Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River upstream of their confluence 36 times between 1940 and 2000, to prevent contamination of their waters from salt water. 

A permanent saltwater barrier across the Neches River is located downstream about one-half mile from the confluence of Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River. It is about eight miles north of Beaumont. The barrier, constructed between 2000 and 2003, prevents saltwater contamination during periods of low river flows. The permanent saltwater barrier project had a budgeted cost of $50 million, with the federal government paying 75% of the cost and the LNVA responsible for the remaining 25%. The barrier, over 1,000 feet long, includes a 650-foot-long overflow barrier; five forty-five foot wide tainter gates; and a fifty-six foot wide navigation lane regulated by two thirty-foot sector gates. It also allows the conservation of 200,000 acre-feet per year of freshwater upstream in Sam Rayburn Reservoir. 

The salt water barrier project also provides recreational opportunities. Public launching ramps are located on the Jefferson County side of the barrier. The area has a walking trail and playground. The state of Texas created its sixty-first (61st) canoe paddling trail in 2014, with the trail head at the salt water barrier. It progresses north into waters included in the Big Thicket National Preserve.

<doc id="1178749" wikidata="Q654526" url="?curid=1178749" title="Grindhouse">
<text>A grindhouse or action house is an American term for a theatre that mainly shows low-budget horror, splatter, and exploitation films for adults. According to historian David Church, this theater type was named after the &quot;grind policy&quot;, a film-programming strategy dating back to the early 1920s that continuously showed films at cut-rate ticket prices that typically rose over the course of each day. This exhibition practice was markedly different from the era&#x27;s more common practice of fewer shows per day and graduated pricing for different seating sections in large urban theatres, which were typically studio-owned.

== History ==
Due to these theaters&#x27; proximity to controversially sexualized forms of entertainment like burlesque, the term &quot;grindhouse&quot; has often been erroneously associated with burlesque theaters in urban entertainment areas such as 42nd Street in New York City, where bump and grind dancing and striptease were featured. In the film &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot; (1943) one of the characters refers to one such burlesque theatre on 42nd Street as a &quot;grindhouse,&quot; but Church points out the primary definition in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is for a movie theater distinguished by three criteria:

# Shows a variety of films, in continuous succession
# Low admission fees
# Films screened are frequently of poor quality or low (artistic) merit

Church states the first use of the term &quot;grind house&quot; was in a 1923 &quot;Variety&quot; article, which may have adopted the contemporary slang usage of &quot;grind&quot; to refer to the actions of barkers exhorting potential patrons to enter the venue.

Double, triple, and &quot;all night&quot; bills on a single admission charge often encouraged patrons to spend long periods of time in the theaters. The milieu was largely and faithfully captured at the time by &quot;Sleazoid Express&quot;, an exploitation aficionado magazine that ran in the 1980s.

Because grindhouse theaters were associated with a lower class audience, grindhouse theaters gradually became perceived as disreputable places that showed disreputable films, regardless of the variety of films – including subsequent-run Hollywood films – that were actually screened. Similar second-run screenings are held at discount theaters and neighborhood theatres; the distinguishing characteristics of the &quot;grindhouse&quot; are its typical urban setting and the programming of first-run films of low merit, not predominantly second-run films which had received wide releases.

===Television pressure===
The introduction of television greatly eroded the audience for local and single-screen movie theaters, many of which were built during the cinema boom of the 1930s. In combination with urban decay after white flight out of older city areas in the mid to late 1960s, changing economics forced these theaters to either close or offer something that television could not. In the 1970s, many of these theaters became venues for exploitation films, such as adult pornography and sleaze, or slasher horror, and dubbed martial arts films from Hong Kong.

===Content===
Films shot for and screened at grindhouses characteristically contain large amounts of sex, violence, or bizarre subject matter. One featured genre were &quot;roughies&quot; or sexploitation films, a mix of sex, violence and sadism. Quality varied, but low budget production values and poor print quality were common. Critical opinions varied regarding typical grindhouse fare, but many films acquired cult following and critical praise.

===Decline===
By the mid 1980s, home video and cable movie channels threatened to render the grindhouse obsolete. By the end of the decade, these theaters had vanished from Los Angeles&#x27;s Broadway and Hollywood Boulevard, New York City&#x27;s Times Square and San Francisco&#x27;s Market Street. Another example was the Jolar Theater in Nashville, Tennessee, on lower Broadway, which was active until it burned down on April 14, 1978.

By the mid-1990s, these particular theaters had all but disappeared from the United States. Excerpts from &quot;Sleazoid Express&quot; were compiled into a book of the same title by authors Bill Landis and Michelle Clifford; the book discusses various exploitation subgenres as well as New York City&#x27;s 42nd Street grindhouses themselves.

<text>A pump boat (usually variation as pambot in local languages) is an outrigger canoe (&quot;&quot;) native to Southeast Asia powered by a small gasoline or diesel engine. Smaller pump boats might be powered by the sort of small single-cylinder engine used to drive a water pump. Larger ones are often powered by recycled automobile engines.

Pump boats are a utility boat in the Philippines, used for nearly everything from inter-island transportation to fishing and even the Philippine Coast Guard. Pump boats are also used by Sama-Bajau migrants and refugees in Sabah, Malaysia and eastern Indonesia (where it is known as &quot;pombot&quot;).

<text>The Angelina River is formed by the confluence of Barnhardt and Shawnee creeks northwest of Laneville in southwest central Rusk County, Texas, United States.

A tributary of the Neches River, the river flows southeast for and forms the boundaries between Cherokee and Nacogdoches, Angelina and Nacogdoches, and Angelina and San Augustine counties. It passes under US 59 via former Angelina River Bridge. It empties into the Neches River north of Jasper in northwestern Jasper County.

The Sam Rayburn Reservoir is on the southern part of the river.

==History==
The river was named for a native Hasinai girl whom Spanish missionaries called Angelina. It was well known to Spanish and French explorers and to missionaries in East Texas. Spanish land grants along the stream date back to the later eighteenth century, and there was considerable settlement in the area during the Mexican period.

In 1832, the Battle of Nacogdoches spilled over onto the Angelina, when James Bowie ambushed the fleeing Mexican army at this river.

River traffic on the Angelina began to die in the 1880s with the arrival of the railroads. By 1900, the stream was no longer navigable. Farming and clear-cutting by the growing lumber industry in the river&#x27;s watershed caused the river to silt up, and numerous sandbars formed along its course.

<doc id="1178756" wikidata="Q13559828" url="?curid=1178756" title="Dry cell">
<text>A dry cell is a type of electric battery, commonly used for portable electrical devices. Unlike wet cell batteries, which have a liquid electrolyte, dry cells use an electrolyte in the form of a paste, and are thus less susceptible to leakage.
The dry cell was developed in 1886 by the German scientist Carl Gassner, after the development of wet zinc–carbon batteries by Georges Leclanché in 1866. A type of dry cell was also developed by the Japanese inventor Sakizō Yai in 1887.

== History ==
Many experimenters tried to immobilize the electrolyte of an electrochemical cell to make it more convenient to use. The Zamboni pile of 1812 is a high-voltage dry battery but capable of delivering only minute currents. Various experiments were made with cellulose, sawdust, spun glass, asbestos fibers, and gelatine.

In 1886, Carl Gassner obtained a German patent (No. 37,758) on a variant of the (wet) Leclanché cell, which came to be known as the dry cell because it did not have a free liquid electrolyte. Instead, the ammonium chloride was mixed with Plaster of Paris to create a paste, with a small amount of zinc chloride added in to extend the shelf life. The manganese dioxide cathode was dipped in this paste, and both were sealed in a zinc shell, which also acts as the anode. In November 1887, he obtained for the same device. A dry-battery was invented in Japan during the Meiji Era in 1887. The inventor was Sakizō Yai. However, Yai didn&#x27;t have enough money to file the patent, the first patent holder of a battery in Japan was not Yai, but Takahashi Ichisaburo. Wilhelm Hellesen also invented a dry-battery in 1887 and obtained in 1890.

Unlike previous wet cells, Gassner&#x27;s dry cell is more solid, does not require maintenance, does not spill, and can be used in any orientation. It provides a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the National Carbon Company in 1896. The NCC improved Gassner&#x27;s model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled cardboard, an innovation that leaves more space for the cathode and makes the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable electrical devices practical.

The zinc–carbon cell (as it came to be known) is still manufactured today.

== Design ==
A dry cell uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough moisture to allow current to flow. Unlike a wet cell, a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. Lead–acid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the gel battery. Wet cells have continued to be used for high-drain applications, such as starting internal combustion engines, because inhibiting the electrolyte flow tends to reduce the current capability.

A common dry cell is the zinc–carbon cell, sometimes called the dry Leclanché cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, the same as the alkaline cell (since both use the same zinc–manganese dioxide combination).

A standard dry cell comprises a zinc anode, usually in the form of a cylindrical pot, with a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a depolariser. In some designs, often marketed as &quot;heavy duty&quot;, the ammonium chloride is replaced with zinc chloride.

== Types ==

Primary cells are not rechargeable and are generally disposed of after the cell&#x27;s internal reaction has consumed the reactive starting chemicals.

Secondary cells are rechargeable, and may be reused multiple times.

<text>Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe is the third novel by English author George Eliot, pen name of Mary Ann Evans. It was published in 1861. An outwardly simple tale of a linen weaver, the novel is notable for its strong realism and its sophisticated treatment of a variety of issues ranging from religion to industrialisation to community.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a small Calvinist congregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street in Northern England. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation&#x27;s funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two pieces of evidence implicate Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery of the bag formerly containing the money in his own house. There is the strong suggestion that Silas&#x27;s best friend, William Dane, has framed him, since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Lots are drawn in the belief – also shared by Silas – that God will direct the process and establish the truth, but they indicate that Silas is guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and marries William instead. With his life shattered, his trust in God lost, and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city for a rural area where he is unknown.

Silas travels south to the Midlands and settles near the rural village of Raveloe in Warwickshire where he lives isolated and alone, choosing to have only minimal contact with the residents beyond his work as a linen weaver. He devotes himself wholeheartedly to his craft and comes to adore the coins, many of them gold, he earns and hoards from his weaving.

One foggy night, Silas&#x27;s two bags of coins are stolen by Dunstan (&quot;Dunsey&quot;) Cass, the dissolute younger son of Squire Cass, the town&#x27;s leading landowner. On discovering the theft, Silas sinks into a deep depression despite the villagers&#x27; attempts to aid him. Dunsey disappears, but the community makes no connection to the theft, since he has vanished several times before, and he accidentally killed the horse he was supported to sell for his elder brother, Geoffrey.

Godfrey Cass harbours a secret past. He is married to, but estranged from, Molly Farren, an opium-addicted working-class woman living in another town. This secret prevents Godfrey from marrying Nancy Lammeter, a virtuous, beautiful young middle-class woman. On a winter&#x27;s night, Molly tries to make her way to Squire Cass&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party with her two-year-old girl to announce that she is Godfrey&#x27;s wife. On the way, she takes opium, collapses in the snow and dies from the cold. The child wanders into Silas&#x27;s house. Silas follows the child&#x27;s tracks in the snow and discovers the dead woman. When he goes to the party for help, Godfrey goes to the scene of the accident, but resolves to tell no one that Molly was his wife. Molly&#x27;s death enables Godfrey to marry Nancy; he promises to abandon his dissolute life and reform.

Silas keeps the child and names her Hephzibah (nicknamed Eppie) after his deceased mother and sister. Eppie changes Silas&#x27;s life completely. He has been robbed of his material gold, but thinks that he has it returned to him symbolically in the form of the golden-haired child. Godfrey Cass continues to conceal the fact of his previous marriage, but keeps an eye on his child. He aids Marner in caring for Eppie with occasional financial gifts. Dolly Winthrop, Silas&#x27;s kindly neighbour, provides more practical help and support in bringing up the child. Eppie draws Silas into village society.

Sixteen years pass. Eppie considers Silas her father. Silas has found a place in the rural society and a purpose in life. Meanwhile, Godfrey and Nancy are childless, after the death of their only baby. Eventually, the skeleton of Dunstan Cass and Silas&#x27;s money are found at the bottom of the stone quarry near Silas&#x27;s home after the water level goes down, and the money is duly returned to Silas. Shocked by this revelation, and coming to the realisation of his own conscience, Godfrey confesses to Nancy that Molly was his first wife and that Eppie is his child. They offer to raise her as a gentleman&#x27;s daughter, much to Silas&#x27;s distress. Eppie politely but firmly refuses, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t think o&#x27; no happiness without him.&quot;

With his money restored, Silas takes Eppie to revisit Lantern Yard, but his old neighbourhood has been &quot;swept away&quot; in the intervening years; the place has been replaced by a large factory. No one knows what happened to Lantern Yard&#x27;s inhabitants. However, Silas contentedly resigns himself to not knowing and now leads a happy existence among his self-made family and friends. In the end, Eppie marries a local boy she has grown up with, Dolly&#x27;s son Aaron, and they move into Silas&#x27;s house, which has been newly improved courtesy of Godfrey.

==Characters==

* Silas Marner: lower class by birth, a weaver who is betrayed at Lantern Yard (site of a dissenting sect) by his treacherous friend William Dane, moves away to Raveloe (where the community is Church of England), becomes taken for a miser, as he accumulates a small fortune, only to have it stolen by Dunstan Cass. After these misfortunes, he gradually finds his happiness and virtue by the arrival of young Eppie (biological daughter of Godfrey Cass) whom he raises as his adopted child. Eppie turns out to be a beautiful girl and it is decided later that she will marry Aaron Winthrop.
* Squire Cass: Lord of the Manor of Raveloe and host of the party on the night when Eppie comes into Silas&#x27;s life.
* Godfrey Cass: upper class by birth but troubled over money, eldest son of the local squire, who is blackmailed by his dissolute brother Dunstan over his secret first marriage to Molly. When Molly dies, he feels relief, and escapes punishment for his betrayal and deceit, instead marrying Nancy.
* Dunstan Cass: second son of the local squire. He blackmails his older brother, until he disappears. He steals Silas&#x27;s gold after accidentally killing his older brother&#x27;s horse Wildfire. Many years pass before his corpse is found in a newly drained pit.
* Molly Farren: Godfrey&#x27;s first (and secret) wife, who has a child by him; an opium addict; lower class, impoverished. She dies in the attempt to reveal to the community her relationship with Godfrey, leaving the child, Eppie, to wander into Silas&#x27;s life.
* Eppie (Hephzibah): daughter of Molly and Godfrey, who is named by and cared for by Silas after the death of her mother. Mischievous in her early years, she grows into a radiant and beautiful young girl, devoted to her adoptive father.
* Nancy Cass (née Lammeter): Godfrey Cass&#x27;s second wife, a morally and socially respectable young woman, admired by her husband but deceived by him as regards his past.
* Priscilla Lammeter: Nancy&#x27;s plain, unmarried older sister, who supports Nancy and their father.
* Aaron Winthrop: son of Dolly, who marries Eppie at the end of the novel and is considered a happy match for her.
* Dolly Winthrop: mother to Aaron, wife of Ben; godmother to Eppie. Sympathetic to Silas and offers him practical support in raising the child.
* Ben Winthrop: wheelwright, largely invisible in the novel.
* Mr Snell, landlord of the Rainbow Inn, Raveloe.
* William Dane: William Dane is Silas&#x27;s former best friend at Lantern Yard. At the start of the novel, William betrays Silas by framing him for theft and marrying Silas&#x27;s fiancée Sarah.
* Sarah: Silas&#x27;s fiancée in Lantern Yard, who subsequently marries his treacherous friend William Dane.
* Mr Macey: the clerk at the local church, a tailor, very elderly by the end of the novel.
* Solomon Macey: Mr Macey&#x27;s brother, a talented violinist.
* Mr Crackenthorpe: rector of Raveloe and a justice of the peace.

* Dr Kimble: the doctor of Raveloe, who attends when Molly is found dead.
* Bob Cass: the Squire&#x27;s youngest son.
* Sally Oates: the wife of the town cobbler, who suffers from heart problems and dropsy. Silas gives her some herbal medicine that cures her, but also attracts unwanted attention from people who think he has magical powers.
* Mr. Tookey: the assistant tailor and deputy clerk of the parish in Raveloe. He is young and insecure, and often the target of jokes and sarcasm from the other villagers. He tends to lose his temper when people do not take him seriously.

==Analysis==
Lawrence Jay Dessner has drawn connections between the biographical circumstances of Eliot&#x27;s life in relation to events in the novel. Bruce K. Martin has discussed Eliot&#x27;s use of Godfrey Cass as &quot;both parallel and foil&quot; to Silas Marner in the structure of the novel. Fred C. Thomson has examined the multiple levels of the idea of alienation in the novel. Joseph Wiesenfarth has noted undercurrents of myth and legend, incorporated into a &#x27;realistic&#x27; context, along with contrasts of responsible and irresponsible behaviour in the contrasting fates of Silas Marner and the Cass brothers. David Sonstroem has studied ideas of chance and Darwinian thinking in the context of the plot and character fates in the novel. Susan Stewart has looked at the influence of folktales and ideology related to &#x27;work&#x27; vs &#x27;labour&#x27; in the novel. Ian Milner has examined two overarching themes of Silas Marner&#x27;s &#x27;loss and recovery of his humanity&#x27;, and of a conflict between stated moral values and the social realities juxtaposed with them. Robert H. Dunham has analysed the influence of the ideas and philosophy of William Wordsworth on the novel. Brian Swann has examined mythic and religious undertones in the novel. Jeff Nunokawa analyses ideas about physical touch, with respect to Silas Marner&#x27;s handling of his gold compared to his raising of Eppie, and connects them to sexual and sensual themes. Kate E. Brown has discussed overarching themes of time and temporality, with respect to the interlocked stories of Godfrey Cass and Silas Marner.

<text>Rose Porteous (born Rosario Magdalena Teresita Lacson on 26 October 1948), a Filipino-born Australian socialite, is best known for her marriage to Western Australia iron ore mining magnate Lang Hancock, and the protracted legal battle with his daughter, Gina Rinehart, over the circumstances that led to his death, and the distribution of his estate. The action, commenced by Rinehart in 1992, was eventually settled in 2003 following a coronial inquiry that determined Hancock died of natural causes. Porteous, who lives in Perth and Melbourne, is often referred to by the media as a socialite.

==Biography==
Born in Bacolod, Negros Occidental, Philippines, Porteous is the daughter of Nicolas Lacson and Amparo Lacson. Her grandfather, Gen. Aniceto Lacson, is a distinguished sugar baron who was also prominent military figure in Negros Occidental during the Philippine Revolution while her uncle, Arsenio Lacson, was the first elected mayor of Manila. Her brother, Salvador, is the chairman of LLIBI Inc., a leading firm since 1973.

After spending time in Hong Kong, Spain, Singapore and Malaysia, Porteous arrived in Australia in 1983 on a three-month working visa. Porteous began working as a maid for the newly widowed Hancock.

===Marriage to Hancock===

Hancock and Porteous became involved over the course of Porteous&#x27; employment and they were wed on 6 July 1985, in Sydney. Porteous, who was thirty-nine years younger than her husband, was often accused of gold digging because of their age disparity. As Porteous later stated: &quot;I have been accused of sleeping with every man in Australia ... I would have been a very busy woman.&quot; Gina Rinehart, who stood to inherit his entire estate, did not attend the wedding.

Although the marriage would later prove tumultuous, early on Hancock was clearly infatuated with his young wife. He gave her money and investments in real estate in the Sydney area. Porteous, in turn, helped Hancock to look and act like a much younger man, belying his eight decades. As &quot;The Age&quot; put it, &quot;Rose made Lang feel younger, sprucing up his wardrobe, dying his hair and getting rid of his cane&quot;. Together they built the &quot;Prix d&#x27;Amour&quot;, a lavish 16-block mansion overlooking the Swan River. The mansion, which was modelled after Tara, the plantation mansion in the movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, was the setting for many large parties at which Hancock and Porteous would &quot;dance into the night&quot;.

As the marriage wore on, however, the relationship between Hancock and Porteous began to break down. Rumours surfaced of her having disputes with servants and others close to Hancock, especially Rinehart, and as Hancock&#x27;s health worsened, so did his relationship with Porteous. Rinehart would later claim that Hancock&#x27;s bride had paid little attention to his worsening health, but had instead &quot;screeched at him for money&quot;. Although there were many quarrels, Hancock and Porteous remained married until his death in 1992.

===Legal action relating to the death of Hancock===
Porteous rose to prominence in the 1990s as the central figure in a series of lawsuits launched by her step-daughter, Gina Rinehart. Rinehart is the daughter of Lang Hancock and Hope Margaret Nicholas, Hancock&#x27;s second wife. On 25 June 1992, less than three months after Hancock&#x27;s death, Porteous married for the fourth time, to Hancock&#x27;s long-time friend William Porteous. Rinehart was indignant at the haste with which her stepmother had remarried.

Central to Rinehart&#x27;s lawsuits were the accusations that Porteous married Hancock only for his fortune and alleged that her stepmother&#x27;s actions had contributed to her father&#x27;s death. According to his daughter, the death was &quot;unexpected&quot; and came &quot;despite strong will to live&quot;. An autopsy showed that he had died of arteriosclerotic heart disease and police investigation revealed no evidence to contradict that. However, Hancock&#x27;s daughter insisted that her stepmother had unnaturally hastened his death. Two successive state coroners refused to allow an inquest, but one was eventually granted in 1999 under the direction of WA Attorney-General, Peter Foss.

After preliminary hearings during 2000, the inquest began in April 2001 with an initial estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks. The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: &quot;For anyone else it would be a tantrum, for me it&#x27;s just raising my voice.&quot; In the last few days of Hancock&#x27;s life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his will and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her. The inquest was put on hold after allegations that Rinehart had paid witnesses to appear and that some had lied in their testimony. It resumed three months later with a smaller witness list and ended with the finding that Hancock had died of natural causes and not as a result of Porteous&#x27; behaviour.

With a legal bill of A$2.7m, Rose and William Porteous commenced action against Rinehart, that was eventually settled out of court in 2003. A few months later, Porteous was revealed as one of several Australian celebrities promoting the SPC Ardmona brand of canned chopped tomatoes with the slogan, &quot;Rich and Thick&quot;. A short-lived one-off reality TV show titled &quot;Rose&quot; followed in November 2002. During 2005 it was reported that Porteous was being sued in excess of A$14 million by Melbourne-based law firm Slater &amp; Gordon in unpaid legal fees. It was reported that the unpaid fees came from court cases and legal actions in which Slater and Gordon represented Porteous, including the 2001 inquiry into the death of Hancock, and the long-running court battle with Rinehart, over his A$400 million-plus estate. It was reported that Porteous defaulted on two monthly payments to the legal firm of A$25,000 each. The dispute was lodged in the Victorian Supreme Court and Porteous unsuccessfully sought to have the matter heard in Western Australia, also claiming that she signed legal agreements in 2005, under duress. The matter was settled in November, with Porteous agreeing to pay the law firm A$13.25 million by 31 December 2005.

===Wealth===
The wealth of Porteous is unknown. In 2007 it was reported that she sold two adjoining penthouses in Toorak, Melbourne over six months for an estimated A$9 million, a profit of A$4 million. In March 2006, Porteous commissioned the demolition of her Perth mansion &quot;Prix d&#x27;Amour&quot;, built with Hancock in 1990 for an estimated cost of A$7 million. The 17-room landmark mansion featured French doors and windows, parquetry and marble floors and wrought iron. The estate, set on featured the main house, two guest houses, a tennis court and two swimming pools. The property was then subdivided into ten approximately lots (each with maximised views) which were put on the market for around A$5 million. In 2008–2009, two of these blocks were resold for a profit of A$1.5 million.

<text>&quot;Traitor to the Motherland family members&quot; () was a term in Article 58 of the Criminal Code of Russian SFSR (as amended on 8 June 1934 from the original wording of 1927). The amended Article dealt with the criminal prosecution of wives and children (kin punishment) of all people who were arrested and convicted as &quot;traitors of the Motherland&quot; in the Soviet Union during Stalinist purges of the 1930s and later.

==History==
The NKVD Order No. 00486 instructed about repression of wives and children of enemies of the people convicted to execution or imprisonment. It was dated August 15, 1937 and signed by Nikolai Yezhov acting both as chief of NKVD and General Commissar of State Security (chief of GUGB). The order implemented a resolution by Politburo. The corresponding parts of Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code) were modified accordingly.

As an element of the rollback of the Great Purge, on October 17, 1938, the later NKVD Order No. 00689, signed by Lavrenty Beria, said not to arrest wives automatically, together with their husbands, but only after consideration by a single NKVD officer. Only wives that were deemed &quot;politically untrustworthy or socially dangerous&quot; or who knew about the &quot;counter-revolutionary activity&quot; of their husbands were to be arrested.

In 1940, a Politburo decree and some other documents specified exile to the Far North of the family members of &quot;traitors of the Motherland&quot; who fled across the border. It primarily concerned the population of the territories newly acquired by the Soviet Union during the early years of World War II: the Baltic States, Western Belarus and Western Ukraine taken from Poland, and Northern Bukovina taken from Romania.

On June 24, 1942 the State Defense Committee issued top secret resolution No. 1926SS &quot;On the Family Members of Traitors of the Motherland&quot; that was signed by Stalin and restored some of the original wording.

==Order No. 00486==
All cases were to be considered by the Special Council of the NKVD.

Wives were subject to imprisonment into labor camps for terms of &quot;at least 5–8 years&quot;.

&quot;Socially dangerous&quot; children were to be placed in labor camps, corrective labor colonies, or special-regimen orphanages (see also: Orphans in the Soviet Union). The remaining orphaned children were to be placed in ordinary orphanages or with non-convicted relatives (if the latter wished). Personnel of the orphanages to house the children of the convicted were to be purged and refitted with politically reliable staff to properly supervise the &quot;correction&quot; of the children.

<text>Cihu Mausoleum (), officially known as the Mausoleum of Late President Chiang () or President Chiang Kai-shek Mausoleum, is the temporary resting place of President Chiang Kai-shek. It is located in Daxi District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. When Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, he was not buried in the traditional Chinese fashion but entombed in a black marble sarcophagus, since he expressed the wish to be eventually buried in his native Fenghua in Zhejiang province once the Kuomintang (KMT) recovered mainland China from the Communists.

==Lake and residence==
Cihu (慈湖) literally means &quot;benevolence lake&quot;, and it refers to the lake located near the tomb-site. The lake is divided into two smaller lakes, each with a canal connecting them together. It was formerly called &quot;Green Water Lake&quot; () until Chiang Kai-shek renamed it as &quot;Cihu&quot; in 1962 because the scenery reminded him of his benevolent mother and his home town, Fenghua. Chiang loved the lake so much that he had an official residence built nearby to architecturally resemble the houses in Fenghua. He also named his favorite residence &quot;Cihu&quot;, which was converted to his mausoleum upon his death in 1975. Chiang&#x27;s body lies in the main hall of the residence. The residence was designed by architect Yang Cho-cheng.

The Cihu lake is part of the &quot;Taoyuan Tableland and Ponds&quot; potential heritage site identified by the Taiwan Bureau of Cultural Heritage.

==Tomb==
The Presidential Burial Place was formerly under the jurisdiction of the Republic of China Ministry of National Defense and guarded by the Republic of China Military Police. Management of the grounds was transferred to the Taoyuan County government in 2007, and the military police were removed. Two ceremonial guards from the armed forces stand at attention at the entrance to the former Chiang residence. It is customary to give a respectful bow. Visitors are not allowed to take photographs inside the mausoleum, a prohibition that doesn&#x27;t apply to the outside.

Cihu is perennially open daily for visits from 8am to 4pm, though it was closed from December 2007 to May 2008 during the waning months of Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s administration. Interest in the Burial Place was actually revived during these two years as it became embroiled in the then ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s campaign to remove public vestiges of the man many see as a brutal dictator. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek statues from around Taiwan were relocated to the hillside park near the mausoleum. 

Prior to the late 1990s, visitors would line up hours for the chance to pay their respects to Chiang Kai-shek (either by bowing three times or saluting before the sarcophagus). Schoolchildren were often bussed in to do the same. At the anniversary of his death on April 5, high-ranking Kuomintang officials would pay homage to the late President in lavish ceremonies. Since democratization of Taiwan during the 1990s the visitors to Cihu have dwindled in their numbers, and the next generation of KMT officials have visited with less pomp and ceremony. Supporters of Taiwan independence (and pro-independence leaders such as Chen Shui-bian) do not visit the site due to their dislike for Chiang Kai-shek—a leader whom they viewed as one who imposed authoritarian rule on Taiwan.
When Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, died in 1988 he was also entombed in a similar fashion in nearby Touliao Mausoleum, Daxi. This gained Daxi the reputation as the “township of the Presidents”. In 2004, Chiang Fang-liang, the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County. The state funeral ceremony was planned for late 2006, but due to repeated delays, no ceremony was ever held or materialized. There was public debate if another national funeral should be held again for the burial in Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery, with fervent supporters of Taiwan independence against granting honors to someone whom they view as a dictator. However, President Chen was inclined to hold another national funeral (the first to invoke the state funeral law) but limited it to one day. Chiang Fang-liang and Soong Mei-ling had agreed in 1997 that the former leaders be first buried but still be moved to mainland China in the event of reunification. Soong Mei-ling died in 2003 and was entombed at Ferncliff Cemetery in New York. Chiang Fang-liang died in 2004 and her cremated remains were placed next to her husband&#x27;s tomb at Touliao.

With the election of Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou in the 2008 Republic of China presidential election, Taoyuan County officials hoped the mausoleum would be reopened and planned to give the public a glimpse of a previously restricted section of the park. The residence was converted into his temporary resting site after his death on 5 April 1975 and opened to visitors. But the mysterious grounds behind the mausoleum remained under the control of the Ministry of National Defense, making it impossible for the public to appreciate the beauty of the location or Chiang&#x27;s security precautions. The trail into the lush woodlands of the restricted area is punctuated with blockhouses, stone-walled sentry posts and bomb shelters, reflecting the tensions between Chiang&#x27;s government and its Chinese communist rival and his concern for his own safety. It has recently been revealed that the site was involved in the top secret plan to retake mainland China called Project National Glory (國光計劃). In April 1964, Chiang ordered the construction of air-raid shelters and five military offices at Cihu, which served as a secret command center for Project National Glory. 
The tomb was vandalized by pro-independence activists on 28 February 2018, the 71st anniversary of the 228 incident, and the activists were later arrested. Because of the vandalism, the tomb is now separated by a glass panel for visitors to view the sarcophagus from the outside, therefore the room is no longer accessible to the general public.

==History==

===Māori history===
Whitianga has been continuously occupied for more than a thousand years since Māori explorer Kupe&#x27;s iwi (tribe) settled here after his visit in about 950 AD. Following this visit, many of Kupe&#x27;s tribe settled here. Te Whitianga o Kupe is the original place name of the town, meaning Kupe&#x27;s crossing place.

Whitianga Pā, located on the ferry landing side of the river is a notable site. According to Ngāti Hei history, the earliest known chief occupying the rock was Hei Turepe. The pā is protected on three sides by sheer cliffs. The hill leading up to the pā on the fourth side is defended by a 22-foot man-made ditch which is now part of the track leading down to Back Bay where pā inhabitants had access to shellfish. On Cook&#x27;s visit to the site in November 1769, the inhabitants who welcomed him believed the pā had been disused for a generation since it had been attacked by a Tauranga chief who married the slain chief&#x27;s wife and settled peacefully into the area. Whitianga rock has several holes cut into the stone that were used as firepits, water stores, and palisade holes. Cook noted burnt palisade stumps as evidence that an earlier attack had evicted the ancient pā&#x27;s residents.

===Captain Cook&#x27;s visit – 1769===

The people of Hei commemorated their leader in a few place names, one being the bay at the head of which he had settled, Te Whanganui A Hei, (the Great Bay of Hei). This large sheltered bay was later renamed by Captain James Cook when he came here in November 1769 to observe the transit of Mercury. Cook was accompanied by Charles Green, the Royal Society expedition astronomer who died on the homeward journey in 1771.

From Cook&#x27;s journal – &quot;my reasons for putting in here were the hopes of discerning a good harbour and the desire I had of being in some convenient place to observe the Transit of Mercury, which happens on the 9th instant and will be wholly visible here if the day is clear between 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock.&quot; Cook also named the Whitianga Harbour &quot;River of Mangroves&quot; and this area is still referred to as &quot;The River&quot;.

The sighting of the Transit of Mercury is commemorated at Cooks Beach by a cairn of Coromandel granite which tells the story: &quot;In this bay was anchored 5 Nov 1769, HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, Lieutenant James Cook RN, Commander. He observed the transit of Mercury and named this bay.&quot;

===European settlement===
The original European settlement was situated on the opposite side of the river from approximately 1836 to 1881.

Whitianga stone wharf, built in 1838 on that east bank of the river, is the oldest remaining wharf in the country. It served a timber mill and shipbuilding yard. It was renovated in 2015. The ferry across the river uses the wharf as its eastern terminal.

Whitianga hotel wharf was built in the early 1870s. Coromandel County Council took formal ownership of it in 1926. By 1927 there were complaints that it was silting up. On 4 March 1932 a replacement was completed. It was removed in May 1964. SS &quot;Fingal&quot; was launched in 1879 to serve Tauranga, Mercury Bay and Tairua and became part of the Northern Steamship Company fleet in 1881. Their weekly service from Auckland ended about 1947. The Minister of Conservation approved construction of a marina in the former wharf area on 24 November 1992.

HMS Buffalo is a wreck in Mercury Bay; this ship was the first ship to settle the people of the Adelaide company who established the city of Adelaide in South Australia.

==Industry==

Historically, Whitianga was a centre for boat building, kauri milling, flax milling, gold mining and gum digging. For many years, it was a leading timber port, with sailing ships from Norway, Sweden, France, Italy and Great Britain coming to load timber. Overseas vessels of 2000 tons with a draught of 18&quot; and carrying with their decks loads over a million feet of timber worked the harbour entrance. The larger ships were towed into the port from near Centre Island. Over a period of sixty years, it is estimated over 500 million feet of kauri was exported from the Whitianga district.

The first kauri gum was exported in 1844. It reached its peak in 1899 when over 11,000 long tons of gum was exported at an average of $120 per ton.

Today Whitianga serves as a small regional centre for the eastern side of the Coromandel Peninsula and Mercury Bay area. It is a focal point for local fishing, farming and tourism industry, such as the nearby Te Whanganui-A-Hei (Cathedral Cove) marine reserve and associated famous beach and cave. Cathedral Cove was used in the movie &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;.

The area surrounding Whitianga (222 square km) is currently under a mineral prospecting license granted by the Crown to mining company Waihi Gold (a subsidiary of Newmont Corporation Colorado, USA).

==Social==

74.8% of Whitianga residents are New Zealand born, 85.1% identify as European, and 17% are of Maori descent. Whitianga has a relatively large number of older residents. 32.3% of residents are aged 60 years and over (the New Zealand average for this age group is 19.8%). It also has a large number of baches or holiday homes. 39.1% of the private dwellings in Whitianga were unoccupied on Census night, 2013. (By contrast, the average number of unoccupied dwellings in New Zealand was 11.1%).

In 2013 Whitianga had an unemployment level of 6.2%, lower than the national average of 7.1. 36.2% of households with income were in the lowest quartile, earning under $33,000 (versus 25% of people nationwide), 33.5% in the medium lowest (versus 25% nationwide), 21% in the medium highest (versus 25% nationwide), and 9.4% earned income over $109,431 which put them in the highest quartile (versus 25% nationwide). Whitianga scored 1008 on the Social Deprivation Index.

==Education==
Mercury Bay Area School is a coeducational composite (years 1–13) school with a roll of as of The first primary school opened in the area in 1872. A District High School opened in 1951 and moved to the present site two years later. In February 1981 it became an area school.
==Transport==
Whitianga is served by State Highway 25, the main highway looping around the Coromandel Peninsula. It is also served by the small Whitianga Aerodrome, which receives flights by Air Auckland with their Cessna 172 and 206 on a regular basis, FlyStark with their Cessna 172 and GippsAero GA8 Airvan aeroplanes and Sunair with their Cessna 172 and Piper Aztec planes. InterCity buses and Go Kiwi Shuttle serve the community with transportation to Whitianga from Thames, Auckland and other locations around the Coromandel Peninsula and North Island.

==Media==
Whitianga is served by &quot;The Mercury Bay Informer&quot;, &quot;The Hauraki Herald&quot;, Coromandel&#x27;s More FM, and Coromandel&#x27;s CFM.

==Events==
An annual scallop festival is held in September every year to celebrate seafood, particularly scallops.

The Whitianga Speed Festival was held in 2009 and 2010.

A New Year&#x27;s Eve festival and concert, known as Coromandel Gold, was held from 2009 to 2012.

<text>David Allen Grossman (born August 23, 1956) is an American author and trainer who conducts seminars on the psychology of lethal force. He is a retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. 

==Early life and military career==
Grossman was born in Frankfurt, West Germany on August 23, 1956.

==Post-military life==
Following his retirement from the Army, Grossman founded the Killology Research Group to give seminars about the physiological and the psychological effects of having to use lethal force for law enforcement officers and soldiers. 

Grossman also speaks at civilian events on ways to reduce violence in society and deal with the aftermath of violent events such as school shootings. As a civilian, Grossman has been an expert witness in numerous state and federal court cases and was part of the prosecution team of &quot;United States vs. Timothy McVeigh&quot;.

In 2022, Killology Research Group was renamed and rebranded to Grossman On Truth.

==Works==
Grossman&#x27;s first book, &quot;On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society&quot;, is an analysis of the psychological processes involved with killing another human being. In it, he claims that most people have a phobia-level response to violence, and that soldiers have to be specifically trained to kill. He details some of the physical effects that violent stresses produce on humans, ranging from tunnel vision, changes in sonic perception, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Robert Engen, in a paper for the &quot;Canadian Military Journal&quot; critiquing &quot;On Killing&quot;, criticized Grossman&#x27;s works, saying that &quot;although &quot;On Killing&quot; and &quot;On Combat&quot; form an excellent starting point, there are too many problems with their interpretation for them to be considered the final word on the subject.&quot; Grossman&#x27;s response to Engen, printed in the same journal, attempted to address the criticisms by arguing that SLA Marshall&#x27;s findings that man is not by nature a killer, even after having doubt cast on their methodology, have borne out in further scientific studies and real world experience, and furthermore, &quot;have been the cornerstone of military and police training for over a half century.&quot; &quot;On Killing&quot; has been cited over 3300 times, noted by Google Scholar.

In &quot;Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence&quot;, Grossman argues that the techniques used by armies to train soldiers to kill are mirrored in certain types of video games. He claims that playing violent video games, particularly light gun shooters of the first-person shooter-variety (where the player holds a weapon-like game controller), train children in the use of weapons and, more importantly, harden them emotionally to the task of murder by simulating the killing of hundreds or thousands of opponents in a single typical video game. He has repeatedly used the term &quot;murder simulator&quot; to describe first-person shooter games.

His third non-fiction book, &quot;On Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and in Peace&quot;, is an extension of his first, listing coping strategies for dealing with the physiological and psychological effects of violence for people who kill people in their line of work (soldiers and police officers).

==Criticism==
University of Nebraska criminal justice professor Samuel Walker characterized Grossman&#x27;s training as &quot;okay for Green Berets but unacceptable for domestic policing. The best police chiefs in the country don’t want anything to do with this.&quot;

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned what he termed &quot;fear-based training,&quot; a designation that included Grossman&#x27;s seminars, in 2019. A statewide ban in Minnesota was later signed into law in 2020.

<text>The town of Whangamatā is on the southeast coast of the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located 30 kilometres north of Waihi, to the north of the western extremity of the Bay of Plenty.

In holiday times the population swells considerably: New Year&#x27;s celebrations fill the town to over 25,000 though this falls soon after New Year&#x27;s Day.

A number of off-shore islands can be seen from the beach. &quot;Hauturu&quot; or Clark Island is accessible by wading at low tide and is popular in summer months for rock-pool fossickers and kayakers. &quot;Whenuakura&quot;, sometimes known as Donut Island, sits about a kilometre east of the southern part of Whangamatā beach (Otahu Beach). Tuatara roamed on Whenuakura until fairly recently. Whenuakura Island has a large collapsed blow hole which has formed a small beach inside the island – hence the alternative name.

The town has two ocean beaches, both of which are extremely safe for swimming and surfing. There is a safe boating harbour at the North end of the town and another estuary at the South end. 15 minutes drive south of Whangamatā is the quietly popular beach Whiritoa. Other beaches just north of Whangamatā are Onemana and Opoutere.

==Place name==

The Māori name &#x27;Whangamatā&#x27; comes from the words &#x27;whanga&#x27;, which means bay, and &#x27;matā&#x27;, which means a hard stone, in reference to the obsidian which washes up on the beach.

A controversial marina has been constructed on the Whangamatā estuary. An Environment Court hearing stipulated that the marina could go ahead as long as certain conditions were met. Chris Carter, a former Minister of Conservation, blocked the development but his decision was judicially reviewed by the marina developers.

The decision was sent back to Conservation Minister Chris Carter, who stated that in the interests of transparency he would then give the final decision to Environment Minister David Benson-Pope, who allowed the marina to go ahead provided that strict conditions were met regarding containment of dredged materials during construction and monitoring of the surf break at the estuary&#x27;s entrance. The marina opened in November 2009.

<doc id="1178792" wikidata="Q4774248" url="?curid=1178792" title="Anti-Pearlman Permanent Poster League">
<text>The Anti-Permanent Pearlman Poster League of the East (APPPLE) was an early (1979-1984) example of grass-roots political satire performed to generate media coverage. It employed tactics now known as culture jamming and guerilla communication.

==History==
The group was founded to protest Al Pearlman, a Philadelphia councilman in the 1970s and 1980s. Pearlman had a habit of campaigning through masonite signs, 2x4 feet, nailed to telephone poles fifteen feet off the ground; though required by law, these were not removed after elections, and some stayed up for several elections and were simply modified from one election to the next. The group argued, in a 1979 call to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that explained the first poster, that Pearlman should pay rent for the signs.

The Pearlman posters featured pictures of Pearlman, which the Anti-Pearlman Permanent Poster League would decorate with creative new designs in the broad daylight wearing white coveralls with a large apple on the back. They would often call Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Clark DeLeon prior to the redesign jobs who would month after month reveal their latest exploits to his readers with stories and pictures. Most of the posters were removed by Pearlman&#x27;s people within days of the changes.

<text>The Kalibo Santo Niño—Ati-Atihan Festival, also simply called Ati-Atihan Festival, is a Philippine festival held annually in January in honor of the Santo Niño (Holy Child or Infant Jesus) in several towns of the province of Aklan, Panay Island. The biggest celebration is held during the third Sunday of January in the town of Kalibo, the province&#x27;s capital. The name &quot;Ati-Atihan&quot; means &quot;to imitate the Ati people&quot;.

The festival consists of religious processions and street-parades, showcasing themed floats, dancing groups wearing colorful costumes, marching bands, and people sporting face and body paints. The street parade is known as &quot;Sadsad&quot;, which is also what the locals call their way of dancing where the foot is momentarily dragged along the ground in tune to the beat played by the marching bands.

Being believed to be the oldest festival in the Philippines and having inspired other popular Philippine festivals such as Dinagyang of Iloilo and Sinulog of Cebu, it is regarded as the &#x27;Mother of All Philippine Festivals.&#x27;

== History ==

The origins of the Ati-Atihan celebration date back to 1212 AD, after a group of 10 Malay chieftains called ‘Datus’ fleeing from the island of Borneo settled on the island of Panay in the Philippines and were granted settlement by the Ati people. The celebration with a relation to &quot;Santo Niño&quot; known as the &quot;Fiesta de Santo Niño&quot;, dates back to at least the 17th century. It was part of the Catholic &quot;fiesta system&quot; employed by the Spanish colonial government to reinforce the &quot;reducciones&quot; policy that aimed to resettle natives on planned settlements built around a local church. In the 1950s, the festival, along with similar fiestas around the country celebrating the Santo Niño (like the Sinulog and Dinagyang) increasingly began to resemble the Brazilian Carnival and the New Orleans Mardi Gras, incorporating music, street dancing, and body painting. By the 1960s, the festival became even more commercialized as the Philippine Department of Tourism heavily promoted local festivals to national prominence. The festival now included elaborate exotic costumes (inspired by tribal attire from Papua New Guinea, Africa, and India). It culminated in 1972, when the festival&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Ati-Atihan&quot;.

The festivity is claimed to be originally a native animist celebration of the &quot;anito&quot; (ancestor spirits), to which Spanish missionaries gradually added a Christian meaning. The festival is also linked to the epic &quot;Maragtas&quot;. The epic claims that a group of 10 Malay chieftains, led by Datu Puti, fled the island of Borneo in the 13th century and landed on the island of Panay. Datu Puti made a trade with the Ati people and purchased the lowlands for a golden &quot;salakot&quot;, brass basins and bales of cloth. They gave a very long necklace to the wife of the Ati chieftain. Feasting and festivities followed soon after. Some time later, the Ati people were struggling with famine as the result of a bad harvest. They were forced to descend from their mountain village into the settlement below, to seek the generosity of the people who now lived there. The &quot;datu&quot; obliged and gave them food. In return, the Ati danced and sang for them, grateful for the gifts they had been given.

However, the historicity of the &quot;Maragtas&quot; epic is now questioned by modern historians, despite being once widely included in school textbooks and associated with the Ati-Atihan Festival. The claim of its origins from the &quot;Maragtas&quot; or the Ati people is a modern addition, like its name.
In 2012, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the ICHCAP of UNESCO published &quot;Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot;. The first edition of the UNESCO-backed book included the &quot;Ati-atihan Festival&quot;, signifying its great importance to Philippine intangible cultural heritage. The local government of Aklan, in cooperation with the NCCA, is given the right to nominate the Ati-atihan Festival in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

== Events ==

The formal opening mass during the first day of the celebration emphasizes the festival&#x27;s religious event. The mass is followed by a procession accompanied by rhythmic drumbeats and dance parades along the street. The second day begins at dawn with a rosary procession and ends with a community mass and another dance parade. The highlight of the festival occurs on the last day, the third Sunday of January, when groups representing different tribes compete for tourists&#x27; attention and prizes. The festival ends with a procession of thousands of people carrying different kinds of images of the Santo Niño.

== Celebrations in other places ==
Other towns in Aklan that celebrate the Ati-Atihan festival are Ibajay, Lezo, Malinao, Makato, Batan, Altavas, and Malay (Boracay Island). Several nearby towns of Antique and Capiz also hold the Ati-Atihan festival.

Other festivals held in the region with similar themes include the Dinagyang of Iloilo, the Halaran of Capiz, and the Binirayan of Antique.

==Controversies==
The initial Ati-Atihan is believed to not originally include the Ati people (commonly misidentified with the Aeta people of Luzon) in the dances as the dancers were traditionally non-Ati natives who danced to give their gratitude towards the Ati people after the Ati welcomed them to the Ati homelands. In later years, Ati people also participated in the dance. The use of blackface continues to be a topic of discussion. Currently, no documentation exists to disprove that the coloring of the face and body of non-natives in the Ati-Atihan festival constitutes blackface. The use of blackface has been contested for its alleged traditional significance because there is no historical evidence to confirm it as an original part of the practice. It has also not been proven to be accepted by the Ati people, in consensus, as a means of honoring them. Some articles regarding the Ati-Atihan festival have misconstrued its purpose to &quot;honor&quot; the Ati people when, in fact, it is stated: &quot;performers of the Ati-Atihan Festival wear black soot to pretend to as Atis, dark-skinned indigenous peoples, who historians believed to be the first inhabitants of the Philippines. The celebration also honors the Sto. Niño or the Child Jesus.&quot; The article by Catalina Ricci S. Madarang has been previously misconstrued to mean they &quot;honor&quot; the Ati people via blackface when in fact it was done to mimic their appearance and in addition the festival was done to &quot;honor&quot; Santo Nino.

<text>Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) is a public agricultural university in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. It was founded in 1961 by the Pakistani government as East Pakistan Agricultural University. It is the third-oldest university in the country.

Its campus covers on the west bank of the Old Brahmaputra River. Its academic activities take place under six faculties, which are subdivided into 45 departments. More than 90% of its funding comes from the national government.

As of 2024, BAU has over 5,000 undergraduate and nearly 3,000 post-graduate students. Alumni include academics, government officials, politicians, and recipients of the Ekushey Padak.

==History==
===Pakistan period===
The Pakistani government set up the Commission on National Education at the end of 1958 to propose how to reorganise the country&#x27;s education system. One recommendation in the commission&#x27;s 1959 report was to set up an agricultural university in East Pakistan. There was already the East Pakistan College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry in Mymensingh. The government chose to upgrade the college to East Pakistan Agricultural University. On 18 August 1961, the government did so by promulgating the East Pakistan Agricultural University Ordinance, 1961. Soil scientist M Osman Ghani was appointed the university&#x27;s first vice-chancellor on 2 September 1961.

The university started with 30 teachers and 444 students. There were 23 departments under 2 faculties, the Faculty of Agriculture and the Faculty of Veterinary Science. The Faculty of Animal Husbandry was added in 1962.

In February 1963, Ghani left to become vice-chancellor of the University of Dacca. S.D. Chaudhuri took over from him at the agricultural university. The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology was added in 1963. It was followed by the Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology in 1964. A sixth faculty was started in 1967, the Faculty of Fisheries.

Architect Paul Rudolph was commissioned in 1965 to design a master plan that would remake the former college campus for the university. Construction of the major buildings that were part of this project would continue for a decade.

Students at the university were politically active in the 1969 East Pakistan mass uprising. They boycotted classes on 23 January in response to police firing on students in Dacca. In Mymensingh, on 24 January, two people were killed by police firing and 20 were wounded on the picket lines. Police and troops from the East Pakistan Rifles entered the campus on 29 January, searching the residential quarters for &quot;miscreants&quot;. On 10 February, students marched in protest. In the face of unrelenting countrywide disturbances, on 21 February, President Ayub Khan announced that he would not seek reelection. The next day, the government dropped all charges against opposition leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the others accused in the Agartala Conspiracy Case.
Biochemist Kamaluddin Ahmad became the vice-chancellor in 1969. Also that year, the central library, designed by Richard J. Neutra, opened.

Faculty, staff, and students of the university fought for independence during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. One teacher, six employees, and eleven students died in the war.

===After independence===
In 1972, the university was renamed Bangladesh Agricultural University. When Bangladesh won its independence, there were only six universities in the country. BAU was the third-oldest and the only agricultural one.

The Agricultural Museum, the country&#x27;s first, was established in 2007.

During the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement, students rallied, marched, and repeatedly blockaded the Dhaka-Mymensingh railway tracks for hours at a time.

==Campus==
BAU&#x27;s campus is in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, southeast of the city center. It is bounded on the east by the Old Brahmaputra River. The master campus plan and key buildings were designed by modernist architect Paul Rudolph.

A palm-lined east–west avenue divides the main academic and administrative buildings to its north from mostly residential and recreational facilities to its south. At its east end is BAU&#x27;s Shaheed Minar, memorializing those killed during the 1952 Bengali language movement. Nearby is a 2000 sculpture by Shaymol Chowdhury of three standing figures called Bijoy &#x27;71. It pays tribute to the sacrifices made during the Bangladesh Liberation War.
Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Auditorium has a capacity of nearly 2,000. It is used for cultural programmes. The Teacher Students Centre (TSC) is intended to be a focal point of student life and extra-curricular activities. It has dining facilities, newspaper reading rooms, and other common areas. It contains the offices of such student organisations as the debating, drama, and music societies.

The Botanical Garden is set on on the bank of the Old Brahmaputra River. As of 2025, it contains 1,500 species, representing about 300 genera and 200 families. The garden is divided into 30 zones by plant type, and includes rock gardens, water gardens, and an orchid house. The Department of Crop Botany manages the garden. The university operates the Agriculture Museum. Opened in 2007, it is the first of its kind in the country and has a collection of approximately 500 agricultural implements. The Fish Museum &amp; Biodiversity Centre was founded in 2009 by Stirling University in a building donated by BAU. It has a collection of riverine species from Bangladesh. BAU also operates ten major farms, including dairy and poultry ones.

In addition to the university&#x27;s institutes and centres, the campus is home to two national research institutes: Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) and Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI).

===Libraries===

The library was originally located in one room of the administration building. It contained just 5,000 volumes taken over from the East Pakistan College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry. Since 1969, the central library has been housed in a purpose-built modernist building designed by architect Richard J. Neutra. Originally two-storied, in 2001 it underwent an expansion that added a third story, bringing its size to . As of 2025, the library holds 185,000 volumes and 2,000 periodicals, as well as dissertations, microforms, and audiovisual items. The Faculty of Agricultural Economics &amp; Rural Sociology has its own library.

===Halls of residence (student dormitories)===
As of 2024, BAU has fourteen gender-segregated halls of residence. Nine are for men: Ashraful Haque Hall, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Hall, Fazlul Haque Hall, Hossain Shaheed Suhrawardy Hall, Isha Khan Hall, Shaheed Nazmul Ahsan Hall, Shaheed Shamsul Haque Hall, Shaheed Jamal Hossain Hall, and Shahjalal Hall. Three of these are named after fighters for independence who were killed during the Bangladesh Liberation War and are termed &quot;shaheed&quot; (martyrs).

Five halls are for women: Begum Rokeya Hall, July 36 Hall, Krishi Kanya Hall, Sultana Razia Hall, and Taposhi Rabeya Hall. The two newest were previously named in honour of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her late sister-in-law, Rosy Jamal. The latter was renamed Krishi Kanya Hall in January 2025. As of 2025, the former is shown on BAU&#x27;s website as July 36 Hall, a reference to 5 August 2024, the day the Student–People&#x27;s uprising forced Sheikh Hasina to resign.

There is also a dormitory for PhD students.

==Administration==
The university is governed by the statutes put in place by the East Pakistan Agricultural University Ordinance, 1961, and subsequently amended by the governments of East Pakistan and Bangladesh. The President of Bangladesh or their designate is the chancellor of the university, and appoints the vice chancellor. The vice-chancellor is the chief executive officer of the university. In September 2024, A K Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan became the vice-chancellor.


===Finances===
The University Grants Commission (UGC) funds more than 90% of the university&#x27;s recurring budget and all of its capital projects.

==Academics==
BAU&#x27;s academic year runs from July to June. It operates on a semester system. It offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. The university is accredited by the UGC.

===Reputation and rankings===
The 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global University Ranking placed BAU 5th among 5 in Bangladesh and tied for 1775th in the world. The July 2024 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities placed BAU 9th out of 170 in Bangladesh and 2323rd in the world. BAU was ranked 1001–1200 globally in the 2025 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;.

==Admissions and costs==
Admission requires a Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or foreign equivalent and an entrance exam.
Starting in 2019, all public agricultural universities adopted a cluster system for undergraduate admissions. Under the system, an annual integrated entry exam takes place simultaneously at multiple locations around the country. In October 2024, 51,836 candidates sat the exam for 3,718 available seats. Of those, 1,116 seats were at BAU, with the remainder spread among the other public universities offering agricultural degrees. After the exam, BAU&#x27;s academic council decided to pull the university out of the cluster admissions system. At the request of the Ministry of Education, the university agreed to continue with the cluster system for the 2024–2025 academic year to avoid confusion and disruption.

BAU charges admission and residential hall fees, plus variable fees for each semester. There are different fees at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and different ones for international students.

==Publications==
The &quot;Journal of the Bangladesh Agricultural University&quot; is published on behalf of the Bangladesh Agricultural University Research System. It is a peer-reviewed, open access journal, published quarterly. It accepts original research articles and review articles on all fields of agricultural science. The first volume was published in 2003.

<text>Robert Durden Inglis Sr. (born October 11, 1959) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 1999 and again from 2005 to 2011. He is a moderate member of the Republican Party. Inglis was unseated in the Republican primary runoff in 2010 after losing to Trey Gowdy by a landslide.

In 2012, Inglis launched the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, a nationwide public engagement campaign promoting conservative and free-enterprise solutions to energy and climate challenges. E&amp;EI is based in George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and attempts to build support for energy policies that are dictated by conservative concepts of limited government, big business, accountability, reasonable risk-avoidance, and free enterprise capitalism.

==Early life, education, and law career==

Inglis was born in Savannah, Georgia, the son of Helen Louise (née McCullough) and Allick Wyllie Inglis Jr. His ancestry is Scottish and English. He grew up in Bluffton, South Carolina, near Hilton Head Island. He earned his undergraduate degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. He obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia. Upon his graduation from law school, he worked for a number of years as a lawyer in private practice, and served on the executive committee of the Greenville County Republican Party. In 2015, he signed an amicus brief calling for the recognition of same-sex marriage.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1992
Inglis made his first run for elected office when he won the Republican nomination for the 4th District. In the general election, he defeated three-term incumbent Democrat Liz J. Patterson, who had earlier defeated Bill Workman and Knox H. White, two Republicans who were successive mayors of Greenville, with White still in the position. In this election, incumbent President George H. W. Bush carried the state with 48% of the vote, although he lost nationally, and South Carolina&#x27;s majority of voters made it one of the strongest Republican-voting states. Although the 4th District had been trending Republican for some time, Patterson had deep family ties in the district as the daughter of the late, longtime U.S. Senator Olin D. Johnston. Additionally, she had won her first three terms under unfriendly conditions for Democrats.

;1994–1996
Proving just how Republican this district had become, Inglis was re-elected in 1994 and 1996 with no substantive opposition, both times winning more than 70 percent of the vote.

;1998
Inglis had promised during his initial bid for the seat to serve only three terms. Accordingly, he vacated the seat in 1998 to run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Ernest Hollings, who had been in office since 1966, as successor to Olin Johnston. Inglis gave Hollings his third close race in a row, holding the longtime Senator to 53 percent of the vote. After losing the race, Inglis returned to work as a lawyer, practicing commercial real estate and corporate law. He was succeeded in the House by Jim DeMint, who had been an informal adviser to Inglis.

;2004
In 2004, DeMint opted to run for Hollings&#x27;s open Senate seat instead of seeking re-election to the House. Inglis chose to try for his old House seat. He easily won a three-way Republican primary with 85 percent of the vote, all but assuring his return to Congress. He faced the founder of the HBCU Classic and first African American Democratic candidate to run for the 4th District seat, Brandon P. Brown from Taylors, in the general election. Inglis was re-elected with little difficulty in 2006 and 2008.

;2010

Inglis faced four challengers in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. It was the first time he faced substantive primary opposition as an incumbent. The challengers included 7th Circuit (Spartanburg) Solicitor Trey Gowdy, state Senator David L. Thomas, college professor and former Historian of the U.S. House Christina Jeffrey, and businessman Jim Lee.

In the June 8, 2010, primary election, Inglis finished second with 27 percent of the vote, well behind first-place finisher Gowdy&#x27;s 39 percent. Inglis was forced into a June 22 run-off election against Gowdy. Although he had &quot;racked up a reliably conservative record&quot; during his six terms in the House, Inglis had been criticized by his primary opponents for certain votes, including his support for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (which earned him the nickname &quot;Bailout Bob&quot;) and his opposition to the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, and was portrayed as removed from the interests of the district. Inglis had attacked Gowdy&#x27;s conservatism and questioned his opponent&#x27;s support for creating a costly lake in Union County, South Carolina.

In the runoff, Gowdy defeated Inglis in a landslide, 71–29 percent. Following his defeat in the Republican primary, Inglis criticized the Tea Party movement, which had supported his opponent&#x27;s campaign, as well as the Republican Party for courting the movement, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a dangerous strategy, to build conservatism on information and policies that are not credible.&quot;

===Tenure===
Inglis&#x27;s 2010 Republican primary opponents asserted that his voting record in his second House tenure was more moderate than his first. He was one of seventeen House Republicans who voted for a Democratic resolution opposing the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, and spoke against climate change denial, offshore oil drilling and warrantless surveillance after his return to the House. In response, Inglis pointed to his 93.5% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union and his endorsements from the NRA Political Victory Fund and National Right to Life Committee.

On climate change, Inglis said that conservatives should go with the facts, and the science, and accept the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; conclusion that climate change is caused by human activities and poses significant risks, which 97 percent of climate scientists agree with. Studies conclude that coal power plants are responsible for 23,600 premature deaths in the U.S. per year, and conservatives should hold them accountable, he said, perhaps with a carbon tax on their emissions.

Inglis is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. He also supported actions to aid people in war-torn Darfur. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. On December 27, 2008, Inglis published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in support of a revenue neutral carbon tax.

In October 2007, before the South Carolina 2008 Republican presidential primary, Inglis told presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Mormon, &quot;[Y]ou cannot equate Mormonism with Christianity; you cannot say, &#x27;I am a Christian just like you.&#x27;&quot; Inglis stated &quot;If he [Romney] does that, every Baptist preacher in the South is going to have to go to the pulpit on Sunday and explain the differences.&quot;

On September 15, 2009, Inglis was one of seven Republicans to cross party lines in voting to disapprove fellow South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson for a lack of decorum during President Obama&#x27;s address to a joint session of Congress. He was one of eight House Republicans to support the DREAM Act.

==Awards and honors==
Inglis was the recipient of the 2015 Profile in Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation &quot;for the courage he demonstrated when reversing his position on climate change after extensive briefings with scientists, and discussions with his children, about the impact of atmospheric warming on our future.&quot; His embrace of the scientific evidence of climate change and advocacy for a carbon tax drew intense criticism from fellow Republicans, and Inglis was defeated in the June 2010 Republican primary. He &quot;figures prominently&quot; in the 2014 &quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot; documentary as an interviewee exposing the methods of science deniers.

On October 2, 2023, Inglis wrote a strong Op-Ed in the New York Times urging his fellow Republicans to consider the long range consequences of their votes, and arguing that when they &quot;grow up&quot; and look back on their careers they will ask themselves &quot;Was I an agent of chaos in a house divided, or did I work to bring America together, healing rifts and bridging divides?&quot; 

==Personal life==
Inglis and his wife Mary Anne have five grown children, and they live on a small farm near Travelers Rest, north of Greenville. He is a member of St. John in the Wilderness, an Episcopal congregation in Flat Rock, NC.

==Opposition to Donald Trump==
In October 2016, Inglis was one of thirty GOP ex-lawmakers to sign a public letter condemning Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He had previously said, in a May 2016 interview with Chris Hayes, that &quot;under no circumstances&quot; could he vote for Trump. Commenting on Trump&#x27;s campaign after the election, Inglis said: &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to represent people and give a voice to their fears. It is quite another to amplify those fears—that is surely the worst possible kind of leadership. It&#x27;s demagoguery. The real sadness for me is that we knew it, and yet we voted for it. In a very real sense, the whole country has lost this election.&quot;

Six months later, after House Speaker Paul Ryan accused Democrats of partisan bias in calling for Trump&#x27;s impeachment over the firing of FBI director James Comey, then investigating possible links between Trump&#x27;s campaign and Russia, Inglis chastised Ryan on Twitter, saying, &quot;you know this isn&#x27;t true&quot; since Republicans would have had, in his opinion, ample grounds for considering impeachment if a Democratic president had done the things Trump was accused of. Reminded that he had, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, he said that was &quot;for matters less serious than the ones before us now.&quot;

In 2024, Inglis endorsed Kamala Harris over Trump in the presidential election. According to him, if Harris wins, it would be great for the Republican Party, restoring its rationality to be the credible free enterprise, small government party again

<text>The Hofstad Network (Dutch: &quot;Hofstadnetwerk&quot; or &quot;Hofstadgroep&quot;) was an Islamic terror group composed mostly of Dutch citizens, and mainly young men between the ages of 18 and 32. The name &quot;Hofstad&quot; was originally the codename the Dutch secret service AIVD used for the network and leaked to the media. The name likely refers to the nickname of the city of The Hague, where some of the suspected terrorists lived. The network was active throughout the 2000s.

The group was made up of Muslim immigrants living in the Netherlands, second and third generation immigrants to the Netherlands, and Dutch converts. The majority of these immigrants came from Morocco.

The network was said to have links to networks in Spain and Belgium. Among their contacts was Abdeladim Akoudad, also known as Naoufel, one of the suspects of the 2003 Casablanca bombings. The group was influenced by the ideology of Takfir wal-Hijra, a militant offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Redouan al-Issar, also known as &quot;The Syrian&quot;, was the suspected spiritual leader of the group. Most media attention was attracted by Mohammed Bouyeri, sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering film director Theo van Gogh in 2004 and by Samir Azzouz, suspected of planning terrorist attacks on the Dutch parliament and several strategic targets such as the national airport and a nuclear reactor. The group was also suspected of planning to kill several members of government and parliament.

==History==
In 2002, the Hofstad group was discovered by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD). The intelligence gathered in the first years after the group was discovered was limited, revealing that the group had only been meeting together. These were informal living-room meetings held by a Syrian asylum-seeker. By the end of 2002, the AIVD began to suspect that the organization was developing extremist views and discussing mass casualty events.

On 14 October 2003, Samir Azzouz, Ismail Akhnikh, Jason Walters and Redouan al-Issar were put under arrest for planning a (according to the AIVD) &quot;terrorist attack in the Netherlands&quot;, but were released soon after. Azzouz was eventually tried in this case, but acquitted for lack of evidence in 2005: he did possess what he thought to be a home-made bomb, but having used the wrong type of fertilizer, the device would never have exploded.

At the beginning of 2003, a Hofstad member and his friend tried to join an Islamic rebel group in Chechnya, but were discovered by authorities and arrested. During the summer, two Hofstad group members traveled to Pakistan where they received paramilitary training. In September, the two men returned and it was discovered by authorities that these same men could be traced to having talked to a man having ties to the Casablanca bombings earlier that year. On 14 October of that year, the Spanish authorities arrested a Moroccan man who was suspected to be involved in suspicious activity. Police in the Netherlands arrested five Hofstad associates, including three who had traveled abroad and were in contact with extremists in Morocco and Syria.

In 2003, Mohammed Bouyeri, the man who murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, was radicalized. He withdrew from mainstream Dutch society by quitting his job and distancing himself from all friends and family who were non-religious. During this time, he became known as the &quot;Taliban&quot; by many in his neighborhood.

In 2004, the group was under heavy surveillance by the AIVD, which dampened the group&#x27;s activities.

On 18 May 2004, authorities received a tip that a grocery store worker had been involved in preparing for a terror attack. A couple weeks later, the Dutch secret service had arrested this man after capturing him on security cameras taking measurements of the Dutch secret service headquarters. Upon his arrest, police found maps as well as weapons that could be used to carry out the terror attacks.

On 29 August 2004, Van Gogh and Ayaan Hirsi Ali created a short film, Submission, that contained scenes of Quranic verses being painted onto semi-naked women. This was the catalyst for the group&#x27;s radicalization and Bouyeri&#x27;s justification to kill Van Gogh for the blasphemy of Islam.

== Claimed attacks ==
Theo van Gogh&#x27;s murder was the first terrorist attack claimed by the Hofstad group.

In September 2004, authorities received a tip from an email that warned of two Hofstad group members preparing a terror attack. The anonymous source also admitted to being recruited by these men to carry out the planned terrorist attacks with particular targets.

On 2 November of that year, Mohammed Bouyeri killed Van Gogh when he was on his way to work in Amsterdam. The killer cycled alongside the filmmaker before shooting him several times and attempting to decapitate him. Before fleeing the scene, he left a note pinned to Van Gogh&#x27;s chest that had a death threat for Hirsi Ali.

After the attack, Bouyeri went to a park nearby, where he had a shootout with police before being taken into custody.

Witnesses said that Bouyeri had been stalking his route for some time before the attack had happened.

After the attack, the police spent the following 10 days arresting the group members. One group member who acted as the religious teacher for the group fled the country the day of Van Gogh&#x27;s murder and entered Syria illegally.

Shortly after the murder of Van Gogh, the organization gained the attention of national media when an attempt to arrest suspected members Jason Walters and Ismail Akhnikh led to a 14-hour siege at a house in The Hague. During these events, the name &quot;Hofstad Network&quot; became public and the media has continued to use this moniker when referring to the organization. In the months after the siege, a number of other suspected members of the organization were arrested. On 5 December 2005, the Hofstad court case against 14 suspected members began.

Samir Azzouz, Jermaine Walters —suspected but not incarcerated— and another five members were arrested on suspicion of preparing an attack against (yet unnamed) national politicians and the building of the General Intelligence and Security Agency AIVD on 14 October 2005. 

In a case known as Piranha case, six individuals were brought to court, one of them was Noureddine El Fahtni. On 1 December 2006, the District Court of Rotterdam sentenced Azzouz to 8 years in prison for preparing a terrorist attack. Noureddine El Fahtni and Mohammed Chentouf to 4 years each, Soumaya Sahla to 3 years and Brahim Harhour to 3 months. One suspect was acquitted. The Court ruled that the six individuals had not formed a terrorist organization.

In appeal, the Court in The Hague convicted all defendants to more severe sentences. On 2 October 2008, Samir Azzouz was sentenced to 9 years in prison, Nouriddin El Fahtni was sentenced to 8 years, Mohammed Chentouf was sentenced to 6;6 years in prison, Soumaya Sahla was sentenced to 4 years in prison.

==Trial (Hofstad group)==
===District Court + appeal===
In 2005, fourteen alleged members of the Hofstad Network were brought to trial before the District Court in Rotterdam. During the trial, the presiding judge admitted that he felt as if it was obvious that arrest leading to the hearing had created a spectacle and that the group members ideologies were being greatly scrutinized. The lawyers who defended that group labeled the trial as a &quot;witch trial&quot;. It was clear that the ideological threat the Hofstad group had posed stirred the emotions of the public. The Court ruled that in the case of the Hofstad group there was a clear distinction between peaceful and harmful extremism. The Court acquitted four of the defendants because they showed no attempt for violence but only held extremist ideas. The Court also ruled that the group was not a terror organization.

Nadir Adarraf, Rachid Belkacem, Mohamed El Bousklaoui, Zakaria Taybi and Jermaine Walters were acquitted and set free. On 7 November 2006 the District Court in Rotterdam awarded them compensation (in total € 300.182,04). 

Seven cases have been appealed to the Court of Appeal in The Hague. On 23 January 2008, the Court of Appeal acquitted those convicted in the first instance of participation in a criminal organization. According to the Court of Appeal, the Hofstad Group had insufficient organizational substance to conclude that there was an organization as referred to in Articles 140 and 140a of the Criminal Code. The court ruled that the cooperation of the suspects was not sufficiently structured to justify their conviction. In the opinion of the court, there was also no question of incitement to hatred. The Court ruled that the legislator only intended to criminalize incitement to hatred against vulnerable minority groups.

The Court has sentenced one of the defendants, Jason Walters, to a prison term of 15 years for the attempted murder of members of an arrest team of the police in The Hague and possession of hand grenades. A second suspect, Ismail Akhnikh, was sentenced to 15 months in prison for complicity in possession of hand grenades.

===Supreme Court + back===
The Public Prosecution Service lodged an appeal in cassation against the judgments of the Court. Jason Walters also lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction (08/00695).

On 2 February 2010, the Supreme Court quashed the contested judgments and referred the cases to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal.

On 17 December 2010, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal sentenced Mohamed El Morabit, Yousef Ettoumi, Ahmed Hamdi, Mohamed Fahmi Boughabe and Nouredine el Fahtni to prison terms of 15 months, for participating in a terrorist criminal organization.

Ismail Akhnikh and Jason Walters were guilty also of possessing four hand grenades. Ismail Akhnikh was sentenced to 38 months. Jason Walters, who had thrown a shrapnel grenade in the direction of the arrest team in accordance with a predetermined plan, was sentenced to 13 years in prison on five counts of attempted murder. Upon the ruling, the court determined that the Hofstad group was a terror criminal organization who had the intent of committing crimes out of violence and hatred.

== Court rulings ==
After their acquittal on 10 March 2006, the five former suspects requested compensation as referred to in Article 89 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 7 November 2006, the District Court of Rotterdam (Raadkamer) decided on their requests.

==VARA==
On 18 May 2006, a group of four young men delivered flowers to the Dutch public broadcaster VARA. The flowers included a note, &quot;greetings, the Hofstadgroup,&quot; which was a &#x27;thank you&#x27; for the VARA &quot;Zembla&quot; documentary broadcast the week prior, on the topic of Ayaan Hirsi Ali&#x27;s asylum background. Jermaine Walters was said to be one of the men.

<doc id="1178825" wikidata="Q264241" url="?curid=1178825" title="Gorgias (dialogue)">
<text>Gorgias (; ) is a Socratic dialogue written by Plato around 380 BC. The dialogue depicts a conversation between Socrates and a small group at a dinner gathering. Socrates debates with self-proclaimed rhetoricians seeking the true definition of rhetoric, attempting to pinpoint the essence of rhetoric and unveil the flaws of the sophistic oratory popular in Athens at the time. The art of persuasion was widely considered necessary for political and legal advantage in classical Athens, and rhetoricians promoted themselves as teachers of this fundamental skill. Some, like Gorgias, were foreigners attracted to Athens because of its reputation for intellectual and cultural sophistication. Socrates suggests that he (Socrates) is one of the few Athenians to practice true politics (521d).

==Dramatis personae==

* Socrates
* Gorgias
* Polus
* Callicles
* Chaerephon

==Major themes==

===Definition of rhetoric===
Socrates interrogates Gorgias to determine the true definition of rhetoric, framing his argument in the question format, &quot;What is X?&quot; (2). He asks, &quot;… why don’t you tell us yourself what the craft you’re an expert in is, and hence what we’re supposed to call you?&quot; (449e).

Throughout the remainder of the dialogue, Socrates debates about the nature of rhetoric. Although rhetoric has the potential to be used justly, Socrates believes that in practice, rhetoric is flattery; the rhetorician makes the audience feel worthy because they can identify with the rhetorician’s argument.

===The question of &quot;techne&quot;: art vs. knack===
Socrates and Polus debate whether rhetoric can be considered an art. Polus states that rhetoric is indeed a craft, but Socrates replies, &quot;To tell you the truth, Polus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a craft at all&quot; (462b). The dialogue continues:

&quot;POLUS: So you think oratory&#x27;s a knack?

&quot;SOCRATES: Yes, I do, unless you say it&#x27;s something else.

&quot;POLUS: A knack for what?

&quot;SOCRATES: For producing a certain gratification and pleasure.&quot; (462c)

Socrates continues to argue that rhetoric is not an art, but merely a knack that &quot;guesses at what&#x27;s pleasant with no consideration for what&#x27;s best. And I say that it isn&#x27;t a craft, but a knack, because it has no account of the nature of whatever things it applies by which it applies them, so that it&#x27;s unable to state the cause of each thing&quot; (465a).

===The morality of rhetoric===
Socrates discusses the morality of rhetoric with Gorgias, asking him if rhetoric was just. Socrates catches the incongruity in Gorgias&#x27; statements: &quot;well, at the time you said that, I took it that oratory would never be an unjust thing, since it always makes its speeches about justice. But when a little later you were saying that the orator could also use oratory unjustly, I was surprised and thought that your statements weren&#x27;t consistent&quot; (461a). To this argument, Gorgias &quot;… is left wishing he could respond, knowing he cannot, and feeling frustrated and competitive. The effect of the &#x27;proof&#x27; is not to persuade, but to disorient him&quot;.

Socrates believes that rhetoric alone is not a moral endeavour. Gorgias is criticised because, &quot;he would teach anyone who came to him wanting to learn oratory but without expertise in what&#x27;s just …&quot; (482d). Socrates believes that people need philosophy to teach them what is right, and that oratory cannot be righteous without philosophy.

===Truth===
Socrates continually claims that his methods of questioning are aimed at discovering the truth. He sarcastically compliments Callicles on his frankness because it helps expose the truth about oratory: &quot;I well know that if you concur with what my soul believes, then that is the very truth. I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.&quot; (487a). Truth can be found through deliberation with others, relaying to one another the knowledge in one&#x27;s soul to come to a conclusion about each other&#x27;s beliefs.

At the same time, truth is not based upon commonly accepted beliefs. Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: &quot;you don&#x27;t compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. For my part, if I don&#x27;t produce you as a single witness to agree with what I&#x27;m saying, then I suppose I&#x27;ve achieved nothing worth mentioning concerning the things we’ve been discussing&quot; (472c).

==Summary==

===Introduction (447a–449c)===
The dialogue begins just after Gorgias has given a speech. Callicles says that Gorgias is a guest in his home, and has agreed to a private audience with Socrates and his friend Chaerephon. Socrates gets Gorgias to agree to his cross-examination style of conversation. Gorgias identifies his craft as rhetoric, and affirms that he should be called a rhetorician. As Socrates asks him questions, he praises him for the brevity of his replies. Gorgias remarks that no one has asked him a new question in a long time, and when Socrates asks, he assures him that he is just as capable of brevity as of long-windedness (449c).

===Physical and intellectual combat compared (449d–458c)===
Gorgias admits under Socrates&#x27; cross-examination that while rhetoricians give people the power of words, they are not instructors of morality. Gorgias does not deny that his students might use their skills for immoral purposes (such as persuading the assembly to make an unwise decision, or to let a guilty man go free), but he says the teacher cannot be held responsible for this. He makes an argument from analogy: Gorgias says that if a man who went to wrestling school took to thrashing his parents or friends, you would not send his drill instructor into exile (456d–457c). He says that just as the trainer teaches his craft (&quot;techne&quot;) in good faith, and hopes that his student will use his physical powers wisely, the rhetorician has the same trust, that his students will not abuse their power.

Socrates says that he is one of those people who is actually happy to be refuted if he is wrong. He says that he would rather be refuted than to refute someone else because it is better to be delivered from harm oneself than to deliver someone else from harm. Gorgias, whose profession is persuasion, readily agrees that he is also this sort of man, who would rather be refuted than refute another. Gorgias has only one misgiving: he fears that the present company may have something better to do than listen to two men try to outdo each other in being wrong (458b–c). The company protests and proclaims that they are anxious to witness this new version of intellectual combat.

===The debate about rhetoric (458d–466c)===
Socrates gets Gorgias to agree that the rhetorician is actually more convincing in front of an ignorant audience than an expert, because mastery of the tools of persuasion gives a man more conviction than mere facts. Gorgias accepts this criticism and asserts that it is an advantage of his profession that a man can be considered above specialists without having to learn anything of substance (459c). Socrates calls rhetoric a form of flattery, or pandering, and compares it to pastry baking and self-adorning (&quot;kommōtikōn&quot;). He says that rhetoric is to politics what pastry baking is to medicine, and what cosmetics are to gymnastics. All of these activities are aimed at surface adornment, an impersonation of what is really good (464c–465d).

Bruce McComiskey has argued that Gorgias may have been uncharacteristically portrayed by Plato, because &quot;… Plato&#x27;s Gorgias agrees to the binary opposition knowledge vs. opinion&quot; (82). This is inaccurate because, &quot;for Gorgias the sophist, all &#x27;knowledge&#x27; is opinion. There can be no rational or irrational arguments because all human beliefs and communicative situations are relative to a kairotic moment&quot; (83).

===The pitiful tyrant (466d–481b)===
Socrates then advances that &quot;orators and tyrants have the very least power of any in our cities&quot; (466d). Lumping tyrants and rhetoricians into a single category, Socrates says that both of them, when they kill people or banish them or confiscate their property, think they are doing what is in their own best interest, but are actually pitiable. Socrates maintains that the wicked man is unhappy, but that the unhappiest man of all is the wicked one who does not meet with justice, rebuke, and punishment (472e). Polus, who has stepped into the conversation at this point, laughs at Socrates. Socrates asks him if he thinks laughing is a legitimate form of refutation (473e). Polus then asks Socrates if putting forth views that no one would accept is not a refutation in itself. Socrates replies that if Polus cannot see how to refute him, he will show Polus how.

Socrates states that it is far worse to inflict evil than to be the innocent victim of it (475e). He gives the example of tyrants being the most wretched people on earth. He adds that poverty is to financial condition as disease is to the body as injustice is to the soul (477b–c). This analogy is used to define the states of corruption in each instance. Money-making, medicine, and justice are the respective cures (478a,b). Socrates argues that just penalties discipline people, make them more just, and cure them of their evil ways (478d). Wrongdoing is second among evils, but wrongdoing and getting away with it is the first and greatest of evils (479d). It follows from this, that if a man does not want to have a festering and incurable tumour growing in his soul, he needs to hurry himself to a judge upon realising that he has done something wrong. Socrates posits that the rhetorician should accuse himself first, and then do his family and friends the favour of accusing them, so great is the curative power of justice (480c–e).

Socrates maintains that, assuming the converse of the previous argument, if your enemy has done something awful, you should contrive every means to see that he does not come before the judicial system. Polus and Callicles are both astounded at Socrates&#x27; position and wonder if he is just kidding (481b).

===Callicles criticizes philosophy (481c–505b)===
Callicles observes that if Socrates is correct, people have life upside down, and are everywhere doing the opposite of what they should be doing. Socrates says that he and Callicles share similar conditions in that he is in love with Alcibiades and philosophy, while Callicles is in love with the son of Cleinias and the Athenian Demus, and that neither can stop their beloveds from saying what is on their minds. While the statements of certain people often differ from one time to the next, Socrates claims that what philosophy says always stays the same (482b).

Callicles accuses Socrates of carrying on like a demagogue. He argues that suffering wrong is worse than doing it, that there is nothing good about being a victim. He further argues (as Glaucon does in the Gyges story in the &quot;Republic&quot;) that wrongdoing is only by convention shameful, and it is not wrong by nature. Then, he berates Socrates for wasting time in frivolous philosophy, saying there is no harm in young people engaging in useless banter, but that it is unattractive in older men. He tells Socrates that he is disgraceful, and that if anyone should seize him and carry him off to prison, he would be helpless to defend himself, saying that Socrates would reel and gape in front of a jury, and end up being put to death (486a,b). Socrates is not offended by this, and tells Callicles that his extraordinary frankness proves that he is well-disposed towards him (487d).

Callicles then returns to his defence of nature&#x27;s own justice, where the strong exercise their advantages over the weak. He states that the natural man has large appetites and the means to satisfy them, and that only a weakling praises temperance and justice based on artificial law not natural. (483b, 492a–c).

Socrates calls Callicles a &quot;desired touchstone&quot; (486) and counters that not only &quot;nomos&quot; (custom or law) but also nature affirms that to do injustice is more disgraceful than to suffer it, that equality is justice (489a–b), and that a man such as Callicles&#x27; ideal is like a leaky jar, insatiable and unhappy (494a). Socrates returns to his previous position, that an undisciplined man is unhappy and should be restrained and subjected to justice (505b).

===Socrates debates with himself (505c–509b)===
Callicles becomes exasperated at the intellectual stalemate, and invites Socrates to carry on by himself, asking and answering his own questions (505d). Socrates requests that his audience, including Callicles, listen to what he says and kindly break in on him if he says something that sounds false. If his opponent (whom he will be speaking for himself) makes a point, he agrees to concede to it (506a–c). Socrates proceeds with a monologue, and reiterates that he was not kidding about the best use of rhetoric, that it is best used against one&#x27;s own self. A man who has done something wrong is wretched, but a man who gets away with it is even worse off (509b).

===Philosophy is a bitter draught===
Socrates argues that he aims at what is best, not at what is pleasant, and that he alone understands the technique of politics. He says that he enjoins people to take the bitter draughts, and compels them to hunger and thirst, while most politicians flatter the people with sweetmeats. He also says that &quot;the body is our tomb of soul&quot; (493a) citing the words of Euripides, &quot;who knows if life be not death and death life&quot;. (492e) He says of his trial that, &quot;I shall be judged like a doctor brought before a jury of children with a cook as prosecutor&quot; (521e). He says that such a pandering prosecutor will no doubt succeed in getting him sentenced to death, and he will be helpless to stop it. Socrates says that all that matters is his own purity of soul; he has maintained this, and it is the only thing that is really within his power (522d).

===The Judgement of Naked Souls===
Socrates ends the dialogue by telling Callicles, Polus, and Gorgias a story that they regard as a myth, but he regards as true (523a). He recounts that in the old days, Cronos judged men just before they died, and divided them into two categories. He sent good and righteous men to the Isles of the Blessed, and godless, unrighteous men to the prison of vengeance and punishment called Tartarus. These cases were judged badly because the men were judged while they were alive and with their clothes on, and the judges were fooled by appearances. Zeus fixed the problem by arranging for people to be dead, and stripped naked of body and made his sons judges, Minos and Rhadamanthus from Europa and Aeacus from Aegina. (523d–524a) The judges had to be naked too, so they could scan the souls of men without distractions.

Socrates adds that he has heard this myth, believes it, and infers from it that death is the separation of body and soul. He says that each retains after death the qualities it had in life, so that a fat, long-haired man will have a fat, long-haired corpse. If he was a scoundrel, he will bear the scars of his beatings. When the judge lays hold of some potentate, he will find that his soul bears the scars of his perjuries and crimes, because these will be branded on his soul (524b–525a).

Socrates remarks that some people are benefited by the pain and agony of their own punishments (525b) and by watching others suffer excruciating torture; but others have misdeeds that cannot be cured. He says that the Odyssey by Homer pictures kings suffering eternally in Hades, but not the ordinary scoundrel, like Thersites. Socrates warns Callicles that when he is up before the judge on his own judgement day, he will reel and gape no less there than Socrates does here. He says that the story might sound like nonsense to him, like an old folk tale, and agrees there would be no wonder in despising it if a better and truer one could be found, but observes that none in the group have proved that one should live a different kind of life. Finally he exhorts them to follow him in justice and virtue.

<text>Eric Breuer is a Swiss archaeologist and historian.

He studied archaeology and history at the Universities of Munich, Vienna, Fribourg and Basel. He discovered the Roman vicus of Eriskirch (Lake Constance), and conducted widespread research on early Medieval archaeology, archaeology of Roman provinces, Avar archaeology, and Mediterranean history. His main interest was the relative chronology of Roman and early medieval times.

==Childhood and youth==

Only scarce information can be found about his childhood and youth. It seems, that he spent his early years at Munich and the Lake Constance region. Already from early ages he was interested in archaeology. At the age of 8 he discovered an ancient building at the Roman settlement of Argen by unearthening potsherds of samian ware. At the age of 13 he joined the local museum.

==Life as an archaeologist==
Already before his university studies, he was surprised about the total lack of Roman towns north of lake constance, dure to the massive density in southern region with ancient towns like Taxgaition, Constantia, Arbor felix, Ad Rhenum, Confluentes, Brigantion and Clunia. By analyzing topographical situations of already known ancient towns, he worked out a list of characteristic topographical features of Roman vici. Based on this list, Breuer did widespread archaeological surveys at lake constance region.

As a result he managed to discover an (in modern times totally unknown) Roman vicus at river Schussen near today&#x27;s village of Eriskirch, where buildings with preserved ancient wood were excavated by him. 

In 2001 Breuer discovered a slightly separated part of the settlement with pottery kilns, already lying on the eastern side of river Schussen at Mariabrunn, more than half a mile eastern the first discovered pottery area. In 2012 he managed even to localize the Roman necropolis of the first century AD of the ancient village.

Studying Claudius Ptolemaios&#x27; &quot;Geography&quot;, he stated further, that because Ptolemy didn’t realize the sharp bend of the Rhine at Basel, many Raetian towns are located by Ptolemy at the wrong position. Because also some towns like Cambodunum and Abodiacum are presented as being located much too eastern, he came to the conclusion, that there should be a big unknown ancient town called “Drusomagus” located by Ptolemy in the Lake Constance region, corresponding to the more western already known Iuliomagus. 
Beneath this study on ancient vici he did also surveys on ancient villae rusticae.

On the field of Early Medieval archaeology, Breuer published a new chronological system, based on earlier works of F. Daim and J. Zabojnik. As it seems, it is based on his thesis about chronology of the Avar cemeteries of Üllő and Janoshida. 

Contrary to early eastern European archaeologists, like I. Kovrig and others, Breuer favoured the idea that changes in ornaments and manufacturing of belts are not signs of new arriving ethnic groups in the Carpathian Basin, but simply changes of fashion and lifetime of certain processes of production of goods - and not ethnic conclusions. As a result chronological horizons get at Breuer&#x27;s work the meaning of starting, increasing, decline and end of fabrications of certain types of small findings.

<text>Dobson is a small town on the banks of the Grey River in the South Island of New Zealand. It is east from the river&#x27;s mouth at Greymouth. The settlement of Taylorville is across the river from Dobson, but no bridge directly connects the two. State Highway 7 passes through Dobson.

==History==
The town is named for the surveyor George Dobson, the second son of Edward Dobson and brother of Arthur Dudley Dobson, who was murdered at this site in 1866. He was killed in a bungled robbery by the Burgess gang, who had mistaken him for a gold buyer carrying gold from the nearby Arnold goldfield. A monument now stands where George Dobson was murdered.

Dobson was the site of one of the West Coast&#x27;s many coal mines. The Dobson mine was opened in 1919, and closed in 1968. It was the site of one of the country&#x27;s worst mining disasters. Nine men were killed in an explosion at the mine in 1926.

A hydroelectric dam was proposed for the area by TrustPower in 1999 but it failed to secure access to public land that needed to be flooded for the scheme. In 2003 Nick Smith, who was an Opposition MP at the time, attempted to remove the reserve status from the land needed for the dam reservoir in order to allow the scheme to go ahead, but was unsuccessful.

<text>Theodore Roosevelt Island is an island and national memorial located in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, it was used as a training camp for the United States Colored Troops. The island was given to the federal government by the Theodore Roosevelt Association in memory of the 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt. Until then, the island had been known as My Lord&#x27;s Island, Barbadoes Island, Mason&#x27;s Island, Analostan Island, and Anacostine Island.

The island is maintained by the National Park Service, as part of the nearby George Washington Memorial Parkway. The land is generally maintained as a natural park, with various trails and a memorial plaza featuring a statue of Roosevelt. No cars or bicycles are permitted on the island, which is reached by a footbridge from Arlington, Virginia, on the western bank of the Potomac.

According to the National Park Service: &quot;In the 1930s landscape architects transformed Mason’s Island from neglected, overgrown farmland into Theodore Roosevelt Island, a memorial to America’s 26th president. They conceived a &#x27;real forest&#x27; designed to mimic the natural forest that once covered the island. Today miles of trails through wooded uplands and swampy bottomlands honor the legacy of a great outdoorsman and conservationist.&quot;

A small island, Little Island, lies just off the southern tip; Georgetown and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts are respectively across the main channel of the Potomac to the north and the east.

==History==
===Early history===
The Nacotchtank Indians, formerly of what is now Anacostia (in Washington, D.C.), temporarily moved to the island in 1668, giving its first recorded name, &quot;Anacostine&quot;. The island was patented in 1682 as Anacostine Island by Captain Randolph Brandt (or Brunett), who left the island to his daughter Margaret Hammersley, upon his death in 1698 or 1699. Historical records indicate that the Nacotchtank were living on the island in 1711, but by 1751 they went unmentioned and appeared to be a &quot;lost tribe&quot;, likely having merged with nearby tribes such as the Piscataway.

===Mason, Carter, and Bradley families===
The island was acquired by George Mason III in 1724. George Mason IV (then underage) inherited the island in 1735 upon the death of his father, and a ferry from the Virginia shore across the Potomac to Georgetown (the &quot;Little River&quot; and mouth of Rock Creek) was moved from Awbrey&#x27;s land to Mason&#x27;s island in 1748. His son and executor John Mason, inherited the island as the century ended, pursuant to a 1773 will presented to the Fairfax County Circuit court in 1792 by his brother George Mason V, who died in 1796 so he and his other living brother, Thomas Mason, succeeded as their father&#x27;s executors.
John Mason built a mansion on the island around 1796 and planted crops for sale as well as gardens. The home was built and estate maintained with free black and slave labor. He was an active member of the Agricultural Society of Georgetown and the Columbia Agricultural Society of Washington, and able to manufacture almost everything needed for home consumption (including cotton) on the island. He also entertained lavishly on the island, including a 1798 party to honor then-uncrowned Louis Philippe I, and an 1811 fete for his son John Murray Mason before he left to study in Paris. In 1809 John Mason secured a charter for a turnpike to connect his ferry landing with the Washington-Alexandria turnpike that Congress had chartered the previous year (and which would follow what became U.S. Route 1 and compete with his ferry for traffic). John Mason also diversified his income-producing activities, operating a ferry between Georgetown and the Virginia shore until construction of the Aqueduct Bridge in 1843 (superseded by the Key Bridge in 1923), as well as from 1817 until 1838 serving as the last president of the Potowmack Company (founded in 1774 with George Washington as its first President and in order to deepen the Potomac&#x27;s channel and build locks around the principal falls).

Using federal funds and private funds raised by Georgetown merchants, a causeway from the Virginia shore to the island was constructed after debris from flooding in the winter of 1784 changed the Potomac River&#x27;s main channel from the island&#x27;s western side to the eastern side and increased silt which threatened the nearby Georgetown port. Alexandria merchants objected to the causeway and it proved a sticking point in their calls for retrocession of 26 square miles of land Virginia had given to establish the federal city as the century began. The first retrocession attempt was in 1804, and another major failed attempt occurred in 1824. However, by 1831, water stagnation caused the Mason family to move from the island. (Through his ownership, John Mason, who opposed retrocession, also had a Georgetown residence at the corner of 25th Street, L Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, which became the site of Columbia Hospital in 1932). In 1842, then elderly John Mason sold the island to John Carter. Four years later, Congress left retrocession to a referendum, which President James K. Polk authorized and Alexandria voters endorsed by a 763 to 222 vote on September 1, 1846 (despite opposition from the northern areas). After a further year of Congressional and Virginia General Assembly negotiations, the island became part of Alexandria County (the northern portion later separated from the City of Alexandria and was renamed Arlington County). After Carter died in 1851, the island passed to William A. Bradley. Nonetheless, in 1854, the island again hosted an entertainment, this time given by the late John Mason&#x27;s daughter Anna Maria (who had married Sydney Smith Lee in 1834) to mark a treaty opening Japan to foreign trade (Captain Lee having served under Commodore Matthew C. Perry on the voyage which resulted in the treaty).

===American Civil War===


In 1861, Alexandria County had about 10,000 residents, three-quarters of whom lived in the city portion, and about half of those in the country portion were enslaved or &quot;free colored&quot;. Union forces occupied the island, Mason&#x27;s former mansion, and the rest of the formerly retroceded area on the night of May 23–24, hours after Virginia voters ratified secession. Three federal units covered the three major trans-Potomac routes, and soon fortified the county as part of the military defenses of the nation&#x27;s capital. Mason&#x27;s Island soon became a U.S. Army training camp called Camp Greene. Following President Lincoln&#x27;s decision to allow African Americans to join the U.S. Army, the 1st United States Colored Infantry used the island to train its soldiers. From 1864 to 1865, the camp housed as many as 1,200 formerly enslaved people, first under the authority of the U.S. Army, and later, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Locals continued to call it &quot;Mason&#x27;s Island&quot; until the memorial was built.

===Test site and gas light company===
Following the declaration of war against Spain in 1898, the island became a test site for a number of private experiments in electrical ignition of the explosives dynamite and joveite led by the chemist Charles Edward Munroe of Columbian University. Monroe&#x27;s experiments, which explored the use of the explosives for mining waterways and roadways and preparing ground for rapid entrenchment, were conducted in secret and without alerting the District of Columbia Police Department, which investigated citizens&#x27; reports of Spanish spy activity and found the explosives and detonators buried on the island.

From 1913 to 1931, Washington Gas Light Company owned the island, and allowed vegetation to grow unchecked on the island.

===National memorial===

In 1931, the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association purchased the island from the gas company with the intention of erecting a memorial honoring Roosevelt. On Dec 12, 1932 in a ceremony in the east room of the White House, President Hoover accepted the island as a shrine to Roosevelt and declared that would be known as Theodore Roosevelt Island. Congress authorized the memorial on May 21, 1932, but did not appropriate funds for the memorial for almost three decades.

Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., a landscape architect known for his wildlife conservation efforts, as well as designs for the National Mall and other areas in the National Capital area (and whom President Theodore Roosevelt had appointed to the McMillan Commission back in 1901), developed a plan for the island. By 1935, the Civilian Conservation Corps had cleared much of the island and pulled down the house&#x27;s remaining walls; today, only part of the mansion&#x27;s foundation remains.

Funds were finally designated by Congress in 1960. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; the listing first appeared on October 15, 1966.

The memorial was dedicated on October 27, 1967. Designed by Eric Gugler, the memorial includes a statue by sculptor Paul Manship, four large stone monoliths with some of Roosevelt&#x27;s more famous quotations, and two large fountains.

==Geography and natural history==
The Potomac River surrounding the island is at sea level, part of the Chesapeake Bay estuary, with the river water fresh but tidal. A narrow channel, unofficially referred to as &quot;Little River&quot; by local users of the Potomac River, separates the island from the Virginia bank of the Potomac, with the main channel of the Potomac between the island and Georgetown, part of Washington, D.C. Surrounding scenery includes the Potomac Gorge and Key Bridge, Georgetown, Rosslyn, and the Kennedy Center. The Virginia state line follows the southern bank of the river, so, despite the fact that the primary access to the island is from Virginia, the island itself is entirely in the District of Columbia.

The rocky western (upriver) and central portions of the island are part of the Piedmont Plateau, while the southeastern part is within the Atlantic Coastal Plain. At one point opposite Georgetown, the Atlantic Seaboard fall line between the Piedmont and the Coastal Plain can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The island has about of shoreline, and the highest area of the island (where the Mason mansion stood) is about above sea level.

Spring floods coming down the Potomac from Appalachia inundate low-lying portions of island&#x27;s shores regularly, usually several times each year, while much larger floods, often from the storm surges and intense, widespread rainfall from coastal hurricanes and tropical storms, flood the island more deeply several times a century.

The island&#x27;s vegetation is quite diverse for a relatively small area, due to its geological and topographic variety, the frequency of floods, its land-use history (including various periods of landscaping), and its location in an urban area in which many non-native species occur. Most of the island is deciduous forest of various kinds, including uplands, riparian shores, and swamps. There is also an area of fresh-water tidal (estuarine) marsh, and a few small bedrock outcrops of metamorphic Piedmont rock, some along the tidal shore. The variety of freshwater estuarine intertidal habitats along the island&#x27;s shores is particularly notable.

The island is particularly known for its variety of birds and its showy displays of spring wildflowers. However, dozens of non-native invasive plants have become abundant there, often outcompeting the native species.

==Access==

Theodore Roosevelt Island is accessible by a footbridge from a parking lot along the Virginia bank of the Potomac River, just north of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, which crosses but does not allow access to the island. Cars can enter this parking lot only from the northbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.

Pedestrians can reach the parking lot and footbridge by following the Mount Vernon Trail south from the intersection of Langston Boulevard and North Lynn Street in Rosslyn, near Key Bridge. The closest Washington Metro station to the island is the Rosslyn station.

Several hiking trails provide access to the memorial and a variety of the island&#x27;s natural habitats, including a boardwalk through a swampy and marshy area.

== In popular culture ==
* A story by Ernest Seton Thompson &quot;The Royal Analostan&quot; mentions the island as the origin of the fictional cat breed.
*The 2014 movie &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; depicted Little Island as the site of the Triskelion, the headquarters of the fictional S.H.I.E.L.D. spy agency.
*In 2019 video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2&quot; the island was the site of a failed quarantine effort after the outbreak of a manufactured epidemic disease. The citizens quarantined on the island radicalized into a group called the &quot;Outcasts&quot;, one of the game&#x27;s major antagonist factions.

<text>The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) is the largest global union federation of journalists&#x27; trade unions in the world. It represents more than 600,000 media workers from 187 organisations in 146 countries.

The IFJ is an associate member of UNESCO and has represented journalists at the United Nations since 1953 (UN/ILO). It works with the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD.

The IFJ President is the French journalist and trade unionist Dominique Pradalié. She succeeded Younes Mjahed. Anthony Bellanger, a French journalist and trade unionist, is the organisation&#x27;s General Secretary.

Upon request, the IFJ delivers the International Press Card to members of its affiliated organisations, the only press pass endorsed by national journalists&#x27; organisations in more than 130 countries.

The Federation&#x27;s headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium (155, rue de la Loi).

== History ==
The International Federation of Journalists was founded in 1926 in Paris, on the initiative of the French Syndicat national des journalistes (SNJ). At the time, it represented about 25 000 media workers from about twenty countries and had its headquarters in Paris. Its first President was the French reporter Georges Bourdon.

With the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, the Second World War put an end to the IFJ&#x27;s activities in Paris. Several unions then decided to form in London the International Federation of Journalists of the Allies or Free Countries (IFJAFC), whose first Congress took place in 1941. IFJAFC dissolved in 1946, once the war was over, becoming the International Organisation of Journalists (IOJ).

As a result of the Cold War, the International Federation of Journalists was relaunched in 1952 at a World Congress in Brussels attended by 49 delegates. It will be competed by the IOJ, based in Prague and composed mainly of national journalists&#x27; unions from Central and Eastern Europe and developing countries, until the 1990s.

The IFJ was officially recognised by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (Ecosoc) and UNESCO.

At IFJ Second World Congress in Bordeaux in 1954, delegates representing more than 43 000 media workers from 21 unions in 18 countries adopted the IFJ Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists, the first widely recognised text on journalistic ethics.

The gradual disappearance of the IOJ in the 1990s gave a new impetus to the IFJ, with the membership of national trade unions from non-aligned states or from the former Soviet bloc. At the same time, IFJ encouraged the regionalisation of its activities and regional offices appeared in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Europe.

In 2019, IFJ 30th World Congress took place for the first time in Africa and in an Arab Country, in Tunis, Tunisia. The Congress proved historical also because the 300 delegates from more than 100 countries adopted the Global Charter of Ethics for Journalists, which reinforced the ethical standards laid down by the 1954 IFJ Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists.

In February 2023, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Union of Journalists was suspended from IFJ after having established activities in occupied parts of Ukraine.

== Priorities and campaigns ==
The International Federation of Journalists supports and organises union of journalists’ activities in defending their rights and press freedom worldwide.

It fights for the improvement of journalists&#x27; working conditions and rights: freedom of expression, fair remuneration, stable employment and decent pay, gender equality and the fight against all forms of discrimination, copyright protection, freedom of association, safety. ... In this regard, it campaigns for the adoption of standards aimed at protecting the journalists’ rights and strengthening collective agreements.

Freelance journalists&#x27; rights are a priority concern for the IFJ, which encourages its affiliates to integrate them in their structures.

The IFJ deals with various threats to press freedom: media concentration, repressive laws, censorship, intimidations, and impunity for crimes against media workers.

=== Gender equality ===
The Federation promotes equality between women and men journalists in editorial offices and the workplace, in trade unions and in the content of information.

IFJ Gender Council was founded in 2001 and is composed of representatives of organisations affiliated to the IFJ. It is an advisory body that sets the organisation&#x27;s priorities in terms of gender equality and LGBTI representation.

The IFJ&#x27;s objectives for achieving equality include: equal pay, women&#x27;s access to positions of responsibility in both the media and trade unions, conciliation of private and professional life, combating all forms of harassment, discrimination and violence against women journalists, balanced and unbiased representation of women and men in information content and at all levels of the media industry.

===Safety===
Since 1990, the IFJ has published an annual report (the &quot;Killed list&quot;) which documents cases of journalists and media staff killed during the course of each year. It uses the information to campaign for greater safety for journalists, particularly local and freelance reporters and support staff who lack the resources to protect themselves in conflict zones. The annual reports are archived on the website.

Since 1992, the Federation has also had a Safety Fund to support journalists (and their families) when faced with persecution. It has become internationally recognised as an important and crucial source of support for journalists under threat. It is the only international assistance fund for journalists established by journalists.

The Safety Fund is an integral part of the IFJ Safety Programme which includes casework, protests, campaigns, provision of information and production of various publications.

Besides, the IFJ organises safety trainings for journalists working in dangerous areas.

== Organization ==
The IFJ Head Office is located in Brussels, Belgium.

The Federation has regional organisations in Africa (Federation of African Journalists – FAJ), Europe (European Federation of Journalists) and Latin America (Federación de Periodistas de América Latina y el Caribe -FEPALC).

Regional offices are located in Sydney (Australia), Dakar (Senegal), Brussels and Buenos Aires (Argentina).

The Congress is the supreme organ of the Federation. Every three years, it brings together delegates from all its member unions.

Moroccan journalist and trade unionist Younes Mjahed was elected IFJ President during IFJ Congress in Tunis in 2019. He succeeded the Belgian journalist Philippe Leruth, elected at the Angers Congress in 2016.

French journalist and trade unionist Anthony Bellanger has been the IFJ General Secretary since 2015. He was First General Secretary of the French Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) from 2011 to 2014.

<doc id="1178865" wikidata="Q272521" url="?curid=1178865" title="Ténéré">
<text>The Ténéré (Tuareg: Tenere, literally: &quot;desert&quot;) is a desert region in south central Sahara. It comprises a vast plain of sand stretching from northeastern Niger to western Chad, occupying an area of over . The Ténéré&#x27;s boundaries are said to be the Aïr Mountains in the west, the Hoggar Mountains in the north, the Djado Plateau in the northeast, the Tibesti Mountains in the east, and the basin of Lake Chad in the south. The central part of the desert, the Erg du Bilma, is centred at approximately . It is the locus of the Neolithic Tenerian culture.

==Name==
The name &quot;Ténéré&quot; comes from the Tuareg language, meaning &quot;desert&quot;, in much the same way as the Arabic word for &quot;desert&quot;, &quot;Sahara&quot;, came to be applied to the region as a whole.

==Climate==
The Ténéré has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), typical of the large Sahara Desert. The climate is hyper-arid, extremely hot, sunny and dry year-round and there is virtually no plant life. The average high temperatures are above 40 °C (104 °F) for about 5 months and more in the hottest regions, and record high temperatures as high as 50 °C (122 °F) are highly possible during summer. The annual average high temperature is around 35 °C (95 °F). During &quot;winter&quot; months, the average high temperatures stay above 25 °C (77 °F) and generally hover around 30 °C (86 °F).

The annual precipitation amount is extremely low—one of the lowest annual rainfall amounts found on Earth—around 10 mm (0.39 in) to 15 mm (0.59 in), and frequently several years may pass without seeing any rainfall at all. Water is notoriously difficult to find, even underground, and wells may be hundreds of miles apart.

The sunshine duration is also one of the highest results on the planet at around 4,000 hours, that is about 91% of the daylight hours between sunrise and sunset. This part of the Sahara Desert has one of the harshest climates in the world. According to a NASA study, the sunniest spot in the world would be a ruined fort in Agadem in the southeastern Ténéré, and has even clearer skies than the polar deserts overall. The Ténéré, as well as the rest of the Great Desert, are amongst the most extreme environments on Earth.

==Topography==
Most of the Ténéré is a flat basin, once the bed of the prehistoric Lake Chad. In the north, the Ténéré is a vast sand sheet - the true, featureless &#x27;Ténéré&#x27; of legend reaching up to the low hills of the Tassili du Hoggar along the Algerian border. In the centre, the Bilma Erg forms rows of easily navigable low dunes whose corridors make regular byways for the azalai or salt caravans. To the west, the Aïr Mountains rise up. To the southeast, the Ténéré is bordered by the Kaouar cliffs running 100 km north to south. At the base, lies a string of oases including the famous Bilma. Periodic outcrops, such as the unusual marble Blue Mountains in the northwest near Adrar Chiriet, or the Agram hills near the oasis of Fachi and Adrar Madet to the north, are rare but notable landmarks.

==History==
During the Carboniferous period, the region was beneath the sea; later it was a tropical forest. A major dinosaur cemetery lies southeast of Agadez at Gadoufaoua; many fossils have been found there, having eroded out from the ground. An almost complete specimen of the crocodile-like reptile &quot;Sarcosuchus imperator&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;SuperCroc&quot;, was discovered there by paleontologists.

During early human history, this was a fertile land much more congenial to human life than it is now. The region was inhabited by modern humans as long ago as the Paleolithic period some 60,000 years ago. They hunted wild animals and left evidence of their presence in the form of stone tools including tiny, finely carved arrow heads. During the Neolithic period about 10,000 years ago, ancient hunters, the early Holocene Kiffian people, created rock engravings and cave paintings that can still be found across the region.

The Neolithic Subpluvial was an extended meteorological period, from about 7,500-7,000 BC to about 3,500-3,000 BC, of relatively wet and rainy conditions in the climate history of northern Africa. It was both preceded and followed by much drier periods. Several archaeological sites that date from this time, often identified as part of the Tenerian culture, are dotted across the deserts along the borders of Niger, Algeria and Libya. The human population dwindled as the Sahara dried out, and by 2500 BC, it had largely become as dry as it is today.

In recent times, Ténéré has been a crossing route for African migrants looking to immigrate to Europe.

=== UTA Flight 772 ===

On September 19, 1989, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 took off from N&#x27;Djamena International Airport and forty-six minutes later a suitcase bomb exploded in the hold. The jet crashed into the desert near Bilma, Niger, killing all 156 passengers and 14 crew members on board, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in Niger.

==Population==

The Ténéré is very sparsely populated. Fachi and Bilma are the only settlements that are not on the edge of the Tenéré.

While the well-known Tuareg occupy the Aïr Mountains and Agadez to the west, and still operate the salt caravans for Hausa merchants, other inhabitants of the Ténéré, found from oases like Fachi eastwards, are the non-Berber Kanuri and Toubou.

==Governance==
In 1960, the Tuareg territory became part of the independent republic of Niger. It has been divided into seven &quot;départments&quot;. The central part of the Ténéré is a protected area, under the auspices of the Aïr and Ténéré Natural Reserve.

==Cities==
The administrative centre of the Ténéré is the town of Agadez, south of the Aïr Mountains and west of the Tenere. There are also various oasis settlements, some like Bilma and Séguedine based on salt production.

Settlements and villages of Ténéré:

*Fachi
*Bilma
*Dirkou
*
*Séguedine

==Landmarks==

The desert is also known for the celebrated Tree of Ténéré, once thought to be among the most remote in the world. Situated by the last well before entering the Grand Erg du Bilma on the way to Fachi, salt caravans relied on the tree as a landmark until it was allegedly knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.

It was replaced by a metal sculpture and the remains are enshrined at the museum in Niamey (capital of Niger). New trees were planted but, because of the very low water table (the adjacent well is some 40m deep), irregular watering by passing travellers saw them fail to survive. Despite this unfortunate mishap, the tree is still often indicated on maps of the region as a notable landmark, as is the less well-known Arbre Perdu (Lost Tree) situated in the true Tenere to the north, west of Chirfa.

A monument to UTA Flight 772, a 200-foot diameter circle of dark stones and 170 broken mirrors which represent each victim of the 1989 terrorist attack which brought down the aircraft, was built in May and June 2007 at 16°51′53″N 11°57′13″E.

<text>This article is about the History of [[Timișoara]], the largest and most important city in the Romanian Banat. Timișoara is also known by the following names: Hungarian: &quot;Temesvár&quot;, German: &quot;Temeswar&quot; / &quot;Temeschwar&quot; / &quot;Temeschburg&quot;, Serbo-Croatian: &quot;Temišvar&quot; / &quot;Темишвар&quot;, Turkish: &quot;Tamışvar&quot; / &quot;Temeşvar&quot;.

==Antiquity==
Archaeological discoveries prove that the area where Timișoara is located today has been inhabited since ancient times. The first identifiable civilization in this area were the Agathyrsi, who could be the namers of the Mureș river. The Getae, who were relatives to the Dacians conquered the territory in 335 BC. From coin finds, it is known that the settlement was inhabited during the Roman settlement of Dacia. While no record of the settlement is known from those times, it is generally agreed that the site was inhabited through the Middle Ages when the city was mentioned for the first time.

== Middle Ages ==

Archaeological finds from a medieval cemetery show that a community of warriors settled in the region west of the present-day town in the second half of the . Almost half of the 41 graves yielded grave goods (including arrow heads, hair rings, earrings and bracelets), suggesting that those who were buried in the cemetery persisted with their pagan rites. The placing of arrow heads into graves is well documented among 10th-century Hungarian warriors in the Carpathian Basin. The position of the arm bones in ten graves may indicates that Christians or people influenced by Christianity were also buried in the cemetery. Various types of rings point at commercial contacts between the local inhabitants and the Balkan Peninsula. The cemetery was abandoned in the first decades of the .

The mid-12th-century Muslim geographer, Muhammad al-Idrisi, mentioned a town named &quot;T.n.y.s.b.r&quot; and described it as a prosperous settlement, located to the south of the river &quot;T.y.s.y.a&quot;, or Tisza. Historian István Petrovics associates T.n.y.s.b.r with Temesvár, suggesting that Idrisi mislocated it because he had no direct information of the town. Timișoara was named after a fortress: the Hungarian name of the town, Temesvár, refers to a castle &quot;(vár)&quot; on the river Timiș (Temes). The fortress was first mentioned in the &quot;Register of Arad&quot; around 1177. The document mentioned two villages, &quot;Sep&quot; and &quot;Vrman&quot;, on the royal estates attached to the fortress &quot;Demesiensis&quot;. It was most probably made of earth and timber, according to historian Ferenc Sebők. The fortress, which was erected on a swampy land, near a tributary of the Temes, the Bega, was the seat of the &quot;ispán&quot;, or head of Temes County. In 1241 the city was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary and Poland, but the walls were rebuilt.

Charles I of Hungary took up his residence in Temesvár in 1315, because a dozen powerful lords who had refused to yield to him controlled large territories in other parts of Hungary. In the next years, a royal castle was erected near the old fortress and the latter was rebuilt with stone. According to Petrovics, the church dedicated to Saint Eligius implies that Italian artisans settled in the town during this period, because the saint was primarily venerated in Naples. The Dominicans settled in the town before Csanád Telegdi was consecrated bishop in their local church in early 1323. After Charles I restored royal authority, he transferred his court from Temesvár to the centrally-located Visegrád in the summer of 1323.

The &quot;guest settlers&quot; in the town &quot;(hospites de Themeswar)&quot; were first mentioned in 1341, the burghers of Timișoara &quot;(cives de Temeswar)&quot; in 1342. The ethnicity of the citizens was rarely mentioned, but their names suggest that most &quot;guest settlers&quot; and burghers were Hungarians. Records of citizens who moved from Șemlacu Mare, Maráz and other nearby villages to Temesvár prove that it had developed into an important regional center. Merchants from Ragusa (now Dubrovnik in Croatia) settled in the town around 1402. Bulgarians, Romanians and Serbians also moved to the town in the . For instance, the name of Johannes Olaah (&quot;John the Vlach&quot;), who was a burgher of Temesvár in 1539, suggests that he was of Romanian origin.

By the middle of the 14th century, Temesvár was at the forefront of Western Christendom&#x27;s battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks. French and Hungarian crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used Temesvár as a military stronghold against the Turks, having built a powerful fortress. The city was repeatedly sieged by the Ottomans in 1462, 1476, 1491, and 1522.

In 1514 the largest peasants&#x27; revolt in Hungarian history was defeated in a battle near Temesvár and its Székely leader György Dózsa was tortured and executed.

==Ottoman Rule==

Because of Temesvár&#x27;s strategic location, the Ottomans desired to capture the fortress during their campaigns against the Kingdom of Hungary. Although the Hungarians suffered a devastating loss at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Temesvár was not conquered by the Ottomans until October 1551.

The city was transformed into the administrative centre of an Ottoman province, the Province of Temeşvar. The fortress was rebuilt and, along with Belgrade, used as a major military base by the Ottomans. Because of its military orientation, the city itself developed slowly during the Ottoman administration. Timișoara had two fortified parts: the castle and the city, which was surrounded by wooden and stone walls. 200 guns were used to defend the city as well as water trenches around the walls. Approximately 1,200 houses, schools, hotels, and public baths were to be found inside the walls, while outside the walls around 1,500 other houses were present.

==The Habsburg Era==
The Ottomans surrendered the city to the Habsburg Imperial armies led by Prince Eugene of Savoy on 12 October 1716 during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18. Prince Eugene entered the city on October 18 and named one of his officers, Claudius Florimund Mercy, as governor of the city. Because the town had burned down during the siege, the city was completely rebuilt under Mercy&#x27;s supervision. Temesvár was officially conceded to the Austrian Habsburg monarchy by the Ottomans in the Treaty of Passarowitz of 1718. Temesvár became the capital of the &quot;Banat of Temeswar&quot;, a separate Habsburg province. The province was abolished in 1778, reincorporated into Kingdom of Hungary.

Under Habsburg rule, a new stone fortress was built around the city in 1723. Inside the walls houses, hospitals, schools, and churches were being raised, while outside the city factories were being opened. By the 1720 data, most of the inhabitants of the town were ethnic Serbs, and also some Romanians. Later, German, Italian, and Spanish settlers were brought in to settle in the area. The marshland around the city was reclaimed, while the rivers Bega and Temes became regulated. The city remained a military stronghold with a large garrison. This period was one of strong economic development and population increases. By 1781 Temesvár was one of the most important cities of the Habsburg monarchy and as such it received a royal free city warrant which would accelerate the development of the city even further. Because of the Habsburg administration, Temesvár was often referred to by the German names &quot;Temeschburg&quot;, meaning &quot;castle (&quot;Burg&quot;) on the Temes&quot; or &quot;Temeschwar&quot;, based on the Hungarian Temesvár. Temesvár was captured in 1788 and looted by Ottomans in 1789 during Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791).

==The 1848/1849 Revolution==

During the Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries took over the Hungarian government. Because the Austrian commander of the city&#x27;s garrison decided to defend the Habsburg interests, the Hungarian army began an unsuccessful siege of Temesvár that lasted for 114 days. In the later stage of the revolution, the city was captured by the Serbian troops and for a short time was a capital of the Serbian Vojvodina.

==Modernization of Temesvár==

The development of the city continued after the attempted 1848/1849 revolution. In 1849, Temesvár became the capital of the new Habsburg province named Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat. The province was abolished in 1860. The city became capital of Temes County after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 which united the administrations of the region with those of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1853 telegraphy was introduced in the city, and in 1857 Timișoara received gas street lighting. In 1857 a train line linking Temesvár with Szeged was constructed, and in 1867 horse trams were introduced in the city. The Hungarian city of Temesvár became the first European city to have electric street lights in 1884, while the trams became electric in 1899 (after Bucharest in 1884). Temesvár was also the first city in the Kingdom of Hungary and later Romania to have an ambulance station.

After World War I, following an ephemerous pro-Hungary Banat Republic, and occupation by the Serbian Army, Timișoara was incorporated into the Kingdom of Romania in 1919 together with most of the Banat region.

==The Romanian Revolution of 1989==

In December 1989 a popular uprising began in Timișoara against the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu.
The Hungarian Calvinist pastor László Tőkés was ordered to be deported by the Securitate, or secret police, and as a reaction his house was surrounded by members of his church. People supporting him, including people of Romanian origin, gathered at the central square (Opera Square). The Communist administration ordered the army to fire at the congregation. However, a number of army officers refused to open fire and sided with the people. That was the beginning of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which ended the Communist regime a week later. Timișoara was declared the first Free Town on 20 December 1989, suffering 130 reported deaths and 3,352 wounded during the revolution .

<text>Bananas Foster is a dessert made from bananas and vanilla ice cream, with a sauce made from butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, dark rum, and banana liqueur. The butter, sugar and bananas are cooked, and then alcohol is added and ignited. The bananas and sauce are then served over the ice cream. Popular toppings also include whipped cream and different types of nuts (pecans, walnuts, etc.). The dish is often prepared tableside as a flambé.

==History==
Bananas Foster is an American dessert that originated in New Orleans made with cooked bananas served in a butter, brown sugar and rum sauce. The caramelized liquor-based sauce is often prepared via flambé. This dessert can be served with vanilla ice cream or as a crêpe filling, but it may also be eaten on its own. Cinnamon and nutmeg may be added as seasoning.

The dish was created at Brennan&#x27;s in New Orleans, Louisiana, where got its start a few years earlier when the restaurant was still in its older location and known as Owen Brennan&#x27;s Vieux Carré. In 1951, Ella Brennan and the restaurant&#x27;s chef Paul Blangé worked together to modify a dish made by Ella&#x27;s mother in the Brennan family home. At this time, New Orleans was a major hub for the import of bananas from South America. It was named for Richard Foster, the chairman of the New Orleans Crime Commission and a friend of restaurant owner Owen Brennan.

<doc id="1178908" wikidata="Q721455" url="?curid=1178908" title="Miami Gardens, Florida">
<text>Miami Gardens is a city in north-central Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is a suburb of Miami and located north of downtown Miami with city boundaries that stretch from I-95 and Northeast 2nd Avenue to its east to Northwest 47th and Northwest 57th Avenues to its west, and from the Broward County line to its north to 151st Street to its south. The city&#x27;s name originated from Florida State Road 860, a major roadway through the area also known as Miami Gardens Drive. It had a population of 111,640 as of 2020.

Miami Gardens is Florida&#x27;s most populous city with a majority African American population and also home to the largest percentage of African Americans (66.97 percent) of any city in Florida, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is a principal city in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, which is the nation&#x27;s ninth-largest, and world&#x27;s 65th-largest metropolitan area with a population of 6.158 million people as of 2020. Miami Gardens is the home of Hard Rock Stadium, a 64,767 capacity multi-purpose stadium that serves as the home field for both the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League and the Miami Hurricanes, the University of Miami&#x27;s NCAA Division I college football team.

==History==
In the wake of the construction of I-95 in the late 1960s, many middle- and upper-income African American and West Indian American families migrated from Miami neighborhoods like Liberty City to what became Miami Gardens (also called Carol City, Norland, or Norwood) as race-based covenants were outlawed with the Fair Housing Act, and mostly lower income blacks moved into the Liberty City and Little Haiti neighborhoods surrounding Liberty Square and Edison Courts.

Miami Gardens was incorporated on May 13, 2003. The city&#x27;s neighborhoods of Andover, Bunche Park, Carol City, Lake Lucerne, Norland, Opa-locka North, and Scott Lake were previously unincorporated areas within Miami-Dade County.

In 2007, Mayor Shirley Gibson said that the city would no longer allow any low-income housing developments; many residents blamed the developments for spreading crime and recreational drugs throughout the city. Around that time, the city&#x27;s tax revenues dropped to the third-lowest in Miami-Dade County.

In 2012, Oliver Gilbert, only the second mayor the city has had, proposed forming a community redevelopment agency (CRA). CRAs are formed to remove &quot;slum and blight&quot;, to improve the physical environment of the city and to combat the social and economic problems typical of slum areas. CRAs are funded with property tax increases, which funds are used, in part, to stimulate private investment in the rehabilitation of the community.

During the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Hard Rock Stadium will host multiple matches during the tournament.

==Demographics==
The city was incorporated in 2003, but various parts of the city appeared as census designated places in the 2000 census and previous censuses. In addition to the Miami Gardens CDP (pop. 2,706 in 2000), the remainder make up the neighborhoods of Andover, Bunche Park, Carol City, Lake Lucerne, Norland, Opa-locka North, and Scott Lake. The United States Census Bureau enumerated that the population of Miami Gardens was 111,640 per the 2020 census.

The population was 46.9% male and 53.1% female. Families made up 72% of households, while 28% were non-families. The average household size was 3.52 members, and the city covered .

These are 17 of the many departments for which the City Manager of Miami Gardens creates a budget.
===Mayors===

===Police===

The Miami Gardens Police Department is the lead law enforcement agency for the 110,000 residents living within the city&#x27;s . The department operates under a unified command structure with its headquarters located at 1020 NW 163 Drive, Miami Gardens, Florida 33169. The department became operational on Sunday, December 16, 2007, with 159 sworn officers. Since then, the department has grown to 259 members consisting of 201 sworn positions with 58 non-sworn support positions.

==Police controversy==

In 2013, law enforcement abuses were alleged regarding the Miami Gardens Police Department by several news outlets. The abuses were first uncovered when it became public that a convenience store employee, Earl Sampson was arrested 27 times for trespassing, while working at and around the store at which he was employed. Video evidence was gathered by the owner of the store, Ali Saleh, showing Miami Garden police involved in clear and repeated misconduct involving his employee, and customers. According to the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;″s Julie K. Brown: &quot;The videos show, among other things, cops stopping citizens, questioning them, aggressively searching them and arresting them for trespassing when they have permission to be on the premises&quot;. It appeared Sampson had been arrested in this way due to police quotas, a department culture, and that Sampson was easy to arrest. Sampson always pleaded guilty so they would let him out almost immediately, with one exception where he pleaded not guilty, and he was jailed for 20 days. The guilty plea would validate the officers&#x27; improper arrest and increment their quota, so he became a continuous target.

===Volume of stops===

It was reported that, between 2008 and 2013, 99,980 stops occurred in Miami Gardens, involving 56,922 people, over half of the city&#x27;s population. In the City of Miami, 3,753 stops occurred during the same period, with four times the population. Some stops involved children aged 5 to 7, totaling more than 1,000 children. These numbers were compiled after news regarding Earl Sampson.

===Resignation and lawsuits===

Following these reports, the police chief resigned. 
Civil rights lawsuits have been filed against the Miami Gardens Police Department by the store owner and others who were illegally detained and/or arrested.
A police officer filed a lawsuit claiming that he had been fired for reporting abuses.

==Economy==

In 2003, Miami Gardens based Merchandize Liquidators was founded.

<doc id="1178913" wikidata="Q6081504" url="?curid=1178913" title="Isla Verde, Puerto Rico">
<text>Isla Verde (Spanish for &quot;green island&quot;) is an urbanized, beachfront resort and residential district with various upscale hotels and condominiums in the municipality of Carolina, where the main airport of Puerto Rico, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, is located. Named after a small cay and reef near the shoreline, Isla Verde is about east of the Hato Rey business center, Condado resort area, and Old San Juan historic quarter in the adjacent capital municipality of San Juan, between the Los Corozos and San José Lagoon and La Torrecilla Lagoon, which lies next to the state forest, beaches, and street food kiosks of the &quot;Piñones&quot; (&quot;pine nuts&quot;) Afro-Puerto Rican community in the municipality of Loíza.

==Geolocation==

Isla Verde is named after a small cay surrounded by a coral reef measuring 2,518 m2 (0.6 acres) about 400 meters north of the shoreline at &quot;Punta del Medio&quot; (&quot;middle point&quot;) in the barrio of Cangrejo Arriba in the municipality of Carolina. Isla Verde is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west by the barrio of Santurce in the capital municipality of San Juan, to the east by the barrio of Torrecilla Baja in the municipality of Loíza, and to the south by the Luis Muñoz Internacional Airport in Carolina. The Teodoro Moscoso Bridge connects Isla Verde to Hato Rey, the financial and commercial center of the main metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. Along with the Condado resort and residential district, it is one of the main tourist areas in the metropolitan area, hosting popular restaurants, hotels, casinos, and resorts.

==Neighborhood entanglements==
The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, which is often mistakenly thought to be situated in the capital municipality of San Juan, is located in Isla Verde, which is within the limits of the municipality of Carolina. Originally, the airport was given the unofficial title &quot;Isla Verde International Airport&quot;, both by locals and visitors. Its residents tend to downplay the fact that the area is technically part of Carolina because Isla Verde shares the coastline with Ocean park and Condado, which are both nearby and part of Santurce, one of the capital&#x27;s historic districts.

Since the airport&#x27;s creation and up until the September 11, 2001 attacks, aviation fans could enjoy a day at the beach, and at the same time, watch the aircraft land or take-off at a specially designed spot located near Piñones, Loíza. As a consequence of the attacks, the spot was closed to the general public because it might compromise airport security. Because of the airport&#x27;s location in the Isla Verde area, some streets have had to be closed several times during visits by dignitaries and celebrities (most notably when a local has had overseas success in a competition). The area has a multitude of restaurants, hotels and high-priced homes as well as hotels and resorts.

Many celebrities have lived in Isla Verde&#x27;s affluent areas, including some former members of the boy band Menudo, including Ricky Martin. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was home to one of the world&#x27;s more popular discos of the time: The Flying Sauce, owned by Charlie Garcia who had promoted the Muhammad Ali vs. Jean Pierre Coopman fight at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. The Flying Saucer had a capacity of 800 people and over 10,000 were left outside opening night as DJ Orlando Torres del Pino had to force himself into the club. Isla Verde is home to a large Cuban exile community centered on Casa Cuba, which is Puerto Rico&#x27;s main Cuban social club.

===Public Transportation===
The Isla Verde bus terminal has routes to various other parts of San Juan:

* 50 to Luis Muñoz Marín Airport
* 45 to Luis Muñoz Marín Airport and Piñero
* 40 to Piñero
* 5 to Santurce and Old San Juan
* 53 to Condado and Old San Juan

There are two bus systems serving the Isla Verde bus terminal: AMA, the main public transportation system and SITRAC which travels in the Isla Verde Hotel district. The public bus 5 and 53 which will take you from the Bus Terminal to Old San Juan (e.g. to El Morro) in roughly 1 hour. 
The SITRAC bus is free but only stays in Isla Verde. The public bus costs 75 cents to ride.

Available at all times, taxis charge about $20 for a ride to the Condado and Old San Juan areas.

==Subareas==
Isla Verde is near the largest public housing project in Puerto Rico, the Luis Llorens Torres Residential Complex, which is within the limits of the municipality of San Juan. In March 2021, a higher police presence was planned for Isla Verde.

<text>Guyasuta (c. 1725–c. 1794; , &quot;he stands up to the cross&quot; or &quot;he sets up the cross&quot;) was an important Native American leader of the Seneca people in the second half of the eighteenth century, playing a central role in the diplomacy and warfare of that era. Although he became friends with George Washington in 1753, he sided with the French against Britain during the French and Indian War and fought against the British in Pontiac&#x27;s War. He later supported the British during the American Revolutionary War. In his final years, he engaged in peacemaking to end the Northwest Indian War.

== Early life and family ==

Born in a Mingo community in upstate New York, probably on the Genesee River, he and his family migrated along the Allegheny River and after 1725 they settled in Logstown, a mostly-Iroquois village in Pennsylvania. Guyasuta was a maternal uncle to Cornplanter and Handsome Lake. He was distantly related to Governor Blacksnake and Red Jacket.

Guyasuta married twice and had six sons, of whom very little is known. He is reported to have sent one of his sons to Philadelphia &quot;to learn English, to be an interpreter.&quot; In August 1762 the boy was returned to his family.

== Journey with Washington, 1753 ==

Guyasuta first appears in colonial records when he met the 21-year-old George Washington, who had been assigned to deliver a message to the French commandant at Fort Leboeuf. In late 1753, Virginia Governor Dinwiddie appointed newly-commissioned Major Washington as a special envoy to demand that the French vacate the Ohio Country, which the British had claimed. Arriving with Christopher Gist in Logstown on November 23, Washington held council with Native American leaders, including Shingas, Scarouady, and Tanacharison. Washington explained his mission and received assurances that the Indians and the English &quot;were brothers.&quot; Tanacharison told Washington that &quot;he cou’d not consent to our going without a Guard, for fear some Accident shou’d befall us,&quot; and volunteered to accompany Washington, along with Kaghswaghtaniunt (White Thunder), Guyasuta, and Jeskakake. Their purpose was to return three belts of wampum sent by the French as a symbol of friendship. Returning the wampum was a gesture intended to show that the sachems at Logstown were allied with the English. Washington wrote in his diary that &quot;I knew that returning of Wampum was the abolishing of Agreements; &amp; giving this up was shaking of all Dependence upon the French.&quot; Guyasuta referred to George Washington as &quot;Tall Hunter,&quot; and is referred to as &quot;The Hunter,&quot; and &quot;one of their best Hunters,&quot; in Washington&#x27;s journal, &quot;Journey to the French Commandant.&quot; 

Washington and his men left Logstown on November 30 and reached Venango at French Creek on December 4, where they were warmly greeted by Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, who was in command of the French troops at Venango. Joncaire provided Washington&#x27;s men with wine and brandy, and when intoxicated, Washington&#x27;s Native American companions, including Guyasuta, declared their loyalty to the French. It took Washington three days to persuade them to move on to Fort Le Boeuf, where they met the French commander Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre. Tanacharison tried to return the wampum to Saint-Pierre, &quot;who evaded taking it, &amp; made many fair Promises of Love &amp; Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace &amp; trade amicably with them; as a Proof of which, he wou’d send some Goods immediately down to the Logstown for them. As they prepared to leave, White Thunder was injured, and Tanacharison decided to stay with him, sending Guyasuta to accompany Washington and Gist, but as Washington&#x27;s horses were slowed down by baggage, Washington and Gist left them with Guyasuta and a driver and proceeded on foot. Guyasuta returned with Tanacharison to Logstown on January 15, 1754.

== French and Indian War ==
=== Battle of the Monongahela ===

In July 1755, as the Braddock Expedition marched towards Fort Duquesne, the French recruited Native American warriors, including Ottawas, Ojibwes, Mississaugas, and Ohio Valley Indians including Guyasuta, to assist in its defense. General Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur felt that the warriors would be less effective in or near the fort, and instead deployed them in the open forests south of the fort, where their rifles could hit targets at long range while the Indians fired from behind rocks and trees. The British were unable to employ traditional volley fire tactics and were routed. When Guyasuta met Washington again in Ohio in October 1770, the warrior described how he had attempted to shoot Washington twice on the field of battle, and both times something had mysteriously deflected his bullet.

=== Delegation to Montreal ===

Guyasuta was recognized for his participation in the victory, and in late 1755 was selected to lead a party of twenty Senecas to visit Montreal accompanied by Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, who served as interpreter. At the Château Vaudreuil the Indians were received in the council chamber with much ceremony by the Governor General of Canada, the Marquis de Vaudreuil. Guyasuta, chief and orator of the Senecas, addressed Vaudreuil, seeking a formal alliance with the French. The delegation remained in Montreal until the following spring.

=== Adoption of Simon Girty ===

In August 1756, Guyasuta participated in the capture of Fort Granville, taking captive 22 soldiers, 3 women, and 5 or 6 children, among whom were 15-year-old Simon Girty, his three brothers, and his mother and stepfather. Simon Girty was adopted by Guyasuta and lived with him until 1764, when by arrangement with Colonel Henry Bouquet, over 200 white captives were handed over to British authorities. On November 14 1764, Guyasuta took Girty to Bouquet&#x27;s camp on the Muskingum River and handed him over directly to Lieutenant Alexander McKee, assistant deputy agent for the British Indian Department. Having learned nine Native American languages during his years with the Seneca, Girty became an interpreter for the British Army and, in this role, encountered Guyasuta frequently during negotiations.

=== Battle of Fort Duquesne ===

In September 1758, Guyasuta was again called to defend Fort Duquesne when the Forbes Expedition arrived. A reconnaissance force under Major James Grant had gone ahead, and Grant decided to attack the fort, thinking that the garrison would be easily overcome. Instead, in the ensuing Battle of Fort Duquesne, French marines and Native American warriors overwhelmed Grant&#x27;s troops, capturing him. James Smith described the battle:
:&quot;The French and Indians knew not that Grant and his men were there until they beat the drum and played upon the bagpipes, just at daylight. They then flew to arms, and the Indians ran up under cover of the banks of Allegheny and Monongahela, for some distance, and then sallied out from the banks of the rivers, and took possession of the hill above Grant; and as he was on the point of it in sight of the fort, they immediately surrounded him, and as he had his Highlanders in ranks, and in very close order, and the Indians scattered, and concealed behind trees, they defeated him with the loss only of a few warriors; most of the Highlanders were killed or taken prisoners.&quot; 

Guyasuta&#x27;s warriors decapitated the bodies of Grant&#x27;s highlanders and impaled the heads on stakes in front of the fort.

=== Battle of Loyalhanna ===

In October 1758, Guyasuta led a force of warriors in the Battle of Loyalhanna, together with 450 French troops under the command of Charles Philippe Aubry and 150 Lenape led by Keekyuscung, but the British, under the command of Colonel James Burd, repulsed the attack.

=== Peace conference at Fort Pitt, 1759 ===

In July 1759, Guyasuta, two other chiefs and sixteen warriors of the Six Nations, along with a number of Lenape, Shawnee and Wyandot leaders, attended a conference at Pittsburgh with George Croghan, William Trent, Colonel Hugh Mercer, and the officers of Fort Pitt. At this conference the terms of the 1758 Treaty of Easton were reaffirmed, and the tribal leaders promised to hand over captives taken during the French and Indian War. Guyasuta became close friends with George Croghan at this conference, a relationship which they maintained for many years. Croghan once referred to Guyasuta as &quot;a Sencable good Tempered Indian.&quot;

== Pontiac&#x27;s War ==
Guyasuta was a major player in Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion—indeed, some historians once referred to that war as the &quot;Pontiac–Guyasuta War&quot;. As early as 1761 he and Seneca war chief Tahaiadoris were circulating a large red wampum belt, known as the war hatchet, among the Native American communities near Detroit. According to Sir William Johnson&#x27;s deputy, George Croghan, the purpose was to bring on a general uprising, which appeared imminent. Croghan learned that Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris were planning to incite the tribes around Detroit, the Ottawa, Potawatomi, and Wyandot, to surprise the garrison there and take over the fort, giving their warriors access to abundant stores of guns and ammunition. Next, the nations in the Ohio River Valley, the Delaware, Shawnee, and Twightwee, would attack the smaller forts around Fort Pitt. The Mingo and other Iroquois allies would attack and capture the French-built forts of Presque Isle, Fort Le Boeuf, and Fort Venango. Finally, the Iroquois Six Nations Confederacy would cut communications between Fort Niagara, Oswego, and the Mohawk Valley. With these communication and supply routes secured, the major military posts at Niagara and Fort Pitt could be starved into surrender, as the Native Americans were not inclined to try to take these forts by force, being unaccustomed to siege warfare. 

This scheme assumed that the French would support the uprising with weaponry and hopefully troops. Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris also suggested forming an alliance with the Cherokee, who were traditional enemies of the Iroquois. Guyasuta&#x27;s interpreter revealed the plot to the commander at Fort Detroit, and an Odawa chief confirmed the allegation, identifying Guysuta as the &quot;bad bird among us.&quot; Guyasuta confessed his involvement in the scheme to Croghan several years later.

Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris visited several of the Ohio Valley tribes and sent wampum war belts to tribes in the Illinois country, trying to convene a war conference in Sandusky, but many tribal leaders were skeptical of their plan. Native American communities were still recovering from the French and Indian War and were not ready to make enemies of the British and their powerful armies. Even Jeffery Amherst, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the British Army, dismissed the scheme, doubting that the tribes could coordinate such a massive and complex operation. But Amherst then began implementing policies that increased tension among Native Americans. He demanded that captives be returned and that Native Americans accused of committing crimes against white settlers be tried and punished according to British law. He also severely restricted the quantity and types of goods to be sold or given to the Indians, particularly firearms and alcohol. Amherst was opposed to the practice of gift-giving, a traditional part of Native American alliances, as he felt this supported a &quot;culture of dependency.&quot; This created a wave of anger and resentment that Pontiac exploited in 1763, after it was announced that France had signed a peace treaty with Britain and the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; would come under British control, contrary to previous British promises to leave the region.

Although the Seneca remained neutral during the war, Guyasuta and other Seneca warriors took part in the capture of Fort Venango, gaining entrance to the fort by pretending to be unarmed and friendly. A few days later, Guyasuta and his warriors joined in the assault on Fort Presque Isle and then participated in the siege of Fort Pitt. When Colonel Henry Bouquet arrived with a relief column, Guyasuta joined Delaware and Shawnee warriors in trying to prevent it from reaching the fort. They were defeated at the Battle of Bushy Run. Guyasuta signed a preliminary peace agreement on August 12 1764, and participated in the handover of captives, including his own adopted son, Simon Girty.

== Peace conference at Fort Pitt, 1765 ==

On May 10 1765, Guyasuta attended a peace conference at Fort Pitt to discuss the resumption of trade relations between Pennsylvania
and the Western Indians after Pontiac&#x27;s War. He was one of the principal speakers on this occasion, and represented the Senecas. He made a speech which summarizes the distrust and frustration most Native Americans felt after inconsistent treatment by the British government:
:&quot;&quot;When you first came to drive the French from this place, the Governor of Pennsylvania sent us a Message that we should withdraw from the French, &amp; that when the English was settled here, we should want for nothing. It&#x27;s true, you did supply us very well, but it was only while the War was doubtful, &amp; as soon as you conquer&#x27;d the French you did not care how you treated us, as you did not then think us worth your Notice; we request you may not treat us again in this manner, but now open the Trade and do not put us off with telling us you must first hear from your great man before it can be done. If you have but little goods, let us have them for our skins, and let us have a part of your rum, or we cannot [rely] on what you tell us for the future.&quot;

== Meeting with George Washington, 1770 ==

In 1770, Washington was traveling along the Muskingum River looking for lands suitable to be given to Virginia veterans in payment for their services. By chance, he found Guyasuta&#x27;s camp, and the two men had a pleasant reunion. Washington later wrote:
:&quot;In the Person of Kiashuta I found an old acquaintance...He expressd a satisfaction in seeing me and treated us with great kindness, giving us a Quarter of very fine Buffalo. He insisted upon our spending that Night with him, and...thankd me for saying that Peace &amp; friendship was the wish of the People of Virginia (with them) &amp; for recommending it to the Traders to deal with them upon a fair &amp; equitable footing; and then again express&#x27;d their desire of having a Trade opend with Virginia, &amp; that the Governor thereof might not only be made acquainted therewith, but of their friendly disposition towards the white People.&quot;

In October 1774, Guyasuta, passing through Philadelphia while on a mission from the tribes in the Illinois and Ohio country to Guy Johnson, superintendent of Indian affairs for the Northern Department, encountered Washington, who was in the city for the First Continental Congress.

== Meetings with David McClure and Sir William Johnson, 1772 ==

The failure of Pontiac&#x27;s War led Guyasuta, and other Native American leaders, to understand that negotiating with the white man had the potential to improve trade relations and confer some protection, as long as Native Americans adopted ways that Europeans regarded as &quot;civilized.&quot; Accordingly, Guyasuta purchased fine clothes and a carriage, and began to learn English, using Simon Girty as his interpreter until he became fluent in 1775. He traveled to cities in Pennsylvania and New York, went to scientific presentations, and promoted values and ideas he knew would be respected by colonial Americans. 

On August 18 1772, he met by chance with the newly-ordained Presbyterian missionary David McClure, on a Pennsylvania road. McClure was on his way to preach to the Lenape people, and later described the encounter in his diary:
:&quot;Aug. 18. Crossed the Laurel hanning, a pleasant stream which runs through Ligonier, &amp; rode to Col. Proctor&#x27;s. Here we found Kiahshutah, Chief of the Senecas, on his way to Philadelphia &amp; from thence Sr. Wm. Johnson&#x27;s, who, as his interpreter Simon Girty informed us, had sent for him...He was dressed in a scarlet cloth turned up with lace, &amp; a high gold laced hat, &amp; made a martial appearance. He had a very sensible countenance &amp; dignity of manners. His interpreter informed him of the business on which we were going. I asked him his opinion of it. He paused a few moments, &amp; replied that he was afraid it would not succeed; for said he, &#x27;the Indians are a roving people, &amp; they will not attend to your instructions; but take courage &amp; make trial. The King of the Delawares &amp; the warriors are now at home, &amp; you will see them.&#x27;&quot;

On November 11, the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; reported:
:&quot;On Saturday last Kayashuta, the Great Seneca Chief, returned to this city from Johnson Hall, where he has been on a visit to Sir William Johnson, of the greatest Importance to the Colonies. The Entertainment he received, when last here, at seeing a few Electrical Experiments, has so engaged his attention and admiration, that we are informed, his first Enquiry at his Return was, whether he could have another Opportunity of seeing Thunder and Lightning produced by human art? And we hear he is determined to attend Mr. Kinnersley&#x27;s lectures at the College on Thursday and Friday Evenings next.&quot;

== American Revolutionary War ==

At the outset of the American Revolutionary War, Guyasuta sided with the British, like most Iroquois, although he initially argued that the Seneca should remain neutral. At a conference at Fort Pitt in October 1775, Guyasuta offered to help implement the terms of surrender agreed to by the Shawnee at the end of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. At this conference, the American revolutionaries attempted to win Guyasuta to their cause but, he observed that he and other Native American leaders were hesitant, due to ongoing disputes among the rebel representatives. Another conference at Fort Pitt was called in July 1776 to enable Guyasuta, as the representative of the Six Nations in the Ohio and Allegheny valleys, to define his position in the conflict between England and the American colonies. &quot;I am appointed,&quot; said Guyasuta, &quot;by the Six Nations to take care of this country...and I desire you will not think of an expedition against Detroit [then in the possession of the British], for, I repeat, we will not suffer an army to pass through our country.&quot; Together with General Richard Butler, Guyasuta worked to persuade the Mingo to remain neutral, and in recognition of his services, the Continental Congress awarded him a silver gorget and a colonel&#x27;s commission. Guyasuta had no illusions that the British would make better allies than the American rebels. He referred to the revolution as &quot;an unnecessary war,&quot; adding, &quot;We must be fools indeed to imagine that they regard us or our interest.&quot;

Within a year, however, Guyasuta&#x27;s stance had changed, and he accompanied his nephew Cornplanter to the Siege of Fort Stanwix, where he took part in the Battle of Oriskany in August 1777. In December 1777, his former adopted son Simon Girty reported that he had killed settlers near Fort Ligonier, as described in a letter from Colonel John Gibson to George Washington: &quot;Simon Girty, a Messenger dispatched by General Hand to the Seneca towns on the Heads of the Allegeney, Returned here a few days agoe, he informs us Guashota a Chief of them had Returned from War, that he had killed four people near Legonier.&quot; 

In August and September 1779, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Brodhead directed a series of raids against the Senecas living in southwestern New York State. Brodhead and a contingent of soldiers and militia went from Fort Pitt, up the Allegheny River into New York, intending to drive the Seneca out of their villages. Most of the warriors were away fighting General John Sullivan, and Guyasuta led thirty Seneca warriors to oppose Brodhead. In a brief skirmish at Brokenstraw Creek, five Seneca warriors were killed before they fled. Guyasuta later appeared at Fort Niagara demanding a hundred soldiers to defend Seneca communities, but the British commander refused, and Brodhead&#x27;s men killed people, destroyed crops and burned over 130 Seneca homes without meeting any resistance.

On July 13 1782, in one of the final actions of the American Revolution, the settlement of Hannastown, Pennsylvania was attacked and destroyed by a British military detachment of sixty Canadian rangers from Fort Niagara and a hundred Seneca warriors led by Guyasuta. The population of the town was alerted by harvesters in the fields and took refuge in a blockhouse while the warriors destroyed the town. Guyasuta continued to raid farms and homesteads in the area for several days afterwards. In September, he led a war party to participate in the second siege of Fort Henry.

== Diplomatic missions, 1787-1793 ==

After the American Revolutionary War, the aging Guyasuta worked to establish peaceful relations with the new United States, as his nephew Cornplanter became an influential diplomatic figure. In 1787, an article in the &quot;Maryland Gazette&quot; reported that Guyasuta was visiting Philadelphia. Guyasuta was remembered widely for his attack on Hannastown five years earlier, and the sarcastic piece refers to this:
:&quot;PITTSBURGH, January 6. We are happy to have an opportunity of congratulating our fellow citizens on the arrival in this town, of the great, the mighty, and the warlike Giosoto the First, king of the Seneca nation; defender of Hannah&#x27;s-town; protector of the widow and orphan, &amp;c. &amp;c. There was an elegant entertainment (consisting of three gallons of whiskey and twenty pounds of flour) prepared for his majesty and retinue, which they enjoyed with an uncommon relish, as these articles have become exceedingly scarce within his majesty’s, Giosoto, dominions. His majesty amuses himself whilst he remains here, in walking about to view the curiosities of this place, in quaffing good whiskey; and smoaking tobacco and the bark of willow trees, through his curiously ornamented wooden pipe. As anecdotes of great men can never fail to be interesting, we shall not neglect to add, that his majesty was observed to be particularly fond of viewing the game of billiards.&quot;

In October 1790, Guyasuta, Cornplanter, Half-Town, Great Tree, and other Seneca leaders went to Philadelphia, staying until March 1791 while they met with federal and state officials to discuss food aid and other assistance for the Seneca people. During their visit, Guyasuta delivered an address to the Quakers of Philadelphia, seeking assistance and addressing them as the sons of &quot;Brother Onas&quot; (a term referring to William Penn):
:&quot;When I was young and strong, our country was full of game which the good Spirit sent for us to live upon...Hunting was then not tiresome; it was diversion; it was pleasure. When your fathers asked land from my nation, we gave it to them, for we had more than enough. Guyasuta was among the first people to say, &#x27;give land to our brother Onas for he wants it,&#x27; and [Guyasuta] has always been a friend to Onas and his children. But you are too far off to see him. Now he is grown old. He is very old, and he wonders at his own shadow; it has become so little. He has no children to take care of him and the game is driven away by the white people so that the young men must hunt all day long to find game for themselves to eat; they have nothing left for Guyasuta; and it is not Guyasuta only who is become old and feeble, there yet remain about thirty men of your old friends, who, unable to provide for themselves or to help one another, are become poor and are hungry and naked...I have no other friends but you, the children of our beloved Brother Onas.&quot;

In March, 1793 Guyasuta and Cornplanter were invited to Legionville, adjacent to the site of Guyasuta&#x27;s boyhood home of Logstown, to meet with General Anthony Wayne for peace talks, in an attempt to end the Northwest Indian War. As he saw his dream of a peaceful and strong Native American nation crumble, he turned to alcohol.

== Trial of Samuel Brady, 1793 ==

In 1791, Captain Samuel Brady led twenty-five Virginia Rangers in pursuit of twelve Delaware Indians who they said had been raiding white settlements in what was then Virginia and is now West Virginia. On March 9, they found the Indians at a place in Pennsylvania known as the Red Front Trading Post, where they were trading. Brady and his men killed four Delaware men and one Delaware woman, then returned to their Virginia homes. Brady evaded arrest for months until General Anthony Wayne persuaded him to turn himself in. Brady&#x27;s trial convened in Pittsburgh in May, 1793 and was much publicized. On May 25, Guyasuta entered the courtroom, walking with difficulty, using a walking stick and accompanied by his nephew Cornplanter. On seeing him, Brady and the jurors stood up in respect. Guyasuta took Brady’s hands and addressed the court, announcing that Brady was a good man, that the Indians he killed &quot;rode white men&#x27;s horses and were not friendly,&quot; and that they had hurt the Indians as well as the whites. He added that the Indians were thankful to Brady for saving them from those men. Immediately following this testimony, the jury voted to acquit Brady. After the trial, Brady&#x27;s attorney expressed his surprise to Guyasuta at the forcefulness of his testimony. Placing his hand on his heart, Guyasuta replied, &quot;Am I not the friend of Brady?&quot;

== Later life and death ==

Towards the end of his life, Guyasuta lived in poverty in a cabin outside Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. General James O&#x27;Hara purchased much of the land in that area in 1778, and offered Guyasuta a home on his estate, which Guyasuta accepted. Neville B. Craig remembered him as &quot;a stout active man.&quot; He was seriously ill by February 1, 1794, when Cornplanter wrote to Isaac Craig: &quot;He is alive &amp; that is all.&quot; According to one account, after Guyasuta had not been seen for several days, O’Hara found him dead on his cabin floor in 1794, and he was buried nearby with his rifle, tomahawk, knife, trinkets, and trophies in his coffin.

=== Burial controversy ===

William McCullough Darlington, who later purchased O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s estate, maintained that Guyasuta was buried there, however other sources claim that he was buried on the Cornplanter Tract (near Corydon, Pennsylvania). There is strong evidence that his grave is at Custaloga Town Scout Reservation, now a Boy Scout camp located along French Creek at the former site of Chief Custaloga&#x27;s village in French Creek Township, Pennsylvania. A stone monument to Guyasuta was erected by Charles William Heydrick near the supposed site of his burial in 1915. The monument stands in a Native American burial ground, owned by the Heydrick family since 1798. The land was donated to the Mercer County Historical Society in 1965. At the burial site is a broken headstone inscribed with &quot;GUY-A-SOOTER 1810,&quot; which was the date of Guyasuta&#x27;s death and burial, according to Charles Heydrick, who spoke to a local settler in 1819:
:&quot;John Martin, Jr., who could converse in the Indian tongue, informed me that he made the coffin and assisted in burying a chief. They placed in the coffin his camp kettle, filled with soup; his rifle, tomahawk, knife, trinkets, and trophies. I think they called him &#x27;Guyasooter.&#x27;&quot;
== Memorials and legacy ==

In Pittsburgh, he is honored, along with George Washington, in a large public sculpture by James A. West called &quot;Point of View&quot;, which overlooks Point State Park. A statue of Guyasuta, sculpted in 1915 by Charles Keck, was part of the North Side Point Bridge, built in 1917 and demolished in 1970. The sculpture was purchased for $1 million by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, which kept it and a matching sculpture of Christopher Gist at the foundation&#x27;s Pittsburgh headquarters. In 2016 the sculptures were relocated to a plaza on Art Rooney Avenue near Heinz Field.

A statue of Guyasuta stands at the intersection of Main and North Canal Streets in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. The statue and a drinking fountain for horses were donated to the city in 1896, as a centerpiece to the H. J. Heinz Memorial Plaza. The fountain and the cast-iron statue were hit by a car and destroyed in 1930, and the original mold was used to make a copy. The fountain was damaged again in the 1980s by a truck, and the statue was replaced with a bronze copy. A brass plaque at the base of the statue states that Guyasuta &quot;was probably buried in the area now occupied by the north end of the Highland Park Bridge.&quot;

The Allegheny Reservoir, the artificial lake created by the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River, has a beach and camping park named &quot;Kiasutha Recreation Area.&quot; Guyasuta Station was the name of the Sharpsburg railroad station, built in 1900. The Laurel Highlands Council of the Boy Scouts of America has a camp property near Sharpsburg named in his honor.

Since 2021, the Heinz History Center has sponsored an exhibit on the life and legacy of Guyasuta, at the Fort Pitt Museum.

<text>Teddy Ruxpin is an electronic children&#x27;s toy in the form of a talking bear-like creature known as an &#x27;Illiop&#x27;. The toy&#x27;s mouth and eyes move while he tells stories about his adventures played on an audio tape cassette deck built into his back. While the character itself was created by Ken Forsse, the talking toy was designed and built by Forsse’s Alchemy II, Inc. employees, including Larry Larsen and John Davies. Later versions have a digital cartridge in place of a cassette. 

At the peak of its popularity, Teddy Ruxpin became one of the best-selling toys of 1985 and 1986. The 2006 version was awarded the 2006 Animated Interactive Plush Toy of the Year award by &quot;Creative Child Magazine&quot;. A cartoon based on the characters debuted in 1986. Teddy&#x27;s extreme popularity in 1986 buoyed the controversial launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System, also distributed by Worlds of Wonder.

==Technology==
Conventional cassette tapes carry two audio tracks for stereo sound reproduction. Teddy Ruxpin&#x27;s cassettes use the left track for audio and the right track for a control data stream. The data stream controls the motors that move the eyes and mouth and can also redirect the audio signal to Grubby, who is an octopede and the companion toy, by means of a proprietary cable. This allows the two toys to engage in pre-recorded interactions. Grubby only works with the original WoW versions of Teddy Ruxpin.

If a normal audio cassette is played in either the second or third generation models of the original Teddy Ruxpin, this is detected and its right audio track is ignored and Teddy will not move. The production eject mechanism was designed by global design firm RKS Design. Early versions of the toy use three servo motors, but this was reduced to two and even one in later versions.

== History ==
After the September 1985 debut, various toy makers have produced Teddy Ruxpin over the years. The first was Worlds of Wonder from 1985 until its bankruptcy in 1988. The cut rights were then sold to Hasbro, and produced again from 1991 to 1996. Another version debuted in 1998 by Yes! Entertainment, and another version in 2006 by BackPack Toys, owned and operated by Robert Taylor. The most recent version was produced by Wicked Cool Toys.

Shortly after his debut, Teddy Ruxpin was dubbed the &quot;Official Spokesbear for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children&quot; in 1985.

===Worlds of Wonder===

Teddy Ruxpin was launched in 1985 by toy manufacturer Worlds of Wonder. Then came the companion toy Grubby, different outfits for Teddy and Grubby, and several other non-animatronic companion toys and characters. This includes two different versions of the bird-like Fobs (one orange, one purple) that are hand puppets with a sock-like, extendable neck. Other hand puppets are the larger Wooly What&#x27;s-It, three interchangeable Anythings (This, That, The Other), Tweeg, and L.B. The Bounder. 

Other items produced by Worlds of Wonder for Teddy Ruxpin are the Answer Box and Picture Show. Actress Joanna Kerns served as Teddy&#x27;s spokesperson shortly after its introduction, while at the height of her fame as Maggie Seaver on the ABC-TV sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

Teddy Ruxpin sales peaked in 1986. Worlds of Wonder launched a series of safety messages for children, with different partners including firefighters and the United States Lifesaving Association. WoW became the exclusive distributor for the launch of the smash hit Nintendo Entertainment System, based on leveraging the undeniable strength of Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag.

To retailers who were bitterly adamant against hearing the words &quot;video game&quot; after having survived the video game crash of 1983, WoW salesman Jim Whims distinctly recalled delivering an ultimatum: &quot;If you want to sell Teddy Ruxpin and you want to sell Lazer Tag, you&#x27;re gonna sell Nintendo as well. And if you feel that strongly about it, then you ought to just resign the line now.&quot; Historian Steven Kent wrote: &quot;Anyone who wanted to sell Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag, including Sears and Toys R Us, was going to hear about the Nintendo Entertainment System.&quot; WoW received windfall sales commissions from selling the NES, and $800 million in back orders for the Christmas season, mainly for Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag.

In 1987, Worlds of Wonder contracted with Wendy&#x27;s restaurants to feature a Teddy Ruxpin themed Kid&#x27;s Meal promotion. These are similar to the miniatures produced by Worlds of Wonder, except they are smaller and flocked. Teddy Ruxpin characters joined the Ice Capades program, which toured the country.

In 1987, management staff of Worlds of Wonder grossly overestimated the popularity and inventory requirements of Teddy Ruxpin, which was actually in declining demand and was dwarfed by the NES. The excessive parts orders for making Teddy Ruxpin overextended the company&#x27;s assets, and the situation was worsened when stock trades by company officers spooked investors.

In response to devaluation, WoW issued Non-Investment Grade Bonds, commonly known as junk bonds, in an effort to buoy itself. Although there is some contention as to whether this strategy would have helped, the attempt was made moot by the 1987 stock market crash. Worlds of Wonder filed for bankruptcy protection and was liquidated in 1988. They went through a series of layoffs. The creditors continued to operate the company in receivership until finally closing in late 1990. By 1991, Worlds of Wonder had closed and the remaining assets were liquidated.

===Playskool===
In 1991, the Teddy Ruxpin toy line was bought by Hasbro, which produced him under their Playskool line until 1996 using the redesign that had been implemented by WoW. This design is smaller and uses cartridges that resemble 8-track tapes, instead of cassette tapes.

===Yes! Entertainment===
From 1993 to 1995, Yes! Entertainment responded to Teddy Ruxpin with an &quot;interactive video&quot; animatronic toy released under the branding &quot;TV Teddy&quot;. The TV Teddy system consists of a series of specially encoded VHS cassettes, an RF-transmitter that relays signals encoded on the video track to the toy, and an animatronic RF-receiver consisting of a loudspeaker, and two servos which provide much-simplified eye and mouth movements compared to both the WoW and Playskool versions. The VHS cassettes consist of original opening content specifically designed for Teddy to interact with, followed by previously-released videos (among them &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot; and titles from Family Home Entertainment) which are encoded with additional content for the animatronic toy. 

In 1998, Yes! brought Teddy Ruxpin back to stores for a third time. The toy&#x27;s size is largely the same as the Playskool version. Yes! returned to using the standard cassette tapes. A small Beanie Baby version of the toy is boxed with the Yes! Teddy Ruxpin based on the popularity of Beanie Babies at the time. This venture was short-lived, however, as Yes! Entertainment&#x27;s corporate management and financial troubles ultimately resulted in Alchemy II withdrawing the licensing for Teddy.

===BackPack Toys===
In 2005, BackPack Toys announced a fourth version of Teddy Ruxpin, which replaced the audio tapes with digital ROM cartridges.

===Wicked Cool Toys===
Wicked Cool Toys began the production of a new Teddy Ruxpin in late 2017. This Teddy Ruxpin does not come with physical cartridges, instead being programmed with 3 stories inside of the toy. The rest of the stories are available for purchase on a mobile app.

In May 2018, Alchemy and The Jim Henson Company made a deal to make a new &quot;Teddy Ruxpin&quot; series, animated as digital puppetry, aimed at preschoolers. The series was eventually scrapped. 

In September 2021, DJ2 Entertainment picked up the television and film rights to Teddy Ruxpin.

==Book and cassette episode list==
===Worlds of Wonder===
Worlds of Wonder produced the largest number of stories:
===Other===
Worlds of Wonder created two devices that work only with Teddy Ruxpin: the Picture Show and Answer Box. Neither of these work with Grubby. The Picture Show cassettes use slide wheels, similar to the View Master:
*&quot;Big Little Wooly&quot;
*&quot;Gimmick Learns A Lesson&quot;
*&quot;The Great Grundo Groundrace&quot;
*&quot;Teddy &amp; The Surf Grunges&quot;
*&quot;Teddy&#x27;s Underwater Rescue&quot;
*&quot;Tweeg&#x27;s Lemonade Stand&quot;
*&quot;Wedding In Grundo&quot;

The Answer Box cassettes are these:
*&quot;Color My World&quot;
*&quot;Counting is Fun&quot;
*&quot;Easy as ABC&quot;
*&quot;Just About The Size Of It&quot;
*&quot;Learn About Opposites&quot;
*&quot;Shapes are Everywhere&quot;
*&quot;Up, Down and All Around&quot;

==Voice actors==
Phil Baron was the voice actor on all tapes and on the TV show &quot;The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin&quot;. He left the entertainment industry in the 1990s to become a cantor. Baron is currently the only voice actor officially associated with the property, as Teddy Ruxpin has been the only character in the storyline requiring updated voice recordings for new projects. Will Ryan voiced Grubby in the 1980s and returned as Grubby in the early 1990s for a musical project.

Tony Pope was the original voice of Newton Gimmick. He and other AlchemyII voice actors in the 1980s did not reprise their roles in the television series because production was moved to Canada, starring John Stocker as Gimmick. Baron and Ryan provided the voices of Teddy and Grubby, respectively, in every project from 1985 up until Ryan&#x27;s death in 2021. 

Ryan voiced the character of Tweeg in the adventure series. John Koensgen voiced Tweeg for the television series. Katie Leigh and Russi Taylor did the voices of Princess Aruzia and Leota the Woodsprite, respectively, on the book-and-tapes. For the TV series, Holly Larocque and Abby Hagyard took over the roles.

==&quot;The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin&quot;==

&quot;The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin&quot; is a television series that ran from 1986 to 1987. In it, Teddy Ruxpin leaves his homeland in Rillonia with his friend Grubby in search of adventure. They meet an inventor named Newton Gimmick, who accompanies them on their quest for the Treasure of Grundo. The trio unexpectedly find six crystals with different meanings and powers. These crystals enable the Monsters and Villains Organization (MAVO) to have absolute power over the land. 

Their leader, Quellor, wants to make sure that an Illiop never possesses the crystals. Elsewhere, a less pronounced threat routinely besieges the trio: the wannabe villain Jack W. Tweeg, a greedy troll intending to join MAVO. The sixty-five episode series unfolds gradually, as the trio meet interesting and often friendly creatures while visiting intriguing lands and going on wondrous adventures.

==Unofficial tape injunction==
At least two other companies (Vector Intercontinental and Veritel Learning Systems) produced tapes that work with the Teddy Ruxpin toy. Worlds of Wonder successfully sued them in 1986, claiming the effect these tapes had on Teddy were too similar to the results of playing the proprietary recordings, and the courts in Ohio and Texas ordered the infringing tapes off the market.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Brigsby Bear&quot;, a 2017 American film, featured an animatronic bear suit, similar to the one in the animatronic pilot for &quot;The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin&quot;. In the plot of the film, the suit is used in the production of a children&#x27;s television series. The suit&#x27;s mouth and eyes move when it plays a tape, just like the original toy. It is shown accepting both compact cassette and VHS tapes, both technologies that the toy utilized.

The 2019 comedy-horror film &quot;Camp Wedding&quot; featured a possessed Teddy Ruxpin toy as a central plot point. The prop was an authentic Teddy Ruxpin toy, modified to speak the lines, as well as to hide its logo. The toy is visible at the top of the film&#x27;s poster.

Teddy Ruxpin is mentioned in the 2012 comedy film &quot;Ted&quot;.

A Teddy Ruxpin toy appears in the 2021 film &quot;House of Gucci&quot;.

A Teddy Ruxpin toy appears in Season 7 Episode 10 of &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;.

<doc id="1178938" wikidata="Q1979625" url="?curid=1178938" title="Last Glacial Maximum">
<text>The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), also referred to as the Last Glacial Coldest Period, was the most recent time during the Last Glacial Period where ice sheets were at their greatest extent between 26,000 and 20,000 years ago. 
Ice sheets covered much of Northern North America, Northern Europe, and Asia and profoundly affected Earth&#x27;s climate by causing a major expansion of deserts, along with a large drop in sea levels.

Based on changes in position of ice sheet margins dated via terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides and radiocarbon dating, growth of ice sheets in the southern hemisphere commenced 33,000 years ago and maximum coverage has been estimated to have occurred sometime between 26,500 years ago and 20,000 years ago. After this, deglaciation caused an abrupt rise in sea level. Decline of the West Antarctica ice sheet occurred between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, consistent with evidence for another abrupt rise in the sea level about 14,500 years ago. Glacier fluctuations around the Strait of Magellan suggest the peak in glacial surface area was constrained to between 25,200 and 23,100 years ago.

There are no agreed dates for the beginning and end of the LGM, and researchers select dates depending on their criteria and the data set consulted. Jennifer French, an archeologist specialising in the European Palaeolithic, dates its onset at 27,500 years ago, with ice sheets at their maximum by around 26,000 years ago and deglaciation commencing between 20,000 and 19,000 years ago. The LGM is referred to in Britain as the Dimlington [[Stadial]], dated to between 31,000 and 16,000 years ago.

==Glacial climate==
The average global temperature about 21,000 years ago was about 6 °C (11 °F) colder than today. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), permanent summer ice covered about 8% of Earth&#x27;s surface and 25% of the land area during the last glacial maximum. The USGS also states that sea level was about lower than in present times (2012). When comparing to the present, the average global temperature was for the 2013–2017 period. As of 2012 about 3.1% of Earth&#x27;s surface and 10.7% of the land area is covered in year-round ice.

Carbon sequestration in the highly stratified and productive Southern Ocean was essential in producing the LGM. The formation of an ice sheet or ice cap requires both prolonged cold and precipitation (snow). Hence, despite having temperatures similar to those of glaciated areas in North America and Europe, East Asia remained unglaciated except at higher elevations. This difference was because the ice sheets in Europe produced extensive anticyclones above them. These anticyclones generated air masses that were so dry on reaching Siberia and Manchuria that precipitation sufficient for the formation of glaciers could never occur (except in Kamchatka where these westerly winds lifted moisture from the Sea of Japan). The relative warmth of the Pacific Ocean due to the shutting down of the Oyashio Current and the presence of large east–west mountain ranges were secondary factors that prevented the development of continental glaciation in Asia.

All over the world, climates at the Last Glacial Maximum were cooler and almost everywhere drier. In extreme cases, such as South Australia and the Sahel, rainfall could have been diminished by up to 90% compared to the present, with flora diminished to almost the same degree as in glaciated areas of Europe and North America. Even in less affected regions, rainforest cover was greatly diminished, especially in West Africa where a few refugia were surrounded by tropical grasslands. The Amazon rainforest was split into two large blocks by extensive savanna, and the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia probably were similarly affected, with deciduous forests expanding in their place except on the east and west extremities of the Sundaland shelf. Only in Central America and the Chocó region of Colombia did tropical rainforests remain substantially intact – probably due to the extraordinarily heavy rainfall of these regions. Most of the world&#x27;s deserts expanded. Exceptions were in what is the present-day Western United States, where changes in the jet stream brought heavy rain to areas that are now desert and large pluvial lakes formed, the best known being Lake Bonneville in Utah. This also occurred in Afghanistan and Iran, where a major lake formed in the Dasht-e Kavir.

In Australia, shifting sand dunes covered half the continent, while the Chaco and Pampas in South America became similarly dry. Present-day subtropical regions also lost most of their forest cover, notably in eastern Australia, the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, and southern China, where open woodland became dominant due to much drier conditions. In northern China – unglaciated despite its cold climate – a mixture of grassland and tundra prevailed, and even here, the northern limit of tree growth was at least 20° farther south than today. In the period before the LGM, many areas that became completely barren desert were wetter than they are today, notably in southern Australia, where Aboriginal occupation is believed to coincide with a wet period between 40,000 and 60,000 years Before Present (BP). In New Zealand and neighbouring regions of the Pacific, temperatures may have been further depressed during part of the LGM by the world&#x27;s most recent supervolcanic eruption, the Oruanui eruption, approximately 25,500 years BP.

However, it is estimated that during the LGM, low-to-mid latitude land surfaces at low elevation cooled on average by 5.8 °C relative to their present-day temperatures, based on an analysis of noble gases dissolved in groundwater rather than examinations of species abundances that have been used in the past.

== World impact ==
During the Last Glacial Maximum, much of the world was cold, dry, and inhospitable, with frequent storms and a dust-laden atmosphere. The dustiness of the atmosphere is a prominent feature in ice cores; dust levels were as much as 20 to 25 times greater than they are in the present. This was probably due to a number of factors: reduced vegetation, stronger global winds, and less precipitation to clear dust from the atmosphere. The massive sheets of ice locked away water, lowering the sea level, exposing continental shelves, joining land masses together, and creating extensive coastal plains. The ice sheets also changed the atmospheric circulation, causing the northern Pacific and Atlantic oceans to cool and produce more clouds, which amplified the global cooling as the clouds reflected even more sunlight. During the LGM, 21,000 years ago, the sea level was about 125 meters (about 410 feet) lower than it is today. Across most of the globe, the hydrological cycle slowed down, explaining increased aridity in many regions of the world.

=== Africa and the Middle East ===
In Africa and the Middle East, many smaller mountain glaciers formed, and the Sahara and other sandy deserts were greatly expanded in extent. The Atlantic deep sea sediment core V22-196, extracted off the coast of Senegal, shows a major southward expansion of the Sahara.

The Persian Gulf averages about 35 metres in depth and the seabed between Abu Dhabi and Qatar is even shallower, being mostly less than 15 metres deep. For thousands of years the Ur-Shatt (a confluence of the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers) provided fresh water to the Gulf, as it flowed through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman. Bathymetric data suggests there were two palaeo-basins in the Persian Gulf. The central basin may have approached an area of 20,000 km2, comparable at its fullest extent to lakes such as Lake Malawi in Africa. Between 12,000 and 9,000 years ago much of the Gulf&#x27;s floor was not covered by water, only being flooded by the sea after 8,000 years BP.

It is estimated that annual average temperatures in Southern Africa were 6 °C lower than at present during the Last Glacial Maximum. This temperature drop alone would however not have been enough to generate widespread glaciation or permafrost in the Drakensberg Mountains or the Lesotho Highlands. Seasonal freezing of the ground in the Lesotho Highlands might have reached depths of 2 meters or more below the surface. A few small glaciers did however develop during the LGM, in particular in south-facing slopes. In the Hex River Mountains, in the Western Cape, block streams and terraces found near the summit of Matroosberg evidences past periglacial activity which likely occurred during the LGM. Palaeoclimatological proxies indicate the region around Boomplaas Cave was wetter, with increased winter precipitation. The region of the Zambezi River catchment was colder relative to present and the local drop in mean temperature was seasonally uniform.

On the island of Mauritius in the Mascarenhas Archipelago, open wet forest vegetation dominated, contrasting with the dominantly closed-stratified-tall-forest state of Holocene Mauritian forests.

=== Asia ===

There were ice sheets in modern Tibet (although scientists continue to debate the extent to which the Tibetan Plateau was covered with ice) as well as in Baltistan and Ladakh. In Southeast Asia, many smaller mountain glaciers formed, and permafrost covered Asia as far south as Beijing. Because of lowered sea levels, many of today&#x27;s islands were joined to the continents: the Indonesian islands as far east as Borneo and Bali were connected to the Asian continent in a landmass called Sundaland. Palawan was also part of Sundaland, while the rest of the Philippine Islands formed one large island separated from the continent only by the Sibutu Passage and the Mindoro Strait.

The environment along the coast of South China was not very different from that of the present day, featuring moist subtropical evergreen forests, despite sea levels in the South China Sea being about 100 metres lower than the present day.

=== Australasia ===
The Australian mainland, New Guinea, Tasmania and many smaller islands comprised a single land mass. This continent is now sometimes referred to as Sahul. In the Bonaparte Gulf of northwestern Australia, sea levels were about 125 metres lower than present. Interior Australia saw widespread aridity, evidenced by extensive dune activity and falling lake levels. Eastern Australia experienced two nadirs in temperature. Lacustrine sediments from North Stradbroke Island in coastal Queensland indicated humid conditions. Data from Little Llangothlin Lagoon likewise indicate the persistence of rainforests in eastern Australia at this time. Rivers maintained their sinuous form in southeastern Australia and there was increased aeolian deposition of sediment in compared to today. The Flinders Ranges likewise experienced humid conditions. In southwestern Western Australia, forests disappeared during the LGM.

Between Sahul and Sundaland – a peninsula of South East Asia that comprised present-day Malaysia and western and northern Indonesia – there remained an archipelago of islands known as Wallacea. The water gaps between these islands, Sahul and Sundaland were considerably narrower and fewer in number than in the present day.

The two main islands of New Zealand, along with associated smaller islands, were joined as one landmass. Virtually all of the Southern Alps were under permanent ice cover, with alpine glaciers extending from them into much of the surrounding high country.

=== Europe ===
Northern Europe was largely covered by ice, with the southern boundary of the ice sheets passing through Germany and Poland. This ice extended northward to cover Svalbard and Franz Josef Land and northeastward to occupy the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, and Novaya Zemlya, ending at the Taymyr Peninsula in what is now northwestern Siberia. Warming commenced in northern latitudes around 20,000 years ago, but it was limited and considerable warming did not take place until around 14,600 year ago.

In northwestern Russia, the Fennoscandian ice sheet reached its LGM extent approximately 17,000 years ago, about five thousand years later than in Denmark, Germany and Western Poland. Outside the Baltic Shield, and in Russia in particular, the LGM ice margin of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet was highly lobate. The main LGM lobes of Russia followed the Dvina, Vologda and Rybinsk basins respectively. Lobes originated as result of ice following shallow topographic depressions filled with a soft sediment substrate. The northern Ural region was covered in periglacial steppes.

Permafrost covered Europe south of the ice sheet down to as far south as present-day Szeged in Southern Hungary. Ice covered the whole of Iceland. In addition, ice covered Ireland along with roughly the northern half of the British Isles with the southern boundary of the ice sheet running approximately from the south of Wales to the north east of England, and then across the now submerged land of Doggerland to Denmark. Central Europe had isolated pockets of relative warmth corresponding to hydrothermally active areas, which served as refugia for taxa not adapted to extremely cold climates.

In the Cantabrian Mountains of the northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula, which in the present day have no permanent glaciers, the LGM led to a local glacial recession as a result of increased aridity caused by the growth of other ice sheets farther to the east and north, which drastically limited annual snowfall over the mountains of northwestern Spain. The Cantabrian alpine glaciers had previously expanded between approximately 60,000 and 40,000 years ago during a local glacial maximum in the region.

In northeastern Italy, in the region around Lake Fimon, &quot;Artemisia&quot;-dominated semideserts, steppes, and meadow-steppes replaced open boreal forests at the start of the LGM, specifically during Heinrich Stadial 3. The overall climate of the region became both drier and colder.

In the Sar Mountains, the glacial equilibrium-line altitude was about 450 metres lower than in the Holocene. In Greece, steppe vegetation predominated.

Megafaunal abundance in Europe peaked around 27,000 and 21,000 BP; this bountifulness was attributable to the cold stadial climate.

=== North America ===

In Greenland, the difference between LGM temperatures and present temperatures was twice as great during winter as during summer. Greenhouse gas and insolation forcings dominated temperature changes in northern Greenland, whereas Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability was the dominant influence on southern Greenland&#x27;s climate. Illorsuit Island was exclusively covered by cold-based glaciers.

Eastern Beringia was extremely cold and dry. July air temperatures in northern Alaska and Yukon were about 2-3 °C lower compared to today. Equilibrium line altitudes in Alaska suggest summer temperatures were 2-5 °C compared to preindustrial. Sediment core analysis from Lone Spruce Pond in southwestern Alaska show it was a pocket of relative warmth.

Following a preceding period of relative retreat from 52,000 to 40,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet grew rapidly at the onset of the LGM until it covered essentially all of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains and extended roughly to the Missouri and Ohio Rivers, and eastward to Manhattan, reaching a total maximum volume of around 26.5 to 37 million cubic kilometres. At its peak, the Laurentide Ice Sheet reached 3.2 km in height around Keewatin Dome and about 1.7-2.1 km along the Plains divide. In addition to the large Cordilleran Ice Sheet in Canada and Montana, alpine glaciers advanced and (in some locations) ice caps covered much of the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains further south. Latitudinal gradients were so sharp that permafrost did not reach far south of the ice sheets except at high elevations. Glaciers forced the early human populations who had originally migrated from northeast Siberia into refugia, reshaping their genetic variation by mutation and drift. This phenomenon established the older haplogroups found among Native Americans, and later migrations are responsible for northern North American haplogroups.

In southeastern North America, between the southern Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, there was an enclave of unusually warm climate.

=== South America ===
In the Southern Hemisphere, the Patagonian Ice Sheet covered the whole southern third of Chile and adjacent areas of Argentina. On the western side of the Andes the ice sheet reached sea level as far north as in the 41 degrees south at Chacao Channel. The western coast of Patagonia was largely glaciated, but some authors have pointed out the possible existence of ice-free refugia for some plant species. On the eastern side of the Andes, glacier lobes occupied the depressions of Seno Skyring, Seno Otway, Inútil Bay, and Beagle Channel. On the Straits of Magellan, ice reached as far as Segunda Angostura.
During the LGM, valley glaciers in the southern Andes (38–43° S) merged and descended from the Andes occupying lacustrine and marine basins where they spread out forming large piedmont glacier lobes. Glaciers extended about 7 km west of the modern Llanquihue Lake, but not more than 2 to 3 km south of it. Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina was also glaciated by the same time. Over most of the Chiloé Archipelago, glacier advance peaked 26,000 years ago, forming a long north–south moraine system along the eastern coast of Chiloé Island (41.5–43° S). By that time the glaciation at the latitude of Chiloé was of ice sheet type contrasting to the valley glaciation found further north in Chile.

Despite glacier advances much of the area west of Llanquihue Lake was still ice-free during the Last Glacial Maximum. During the coldest period of the Last Glacial Maximum vegetation at this location was dominated by Alpine herbs in wide open surfaces. The global warming that followed caused a slow change in vegetation towards a sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by &quot;Nothofagus&quot; species. Within this parkland vegetation Magellanic moorland alternated with &quot;Nothofagus&quot; forest, and as warming progressed even warm-climate trees began to grow in the area. It is estimated that the tree line was depressed about 1,000 m relative to present day elevations during the coldest period, but it rose gradually until 19,300 years ago. At that time a cold reversal caused a replacement of much of the arboreal vegetation with Magellanic moorland and Alpine species. On Isla Grande de Chiloé, Magellanic moorland and closed-canopy &quot;Nothofagus&quot; forests were both present during the LGM, but the former disappeared by the late LGM.

Little is known about the extent of glaciers during Last Glacial Maximum north of the Chilean Lake District. To the north, in the dry Andes of Central and the Last Glacial Maximum is associated with increased humidity and the verified advance of at least some mountain glaciers. Montane glaciers in the northern Andes reached their peak extent approximately 27,000 years ago. In northwestern Argentina, pollen deposits record the altitudinal descent of the treeline during the LGM.

Amazonia was much drier than in the present. &quot;δ&quot;D values from plant waxes from the LGM are significantly more enriched than those in the present and those dating back to MIS 3, evidencing this increased aridity. Eastern Brazil was also affected; the site of Guanambi in Bahia was much drier than today.

===Atlantic Ocean===
AMOC was weaker and more shallow during the LGM. Sea surface temperatures in the western subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic were around 5 °C colder compared to today. Intermediate depth waters of the North Atlantic were better ventilated during the LGM by Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) relative to its present-day ventilation by upper North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). GNAIW was nutrient poor compared to present day upper NADW. Below GNAIW, southern source bottom water that was very rich in nutrients filled the deep North Atlantic.

Due to the presence of immense ice sheets in Europe and North America, continental weathering flux into the North Atlantic was reduced, as measured by the increased proportion of radiogenic isotopes in neodymium isotope ratios.

There is controversy whether upwelling off the Moroccan coast was stronger during the LGM compared to today. Though coccolith size increases in &quot;Calcidiscus leptoporus&quot; suggest stronger trade winds during the LGM caused there to be increased coastal upwelling of the northwestern coast of Africa, planktonic foraminiferal δ13C records show upwelling and primary productivity were not enhanced during the LGM except in transient intervals around 23,200 and 22,300 BP.

In the western South Atlantic, where Antarctic Intermediate Water forms, sinking particle flux was heightened as a result of increased dust flux during the LGM and sustained export productivity. The increased sinking particle flux removed neodymium from shallow waters, producing an isotopic ratio change.

===Pacific Ocean===
On the Island of Hawaii, geologists have long recognized deposits formed by glaciers on Mauna Kea during recent ice ages. The latest work indicates that deposits of three glacial episodes since 150,000 to 200,000 years ago are preserved on the volcano. Glacial moraines on the volcano formed about 70,000 years ago and from about 40,000 to 13,000 years ago. If glacial deposits were formed on Mauna Loa, they have long since been buried by younger lava flows.

Low sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) in the East China Sea during the LGM suggests the Kuroshio Current was reduced in strength relative to the present. Abyssal Pacific overturning was weaker during the LGM than in the present day, although it was temporarily stronger during some intervals of ice sheet retreat. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was strong during the LGM. Evidence suggests that the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone in the eastern Pacific was weaker than it is in the present day, likely as a result of increased oxygen concentrations in seawater permitted by cooler ocean water temperatures, though it was similar in spatial extent.

The outflow of North Pacific Intermediate Water through the Tasman Sea was stronger during the LGM.

In the Great Barrier Reef along the coast of Queensland, reef development shifted seaward due to the precipitous drop in sea levels, reaching a maximum distance from the present coastline as sea levels approached their lowest levels around 20,700-20,500 years ago. Microbial carbonate deposition in the Great Barrier Reef was enhanced due to low atmospheric CO2 levels.

=== Indian Ocean ===
The deep waters of the Indian Ocean were significantly less oxygenated during the LGM compared to the Middle Holocene. The deep South Indian Ocean in particular was an enormous carbon sink, partially explaining the very low &quot;p&quot;CO2 of the LGM. The intermediate waters of the southeastern Arabian Sea were poorly ventilated relative to today because of the weakened thermohaline circulation.

===Southern Ocean===
Evidence from sediment cores in the Scotia Sea suggests the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was weaker during the LGM than during the Holocene. The Antarctic Polar Front (APF) was located much farther to the north compared to its present-day location. Studies suggest it could have been placed as far north as 43°S, reaching into the southern Indian Ocean.

==Late Glacial Period==
The Late Glacial Period followed the LGM and preceded the Holocene, which started around 11,700 years ago.

<doc id="1178948" wikidata="Q280212" url="?curid=1178948" title="USS Jallao">
<text>USS &quot;Jallao&quot; (SS-368), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the jallao, a pearl-white haemulonid food fish of the Gulf of Mexico.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Jallao&quot; was launched by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 12 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Oliver G. Kirk, and commissioned on 8 July 1944.

==Operational history==
After spending most of July in training operations, &quot;Jallao&quot; departed Manitowoc 26 July for Chicago, where she was loaded into a floating dry dock for the long trip down the Mississippi to New Orleans. She subsequently departed New Orleans 6 August, and steamed through the Panama Canal to the Pacific and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 September.

=== First patrol, October – December 1944 ===
Following additional training the submarine sailed 9 October for her first war patrol, operating with and in a coordinated attack group known as &quot;Clarey&#x27;s Crushers&quot;. At first the submarines proceeded toward Luzon Strait, but during the Battle of Leyte Gulf late in October, they were directed to take up scouting positions between the Philippines and Japan to cut off Japanese cripples struggling home after their devastating defeat at the Battle off Cape Engaño.

On the evening of 25 October &quot;Jallao&quot; picked up damaged light cruiser on radar and moved to attack. She fired seven torpedoes; three hit the Japanese warship, sinking it. Future United States federal judge Jack B. Weinstein was in charge of the submarine&#x27;s radar when the submarine located the cruiser.

After this notable success on her maiden patrol, &quot;Jallao&quot; continued her search until 28 November, returning to Majuro 10 December.

=== Second, third, and fourth patrols, January – September 1945 ===

&quot;Jallao&quot; sailed for the Yellow Sea for her second war patrol 6 January 1945. The decimated Japanese merchant marine offered few targets. However, she spotted a convoy on 5 March. During the attack, she had a close call when an enemy escort trying to ram her damaged her periscope. Two days later she sailed for Midway, arriving 26 March.

After repairs, the submarine departed Midway 20 April for her third war patrol and was assigned aircraft lifeguard duty off Marcus Island. Responding to reports of flyers in the water north of the island, on 9 May &quot;Jallao&quot; braved shore batteries to move in and pick up five men in a raft, delivering them safely to Saipan on 12 May. She then departed for the coast of Japan and more lifeguard duty as American heavy bombers stepped up their attacks on the home islands. She arrived at Pearl Harbor 13 June.

After advanced training in the Marianas, &quot;Jallao&quot; departed Guam 31 July to patrol the Sea of Japan. On this, her fourth and final patrol, the submarine sank the 6,000-ton freighter &quot;Timoko Maru&quot; on 11 August (19 survivors were found by on 21 August). Four days later hostilities ended, and the ship sailed via Guam to San Francisco, where she arrived 28 September. She was decommissioned at Mare Island 30 September 1946, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

=== 1953–1956 ===

&quot;Jallao&quot;″s home port was changed to New London in July 1953, for a GUPPY IIA conversion in which she was streamlined and equipped with snorkeling gear and new electric equipment. She was recommissioned on 4 December 1953. After shakedown in the San Diego area, the submarine departed 12 April for the East Coast, steaming via the Panama Canal to Norfolk, Virginia

Joining Submarine Squadron 6, &quot;Jallao&quot; operated out of Halifax, Nova Scotia during 1954, training with Canadian and American antisubmarine units. In January and February 1955, she took part in fleet exercises in the Caribbean, returning to Norfolk 4 March.

&quot;Jallao&quot;″s home port was changed to New London in July 1955 and she got underway with British submarine 7 August to take part in Joint Exercise &quot;New Broom IV&quot;. Following this operation, &quot;Jallao&quot; was deployed to the 6th Fleet and departed for the Mediterranean 9 November 1955. In the months that followed, she helped train Italian Navy ships and took part in fleet exercises, beginning the long voyage home in mid-January 1956. The ship steamed through the Suez Canal, visited several countries of eastern and southern Africa, and crossed the South Atlantic to take part in exercises with Uruguayan and Brazilian destroyers. The veteran submarine returned to New London 16 April.

=== 1957–1967 ===
After having installed the latest in electronic gear, &quot;Jallao&quot; resumed operations in January 1957. Combined fleet exercises in the Caribbean occupied her through February; and, after coastal antisubmarine operations, she arrived Boston late in July for a short midshipman training cruise. September and October were spent in the North Atlantic on a NATO exercise, as the submarine helped strengthen the armed forces of the Atlantic Allies. She returned to New London 24 October 1957.

&quot;Jallao&quot; spent most of 1958 on training exercises off the Atlantic Coast, taking part in a combined antisubmarine exercise in the North Atlantic in September. 1959 was spent largely in equipment development work and training with the Submarine School at New London.

The ship got underway 20 January 1960 for exercises in the Caribbean, returning 19 February. The latter part of the year was spent in training out of Bermuda. From 9 January to 24 March 1961, the veteran submarine carried out special training operations off Scotland, and operated with Canadian ships off Halifax during that summer. The remainder of the year was spent in the New London area.

&quot;Jallao&quot; began 1962 with her second Mediterranean cruise, sailing 2 January and exercising with the vital 6th Fleet in the troubled area until 7 May. The last four months of the year were spent in extensive modernization and repairs at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Through 1963 and 1964, the boat took part in training cruises to the Caribbean, served in submarine school training, and participated in equipment evaluation work.

On 3 January 1965, she departed for a four-month 6th Fleet deployment. She returned 1 May for submarine warfare tactics and submarine school operations out of New London. &quot;Jallao&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until 1974.

On 26 June 1974, &quot;Jallao&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the US Naval Register, and transferred (sold) under the terms of the Security Assistance Program to Spain. The submarine was commissioned into the Spanish Navy as &quot;Narciso Monturiol&quot; (S-35), named after Narcís Monturiol.
&quot;Monturiol&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December 1984 and scuttled off Cartagena, Spain, in 1985.

== Awards ==
&quot;Jallao&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>A teacup dog is a dog that is smaller than a typical dog of that breed. Other terms may include &quot;pocket dog&quot;, &quot;tiny dog&quot;, and &quot;micro dog&quot;. Teacup dogs are usually bred by mating two runts together.

==Description==
Teacup dogs have no exact size however they are smaller than the standard for their breed and often weigh under .

===Teacup breeds===
Teacup dogs typically belong to the following breeds: Yorkshire Terrier, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Maltese, Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Pug.

==Health concerns==
Multiple health issues are associated with runts and teacup dogs. They may suffer from hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); hydrocephaly due to the small size of the skull; portosystemic shunts; periodontitis and gingivitis due to the small jaw leading to problems with tooth growth; tracheal collapse; degenerative mitral valve disease; luxating patella and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease; and hypothermia.

Their small size can lead to problems with the dosage of certain medications such as flea treatment as most flea treatments and other anti-parasite medications are only labeled as suitable for use in dogs over 5 lbs (2 kg).

<text>Sidney Shachnow ( – ) was a Jewish American Holocaust survivor who attained the rank of major general in United States Army. He retired in 1994, after almost 40 years of active service.

==Biography==

===Surviving the Holocaust, a concentration camp, and anti-Semitism===
Sid Shachnow was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, on November 23, 1934. At the age of seven, Shachnow was imprisoned in the Kovno Ghetto during World War II because his family was Jewish. For three years, he endured brutalities and lost almost every single one of his extended family members. To increase his prospects of survival, young Shachnow performed heavy manual labor under harsh conditions. He narrowly escaped death only days before Kovno&#x27;s gruesome &quot;Children&#x27;s Action&quot;, of March 27–28, 1944, when Nazi troops rounded up all children in the camp and marched them to The Ninth Fort for execution or to Auschwitz to be gassed. After escaping the ghetto, Shachnow lived in hiding for months, almost dying from starvation and malnutrition. Shachnow fled west after the Soviets invaded Kaunas from the Nazis and began to implement Communism. His 2,000-mile, six-month journey across Europe, mostly on foot, took him across Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, and finally to American-occupied Nuremberg, Germany, where he hoped to obtain a visa to the United States. To make a living in war-torn Nuremberg, Shachnow resorted to pirating black market contraband such as nylon stockings and chocolate. It was during this time that he learned to speak German.

===Visa and immigration===
In 1950, Shachnow obtained a visa and immigrated to Salem, Massachusetts, where he attended school for the first time in his life. He took English lessons and worked in the evenings after school to help support the family financially. Just before graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army on January 10, 1955. As a Sergeant First Class, he entered Officer Candidate School and received his commission in the U.S. Army Infantry on April 12, 1960.

===Special Forces and Vietnam===
In 1962 he volunteered for the United States Army Special Forces, also known as the &quot;Green Berets&quot;, where he served for the next thirty-two years. After joining Special Forces, Shachnow was promoted to captain and assigned as commander of Detachment A-121, his group was deployed to Vietnam&#x27;s An Long Camp near the Cambodian border along the Mekong River.

Shachnow earned his first Silver Star for combat action there as well as a Purple Heart. He was shot in the leg and the arm simultaneously. After being shot, he applied a tourniquet to his leg and continued to fight, lead and care for his men in battle. He recovered from his wounds and returned home only to be diagnosed with the tuberculosis, typhoid fever and several other illnesses from which he eventually recovered.

After recovering, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Nebraska, and the Army promoted him to major. He couldn&#x27;t attend the graduation ceremonies; he received deployment orders for his second tour to Vietnam. The army assigned Shachnow to the 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles, where he earned his second Silver Star for gallantry in action after escaping death several times.

===Cold War, Berlin, Delta Force===
In the 1970s he served as commander of Det-A, Berlin Brigade, a clandestine unit of Cold War Special Forces soldiers on high alert 24-hours a day. This covert unit was made up of selectively trained and language qualified members of Special Forces, as well as many Eastern European immigrants who brought much-needed culture, geographical and language skills to the assignment. Their missions were classified; they dressed in civilian clothing made in East and West Germany and carried appropriate non-American documentation and identification. Within Special Forces, they were referred to as &quot;Stay Behind&quot; Teams, the detachments that would stay behind if the Soviet Union ever attacked the West. Their mission was the traditional SF mission, that of Unconventional Warfare (UW), to aid those who were subjugated by an occupying force, and assist those who would rebel against the Soviets (...to teach indigenous people basic warfare tactics and weapons use, and lead them in operations against the enemy, conducting guerrilla warfare). Many of its members later went on to help form Delta Force (Det A did not itself become Delta Force). Shachnow&#x27;s status grew as Special Forces grew, rising to the rank of Major General, receiving both a masters and an honorary doctoral degree along the way. He traveled the world, from Vietnam to the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Korea and back to Germany for the fall of the Berlin Wall.

===Education===
Shachnow attended the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston. While in the Army, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of Nebraska, a Master of Science in public administration from Shippensburg State College in Pennsylvania. He also graduated from the Executive Management Program at Harvard University.

===Retirement===

Shachnow retired from the Army in 1994, at the age of 60, after 40 years of active-duty service.

Sidney Shachnow has been an honorary member of Rotary Club Berlin-Luftbruecke (Berlin-Airlift) since March 13, 1990.

Shachnow was inducted as a Distinguished Member of the Special Forces Regiment in 2007. He was posthumously awarded the Bull Simons Award in 2019.

===Autobiography &quot;Hope and Honor&quot;===
In 2004, Shachnow authored &quot;Hope and Honor&quot;, an autobiographical account of his childhood experience in the Nazi Kovno concentration camp of Lithuania, his immigration and assimilation to the United States and his 40-year career in the U.S. Army, Special Forces.

===Politics===
On September 6, 2016 he endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, though he was publicly critical of some of Trump&#x27;s foreign policy proposals.

===Death===
Shachnow, who lived in Southern Pines, North Carolina, died on September 28, 2018. He was married to Arlene for 63 years and they had four daughters. Shachnow was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on February 12, 2019.

<doc id="1178983" wikidata="Q3419350" url="?curid=1178983" title="Nigerien hip-hop">
<text>Rap Nigerien is a hip hop music style that first appeared in Niamey, Niger, at the end of 1998.
==Rap Nigerien==
Rap Nigerien is a mélange of different languages spoken in Niger. Sampled music is often mellow, and is mixed with the traditional music, although more aggressive dance styles have been mixed in, reflecting influences of French, American, and other West African hip hop styles (especially Ivorian hip hop). Niger&#x27;s hip hop scene grew from humble beginnings to dominate much of Niger&#x27;s musical market. Young, dissatisfied Nigeriens have used the form to talk about things which anger them - forced marriages, child labor, corruption, poverty and other problems. Local recordings are mostly sold on cassette tapes and compact discs, as with most forms of contemporary West African popular music.

==Appearance==
Hip hop groups began to appear and perform in Niamey in 1998. The first known Nigerien hip hop album was Lakal Kaney&#x27;s 2000 &quot;La voix du Ténéré&quot;.

Rap Nigerien began to appear in UNICEF cultural center music programmes as bands performed in benefit shows and contests. In August 2004, UNICEF opened its &quot;Scene Ouverte Rap&quot;, where 45 new groups entered selections among an informal count of 300 existing groups. Shows took place at Niamey&#x27;s Jean Rouch Centre Culturel Franco – Nigerien (CCFN) in August 2004.

==Current==
The CCFN remains a major venue for Nigerien hip hop through 2008, hosting a regular competition series called the &quot;Clash Party&quot;.

Many of these first groups are still active, including Tchakey, Kaidan Gaskya, Almamy Koye &amp; WassWong, and Goro G. Diara Z, an Ivorian hip hop artist, was also living in Niamey at the time and was influential in the Niamey rap scene. Other successful groups include Black Daps, Berey Koy, Federal Terminus Clan, Haskey Klan, Kamikaz, Rass Idris, 3STM (Sols, Tataf et Mamoud), PCV (puissance, connaissance et verité) and Metafor.

<text>Hypertufa is an anthropic rock made from various aggregates bonded together using Portland cement.

Hypertufa is intended as a manufactured substitute for natural tufa, which is a slowly precipitated limestone rock; being very porous, it is favorable for plant growth.

Hypertufa is popular for making garden ornaments, pots and land forms. It is relatively light compared with terracotta or traditional concrete and can withstand harsh winters, at least down to .

Hypertufa was invented for use in alpine gardens. Alpine gardeners formerly used antique animal watering troughs, which became rare and expensive.

== Composition ==

Aggregates are generally &quot;Sphagnum&quot; (peat moss), sand, and perlite or vermiculite. Coconut coir is coming to take the place of sphagnum moss, as the latter is a very slowly renewing natural resource and the former is a ready byproduct of the coconut industry— it has all the advantages of the moss but without the environmental costs.

To increase structural strength and longevity, polymer fibers, liquid acrylic, and fiberglass may be incorporated into the mixture, along with various grades of sand, pebbles, and crushed rock which add to the final object&#x27;s overall strength and stone-like appearance though they increase its weight. Powdered concrete dyes (in small amounts) also tint the hypertufa to resemble natural rock.

== Example ==
An example of a hypertufa mortar mix (with classic proportions) is a 1:3 mix of cement-to-aggregate, given by a composition of:
*Three parts type I Portland cement
*Four parts sphagnum or coir
*Five parts perlite

Restated: Three parts cement to nine parts aggregate (by volume, not weight, very rough measure).

==Manufacture==
After water is added to the mixture, it is packed into a previously constructed mold, then sealed or covered in plastic and allowed to cure. The object may be carefully removed from its wrapping after 2–3 days for trimming and/or distressing, after which it is re-wrapped for another 3–5 days, at which time it is no longer considered &quot;green&quot; and can be handled &amp; worked without danger of breakage. It is then re-wrapped, moistened if necessary &amp; left to cure for a month. The longer the cure, the stronger the hypertufa. After the hypertufa object is completely cured, it is removed from the plastic, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to sit exposed to the elements for several more weeks to reduce its otherwise-toxic surface alkalinity. It can then be used to hold plants.

<doc id="1178994" wikidata="Q537148" url="?curid=1178994" title="Sonderaktion Krakau">
<text>Sonderaktion Krakau was a German operation against professors and academics of the Jagiellonian University and other universities in German-occupied Kraków, Poland, at the beginning of World War II. It was carried out as part of the much broader action plan, the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, to eradicate the Polish intellectual elite, especially in those centers (such as Kraków) that were intended by the Germans to become culturally German.

It is not clear if &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot; (special operation Kraków) was the actual German codename. The reason for the detention was communicated to professors in the concentration camp.

==Course of operation==

Soon after the establishment of the German occupation of Poland, following the invasion of Poland, on 19 October 1939, the Senate of the Jagiellonian University decided to open the university for a new academic year, which was to start on 13 November. This decision was communicated to German occupation authorities, who did not express objections. However, on 3 November, the Gestapo chief in Kraków &quot;&quot; Bruno Müller, commanded Jagiellonian University rector Professor Tadeusz Lehr-Spławiński to require all professors to attend his lecture about German plans for Polish education. The rector agreed and sent an invitation throughout the university for a meeting scheduled at the administrative center building in the Collegium Novum &quot;(entrance pictured)&quot;. On 6 November 1939, in lecture room no. 66 (currently no. 56) at noon, all academics and their guests gathered; among them, 105 professors and 33 lecturers from Jagiellonian University (UJ), four from University of Economics (AE) and four from Lublin and Wilno. There were also 34 professors and doctors from University of Technology (AG), who did not intend to start the academic year, and attended their own meeting in a different room.

The academics filled the hall but no &quot;Vortrag&quot; (lecture) on education was given. Instead, they were told by Müller that the university did not have permission to start a new academic year and that Poles were hostile toward German science and acted in bad faith. They were arrested on the spot by armed policemen, frisked, and escorted out. Some senior professors were kicked, slapped in the face (Stanisław Estreicher) and hit with rifle butts. An additional 13–15 university employees and students who were on site were also arrested, as well as the President of Kraków, Dr Stanisław Klimecki who was apprehended at home that afternoon.

All 184 persons were transported first to prison at Montelupich Street, then to barracks at Mazowiecka, and—three days later—to a detention center in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), where they spent 18 days split between two prison facilities: the detention center (&quot;Untersuchungsgefängnis&quot;, at the Świebodzka 1 Street), and the &quot;Strafgefängnis&quot; penal complex at Kleczkowska 35. The Gestapo were unprepared for such a large transfer of prisoners, and awaited permission to send them to Buchenwald concentration camp. However, that was filled to capacity and so, on 27 November 1939, at night, they were loaded onto a train to Sachsenhausen concentration camp located on the other side of Berlin, and in March 1940, sent further to Dachau concentration camp near Munich after a new batch of arrested younger academics arrived.

===Release===
Following loud international protest by prominent Italians including Benito Mussolini and the Vatican, 101 professors who were older than 40 were released from Sachsenhausen on 8 February 1940. Additional academics were released later. Some elderly professors did not survive the roll-calls, held three times a day even in ice and snow, and the grim living conditions where dysentery was common, warm clothes rare and food rations scarce. Twelve died in the camp within three months, and another five within weeks of release. Three professors of Jewish origin were separated and later were murdered or died of other causes: (Leon Sternbach, Wiktor Ormicki and ). Among the notable professors who died in the camp were Ignacy Chrzanowski (UJ; 19 January 1940), Stanisław Estreicher (UJ; 29 December 1939), Kazimierz Kostanecki (UJ; 11 January 1940), (AGH; 24 December 1939) and Michał Siedlecki (UJ; 11 January 1940, after roll-call). In March 1940, the able prisoners from Kraków who remained alive were sent to Dachau concentration camp and most released in January 1941 on intervention. The last one, Kazimierz Piwarski, was released in late 1941.

Many of those who went through &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot; and the internment formed an underground university in 1942 in defiance of the German punitive edicts. Among the 800 students of their underground college was Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II, taught by Prof. Tadeusz Lehr-Spławiński among others.

Today there is a plaque commemorating the events of &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot; in front of Collegium Novum in Kraków. Every 6 November, black flags are hung outside all Jagiellonian University buildings, and the Rector of the university lays wreaths to honor those who suffered.

<text>The color cerulean (American English) or caerulean (British English, Commonwealth English), is a variety of the hue of blue that may range from a light azure blue to a more intense sky blue, and may be mixed as well with the hue of green. The first recorded use of &quot;cerulean&quot; as a color name in English was in 1590. The word is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (), &quot;dark blue, blue, or blue-green&quot;, which in turn probably derives from &quot;caerulum&quot;, diminutive of &quot;caelum&quot;, &quot;heaven, sky&quot;.

&quot;Cerulean blue&quot; is the name of a blue-green pigment consisting of cobalt stannate (). The pigment was first synthesized in the late eighteenth century by Albrecht Höpfner, a Swiss chemist, and it was known as Höpfner blue during the first half of the nineteenth century. Art suppliers began referring to cobalt stannate as cerulean in the second half of the nineteenth century. It was not widely used by artists until the 1870s when it became available in oil paint.

==Pigment characteristics==
The primary chemical constituent of the pigment is cobalt(II) stannate (). The pigment is a greenish-blue color. In watercolor, it has a slight chalkiness. When used in oil paint, it loses this quality.

Today, cobalt chromate is sometimes marketed under the cerulean blue name but is darker and greener than the cobalt stannate version. The chromate makes excellent turquoise colors and is identified by &quot;Rex Art&quot; and some other manufacturers as &quot;cobalt turquoise&quot;.

Cerulean is inert with good light resistance, and it exhibits a high degree of stability in both watercolor and acrylic paint.

== History ==
Cobalt stannate pigment was first synthesized in 1789 by the Swiss chemist Albrecht Höpfner by heating roasted cobalt and tin oxides together. Subsequently, there was limited German production under the name of &quot;Cölinblau&quot;. It was generally known as Höpfner blue from the late eighteenth century until the middle of the nineteenth century.

In the late 1850s, art suppliers begin referring to the pigment as &quot;ceruleum&quot; blue. The London Times of 28 December 1859 had an advertisement for &quot;Caeruleum, a new permanent color prepared for the use of artists.&quot; Ure&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Arts&quot; from 1875 describes the pigment as &quot;Caeruleum . . . consisting of stannate of protoxide of cobalt, mixed with stannic acid and sulphate of lime.&quot; Cerulean was also referred to as coeurleum, cerulium, &quot;bleu céleste&quot; (celestial blue). Other nineteenth century English pigment names included &quot;ceruleum blue&quot; and &quot;corruleum blue&quot;. By 1935, Max Doerner referred to the pigment as cerulean, as do most modern sources, though ceruleum is still used.

Some sources claim that cerulean blue was first marketed in the United Kingdom by colourman George Rowney, as &quot;coeruleum&quot; in the early 1860s. However, the British firm of Roberson was buying &quot;Blue No. 58 (Cerulium)&quot; from a German firm of Frauenknecht and Stotz prior to Rowney. Cerulean blue was only available as a watercolor in the 1860s and was not widely adopted until the 1870s when it was used in oil paint. It was popular with artists including Claude Monet, Paul Signac, and Picasso. Van Gogh created his own approximation of cerulean blue using a mixture of cobalt blue, cadmium yellow, and white.

== Notable occurrences ==
In 1877, Monet had added the pigment to his palette, using it in a painting from his series &quot;La Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; (now in the National Gallery, London). The blues in the painting include cobalt and cerulean blue, with some areas of ultramarine. Laboratory analysis conducted by the National Gallery identified a relatively pure example of cerulean blue pigment in the shadows of the station&#x27;s canopy. Researchers at the National Gallery suggested that &quot;cerulean probably offered a pigment of sufficiently greenish tone to displace Prussian blue, which may not have been popular by this time.&quot;

Berthe Morisot painted the blue coat of the woman in her &quot;Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;, 1879 in cerulean blue in conjunction with artificial ultramarine and cobalt blue.

When the United Nations was formed at the end of World War II, they adopted cerulean blue for their emblem. The designer Oliver Lundquist stated that he chose the color because it was &quot;the opposite of red, the color of war.&quot;

In the Catholic Church, cerulean vestments are permitted on certain Marian feast days, primarily the Immaculate Conception in diocese currently or formerly under the Spanish Crown.

==Other color variations==

===Pale cerulean===
Pantone, in a press release, declared the pale hue of cerulean at right, which they call &quot;cerulean&quot;, as the &quot;color of the millennium&quot;.

The source of this color is the &quot;Pantone Textile Paper eXtended (TPX)&quot; color list, color #15-4020 TPX—Cerulean.
=== Cerulean (Crayola) ===
This bright tone of cerulean is the color called &quot;cerulean&quot; by Crayola crayons.
===Cerulean frost===
At right is displayed the color cerulean frost.

&quot;Cerulean frost&quot; is one of the colors in the special set of metallic colored Crayola crayons called Silver Swirls, the colors of which were formulated by Crayola in 1990.
===Curious Blue===
Curious Blue is one of the brighter-toned colors of cerulean.

<doc id="1179011" wikidata="Q540463" url="?curid=1179011" title="Ian Callaghan">
<text>Ian Robert Callaghan (born 10 April 1942) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He holds the record for most appearances for Liverpool. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1975 New Year Honours.

== Club career ==
=== Liverpool ===
Callaghan played 857 times for Liverpool between 1960 and 1978, breaking into the first team just after the appointment of Bill Shankly as Liverpool manager. He made his debut on 16 April 1960 at Anfield in a 4–0 victory over Bristol Rovers. He was a regular member of the first team by the time Liverpool won promotion to the First Division in 1962, and went on to help them win the league title in 1964, 1966, 1973, 1976 and 1977, as well as the 1965 and 1974 FA Cup finals, the UEFA Cup in 1973 and 1976, and the European Cup in 1977 (as a substitute) and in 1978. He was voted FWA Footballer of the Year in 1974. He was booked only once in his career, in the 1978 League Cup final replay at Old Trafford, which Liverpool lost to Nottingham Forest.

Callaghan played in the 1977 European Cup final, when Liverpool beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1, but in the 1978 season, which proved to be his last year at the club, his playing time was reduced as younger additions like Graeme Souness and Kenny Dalglish established themselves at the club. Callaghan was on the substitutes&#x27; bench when Liverpool retained the European Cup against Club Brugge in 1978.

=== Later career ===
Callaghan left Liverpool shortly after the 1978 European Cup final and signed for Swansea City, managed by former Liverpool striker John Toshack. He helped Swansea win a second successive promotion in 1979, which took them into the Second Division, and also had brief spells playing in the United States, Australia and Ireland towards the end of his career. He spent the final season of his career in the Fourth Division with Crewe Alexandra, making 15 appearances in the 1981–82 season and retiring as a player in his 40th year.

== International career ==
Of Irish descent, Callaghan played four times at senior level for England. Although he was in the squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, he did not play in the final so did not receive a medal. He did play in the group-stage match against France, Callaghan assisted Roger Hunt second goal in the 2-0 win on 20 July 1966, one of three wingers tried before manager Alf Ramsey decided to go with a team with no wingers. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners&#x27; squad members, Callaghan was presented with his medal by Prime Minister Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.

After that 1966 match against France, Callaghan&#x27;s next England appearance, his third, came against Switzerland on 7 September 1977, aged 35. This gap of 11 years 49 days between appearances is the longest such interval for any England player.

<text>Leighton Warren Smith Jr. (20 August 1939 – 28 November 2023) was a former United States Navy admiral. In 1994, he became the Commander in Chief of United States Naval Forces Europe and Allied Forces Southern Europe, holding the commands during the height of the Yugoslav wars. He commanded the NATO enacted no-fly zone (Operation Deny Flight) over Bosnia and the later bombing campaign against Republika Srpska (Operation Deliberate Force) in 1995. The same year he additionally took on command of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia with the objective of overseeing the peace agreement. He held all three positions until his retirement in 1996.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama, on August 20, 1939, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy with the Class of 1962. He received his wings in January 1964.

==Naval career==
As a naval aviator, Smith flew carrier-based A-4 Skyhawk and A-7 Corsair II light attack jet aircraft during multiple deployments to the Mediterranean, North Atlantic, Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. These included three cruises in waters off North Vietnam where he flew over 280 combat missions, primarily in the A-7 Corsair II. Smith held command at sea in the aviation community at squadron and wing levels as well as major commands that included a deep draft vessel, the , before taking command of the aircraft carrier and subsequent command of Carrier Group 6 in 1986 as a flag officer. He has logged over 4,200 flying hours and accumulated over 1000 carrier arrested landings.

===Commands===
Smith&#x27;s early flag officer tours were Director for Operations, United States European Command (1989–1991) and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations (1991–1994). Appointed to four-star rank in April 1994, he became Commander in Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe and concurrent NATO Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (1994–1996). In December 1995, he assumed, concurrently, command of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, a position he held until August 1996.

Smith&#x27;s IFOR command in Bosnia was criticized by Richard Holbrooke for his refusal to use his &quot;authority&quot; to also perform nonmilitary implementation tasks, including arresting indicted war criminals:



==Later work==
Smith retired from the US Navy on 1 October 1996. He served as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses, was President of Leighton Smith Associates and Vice President of Global Perspectives, Inc., both international consulting firms. He was Chairman of the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation, immediate past Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and served on the Executive Committee of the Association of Naval Aviation. 
He was also on the National Advisory Council to the Navy League and was a member of the Board of Directors of several corporations.

Smith was a supporter of the John McCain 2008 presidential campaign before the 2008 election. Smith spoke out in defense of McCain after critical comments from General Wesley Clark regarding McCain&#x27;s military experience. Prior to his retirement, Smith had previously served alongside General Clark for several years during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Smith has been one of the senior signatories of the March 31, 2009 letter urging the president to maintain the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces.

== Death ==
Smith died at his home in Pinehurst, N.C. on November 28, 2023.

<doc id="1179023" wikidata="Q420803" url="?curid=1179023" title="Jorge González (wrestler)">
<text>Jorge González (31 January 1966 – 22 September 2010) was an Argentine professional wrestler, basketball player and actor best known for his appearances in World Championship Wrestling under the ring name El Gigante and in the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name Giant Gonzalez. González remains the tallest man to have competed for both companies and the tallest Argentinian to have ever lived.

== Early life ==
Jorge González was born in El Colorado, Formosa, Argentina on 31 January 1966. González suffered from gigantism.

== Basketball career ==
González was billed as being , making him the tallest WWE wrestler and Argentine basketball player in history; his true height was , which still made him the tallest in wrestling and a tie for first place in basketball. He started his career with the youths of Hindú Club de Resistencia at the age of 16, standing tall. Subsequently, León Najnudel, then coach of the Argentine national team, recommended the board of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata to sign the player for the team&#x27;s Argentine second division roster. During 1986, González helped Gimnasia achieve promotion to the Argentine first division. He then signed for Sport Club Cañadense, but saw little action due to an injury that left him off the court for nine months.

=== National team ===
Coach León Najnudel included González in the Argentine national team who took part of the 1985 South American Basketball Championship (bronze medal) and the 1988 Tournament of the Americas (5th place), where he attracted the attention of the Atlanta Hawks&#x27; scouts.

=== NBA career ===
González took part in the 1988 NBA draft, being chosen by the Atlanta Hawks in the third round (#54 selection). Along with Hernán Montenegro (drafted #57), they became the first Argentine players drafted in the NBA. The Hawks bought the player&#x27;s rights from his Argentine team for a 30,000 Argentine australes fee. However, he was unable to adapt to the physical demands of NBA basketball, partly due to a serious knee injury.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Championship Wrestling (1988-1992) ===
In 1988, Hawks owner Ted Turner offered González a job as a professional wrestler in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which Turner also owned. After over a year of training, González was introduced to fans as El Gigante on 19 May 1990 at the pay-per-view Capital Combat. Wearing shorts, he competed as a fan favorite and was billed as being close to eight feet tall.

Over the next two years, he feuded with Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, participated in a Chamber of Horrors match in 1991 and also had a date on TBS with Missy Hyatt. He also participated in a feud with Sid Vicious who stood 6 ft 9 in and One Man Gang who stood at . The point of the feud was to determine who the real &quot;giant of WCW&quot; was. He also had a cross promotional stint in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion before signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1993.

According to Ron Reis, Gonzalez was set to make a return to the company at their 1995 pay-per-view Halloween Havoc in the role of &quot;The Yeti&quot;, an insurance policy put in place to make sure Hulk Hogan did not retain the WCW Championship against The Giant. The plan behind his return was to set up an idea Kevin Sullivan (who was the booker of the promotion at the time) had for the pay-per-view World War 3 1995 the following month. It would be a three ring, 60 man, over the top rope battle royal, with a giant occupying each of the three rings. But the idea fell through as González had a diabetes attack during preparation for his return at the Halloween Havoc pay-per-view leading him to having to be flown back to his native Argentina and Ron Reis had to take his spot in the role.
=== World Wrestling Federation (1993) ===
González competed as Giant Gonzalez during his time in the WWF. González grew a beard and wore a full body suit that featured airbrushed muscles with bushy hair attached. He was introduced at the Royal Rumble in January 1993, where he eliminated Harvey Wippleman&#x27;s nemesis The Undertaker from the Royal Rumble match despite not being an official participant. At WrestleMania IX, González lost to The Undertaker by disqualification after he knocked out the Undertaker using chloroform. After another loss to The Undertaker at SummerSlam, the feud came to an end, and after the match, Wippleman berated him, before González turned on Wippleman himself, turning face in the process. He lost to Randy Savage on WWF on TSN on 1 September.

The foundation was later set for a feud between González and Adam Bomb, but it never truly began. His last appearance in WWF was on 4 October episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in a 20-man battle royal match for the Intercontinental Championship. González was the first eliminated by &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, Diesel, Bastion Booger, 1-2-3 Kid, Marty Jannetty, Adam Bomb and Bam Bam Bigelow. Three days later, WWF announced that González left the company after his WWF contract had expired on 7 October 1993.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling and WAR (1994–1995) ===
After his departure from the WWF, González wrestled in the Japanese promotions NJPW and WAR (Wrestle and Romance) until his retirement from wrestling, and used his old ring name El Gigante. His last singles match was on 8 February 1995, when he lost to The Great Muta. On 8 December 1995, González wrestled his final match, teaming with Kōji Kitao in a loss to Shinja and Typhoon by countout.

== Acting career ==
González played the role of Manny, a carnival sideshow giant in a 1993 episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, who befriends Hobie, but later falls into the water and his large size makes it difficult to be rescued. González also had roles in the 1993 and 1994 &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; double-episode turned movies. In 1994 González made a short appearance as Eryx the Boxer in &quot;Hercules in the Underworld&quot;, a television prequel film from the television series &quot;&quot;.

== Retirement and personal life==

In January 1996, González retired from professional wrestling due to serious health issues and returned home to Argentina.

After his retirement from wrestling, González lived on a ranch in Argentina in his later years. His former manager Harvey Wippleman would send his own money to maintain González and his family. In October 2009, he began using a wheelchair, and also had to use a dialysis machine due to his failing kidneys. The Argentine Basketball Federation also helped Gonzalez with finances in his final years, including donations of appliances for his house, clothes and medicine. González was married and had one step-daughter.

==Death==
González died due to complications from diabetes type 1 and heart issues on 22 September 2010, in his hometown of San Martin, Argentina at the age of 44.

==Reception==
The Undertaker, who worked with González in WWF, was very vocal about him. Undertaker criticised González&#x27;s lack of wrestling ability. He also revealed that, during their match at WrestleMania 9, Undertaker shot on González after González was careless in the ring. He also mentioned his feud with him &quot;took years off my career&quot;.

<doc id="1179028" wikidata="Q245761" url="?curid=1179028" title="Grinding machine">
<text>A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is any of various power tools or machine tools used for grinding. It is a type of material removal using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. Each grain of abrasive on the wheel&#x27;s surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.

Grinding as a type of machining is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high accuracy of shape and dimension. As the accuracy in dimensions in grinding is of the order of 0.000025  mm, in most applications, it tends to be a finishing operation and removes comparatively little metal, about 0.25 to 0.50  mm depth. However, there are some roughing applications in which grinding removes high volumes of metal quite rapidly. Thus, grinding is a diverse field.

==Overview==

The grinding machine consists of a bed with a fixture to guide and hold the workpiece and a power-driven grinding wheel spinning at the required speed. The wheel’s diameter and the manufacturer’s rating determine the speed. The grinding head can travel across a fixed workpiece, or the workpiece can be moved while the grinding head stays in a fixed position.

Fine control of the grinding head or table position is possible using a vernier calibrated hand wheel or using the features of numerical controls.

Grinding machines remove material from the workpiece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. To cool the workpiece so that it does not overheat and go outside its tolerance, grinding machines incorporate a coolant. The coolant also benefits the machinist as the heat generated may cause burns. In high-precision grinding machines (most cylindrical and surface grinders), the final grinding stages are usually set up so that they remove about 200  nm (less than 1/10000  in) per pass - this generates so little heat that even with no coolant, the temperature rise is negligible.

==Types==
These machines include the:

* Belt grinder, which is usually used as a machining method to process metals and other materials, with the aid of coated abrasives. Analogous to a belt sander (which itself is often used for wood but sometimes metal). Belt grinding is a versatile process suitable for all kind of applications, including finishing, deburring, and stock removal.
* Bench grinder, which usually has two wheels of different grain sizes for roughing and finishing operations and is secured to a workbench or floor stand. Its uses include shaping tool bits or various tools that need to be made or repaired. Bench grinders are manually operated.
* Cylindrical grinder, which includes both the types that use centers and the centerless types. A cylindrical grinder may have multiple grinding wheels. The work piece is rotated and fed past the wheel(s) to form a cylinder. It is used to make precision rods, tubes, bearing races, bushings, and many other parts.
* Surface grinder, which has a head that is lowered to a work piece, which is moved back and forth under the grinding wheel on a table that typically has a controllable permanent magnet (magnetic chuck) for use with magnetic stock (especially ferrous stock) but can have a vacuum chuck or other fixture means. The most common surface grinders have a grinding wheel rotating on a horizontal axis, cutting around the circumference of the grinding wheel. Rotary surface grinders, commonly known as &quot;Blanchard&quot; style grinders, have a grinding head that rotates the grinding wheel on a vertical axis cutting on the end face of the grinding wheel, while a table rotates the work piece in the opposite direction underneath. This type of machine removes large amounts of material and grinds flat surfaces with noted spiral grind marks. It can also be used to make and sharpen metal stamping die sets, flat shear blades, fixture bases or any flat and parallel surfaces. Surface grinders can be manually operated or have CNC controls.
* Tool and cutter grinder, which usually can perform the minor function of the drill bit grinder or other specialist toolroom grinding operations.
* Jig grinder, which as the name implies, has a variety of uses when finishing jigs, dies, and fixtures. Its primary function is in the realm of grinding holes for drill bushings and grinding pins. It can also be used for complex surface grinding to finish work started on a mill.
* Gear grinder, which is usually employed as the final machining process when manufacturing a high-precision gear. The primary function of these machines is to remove the remaining few thousandths of an inch of material left by other manufacturing methods (such as gashing or hobbing).

* Centre grinder, which is usually employed as a machining process when manufacturing all kinds of high-precision shafts. The primary function of these machines is to grind the centers of a shaft very precisely. Accurate round center holes on both sides ensure a position with high repeat accuracy on the live centers.
* Die grinder, which is a high-speed hand-held rotary tool with a small diameter grinding bit. They are typically air-driven (using compressed air), but can be driven with a small electric motor directly or via a flexible shaft.
*Angle grinder, another handheld power tool, often used in fabrication and construction work.
* Internal grinder, which is used for grinding internal surfaces of workpieces, boron carbide wheels are effective when dealing with extremely hard materials that need high levels of precision.

<doc id="1179030" wikidata="Q3975725" url="?curid=1179030" title="1973 Rome airport attacks and hijacking">
<text>In December 1973, Fatah, a Palestinian military organization executed series of attacks originating at Rome-Fiumicino Airport in Italy which resulted in the deaths of 34 people. The attacks began with an airport-terminal invasion and hostage-taking, followed by the firebombing of a Pan Am aircraft and the hijacking of a Lufthansa flight.

Pan Am Flight 110 was scheduled to depart from Rome, Italy and arrive in Tehran, Iran, by way of Beirut, Lebanon. On 17 December 1973, shortly before takeoff, the airport terminal and the flight aircraft were attacked and the aircraft was set on fire by armed Palestinian gunmen, resulting in the deaths of thirty persons on the plane and two in the terminal.

Following the Flight 110 attack, the gunmen hijacked Lufthansa Flight 303 and killed two more people. They ended up in the custody of the Kuwaiti authorities.

== Background ==
Since the ousting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from Jordan, following the Jordanian-Palestinian civil war, Palestinian military organizations made South Lebanon their headquarters and base of operations, enlisting militants from Palestinian refugee camps. South Lebanon was referred to as &quot;Fatah-land&quot;, due to the almost complete control of Fatah and other military Palestinian organizations over this -officially Lebanese- area, which they used to stage attacks against Israel, mainly targeting civilians, and to engage in armed operations abroad, termed &quot;acts of terrorism.&quot;

== Terminal invasion and firebombing of Pan Am Flight 110 ==
On 17 December 1973, Pan Am Flight 110 was scheduled to fly from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome to Beirut International Airport in Lebanon and then on to Tehran, Iran. At the controls of the Boeing 707-321B (registration name &quot;Clipper Celestial&quot;) were Captain Andrew Erbeck, First Officer Robert Davison, and Flight engineer Kenneth Pfrang.

At approximately 12:51 local time in Rome, just as Flight 110 was preparing to taxi, five suspects made their way through the terminal building, armed with automatic firearms and grenades. The terrorists removed submachine guns from hand-luggage bags and began firing throughout the terminal, shattering windows and killing two people. Pilots and crew in the cockpit of the aircraft were able to observe travelers and airport employees in the building running for cover. Captain Erbeck announced over the plane&#x27;s public address system that there was &quot;some commotion&quot; in the terminal and instructed all the people on board to get down on the floor.

Several of the gunmen ran across the tarmac toward the Pan American jet, throwing one phosphorus incendiary and other hand grenades through the open front and rear doors of the aircraft. The explosions knocked crew and passengers to the ground, and the cabin filled with thick, acrid smoke from the resulting fires. Stewardesses were able to open the emergency exit over the wing on one side of the plane; the other exit was obstructed by gunmen. The crew attempted to evacuate as many passengers as possible through the available exit, but twenty-nine passengers and purser Diana Perez died on the plane, including all eleven passengers in first class. Four Moroccan officials heading to Iran for a visit, and Bonnie Erbeck, wife of the plane&#x27;s captain, were among the dead. Captain Erbeck survived the attack. Also killed were fourteen Aramco employees and employee family members. The aircraft itself was destroyed.

== Hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 303 ==
Having assaulted the Pan Am aircraft, the five gunmen took hostage several Italians and Lufthansa ground crew members into Lufthansa Flight 303, waiting to depart for Munich. An Italian border police officer, 20-year-old Antonio Zara, was shot and killed when he first arrived at the scene of the attack and tried to fight the terrorists, after the general alarm had been sounded by the airport&#x27;s control tower.

The hijackers then forced the crew already on board to move the plane towards the runway in order to take off. For the first part of the plane&#x27;s taxiing, the aircraft was chased by several Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza vehicles, who abandoned the chase after the hijackers threatened to kill all the hostages on board. At 13:32 hours, just over half an hour from the start of the action, the plane took off for Athens, Greece, where it arrived at 16:50 hours, local Athens time.

The attack was too fast to allow an adequate response from the airport&#x27;s police forces. At the time, 117 officers were on duty at the airport: 9 carabinieri, 46 customs officers and 62 State Police officers, of which 8 were employed in the anti-sabotage service, a negligible number for an intercontinental airport like Fiumicino. The airport structure was unsuitable for the prevention of terrorist attacks, as it was designed at a time when such events were rare.

===Athens stopover===
Upon landing in Athens, the terrorists demanded by radio the release of two Palestinian gunmen responsible for an attack on Hellinikon International Airport. They claimed to have killed five hostages, including the plane&#x27;s first officer. The terrorists then threatened to crash the jet in the middle of Athens if their demands were not met. In reality, only one Italian hostage, Domenico Ippoliti, had been killed and one other hostage wounded. After failing to persuade the Greek authorities on releasing the terrorists, they limited their demands to just refuel and leave. The plane took off again from Athens after sixteen hours on the ground and after the gunmen had released the wounded hostage and dumped the body of the dead hostage onto the tarmac.

===Damascus stopover===
The plane next headed for Beirut, Lebanon, where Lebanese authorities refused to allow its landing, and blocked the runway with vehicles. Cyprus also refused to allow landing. The terrorists on board ordered the plane to head for Damascus, Syria, allegedly because the plane was running low on fuel. After they landed in the Syrian capital&#x27;s airport, Air Force Commander Major General Naji Jamil attempted to persuade the Palestinians to release the hostages, but they refused. The Syrians provided food to everyone on board and refueled the plane. They also treated one of the hijackers for a head injury. The plane took off again two to three hours after landing.

===Landing in Kuwait===
The commandeered jet headed for Kuwait, where Kuwaiti authorities refused to allow it to land. Captain Kroese was ordered by the terrorists to land anyway on a secondary runway. An hour of negotiations between the terrorists and the Kuwaiti authorities ended with the release of all twelve remaining hostages in exchange for &quot;free passage&quot; to an unknown destination for the hijackers. The terrorists were permitted to retain their weapons and, upon leaving the plane, raised their hands to the cameras in a V-for-victory sign.

== Aftermath ==

The terrorists negotiated their escape, but they were still captured shortly thereafter. The Kuwaiti authorities, after questioning the terrorists, decided not to put them on trial and considered the possibility of handing them over.
The factors that came into play at this point were complex, and sparked a diplomatic case that saw the US and many Arab and European countries clashing over the fate of the terrorists and which nation had jurisdiction to prosecute them.

Italy, despite having made a formal request for extradition to the Arab emirate, appeared to have no real intention of detaining and trying the terrorists on its own territory, since the request was bound to failure (Italy had no extradition treaty with Kuwait). What probably encouraged Italy to relent in its efforts to take the matter under its command was the danger that detaining the suspects in Italian prisons could have exposed Italy to retaliation by other Palestinian terrorists in a bid for their release. Subsequently, in fact, the last terrorist who was held in Italy (responsible for the failed attack in Ostia in 1972) was also actually released, probably for the same reason. Other European countries such as the Netherlands also followed this line of thinking. 
Italy&#x27;s actions lend credence to the notion that the Italian government had decided to consider the tragic events at Fiumicino in terms of its &quot;national interest&quot;, whereby it engaged in compromise that tended towards humiliation.

After gruelling international wrangling, in 1974, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat agreed to the suspects being taken to Cairo under the responsibility of their group, who would process them for conducting an &quot;unauthorized operation&quot;. They remained in prison until 24 November 1974, when, following negotiations further to the hijack of a British aircraft in Tunisia (carried out with the precise aim of forcing their release), the five men in the commando were released in Tunisia with the complicity of a good number of Arab and European governments and the US. Thereafter, all news of the men ceased and they were spirited away, perhaps hosted in an Arab country where they went unpunished.

<text>Michael Hausman is an American musician and talent manager, known for his collaboration with former-girlfriend and bandmate Aimee Mann.

Hausman attended Berklee College of Music and played with a Boston band called The Dark before becoming the drummer for the new wave band &#x27;Til Tuesday in the mid-1980s; the group&#x27;s best-known hit, &quot;Voices Carry&quot; is said to have been inspired by an argument between Hausman and bandmate (and one-time girlfriend) Aimee Mann. The producer of the song, Mike Thorne, disputed this and stated that the lyrics originally had Mann singing to another woman, though the sex was changed owing to pressure from the record label.

Hausman later became a talent manager, representing Mann and other artists, including Michael Penn, Skeleton Key and Pete Droge. In addition to Mann, his current roster includes Suzanne Vega, Marc Cohn, Amanda Palmer, Kristina Train, The Both, and Christina Courtin. Hausman, along with Mann and Penn, founded the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created.

<text>Red Roses for Me is the debut studio album by the London-based band the Pogues, released on 15 October 1984. It was produced by Stan Brennan, who had managed the Nipple Erectors/The Nips and Rocks Off Records shop in London.

==Overview==
&quot;Red Roses for Me&quot; is filled with traditional Irish music performed with punk influences. &quot;The Mancunion&quot; saw the &quot;creativity of post-punk&quot; as being &quot;evident throughout the record&quot;, while Muso&#x27;s Guide described much of &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot; as &quot;a whirlwind of revved-up folk punk&quot;. The band&#x27;s approach of mixing traditional songs and ballads with frontman Shane MacGowan&#x27;s &quot;gutter hymns&quot; about drinking, fighting and sex was innovative at the time. The album reached number 89 in the UK album charts.

The front of the album shows the band with the exception of drummer Andrew Ranken (pictured in inset) sitting in front of a picture of US President John F. Kennedy. On the back cover, accordion player James Fearnley has a bottle sticking out of his coat, while bass player Cait O&#x27;Riordan is seen holding a can of beer. Shane MacGowan is pictured with his foot in a cast.

==Critical reception==
The UK music press hailed the Pogues&#x27; début album as a breath of fresh air, with positive reviews. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; felt that &quot;the quality of their music, even the very nature of it, is strangely irrelevant. What&#x27;s important is their existence at all. For The Pogues are a gesture – a particularly bloody two-fingered one – aimed at all things considered current and fashionable in 1984... Theirs is a gut reaction to traditional music – and with it comes all the motion, intensity and vigour that has largely been lost to these songs since the early days of the folk revival in the Sixties.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; stated, &quot;From the strummed banjo and lilting accordion that preface a roaring singalong &#x27;Transmetropolitan&#x27; to the final unidentified voice offering an unaccompanied &#x27;diddly I di di&#x27; refrain, there exists a wealth of evidence that Shane MacGowan&#x27;s faith in the power of positive drinking-music has paid premiums. The raucous surge and evocative noise that has filled the capital&#x27;s pubs and clubs has come through the stark sobriety of the studio set-up to arrive intact in all its sweat-soaked beer-stained glory... If you think they&#x27;ve rehabilitated a music that&#x27;s been asleep for a while you&#x27;re dead wrong – on both counts. The music has never been away, and The Pogues in all their irreverent &#x27;seriousness&#x27; have taken it out on a limb, where it all started, where it belongs.&quot; Awarding the album 3¾ stars out of five, &quot;Sounds&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Red Roses for Me&quot; is a satisfyingly impure, purposefully imperfect and totally irresistible collection of lasting resentment, rebellious roars, watery-eyed romance and uproarious jigs... Surprisingly, this record works. It manages to convey the sullied, brazen and raucous spirit of their live set very effectively.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and proclaimed &quot;tepid it ain&#x27;t&quot;.

===Legacy===
For the 1994 reissue of the album &quot;Q&quot; observed that the album &quot;rushes along at an unholy amphetamine gallop... they sound utterly intoxicated both with their own enthusiasm and the spirit of the jig and the reel&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming calls the album &quot;good and rowdy fun&quot;, but feels that &quot;on &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; and &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot;, the Pogues would prove that they were capable of a lot more than that&quot;.

<doc id="1179043" wikidata="Q827274" url="?curid=1179043" title="Angle grinder">
<text>An angle grinder, also known as a side grinder or disc grinder, is a handheld power tool used for grinding (abrasive cutting) and polishing. Although developed originally as tools for rigid abrasive discs, the availability of an interchangeable power source has encouraged their use with a wide variety of cutters and attachments.

Angle grinders can be powered by an electric motor or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle, on which can be mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either of which can be replaced when worn. Angle grinders typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain angle grinders, depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber, depending on the amount of flexibility desired.

Angle grinders are used in metal fabrication shops and on construction sites. They are also common in machine shops, along with die grinders and bench grinders.

==Safety and health==


The use of an angle grinder in cutting is not preferred, because large amounts of harmful sparks, fumes and particulates are generated when compared with using reciprocating saw or band saw. Angle grinders produce sparks when cutting ferrous metals. They also produce shards when cutting other materials. The blades themselves may break, which is a hazard to the face and eyes especially, as well as other parts of the body. Consequently, a full face shield and other protective clothing must be worn. Angle grinders should never be used without their guard or handle attached. All workpieces should be securely clamped or held firmly in a vise. In a sound pressure level and vibration study conducted by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, grinders under an unloaded condition created noise which ranged from 91 to 103 dBA.

===Regulation===

==Uses==
Angle grinders may be used for removing excess material from a piece. There are many different kinds of discs that are used for various tasks, such as cut-off discs (diamond blade), abrasive grinding discs, grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels and polishing pads. The angle grinder has large bearings to counter side forces generated during cutting, unlike a power drill, in which the force is axial.

Angle grinders are widely used in metalworking and construction, emergency rescues, and even for the theft of bicycles. Generally, they are found in workshops, service garages and auto body repair shops. There are a large variety of angle grinders with different disc sizes and power sources: battery, corded or pneumatic. Other variables include the power of the motor, rpm, and arbor size. Generally, disc size and power increase together. Disc size is usually measured in inches or millimeters. Common disc sizes for angle grinders in the United States include 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 inches, with the most popular sizes being the 4.5 and 5&quot; size. In Europe, the most common sizes for angle grinder discs are 115 and 125 millimeters.

Discs for pneumatic grinders are much smaller. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter-duty jobs in which more precision is required. That is because pneumatic grinders can be powerful while being small and light, because they do not contain heavy copper motor windings. It is harder for an electric grinder to maintain adequate power with smaller size. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy duty jobs. However, there are also small electric grinders and large pneumatic grinders.

Angle grinders have been used to remove wheel clamps from vehicles.

==History==
The high-speed angle grinder was invented in 1954 by German company &quot;Ackermann + Schmitt (FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge GmbH)&quot; in Steinheim an der Murr. As a result, in German, Dutch, Slovak, Czech, Polish, Croatian, Romanian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Latvian, an angle grinder is colloquially called a &quot;flex&quot;, and in Italy and in Spanish-speaking countries it is sometimes called &quot;flexible&quot;. In Switzerland it is known as &quot;Perles&quot; from a popular brand of cutting tools. In Polish it is also known as &quot;kątówka&quot; or &quot;gumówka&quot; (= the rubber thing), which refers to the elasticity of certain types of disks. However they are never made out of true rubber due to fire hazard. In Russian, it is known as &quot;болгарка&quot; (&quot;bolgarka&quot;) (literally &quot;Bulgarian&quot; of the feminine gender), since the first angle grinders in the USSR were Bulgarian made.

<doc id="1179049" wikidata="Q623009" url="?curid=1179049" title="National Woman's Party">
<text>The National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP) was an American women&#x27;s political organization formed in 1916 to fight for women&#x27;s suffrage. After achieving this goal with the 1920 adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the NWP advocated for other issues including the Equal Rights Amendment. The most prominent leader of the National Woman&#x27;s Party was Alice Paul, and its most notable event was the 1917–1919 Silent Sentinels vigil outside the gates of the White House.

On January 1, 2021, NWP ceased operations as an independent non-profit organization and assigned its trademark rights and other uses of the party&#x27;s name to the educational non-profit, Alice Paul Institute. The Alice Paul Institute has invited three members of NWP Board of Directors to join their board and in the near future will create a new committee to &quot;advise on a potential expansion of programs to the Washington, DC area and nationally&quot;. The papers and artifacts of the NWP, were donated to the Library of Congress and the National Park Service to make them available to the public.

==Overview==
The National Woman&#x27;s Party was an outgrowth of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, which had been formed in 1913 by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns to fight for women&#x27;s suffrage. The National Woman&#x27;s Party broke from the much larger National American Woman Suffrage Association, which had focused on attempting to gain women&#x27;s suffrage at the state level. The NWP prioritized the passage of a constitutional amendment ensuring women&#x27;s suffrage throughout the United States.

==Early history==
Alice Paul was closely linked to England&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Suffrage Political Union (WSPU), organized by Emmeline Pankhurst. While a college student in England, Paul became involved with the Pankhursts and their English suffrage campaign. During this time Alice Paul met Lucy Burns, who would go on and be a co-founder of the NWP. Although Paul was closely tied to the militant suffrage campaign in England, when she left to pursue suffrage in the United States, instead Paul pioneered civil disobedience in the United States. For example, members of the WSPU heckled members of parliament, spit on police officers, and committed arson.

While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul continued her struggle for women&#x27;s equality and organized picketing of a wartime president to maintain attention to the lack of enfranchisement for women.  Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States to fight a war for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. Similar arguments were being made in Europe, where most of the allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or soon would.

After their experience with militant suffrage work in Great Britain, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns reunited in the United States in 1910. The two women originally were appointed to the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In March 1913, the two women organized the first national suffrage parade of 5,000–8,000 women (by differing estimates) in Washington, D.C., on the day before Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s inauguration. This was designed as a political tactic to show the strength of women and to show that they would pursue their goals under Wilson&#x27;s administration. Leading the parade was Inez Milholland who wore all white and rode on a white horse, which later served as a symbol for the suffrage movement. This placement of Millholland at the start of the parade was strategic because of Mulholland&#x27;s beauty, Paul knew she would attract media attention and followers. One of the criticisms of this first national suffrage parade was the barrier of women of color from participating side by side with white women. Even though Paul never opposed black women getting the right to vote, she barred them from marching with the white women and forced them to be in the back of the parade with the men to appease southern women. The parade quickly devolved into chaos due to violent reactions from the crowd and a lack of support by the local police. The D.C. police did little to help the suffragists; but the women were assisted by the Massachusetts National Guard, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and boys from the Maryland Agricultural College, who created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd.

After this incident, which Paul effectively used to rally public opinion to the suffrage cause, Paul and Burns founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in April 1913, which split off from NAWSA later that year. There were many reasons for the split, but primarily Paul and Burns were frustrated with the National&#x27;s slower approach of focusing on individual state referendums and wanted to pursue a congressional amendment. Alice Paul had also chafed under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt, as she had very different ideas of how to go about suffrage work, and a different attitude towards militancy. Catt disapproved of the radical strategies, inspired by the British &quot;Suffragettes&quot;, Paul and Burns were trying to implement into the American Suffrage Movement.

The split was confirmed by a major difference of opinion on the Shafroth–Palmer Amendment. This amendment was spearheaded by Alice Paul&#x27;s replacement as chair of the National&#x27;s Congressional Committee, and was a compromise of sorts meant to appease racist sentiment in the South. Shafroth–Palmer was to be a constitutional amendment that would require any state with more than 8 percent signing an initiative petition to hold a state referendum on suffrage. This would have kept the law-making out of federal hands, a proposition more attractive to the South. Southern states feared a congressional women&#x27;s suffrage amendment as a possible federal encroachment into their restrictive system of voting laws, meant to disenfranchise the black voter.

Paul and Burns felt that this amendment was a lethal distraction from the true and ultimately necessary goal of an all-encompassing federal amendment protecting the rights of all women—especially as the bruising rounds of state referendums were perceived at the time as almost damaging the cause. In Paul&#x27;s words: &quot;It is a little difficult to treat with seriousness an equivocating, evasive, childish substitute for the simple and dignified suffrage amendment now before Congress.&quot;

==Opposition to Wilson==
Women associated with the party staged a very innovative suffrage parade on March 3, 1913, the day before Wilson&#x27;s inauguration.

During the group&#x27;s first meeting, Paul clarified that the party would not be a traditional political party and therefore would not endorse a candidate for president during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. As a result, in 1918, Paul ran a campaign that boycotted Democrats because of their refusal to support women&#x27;s suffrage. They decided to boycott the entire party, including pro-suffrage Democrats. Eventually, the boycott of Democrats spearheaded by the NWP lead to a Republican majority in the house. The National Woman&#x27;s Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival NAWSA, under Carrie Chapman Catt gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president.

==Picketing the White House==
The escalating conflict in Europe didn&#x27;t stop Alice Paul and the NWP from protesting Wilson&#x27;s hypocritical stance on the war. Wilson promoted the idea of maintaining democracy abroad, even though the United States still denied half of its citizens the right to vote. The NWP pickets were seen as controversial because they continued during war time and other suffrage groups like NAWSA chose to support the war effort. Known as &quot;Silent Sentinels&quot;, their action lasted from January 10, 1917 until June 1919. The picketers were tolerated at first, but when they continued to picket after the United States declared war in 1917, they were arrested by police for obstructing traffic. Regardless of the weather, the women stood outside of the White House holding banners, constantly reminding Wilson of his hypocrisy. When they were first arrested, Lucy Burns claimed that they were political prisoners but were treated as regular prisoners.  As a tribute to their commitment to suffrage, they refused to pay the fines  and accepted prison time.

The first night that the Silent Sentinels spent in jail was known as the Night of Terror: the prisoners were beaten until a few of them were unconscious, starved, and Burns had her hands chained above her head. Due to this unlawful detention, many of the NWP&#x27;s members went on hunger strikes; some, including Lucy Burns and Paul, were force-fed by jail personnel as a consequence. Hunger strikes left the women weak and in terrible conditions, but they persisted. After a while, the guards were told to force-feed the women. They had long narrow tubes shoved down their throats, which caused many injuries that failed to heal. The suffragists were also forced to provide labor in the workhouses and were often beaten and abused. Taking advantage of the mistreatment and physical abuse, some of the suffragists shared their stories to the press and to &quot;The Suffragist&quot;, their suffrage newspaper. Doris Stevens, a notable member of the NWP, wrote about their horrible experiences in the Occoquan Workhouse in her memoir &quot;Jailed for Freedom&quot;. The resulting publicity was at a time when Wilson was trying to build a reputation for himself and the nation as an international leader in human rights. Many of banners featured quotes from Wilson about preserving democracy abroad, which called attention to Wilson&#x27;s hypocrisy and his lack of support for a national suffrage amendment.

There are many different theories about why Wilson changed his stance of suffrage. Wilson favored  woman suffrage at the state level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided, with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state&#x27;s rights. The only Southern state to grant women the vote was Arkansas. The NWP in 1917–1919 repeatedly targeted Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment. Wilson, however, kept in close touch with more moderate suffragists of the NAWSA. Wilson continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was in support; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him. In January 1918, Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill. The NWP had many innovative non-violent tactics including staging sit-ins, organizing deputations of high class and working-class women, boycotting the Democrats in midterm elections, using the voting power of women in the west, appealing to Wilson everyday through picketing, and calling out Wilson for supporting world democracy but not supporting it at home. These tactics were a contributing factor in getting Wilson to change his position on the suffrage bill. It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification. Scholar Belinda A. Stillion Southard has written that &quot;...the campaign of the NWP was crucial toward securing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.&quot;

==Fighting for equal rights==

The NWP played a critical role in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, which granted U.S. women the right to vote. Alice Paul then turned her attention to securing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) which she felt was vital for women to secure gender equality. The NWP regrouped in 1923 and published the magazine &quot;Equal Rights&quot;. The publication was directed towards women but also intended to educate men about the benefits of women&#x27;s suffrage, women&#x27;s rights and other issues concerning American women.

Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. 

The NWP did not support protective legislation and argued that these laws would continue to depress women&#x27;s wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society. But, the NWP did support working women and their support was vital throughout their campaign for the national Amendment. Alice Paul organized many working class deputations and even sent over 400 blue collar workers to meet with Wilson. Although seen as highly controversial due to the status difference, this move showed Paul&#x27;s support for all types of women, not just those of prestigious class.

After 1920, the National Woman&#x27;s Party authored over 600 pieces of legislation fighting for women&#x27;s equality; over 300 were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and under president Sarah Tarleton Colvin, who served in 1933, pressed for equal pay. Scholar Mary K. Trigg has noted, &quot;...the NWP played a central role in the women&#x27;s rights movement after 1945. It stuck to its laser-like focus on the ERA, doggedly lobbying year in and year out for the amendment&#x27;s introduction in Congress.&quot; In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization. Instead, it turned its focus to education and to preserving its collection of first hand source documents from the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. The NWP continues to function as an educational organization, maintaining and interpreting the collection left by the work of the historic National Woman&#x27;s Party.

Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed.

==Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964==
In 1963 Congress passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex.

The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. He was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, but voted in support of such laws for white women. 
Smith&#x27;s amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. 
Historians debate Smith&#x27;s motivation—was it a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, or did he support women&#x27;s rights and was attempting to improve the bill by broadening it to include women? Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party&#x27;s platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions.

Smith asserted that he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths, he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment. For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment—with no linkage to racial issues—in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman&#x27;s Party and especially Paul. She and other activists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws &quot;protecting&quot; women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs. The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Pauli Murray was also instrumental in the inclusion of sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits the discrimination based on sex, which has been attributed to the betterment of women as a group.

==Publications==
&quot;The Suffragist&quot; newspaper was founded by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in 1913. It was referred to as &quot;the only women&#x27;s political newspaper in the United States&quot; and was published to promote women&#x27;s suffrage activities. The Suffragist would follow weekly events and promote different views held by the leaders of the NWP. Its articles had political cartoons, by Nina E. Allender to garner support for the movement and communicate the status of the suffrage amendment.

After the amendment for the women&#x27;s right to vote was passed, the publication was discontinued by the National Woman&#x27;s Party and succeeded in 1923 by &quot;Equal Rights&quot;. Published until 1954, &quot;Equal Rights&quot; began as a weekly newsletter and evolved into a bi-monthly release aimed at keeping NWP members informed about developments related to the ERA and legislative issues. It included field reports, legislation updates and features about the activities of the NWP and featured writing from contributors including Crystal Eastman, Zona Gale, Ruth Hale and Inez Haynes Irwin. Josephine Casey appeared on the cover of the publication in April 1931 as a result of her recurring column about the labour conditions of female textile workers in Georgia.

==Legacy==

The Nineteenth amendment, which prohibits the denial of the right to vote on the basis of sex, became the law of the land when it was ratified by a sufficient number of states in 1920. Many African American women and men in the Jim Crow South, however, remained disenfranchised after the ratification of this amendment until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Today, the National Woman&#x27;s Party exists as a 501c3 educational organization. Its task is now the maintenance and interpretation of the collection and archives of the historic National Woman&#x27;s Party. The NWP operates out of the Belmont–Paul Women&#x27;s Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, where objects from the collection are exhibited. The legacy that this group left behind is mixed. While Alice Paul and the NWP were instrumental in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, the Party failed to include Black women and refused to help Black women gain the right to vote. To keep the support of southern members of the NWP, Paul refused to bring up the issue of race in the south. Her single-minded focus on the ERA caused her to refuse to fight the Jim Crow Laws barring black women the right to vote. Historian Nancy Cott has noted that as the party moved into the 1920s it remained ideologically consistent in the pursuit of a solitary goal for women and
it remained an autocratically run, a single-minded and single-issue pressure group, still reliant on getting into the newspapers as a means of publicizing its cause, very insistent on the method of &quot;getting in touch with the key men.&quot; NWP lobbyists went straight to legislators, governors, and presidents, not to their constituents.

In 1972 Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed.

<text>Liu Yizheng (; 1880–1956) was a Chinese historian, calligrapher, librarian, cultural scholar, educator, and academic leader. He is known for his personal charisma, spirit and eruditeness. In modern Chinese academic field, it is said that the number of famous experts in various fields including in literature, history, geography, philosophy and even natural science he educated and enlighted was the most. Liu Yizheng and Wang Bohang were honorifically called Nanyong Double Pillars (Two pillars of Nanjing University) during the early period of the Republic of China.

== Biography ==
=== Early life under the Qing dynasty ===
Born and educated under the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), Liu passed the first level of the imperial civil service examination a few years before its abolition in 1905. In the early 1900s his mentor the philologist Miao Quansun (繆荃蓀; 1844–1919) put him in charge of writing a textbook on Chinese national history that had been commissioned by the reformist high official Zhang Zhidong (1837–1909). Liu&#x27;s &quot;Brief Account of the Past&quot; (&quot;Lidai shilue&quot; 歷代史略), an adaptation of Japanese historian Naka Michiyo&#x27;s (那珂通世; 1851–1908) &quot;General History of China&quot; (&quot;Shina tsūshi&quot; 支那通史), was published in Nanjing by a government press in 1902. After a two-month visit to Meiji Japan in 1902 during which he was impressed by the new Japanese education system, Liu used his new textbook to teach history in schools that had been created as part of the late Qing &quot;New Policies&quot; (&quot;Xinzheng&quot; 新政, 1901–1911). In 1905 the new Ministry of Education (&quot;Xuebu&quot; 學部) officially designated Liu&#x27;s &quot;Brief Account&quot; as a national textbook.

=== Republican times ===
After the Qing fell and was replaced by a Republican government, Liu opposed Hu Shih&#x27;s call for a &quot;literary revolution&quot; that consisted in replacing classical Chinese with more vernacular forms of writing, a kind of reform advocated by the intellectuals of the New Culture Movement. Refusing to ascribe China&#x27;s recent difficulties to Confucianism or traditional Chinese culture, Liu attributed them to the Manchurian domination, the Opium War, corrupt government, warlords, and all kinds of social problems which, he argued, is not the consequence of practice but the absence of practice of Confucianism.

In the 1920s Liu wrote several historical articles for the &quot;Critical Review&quot; (&quot;Hsuehheng&quot; 學衡), a journal that was founded in 1922 at National Southeastern University (later renamed National Central University and Nanjing University). In some of these articles he defended the value of traditional historical scholarship, disagreeing with Gu Jiegang and other advocates of the Doubting Antiquity School, who doubted the reliability of ancient Chinese historical records. Liu&#x27;s &quot;History of Chinese Culture&quot; (&quot;Zhongguo wenhua shi&quot; 中國文化史), a cultural history of China from times immemorial to the 1920s, was first serialized in the &quot;Critical Review&quot; from 1925 to 1929 before being published as a book in 1932. Though Liu&#x27;s scholarship is usually viewed as conservative, his book laid the foundation for a discussion of China as a cultural entity rather than a racial one as was common at the time.

In 1927, Liu Yizheng served as the curator of National Study Library (Chinese Study Library) which later merged with National Central Library and formed the new Nanjing Library. In the library he founded Live and Read System, providing long-term devoted readers with vacant rooms to live in. Many such readers later called the library their alma mater.

== Works ==
Liu Yizheng wrote several books on Chinese history, including on the history of education, commerce, and culture. His books also include Business Ethics, An Introduction to Edition, etc. &quot;History of Chinese Culture&quot; () and &quot;Essentials of National History&quot; () are his most important works.

<doc id="1179051" wikidata="Q2564323" url="?curid=1179051" title="Bench grinder">
<text>A bench grinder is a benchtop type of grinding machine used to drive abrasive wheels. A pedestal grinder is a similar or larger version of grinder that is mounted on a , which may be bolted to the floor or may sit on rubber feet. These types of grinders are commonly used to hand grind various cutting tools and perform other rough grinding.

Depending on the bond and grade of the grinding wheel, it may be used for sharpening cutting tools such as tool bits, drill bits, chisels, and gouges. Alternatively, it may be used to roughly shape metal prior to welding or fitting.

A wire brush wheel or buffing wheels can be interchanged with the grinding wheels in order to clean or polish workpieces. Stiff buffing wheels can also be used when deburring is the task at hand. Some buffing machines (buffers) are built on the same concept as bench grinders except for longer housings and arbors with buffing wheels instead of grinding wheels. 

Bench grinders are standard equipment in metal fabrication shops and machine shops, as are handheld grinders (such as angle grinders and die grinders).

==Operation &amp; Safety==
===Wheel speed===
Wheels come with maximum RPM ratings printed on the label (paper blotter). The grinder&#x27;s RPM must be equal or lower; &quot;the maximum operating speeds indicated on the wheel&#x27;s tag must never be exceeded&quot;. Greatly overspeeding a grinding wheel makes it explode, which can injure or kill the operator. 

===Workpiece material suited to wheel grade===
The typical wheels on most bench grinders are vitreous-bond wheels. They work best to do their intended task, but they inherently have a risk of cracking. Grinding wheels designed for steel are not to be used for grinding softer metals, like aluminum. The soft metal gets lodged in the pores of the wheel and later expands with the heat of grinding. This can dislodge pieces of the grinding wheel, causing injury.

===Sides of wheel versus periphery===
Grinding is prohibited on the side of a typical (disk-shaped) bench grinder wheel, which is designed for grinding on the periphery only. Grinding on the side of a wheel can cause the wheel to explode. Some tool and cutter grinders have cup-shaped wheels designed to do grinding on the side.

===Tool rest and spark arrester placement===
The tool rest needs to be tight and within 2 to 3 mm of the wheel (&quot; to &quot;). This prevents the workpiece from slipping down between the wheel and the tool rest. The spark arrestors catch stray sparks.

Grinding is usually done with the workpiece resting on the tool rest. This prevents sudden slips in which the wheel grabs the work momentarily and yanks it out of the operator&#x27;s hand or pulls the hand toward the wheel.

===Wheel guards===
The wheel guards serve to intercept the fragments of an exploding wheel, keeping them from killing people or damaging surroundings. This is why running a grinder without the guards is prohibited.

===Coolant===
Grinding metal on a power-driven grinding wheel quickly heats up the workpiece. Most bench grinders are of the dry type, in which no cutting fluid (coolant) is used at the grinding interface, but often the workpiece is recurrently dunked into a pan or pot of water for cooling so as to keep it from getting hot enough to lose its temper, burn the operator&#x27;s hand, or both. Such pots are often mounted just below the grinder for safe and easy reach. For medium-carbon or high-carbon workpieces that are already hardened and tempered (such as tool bits and drill bits), the dipping of the piece into the water must be frequent enough to avoid very high heat followed by substantial quenching, which can easily destroy the existing heat treatment.

Some grinders for knife sharpening duty are of the wet type, in which the bottom of the wheel runs within a pan of water or other coolant. A tube may also deliver a stream of coolant near the top of the wheel. These grinders are not always called bench grinders, but they are among the class of benchtop grinding machines.

==Wheel dressing==
Bench grinder wheels sometimes need to be restored to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) after it has been in use for a while, is &quot;quite uncertain&quot;. It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and tool rest varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes need to be dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of wheel dresser. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a bench grinder and then using it for many years without thinking about wheel dressing, the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the wheel guards and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.

It is also possible to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to tire balancing with wheel weights. Most bench grinders never have these operations performed, because wheel dressing alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for bench grinders and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as surface grinders and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes&#x27; lack of weight balances out a heavy spot elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange.

==Wheel replacement==
Wheels sometimes need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, and then the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed on the left side of the grinder from the operator&#x27;s viewpoint, with wheel rotation &quot;toward&quot; the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. &quot;In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation.&quot; Holding the wheel against the wrench&#x27;s turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel&#x27;s inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves &quot;gently&quot; tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell&#x27;s ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;hoarse&quot; sound (failing to &quot;sing&quot;) indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, and then the grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.

<text>Dome A or Dome Argus is the highest ice dome on the Antarctic Plateau, located inland. It is thought to be the coldest naturally occurring place on Earth, with temperatures believed to reach . It is the highest ice feature in Antarctica, consisting of an ice dome or eminence above sea level. It is located near the center of East Antarctica, approximately midway between the enormous head of Lambert Glacier and the geographic South Pole, within the Australian claim.

==Description==
Dome Argus is located on the massive East Antarctic Ice Sheet and is the highest ice feature of Antarctica. Dome A is a lofty ice prominence, the highest rooftop of the Antarctic Plateau, and the elevation visually is not noticeable. Below this enormous dome, underneath at least of ice sheet, lies the Gamburtsev Mountain Range, about the size of the European Alps.

The name &quot;Dome Argus&quot; was given by the Scott Polar Research Institute from Greek mythology. Argus built the ship &quot;Argo&quot;, in which Jason and the Argonauts traveled to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece.

This site is one of the driest locations on Earth and receives of snow per year. Due to this, as well as calm weather, this site is an excellent location to obtain ice core samples for the research of past climates. Temperatures at Dome A fall below almost every winter.

==Exploration==
Details of the morphology of this feature were determined by the SPRI-NSF-TUD airborne radio echo sounding program between the years 1967 and 1979.

In January 2005 a team from the Chinese National Antarctic Research Expeditions (CHINARE) traversed from Zhongshan Station to Dome A and located the highest point of the ice sheet ( above sea level) by GPS survey at on January 18. This point is near one end of an elongate ridge (about long and wide), which is a major ice divide and has an elevation difference along its length of only a few meters. An automatic weather station (AWS) was deployed at Dome A, and a second station was installed approximately halfway between the summit and the coast at a site called Eagle (, 2830 m above sea level). These AWS are operated as part of an ongoing collaboration between China and Australia and include a third AWS (LGB69) at , above sea level, which has operated since January 2002. The station at Dome A is powered by solar cells and diesel fuel and requires yearly service and refuelling.

==Extreme temperatures==
The coldest air temperature recorded by thermometer at Dome A since January 2005 was in July 2005. This may have been beaten by an unconfirmed reading of in June 2019. The lowest surface temperature ever measured on the surface of the Earth () was recorded by satellite on August 10, 2010, between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji. Analysis of satellite data and atmospheric models shows that Ridge A, which is located southeast of Dome A, is potentially an even better location to look for the lowest temperatures on Earth.

==Observatory==
The Polar Research Institute of China deployed a robotic observatory called PLATO (PLATeau Observatory) on the dome in January 2008. PLATO was designed and built by the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia to provide a platform from which astronomical observations and site-testing could be conducted. Various institutions from Australia, US, China and the UK provided instruments that were deployed with PLATO, these instruments included CSTAR, Gattini, PreHEAT, Snodar, Nigel and the PLATO web cameras.

The Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, Chinese Academy of Sciences established a wireless network technology based observation system called Dome A-WSN on the dome in January 2008.

The Kunlun Station, China&#x27;s third station in Antarctica, was set up at the dome on January 27, 2009. Thus far the Antarctic Kunlun Station is suitable as a summer station, but there are plans to develop it further and build an airfield nearby to ease servicing, as it is not reachable by helicopters.

<doc id="1179063" wikidata="Q4209964" url="?curid=1179063" title="Fagan inspection">
<text>A Fagan inspection is a process of trying to find in documents (such as source code or formal specifications) during various phases of the software development process. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited with the invention of formal software inspections.

Fagan inspection defines a process as a certain activity with pre-specified entry and exit criteria. In every process for which entry and exit criteria are specified, Fagan inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.

== Examples ==
Examples of activities for which Fagan inspection can be used are:
* Requirement specification
* Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA)
* Programming (for example for iterations in XP or DSDM)
* Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

== Usage ==
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan inspection. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10 to 100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase, it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit criteria, of that operation.

=== Criteria ===
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.

Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.

The exit criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to which the operation result (low-level document) is compared during the inspection. Any failure of the low-level document to satisfy the high-level requirements specified in the high-level document are called &quot;defects&quot; (and can be further categorized as &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; defects). Minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but may be small errors such as spelling mistakes or unaesthetic positioning of controls in a graphical user interface.

=== Typical operations ===
A typical Fagan inspection consists of the following operations:
* Planning
** Preparation of materials
** Arranging of participants
** Arranging of meeting place
* Overview
** Group education of participants on the materials under review
** Assignment of roles
* Preparation
** The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
** The participants prepare their roles
* Inspection meeting
** Actual finding of defect
* Rework 
** Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.
* Follow-up 
** In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. They should verify that all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects be corrected, as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project can be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.

=== Follow-up ===
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator). In this phase all the participants agree that the defects are addressed adequately.

If verification fails, go back to the rework process.

== Roles ==
The inspection process is normally performed by members of the same team that is implementing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:
* Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
* Reader: paraphrases the low-level document
* Reviewers: reviews the low-level document from a testing standpoint
* Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

== Benefits and results ==
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight into the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used.

Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major &quot;cost improvements&quot; can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.

In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations such as IBM, indicating that 80% to 90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached.

== Improvements ==
Although the Fagan inspection method has been proved to be very effective, improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. M. Genuchten for example has been researching the usage of an Electronic Meeting System (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results 

Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors. This again should result in improved productivity.

With a combined total of three EVA&#x27;s performed, he spent some 13 hours walking in space which is currently the record by a Chinese astronaut.

== Astronaut Corps career ==
Liu, along with Zhai Zhigang and Jing Haipeng, was chosen to be the main crew of Shenzhou 7, with Zhai as commander, on 17 September 2008. On 25 September, at 21:10 CST, they launched into space as China&#x27;s third human spaceflight mission, and the first Chinese mission ever to have a three-man crew. Liu and Zhai participated in China&#x27;s first-ever space walk.

Liu wore a Russian Orlan-M spacesuit, while Zhai wore the Chinese-made Feitian space suit. Liu remained in the open portal of the orbital module, assisting Zhai on his spacewalk; later in the space walk, Liu also performed a stand-up extra-vehicular activity, partially leaving the orbital module in order to hand Zhai a Chinese flag. After the spacewalk, Liu said in an interview that his inspiration and idols have always been Neil Armstrong and Yuri Gagarin.

In 2018, he became a PhD candidate at Beijing Institute of Technology.

On 17 June 2021, Liu flew on Shenzhou 12 as his second spaceflight, becoming one of the three initial crew members to enter the Tiangong space station. On 4 July 2021, Liu and Tang Hongbo, another crew member of Shenzhou 12, completed the first extravehicular activity of the Tiangong space station. On 20 August 2021, Liu and mission commander Nie Haisheng carried out the second extravehicular activity of the space station, making him the first Chinese national to perform extravehicular activities multiple times.

<doc id="1179072" wikidata="Q5322713" url="?curid=1179072" title="ECOPEACE Party">
<text>The ECOPEACE Party is a national environmentalist political party in South Africa founded in 1995. The party was formerly known as eThekwini ECOPEACE and eThekwini Ecoparty—eThekwini is the Zulu name for Durban, where the party is based. The Zulu party motto is , which translates to &quot;Uproot Poisons, Replant Trees (or Medicine)&quot;.

==History==
ECOPEACE entered municipal elections in 1996 but failed to win a seat. In 2000 it won one seat in the eThekwini Municipal Council; this was the only Green seat in South Africa. ECOPEACE was not re-elected in the 2006 local elections, but its sister organisation Operation Khanyisa Movement (OKM), a fellow member of the Socialist Green Coalition (SGC) gained a seat in the Johannesburg City Council that year.

Although ECOPEACE is environmentalist in the broadest meaning of seeking sustainability of natural, built, social, economic, and political aspects etc. Global climate disruption and renewable energy production are major concerns.

==Ideology==

===Core beliefs===
====Peace====
As implied by its name, the party is anti-war, and supports peace based on freedom, equality, and justice for humans and the environment.

====Sustainability====
ECOPEACE is dedicated to environmental sustainability in areas such as economics, land development, and energy policy.

====Consensus====
The party supports consensus decision making, as expressed in practices such as parliamentary reforms and participatory, direct, and consensus democracy. In order to strengthen voter influence and accountability of public officials, ECOPEACE supports the right of recall of elected officials and transparency in campaign finance.

====Science====
The party sees rational science as a necessary component of informing political action and finding remedies for dangers to society and the environment, though it opposes the abuse of science to advance specific political goals.

===Energy policy===
The party opposes attempts by the ANC government and the DA opposition to continue financing of fossil carbon exploration and extraction, such as fracking in the Karoo, offshore drilling, and creation of new coal mines, even near the Cradle of Humankind where the danger of acid mine drainage exists. ECOPEACE contends that these parties dedicate only token sums to renewable energy and support policies which worsen global climate disruptions.

As an alternative, ECOPEACE supports changes in environmental policy and challenges against wealth concentration, such as the Great Transition. The party&#x27;s ideal energy policy would involve a distributed mix of wind and solar power, with storage on a smart grid. Other renewable technologies would supplement these primary sources, such as biogas, ocean power, and tidal power. In particular, ECOPEACE supports ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), a renewable energy technique with the potential to mitigate global climate disruption and mass extinction of marine life by taking heat directly out of oceans.

==Criticism==
The ANC government has threatened to revoke the electoral position of the ECOPEACE Party for protesting against the eThekwini Municipal Council, together with community members from Merebank; ECOPEACE helped elect Merebank local councillor Raja Naidoo, who was later assassinated.

==Affiliations==
ECOPEACE is a member of the Socialist Green Coalition.

<doc id="1179077" wikidata="Q7298110" url="?curid=1179077" title="Ray Simpson (soldier)">
<text>Rayene Stewart Simpson, (16 February 1926 – 18 October 1978), was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Simpson received his award for actions in Kon Tum Province, South Vietnam, on 6 May 1969.

==Early life==
Rayene Stewart Simpson was born on 16 February 1926 at Redfern in Sydney, the third child of New South Wales-born parents Robert William Simpson, labourer, and his wife Olga Maude, née Montgomery. Olga deserted her husband and children about 1931. Ray was separated from his siblings and placed in the Church of England Home for Boys in Carlingford. Educated at a local school and at Dumaresq Island Public School, Taree, he worked as a labourer.

==Military career==
Simpson joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 15 March 1944 and was posted to the 41st/2nd Battalion AIF, a training battalion that prepared soldiers for service in the Pacific campaigns. With this battalion, he was posted to Cowra as part of the prisoner of war camp garrison which had been reinforced after the Cowra breakout on 5 August 1944. He was subsequently posted to the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, while subsequent postings included the Advanced Ordnance Depot and the 26th Battalion. During this time he served in Morotai, Tarakan and Rabaul.

Demobilized in January 1947, Simpson spent four years working in various jobs in Australia and Papua New Guinea, before re-enlisting in the Army in 1951 to serve in the Korean War with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was promoted to lance corporal on 30 November 1951 and again to corporal on 21 January 1953. He married Shoko Sakai, a Japanese citizen, on 5 March 1952.

Simpson was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in January 1954, where he was promoted to sergeant in 1955, serving in Malaya from October 1955 for the next two years. He was subsequently posted to 1st Special Air Service Company (SAS) in November 1957 and served with that unit until selected as one of the initial group members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) sent to assist South Vietnamese forces in July 1962. A year later, he returned to the SAS in Australia and served there for the next twelve months.

His second tour of duty with AATTV in Vietnam commenced in July 1964, after being promoted to warrant officer class II. During his second tour, he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions when a patrol was ambushed at Tako on 16 September. Simpson, although severely wounded in the leg, held off the enemy while he called for assistance by radio. He and his men repelled several enemy assaults until help arrived, and none too soon as their ammunition was almost gone and Simpson was weak from loss of blood. He was evacuated by helicopter to the 6th Field Hospital at Nha Trang and later convalesced in Tokyo. On return to Australia, he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (Commando) in Sydney in January 1966.

On 16 May 1966, Simpson left the army for a second time, but re-enlisted in Saigon a year later for his third period of service with the AATTV, during which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He also received the United States Silver Star and Bronze Star for his actions in Vietnam.

===Victoria Cross===
Simpson was 43 years old, and a warrant officer class II in the AATTV, when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 6 May 1969, in Kon Tum Province, Simpson rescued a wounded fellow warrant officer and carried out an unsuccessful attack on a strong enemy position. On 11 May he fought alone against heavy odds to cover the evacuation of a number of casualties. Simpson was presented his Victoria Cross by Queen Elizabeth II, at Government House in Sydney, on 1 May 1970.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The citation in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 28 August 1969, which announced Simpson&#x27;s award reads:

==Later life and death==
Simpson took his final discharge from the army in May 1970. In 1972, he took up a position as administrative officer at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. He died of cancer in Tokyo on 18 October 1978 and was buried at the Yokohama War Cemetery, Japan. His Victoria Cross and portrait are displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

<text>Brunate (Comasco: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Como in northern Italy, some northeast of Milan. It has some 1,800 residents, but is much more populated in summer, when tourists rent houses and apartments.

The town overlooks Como, which lies on the shore of Lake Como some below. For a short time in the late 12th century Brunate was an independent commune, but in 1240 it reverted to the suzerainty of Como.

Como and Brunate are linked by a steep, narrow, winding road, and by the Como to Brunate funicular.

Alessandro Volta lived in Brunate for a short period – the Faro Voltiano lighthouse in the San Maurizio district, was built and named in his honour. The Bulgarian poet Pencho Slaveykov died in the town on 10 June 1912.

The website became massively popular in the aftermath of the presidential elections, leading some Bush supporters to create spinoffs to express they were &quot;not&quot; sorry.

The website was created by James Zetlen, an American neuroscience student who was at the time in the third year of his undergraduate program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The first photo was taken by Zetlen of himself, in his home in Los Angeles on November 3, 2004, after John Kerry conceding in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Zetlen&#x27;s photo inspired thousands more similar contributions from U.S. citizens, and he compiled a gallery of 8,000 of these photos on his website and published a 256-page book containing approximately 1,000 of them, entitled &quot;Sorry Everybody: An Apology to the World for the Re-election of George W. Bush&quot;.

After Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the 2008 presidential election, the site&#x27;s title changed to &quot;Hello Everybody,&quot; and Zetlen invited submissions again—this time of celebratory pictures of Americans reintroducing themselves to the world.

<text>Sarcosuchus (; ) is an extinct genus of crocodyliform and distant relative of living crocodilians that lived during the Early Cretaceous, from the late Hauterivian to the early Albian, 130 to 112 million years ago of what is now Africa and South America. The genus name comes from the Greek σάρξ (&quot;sarx&quot;) meaning flesh and σοῦχος (&quot;souchus&quot;) meaning crocodile. It was one of the largest pseudosuchians, with the largest specimen of &quot;S. imperator&quot; reaching approximately long and weighing up to . It is known from two species; &quot;S. imperator&quot; from the early Albian Elrhaz Formation of Niger, and &quot;S. hartti&quot; from the Late Hauterivian of northeastern Brazil. Other material is known from Morocco and Tunisia and possibly Libya and Mali.

The first remains were discovered during several expeditions led by the French paleontologist Albert-Félix de Lapparent, spanning from 1946 to 1959, in the Sahara. These remains were fragments of the skull, vertebrae, teeth, and scutes. In 1964, an almost complete skull was found in Niger by the French CEA, but it was not until 1997 and 2000 that most of its anatomy became known to science, when an expedition led by the American paleontologist Paul Sereno discovered six new specimens, including one with about half the skeleton intact and most of the spine.

== Description ==

&quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; is a distant relative of living crocodilians, with fully grown individuals estimated to have reached up to in total length and in weight. It had somewhat telescoped eyes and a long snout comprising 75% of the length of the skull. There were 35 teeth in each side of the upper jaw, while in the lower jaw there were 31 teeth in each side. The upper jaw was also noticeably longer than the lower one, leaving a gap between them when the jaws were shut that created an overbite. In young individuals the shape of the snout resembled that of the living gharial, but in fully grown individuals it became considerably broader.

=== Bulla ===
&quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; has an expansion at the end of its snout known as a bulla, which has been compared with the ghara seen in gharials. However, unlike the ghara, which is only found in male gharials, the bulla is present in all &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; skulls that have been found so far, suggesting that it was not a sexually dimorphic trait. The purpose of this structure is not known.

=== Osteoderms ===

The osteoderms, also known as dermal scutes, of &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; were similar to those goniopholodids like &quot;Sunosuchus&quot; and &quot;Goniopholis&quot;; they formed an uninterrupted surface that started in the posterior part of the neck down to the middle of the tail as is seen in &quot;Araripesuchus&quot; and other basal crocodyliforms; this differs from the pattern seen in living crocodiles, which presents discontinuity between the osteoderms of the neck and body.

=== Size ===

A common method to estimate the size of crocodiles and crocodile-like reptiles is the use of the length of the skull measured in the midline from the tip of the snout to the back of the skull table, as in living crocodilians there is a strong correlation between skull length and total body length in subadult and adult individuals irrespective of their sex. This method was used by Sereno &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) for &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; due to the absence of a complete enough skeleton. Two regression equations were used to estimate the size of &quot;S. imperator&quot;, they were created based on measurements gathered from 17 captive gharial individuals from northern India and from 28 wild saltwater crocodile individuals from northern Australia, both datasets supplemented by available measurements of individuals over in length found in the literature. The largest known skull of &quot;S. imperator&quot; (the type specimen) is long ( in the midline), and it was estimated that the individual it belonged to had a total body length of . Its snout-vent length of was estimated using linear equations for the saltwater crocodile and in turn this measurement was used to estimate its body weight at . This shows that &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; was able to reach a maximum body size not only greater than previously estimated but also greater than that of the Miocene &quot;Rhamphosuchus&quot;, the Late Cretaceous &quot;Deinosuchus,&quot; and the Miocene &quot;Purussaurus&quot; according to current estimates at that time.

However, extrapolation from the femur of a subadult individual as well as measurements of the skull width further showed that the largest &quot;S. imperator&quot; was significantly smaller than was estimated by Sereno &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) based on modern crocodilians. O’Brien &quot;et al.&quot; (2019) estimated the length of the largest &quot;S. imperator&quot; specimen at nearly and body mass at based on longirostrine crocodylian skull width to total length and body width ratio. The highest upper quartile reconstructed length and body mass for the specimen is and , respectively.
== Classification ==
&quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; is commonly classified as part of the clade Pholidosauridae, a group of crocodile-like reptiles (Crocodyliformes) related but outside Crocodylia (the clade containing living crocodiles, alligators and gharials). Within this group it is most closely related to the North American genus &quot;Terminonaris&quot;. Most members of Pholidosauridae had long, slender snouts and they all were aquatic, inhabiting several different environments. Some forms are interpreted as marine, capable of tolerating saltwater while others, like &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot;, were freshwater forms. The most primitive members of the clade, however, were found in coastal settings, zones mixing freshwater and marine waters. &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; stands out among pholidosaurids for being considered a generalist predator, different from most known members of the clade which were specialized piscivores. A 2019 study found it to be in a more derived position in Tethysuchia, being phylogenetically closer to Dyrosauridae.

Simplified cladogram after Fortier &quot;et al.&quot; (2011).
== Discovery and naming ==
=== Early findings ===
During the course of several expeditions on the Sahara from 1946 to 1959 which were led by the French paleontologist Albert-Félix de Lapparent, several fossils of a crocodyliform of large size were unearthed in the region known as the Continental Intercalaire Formation. Some of them were found in Foggara Ben Draou, in Mali and near the town of Aoulef, Algeria (informally named as the Aoulef Crocodile) while others came from the Ain el Guettar Formation of Gara Kamboute. In the south of Tunisia, the fossils found were fragments of the skull, teeth, scutes and vertebrae. In 1957, in the region now known as the Elrhaz Formation, several isolated teeth of great size were found by H. Faure. The study of this material by French paleontologist France De Broin helped identify them as coming from a long-snouted crocodile.

Later, in 1964, the research team of the French CEA discovered an almost complete skull in the region of Gadoufaoua in the Niger. The said skull was shipped to Paris for study and became the holotype of the then new genus and species &quot;Sarcosuchus imperator&quot; in 1966.

=== Fossils from Brazil ===

In 1977, a new species of &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; was recognised, &quot;S. hartti&quot;, from remains found in the late 19th century in late Hauterivian pebbly conglomerates and green shales belonging to the Ilhas Formation in the Recôncavo Basin of north-eastern Brazil. In 1867, American naturalist Charles Hartt found two isolated teeth and sent them to the American paleontologist O. C. Marsh who erected a new species of &quot;Crocodylus&quot; for them, &quot;C. hartti.&quot; This material, along with other remains were assigned in 1907 to the genus &quot;Goniopholis&quot; as &quot;G. hartti&quot;. Now residing in the British Museum of Natural History, the fragment of the lower jaw, dorsal scute and two teeth compromising the species &quot;G. hartti&quot; were reexamined and conclusively placed in the genus &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot;.

=== Recent findings ===

The next major findings occurred during the expeditions led by the American paleontologist Paul Sereno in 1995 (Aoufous Formation, Morocco), 1997 and the follow-up trip in 2000. Partial skeletons, numerous skulls and 20 tons of assorted other fossils were recovered from the deposits of the Elrhaz Formation, which has been dated as late Aptian or early Albian stages of the Late Cretaceous. It took about a year to prepare the &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; remains.

A tooth enamel from the Ifezouane Formation (lower Kem Kem beds) of Morocco was identified as cf. &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot;. Fossil teeth from the area of Nalut in northwestern Libya, possibly Hauterivian to Barremian in age, might be referable to &quot;S. imperator&quot;. Indeterminate &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; material including dorsal osteoderms in anatomical connection, isolated teeth and fragmentary skeletal remains including a left scapula, mandible fragment, dorsal vertebrae, ilium and a proximal portion of a femur was described from the Oum Ed Dhiab Member in Tunisia in 2018.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Growth pattern ===
Sereno took thin sections from trunk osteoderms of an estimated subadult individual (~80% of estimated maximum adult size). Approximately 40 lines of arrested growth (LAG) were counted in these thin sections, suggesting that &quot;S. imperator&quot; took 50 to 60 years to reach adult size. Given that extant wild crocodylians rarely reach these advanced ages, Sereno suggested that &quot;S. imperator&quot; achieved its large size by extending its period of rapid, juvenile, growth. A similar growth strategy has been suggested for the equally titanic crocodylian &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, based on similar criteria.

=== Diet ===
Based on the broader snout of fully grown &quot;S. imperator &quot;when compared with the living gharial and other narrow-snouted crocodiles, along with a lack of interlocking of the smooth and sturdy-crowned teeth when the jaws were closed, Sereno &quot;et al.&quot; hypothesized that &quot;S. imperator&quot; had a generalized diet similar to that of the Nile crocodile, which would have included large terrestrial prey such as the abundant dinosaurs that lived in the same region.

However, a 2014 analysis of a biomechanical model of its skull suggested that unlike &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; may not have been able to perform the &quot;death roll&quot; maneuver used by extant crocodilians to dismember their prey. This suggests that if &quot;S. imperator&quot; did hunt big game, it probably did not dismember prey in the same fashion as extant crocodilians.

=== Habitat ===
The remains of &quot;S. imperator&quot; were found in a region of the Ténéré Desert named Gadoufaoua, more specifically in the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group, dating from the late Aptian to the early Albian of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 112 million years ago. The stratigraphy of the region and the aquatic fauna that was found therein indicates that it was an inland fluvial environment, entirely freshwater in nature with a humid tropical climate. &quot;S. imperator&quot; shared the waters with the holostean fish &quot;Lepidotus&quot; and the coelacanth &quot;Mawsonia&quot;. The dinosaur fauna was represented by the iguanodontian &quot;Lurdusaurus&quot;, which was the most common dinosaur in the region, and its relative &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;; there were also two sauropods, &quot;Nigersaurus&quot; and a currently unnamed sauropod while the theropod fauna included the spinosaurid &quot;Suchomimus,&quot; the carcharodontosaurid &quot;Eocarcharia&quot; and the abelisaurid &quot;Kryptops&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;S. hartti&quot; was found in the Recôncavo Basin of Brazil, specifically in the Ilhas Formation of the Bahia series. It was a shallow lacustrine environment dating from the late Aptian, similar in age to the habitat of &quot;S. imperator&quot;, with similar aquatic fauna, including &quot;Lepidotus&quot; and two species of &quot;Mawsonia&quot;. The dinosaur fauna is of a very fragmentary nature and identification does not go beyond indeterminate theropod and iguanodontid remains.

<text>Carlisle Albert Herman Trost (April 24, 1930 – September 29, 2020) was a United States Navy officer who served as the 23rd Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from July 1, 1986, to June 29, 1990. He oversaw the Navy during the end of the Cold War. He retired from active naval service on July 1, 1990, following completion of a four-year term as CNO.

==Early life and education==
Trost was born in Valmeyer, Illinois, on April 24, 1930. Trost graduated first in his United States Naval Academy class of 1953 and was commissioned as an ensign. 

==Career==
Trost volunteered and was accepted to begin submarine training in 1954 and once again graduated first in his class from Submarine School in New London, Connecticut. During his more than thirty-seven years of commissioned service, Trost served at sea in destroyers and diesel-powered and nuclear submarines, including tours as executive officer of two nuclear-powered submarines and as commanding officer of a Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine. 

After selection to flag rank in 1973, Trost commanded Submarine Flotilla One/Submarine Group FIVE. Later operational assignments included deputy commander, United States Pacific Fleet; commander, Seventh Fleet (1980–1981); Commander-in-Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet (1985–1986), and deputy commander, United States Atlantic Command. 

Trost served as military assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, executive assistant to the Secretary of the Navy, and on the Navy Staff as Director, Systems Analysis Division, Assistant Chief of Naval Personnel and Director, Navy Program Planning.

In May 1986, Trost was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to succeed Admiral James D. Watkins as Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Trost served as CNO from July 1, 1986, to June 29, 1990. He was succeeded by Admiral Frank B. Kelso.

==Awards and decorations==

Trost was an Olmsted Scholar. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America as an adult, an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

==Organizational affiliations==
Trost was recognized as a distinguished graduate of the United States Naval Academy and also served on the board of directors of the Alumni Association, as well as President of the Class of &#x27;53. A classmate and another past President of the Class of &#x27;53 was the late Texas businessman and former presidential candidate H. Ross Perot.

==Post-naval career==
Since his retirement from the Navy, Trost served on the boards of directors of a number of corporations. He served as Chairman of the Board of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association in a term that ended in Spring 2009. Trost died on September 29, 2020, at the age of 90.

<doc id="1179101" wikidata="Q295261" url="?curid=1179101" title="AMP Limited">
<text>AMP Limited (formerly Australian Mutual Provident Society) is an Australian financial services company that operates in Australia and New Zealand. It offers superannuation and investment products, financial advice and banking services through &quot;AMP Banking&quot;, including home loans and savings accounts. AMP is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. The company previously operated a global investment management business through its subsidiary AMP Capital.

AMP has one of Australia&#x27;s largest shareholder registers, with most shareholders living in Australia and New Zealand. This is because when the society demutualised, all policy holders received shares in the new company. 

On 20 April 2018, Craig Meller resigned as CEO after it was revealed in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry that AMP charged clients for financial advice which was not provided, and misled the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission on numerous occasions. At that time more than $1 billion in market value was stripped from AMP shares as news of the company&#x27;s failings were revealed before the Royal Commission. In the wake of revelations at the banking royal commission and his resignation from AMP, Meller resigned as a financial services adviser to the Turnbull government.

==History==
===1848 to 1998===

On 31 August 1848, a group of businessmen, including Thomas Holt Jnr, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, and William Perry, met to form an organisation to provide life assurance to Australians, leading to the establishment of the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP). Life expectancy at the time was low, and risks like disease and accidents were common. As a mutual society, AMP raised no initial capital and had no shareholders, relying on its members. The Society’s goal was to provide financial security for families through life insurance and annuities. AMP&#x27;s rules were registered on 28 December 1848 under the Friendly Societies&#x27; Act of New South Wales. 

David Jones was a foundation director in 1848.

The Australian Mutual Provident Society was formed in 1849 as a non-profit, life-insurance company, and mutual society. George King was chairman for fifteen years from the 1850s. Richard Teece was general manager and actuary from 1890 and a director from 1917 to 1927.

AMP began operations on 1 January 1849 at 470 George Street, Sydney, in a small upstairs office. Due to uncertain business, the office was open just 1-2 hours daily. The first policy was issued on 25 February 1849 to AMP&#x27;s secretary, William Perry, marking the first policy from an Australian insurance company.

AMP expanded by recruiting local agents across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. Initially, most policies were sold to AMP&#x27;s own members, with the first external policies issued in March 1849. The company faced challenges educating the public on insurance and annuities, but by April 1851, AMP reached 100 policies.

In the 1850s, AMP expanded with agents in Auckland and Hobart. Perry, a key figure in AMP’s early success, passed away in 1855. The company provided support to his widow and children in recognition of his contributions.

In 1876, the first New Zealand AMP centre was built in Wellington. In 1910, AMP became the first company to provide assurance to soldiers. In 1960, AMP opened its Auckland office. 

1976 the Quay Quarter Tower in Sydney, one of the biggest skyscrapers in the city, was initially built as the AMP centre. 

In 1989, it acquired the London Life Association.

In 1998, AMP was demutualised into an Australian public company, AMP Limited, and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and New Zealand Stock Exchange. In 1999, AMP launched AMP Banking, an online bank. In 2003, the company demerged its UK operations, creating the Henderson Group. 

AMP headquarters moved to the AMP Building on Alfred Street in 2018, although the Tower is still owned by AMP CapitalMany of the older AMP buildings in Australia are now heritage-listed and feature the &quot;Amicus&quot; statue group. The central figure in the statue group is the goddess of Peace and Plenty, holding a palm branch (signifying peace) and a cornucopia (symbolising plenty). The male figure of Labour sits to her left and also holds the cornucopia, while the figures of the wife and the child sit on the goddess&#x27;s right under her palm branch. Under the statue is AMP Society&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;Amicus certus in re incerta&quot; (&quot;A certain friend in uncertain times&quot;). The importance of Amicus was also demonstrated through the ultimate award bestowed upon AMP&#x27;s highest achieving advisers, Amicus membership.

===1998-2011===
In 2003, the company demerged its UK operations, creating the Henderson Group.

=== AXA merger (2011)===
On 15 November 2010, AMP announced a bid to merge its business with AXA Asia Pacific Holdings. The transaction was a joint proposal with Axa under which Axa would acquire Axa Asia Pacific Holdings&#x27;s Asian business&#x27; and AMP would acquire AXA&#x27;s Australian and New Zealand business. 

The Australasian holdings included the former National Mutual business (established in 1869) which was demutualised in 1996. AXA had gained majority ownership of National Mutual in 1999 and renamed the company as AXA Asia Pacific.

The first day of the merged group operating together was 31 March 2011, with the companies to be gradually integrated and the AXA brand being phased out of the Australian and New Zealand market by 2013. In February 2022, AMP delisted from the NZX, consolidating its listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. 

===Royal commission (2018)===
On 20 April 2018 Craig Meller resigned as CEO after it was revealed in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry that AMP charged clients for financial advice which was not provided, and misled the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission on numerous occasions. More than $1 billion in market value was stripped from AMP shares as news of the company&#x27;s failings were revealed before the Royal Commission. In the wake of revelations at the banking royal commission and his resignation from AMP, Meller resigned as a financial services adviser to the Turnbull government.

On 30 April 2018, Catherine Brenner resigned as chairperson with Mike Wilkins appointed acting CEO and chairperson.

On 8 May 2018, directors Vanessa Wallace and Holly Kramer announced they would not be seeking re-election, in response to an imminent protest vote organised by the shareholders in the aftermath of the Banking Royal Commission. Patty Akopiantz also announced she would be resigning at the end of the year.

In November 2018, AMP admitted to a second overcharging scandal.

In 2019, CEO Francesco De Ferrari launched a billion dollar transformation plan, aiming to recalibrate public opinion on AMP post royal commission.

In July 2021, the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission launched a case against AMP in the Federal Court, seeking pecuniary penalties and orders to publish an apology over the &#x27;fee for no service&#x27; scandal, where the company would deduct a fee from client&#x27;s accounts without performing a service. In September 2022, AMP was fined $14.6 million by the Federal Court. AMP had, as of August 2022, paid back $627 million to 331,994 customers affected by the scandal.

===2018 - present ===
AMP board appointed Franceso De Ferrari as Chief Executive Officer of AMP Limited on 1 December 2018.

<doc id="1179103" wikidata="Q184909" url="?curid=1179103" title="Flyback transformer">
<text>A flyback transformer (FBT), also called a line output transformer (LOPT), is a special type of electrical transformer. It was initially designed to generate high-voltage sawtooth signals at a relatively high frequency. In modern applications, it is used extensively in switched-mode power supplies for both low (3 V) and high voltage (over 10 kV) supplies.

==History==
The flyback transformer circuit was invented as a means of controlling the horizontal movement of the electron beam in a cathode-ray tube (CRT). Unlike conventional transformers, a flyback transformer is not fed with a signal of the same waveshape as the intended output current. A convenient side effect of such a transformer is the considerable energy that is available in its magnetic circuit. This can be exploited using extra windings to provide power to operate other parts of the equipment. In particular, very high voltages are easily obtained using relatively few turns of windings which, after rectification, can provide a very high accelerating voltage for a CRT. Many more recent applications of such a transformer dispense with the need to produce high voltages and use the device as a relatively efficient means of producing a wide range of lower voltages using a transformer that is much smaller than a conventional mains transformer.

==Operation and usage==

The primary winding of the flyback transformer is driven by a switch from a DC supply (usually a transistor). When the switch is switched on, the primary inductance causes the current to build up in a ramp. An integral diode connected in series with the secondary winding prevents the formation of a secondary current that would eventually oppose the primary current ramp. 

When the switch is turned off, the current in the primary falls to zero. The energy stored in the magnetic core is released to the secondary as the magnetic field in the core collapses. The voltage in the output winding rises very quickly (usually less than a microsecond) until the load conditions limit it. Once the voltage reaches such a level as to allow a secondary current, the charge flow is like a descending ramp.

The cycle can then be repeated. If the secondary current is allowed to drop completely to zero (no energy stored in the core), then it is said that the transformer works in &quot;discontinuous mode&quot;. When the secondary current is always non-zero (some energy is always stored in the core), then this is &quot;continuous mode&quot;. This terminology is used especially in power supply transformers.

The low voltage output winding mirrors the sawtooth of the primary current and, e.g. for television purposes, has fewer turns than the primary, thus providing a higher current. This is a ramped and pulsed waveform that repeats at the horizontal (line) frequency of the display. The flyback (the vertical portion of the sawtooth wave) can be a potential problem for the flyback transformer if the energy has nowhere to go: the faster a magnetic field collapses, the greater the induced voltage, which, if not controlled, can flash over the transformer terminals. The high frequency used permits the use of a much smaller transformer. In television sets, this high frequency is about 15 kilohertz (15.625 kHz for PAL, 15.734 kHz for NTSC), and vibrations from the transformer core caused by magnetostriction can often be heard as a high-pitched whine. In CRT-based computer displays, the frequency can vary over a wide range, from about 30 kHz to 150 kHz.

The transformer can be equipped with extra windings whose sole purpose is to induce a relatively large voltage pulse when the magnetic field collapses as the input switch is turned off. There is considerable energy stored in the magnetic field, and coupling it out via extra windings helps it to collapse quickly, and avoids the voltage flash over that might otherwise occur. The pulse train coming from the flyback transformer windings is converted to direct current by a simple half-wave rectifier. There is no point in using a full wave design as there are no corresponding pulses of opposite polarity. One turn of a winding often produces pulses of several volts. In older television designs, the transformer produced the required high voltage for the CRT accelerating voltage directly with the output rectified by a simple rectifier. In more modern designs, the rectifier is replaced by a voltage multiplier. Color television sets must also use a regulator to control the high voltage. The earliest sets used a shunt vacuum tube regulator, but the introduction of solid-state sets employed a simpler voltage-dependent resistor. The rectified voltage is then used to supply the final anode of the cathode-ray tube.

There are often auxiliary windings that produce lower voltages for driving other parts of the television circuitry. The voltage used to bias the varactor diodes in modern tuners is often derived from the flyback transformer (&quot;Line OutPut Transformer&quot; LOPT). In tube sets, a one or two-turn filament winding is located on the opposite side of the core as the HV secondary, used to drive the HV rectifier tube&#x27;s heater.

==Practical considerations==
In modern displays, the LOPT, voltage multiplier, and rectifier are often integrated into a single package on the main circuit board. There is usually a thickly insulated wire from the LOPT to the anode terminal (covered by a rubber cap) on the side of the picture tube.

One advantage of operating the transformer at the flyback frequency is that it can be much smaller and lighter than a comparable transformer operating at mains (line) frequency. Another advantage is that it provides a failsafe mechanism — should the horizontal deflection circuitry fail, the flyback transformer will cease operating and shut down the rest of the display, preventing the screen burn-in that would otherwise result from a stationary electron beam.

== Construction ==
The primary is wound first around a ferrite rod, and then the secondary is wound around the primary. This arrangement minimizes the leakage inductance of the primary. Finally, a ferrite frame is wrapped around the primary/secondary assembly, closing the magnetic field lines. Between the rod and the frame is an air gap, which increases the reluctance. The secondary is wound layer by layer with enameled wire, and Mylar film between the layers. In this way, parts of the wire with a higher voltage have more dielectric material.

==Applications==

The flyback transformer operates CRT-display devices such as television sets and CRT computer monitors. The voltage and frequency can each range over a wide scale, depending on the device. For example, a large color TV CRT may require 20 to 50 kV with a horizontal scan rate of 15.734 kHz for NTSC devices and 15.625 kHz for PAL devices. Unlike a power (or &quot;mains&quot;) transformer, which uses an alternating current of 50 or 60 hertz, a flyback transformer typically operates with switched currents at much higher frequencies in the range of 15 kHz to 50 kHz.

<doc id="1179106" wikidata="Q5924445" url="?curid=1179106" title="Hsuan Chuang University">
<text>Hsuan Chuang University (HCU; ) is a private Buddhist university in Xiangshan District, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. Founded in 1997 by the Ven. Liao Zhong (了中; ) and named for the Tang dynasty monk Xuanzang, the school was promoted to university status in 1993. It offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, mainly in humanities subjects.

==History==
Before 1985, the government of Taiwan maintained strict controls on private universities and, in particular, discouraged university-level religious education. For several decades, senior officials of the Buddhist Association of the Republic of China (BAROC) pressured the government to overturn these restrictions and allow a private Buddhist university similar to the Fu Jen Catholic University.

Informal resistance from the Ministry of Education persisted into the 1990s. One obstacle was that the Ministry of Education claimed that as a religious affair, jurisdiction over the proposal lay with the Ministry of the Interior—which, in turn, maintained that as an educational institution, responsibility lay with the Ministry of Education. Before 1990, the working group had reconciled itself to creating a technical college (which could be accredited) alongside an unaccredited seminary, in preparation for a time when the government might accredit it as a religious studies department.

The political thaw and economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s erased many of the obstacles facing the venture. However, these events also had the effect of encouraging charismatic Buddhist teachers to build their own organizations and institutions—including universities—separately from BAROC. Examples included Tzu Chi University, Fo Guang University, Huafan University, Nanhua University, and Dharma Drum Buddhist College). The &quot;rump&quot; project was led by Liao Zhong, a monk and BAROC official who would ultimately chair Hsuan Chuang&#x27;s board of directors.

Hsinchu was chosen as the school&#x27;s location for its proximity to the Buddhist teachers resident in north Taiwan and for its cheap land prices relative to Taipei. Government approval for the location was another significant hurdle in the application process. The school is in a semi-agricultural area on the outskirts of Hsinchu, next to Yuanpei University of Medical Technology and down the road from Chung Hua University. The prospect of a merger between these schools is regularly broached.

In 2008, the school was reevaluated by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, as a result of which one-third of its departments were placed on probation. Underlying this development is demographic pressure resulting from a dearth of university-age young people and a corresponding glut of colleges and universities (many of very marginal quality). In 2010 it was announced that HCU passed the re-evaluation (though several departments were closed) for the next five years.

==The name==
A &quot;contest&quot; was held to decide the name of the new school, but none of the hundreds of entries were used.

One name favored by the working group was Chung Hua University, chosen for its lack of explicit Buddhist content. &quot;Chung Hua&quot; refers to Chinese culture and/or the Republic of China, but a (non-Buddhist) university project was discovered to be using this name. Xuanzang Technical College was another working name for the planned institution. The school finally opened under the name of Hsuan Chuang College of Humanities and Social Science (玄奘人文社會學院, Xuanzang Renwen Shehui Xueyuan). However, the name Hsuan Chuang University was in use well before government approval of its university status.

As spelled on all school signage, &quot;Hsuan Chuang&quot; follows the Wade-Giles phonetic standard that would equate to Pinyin &quot;Xuán Zhuǎng&quot; (but not &quot;zàng&quot;). The character in question, 奘, has two pronunciations, one associated with its &quot;bound&quot; form, and the other with its unbound and stative-verb form; they have slightly different ranges of denotations. As a result, there are, in effect, two phonetic &quot;interpretations&quot; of the name of the historical monk alluded to (i.e., Tang dynasty monk Xuanzang).

==Character==
Although founded by Buddhists, Hsuan Chuang University is broadly indistinguishable from other lower-tier private universities in Taiwan. There are no religious requirements or restrictions (these would not be allowed by the Ministry of Education) and, except for a handful of monks and nuns, religion does not seem to be an important factor in attracting students.

It is indicative that the university (in April 2011) served meat to its students—indeed, there are no vegetarian options in the student dining hall. However, the religious studies program has an extensive set of courses on Buddhism, including specialized courses in
* Taiwanese Buddhism
* Sanskrit
* Taoism, Confucianism, and the major historical schools of Chinese Buddhist thought

<text>National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) was a public research university in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Established in 1896 as Nanyang Public School by an imperial edict of the Guangxu Emperor, it was one of China&#x27;s leading universities. After the Chinese Civil War, NCTU was re-established by former Chiao Tung University faculty and alumni in Taiwan in 1958.

NCTU was selected by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Educations as one of the seven national universities focused on research in 2002. It was subsequently chosen to pursue all-around excellence with &quot;versatile international competitiveness to continuously strengthen international academic influence and visibility&quot;.

NCTU was merged with National Yang-Ming University into the newly formed National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University on 1 February 2021.

== History ==

===Qing dynasty===
National Chiao Tung University was founded in Xujiahui, the suburbs of Shanghai in 1896, sixteen years before the birth of the Republic of China, at the suggestion of Sheng Xuanhuai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Qing dynasty. The university was first named Nanyang College. It was established to meet the need to introduce western civilization into China. The college focused only on politics, law, and translations of western books. In the later years of the Qing dynasty, the college was renamed the Vocational College of Higher Education and was governed by the Ministry of Post and Transportation. By including new vocational programs, such as business, electrical engineering, shipping management, and railway management, the college played a major role in science and engineering education in modern China.

The Ministry of Post and Transportation in the Qing dynasty expanded the college by developing three other campuses - the Railway College in Tang-Shan (established in 1905), the Railway Management College in Peiping (1910), and the Merchant Marine College in Wu-Sun (1911).

===Republic of China===
After the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the four campuses of the college were reorganized and governed by the Ministry of Transportation, which evolved from the original Qing dynasty Ministry of Post and Transportation. The names of the Vocational College of Higher Education, the Railway College, and the Railway Management College were changed respectively to the Shanghai Industrial College, the Tang-Shan Industrial College, and the College of Management in Railway, Post and Telecommunications. In 1921, the Ministry of Transportation united these three campuses under a single name: Chiao Tung University. The university reorganized its administrative systems, enlarged its facilities, and formed a new board of trustees. Later on, these three campuses were separated and reunited several times and their names were changed repeatedly because of political turmoil.

In 1926 the Shanghai campus established its Institute of Industry, which was devoted to telecommunication research. At the end of the Northern Expedition in 1928, the university resumed the name of Chiao Tung University and was governed by the newly established Ministry of Railways of the nationalist government. The Shanghai campus thereafter developed into four Colleges: the Colleges of Railway Management, the Colleges of Civil Engineering, the Colleges of Mechanical Engineering, and the Colleges of Electrical Engineering. In 1930, the College of Science consisting of three departments: Mathematics, Science, and Chemistry, was added to the campus. At the same time, the Institute of Industry in Shanghai was expanded to include the Institute of Industry and the Institute of Economics.

In 1937, along with all the other higher education in China, the university came under the authority of the Ministry of Education. During the Sino-Japanese war, the university was relocated to the French Concession in Shanghai and then to various places in central China, such as Chung Ching, Hsiang Tan, and Pin Yueh. At the end of the war, all sectors of the university returned to their original campuses. Shortly afterwards the university was dissolved when the communists gained control of the Chinese mainland in 1949.

In 1957, due to the insistence of Chiao Tung University alumni at home and abroad and in view of the importance of developing the electronic industry for the national economy and defense, the Ministries of Education, Communications, Economic Affairs, and National Defense jointly recommended to the Executive Yuan that the university be reestablished at its present location in Hsinchu, Taiwan. A preparatory committee was appointed, with Mr. H.H. Lin, former president of the university, serving as the chairman. In July 1958, the establishment of the National Chiao Tung University Institute of Electronics was formally recognized by the government. The institute was to offer a two-year graduate program leading to the degree of Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. S. M. Lee was appointed as the institute&#x27;s first director.

In compliance with a contract between the Ministry of Education and the United Association of International Telecommunications, the Telecommunication and Electronics Training Center (TETC) was established at the Hsinchu campus in 1961, with special funding from the United Nations. The TETC introduced computer technology, initiating television broadcasting, and manufacturing the island&#x27;s first transistors and solid-state lasers.

As a result of TETC&#x27;s success, the Computer and Electronics Center was established in 1962. Later, in response to requests from the alumni and to the directives given by the Ministry of Education, two undergraduate departments were organized at NCTU in 1964: the Department of Electrophysics and the Department of Electronic Engineering. In the same year, construction commenced on the university&#x27;s Semiconductor Research Laboratory. In 1965, the Department of Control Engineering and the Department of Communication Engineering were established. In May 1967, the Institute of Electronics was formally transformed into the College of Engineering, which then included the Institute of Electronics and four undergraduate programs. K. K. Chung became the first president of the university, serving from 1967 to 1969. He was succeeded by Mr. H.C. Liu, NCTU&#x27;s president from 1969 to 1972.

In 1968, the university started a Ph.D. program in the area of electronics. It was the first program to offer graduate study at the doctoral level in science and technology in Taiwan. Besides, within the College of Engineering, the Institute of Management Science was founded in 1970, and the Department of Management Science was founded in 1971.

In 1972, C. L. Shen became the president of the university. During Shen&#x27;s tenure, the university expanded rapidly, setting up the Department of Computer Engineering (1972), the Department of Navigation and Marine Engineering (1973), the Department of Ocean Transportation (1973), the Department of Transportation Management (1974) (the latter two departments were combined into the Department of Transport Engineering and Management in 1980), the Institute of Computer Science (1974), the Institute of Traffic and Transportation (1976), the Department of Mechanical Engineering (1976), the Institute of Applied Mathematics (1977), and the Department of Civil Engineering (1978). In addition, during this period the university conducted a national-level electronics research project with support from the National Science Council of the R.O.C.

In August 1978, , an alumnus of NCTU&#x27;s Hsinchu campus, was appointed the president of the university. During his presidency, the school matured into a complete university, consisting of twelve departments and twelve graduate Institutes. These programs were divided into three colleges - the College of Science, the College of Engineering, and the College of Management.

The graduate institutes established under Kuo&#x27;s leadership included: the Institute of Information Science (1980), the Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering (1980), the Institute of Applied Chemistry (1981), the Institute of Control Engineering (1982), and the Institute of Mechanical Engineering (1982). In 1982, the Semiconductor Research Center was set up in cooperation with the National Science Council. In 1984, the Microelectronics and Information Science and Technology Research Center was founded. The Department of Navigation and Marine Engineering was incorporated into the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management. In 1985, the Institute of Civil Engineering was established within the College of Engineering.

Negotiations on a merger between National Yang-ming University and National Chiao Tung University began in December 2018. Both educational institutions voted to proceed with the merger in September 2019, which was approved by the Ministry of Education in June 2020. The two universities merged into National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in February 2021.

<text>The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad was a police unit in the English West Midlands which operated from 1974 to 1989. It was disbanded after an investigation into allegations of incompetence and abuse of power on the part of some of the squad&#x27;s members. Some of this misconduct resulted in wrongful convictions, including the high-profile case of the Birmingham Six. The sister Regional Crime Squad based at Bilston was responsible for the investigation of the Bridgewater Four.

At least 40 convictions failed in the 1980s as a result of likely malpractice, including tampering with evidence. As cases began to regularly collapse in the late 1980s, pressure mounted to investigate the squad. Clare Short raised the issue in Parliament in January 1989. The Birmingham Six&#x27;s convictions were quashed in 1991. A series of other less high-profile convictions based on the squad&#x27;s investigations were quashed on appeal, including the cases of George Glen Lewis, Keith Twitchell and, on 17 October 2014, Martin Foran, who had been wrongly convicted in 1978 for four counts of robbery. As of January 2017 a total of 60 appellants have had their convictions quashed. A total of over 100 cases either collapsed or were quashed on appeal.

In August 1989, the squad was shut down by the Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear, and the West Yorkshire Police was asked by the Police Complaints Authority to investigate the squad&#x27;s activities from 1986 onwards. This meant that the Birmingham Six case was out of scope, as was that of the Bridgewater Four, although there was cross over of staff with the regional squad. The West Yorkshire Police reported in 1994, leading to disciplinary action against seven officers, but recommended against prosecutions for lack of evidence. Ten officers had avoided disciplinary action by leaving or retiring early, while around 100 received advice about police procedures. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills agreed with the report&#x27;s view and did not attempt to prosecute any officers, and was widely criticised for this decision.

==History==
===Formation of the Squad===

The Serious Crime Squad (SCS) was formed in 1974 when the West Midlands Police was created by the Local Government Act 1972, merging Birmingham City Police with parts of a number of other forces that covered the new West Midlands area. The Squad&#x27;s roots go back to 1952, when a Special Crime Squad was formed on an experimental basis. It successfully dealt with a number of metal thieves, a crime that had grown due to the growth of scrap metal collection from bomb sites in the post-War era. A second Regional Crime Squad was formed, to deal with crimes outside of Birmingham, with officers from neighbouring counties. In 1960, when the squad was known as the Birmingham Crime Squad, it detected over 1,060 crimes a year, and made 579 arrests. However, annual reports emphasise that the seriousness of the crimes rather than the quantity was the key factor in performance.

===Early work===
The squad dealt with the Birmingham pub bombings in 1974, bringing its work to national attention. It continued to deal with anti-terrorist investigations until 1979, when a separate squad was formed. This meant that the SCS had to reorient its own work primarily towards armed robberies. Also in 1979, the SCS moved to share offices with other West Midlands police units in Lloyd House.

In 1979–80, the SCS investigated a spate of armed robberies known as the &#x27;Thursday Robberies&#x27; because they always took place on Thursdays. The gang was known as the &quot;Thursday Gang&quot; by the police. The SCS and the Robbery Squads worked together to catch the criminals responsible in &quot;Operation Cat&quot;. The 1991 Independent Report into the SCS states that &quot;many Midlands solicitors we have spoken to believe [this operation] gave the green light to some officers ... to indulge in serious malpractice&quot;. The arrests included Ronald, Donald, and John Brown, whose convictions were later quashed.

After the murder of a security guard in 1980, SCS arrested two alleged criminals for armed robbery, John Irvine and Keith Twitchell, whose convictions were also later quashed.

===1980s and declining performance===
By 1982, the number of arrests by SCS had declined to under 200, and remained approximately this low through the 1980s, despite a steady increase in reported crime and arrests made in the West Midlands. As a percentage of arrests made by West Midlands Police as a whole, their work was declining. Furthermore, many of the arrests were in practice for less than serious crimes. Burglary and theft accounted for around half of the arrests made. Explanations put forward included that criminals were becoming more sophisticated and were less &quot;amenable&quot; to making confessions. In 1988, the West Midlands Police explained that &quot;Investigations are more protracted, and masks, disguises, false number plates and other means of evading capture are frequently used&quot;, techniques which are hardly unusual among hardened criminals committing serious crimes. Kaye concludes that police management knew that these excuses were thin, and that the squad was underperforming throughout the 1980s.

In 1984, the squad began to rely heavily on &#x27;supergrass&#x27; evidence. These later proved unreliable, but did lead to a number of high-profile arrests. By the mid 1980s, colleagues &quot;resented the &#x27;support of the squad, thus avoided collaboration and referrals, further reducing the squad&#x27;s ability to pursue serious crime.

The District Auditor strongly criticised the organisation&#x27;s poor management in 1985 and 1989. The West Midlands police claimed that the SCS was being reorganised in 1988, with changes to recruitment practices, just before it was closed down.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should have changed many practices at the SCS, for instance by introducing the recording of interviews, and was noted as implemented in the 1986 annual report. Subsequent evidence however shows that its provisions were being widely ignored or evaded.

===Rising concerns===
Throughout the 1980s, there were concerns about the safety of the Birmingham Six convictions. Chris Mullin campaigned as an MP to see their convictions reviewed. Concerns about the Bridgewater Four, who had been investigated by the sister No 4 Regional Crime Squad, were investigated by Paul Foot.

A number of cases had been overturned in the 1980s and several members of the squad were seen to be unreliable witnesses. However, concerns were given particular credence due to a new forensic technique, using a machine known as an ESDA, or &quot;Electrostatic Detection Apparatus&quot;. The technique allowed forensic experts to trace impressions made on sheets of paper underneath the original, often showing when words or lines had been added to original statements. The first of the cases using this evidence was that of Paul Dandy, in 1987.

In January 1989 Clare Short, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, raised in Parliament the problems that Birmingham solicitors had encountered when trying to raise complaints about their clients&#x27; cases in relation to the squad. She detailed the apparently widespread practice the squad employed of doctoring statements by adding additional incriminating pages, which was leading to certain convictions being challenged. Nevertheless, the systemic issues at the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad were not being addressed, such as the apparent culture of making shortcuts and abusing procedure in order to perform well enough to qualify for promotion.

===Disbandment and investigation===
In August 1989, the squad was disbanded by Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear and a number of its senior officers were put on desk duties. In the same month, an investigation by West Yorkshire Police led by Assistant Chief Constable Donald Shaw was asked to examine allegations of misconduct at the squad. However, its remit was limited to complaints made after the start of 1986 &quot;when complaints about the squad started to emerge&quot;. The question of whether the convictions in the Birmingham pub bombings case were safe was raised at the time, but was considered out of scope and unnecessary by the government. A number of the former SCS officers that had been placed on desk duties were returned to investigatory roles in 1990, after Dear left for another post and was replaced by Ronald Hadfield.

===Inquiries and decision not to prosecute officers===
The Civil Liberties Trust funded Birmingham University legal academic Tim Kaye to lead an independent inquiry, backed by an advisory panel including Clare Short and the Bishop of Birmingham Mark Santer. It reported in 1991, three years before the official inquiry, and presented evidence of systemic malpractice and patterns of fabrication of evidence and other procedural abuses by specific officers.

The official PCA report was published in 1994 and concluded that there had been &quot;physical abuse of prisoners, fabrication of admissions, planting of evidence and mishandling of informants&quot;. However, just seven officers faced disciplinary action as a result of the report, for 28 disciplinary complaints. One officer faced a complaint about tampering with a statement, while the other six were suspected of irregularities relating to payments to informers. A further ten officers would have faced 20 complaints, but had left or retired. Another 102 officers were given informal advice about their failures to adhere to police procedures. The disciplinary procedures were conducted as an internal matter. However, the report recommended that no officers should face criminal charges.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, agreed that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute any officer at the squad, a decision for which she was widely criticised. Although no officers were prosecuted for their roles in corrupt investigations, former West Midlands Serious Crime Squad detective Laurence Henry Shaw was later convicted of attempted robbery in Solihull in 2001 and in 2010 for armed robbery in Lostwithiel, Cornwall.

==Issues and malpractice==
The SCS suffered from a number of issues, ranging from poor recruitment and management practices, to well-documented and repeated techniques of falsification. Poor management led to poor performance, which in turn exacerbated the pressure on officers to take shortcuts.

===Management issues===
The SCS had an &#x27;elite&#x27; ethos, which may have induced a certain amount of arrogance when dealing with other investigators. Recruitment was usually through choice rather than open recruitment. The SCS was an all male, probably wholly white unit; officers tended to serve for long periods rather than move regularly, and were allowed to work very long overtime hours. These factors may have together reinforced an insular culture. There are also recorded incidents of bullying of officers who reported malpractice.

The general West Midlands interview manual was criticised as being misleading and advising officers to assume guilt in a range of situations where this may not be true. The manual appeared to be a compendium of techniques and experience from officers rather than being based on independent psychological research and evidence. Reactions to interviews are made under stress and therefore need to be treated with caution, however the manual instead offered interpretations of various reactions as likely signs of guilt. The advice included contradictory interpretations of similar reactions, without codifying or recognising this. For instance, insisting on innocence and complaining about treatment was signalled in different parts of the manual as both indicating innocence and guilt. The Guardian concluded that West Midlands Police should &quot;adopt the approach of Mersey scheme, with its emphasis on teaching the police to listen and frame questions. Research shows the biggest mistake in interrogation is the failure to listen to what is said&quot;.

There was a lax approach to the pairing of officers for interview. Officers who are less familiar with each other should be put together to reduce risks of poor or illegal practice. A number of regular pairings of interviewing officers seems to have led to collaboration in falsifying evidence.

It was West Midlands Police policy to transfer the vast majority of documents to microfiche after two years and destroy the originals. Often, the microfiche copies were unreadable. The practice also made it impossible to ascertain if statements had been interfered with through ESDA scanning and analysis.

Low level paperwork tasks were supervised by upper management, which was in general too involved in practical work including investigations, distracting from leadership, policy setting and supervision. Management focused on paper-based processes and was given little management training. Junior officers appeared to have a practical veto on new recruits.

Management practice was sufficiently poor for misleading statements to be made by the squad to external authorities. For instance, it told the Court of Appeal that officers had been disciplined after interference with witness statements, but that the changes did not include &quot;incriminating admissions&quot;, which was wholly untrue. This led to the appeals of Horobin and Wilcox being turned down in 1988.

===Confession evidence===
The SCS often relied on confession evidence to the exclusion of other kinds of evidence, despite the fact that it is inherently unreliable. Sometimes this can simply be due to the presence of authority and the expectation to confess. It can be due to stress factors in interviews. Given a certain level of stress, some interviewees will confess simply to bring the experience to a stop. A third group may come to believe in their guilt over time. Thus false confessions are not the product of coercive techniques alone, but these factors can make confessions unsound.

Kaye noted five cases where a statement with a confession was presented back to other suspects, and self-incriminating reactions were noted, although not usually signed by the suspects. This evidence was then used in their convictions. For instance, Foran was noted as saying &quot;What can I say? It&#x27;s all there isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Boswell was recorded as saying &quot;That fucking bastard, I&#x27;ll kill him ... we all agreed to make our own statements if caught and I can&#x27;t make one against my own will, can I?&quot;

Several confessions were said by police officers to have taken place in a squad car immediately after arrest. Sometimes, the suspects were taken to police stations some distance away from the arrest, in contravention of PACE regulations. Squad car interviews represent an opportunity to interview suspects without a solicitor, and make it relatively easy for officers to claim that incriminating statements were made, including through falsification of signed notes.

Signed confessions were shown from Dandy&#x27;s case onwards to have been tampered with, due to forensic ESDA evidence. However, the original statements were generally destroyed, as noted above, making it impossible to make this analysis in most cases. Instead, courts later worked on the assumption that certain officers may have tampered with signed confessions on the basis of previous behaviour, making a conviction unsafe if it relied on this evidence.

Many confessions were recorded but not admitted to by defendants. The confessional statements were generally short and undetailed, even in the course of long interviews. Kaye notes in his examination that such confessions would be unusual as most of the suspects were criminals with several confessions, so likely to be very familiar with police procedure and the effect of such convictions, if they were insisting on their innocence.

Often the phraseology of the confessions was similar and hackneyed. Kaye records that many of them were variants on:
# &#x27;That&#x27;s a bit heavy&#x27;
# &#x27;You&#x27;re spot on&#x27;
# &#x27;That bastard&#x27;s really put me in it&#x27;
# &#x27;You&#x27;re putting a good case against me&#x27;

Kaye adds that the language of the statements were generally very similar, lacking differentiation in phraseology and colloquialisms, whether from Birmingham or the Black Country, nor reflecting the diverse backgrounds of the suspects, who may have been Asian, Afro-Caribbean, from different regions of Britain or Ireland. Only in the case of Afro-Caribbeans did he note any difference, where suspects would use the word &#x27;man&#x27;, despite using the same language patterns in every other respect.

Other evidence for interference with statements comes from the length of the statements. Where the content of the statements is claimed to have been added to, these frequently show implausibly fast note taking. Kaye calculates the transcription rate as being around 30 words a minute, rather than a more typical 20–23 a minute. In John O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s case, DC Shaw was asked in court to read back his notes from an interview that was marked as having taken 15 minutes: he took 20 minutes to read them back. The case was dropped.

In order to make it hard for interviewees to be found by lawyers or relatives, police used haphazard interview locations, often to the annoyance of other police, especially as they would be implicitly tolerating the denial of suspects&#x27; rights to a solicitor. Arrests often took place very early in the morning, which is often standard police practice to ensure suspects are easily located, but would have made them disorientated at interview. Irregular, long and early hours would also have affected police performance.

===Denying suspects access to a solicitor===
Kaye&#x27;s analysis of 1980s case evidence found that no confession evidence was produced when a solicitor was present. He also found that access to solicitors was delayed in every case, except those where no request was made. It appears therefore that the standard practice was to interview suspects with the aim of gaining a confession prior to allowing them a solicitor. Nevertheless, this did not stop the confession evidence from being used in successful trials.

In some cases, suspects were forced to sign custody records stating that they had not requested a solicitor. In one case, George Lewis, the custody sheet has a line marking the paper where his hand has clearly been knocked to prevent him striking out the statement saying he had agreed not to have a solicitor present. In another case, Charles Campbell, his solicitor Mr Shipley obtained the agreement of the police that no interview was to take place without his presence, but Campbell&#x27;s confession was apparently obtained in an interview within fifteen minutes of his departure.

===Supergrass evidence===
Supergrass evidence was used to corroborate evidence from alleged confessions. It did not appear alongside other evidence, according to Kaye, so cases relied on a combination of confession and supergrass evidence.

Operation Cat, which included the conviction of Treadaway and Pendle, relied heavily on evidence from supergrass Keith Morgan. Morgan had admitted to 20 offences and was sentenced to five years in return for the evidence he presented. Morgan was not a reliable witness, however. He had also alleged that a Merseyside police officer helped him plan some robberies and demanded payment. These allegations were dismissed after an investigation. The fact of this allegation and its unreliability was not available to the defence of those he had accused.

Supergrass Albert McCabe implicated over 100 suspects from 1986, many of whom were prosecuted, but whose cases later collapsed. He was prosecuted himself for a small number of offences, admitting to nearly 70, and sentenced to six years in jail, the light sentence being part of the deal for giving evidence against others. He later wrote to the solicitors of those he had implicated to explain that his evidence was made under duress. Once convicted, he refused to make any further statements for the police.

===Violence, intimidation and torture===

Allegations were made in the early 1980s that SCS officers placed plastic bags over the heads of suspects, and covered their mouths, in order to partially suffocate them and extract a confession. Kaye notes that no allegation occurred after 1983. In Keith Twitchell&#x27;s 1980 case, he underwent a polygraph test and a &#x27;truth drug&#x27; test to try to establish that this had happened, but the evidence was deemed inadmissible by the court at the time.

In 1982–83, some of the accused in the Operation Cat convictions made the same allegation. In Derek Treadaway&#x27;s case, a Home Office pathologist gave evidence that abrasions around his mouth and bruising on his shoulders and chest were consistent with his account of being held down on a chair and &quot;plastic bagged&quot; with his mouth covered.

Allegations of violence also declined, with many fewer after 1986, according to Kaye. Explanations for the decline in violence may include that it proved counter-productive, as evidence of physical abuse could be recorded and presented in court and that psychological pressure in obtaining confessions could be just as effective.

However, there were many serious allegations of violence towards suspects in the SCS&#x27;s earlier history, the best known of which is that of the Birmingham Six. Derek Boswell made well-documented allegations in 1983, after he refused to make a statement. He claimed that an unknown officer entered his cell, beat him up and told him to make a statement. He was later visited by a doctor who recorded that he had blood stains on his T-shirt and trousers, blood clots in his nostrils and minor facial injuries, consistent with his account of being hit in the face. The officer was never identified, although Boswell gave a description of him at the time. One SCS officer was convicted in 1983 of beating up suspects on the evidence of a police cadet, who was subsequently ostracised and resigned.

As violence declined, complaints of threats increased, according to Kaye. Paul Fitzsimmons alleges that he was threatened while in prison with rearrest on release unless he supported the police&#x27;s account of solicitors asking for bribes in another case, that of Ronnie Bolden. DS McManus is alleged to have asked Fitzsimmons to claim that Bolden&#x27;s solicitors had offered him a bribe to give evidence to help Bolden.

Hassan Khan claimed that he was told during his journey back from arrest in North Wales, that he would be beaten up and treated in the same way as the Birmingham Six, and was going to meet the person who dealt with them.

Eileen McCabe, the sister of supergrass Albert, said she was told to sign a confession. Her children were brought to the police station, despite prior agreement that they were to stay with their grandmother, with the effect of making her extremely concerned about how they were being treated. She signed the confession, but it later came to light that she had difficulty reading so was unlikely to have understood its contents.

George Lewis alleged that he was threatened with a syringe, with police saying they would give him injections, which he feared, if he did not sign. A witness in the case of PC Salt&#x27;s murder also alleges that she was intimidated and shouted at while being told to implicate the others involved, while the main suspects were threatened with the murder charges if they did not confess to his robbery.

===Interference with evidence===
In some cases, the SCS was accused of fabricating forensic evidence. Ronnie Bolden alleged that police rubbed his shoes and socks on a getaway car&#x27;s carpet. In the case of Robert Burston and others, police were said to have taken bin liners with their fingerprints and placed them in a post office van. Keith Twitchell claimed his hairs were planted as evidence, although this was not used in court.

During the PCA inquiry, seven police notebooks were found to be missing, despite it being a requirement for these to be kept secure for seven years. Six arrest files out of 658 for the period 1986 – August 1989 were missing. Kaye concludes that files going missing was &quot;not uncommon&quot; at the SCS. In the case of Gall, this included witness statements from the assault victim which described their assailant as very different in appearance from Gall. This evidence did re-appear, late in the court case, but Gall was still convicted.

Michael Brommell, convicted of shotgun offences, complained about a fabricated confession. However, the interview notes had gone missing, making it impossible to identify the officers who had taken them. Nevertheless, two officers had viewed the file containing these notes the day before they went missing. The officers were suspended when the SCS was disbanded, but reinstated after it was found that there was no evidence that they had removed the notes.

Some cases relied on timing evidence which may have been altered. For instance, Michael Foran was said to have been arrested at 3.05pm, just after an accomplice had arranged to meet him at Hurst Street car park. However, Foran was logged as being in a cell by 3.12pm, a mere seven minutes later. Foran claimed to have been arrested at 2.05pm; an entry on his arrest sheet was crossed out, however the original document was destroyed so could not be examined.

Timing evidence was also important in the Birmingham Six case, where a forensic scientist Dr Frank Skuse stated he examined the suspects and found them in good health at a time that was later than the time at which they claimed had been beaten up. However, he had not taken notes, and a local chemist had been contacted by him at a time compatible with the defence&#x27;s account.

==Failed prosecutions==
===Paul Dandy===
Dandy&#x27;s case was the first where ESDA evidence showed that tampering with statements had taken place at the SCS, and opened up the possibility of others who had complained but not been believed to have their cases re-examined.

In 1987, Dandy spent 18 months in prison, awaiting trial for armed robbery. His defence presented forensic evidence from an ESDA examination showing that his statement may have been tampered with, adding a one line confession from Dandy. The case collapsed.

In 1993, Dandy was awarded £70,000 compensation for his ten-month detention on remand. The police officers concerned were disciplined internally, and a report given to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider if there was further action to take.

===Peter Gibbs, Mark Samuels and Tony Francis===
Gibbs, Samuels and Francis were arrested, accused of being involved with the death of PC Tony Salt. Salt had been on duty with PC Mark Berry on 16 April 1989 in Small Heath, supposedly watching an illegal nightclub from a flat. According to Chris Mullin, recounting the events in Parliament, Salt most likely died after a bout of heavy drinking while on duty led to his collapse. Mullin states that Berry made four statements, which gradually increased the number and involvement of one to three black men in the incident, one of whom was said to have dreadlocks.

At a press conference the day after the death, Assistant Chief Constable Meffen &quot;asserted that PC Salt had broken cover to check a suspect car and was set upon by a person or persons with martial arts skills, dragged into the alley and beaten to death&quot; although these details did not appear in any of the statements made by PC Mark Berry.

Gibbs, Samuels and Francis were arrested and interviewed. None had dreadlocks. Mullin stated:

According to Mullin, Samuels confessed to theft after being threatened with being charged with murder and Francis was told that his family would be set up on drugs charges if he did not confess to theft, while another witness was told to say she had witnessed Francis hitting Salt. After securing their confessions to theft, all three men were charged with murder.

However, the case against the three quickly unravelled. A taxi driver had witnessed Salt and Berry&#x27;s drinking bout. Salt&#x27;s wife said that she had found the cubiton that two of the suspects had confessed to stealing, and stated that Salt had taken no more than £5 that night, rather than the £30 said to have been stolen. The pathologist showed that although Salt had suffered a blow to the neck, he could not have then walked 120 feet from the party to the place where he died. Mullin related that pathologist stated that &quot;most likely explanation for his death was that, in his drunken state, Mr. Salt had fallen and hit his head on the bucket of a JCB digger parked nearby&quot;.

The charges were dropped, although this was around a year after the original events, despite the strength of the evidence that they were innocent.

Salt was included on the roll of honour of officers who fell in the line of duty by the Police Federation. His name was included on the memorial in the West Midlands Police headquarters on Colmore Row as well as the national police memorial in London.

==Overturned convictions==
Around 40 convictions failed in the 1980s, and a further 60 convictions have since been overturned. This is a summary of those cases where there has been news reporting or the judgment has been published. A near complete list can be found below.

===Birmingham Six===

The Birmingham Six, Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker, were each sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 following their false convictions for the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Their convictions were declared unjust and unsatisfactory and quashed by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991. The six men were later awarded compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.

===Derek Treadaway, Michael Dunne, Ronald, Donald, and John Brown===
Derek Treadaway, Michael Dunne, Ronald, Donald, and John Brown were arrested in &quot;Operation Cat&quot; and accused of being members of the so-called &quot;Thursday Gang&quot;, named after a series of post office robberies which were committed on Thursdays.

Treadaway was convicted in 1983 of three post office robberies committed in 1979 in Erdington and elsewhere. His conviction was overturned in 1996. He was a victim of &quot;bagging&quot;, that is use of a plastic bag to suffocate interviewee&#x27;s to extract a confession.

Treadaway alleged at a civil trial for damages:

Other evidence that was relied on at trial came from &#x27;supergrass&#x27; witnesses, whose close involvement with corrupt officers made their testimony dubious. Several of the officers involved failed to turn up to the appeal hearings.

Ronald, Donald, and John Brown, also convicted for the robberies, had their convictions overturned later, in two separate appeals.

===George Glen Lewis===
Lewis was arrested in January 1987 and subsequently convicted for two armed robberies and a burglary. His case was examined by the Yorkshire Police during their investigation.

He told the Court of Appeal that be was &quot;head-butted, punched and threatened with a syringe as he was questioned&quot;. He was forced to sign a confession and was racially abused. ESDA evidence of the impressions left by his signatures showed that it was likely that he had signed blank sheets of paper that were then used to write a statement in reverse order to that in which it was signed.

His conviction relied on the evidence of Detective Constable John Perkins and Detective Constable Peter Reynolds, who stated that Lewis confessed while they were driving to the police station after his arrest. Perkins allegedly refused to allow Lewis a solicitor, threatened him, punched him and demanded that he sign blank interview sheets.

He served five and half years in prison and was awarded £200,000 in compensation when his conviction was quashed.

===Keith Twitchell, John Lyon McCloy and Patrick Irvine===
Twitchell, McCloy and Irvine were arrested and convicted of involvement in a robbery in 1980. Twitchell claimed at trial that police had &quot;handcuffed him to the back legs of a chair he was sitting on and placed a plastic bag over his head, the material pressed to his nose and mouth.&quot;

His solicitor, Mr Solley stated at the trial that the &quot;bag was removed from his head. The procedure was repeated a number of times, until finally his resolve was totally dissolved and he agreed to sign the statement put in front of him&quot;. A policeman was alleged to have threatened that &quot;the bastard signs or he goes feet first.&quot;

Twitchell complained about being &#x27;bagged&#x27; at the time. He was denied access to a solicitor until he had signed a statement. All three had their convictions quashed.

===Tarlochan Singh Gill and three others===
Gill was convicted in 1984 of the murder of Wati Suri during a burglary. She was beaten and strangled. Three other men allegedly involved were found guilty but their convictions were quashed in 1985. Gill&#x27;s conviction however was upheld on the basis of a confession he was said to have made. He had spent ten years in jail when his conviction was quashed on the basis that his confession was extracted by Detective Sergeant James, whose evidence had been found to be unreliable in three other cases. As Gill&#x27;s conviction relied on that evidence, it was found to be unsafe and was quashed.

===John Joseph Cummiskey and Roy Meads===
Cummiskey and Meads were convicted of armed robbery of £185,000 from a postal van. They separately had their convictions quashed. Roy Meads&#x27; conviction was quashed in January 1996.

Cummiskey was jailed in 1985 and served eight years of a 15-year sentence. He asked for permission to appeal in 1987 but was refused. His second request in 1999 followed the review of other cases by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. His appeal was granted in 2003.

===David Murphy and Patrick O&#x27;Toole===
Murphy and O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s were convicted in 1978 of armed robbery at a British Leyland plant at Ward End. Murphy received eight years and O&#x27;Toole seven.

At appeal, the court noted that &quot;Murphy says he was abused and intimidated by the police and he made no confessions. O&#x27;Toole says he was beaten up by police officers, especially DS Matthews, when he refused to make a statement admitting his part in the robbery.&quot;

Their convictions were quashed in 2006, as the conviction &quot;critically depended on the evidence of police officers, notably Hornby and Matthews, whose characters have subsequently been gravely tainted, especially that of Hornby&quot;.

===Martin Foran===
Foran was convicted of four counts of robbery in 1978. He was arrested and convicted again in 1984 for a pub robbery. Both convictions were quashed, in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, reviewing the conviction for his 1984 offence, the courts found that police had ignored evidence that the &#x27;Martin&#x27; sought was a &#x27;kid&#x27; and that tampering with statements had been widespread in the squad at the time and in particular evidence handled by DI Matthews was unreliable. The defence had also been denied access to evidence that could have helped them.

==Overturned convictions at the Regional Crime Squad==
The No 4 Regional Crime Squad was a sister squad to the SCS, operating over a wider area. Many of its officers were recruited to the SCS including several who were later involved in misconduct.

===Bridgewater Four===

The Bridgewater Four were Patrick Molloy, James Robinson and cousins Michael Hickey and Vincent Hickey. On 21 February 1997, the last in a number of appeals saw the men&#x27;s convictions overturned, after the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial had been unfair, as certain areas of evidence had been fabricated by police in order to persuade the now-deceased Molloy to make a confession. However, the Appeal Judges noted that in the light of Vincent Hickey&#x27;s confessions to being present at the farm where Bridgewater was shot dead &quot;we consider that there remains evidence on which a reasonable jury properly directed could convict.&quot;

The officers involved were later employed at the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad.

<text>Wilfred Dolby Fuller VC (28 July 1893 – 22 November 1947) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Fuller was born in Greasley, Nottinghamshire. At the age of 18 (1911) he joined the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. Serving initially in a military police role at Chelsea Barracks, Wilfred, a keen sportsman volunteered for and was accepted into the battalion&#x27;s &#x27;Bomber&#x27; section. These men would advance in front of the other guards armed only with a bag of the newly invented grenades. In 1915 the battalion was deployed to France and saw action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. As a lance corporal Wilfred was in charge of a small section of bombers who on the second day of the battle (12 March 1915) advanced onto the German trench lines.

He received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 4 June 1915. In September of the same year, at the express wish of the Tsar of Russia, he was also decorated by the King at Sheffield with the Russian Cross of the Order of Saint George, 3rd Class.

==Post war==
In March 1916 he married Helena May Wheeler, a nurse at the Hammersmith Hospital from Somerset. Later the same year Corporal Fuller was discharged from the Army on medical grounds and in 1919 joined the Somerset Constabulary. He served at Milverton, Ilminster, Clevedon, Nunney and finally Frome where he performed his duties from Rodden Road police station. He retired from the police service on medical grounds in 1939 and took up residence in Frome. Wilfred and Helena had two daughters. Wilfred died aged 54 in 1947 and lies buried at ChristChurch, Frome, Somerset.

On 5 May 2017 Avon and Somerset Constabulary named their new operational training, horse and dog centre in Clevedon, Somerset, the &#x27;Wilfred Fuller VC Operational training centre&#x27;. The centre was officially opened by The Princess Royal.

<doc id="1179127" wikidata="Q861646" url="?curid=1179127" title="Kuban Cossacks">
<text>Kuban Cossacks (; ), or Kubanians (, &quot;kubantsy&quot;; , &quot;kubantsi&quot;), are Cossacks who live in the Kuban region of Russia. Most of the Kuban Cossacks are descendants of different major groups of Cossacks who were re-settled to the western Northern Caucasus in the late 18th century (estimated 230,000 to 650,000 initial migrants). The western part of the region (Taman Peninsula and adjoining region to the northeast) was settled by the Black Sea Cossack Host who were originally the Zaporozhian Cossacks of Ukraine, from 1792. The eastern and southeastern part of the host was previously administered by the Khopyour and Kuban regiments of the Caucasus Line Cossack Host and Don Cossacks, who were re-settled from the Don from 1777.

The Kuban Cossack Host (Кубанское казачье войско), the administrative and military unit composed of Kuban Cossacks, formed in 1860 and existed until 1918. During the Russian Civil War, the Kuban Cossacks proclaimed the Kuban People&#x27;s Republic, and played a key role in the southern theatre of the conflict. The Kuban Cossacks suffered heavily during the Soviet policy of decossackization between 1917 and 1933. Hence, during the Second World War, Cossacks fought both for the Red Army and against them with the German Wehrmacht. The modern Kuban Cossack Host was re-established in 1990 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

==Formation history of the Kuban Cossack Host==
Although Cossacks lived in the region prior to the late 18th century (one theory of Cossack origin traces their lineage to the ancient Kasog peoples who populated the Kuban in 9th-13th centuries), the landscape prevented permanent habitation. Modern Kuban Cossacks claim 1696 as their foundation year, when the Don Cossacks from the Khopyor took part in Peter&#x27;s Azov campaigns. Sporadic raids reached out into the land, which was partially populated by the Nogay, though territorially part of the Crimean khanate. In 1784 the lower Kuban passed to Russia, after which its colonisation became an important step in the Empire&#x27;s expansion.

===Black Sea Cossacks===

In a different part of southeastern Europe, on the middle Dnieper in what is now Ukraine, lived the Zaporozhian Cossacks. By the late 18th century, however, their combat ability was greatly reduced. With their traditional adversaries, the Crimean Khanate and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, now all but defunct, the Russian administration saw little military use for them. The Zaporozhian Sich, however, represented a safe haven for runaway serfs, where the state authority did not extend, and often took part in rebellions which were constantly breaking out in Ukraine. Another problem for the imperial Russian government was the Cossacks&#x27; resistance to colonization of lands the government considered theirs. In 1775, after numerous attacks on Serbian colonisers, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great had Grigory Potemkin destroy the Zaporozhian Host. The operation was carried out by General Pyotr Tekeli.

The Zaporozhians scattered; some (five thousand men or 30% of the host) fled to the Ottoman-controlled Danube area. Others joined the Imperial Russian Husar and Dragoon regiments, while most turned to local farming and trade.

A decade later, the Russian administration was forced to reconsider its decision, with the escalation of tension with the Ottoman Empire. In 1778 the Turkish sultan offered the exiled Zaporozhians the chance to build a new Danubian Sich. Potemkin suggested that the former commanders Antin Holovaty, Zakhary Chepiha and Sydir Bily round the former Cossacks into a &quot;Host of the loyal Zaporozhians&quot; in 1787.

The new host played a crucial role in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), and for their loyalty and service the Russian Empress rewarded them with eternal use of the Kuban, then inhabited by Nogai remnants, and in the cause of the Caucasus War a crucial progress in further pushing the Russian line into Circassia. Renamed the Black Sea Cossack Host, a total of 25,000 men made the migration in 1792-93.

===On the Russian frontier (1777–1860)===
During the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), the Don Cossacks on the Khopyor River took part in the campaign, and in 1770 – then numbering four settlements – requested to form a regiment. Owing to their service in the war, on 6 October 1774 Catherine the Great issued a manifesto granting their request.

The end of the war and the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca brought Russia&#x27;s frontiers south from the Kuban River&#x27;s entry into the Azov Sea along its right bank and right to the bend of the Terek River. This created a 500-verst undefended border, and in the summer of 1777 the Khopyor regiment – in addition to the remnants of the Volga Cossacks and a Vladimir Dragoon regiment – were re-settled in the Northern Caucasus to build the Azov-Mozdok defence line. This marked the start of the Caucasus War, which would continue for almost 90 years.

The Khopyor regiment was responsible for the western flank of the line. In 1778-1782, Khopyor Cossacks founded four stanitsas: Stavropolskaya (next to the fortress of Stavropol, established on 22 October 1777), Moskovskaya, Donskaya and Severnaya – with approximately 140 Cossack families in each. In 1779, the Khopyor regiment was given its own district. The conditions were desperate as the Circassians would mount almost daily raids on the Russian positions. In 1825-1826 the regiment began its first expansions, pushing westwards to the bend of the Kuban River and founding five new stanitsas (the so-called new-Kuban line: Barsukovskaya, Nevinnomysskaya, Belomechetskaya, Batalpashinskaya (modern Cherkessk), Bekeshevskaya and Karantynnaya (currently Suvorovskaya). In 1828 the Khopyor Cossacks participated in the conquest of Karachay and became part of the first Russian expedition to reach the summit of Elbrus in 1829.

However, the Russian position in the Caucasus was desperate, and to ease administration in 1832 military reform united ten regiments from the mouth of the Terek River all the way to the Khopyor in the western Kabarda, forming a single Caucasus Line Cossack Host. The Khopyor regiment was also given several civilian settlements, raising its manpower to 12,000. With the further advance to the Laba River the Khopyor district was split into two regiments, and Spokoynaya, Ispravnaya, Podgornaya, Udobnaya, Peredovaya, Storozhevaya formed the Laba line.

===Zaporozhets beyond the Kuban River===

Many traditions of the Zaporozhian Cossacks continued in the Black Sea Cossacks, such as the formal election of the host administration, but in some cases, new traditions replaced the old. Instead of a central Sich, a defence line was formed from the Kuban River Black Sea inlet to the Bolshaya Laba River inlet. The land north of this line was settled with villages called stanitsas. The administrative centre of Yekaterinodar (literally &quot;Catherine&#x27;s gift&quot;) was built. The Black Sea Cossacks sent men to many major campaigns at the Russian Empire&#x27;s demand, such as the suppression of the Polish Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, the ill-fated Persian Expedition of 1796 where nearly half of the Cossacks died from hunger and disease, and sent the 9th plastun (infantry) and 1st joint cavalry regiments as well as the first Leib Guards (elite) sotnia to aid the Russian Army in the Patriotic War of 1812. The new host participated in the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828) where they stormed the last remaining Ottoman bastion of the northern Black Sea coast, the fortress of Anapa, in 1828. In the course of the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856, the Cossacks foiled any attempts of allied landing on the Taman Peninsula, whilst the 2nd and 5th plastun battalions took part in the Defence of Sevastopol.

In the land they left behind, the Buh Cossacks were able to provide a strong buffer from the Danubian Sich. After the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829) most of the Danube Cossacks officially turned themselves over and under amnesty were resettled between the Mariupol and Berdyansk, forming the Azov Cossack Host.

==Expansion==
As the years went by, the Black Sea Cossacks continued its systematic penetrations into the mountainous regions of the Northern Caucasus. Taking an active part in the finale of the Russian conquest of the Northern Caucasus, they settled the regions each time these were conquered. To aid them, a total of 70 thousand additional ex-Zaporozhians from the Bug, Yekaterinoslav, and finally the Azov Cossack Host migrated there in the mid 19th century. All three of the former were necessary to be removed to vacate space for the colonisation of New Russia, and with the increasing weakness of the Ottoman Empire as well as the formation of independent buffer states in the Balkans, the need for further Cossack presence had ended. They made the migration to the Kuban in 1860. Separating the ethnic Ukrainian Black Sea Cossacks from the Caucasian mountain tribes were the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, ethnic Russian Cossacks from the Don region. Although both groups lived in the general Kuban region, they did not integrate with each other.

===Apogee of the Kuban Host===
The new Host grew to be the second largest in Russia. The Kuban Cossacks continued to make an active part in the Russian affairs of the 19th century starting from the finale of the Russian-Circassian War which ceased shortly after the hosts&#x27; formation. A small group took part in the 1873 conquest that brought the Khanate of Khiva under Russian control. Their largest military campaign was the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), on both the Balkan and the Caucasus fronts. The latter in particular was a strong contribution as the Kuban Cossacks made 90% of the Russian cavalry. Famous achievements in the numerous Battles of Shipka, the defence of Bayazet and finally, in decisive and victorious Battle of Kars where the Cossacks were the first to enter. Three Kuban Cossack regiments took part in the storming of Geok Tepe in Turkmenistan in 1881. During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the host mobilised six cavalry regiments, five plastun battalions and one battery to the distant region of Russia.

The Cossacks also carried out the second strategical objective, the colonisation of the Kuban land. In total, the host owned more than six million tithes, of which 5.7 million belonged to the stanitsas, with the remaining in the reserve or in private hands of Cossack officers and officials. Upon reaching the age of 17, a Cossack would be given between 16 and 30 tithes for cultivation and personal use. With the natural growth of the population, the average land that a Cossack owned decreased from 23 tithes in the 1860s to 7.6 in 1917. Such arrangements, however ensured that the colonisation and the cultivation would be very rational.

The military purpose of the Kuban was echoed in its administration pattern. Rather than a traditional Imperial Guberniya (governorate) with uyezds (districts), the territory was administered by the Kuban Oblast which was split into (regions, which in 1888 counted seven). Each would have its own which in turn would be split into and . The (commander) for each region was not only responsible for the military preparation of the Cossacks, but for the local administration duties. Local Stanitsa and Khutor atamans were elected, but approved by the of the . These, in turn, were appointed by the supreme of the host, who was in turn appointed directly by the Russian Emperor. Prior to 1870, this system of legislature in the Oblast remained a robust military one and all legal decisions were carried out by the and two elected judges. Afterwards, however, the system was bureaucratised and the judicial functions became independent of the .

The more liberal policy of the Kuban was directly mirrored in the living standards of the people. One of the central features of this was education. Indeed, the first schools were known to have existed since the migration of the Black Sea Cossacks, and by 1860, the host had one male high school and 30 elementary schools. In 1863, the first periodical Кубанские войсковые ведомсти (&quot;Kubanskiye voiskovye vedomsti&quot;) began printing, and two years later the host&#x27;s library was opened in Yekaterinodar. In all, by 1870, the number of schools in rural stanitsas increased to 170. Compared with the rest of the Russian Empire, by the start of the 20th century the Oblast had a very high literacy rate of 50% and each year up to 30 students from Cossack families (again a rate unmatched by any other rural province) were sent to study in the higher education establishments of Russia.

During the early twentieth century contacts between Kuban and Ukraine were established and clandestine Ukrainian organizations appeared in Kuban.

===Uniform and equipment===

Until 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a full dress uniform comprising a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding on the wide cuffs. Ornamental containers (&quot;gaziri&quot;) which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a red waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and ferrules. This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Terek Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with red cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A white metal scroll was worn on the front of the fur hat. A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Kuban Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a black waistcoat replacing the conspicuous red one and without the silver ornaments or red facings of full dress. A black felt cloak () was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.

The 200 Kuban and 200 Terek Cossacks of the Imperial Escort (&quot;Konvoi&quot;) wore a special gala uniform; including a scarlet kaftan edged with yellow braid and a white waistcoat. Officers had silver braiding on their coats and epaulettes. A dark coloured kaftan was issued for ordinary duties together with a red waistcoat.

===Russian Revolution and Civil War===

During the Russian Revolution and resulting Civil War, the Cossacks found themselves conflicted in their loyalties. In October 1917, the Kuban Soviet Republic and the Kuban Rada were formed simultaneously, with both proclaiming their right to rule the Kuban. Shortly after the Rada declared a Kuban National Republic, but this was soon dispersed by Bolshevik forces. While most Cossacks initially sided with the Rada, many joined the Bolsheviks who promised them autonomy.
In March 1918, after Lavr Kornilov&#x27;s successful offensive, the Kuban Rada placed itself under his authority. With his death in June 1918, however, a federative union was signed with the Ukrainian government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky after which many Cossacks left to return home or defected to the Bolsheviks. Additionally, there was an internal struggle among the Kuban cossacks over loyalty towards Anton Denikin&#x27;s Russian Volunteer Army and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

On 6 November 1919, Denikin&#x27;s forces surrounded the Rada, and with the help of Ataman Alexander Filimonov arrested ten of its members, including the Ukrainophile, P. Kurgansky, who was the premier of the Rada, and publicly hanged one of them for treason. Many Cossacks joined Denikin and fought in the ranks of the Volunteer Army. In December 1919, after Denikin&#x27;s defeat and as it became clear that the Bolsheviks would overrun the Kuban, some of the pro-Ukrainian groups attempted to restore the Rada and to break away from the Volunteer Army and fight the Bolsheviks in alliance with Ukraine; however, by early 1920 the Red Army took most of Kuban, and both the Rada and Denikin were ousted.

The Soviet policy of de-Cossackization repressed Cossacks and aimed to eliminate Cossack distinctness. The de-Cossackization is sometimes described as an act of genocide.

===World War II===
====Collaborators in Wehrmacht and Waffen SS====
The first collaborators were formed from Soviet Cossack POWs and deserters after the consequences of the Red Army&#x27;s early defeats in the course of Operation Barbarossa. During the Battle of the Caucasus in summer of 1942, some of the Nazi aggressors reaching Kuban were greeted as liberators. Many Soviet Kuban Cossacks chose to defect to Nazi service either when in POW camps or on active duty in the Soviet Army. For example, Major Kononov deserted on 22 August 1941 with an entire regiment and was instrumental in organizing Cossack volunteers in the Wehrmacht. Some Cossack emigres, such as Andrei Shkuro and Pyotr Krasnov chose to collaborate with the Nazis as well and stood at the helm of two Cossack divisions on Nazi service. However, most volunteers came after the Nazis reached the Cossack homelands in summer of 1942. The Cossack National Movement of Liberation was set up in hope of mobilizing opposition to the Soviet regime with an intent to rebuild an independent nationalist Cossack state.

While there were several smaller Cossack detachments in the Wehrmacht since 1941, the 1st Cossack Division made up of Don, Terek and Kuban Cossacks was formed in 1943. This division was further augmented by the 2nd Cossack Cavalry Division formed in December 1944. Both divisions participated in hostilities against Tito&#x27;s partisans in Yugoslavia. In February 1945, both Cossack Divisions were transferred into the Waffen-SS and formed the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps. At the end of the war, the Cossack collaborators retreated to Italy and surrendered to the British army, but, under the Yalta agreement, were forcibly repatriated with the rest of the collaborators to the Soviet authorities and some executed. (see Betrayal of the Cossacks) One of the Kuban leaders, the &quot;ataman&quot; Vyacheslav Naumenko served as their principle historian after World War Two, writing the first Russian language book about the Repatriation of Cossacks in his two volume work published in 1962 and 1970 entitled &quot;Velikoe Predatelstvo&quot; (&quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;).

====Red Army Cossacks====
Despite the defections that were taking place, the majority of the Cossacks remained loyal to the Red Army. In the earliest battles, particularly the encirclement of Belostok Cossack units such as the 94th Beloglisnky, 152nd Rostovsky and 48th Belorechensky regiments fought to their death.

In the opening phase of the war, during the German advance towards Moscow, Cossacks became extensively used for the raids behind enemy lines. The most famous of these took place during the Battle of Smolensk under the command of Lev Dovator, whose 3rd Cavalry Corps consisted of the 50th and 53rd Cavalry divisions from the Kuban and Terek Cossacks, which were mobilised from the Northern Caucasus. The raid, which in ten days covered 300 km, destroyed the hinterlands of the 9th German Army before successfully breaking out. Whilst units under the command of General Pavel Belov, the 2nd Cavalry Corps made from Don, Kuban and Stavropol Cossacks spearheaded the counter-attack onto the right flank of the 6th German Army delaying its advance towards Moscow.

The high professionalism that the Cossacks under Dovator and Belov (both generals would later be granted the title Hero of the Soviet Union and their units raised to a Guards (elite) status) ensured that many new units would be formed. In the end, if the Germans during the whole war only managed to form two Cossack Corps, the Red Army in 1942 already had 17. Many of the newly formed units were filled with ethnically Cossack volunteers. The Kuban Cossacks were allocated to the 10th, 12th and 13th Corps. However, the most famous Kuban Cossack unit would be the 17th Cossack Corps under the command of general .

During one particular attack, Cossacks killed up to 1,800 enemy soldiers and officers, they took 300 prisoners, seized 18 artillery pieces and 25 mortars. The 5th and 9th Romanian Cavalry divisions fled in panic, and the 198th German Infantry division, carrying large losses, hastily departed to the left bank of the river Ei.

During the opening phase of the Battle of Stalingrad, when the Germans overran the Kuban, the majority of the Cossack population, long before the Germans began their agitation with Krasnov and Shkuro, became involved in Partisan activity. Raids onto the German positions from the Caucasus mountains became commonplace. After the German defeat at Stalingrad, the 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Corps, strengthened by tanks and artillery, broke through the German lines and liberated Mineralnye Vody, and Stavropol.

For the latter part of the war, although the Cossacks did prove especially useful in reconnaissance and rear guards, the war did show that the age of horse cavalry had come to an end. The famous 4th Guards Kuban Cossacks Cavalry Corps which took part in heavy fighting in the course of the liberation of Southern Ukraine and Romania was allowed to proudly march on the Red Square in the famous Moscow Victory Parade of 1945.

==Modern Kuban Cossacks==

Following the war, the Cossack regiments, along with remaining cavalry were disbanded and removed from the Soviet armed forces as they were thought to be obsolete.

Starting in the late 1980s, there were renewed efforts to revive Cossack traditions which went to great lengths; in 1990, the Host was once again recognised by the Supreme Ataman of the All-Great Don Host (Всевеликое Войско Донское). At this time some pro-Ukrainian sentiment emerged among some Kuban Cossack leaders. For example, when in May 1993 Cossack leader Yevhen Nahai was arrested and accused of plotting a coup, another Cossack leader (kish otaman Pyuypenko) threatened to call for support for Ukraine if Nahai&#x27;s rights were violated. A march of cossack cavalry from eastern Ukraine to Kuban was met with some enthusiasm by locals.

The Cossacks have actively participated in some of the more abrupt political developments following the dissolution of the Soviet Union: invasions of South Ossetia, Crimea, Transnistria and Abkhazia and nominally as peacekeepers in Kosovo. The latter conflict was in particular special for the Kuban Cossacks, initially a number of Cossacks fled from the de-Cossackization repressions of the 1920s and assimilated with the Abkhaz people. Before the Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict there was a strong movement of creating an Abkhaz-Kuban Host among the descendants. When the civil war broke out, 1500 Kuban Cossack volunteers from Russia came to aid the Abkhaz side. One of the notable groups was the 1st sotnia under the command of Ataman Nikolay Pusko which reportedly completely destroyed a Ukrainian volunteer group fighting on the Georgian side and then went on to be the first to enter Sukhumi in 1993. Since then, a detachment of Kuban Cossacks continue to inhabit Abkhazia, and their presence continues to influence the Georgian-Russian relations.

According to human rights reports from the 1990s, the Cossacks regularly harassed non-Russians, such as Armenians and Chechens, living in southern Russia.

A contingent of Kuban Cossacks (led by Head of the All-Russian Cossack Society, Cossack General Nikolai Doluda) took part in the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade for the first time.

=== Present day military units ===
With the help of the governor of Krasnodar Krai, Aleksandr Tkachyov, the host has become an integral part of the Kuban life, there are joint combat training operations with the Russian Army, policing of the rural areas with the Police of Russia, and preparation of local youth for the one-year military conscription term. Not only is their aid in military affairs important, during the floods in 2004 of the Taman Peninsula they provided men and equipment for relief missions. Today, the host numbers 25 thousand men and has its own distinct forces: a whole regiment of the 7th &quot;Cherkassy&quot; Guards Air-Assault Division (the 108th &quot;Kuban Cossack&quot; Guards Airborne Regiment) in the Russian VDV; 205th Motorised Rifle Brigade, within the Southern Military District in the Russian Ground Forces, in addition to border guards.

On 2 August 2012, the governor of Krasnodar Krai, Alexander Tkachyov announced a controversial plan to deploy a paramilitary force of one thousand unarmed but uniformed Kuban Cossacks in the region to help police patrols. The cossacks were to be charged with preventing what he described as &quot;illegal immigration&quot; from the neighboring Caucasian republics.

The Kuban Cossacks has maintained a guard of honour since the mid 2000s. The formation of the guard of honor began in April 2006 by a group of Cossacks with the support of the Cossack chieftain, General Vladimir Gromov. On 12 June 2006, the guard performed for the first time at the Cossack monument in Krasnodar. Cossack Colonel Pyotr Petrenko has been in charge of this unit for 12 years. They wear the historical uniform of the His Majesty&#x27;s Own Cossack Escort Regiment. After an increase in personnel took place, an equestrian group was formed. The requirements for members of the guard of honor include a lack of a criminal record and being more than 180 centimeters in height.

==Culture==
Because of the unique migration pattern that the original Zaporozhian Cossacks undertook, the Kuban Cossack identity has produced one of the most distinct cultures not only amongst other Cossacks but throughout the whole Eastern Slavic identity. The proximity to the Caucasus mountains and the Circassian people influenced the dress and uniform of the Cossacks — the distinctive cherkeska overcoat and the bashlyk scarf, local dance such as the Lezginka too came into the Kuban Cossack lifestyle. At the same time, the Cossacks continued much of their Zaporozhian legacy, including a Kuban Bandura movement and the Kuban Cossack Choir which became one of the most famous in the world for their performance of Cossack and other folk songs and dances, performed in both the Russian and Ukrainian languages.

==National identity==
The concept of national and ethnic identity of the Kuban Cossacks has changed with time and has been the subject of much contention.

In the 1897 census, 47.3% of the Kuban population (including extensive 19th century non-Cossack migrants from both Ukraine and Russia) referred to their native language as Little Russian (Ukrainian), while 42.6% referred to their native language as Great Russian (Russian).

Most cultural productions in Kuban spanning 1890–1910, such as plays, stories, etc., were written and performed in the Ukrainian language, and one of the first political parties in Kuban was the Ukrainian Revolutionary Party. During World War I, Austrian officials received reports from a Ukrainian organization of the Russian Empire that 700 Kuban Cossacks in eastern Galicia had been arrested by their Russian officers for refusing to fight against Ukrainians in the Austrian army. Briefly during the Russian Civil War, the Kuban Cossack Rada declared Ukrainian to be the official language of the Kuban Cossacks, before its suppression by the Russian White leader General Denikin.

After the Bolshevik Victory in the Russian Civil War, the Kuban was viewed as one of the most hostile regions to the young Communist state. In his 1923 speech devoted to the national and ethnic issues in the party and state affairs, Joseph Stalin identified several obstacles in implementing the national programme of the party. Those were the &quot;dominant-nation chauvinism&quot;, &quot;economic and cultural inequality&quot; of the nationalities and the &quot;remnants of nationalism among a number of nations which have borne the heavy yoke of national oppression&quot;. For the Kuban, this was met with a unique approach. The victim/minority became the non-Cossack peasants who, like their counterparts in New Russia, were mixed population group, with an ethnic Ukrainian majority. To counter &quot;dominant-nation chauvinism&quot; a policy of Ukrainization/Korenization was introduced. According to the 1926 census, there were already nearly a million Ukrainians registered in the Kuban Okrug alone (or 62% of the total population)

Additionally, more than 700 schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction were opened, and the Kuban Pedagogical Institute had its own Ukrainian department. Numerous Ukrainian-language newspapers such as &quot;Chornomorets&quot; and &quot;Kubanska Zoria&quot; were published. According to historian A.L. Pawliczko, there was an attempt to have a referendum on the joining of Kuban to the Ukrainian SSR. In 1930, the Ukrainian Minister (&quot;People’s Komissar&quot;) Mykola Skrypnyk, involved in solving national issues in the Ukrainian SSR, put forward an official proposal to Joseph Stalin that the territories of Voronezh, Kursk, Chornomoriya, Azov, Kuban regions be administered by the government of the Ukrainian SSR.

By the end of 1932, the Ukrainization programme was reversed, and by the late 1930s the majority of Kuban Ukrainians identified themselves as Russians As a result, in the 1939 census, Russians in the Kuban were a majority of 2754027 or 86% The 2nd edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia explicitly named the Kuban Cossacks as Russians.

The modern Kuban vernacular known as balachka differs from contemporary literary Russian and is most similar to the dialect of Ukrainian spoken in central Ukraine near Cherkasy Some regions the vernacular includes many Northern Caucasus words and accents. The influence of Russian grammatical forms is also apparent.

Like many other Cossacks, some refuse to accept themselves as part of the standard ethnic Russian people, and claim to be a separate subgroup on par with sub-ethnicities such as the Pomors. In the 2002 Russian census the Cossacks were allowed to have distinct nationality as a separate Russian sub-ethnical group. The Kuban Cossacks living in Krasnodar Kray, Adygea, Karachayevo-Cherkessia and some regions of Stavropol Krai and Kabardino-Balkaria counted 25,000 men. However, the strict governance of the census meant that only Cossacks who are in active service were treated as such, and at the same time, 300,000 families are registered by the Kuban Cossack Host. Kuban Cossacks not politically affiliated with the Kuban Cossack Host, such as the director of the Kuban Cossack Choir Viktor Zakharchenko, have maintained at various times a pro-Ukrainian orientation.

==Organisation==
===Early 20th century===
Within the Empire, the Kuban land was administered through the Kuban Oblast with a semi-military administration. It was composed of seven subdivisions (), and numbered 1.3 million people (278 and 32 ). Kuban Cossacks formed regular units of the Imperial Russian Army as listed below. The following lists the structure prior to the outbreak of World War I, although this was re-organised during the conflict (see foot-note).

In peacetime the Host provided 10 horse regiments making up a Kuban Cossack division, six &quot;plastun&quot; (infantry) battalions and six horse-artillery batteries; in addition to irregular and support units. The &quot;first&quot; regiments were linked to the specific locales that they were recruited from, although they would often be deployed elsewhere in the Empire. In wartime, recruits were drafted from each region to form &quot;second&quot; regiments during the stage of initial mobilization. If further manpower was required, a &quot;third&quot; regiment would be formed to be dispatched as reinforcements. During World War One a total of 37 horse (cavalry) regiments were raised by the Kuban Cossack Host.

Regiments:
* 1st and 2nd Kuban Life Guard sotnias of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s personal convoy (a special unit of the Imperial Guard acting for personal protection of the monarch)
* 1st Khopyor regiment &quot;Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna&quot;
* 1st Kuban regiment &quot;General Field Marshal Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich&quot;
* 1st Zaporozhian regiment &quot;Empress Catherine the Great&quot;
* 1st Yekaterinodar regiment &quot;Kosh Ataman Chepiga&quot;
* 1st Poltavskaya regiment &quot;Yekatrinoslav Viceroy General Field Marshal Prince Potyomkin-Tavrichesky&quot;
* 1st Umanskaya regiment &quot;Brigadier Golovaty&quot;
* 1st Taman regiment &quot;General Bezkrovny&quot;
* 1st Laba regiment &quot;General Zass&quot;
* 1st Line regiment &quot;General Velyaminov&quot;
* 1st Black Sea regiment &quot;Colonel Bursak&quot;

Divisions:
* Kuban Cossack Division (after the outbreak of World War I, the Russian Army began reforming this system along modern lines, but only one division was in existence in 1914)

Plastuns:
* 1st Kuban plastun battalion &quot;General Field Marshal Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich&quot;
* 2nd through 6th Kuban plastun battalions

As noted the &quot;plastun&quot; units served as infantry. On mobilization an additional six battalions (numbered 7th through 12th) were added to the peacetime establishment, and a further two (13th and 14th) raised as reserve units. The effectiveness of these units was demonstrated during the war, particularly the Caucasus Front and by 1917 a total of 22 battalions, comprising one division plus four brigades, were on active service. A further three battalions were in reserve.

Horse artillery:
* 1st Kuban Cossack battery &quot;General Field Marshal Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich&quot;
* 2nd through 5th Kuban Cossack batteries.

In addition there four commands that were responsible for support and home front organisation in the Kuban (supplies, hospitals etc.): Ust-Labinskaya, Armavirskaya, Labinskaya and Batalpashinskaya.

From 1914 to 1917 the Kuban Cossack Host committed a total of 89 thousand men to the Russian war effort. These included 37 horse regiments, a cavalry division, 2 mounted regiments recruited from mountain peoples (Adyghe and Karachay), six &quot;convoy&quot; (Imperial Guard) escort half-sotnias, two Leib Guard HIH personal sotnias, 4 infantry plastun brigades (22 battalions), a special plastun division, nine horse artillery batteries, four reserve horse regiments and three reserve plastun battalions.

<text>Private William Edgar Holmes VC (26 June 1895 − 9 October 1918) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the Grenadier Guards during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 9 October 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive.

==Early life==
Born on 26 June 1895 in the village of Wood Stanway, in Gloucestershire, William Edgar Holmes was the son of a timber worker, Edward Holmes, who worked on the Stanway Estate, and his wife Ellen Holmes . He was educated at Church Stanway and on completing his schooling, he joined his father in working on the Stanway Estate.

In July 1913, Holmes enlisted in the Gloucestershire Regiment of the British Army. Before the year was out, he transferred to the Grenadier Guards and was posted to its 2nd Battalion.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Holmes&#x27; battalion was part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France. He saw action in the Battle of Mons and at the First Battle of Ypres. After suffering frostbite in the winter of 1914, he was medically evacuated to England for treatment; this saw two toes being amputated.

Holmes returned to his unit in 1915. As part of the Guards Division, the battalion was engaged in several battles on the Western Front, including the Battles of Loos, the Somme, Cambrai, and Arras. In the final stages of the war, it advanced against the Hindenburg Line.

On 9 October 1918, Holmes&#x27; battalion was advancing towards the villages of Cattenières and Estourmel when it was held up by machine-gun fire. While under heavy fire, Holmes retrieved two wounded men. While assisting a third wounded soldier he himself was wounded. He remained in the frontlines until he was shot in the throat and died of his wounds. Cattenières was captured the following day. For his actions of 9 October, Holmes was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Holmes&#x27; VC read: 
Holmes is buried at Carnieres Communal Cemetery Extension, a cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, in Carnieres, to the east of Cambrai.

==Victoria Cross==
King George V presented Holmes&#x27; VC to his parents on 29 March 1919, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He was also entitled to the 1914 Star with clasp, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His medals were donated to the Grenadier Guards in 1959 and are displayed at The Guards Museum, located at Wellington Barracks in London.

On 9 October 2018, the centenary of Holmes&#x27; death, the Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucester, Dame Janet Trotter, unveiled a VC Stone to honour Holmes at St George&#x27;s Church, in Didbrook, Gloucestershire. His name is recorded on the Roll of Honour inside the church.

<text>Harry Nicholls VC (21 April 1915 – 11 September 1975) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
He was born on 21 April 1915 and was 25 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of France for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 May 1940 near the River Escaut, in the village of Esquelmes north of Tournai for 6 km in Belgium, Lance-Corporal Nicholls, although suffering from shrapnel wounds in his arm, continued to lead his section in a counter-attack against overwhelming opposition. He advanced over a ridge and when the position became critical, he rushed forward, putting three enemy machine-guns out of action. He then attacked massed enemy infantry beyond a second ridge until his ammunition ran out and he was taken prisoner.

===Victoria Cross citation===

The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 31 July 1940, reading

Contrary to his citation, Nicholls was taken as a prisoner of war. He was presented with his VC ribbon by a German commandant when he was a prisoner in Poland.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Grenadier Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks in London.
