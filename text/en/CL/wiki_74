<text>In grammar, a reflexive verb is, loosely, a verb whose direct object is the same as its subject, for example, &quot;I wash myself&quot;. More generally, a reflexive verb has the same semantic agent and patient (typically represented syntactically by the subject and the direct object). For example, the English verb &quot;to perjure&quot; is reflexive, since one can only perjure &quot;oneself&quot;. In a wider sense, the term refers to any verb form whose grammatical object is a reflexive pronoun, regardless of semantics; such verbs are also more broadly referred to as pronominal verbs, especially in the grammar of the Romance languages. Other kinds of pronominal verbs are reciprocal (&quot;they killed each other&quot;), passive (&quot;it is told&quot;), subjective, and idiomatic. The presence of the reflexive pronoun changes the meaning of a verb, e.g., Spanish , .

There are languages that have explicit morphology or syntax to transform a verb into a reflexive form. In many languages, reflexive constructions are rendered by transitive verbs followed by a reflexive pronoun, as in English &quot;-self&quot; (e.g., &quot;She &quot;threw herself&quot; to the floor.&quot;). English employs reflexive derivation idiosyncratically as well, as in &quot;self-destruct&quot;.

==Indo-European languages==
Romance and Slavic languages make extensive use of reflexive verbs and reflexive forms.

In the Romance languages, there are nonemphatic clitic reflexive pronouns and emphatic ones. In Spanish, for example, the particle encliticizes to the verb&#x27;s infinitive, gerund, and imperative ( ), while in Romanian, the particle procliticizes to the verb ( ). Full reflexive pronouns or pronominal phrases are added for emphasis or disambiguation: &quot;I take care of myself&quot; ( combines with the prepositional form of the pronoun to form an intensive reflexive pronoun).

The enclitic reflexive pronoun &quot;sa&quot;/&quot;se&quot;/&quot;si&quot;/&quot;się&quot; is used in Western and South Slavic languages, while Eastern Slavic languages use the suffix -&quot;sja&quot; (-ся). There is also the non-clitic emphatic pronoun &quot;sebja&quot;/&quot;себя&quot;, used to emphasize the reflexive nature of the act; it is applicable only to &quot;true&quot; reflexive verbs, where the agent performs a (transitive) action on itself.

The Slavic languages use the same reflexive pronoun for all persons and numbers, while the Romance and North Germanic ones have a special third person pronoun that cliticizes and the other Germanic ones do as well without cliticizing. This is illustrated in the following table for the word &quot;to recall&quot; (e.g., means &quot;I recall&quot;, means &quot;You recall&quot;, and so on).

In all of these language groups, reflexive forms often present an obstacle for foreign learners (notably native speakers of English, where the feature is practically absent) due to the variety of uses. Even in languages which contain the feature, it is not always applicable to the same verbs and uses (although a common subset can be generally extracted, as outlined below). For example, the Spanish reflexive construct &quot;se hundió el barco&quot; (&quot;the boat sank&quot;) has no reflexive equivalent in some Slavic languages (which use an intransitive equivalent of &quot;sink&quot;), though for example Czech and Slovak do use a reflexive verb: &quot;loď se potopila&quot;/&quot;loď sa potopila&quot;. 
Reflexive verbs can have a variety of uses and meanings, which often escape consistent classification. Some language-common identified uses are outlined below. For example, Davies et al. identify 12 uses for Spanish reflexive constructions, while Vinogradov divides Russian reflexive verbs into as many as 16 groups.

Martin Haspelmath also has a useful distinction between the reflexive types mentioned below, which he calls introverted reflexives, and so-called extroverted reflexives, which are used for verbs that are usually not reflexive, like hate oneself, love oneself, hear oneself, and kill oneself. Some Indo-European languages have a different reflexive morpheme for extroverted reflexives. For example:
*The Russian ненавидеть себя (nenavidet&#x27; sebja) &quot;to hate oneself&quot;, which uses a reflexive pronoun, compares to мыться (myt&#x27;-sja) &quot;to wash (oneself)&quot;, which uses a reflexive suffix (Russian can also say мыть себя (myt&#x27; sebja), with a reflexive pronoun, but only when the pronoun needs to be stressed for emphasis or contrast). 
*Or Dutch &quot;zij haat zichzelf&quot; &quot;she hates herself&quot;, versus &quot;zij wast zich&quot; &quot;she washes (herself)&quot;. 
*The distinction exists similarly in English, where introverted reflexive verbs usually have no reflexive pronoun, unlike extroverted. 
*In ancient Greek, the introverted reflexive was expressed using the middle voice rather than a pronoun. Similarly, in modern Greek, it is expressed using the middle usage of the mediopassive voice. On the other hand, the extroverted reflexive was a true reflexive in ancient Greek and modern Greek. 
*Similarly, Claire Moyse-Faurie distinguishes between middle and reflexive in Oceanic languages.

===Properly reflexive===

The &quot;true&quot; (literal) reflexive denotes that the agent is simultaneously the patient. The verb is typically transitive and can be used in non-reflexive meaning as well.
===Reciprocal===

&quot;Reciprocal&quot; reflexive denotes that the agents perform the mutual actions among themselves, as in English constructions using &quot;each other&quot;. In most cases, the transitive verbs are also used.
In modern Scandinavian languages, the passive (or more properly mediopassive) voice is used for medial, especially reciprocal, constructions. Some examples from Danish are:

:&quot;Maria og Peter skændes&quot;; &quot;Mary and Peter are bickering&quot;, lit. &quot;Mary and Peter are scolded by each other.&quot;

:&quot;Maria og Peter blev forlovet&quot;; &quot;Mary and Peter got engaged [to each other].&quot;

(The hypothetical form **kysses (kiss each other) is not often—if ever—seen in Danish; however, it will likely be understood by most native speakers, indicating that the mediopassive voice is still at the very least potentially productive in Danish. An expression like &quot;de kysses uafladeligt&quot; (they kiss each other all the time) could very well be used for humorous purposes.)

===Autocausative===
&quot;Autocausative&quot; reflexive denotes that the (usually animate) &quot;referent represented by the subject combines the activity of actor and undergoes a change of state as a patient&quot;:
===Anticausative===
&quot;Anticausative&quot; reflexive denotes that the (usually inanimate) subject of the verb undergoes an action or change of state whose agent is unclear or nonexistent.

===Intransitive or impersonal===
&quot;Intransitive&quot; forms (also known as &quot;impersonal reflexive&quot; or &quot;mediopassive&quot;) are obtained by attaching the reflexive pronoun to intransitive verbs. The grammatical subject is either omitted (in pro-drop languages) or is a dummy pronoun (otherwise). Thus, those verbs are defective, as they have only the 3rd person singular (masculine or neuter, depending on language) form.

In Slavic languages, practically &quot;the only condition is that they can be construed as having a human agent. The applied human agent can be generic, or loosely specified collective or individual.&quot;

In many cases, there is a semantic overlap between impersonal/anticausative/autocausative constructs and the passive voice (also present in all Romance and Slavic languages). On one hand, impersonal reflexive constructs have a wider scope of application, as they are not limited to transitive verbs like the canonical passive voice. On the other hand, those constructs can have slight semantic difference or markedness.

===Inherent===
&quot;Inherent&quot; or &quot;pronominal&quot; (&quot;inherently&quot; or &quot;essentially&quot;) reflexive verbs lack the corresponding non-reflexive from which they can be synchronically derived. In other words, the reflexive pronoun &quot;is an inherent part of an unergative reflexive or reciprocal verb with no meaning of its own, and an obligatory part of the verb&#x27;s lexical entry&quot;:


== Hebrew ==
In Hebrew reflexive verbs are in binyan הִתְפַּעֵל. A clause whose predicate is a reflexive verb may never have an object but may have other modifiers. e.g.
* האיש התפטר מעבודתו - the man resigned from his job.
* האיש התמכר לסמים - the man got addicted to drugs.
* האיש התקלח בבוקר - the man &#x27;showered himself&#x27;, i.e., took/had a shower in the morning.
* האישה הסתפרה אצל אבי - the woman got a haircut/had her hair done at Avi&#x27;s.

=== Guugu Yimithirr ===
In Guugu Yimithirr (a member of the Pama-Nyungan language family) reflexivity can combine with past (PST), nonpast (NPST), and imperative (IMP) tense marking to form the verbal suffixes: /-dhi/ (REFL+PST), /-yi/ (REFL+NPST) and /-ya/ (REFL+IMP) respectively. See the following example where the verb &quot;waarmbal,&quot; a transitive verb meaning &#x27;send back&#x27; is detransitivized to mean &#x27;return&#x27; taking only one nominal argument with an agentive role:

The same valence-reduction process occurs for the transitive &quot;wagil&quot; &#x27;cut&#x27;

In each of these cases, the reflexively inflected verb now forms a new stem to which additional morphology may be affixed, for example &quot;waarmba-adhi&quot; &#x27;returned&#x27; may become &quot;waarmba-adhi-lmugu&quot; (return-REFL+PST-NEG) &#x27;didn&#x27;t return.&#x27; As with many Pama–Nyungan languages, however, verbs in the lexicon belong to conjugation classes, and a verbs class may restrict the ease with which it can be reflexivized. 

These reflexive morphemes are largely employed for expressing reciprocality as well; however, in cases where there is potential ambiguity between a reflexive and a reciprocal interpretation, Guugu Yimithirr has an additional means for emphasizing the reflexive (i.e., by the agent upon the agent) interpretation: namely, the &quot;/-gu/&quot; suffix upon the grammatical subject. See for example the following contrast between the reciprocal and reflexive:

==== Reciprocal ====
==== Reflexive ====
=== Gumbaynggir ===
Another Pama–Nyungan language, Gumbaynggir has a verbal suffix &quot;/-iri/&quot; to mark reciprocality and de-transitivize transitive verbs e.g.

=== Kuuk Thaayorre ===
As with Guugu Yimithirr, Kuuk Thaayorre, a Paman language, has some ambiguity between reflexive and reciprocal morphemes and constructions. Ostensibly, there are two suffixes &quot;/-e/&quot; and &quot;/-rr/&quot; for reflexivity and reciprocality respectively; however, in practice it is less clear cut. Take for example the presence of the reciprocal suffix in what should seem like a simple reflexive example.

Or the reverse wherein an apparent reciprocal assertion has reflexive morphology:

In actuality, the broader function of the reciprocal verb is to emphasize the agentivity of the grammatical subject(s), sometimes to directly counteract expectations of an external agent--as in the first example above. The combination of the reciprocal verb with the reflexive pronoun highlights the notion that the subject acted highly agentively (as in a mutual/symmetric reciprocal event) but was also the undergoer of their own action (as in a reflexive event where agentivity is backgrounded e.g. &quot;I soiled myself&quot;). 

Conversely, the reflexive verb can have precisely this function of backgrounding the agentivity of the subject and bringing the focus to the effect that was wrought upon the undergoer(s) as in the second example above.

==Uralic languages==
=== Hungarian language ===
&quot;The door opened&quot; is expressed in Hungarian as &quot;Az ajtó &quot;kinyílt&quot;&quot;, from the verb &quot;,&quot; while the passive voice is rare and archaic. There are numerous verb pairs where one element is active and the other expresses middle voice, something happening apparently on its own, rendered in English like &quot;to become, get, grow, turn&quot; (something). See also the grammatical voice of Hungarian verbs and the Wiktionary entries of &quot;, and ,&quot; three suffix groups that form such verbs.

<text> (, &quot;The Times&quot;) was one of Paris&#x27;s most important daily newspapers from 25 April 1861 to 30 November 1942. It was a serious paper of record.

Founded in 1861 by Edmund Chojecki (writing under the pen name &quot;Charles Edmond&quot;) and Auguste Nefftzer, was under Nefftzer&#x27;s direction for ten years, when took his place, and for nearly 45 years directed the newspaper with an iron hand until his death in 1914. He was succeeded by his sons Émile (1914), and Adrien Jr. (1925) and by Louis Mills (1929). Soon after Mills&#x27;s death in 1931, became a public limited company. Adrien Hébrard and his successors left substantial freedom to the editorial room and the newspaper had the reputation of keeping its journalists for a long time. always remained moderate politically.

The early issues of the newspaper reflected Nefftzer&#x27;s liberal philosophy and had considerable trouble achieving readership. He frequently had to turn to friends in Alsace who were able to help support financially. Eventually, circulation began to grow, from scarcely 3,000 in 1861, to 11,000 in 1869, 22,000 in 1880, 30,000 in 1884, 35,000 in 1904. During the interwar period, it varied between 50,000 and 80,000. Publication of the Paris edition of was suspended by the Paris Commune, and so there were no issues from 7 May to 19 May 1871. The St. Germain edition, however, ran continuously for 81 years.

Despite its comparatively modest circulation, soon became the most important newspaper of the French Republic, particularly among the French political and economic elite. The political and diplomatic information and commentaries of the paper, &quot;serious to the point of boredom&quot;, also carried considerable clout elsewhere in Europe. Journalists and correspondents included , and Adolphe Cohn in the United States.

On 28 November 1942, following the German invasion of the &quot;Zone libre&quot;, Jacques Chastenet and Émile Mireaux, the co-directors of at the time, jettisoned the newspaper. At Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s request, was founded on 19 December 1944 to replace as the newspaper of record, with the new newspaper borrowing the layout and typeface of .

<doc id="1180722" wikidata="Q7756382" url="?curid=1180722" title="The Paul O'Grady Show">
<text>The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show was a British comedy chat show presented by comedian Paul O&#x27;Grady, first shown on 11 October 2004. The programme was a teatime chat show consisting of a mixture of celebrity guests, comic stunts, musical performances, and occasionally viewer competitions.

The format was originally devised by Granada Television and was broadcast on ITV until December 2005, before moving to Channel 4 in 2006, where the show was produced by Olga TV. The show originally ended in 2009 when O&#x27;Grady announced a move back to ITV, adapting his format to prime-time for Friday nights at 9pm, hosting &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot; from 2010. However the show underperformed in the ratings, averaging just over 3 million viewers, and ended after two series in 2011 amongst reports O&#x27;Grady was &quot;keen to move on&quot;.

Three years later, the original teatime format returned to ITV on 11 November 2013, airing at its traditional time of weekdays at 5pm. It concluded its twelfth run on 13 December 2013. It returned for a thirteenth series on 28 April 2014, which ended on 30 May 2014. The programme has averaged 2 million viewers in its 5pm slot. A third and final revived series began airing on 20 April 2015 on ITV and ended on 29 May 2015.

==Format==
The show ran weekdays, Monday to Friday, for one hour from 5:00 pm. Each episode follows O&#x27;Grady being introduced, walking to his desk with one of his pet dogs; originally Buster, a Shih Tzu and Bichon Frise cross, until his death shortly before the show originally ended in 2009, and Olga, a Cairn Terrier who regularly appeared after the series returned in 2013. O&#x27;Grady read out viewers&#x27; letters, sometimes with disgust at the things viewers have sent (which included vibrating soap, a viewer&#x27;s dead goldfish wrapped in tissue and children&#x27;s letters asking if Paul wears a wig or dentures).

The remainder of the programme consists of interviews with two or more celebrity guests. Children were also featured in segments of the show such as reviewing toys, games and films, or demonstrating skills (such as speed cup stacking). The show was broadcast live from The London Studios.

==History==

===2004–05: ITV===
ITV previously had trouble filling the 5-6pm slot with a popular programme, with two daytime soap operas failing to achieve significant ratings in the slot. &quot;Night and Day&quot; launched in 2001 but moved from its teatime slot in 2002 after falling ratings. Similarly the revived version of &quot;Crossroads&quot; occupied the slot from March 2001, however it too saw a decline in ratings particularly after major cast and production changes towards the end and was axed in mid-2003. Furthermore, daytime versions of popular gameshows &quot;Catchphrase&quot; and &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; had also been tried out within teatime during 2002 but had also failed to succeed, leading to their subsequent original cancellations. &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; was seen as the saviour of this teatime slot.

ITV commissioned &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; in October 2004 following O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s appearance as a guest presenter for the (somewhat similar formatted) lunch-time entertainment show &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot;. ITV management were so impressed by his initial standing in – a replacement for regular host Des O&#x27;Connor – that he was brought back several more times, and subsequently O&#x27;Grady was given his own show (O&#x27;Grady also became good friends with co-presenter Melanie Sykes, who has since stood in for him on O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s own show on occasion).

&quot;Guess the Tune&quot; (known as &quot;The Organ Game&quot; on the Channel 4 version, and the second on ITV), a phone-in-competition where O&#x27;Grady plays tunes on his organ and the contestant has to guess them correctly to win up to £2,000, became a popular feature of the programme. The tune that O&#x27;Grady played leading into the game was a truncated version of &quot;Sing As We Go&quot;, by Gracie Fields. Also a stalwart of the show was O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Shih Tzu/Bichon Frise cross dog, Buster, who appeared for a full five minutes at the start of each programme since the ITV incarnation of the show.

===2006–09: Channel 4===
On 10 January 2006, in an unexpected announcement, O&#x27;Grady said that he had decided to leave ITV for Channel 4, following a dispute between O&#x27;Grady and Granada Television (who made &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; for ITV) after Granada &#x27;forgot&#x27; to renew O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s ITV contract. O&#x27;Grady was believed to have left ITV not only due to his contract renewal issues nor his salary, but rather he wanted more creative control over the show (Granada had promptly refused when the show was under their production). His own television production company, Olga TV (named after one of his pet dogs), subsequently took over production of the programme.

The programme began its run on Channel 4 in March 2006, in the same 5:00–6:00 pm early evening slot, alternating in this slot every three months or so with &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;. In response, initially ITV decided to air repeats of the original show in the same slot. This was partially the reason why, for its first few series on the new channel, Channel 4 billed the programme as &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.

During its time on both ITV from 2004 to 2005 and Channel 4, &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; was broadcast live on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, but Thursday&#x27;s and Friday&#x27;s episode were pre-recorded on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, respectively, at 12:30 pm.

===2013–2015: ITV revival===
After four years off-air, the show returned on 11 November 2013, in the same teatime slot from 5–6pm, on its original channel ITV, with a new theme tune written and performed by McFly. Games including &quot;Guess the Tune&quot;, also known as &quot;The Organ Game&quot;, also returned. It was a phone-in-competition where O&#x27;Grady plays tunes on his organ and the contestant has to guess them correctly, it was played live on Wednesdays show. O&#x27;Grady announced that the show would return for another series, beginning on 28 April 2014. A third and final revived series began airing on 20 April 2015.

Similarly to the Channel 4 show, &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; was broadcast live on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays at 5:00pm; Thursday&#x27;s and Friday&#x27;s episode were pre-recorded on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, respectively, at 12:30pm.

==Series overview==

===ITV (2004–05)===
The series began broadcasting on ITV on 11 October 2004. The show ran several different features, including a competition to decide the country&#x27;s best meat and potato pie, with the efforts of the Denby Dale Pie Company voted as the winner. Series two aired from 14 March to 27 May 2005 and the final original ITV series ended on 23 December that same year. Repeats of the original ITV series were shown for some time in direct competition with new episodes on Channel 4 after O&#x27;Grady left Granada.

===Channel 4 (2006–09)===
The first Channel 4 series of &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; began airing on 27 March 2006 and ran until 16 June 2006 (repeats of the show were broadcast on More4 the following lunchtime). The new show was recorded at the BBC Television Centre instead of the original home, The London Studios, due to an apparent dispute with ITV. The second series was planned to start on 4 September 2006, but was pushed back to 25 September due to O&#x27;Grady suffering a second heart attack. The second series ran until 26 January 2007.

Buster did not appear for the first two weeks due to a serious eye infection, so O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s other pet dog Olga took his place instead. On 16 January 2007, viewers noticed that instead of the scheduled live show, a repeat show was aired instead. This was due to O&#x27;Grady pulling out of the show at the last minute due to illness, later discovered as a sickness bug. O&#x27;Grady returned live the next day.

The third series on Channel 4 aired from 2 April to 15 June 2007. The show returned for the seventh series (the fourth on Channel 4) on 17 September 2007, running until December of that year. The &quot;New&quot; from the show title was dropped from this series and the show went back to its original ITV title. The show&#x27;s opening titles were retinted red, and subsequently the set backdrop was made red. The programme returned to The London Studios from BBC Television Centre.

Following news of premium rate phone in scandals, &quot;The Organ Game&quot; was suspended (as it relied on people calling in to enter the game). On the first episode of the new series (broadcast on 17 September 2007), Paul went over to play &quot;The Organ Game&quot; near the end of the show to find it tied up and him unable to use it. He invited viewers to telephone or e-mail Channel 4 bosses to allow him to play the phone-in game. On 22 October 2007, O&#x27;Grady announced on his show that &quot;The Organ Game&quot; would be returning; however there were only four special organ games leading up to Christmas, primarily for people who deserve the cash prize being offered (the phone line entries which used to be on the show have remained suspended). On 19 November 2007, the first of the four special &quot;Organ Game&quot;s aired.

The fifth series on Channel 4 began on 17 March 2008. The new series ran throughout the spring until 16 June, at which point &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; returned for its last series. The studio set was given a slight revamp with added studio lights on the floor and walls.

On 15 April 2008, Melanie Sykes hosted the show, although it was not announced that she would be hosting. Sykes informed the audience that O&#x27;Grady was ill with the flu, and as such was unable to present. Sykes hosted that week&#x27;s shows before O&#x27;Grady returned on 21 April. However, O&#x27;Grady had not fully recovered, and Sykes had to be called in to do the following show on Tuesday. It was announced that Lorraine Kelly would host Wednesday&#x27;s show, Brian Conley would host Thursday&#x27;s show, and Shane Richie would host Friday&#x27;s show. O&#x27;Grady finally returned on 28 April.

The show returned on 22 September 2008 for a new series which ended on 19 December. Brand new titles were introduced as well as a slight revamp to the set. Series 7 of the Channel 4 show began on Channel 4 on 23 February 2009 and concluded its run on 22 May. Series 8 of the Channel 4 show began on 21 September 2009. The series concluded on 18 December and was the last to air on Channel 4. During this series, it was announced that the popular pet, Buster, had retired, and on 23 November it was announced that Buster had died aged fourteen on 19 November 2009. A spokesman for the comedian confirmed the news by telling The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that O&#x27;Grady was &quot;absolutely gutted&quot;.

On 18 December 2009, O&#x27;Grady presented his final show with an array of special guests; including Beverley Callard and William Roache, Honor Blackman, Natalie Cassidy, JLS, Scott Maslen, Joe McFadden, Linda Thorson, Melanie Sykes, Catherine Tate (appearing as Joannie &quot;Nan&quot; Taylor), Kate Thornton and The Teletubbies. Plus, other celebrities including Kim Cattrall, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonas Brothers, Alan Menken and Enrique Iglesias.

O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s own daughter, her partner and his grandchildren made a special good luck VT to say goodbye to O&#x27;Grady. All of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s best bits were also shown, as was the viewers&#x27; favourite ever clip of the show.

===ITV revival (2013–2015)===
The twelfth series (fourth on ITV) began airing on 11 November 2013 on ITV. It featured a new theme tune by McFly and a new, but similar set with features from previous series. A thirteenth series (fifth on ITV) was broadcast from 28 April until 30 May 2014. A third and final revived series on ITV began airing on 20 April 2015.

==Guest hosts==
While recovering from his second heart attack, Channel 4 insisted O&#x27;Grady should take a week off from presenting the show. This break occurred from 23 to 27 October 2006 and guest presenters hosted the programme for a day each. Since then, there have been three more scheduled guest-hosted weeks and in total there have been 27 different celebrity guest hosts.

In April 2008, there were two unscheduled guest-hosted weeks. O&#x27;Grady hosted the Monday show during these two weeks, but was taken ill after contracting a flu virus for the remainder of the weeks. Melanie Sykes guest-hosted five of the eight remaining shows, having previously hosted the show three times. In total she has been guest host 11 times.

On 15 October 2009, O&#x27;Grady had to go to the dentist for some dental work, with Joe Pasquale substituting for him as host.

On 18 November 2013, O&#x27;Grady was taken ill with a suspected angina attack meaning he was unable to present the live show from that day. He was replaced by singer and entertainer Michael Ball for that episode and presenter and magician Stephen Mulhern the following day. Emma Willis hosted on 20 November, followed by Vernon Kay the next day, and finally comedian Jo Brand guest hosted on 22 November. On 25 November 2013, O&#x27;Grady returned and thanked the five stand-ins for filling in for him over the previous week. He paid particular thanks to Michael Ball who found out he was to host with only 40 minutes&#x27; notice.

===2006===

===2007===

===2008===
Note: For the episode hosted by Jackie Collins, O&#x27;Grady himself was the guest along with Paris Hilton.
===2009===

===2013===

==The Paul O&#x27;Grady Players annual pantomime==
Every year, the show had an annual Christmas pantomime. Roughly 15 guest stars appeared in the panto. There was always one narrator, who told the story throughout the panto. This had been Antony Cotton, Dawn French, Kate Thornton, Sandi Toksvig and Stephen Fry. The panto ran roughly for the whole show, with usually five minutes left at the end when O&#x27;Grady and the stars answered the questions that had been e-mailed in by the viewers. However, in the 2006 panto, Peter Pan, the panto only ran for roughly 40 minutes, ending around 5.40 pm. After this, O&#x27;Grady interviewed Dawn French, who was the narrator, as he would do on a normal show. There was then, as usual, the organ game and O&#x27;Grady and all the stars then answered e-mails sent in by the viewers. The panto was always on the last Wednesday before Christmas, meaning that it was always broadcast live.

The pantos were:
* 2005: &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;
* 2006: &quot;Peter Pan&quot;
* 2007: &quot;Cinderella&quot;
* 2008: &quot;Pinocchio&quot;
* 2009: &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (broadcast on 14 December instead of 16 December)

Jo Brand was the only celebrity who appeared in the panto every year. O&#x27;Grady thanked Brand for her appearance in every annual panto on the show after the fifth and final panto on 14 December 2009.

The pantomime did not return in the 2013 revival.

==Guest appearances==
&quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; appeared in a series 3 episode of &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;, where Tate&#x27;s character Joannie &quot;Nan&quot; Taylor made an appearance. Originally she acted very sweet, but later revealed her true colours. When O&#x27;Grady mentioned that they had replaced Joannie&#x27;s old chair with a new one and placed it in her flat, she became enraged at them for intruding her flat. Nan started swearing and walked off the set, much to the disgust of O&#x27;Grady.

The show made a brief appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;.

==Transmissions==
==Controversies==
* In light of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s love of dogs, and the fact that O&#x27;Grady rescued Buster, the show ran a &quot;Find a Dog a Home&quot; slot where abandoned dogs from various charities were featured. Viewers could then call in to request they be placed on a list to give the dog a permanent home. A direct telephone number was given to connect viewers to the appropriate charity. On moving to Channel 4, the slot remained but now viewers had to initially call a 10p-per-call information service to get the direct number of the charity. Calls dropped dramatically, and charity groups including Dogs Trust and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home told producers that they would no longer be involved with the show. The premium rate line was quickly dropped from 29 May 2006, and the original format reintroduced with the full support of the charities.

<text>Edward Bamford, (28 May 1887 – 30 September 1928) was a Royal Marines officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Bamford was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his gallantry aboard during the Battle of Jutland.

==Early life and family==
Edward Bamford was born on 28 May 1887 to the Rev. Robert Bamford and Blanch Edith Bamford (née Porter). The Rev. Robert Bamford served as curate of Lamarsh, Essex (1882–1885) and curate of Holy Trinity, Lambeth (1885–1886). In about 1892, he resigned his curacy due to ill health and settled in Sherborne, Dorset, living at Lynton House (now Abbot&#x27;s Litten) in Long Street, Sherborne. From 1895 to 1898 he served as secretary to the Yeatman Hospital, Sherborne, and died at Sherborne on 9 November 1898, aged 44, and was buried in Sherborne Cemetery. After the Rev. Bamford&#x27;s death Blanch married the Rev. Thomas Myers.

Bamford was educated at Sherborne Preparatory School, and later at Sherborne School, which he attended as a day boy from September 1900 until April 1902. His two brothers, Robert Bamford who was one of the founders of Aston Martin, and Arthur Bamford were also educated as day boys at Sherborne School. Arthur, who became a private in the Grenadier Guards, was killed near Loos on 11 October 1915 and is commemorated at St Mary&#x27;s A.D.S. Cemetery, Haisnes, and on the Sherborne School War Memorial and Sherborne School Book of Remembrance. His sister Rachel Bamford (1885–1974) was in 1911 a student at the Colonial Training College at Stoke Prior, Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and during the First World War she served in the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC).

==Military career==
In September 1905, Bamford joined the Royal Marine Light Infantry and served at various times in HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, &quot;Magnificent&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot;, &quot;Chester&quot;, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, and &quot;Highflyer&quot;.
Bamford was 30 years old, and a captain in the Royal Marine Light Infantry during the First World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

Captain Edward Bamford&#x27;s Victoria Cross citation was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, 23 July 1918: 
As with several First World War actions where so many officers and ranks distinguished themselves, such as &quot;The Six VCs Before Breakfast&quot; won by the Lancashire Fusiliers at Gallipoli, the Royal Marines Zeebrugge VCs were awarded by ballot, whereby those involved in the action voted for whom they deemed to merit the award.

Apart from the Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order, Bamford also received the Russian Order of Saint Anna, 3rd Class with Swords on 5 June 1917, the French Legion of Honour on 23 May 1919, the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, 4th Class in August 1921, the 1914/15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. He later achieved the rank of major.

==Death and legacy==
Bamford died of pneumonia on 30 September 1928 aboard HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; en route to Hong Kong, where he held the appointment of Instructor of Small Arms and Musketry Officer at Hong Kong. A 1930s photograph in the RM Museum shows a picture of his grave and headstone. All remaining cemeteries containing &quot;foreigners&quot; were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. Bubbling Well Road Cemetery is now Jing&#x27;an Park.

Memorials to Bamford are in the Depot Church in Deal and there is a Bamford House in the RM Barrack at Eastney. On 3 April 2004, the Royal Marines presented a plaque in his memory to the Officials of Zeebrugge. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, England.

An obituary for Bamford in &quot;The Shirburnian&quot;, the Sherborne School magazine, in December 1928 noted: &quot;He won his V.C. as a leader of the landing party from the Vindictive on the Zeebrugge Mole on St. George&#x27;s Day, 1918, and he will always be remembered as one of the outstanding heroes of that most gallant adventure ... In him Sherborne mourns one of her most distinguished sons.&quot;

<doc id="1180732" wikidata="Q604737" url="?curid=1180732" title="Data control language">
<text>A data control language (DCL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language used to control access to data stored in a database (authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL). Data Control Language is one of the logical group in SQL Commands. SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as insert data to a database, delete or update data in a database, or retrieve data from a database.

Though database systems use SQL, they also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. For example, Microsoft SQL server uses Transact-SQL (T-SQL), which is an extension of SQL. Similarly, Oracle uses PL-SQL, which an Oracle-specific SQL extension. However, the standard SQL commands such as &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;Insert&quot;, &quot;Update&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Create&quot;, and &quot;Drop&quot; can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.

Examples of DCL commands include the SQL commands:
* GRANT to allow specified users to perform specified tasks.
* REVOKE to remove the user accessibility to database object.

The operations for which privileges may be granted to or revoked from a user or role apply to both the Data definition language (DDL) and the Data manipulation language (DML), and may include CONNECT, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, and USAGE.

== Microsoft SQL Server ==
In Microsoft SQL Server there are four groups of SQL commands:
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)
* Data Definition Language (DDL)
* Data Control Language (DCL)
* Transaction Control Language (TCL)

DCL commands are used for access control and permission management for users in the database. With them we can easily allow or deny some actions for users on the tables or records (row level security).

DCL commands are:
;GRANT: gives specified permissions for the table (and other objects) to, or assigns a specified role with certain permissions to, specified groups or users of a database;
;REVOKE: takes away specified permissions for the table (and other objects) to, or takes away a specified role with certain permissions to, specified groups or users of a database;
;DENY: denies a specified permission to a security object.

For example: GRANT can be used to give privileges to user to do SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on a specific table or multiple tables.

The REVOKE command is used to take a privilege away (default) or revoking specific command like UPDATE or DELETE based on requirements.

=== Example ===

In the first example, GRANT gives privileges to user User1 to do SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on the table named Employees.

In the second example, REVOKE removes User1&#x27;s privileges to use the INSERT command on the table Employees.

DENY is a specific command. We can conclude that every user has a list of privilege which is denied or granted so command DENY is there to explicitly ban you some privileges on the database objects.:

== Oracle Database ==
Oracle Database divide SQL commands to different types. They are.
* Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements
* Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statements
* Transaction Control Statements
* Session Control Statements
* System Control Statement
* Embedded SQL Statements

For details refer Oracle-TCL         

Data definition language (DDL) statements let you to perform these tasks:
* Create, alter, and drop schema objects
* Grant and revoke privileges and roles
* Analyze information on a table, index, or cluster
* Establish auditing options
* Add comments to the data dictionary

So Oracle Database DDL commands include the Grant and revoke privileges which is actually part of Data control Language in Microsoft SQL server.

Syntax for grant and revoke in Oracle Database:

=== Example ===
=== Transaction Control Statements in Oracle ===
Transaction control statements manage changes made by DML statements. The transaction control statements are:
* COMMIT
* ROLLBACK
* SAVEPOINT
* SET TRANSACTION
* SET CONSTRAINT

== MySQL ==
MySQL server they divide SQL statements into different type of statement
* Data Definition Statements
* Data Manipulation Statements
* Transactional and Locking Statements
* Replication Statements
* Prepared Statements
* Compound Statement Syntax
* Database Administration Statements
* Utility Statements

For details refer MySQL Transactional statements

The grant, revoke syntax are as part of Database administration statementsàAccount Management System.

The GRANT statement enables system administrators to grant privileges and roles, which can be granted to user accounts and roles. These syntax restrictions apply:
* GRANT cannot mix granting both privileges and roles in the same statement. A given GRANT statement must grant either privileges or roles.
* The ON clause distinguishes whether the statement grants privileges or roles:
* With ON, the statement grants privileges
* Without ON, the statement grants roles.
* It is permitted to assign both privileges and roles to an account, but you must use separate GRANT statements, each with syntax appropriate to what is to be granted.

The REVOKE statement enables system administrators to revoke privileges and roles, which can be revoked from user accounts and roles.

=== Examples ===

In PostgreSQL, executing DCL is transactional, and can be rolled back.

Grant and Revoke are the SQL commands are used to control the privileges given to the users in a Databases

SQLite does not have any DCL commands as it does not have usernames or logins. Instead, SQLite depends on file-system permissions to define who can open and access a database.

<text>St James&#x27;s Cemetery is an urban park behind Liverpool Cathedral that is below ground level. Until 1825, the space was a stone quarry, and until 1936 it was used as the Liverpool city cemetery. It has been designated a Grade I Historic Park by Historic England.

==History==
The workings and operation of the cemetery predate the Cathedral to which it does not belong. The Cathedral, which began construction in 1903, occupies most of rock outcrop above the cemetery known as St James Mount (also known as Quarry Hill or Mount Zion) that in 1771 was established as Liverpool&#x27;s first public park.

The cemetery has two entrances which are always open. At the north side a stone path lined with recycled grave stones descends through a short tunnel between The Oratory and the main entrance of the cathedral. The southern entrance near Upper Parliament street is through a stone arch between the Garden Lodge and the steps up to the Mount. Notable features include the Huskisson memorial, a natural spring and a system of broad ramps lined with catacombs. There is no access from Hope Street.

==Quarry==

The original stone quarry began operation in the 16th century. The tunnel workings (most of which are blocked) probably happened in the 18th century. In 1773 the quarry workers discovered a chalybeate spring, which still flows today.

There were windmills in operation at the edge of the quarry until the 1820s.

The quarry was exhausted in 1825.

==Cemetery==

In 1826 the young architect John Foster Jr was commissioned to design and lay out a cemetery along the same lines as Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris with £20,000 raised by public subscription.

===Oratory===

On the high ground at the north, Foster built the windowless &quot;Oratory&quot; in the style of Greek Revival architecture to accommodate funeral services before burials took place in the cemetery.

The building today, which is infrequently open to the public, contains a number of the monumental statues recovered from the cemetery. A bronze sculpture by Tracey Emin stands in front of the building and is visible through the gates.

There was also a house for the minister, of which there is no trace, on the site of the cathedral.

===Garden Lodge===

To the south, Foster built a monumental arch and porter&#x27;s lodge out of the same stone. After years of being used as a property of the council for its workmen, it was refurbished into a private home in 1997.

===Burial grounds===

The cemetery was closed in 1936 after 57,774 burials and subsequently fell into a state of disrepair.

The monument above where William Huskisson is buried stands near the spring.

A Victoria Cross holder, Sergeant Arthur Herbert Lindsay Richardson (1872–1932), was buried here. He also has a memorial in the grounds of the Liverpool Cathedral.

==Park==

The project to turn the cemetery into a park was completed by 1972 after clearing the vast majority of gravestones.

<text>Predicable (Lat. praedicabilis, that which may be stated or affirmed, sometimes called &quot;quinque voces&quot; or &quot;five words&quot;) is, in scholastic logic, a term applied to a classification of the possible relations in which a predicate may stand to its subject. It is not to be confused with &#x27;praedicamenta&#x27;, the scholastics&#x27; term for Aristotle&#x27;s ten Categories.

The list given by the scholastics and generally adopted by modern logicians is based on development of the original fourfold classification given by Aristotle (Topics, a iv. 101 b 17-25): definition (&quot;horos&quot;), genus (&quot;genos&quot;), property (&quot;idioma&quot;), and accident (&quot;symbebekos&quot;). The scholastic classification, obtained from Boethius&#x27;s Latin version of Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Isagoge&quot;, modified Aristotle&#x27;s by substituting species (&quot;eidos&quot;) and difference (&quot;diaphora&quot;) for definition. Both classifications are of universals, concepts or general terms, proper names of course being excluded. There is, however, a radical difference between the two systems. The standpoint of the Aristotelian classification is the predication of one universal concerning another. The Porphyrian, by introducing species, deals with the predication of universals concerning individuals (for species is necessarily predicated of the individual), and thus created difficulties from which the Aristotelian is free (see below).

The Aristotelian treatment considered: 
* The &quot;definition&quot; of anything is the statement of its essence (Arist. τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι), i.e., that which makes it what it is: e.g., a triangle is a three-sided rectilinear figure.
* &quot;Genus&quot; is that part of the essence which is also predicable of other things different from them in kind. A triangle is a rectilinear figure; i.e., in fixing the genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which it is a &quot;species&quot;. 
* A &quot;property&quot; is an attribute which is common to all the members of a class, but is not part of its essence (i.e., need not be given in its definition). The fact that the interior angles of all triangles are equal to two right angles is not part of the definition but is universally true.
* An &quot;accident&quot; is an attribute that may or may not belong to a subject. A triangle may have &quot;accidentally&quot; one right angle but this not a mandatory feature for it.
* &quot;Differentia&quot; is that part of the essence that distinguishes one species from another. As compared with quadrilaterals, hexagons, and so on, all of which are rectilinear figures, a triangle is differentiated as having three sides. Ignoring differences, species are seen as a genus, e.g. triangles are a species of polygons.

This classification, though it is of high value in the clearing up of our conceptions of the essential contrasted with the accidental, the relation of the genus, differentia and definition and so forth, is of more significance in connection with abstract sciences, especially mathematics, than for the physical sciences. It is superior on the whole to the Porphyrian scheme, which has grave defects. As has been said, the Porphyrian scheme classifies universals as predicates of individuals and thus involves the difficulties which gave rise to the controversy between realism and nominalism. How are we to distinguish species from the genus? Napoleon was a Frenchman, a man, an animal. In the second place, how do we distinguish property and accident? Many so-called accidents are predicable necessarily of any particular persons. This difficulty gave rise to the distinction of separable and inseparable accidents, which is one of considerable difficulty.

Some Aristotelian examples may be briefly mentioned. In the true statement “Man is a rational animal,” the predicate is convertible with the subject and states its essence; therefore, “rational animal” is the definition of a man. The statements “Man is an animal” and “Man is rational,” while true, are not convertible; their predicate terms, however, are parts of the definition and hence are the genus and differentia of man. On the other hand, the statement “Man is capable of learning grammar” is true and convertible; but “capable of learning grammar” does not state the essence of man and is, therefore, a property of man. The true statement “Man is featherless” offers an example of an accident. Its predicate is not convertible with its subject, nor is it part of the definition; accordingly, it expresses only an accidental characteristic of man.

<text>or is the fourth-largest island in Norway, and the largest outside the Svalbard archipelago. The lies just off the western coast of Northern Norway. The island sits on the border of Nordland and Troms counties. The western part of the island is in the district of Vesterålen, the southwestern part is in the Lofoten district, the southeastern part is in the Ofoten district, and the northeastern part is in Troms. , Hinnøya had a population of 32,688. The only town on the island is the town of Harstad. Some of the larger villages include Borkenes, Lødingen, Sigerfjord, and Sørvik. The island is split between several municipalities: Harstad, Tjeldsund and Kvæfjord in Troms county, as well as Andøy, Hadsel, Lødingen, Sortland, and Vågan in Nordland county.

==Etymology==

The Old Norse form of the name was just &quot;Hinn&quot; (the suffix &quot;-øya&quot; meaning &quot;the island&quot; was added later). The large island is almost divided in two parts by the Gullesfjorden and Øksfjorden, and the old name is probably derived from an old verb with the meaning &quot;cleave&quot;, &quot;split&quot;, or &quot;cut&quot;.

==Transportation==
Hinnøya is connected to the mainland by the Tjeldsund Bridge across the Tjeldsundet strait. To the west, it is connected to the island of Langøya by the Sortland Bridge, and to the northwest to the island of Andøya by the Andøy Bridge. It is connected to the Lofoten islands by the Lofoten mainland connection which opened on 1 December 2007. That connection is part of the European Route E10 highway. The highway runs near Møysalen National Park. There is also a ferry connection in the southeast between the village of Lødingen and the village of Bognes on the mainland, crossing the Vestfjorden.

==Geography==

Hinnøya is dissected by several fjords, and two very long ones, Gullesfjorden in the northeast and Øksfjorden in the southwest, almost sever the island in half. There is a isthmus between innermost parts of the two fjords. Tjeldsundet sound divides Hinnøya from the mainland and from Tjeldøya; the narrow Raftsundet strait divides Hinnøya from Austvågøya and between Hinnøya and Andøya goes Risøyrenna strait. The island contains a mostly rugged and mountainous terrain, especially the southern part. There are also valleys and lakes, the largest lake is Storvatnet at 6,67 km2. The treeline lies close to 400 m above sea level, but varies from 250 m to nearly 500 m above sea level. 

The best agricultural area is in the northeast, in Harstad and Kvæfjord Municipalities. The southern part is the location of Møysalen National Park, which includes the highest mountain on the island, the tall Møysalen. In the northwestern part of the island, near the village of Forfjord, there is a nature reserve containing a valley with forests and bogs, including the oldest pine trees in Norway, more than 700 years old.

==Climate==
The climate of the southern coast of the island is warmer and wetter in winter than the northern coast. Harstad, situated on the northern part of Hinnøya, has all-time high recorded July 2014, and record low recorded in February 2010.

<text>The South Florida Railroad was a railroad from Sanford, Florida, to Tampa, Florida, becoming part of the Plant System in 1893 and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. It served as the southernmost segment of the Atlantic Coast Line&#x27;s main line. The line remains in service today and is now part of the Central Florida Rail Corridor in the Orlando metro area. The rest of the line remains under the ownership of CSX Transportation as part of their A Line.

==History==
The Lake Monroe and Orlando Railroad was organized in 1875 with a charter to build from the St. Johns River port of Sanford south to Orlando. The South Florida Railroad was incorporated on October 16, 1878, but was unable to obtain a charter until December 9, 1879, when it took over the charter of the Lake Monroe and Orlando, which was in danger of losing its land grants. The South Florida first ran on November 11, 1880, running the short distance between Sanford and Orlando. However the company had plans to continue to the Gulf of Mexico, reaching it at Tampa.
On May 4, 1883, Henry B. Plant and his Plant System (headed by the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway) bought 3/5 of the stock of the South Florida after an unsuccessful attempt to buy the Florida Southern Railway. Plant had made an agreement with the Florida Southern not to build the SF&amp;W south of Gainesville or Palatka, the northern ends of the Florida Southern, but the existing South Florida was immune from this. Plant then made agreements with all the railroads building towards Tampa except for the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. Specifically, the Florida Southern would not build any lines south of Pemberton&#x27;s Ferry and Brooksville or north of Bartow, and the South Florida would build its Pemberton Ferry Branch between the two and assign trackage rights to the Florida Southern. The agreement with the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway specified that that company would only build north of Sanford; in both cases the South Florida would give up their rights to the territories given to the other companies. The JT&amp;KW had already done some grading at Bartow and Tampa, and sold them to the South Florida.

Thus two railroads remained in a race towards Tampa - the South Florida and the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. The South Florida managed to get there first, and obtained the best ports (now known as Port Tampa). The South Florida&#x27;s original passenger depot in Tampa was located on the east side of the intersection of Ashley and Madison Streets. The Tampa end opened on December 10, 1883, and on January 25, 1884 service began over the full line, built to narrow gauge. On February 20, 1886 the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway opened to Sanford, and the South Florida was converted to standard gauge on September 22.

In 1893 the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway (Plant System) directly acquired the South Florida. Henry Plant died in 1899, which led his heirs to sell the Plant System to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast Line would then designate the South Florida Railroad main line (along with the main line of the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway and other railroads to the north) as their nearly 900-mile main line from Richmond, Virginia to Tampa.

In 1967 the Atlantic Coast Line merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (who operated the former Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, the South Florida&#x27;s former competitor), becoming the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. Seaboard Coast Line eventually became CSX in the 1980s, and the South Florida/Atlantic Coast Line main line now operates as part of one of its two main lines in the area, known as the &quot;A&quot; Line.

In 2011, CSX sold the line from Poinciana north (as well as part of the former Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway) to the Florida Department of Transportation. This state-owned segment is known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor, which includes most of the track that the SunRail commuter rail service operates on. SunRail began operation on May 1, 2014, from Sand Lake Road north to DeBary and extended service south to Poinciana on July 30, 2018. SunRail also revived passenger service to the South Florida Railroad&#x27;s historic Church Street Station in Downtown Orlando.

==Lines==
===Main Line===

When completed in 1884, the South Florida Railroad&#x27;s main line ran from Sanford southwest through Orlando and Lakeland to Tampa, terminating at Port Tampa. The main line today runs south of and roughly parallel to Interstate 4. Some of the towns along the line were named for railroad officials. Plant City was named for Henry Plant, and Haines City was named for Colonel Henry Haines, who organized the construction of the line and was considered to be Plant&#x27;s most trusted employee.

The main line remains in service and is today the southernmost segment of CSX&#x27;s A Line
* CSX (Poinciana to Port Tampa)
** Carters Subdivision (Poinciana to South Lakeland)
** Lakeland Subdivision (South Lakeland to Mango)
** Tampa Terminal Subdivision (Mango to Port Tampa)

Amtrak continues to operate passenger service on the line and uses it to reach Tampa Union Station. Amtrak&#x27;s Miami-bound trains also travel the line to Auburndale and turn south on to the Auburndale Subdivision.

Prior to the sale of the north end of the line to FDOT, the line was part of CSX&#x27;s Sanford Subdivision from Auburndale north. Since the sale, CSX only operates local freight on the Central Florida Rail Corridor. Freight service on the CFRC is based out of Taft Yard in Pine Castle, which CSX still owns. All of CSX&#x27;s through freight traffic to northern Florida now uses the adjacent S Line. The Florida Central Railroad, which connects to the Central Florida Rail Corridor in Downtown Orlando, also has freight trackage rights from its connection south to Taft Yard.

===Pemberton Ferry Branch===
Part of the agreement worked out by Henry Plant between the South Florida and the Florida Southern Railway specified that the South Florida would build the north-south Pemberton Ferry Branch. This branch began at a junction with the Florida Southern at Pemberton Ferry (known today as Croom), running south-southeast across the mainline at Lakeland to Bartow. South of Bartow, the Florida Southern continued to Punta Gorda, using trackage rights over the branch. The branch was completed in September 1884. Once the Bone Valley phosphate district was discovered near Lakeland, pressure increased to standard-gauge the line, and that was done on August 7, 1891.

After the Plant System bought the South Florida, an extension was built north from Pemberton Ferry to Inverness, where the Plant System&#x27;s Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad continued north, which was completed in 1891.

In the Atlantic Coast Line era, the north leg of the Pemberton Ferry Branch would serve as the southernmost segment of their R Line, which ran from DuPont, Georgia to Lakeland via High Springs. By the 1920s, the line was busy enough that the Atlantic Coast Line expanded the line north of Vitis Junction to double track to increase capacity.

The line is also notable for being the location of the Great Train Wreck of 1956 in Pineola (just north of Pemberton Ferry), which was head-on collision between two Atlantic Coast Line Railroad freight trains on October 18, 1956, killing five crewmen. A signpost at the site of the crash on the Withlacoochee State Trail memorializes the event.

The branch&#x27;s north leg is still in service from Lakeland to Owensboro (just southwest of Lacoochee) and the south leg is still in service from the main line to Eaton Park. The abandoned segment north of Owensboro is now part of the Withlacoochee State Trail (which also continues up the abandoned extension to Inverness). The south leg is now an industrial spur. The Fort Fraser Trail today runs along the abandoned right-of way from Eaton Park south to Bartow.

The branch is operated by CSX in the following segments:
* Wildwood Subdivision (Owensboro to Vitis Junction)
* Vitis Subdivision (Vitis Junction to Lakeland)
* CH Spur (Lakeland to Eaton Park)

===Bartow Branch===

The charter specified that the railroad must pass through Bartow; thus the Bartow Branch was built from the mainline at Lake Alfred (Bartow Junction) southwest to Bartow. It opened in 1884 and was standard gauged on September 23, 1886.

In the Atlantic Coast Line era, many of their passenger trains to Fort Myers and Naples would run on the Bartow Branch.

Part of the Bartow branch remains today from Winter Haven south to Gordonville (just northeast of Bartow). This segment is operated by the Florida Midland Railroad. The abandoned segment between Lake Alfred and Winter Haven is now the route of the Chain of Lakes Trail.

===Other Branches===
;Lake Charm
The Sanford and Indian River Railroad was chartered in 1881 to run from Sanford southeast to Oviedo and Lake Charm. The South Florida leased it in 1883, and it was standard gauged on September 21, 1886. Today, the route is still in service as CSX&#x27;s Aloma Spur from Sanford to Winter Springs. The Cross Seminole Trail runs along the former right of way from Winter Springs to Oviedo.

;Apopka
The Apopka Branch was part of the original charter, running from Mayo on the mainline west to the Withlacoochee River via Apopka. The line was never opened by the South Florida, instead partially opening as the Apopka and Atlantic Railroad. It was never a success.

;Narcoossee
The St. Cloud and Sugar Belt Railway was incorporated in 1888 to connect Kissimmee to St. Cloud and Narcoossee. It was immediately operated by the South Florida, and was merged into it in 1893. Neptune Road runs along some of the former right of way.

<text>Oklahoma Wesleyan University (OKWU) is a private university of the Wesleyan church in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, United States. OKWU offers over 30 undergraduate degrees to students at its Bartlesville campus, and it also offers six graduate degree programs as part of its online offerings.

OKWU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission while the education, business, and nursing programs are accredited through program-specific organizations. In 2022, OKWU had 902 students enrolled, with approximately 782 of those in its undergraduate programs.

==History==

Oklahoma Wesleyan University traces its history back to 1905 through several antecedent schools.

* In 1905, Rocky Mountain Missionary and Evangelistic School was founded in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Affiliated with the Pilgrim Holiness Church, the school would undergo several name changes before becoming Colorado Springs Bible College in 1950. In 1958, the school moved from Colorado to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and became Central Pilgrim College. 
* Miltonvale Wesleyan College was founded in Miltonvale, Kansas, in 1909. It was affiliated with the Wesleyan Methodist Denomination. It trained students for 63 years before merging with Bartlesville Wesleyan College in 1972.
* The Pasadena Bible Training School was founded in Pasadena, California, in 1917. In 1960, it merged with Central Pilgrim College in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
Oklahoma Wesleyan University was founded by The Wesleyan Church to provide higher education within a Christian environment for Wesleyan youth. Central Pilgrim College, its predecessor, was founded on the campus in Bartlesville, Oklahoma from a series of mergers of several schools: the Colorado Bible College (Colorado Springs, Colorado), the Pilgrim Bible College (Pasadena, California), and the Holiness Evangelistic Institute (El Monte, California). In 1958, the current day campus was purchased by Colorado Springs Bible College, which began operating as Central Pilgrim College in 1959. The campus purchase included La Quinta Mansion, the former home of oilman H.V. Foster and his family. The school changed its name to Bartlesville Wesleyan College in 1968, the same year of the merger of the Pilgrim Holiness and Wesleyan Methodist denominations to become the Wesleyan Church.In 1972, Miltonvale merged with Bartlesville Wesleyan College. That same year, BWC was accredited as a four-year, degree-granting institution.

Over the years the campus grew to include new dorm buildings, the Campbell Science Building, and the Haltom Campus Center. BWC&#x27;s first ever intercollegiate athletic team was the 1971 men&#x27;s basketball team. The campus athletic center, Mueller Sports Center, was completed in 1979. The Chapel Fine Arts Center was dedicated in 2000.

In August 2001, Bartlesville Wesleyan College became Oklahoma Wesleyan University (OKWU).
A longtime member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU), in 2015 the university withdrew from the organization. OKWU&#x27;s president cited CCCU&#x27;s &quot;reluctance to make a swift decision&quot; in response to the decisions of two member schools (Goshen College and Eastern Mennonite University) which changed their hiring policies to include same-sex couples, as an unwillingness to defend the biblical definition of marriage.

On August 15, 2016, OKWU joined a court challenge to a 2011 mandate from the U. S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights requiring colleges and universities adjudicate what they called &quot;a unconstitutional process and standard.&quot; Former president Piper stated, in part, that they &quot;refuse to accept any government intrusion that would require OKWU to teach the antithesis of our Christian beliefs concerning sexual behavior&quot; and that OKWU&#x27;s students &quot;should have the legal right to avail themselves of local law enforcement without their petition being compromised by the intrusion of an OCR-mandated committee of amateurs that contravenes the due process and confidentiality of the legal process.&quot; The suit was sponsored by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

===Presidents===
* Leo Cox (1969–1974)
* John Snook (1974–1983)
* Paul Mills (1983–2002)
* Charles Joiner (interim, 2002) 
* Everett Piper (2002–2019) 
* James A. Dunn (2019–present)

==Academics==
OKWU offers 54 majors through its five schools: its School of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Ministry &amp; Christian Thought, School of Business, School of Education and Exercise Science, and School of Nursing.

===Rankings===
In 2019, it was ranked #85 in Regional Universities West, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Athletics==
The Oklahoma Wesleyan (OKWU) athletic teams are called the Eagles. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference since the 2015–16 academic year. They are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Central Region of the Division I level. The Eagles previously competed in the defunct Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference (MCAC) from 1994–95 to 2014–15 (when the conference dissolved).

OKWU competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball (added in 2021–22), cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and eSports.

<doc id="1180758" wikidata="Q935821" url="?curid=1180758" title="Senja">
<text>or is an island in Senja Municipality in Troms county, Norway in northern Europe. With an area of , it is the second largest island in Norway (outside of the Svalbard archipelago). It has a wild, mountainous outer (western) side facing the Atlantic, and a mild and lush inner (eastern) side. The island is located entirely within Senja Municipality, which was established on 1 January 2020. The island of Senja had 7,864 inhabitants as of 1 January 2017. Most of the residents live along the eastern coast of the island, with Silsand being the largest urban area on the island. The fishing village of Gryllefjord on the west coast has a summer-only ferry connection to the nearby island of Andøya: the Andenes–Gryllefjord Ferry.

The island sits northeast of the Vesterålen archipelago, surrounded by the Norwegian Sea to the northwest, the Malangen fjord to the northeast, the Gisundet strait to the east, the Solbergfjorden to the southeast, the Vågsfjorden to the south, and the Andfjorden to the west. Ånderdalen National Park is located in the southern part of the island.

== Etymology ==
The Old Norse form of the name is believed to have been &quot;Senja&quot; or perhaps &quot;Sændja&quot;. The meaning of the name is unknown, but it might be related to the verb &quot;sundra&quot;, which means to &quot;tear&quot; or &quot;split apart&quot;, possibly because the west coast of the island is torn and split by numerous small fjords. It might also be derived from a Proto-Norse form of the word &quot;Sandijōn&quot;, meaning &quot;(area) of sand&quot; or &quot;sandy island&quot;. The Northern Sámi name is likely a loanword from Norwegian, from an earlier form * or *.

==Geography==

The island of Senja is located along the Troms county coastline with Finnsnes as the closest town, located on the mainland, just east of the island. Senja is connected to the mainland by the Gisund Bridge. Historically, Senja was divided between Lenvik Municipality (part of which is on the mainland), Berg, Torsken Municipality, and Tranøy Municipality, but on 1 January 2020, the four municipalities were merged into Senja Municipality.

The northern coasts of Senja face the open sea, the western coast faces the islands of Andøya and Krøttøya, and the southern coast faces the islands of Andørja and Dyrøya, Tromwestern coast, steep and rugged mountains rise straight from the sea, with some fishing villages (like Gryllefjord and Husøy) tucked into the small lowland areas between the mountains and the sea. The eastern and southern parts of the island are milder, with rounder mountains, forests, rivers, and agricultural land.

Senja is often referred to as &quot;Norway in miniature&quot;, as the island&#x27;s diverse scenery reflects almost the entire span of Norwegian natural geography. Senja is known domestically for its scenery and is marketed as a tourist attraction.

===Climate===
Laukhella is near Silsand on Senja island, facing the mainland towards the east. The Eastern part of Senja has an atypical boreal climate, as the wettest season is autumn and winter, and winters are also milder than typical for this climate. The western part of Senja facing the Norwegian Sea has a more subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) like the Hekkingen lighthouse.
Hekkingen island in Senja municipality is closer to the open sea, has milder winters, and has a subpolar oceanic climate like western Senja.
Older climate data from the village Gibostad on the eastern shore of the island; facing the mainland, during 1961-1990.

==Economy==
Naturally, the fishing industry is dominant on Senja, notably the &quot;Nergård Group&quot; at Senjahopen and &quot;Brødrene Karlsen&quot; at Husøy. Skaland has some graphite mining. Another important industry is ArtNord and Tromspotet at Silsand, which specializes in potato and potato products. Sollia has a stair factory and the world&#x27;s northernmost fibreglass insulation factory, Nicopan AS, which has customers throughout Norway, and exports abroad.

==Transportation==
The residents of Senja have the Gisund Bridge as a ferry-free road connection to the mainland across Gisundet to the town of Finnsnes. The town serves as a trading center for the entire Mid-Troms region, including the island of Senja. The island is also connected with the other towns in the county. At Lysnes on northern Senja is a fast boat connection with the city of Tromsø, a trip that takes about 50 minutes. From the villages of Flakstadvåg and Skrolsvik on the west and south sides of the island, there are also ferries to the town of Harstad to the south. During the summer there is a ferry between northern Senja and the island of Kvaløya, between southern Senja and Harstad, and between Gryllefjord and Andenes.

Senja has four main roads. The main road is Norwegian County Road 86 which crosses the Gisund Bridge from Finnsnes, Sørreisa, and Bardufoss. It extends across the island to Torsken and Gryllefjord. From Silsand, Norwegian County Road 861 goes north along Gisundet to Gibostad and northern Senja. Norwegian County Road 860 goes from Stonglandseidet to Silsand, Norwegian County Road 862 goes from Straumsbotn, via Senjahopen to Botnhamn.

== Governance ==

In March 2017, the Parliament of Norway voted to merge Berg, Torsken Municipality, Lenvik Municipality, and Tranøy Municipality. The new municipality was established on 1 January 2020 as Senja Municipality (). It is located in the traditional district of Hålogaland. The administrative centre of the municipality became the town of Finnsnes. The municipality includes all of the islands of Senja, the smaller surrounding islands, and part of the mainland between the Gisundet strait and the Malangen fjord.

==Attractions==
Among the sights of the island are Ånderdalen National Park, with coastal pine forests and mountains, traditional fishing communities, and previously the Senja Troll, the world&#x27;s largest troll statue (which burned down 28 March 2019). The southern part of the island is the site of a number of small museums documenting local history, notably the Halibut Museum (&quot;Kveitmuseet&quot;) in Skrolsvik.

==In popular culture==
The island of Senja is mentioned in David Armine Howarth&#x27;s World War II book, and true story, &quot;We Die Alone: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance&quot;. It has a namesake island in the MMORPG Tibia.

The Norwegian musician Moddi comes from the island and his music is said to have been influenced by its beauty.

The Norwegian musician Biosphere lives in Senja (as of 2018-19) and his 2019 album &quot;The Senja Recordings&quot;, which was recorded in Senja, refers to several places in Senja (Bergsbotn, Steinfjord, etc.).

<text>Expensive Typewriter was a pioneering text editor program that ran on the DEC PDP-1 computer, which had been delivered to MIT in the early 1960s.

==Description==
Since the program could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first word processing software. It was written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch. In the spirit of an earlier editor program, named &quot;Colossal Typewriter&quot;, it was called &quot;Expensive Typewriter&quot; because at that time the PDP-1 cost a lot of money (approximately ) as compared to a conventional manual typewriter.

<text>Thomas Barratt VC (5 May 1895 – 27 July 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Barratt was born on 5 May 1895 to James and Sarah Ann Barratt.

He was 22 years old, and a private in the 7th Battalion, The South Staffordshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when he performed the act for which he was awarded the VC and which led to his death on 27 July 1917 north of Ypres, Belgium
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England.
He was commemorated in Tipton by a block of flats being named Barratt Court. When these flats were renovated the plaque erected in his memory went missing. A replacement plaque was unveiled at a ceremony in May 2012.

<doc id="1180771" wikidata="Q1689331" url="?curid=1180771" title="Jimmy Case">
<text>James Robert Case (born 18 May 1954) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He gained national prominence with Liverpool in the 1970s and early 1980s.

==Early life==
Case was brought up in Allerton and was a distant neighbour of musician Paul McCartney on the council estate which had been built in the interwar years.

Case was also training to become an electrician, working all day but training with Liverpool two mornings and two nights a week.

==Playing career==

===Liverpool===
Case arrived at Anfield from local non-league club South Liverpool in May 1973 and was given his debut on 26 April 1975 in a league fixture at Anfield against Queens Park Rangers; goals from John Toshack (2), and Kevin Keegan made it a winning start for Case as the Reds won 3–1. By 1976 he was a first-choice midfielder who was a prolific goalscorer for someone in his position; his first goal for the club came in the 68th minute of the 3–2 league win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on 23 August 1975. At the end of his first full season, he helped Liverpool to victory in the League championship and the UEFA Cup, scoring in the first leg of the final of the latter against FC Bruges.

Case maintained his place the following year (1976–77) as Liverpool chased a unique treble of League Championship, FA Cup and European Cup. They were league champions for the second season in a row, but lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United 2–1. Case was the scorer of Liverpool&#x27;s goal shortly after their opponents had taken the lead; it was a typical Case goal, a thundering shot from outside the penalty area following a neat turn on the ball. He was in the team again a few days later when Liverpool won the 1977 European Cup Final, beating Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 in Rome.

Case won both the League (1978–79, 1979–80) and the European Cup twice more (1978 against Club Brugge in the final, 1981 against Real Madrid) with Liverpool, and added a League Cup winners&#x27; medal in 1981 (against West Ham United in the final), but in that season he found himself out of favour. Manager Bob Paisley was concerned by Case&#x27;s close friendship with fellow midfielder Ray Kennedy, with the two regularly embroiled in off-the-pitch escapades—culminating in their both being charged with assault in the spring of 1980—and with the emergence of Sammy Lee on the right side of midfield, made the difficult decision to offload Case. Paisley transferred him to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the summer of 1981.

Case is still highly thought of amongst the Anfield faithful, he was voted in at No. 45 in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop taken by the Official Liverpool Football Club web-site in which over 110,000 fans worldwide nominated their personal Top 10 players.

Case left Liverpool after a drink-induced fracas with fellow players in a North Wales hotel—which he refers to in his autobiography.

Bob Paisley thought it was time for Jimmy to move on, especially because whenever Case attended a local event, he ended up with dozens of pints on his table, bought by appreciative fans.

Paisley, in his wise way, realised that Case could eventually be brought down by his past and his south Liverpool connections. Paisley lived in Woolton, just under two miles from Jimmy&#x27;s childhood home.

On leaving Liverpool, Case went from strength to strength by not only becoming an icon at Brighton and Southampton, but also gaining recognition for his intelligent and thoughtful manner.

===Brighton===
Case joined Brighton in August 1981 as a £450,000 makeweight when Mark Lawrenson went the other way and he played a large part in the success achieved at the Goldstone Ground in the early 1980s.

With Brighton, Case scored the winning goal at Anfield in the 5th round of the 1983 FA Cup, also scoring in the quarter and semi finals as the Albion reached the final for the only time to date. The game ended 2–2 with Brighton passing up a great opportunity to win the cup when Gordon Smith hit a shot directly at United keeper Gary Bailey, who pulled off a spectacular save. Brighton&#x27;s chance of glory had gone, and they were crushed 4–0 in the replay. They had already been relegated from the First Division in bottom place. In spite of this setback, Case remained at the Goldstone Ground for nearly two years after the Seagulls were relegated, including a further FA Cup victory over Liverpool in January 1984.

===Southampton===
In March 1985, Case moved to Southampton for a nominal fee of £30,000 as Lawrie McMenemy&#x27;s last signing for The Saints, to replace Steve Williams, who had been transferred to Arsenal in December 1984. He soon won over any doubters amongst The Dell fans with some robust tackling. In his first few weeks at the club, they finished fifth in the league, but were then denied UEFA Cup qualification due to the subsequent ban on English clubs in European competitions, which followed the Heysel Disaster that year.

When McMenemy quit after the end of the season, Case was appointed club captain by new manager Chris Nicholl.

In his first full season, Saints reached the semi-final of the FA Cup (after beating Case&#x27;s former club Brighton 2–0 in the quarter-final) losing to Liverpool in an epic game at White Hart Lane on 5 April 1986, which Liverpool won 2–0 after extra time with both goals coming from Ian Rush. Victory would have made Case the first player to appear in three FA Cup finals with different clubs.

Over his six years at The Dell, Case lost none of his bite in the tackle and he made up for any loss of pace by a broadening vision and excellent passing skills. Even in his mid thirties, he was still among the most highly regarded midfielders in the First Division.

He was Saints player of the year for 1989–90 and in December 1990 was selected to represent the Football League against the Irish League. In this season Saints finished seventh in the First Division and Saints were playing at close to their best. One particularly memorable match was on 21 October 1989, when Saints defeated Liverpool 4–1, with goals from Paul Rideout, Rod Wallace (2) and Matthew Le Tissier in which Case controlled the midfield as The Saints humiliated Case&#x27;s former club. During his time at The Dell, however, he did not add any major trophies to his list of honours won at Liverpool.

Case played in midfield alongside Glenn Cockerill and Barry Horne and helped to bring on the careers of exciting young players such as Le Tissier, Alan Shearer, Rod Wallace and Jason Dodd. Ian Branfoot succeeded Nicholl as manager in June 1991, and considered that the club could dispense with Case&#x27;s services and he was transferred to AFC Bournemouth within a few days of Branfoot&#x27;s appointment, a decision that proved very unpopular with to Saints fans, especially when Case was replaced by the unsuccessful Terry Hurlock, and was one of the key reasons that Branfoot was an unpopular figure with the club&#x27;s supporters during his two and a half years in charge.

===AFC Bournemouth, Halifax Town, Wrexham &amp; Brighton again===
He moved on to join Harry Redknapp at Bournemouth and managed to play 40 league games in the 1991–92 season, and was playing in the Third Division for the first time in his whole career.

After a season at Bournemouth, he moved to Halifax Town managed by John McGrath assisted by Frank Worthington. He played there for 6 months, before moving on to Wrexham, where he helped them gain promotion from Division Three at the end of the 1992–93 season, while Halifax fell into the GM Vauxhall Conference.

He then turned out for non-league side Sittingbourne until returning to Brighton in December 1993, firstly as a player/coach before taking over from Liam Brady as manager in November 1995. He was still playing that season, and at the age of 41 was the oldest outfield player registered with any Premier League or Football League club at the time. 46-year-old goalkeeper Peter Shilton (with Coventry City and West Ham United) was the only senior player older than Case at this time, and Shilton&#x27;s failure to make any competitive appearances that campaign meant that Case was the oldest &quot;active&quot; senior player in England during the season.

He finally announced his retirement from playing on 10 November 1995.

<doc id="1180779" wikidata="Q286514" url="?curid=1180779" title="Harriet Miers">
<text>Harriet Ellan Miers (born August 10, 1945) is an American lawyer who served as White House counsel to President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007. A member of the Republican Party since 1988, she previously served as White House staff secretary from 2001 to 2003 and White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy from 2003 until 2005. In 2005, Miers was nominated by Bush to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, but—in the face of bipartisan opposition—asked Bush to withdraw her nomination a little over three weeks after it was announced. In 2007, Miers returned to private practice, becoming a partner in the litigation and public policy group at Locke Lord.

==Early life and education==
Miers was born in Dallas and spent most of her life there until she moved to Washington, D.C., (2001) to work in the Bush administration. She has described herself as a &quot;Texan through and through.&quot; She is the fourth of the five children of real estate investor Harris Wood Miers Sr., and his wife, the former Erma (Sally) Grace Richardson. Miers graduated from Hillcrest High School in Dallas in 1963.

Miers entered Southern Methodist University intending to become a teacher. The economic plight of her family was so dire that she almost dropped out in her freshman year, but she was able to find part-time work that put her through college. Then, her father had a debilitating stroke. When a lawyer helped organize her family&#x27;s financial situation, Miers was inspired to enter law school. In 1967, Miers graduated from Southern Methodist University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. In 1970, she graduated from its Dedman School of Law with a Juris Doctor degree (1970).

==Career==
In the summer of 1969, between her second and third years of law school, Miers worked as a clerk for Belli, Ashe, Ellison, Choulos &amp; Lieff, the San Francisco law firm founded by Melvin Belli. Miers was immersed in tort law. Her supervisor was Robert Lieff, then a partner in the Belli firm and later a founder of the nationally prominent plaintiffs&#x27; law firm Lieff Cabraser. In a 2005 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Lieff stated that Miers &quot;saw what we did for people who needed to get a lawyer and were only able to get a lawyer by a contingent fee.&quot;

After graduating from law school, from 1970 to 1972 Miers was a law clerk for the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Joe E. Estes. She was admitted to the State Bar of Texas in 1970 and admitted to the DC bar in 1997.

In the late 1990s, while Miers was on the advisory board for Southern Methodist University&#x27;s law school, she helped create and fund a Women&#x27;s Studies lecture series named after pioneering Texas lawyer Louise B. Raggio, who was a mentor to Miers. Raggio, who died in 2011, knew Miers for nearly 40 years, since Miers was a student at Southern Methodist University. Miers was one class behind Raggio&#x27;s son at SMU, and Raggio became a mentor for Miers; years later she served as a close advisor to Miers during the Texas Bar race. &quot;I was interested in having a woman president,&quot; Raggio says. &quot;She was an electable woman, a woman with a big firm behind her. Women&#x27;s groups supported her because they wanted to show that a woman would be a competent president.&quot;.

From 1972 until 2001 Miers worked for the Dallas law firm of Locke, Liddell &amp; Sapp (and predecessor firms before mergers). She was the first female lawyer hired by the firm and later became its president. When the merger that created Locke, Liddell &amp; Sapp took place in 1999, she became the co-managing partner of a legal business with more than 400 lawyers. In 2000 the firm settled a lawsuit for $22 million that accused the firm of having &quot;aided a client in defrauding investors&quot;. According to the &quot;Class Action Reporter&quot;, Miers &quot;said the firm denies liability in connection with its representation of Erxleben. &#x27;Obviously, we evaluated that this was the right time to settle and to resolve this matter and that it was in the best interest of the firm to do so,&#x27; Miers said.&quot;

As a commercial litigator, she represented clients including Microsoft and the Walt Disney Company.

In 1985, Miers became the first female president of the Dallas Bar Association. In 1992, Miers became the first woman to head the State Bar of Texas. From 1989 to 1998, she headed the Board of Editors for the &quot;American Bar Association Journal&quot;. From 2000 to 2001, Miers chaired the ABA&#x27;s Commission on Multi-Jurisdictional Practice.

In 1989, Miers formally registered with the Republican Party and was elected to a two-year term as an at-large member of the Dallas City Council. She did not run for reelection in 1991 after a restructure of the city council converted Miers&#x27;s at-large seat into a single-district seat.

Miers met George W. Bush in January 1989 at an annual Austin dinner affair for legislators and other important people. Nathan Hecht, a mutual friend and Miers&#x27;s date, made the introduction. Miers subsequently worked as general counsel for Bush&#x27;s transition team in 1994, when he was first elected Governor of Texas. She subsequently became Bush&#x27;s personal lawyer and worked as a lawyer in his 2000 presidential campaign.

While head of the State Bar of Texas, Miers joined an unsuccessful effort to have the American Bar Association maintain its then-official position of neutrality on abortion. The ABA had adopted abortion neutrality at its 1990 annual meeting in Chicago after strong opposition by the State Bar of Texas to a pro-choice position. By the summer of 1992, at its annual meeting in San Francisco, the issue was again pending before the ABA assembly. Miers, who had not been involved in the Chicago meeting, supported ABA abortion neutrality in San Francisco. At the San Francisco meeting, the ABA Assembly and House of Delegates voted to take a pro-choice rights position, and the state bar of Texas dropped its plans to ask the ABA&#x27;s policy-making body to hold a referendum of the group&#x27;s 370,000 members on the issue.

Since September 1994, Miers has contributed to the campaigns of various Republicans (at about the same time she began to work for George W. Bush), including Kay Bailey Hutchison, Phil Gramm, and Pete Sessions, with recorded contributions to Republican candidates and causes totaling nearly $12,000. Her earlier political history shows support for the Democrats during the 1980s, with recorded contributions to Democratic candidates and causes, including the Democratic National Committee, the Senate campaign of Lloyd Bentsen and the 1988 presidential campaign of Al Gore, totaling $3,000. Her last recorded contribution to a Democratic cause or campaign was in 1988. Ed Gillespie said that she was a &quot;conservative Democrat&quot; at the time.

In April 2007, Locke Lord Bissell &amp; Liddell announced that Miers was returning to the firm. In her new role at the firm, Miers has registered with the United States Department of Justice as an agent for the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Embassy of Pakistan.

==Government service==

In 1995, George W. Bush, then Texas governor, appointed Miers to chair the Texas Lottery Commission. Some have credited Miers with reforming the commission after a previous corruption scandal.

Her tenure has also been criticized. In 1997, the commission under Miers hired Lawrence Littwin as executive director but fired him five months later. At the time, the contract to operate the lottery was held by the politically connected GTech Corporation, which had obtained the contract with the help of a former Lieutenant Governor of Texas (Democrat Ben Barnes). Littwin, as director, began an investigation into whether GTech had made illegal campaign contributions and whether GTech owed the commission millions of dollars for breaches of its contract. He stated that Miers ordered him to stop the investigation. He brought a lawsuit alleging that he was fired in retaliation for the investigation and to ensure that GTech would keep its contract.

According to Texans for Public Justice, GTech paid Littwin $300,000 to settle the suit.

Miers resigned from the lottery commission in early 2000, a year before her term ended. She said her resignation had nothing to do with lagging sales in the system&#x27;s biggest game, Lotto Texas, but rather that she wanted to allow her successor time to prepare for rebidding the lottery&#x27;s primary operator contract.

There was some speculation during Bush&#x27;s 2000 campaign that Bush would appoint Miers to the position of Attorney General. This was seen as possible with her trusted role as Bush&#x27;s personal attorney and her many appointments during his tenure as governor. This also recalled William French Smith, who was Ronald Reagan&#x27;s personal attorney before being named Attorney General. Miers was not chosen and John Ashcroft became Attorney General instead.

In January 2001, Miers did follow Bush to Washington, D.C., serving as Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary during the first two years of his presidency. In that role, she opposed the administration&#x27;s 2001 decision to stop cooperating with the ABA rating of judicial nominees. In 2003, she was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. In November 2004, Bush named her to succeed Alberto Gonzales, his nominee for Attorney General, to the post of White House Counsel, the chief legal adviser for the Office of the President.

Miers is said to be one of Bush&#x27;s closest personal friends and appears given to effusive praise for the President. According to former Bush speechwriter David Frum, Miers has called Bush the most brilliant man she had ever met and says he was the &quot;best Governor ever.&quot; She also stated that &quot;serving President Bush and Mrs. Bush is an impossible-to-describe privilege&quot; and noted that Bush&#x27;s personal qualities &quot;make a brighter future for our nation and people all around the world possible.&quot;

Miers&#x27;s last public speech before her nomination was given to the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce on June 2, 2005.

==Supreme Court nomination and withdrawal==

On July 1, 2005, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor announced her intention to retire upon the confirmation of a successor. Bush appointed Miers as head of the search committee for candidates. On July 19, Bush nominated John Roberts to replace O&#x27;Connor. However, several weeks later, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died of thyroid cancer. Bush then withdrew Roberts from consideration as O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s replacement, instead nominating Roberts to fill the Chief Justice vacancy. The Senate confirmed Roberts on September 29.

Meanwhile, Bush considered nominating Miers as O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s successor, factoring into account bipartisan suggestions by Senators Arlen Specter and Patrick Leahy, that the nominee should come from outside the appellate court system. This caused several commentators to draw parallels with the 2000 election, when Dick Cheney, the head of Bush&#x27;s vice-presidential search committee, was ultimately selected as the running mate.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated Miers to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, saying, &quot;Harriet Miers will be the type of judge I said I would nominate: a good conservative judge.&quot; Miers&#x27;s nomination was criticized by people of various political views for the fact that she had never served as a judge at any level, her perceived lack of intellectual rigor, her close personal ties to Bush, and her lack of a clear record on issues likely to be encountered as a Supreme Court Justice. Many notable conservatives vigorously criticized her nomination, and numerous conservative groups normally considered part of Bush&#x27;s political base planned to mount an organized opposition campaign.

Miers met with the Senate Judiciary Committee after her nomination and in those meetings she was ill-prepared and uninformed on the law. Senator Tom Coburn told her privately that she &quot;flunked&quot; and &quot;[was] going to have to say something next time.&quot; Miers had difficulty expressing her views and explaining basic constitutional law concepts. Miers had no experience in constitutional law and did not have extensive litigation experience; at her Texas law firm, she had been more of a manager. In addition, Miers had rarely handled appeals and did not understand the complicated constitutional questions senators asked of her. To White House lawyers, Miers was &quot;less an attorney than a law firm manager and bar association president.&quot;

In an unprecedented move, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter and ranking Democrat Patrick Leahy also requested that Miers re-do some of her answers to the questionnaire submitted to her by the committee, noting that her responses were &quot;inadequate&quot;, &quot;insufficient&quot;, and &quot;insulting&quot; because she failed or refused to adequately answer various questions with acceptable accuracy or with sufficient detail. Miers also was claimed to have privately expressed a belief in the right to privacy to the pro-choice Arlen Specter, only to later deny that she had communicated that position. Her answers also included an error on constitutional law where she mentioned an explicit constitutional right for proportional representation; though many court rulings have found that legislative and other districts of unequal population violate the equal protection clause, the right to proportional districts is not explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution.

Overall, Miers received an unfavorable response in private meetings with senators. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback then drafted a letter asking the President&#x27;s office to turn over legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request as part of a face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators&#x27; request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch&#x27;s independence. On October 19, 2005, Specter and Leahy announced their intent to begin confirmation hearings for Miers on November 7, 2005.

Speaking with NBC News&#x27; &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on October 23, 2005, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said: &quot;...if you were to hold the vote today, she would not get a majority, either in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor.&quot; However, speaking on CBS News&#x27; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; the same day, committee chair Specter said that most senators were waiting for the hearings before making up their mind.

On October 27, 2005, Miers asked President Bush to withdraw her nomination, citing fears that the nomination would create a &quot;burden for the White House and its staff&quot;. President Bush stated that the Senate&#x27;s interest in internal White House documents &quot;would undermine a president&#x27;s ability to receive candid counsel&quot; and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her request. Miers was the first Supreme Court nominee to withdraw under duress since Douglas H. Ginsburg in 1987.

Bush then nominated Samuel Alito for the seat on October 31, 2005. The Senate subsequently confirmed Alito on January 31, 2006. Miers remained as White House Counsel for another year until announcing her resignation on January 4, 2007.

==Resignation and departure from the White House==
Joshua B. Bolten, upon becoming President Bush&#x27;s chief of staff in April 2006, pressed for Miers&#x27;s resignation, but Bush rejected the idea. After the 2006 elections, when Democrats won a majority of both chambers of Congress, Bolten asked again for her departure, arguing that the president needed an aggressive lawyer and increased staff for the Office of Legal Counsel to fend off congressional inquiries and subpoenas. The second effort succeeded; Miers announced her resignation January 4, 2007 and left January 31, 2007. In April 2007, Miers rejoined her previous firm, Locke Liddell &amp; Sapp (now Locke Lord), and became a partner in its litigation and public policy group.

==Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy==
Kyle Sampson, chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, wrote to Miers in January 2006 to recommend that the Department of Justice and the Office of the Counsel to the President work together to seek the replacement of a limited number of U.S. Attorneys, saying that limiting the number of attorneys &quot;targeted for removal and replacement&quot; would &quot;mitigat[e] the shock to the system that would result from an across-the-board firing.&quot; In March 2007 the White House had suggested that the plan came from Miers, who had left the White House in January 2007, before the dismissal received public attention. The firings have led to Congressional investigations regarding the dismissals.

On June 13, 2007, the Senate and House Judiciary Committees issued subpoenas to Miers and to Sara M. Taylor, former deputy assistant to President Bush and the White House director of political affairs, asking them to produce documents and appear before the committees to testify about what role, if any, both may have had in the U.S. Attorney firings controversy. Miers was requested to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 2007. The White House reiterated its longstanding demand that no past or present White House officials would be permitted to testify under oath before the panels, and that private interviews, not under oath, and without transcripts would be permitted. The Chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees reiterated that the White House terms were unacceptable. Ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Arlen Specter (R-PA) said that the committee had &quot;really had no response from the White House&quot; regarding possible testimony on the firing of several U.S. attorneys, and that had prompted the subpoena to compel a response. Miers refused to appear before Congress because Bush ordered her not to. On Wednesday, July 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee voted 22–17 to cite Miers for contempt of Congress for her failure to appear before the committee in response to its subpoena. On February 14, 2008, the full House of Representatives voted to cite her for contempt by a vote of 223–32. Many Republicans walked out of the chamber in protest, deriding the priorities of the speaker in calling the vote, as opposed to a vote on a surveillance bill.

On March 4, 2009, Miers and former Deputy Chief of Staff to President Bush Karl Rove agreed to testify under oath before Congress about the firings of U.S. attorneys.

==Personal life==
Miers is a close friend of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman. Texas Supreme Court Justice Nathan Hecht has known her for more than 25 years. After Miers&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, Hecht was cited as an unofficial spokesperson representing her views.

In 1979, after she made partner in her law firm, she became an evangelical Christian after a series of long discussions with Hecht, who was her colleague at the firm.

<text>Selma Fraiberg (1918–1981) was an American child psychoanalyst, author and social worker. 

At the time of her death, Selma Fraiberg was a professor of child psychoanalysis at the University of California, San Francisco and a clinician who devoted her career to helping troubled children. She was also professor emeritus of child psychoanalysis at the University of Michigan Medical School, where she had taught from 1963 to 1979, and had also been director of the Child Developmental Project in Washtenaw County, Mich., for children with emotional problems.

== Personal life ==
Selma Fraiberg was born Selma Horowitz on March 8, 1918, in Detroit, Michigan. Her mother was Dorella Horowitz and her father was Jack Horowitz. Jack Horowitz took over the family poultry business, while Dorella was a stay at home mother.
In 1945, she married Professor and author Dr. Louis Fraiberg, who she met while studying at Wayne State University. The Fraibergs had a daughter, Lisa in 1956. In 1979 the Fraibergs moved to San Francisco.

In August 1981, Fraiberg was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She died four months later on December 19, 1981, at the age of 63.

=== Academic career ===
Selma Fraiberg graduated from Wayne State University with a master&#x27;s degree in social work in 1940. She then went to the Detroit Psychoanalytic Institute to complete her psychoanalytic training. From 1963 to 1979 she was a professor of psychoanalysis at the University of Michigan. During this time she was also the director of the Child Development Project. After moving to San Francisco Selma became the director of an infant-parent program at the San Francisco General Hospital.

== Contributions ==

===Infant blindness studies===

Fraiberg&#x27;s research revolved around discovering the effects of visual deprivation in infants. Particularly, she wanted to look at the effects blindness had on ego development and organization of experience in infants. One infant that was studied by Fraiberg contributed to two new findings. The infant, Toni, was considered normal blind, as defined by Fraiberg. Prior to these findings it had been believed that an infant smiling response would only result from visual stimulus of a human. However, this was overturned when Toni would smile after hearing her mother&#x27;s voice. A second new finding was related to stranger anxiety, which had been thought to only be an effect of a visual distinction between a known face and an unknown face. This was also questioned when Toni would not smile in response to hearing a voice of anyone except her mother around the age of eight months old.

Fraiberg also distinguished the importance of a blind infant&#x27;s mouth as a replacement to their deficiency in visual stimulus. She noted that blind infants use their mouth as a way to perceive the world much longer than non-blind infants. Tactile perception is important to developing the difference between the inner and outer self. Since blind infants lack visual perceptions, they rely on their mouth for perceiving the world well into their second year of life. This results in failure of differentiating between the self and non-self in blind infants at a normal age.

===Mental health treatment for children===

Fraiberg was a part of developing new techniques for mental health treatment of young children. One technique she proposed was called &quot;kitchen table therapy, by which she would go into the homes of parents with young children, typically under the age of two. There are three different approaches to kitchen table therapy: brief crisis intervention, developmental guidance-support treatment, and infant-parent psychotherapy. Each type of therapy is used for different situations, depending on where Fraiberg or her colleagues thought the problems in the parent/child development relationship were stemming from. Brief crisis intervention was used when there was few, specific, situational events that resulted in a lack of helping the child develop. Developmental guidance-support treatment is used in situations where the baby may have a chronic illness or disorder and the parents are struggling to find a way to move beyond that problem. This therapy technique is used when parents are still capable of being good parents, but simply need assistance in how to practice that. Infant-parent psychotherapy is used when the parents have their own struggles from their past which prevent them from developing an attachment with their child. The main goal of this technique is to rid the parents of their problem so it does not transfer onto the child. The purpose of these three types of therapy is to prevent development and attachment delays in children. These therapy techniques combine psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and social work practices to help parents and children establish foundations for development and attachment in the child&#x27;s first few years of life.

===Evocative memory===
Fraiberg coined the phrase evocative memory to describe the phenomenon of remembering a person without needing a tangible object to refresh one’s memory, and asserted that this form of memory starts in children at about the age of eighteen months. She suggested, “following Piaget, that a distinction between &quot;recognition memory&quot; and &quot;evocative memory&quot; may clarify usage in psychoanalytic studies.”

==Psychoanalysis==

Fraiberg&#x27;s work is said to have paralleled that of Anna Freud, a pioneer in child psychoanalysis. Both were keenly interested in young blind people. For 15 years Professor Fraiberg studied the development of children who were blind from birth, and this led to her writing &quot;Insights From the Blind: Comparative Studies of Blind and Sighted Infants,&quot; published in 1977. In the same year, she wrote &quot;Every Child&#x27;s Birthright: In Defense of Mothering,&quot; a study of the early mother-child relationship in which she argued that all subsequent development is based on the quality of the child&#x27;s first attachments.

She studied infants with congenital blindness in the 1970s. She found that blind babies had three problems to overcome: learning to recognize parents from sound alone, learning about permanence of objects, acquiring a typical or healthy self-image. She also found that vision acts as a way of pulling other sensory modalities together and without sight babies are delayed. In addition to her work with blind babies, she also was one of the founders of the field of infant mental health and developed mental health treatment approaches for infants, toddlers and their families. Her work on intergenerational transmission of trauma such as described in her landmark paper entitled &quot;Ghosts in the Nursery&quot; has had an important influence on the work of living psychoanalysts and clinical researchers such as Alicia Lieberman and Daniel Schechter Her seminal contribution to childhood development, &quot;The Magic Years&quot;, is still in use by students of childhood development and early childhood education throughout the United States. &quot;The Magic Years,&quot; which deals with early childhood and has been translated into 11 languages, was written when she was teaching at the Tulane Medical School in New Orleans.

She was the author of several influential psychoanalytic texts such as: &quot;The Magic Years&quot; and Clinical Studies in &quot;Infant Mental Health&quot;

==Legacy==

Fraiberg developed a new technique to approach infant and parent treatment. This approach for developing infant relationships with their parents until the age of two brought the treatment into the home and is still used today. Her practice was the start of infant mental health development and is still being used today, only with small adjustments and modifications to account for changing urban and rural lifestyles. Fraiberg&#x27;s new approach to infant mental health was different than current approaches of her time. However, they continue to be the building blocks of infant mental health today.

Fraiberg&#x27;s concept of &quot;ghosts&quot; in her infant mental health studies is still prominent in infant theories and studies today. In her paper &quot;Ghosts in the Nursery,&quot; Fraiberg said problems in infant development and attachment stem from the ghosts of their parents. The unremembered ghosts prevent parents from fully developing a deep attachment with their child that is important to their development. This concept of ghosts is used as a function of psychotherapy. The function is helping the subject leave their ghosts behind and continue moving forward with their life.

<text>The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe () is a four-volume work by the architect Christopher Alexander published in 2002–2004. In his earlier work, Alexander attempted to formulate the principles that lead to a good built environment as patterns, or recurring design solutions. However, he came to believe that patterns themselves are not enough to generate life in buildings and cities, and that one needs a &quot;morphogenetic&quot; understanding of the formation of the built environment as well as a deep understanding of how the makers get in touch with the creative process.

==&quot;The Phenomenon of Life&quot;==
Volume 1 attempts to define &quot;life&quot; in the built environment and determine why one built environment may have more life than another. Important to this idea is his notion of &quot;centers&quot;:

:&quot;Centers are those particular identified sets, or systems, which appear within the larger whole as distinct and noticeable parts. They appear because they have noticeable distinctness, which makes them separate out from their surroundings and makes them cohere, and it is from the arrangements of these coherent parts that other coherent parts appear. The life or intensity of one center is increased or decreased according to the position and intensity of other nearby centers. Above all, centers become most intense when the centers which they are made of help each other.&quot;

Alexander argues that any entity (center) for example an ecosystem, landscape, garden, city, street, building, window, painting, animal or human being has a certain degree of life. According to Alexander, a human being is able to sense this degree of life in an entity objectively, as a real empirical dimension. He tries to demonstrate this to the reader with experiments that he has conducted, studies and experiments the reader can do. The ability to be aware of the degree of life of an entity, lays out the foundation for his theory and for the creative process of which human beings are, according to Alexander, capable.

The first volume contains an exposition of what the author calls the fundamental properties, which are those that are possessed by environments which have more life. He argues that processes that lead to a good built environment are those that tend to increase one or more of these properties. He identifies fifteen geometric properties which tend to accompany the presence of life in nature, and also in the buildings and cities we make. These properties are seen over and over in nature, and in cities and streets of the past, but have all but disappeared in the developments and buildings of the last one hundred years. The book shows that living structure depends on features which make a close connection with the human self, and that living structure has the capacity to support human well-being.

==&quot;The Process of Creating Life&quot;==
The second book describes the process of creating &quot;life&quot;, which is an evolutionary process. Complex systems do not spring into existence fully formed, but rather through a series of small, incremental changes. The process begins with a simple system and incrementally changes that system such that each change preserves the structure of the previous step. Alexander calls these increments &quot;structure-preserving transformations,&quot; and they are essential to his process.

Where book one introduces the reader to 15 geometric properties that make up living systems, Alexander reframes those geometric properties as structure-preserving transformations in and of themselves rather than being the results of other transformations. For example, Alexander claims that &quot;Levels of Scale&quot; will arise naturally as a result of structure-preserving transformations, but he notes that &quot;Levels of Scale&quot; can also be viewed as a transformation that introduces level of scale into a given structure. A skilled designer would use this transformation to add depth to a particular part of the system that was being built.

Alexander contrasts structure-preserving transformations with &quot;Structure-destroying transformations&quot;, which he feels are common in modern architecture. Alexander himself does express some sympathy for those who have used these processes to design buildings that he feels are devoid of &quot;life&quot;: 
:&quot;I do not, directly, blame all the architects who have made these buildings in so many places on earth. I believe it is inappropriate to feel anger towards them... Rather, I believe that we must acknowledge that the architects (often our own colleagues) who drew these buildings, and then had them built by methods and processes far from their control, deserve our sympathy for being placed in an impossible position. What has caused the new tradition of structure-destroying forms of this era, are mainly the machine-like processes of planning, conceiving, budgeting, developing, construction contracting, construction labor, and so forth. The architects who fully accepted the modern machine have hardly been more than pawns in the game which is much larger than they are.&quot;

==&quot;A Vision of a Living World&quot;==
Volume 3, the last of the four books to be published, is the least theoretical of the books and the most compelling from a practical point of view. In Book 3 Alexander presents hundreds of his own buildings and those of his contemporaries who have used similar methods consistent with the theory of living process. The projects include neighborhoods, housing built by people for themselves, public buildings, public urban space, ornament, colors, and details of construction innovation. Hundreds of color photographs offer concrete examples of the kind of spaces, things and buildings you can achieve when you put Alexander&#x27;s theories into practice.

These photos of buildings, and the discussion of each, demonstrate exactly what Alexander means when he talks about living structure, and using life-creating processes to create beautiful places and buildings. These places are more than just pleasant to look at, and be in—they reach an archetypal level of human experience, reaching across centuries, across continents, across cultures, across technology, across building materials and climates. They connect to us all. They connect us to our own feelings.

All four books of &quot;The Nature of Order&quot; present a new framework for perceiving and interacting with our world, a methodology for creating beautiful spaces, a cosmology where art, architecture, science, religion and secular life all work comfortably together. The third book shows us—visually, technically, and artistically—what a world built in this cosmology and framework is likely to be like for us. Six hundred pages of projects built and planned over a thirty-year period, including many un-built experiments, illustrate the impact which is likely to follow from the use of living process in the world. The book provides the reader with an intuitive feel for the kind of world, its style and geometry, which is likely to follow, together with its ecological and natural character. It closes with an assessment of the archetypal character such a new, living world, is likely to reveal.

With these examples, lay people, architects, builders, scientists, artists, and students are able to make this new framework real for themselves, for their own lives, and for their own work. Alexander gives us a feast for the eyes, the mind, and the heart.

==&quot;The Luminous Ground&quot;==
The foundations of modern scientific thought, four centuries old, are firmly rooted in a conception that the universe is a machinelike entity, a play of baubles, machines, trinkets. To this day, our real daily experience of ourselves has no clear place in science. It is little wonder that a machinelike world-view has supported the deadly architecture of the last century.

This mechanistic thinking and the consequent investment-oriented tracts of houses, condominiums and offices have dehumanized our cities and our lives. How are spirit, soul, emotion, feeling to be introduced into a building, or a street, or a development project, in modern times? In this process, he approached religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction, focusing in human feelings, well-being and nature interaction rather than metaphysics.

The Luminous Ground, the fourth book of &quot;The Nature of Order&quot;, contains what is, perhaps, the deepest revelation in the four-volume work. Alexander addresses the cosmological implications of the theory he has presented. The book begins with a critique of current cosmological thinking, and its separation from personal feeling and value. The outline of a theory in which matter itself is more spirit-like, more personal in character, is sketched. Here is a geometrical view of space and matter seamlessly connected to our own private, personal, experience as sentient and knowing creatures. This is not merely an emotional appendix to the scientific theory of the other books. It is at the core of the entire work, and is rooted in the fact that our two sides—our analytical thinking selves, and our vulnerable emotional personalities as human beings—are coterminous, and must be harnessed at one and the same time, if we are ever to really make sense of what is around us, and be able to create a living world.

Alexander breaks away completely from the one-sided mechanical model of buildings or neighborhoods as mere assemblages of technically generated, interchangeable parts. He shows us conclusively that a spiritual, emotional, and personal basis must underlie every act of building or making. And then, in the middle of the book, comes the linchpin of the work—a 100-page chapter on color, which dramatically conveys the way that consciousness and spirit are manifested in the world.

This is a new cosmology: consciousness inextricably joined to the substrate of matter, present in all matter. This view, though radical, conforms to our most ordinary, daily intuitions. It may provide a path for those contemporary scientists who are beginning to see consciousness as the underpinning of all matter, and thus as a proper object of scientific study. And it will change, forever, our conception of what buildings are.

<text>A cryovolcano (sometimes informally referred to as an ice volcano) is a type of volcano that erupts gases and volatile material such as liquid water, ammonia, and hydrocarbons. The erupted material is collectively referred to as &quot;cryolava&quot;; it originates from a reservoir of subsurface &quot;cryomagma&quot;. Cryovolcanic eruptions can take many forms, such as fissure and curtain eruptions, effusive cryolava flows, and large-scale resurfacing, and can vary greatly in output volumes. Immediately after an eruption, cryolava quickly freezes, constructing geological features and altering the surface.

Although rare in the inner Solar System, past and recent cryovolcanism is common on planetary objects in the outer Solar System, especially on the icy moons of the giant planets and potentially amongst the dwarf planets as well. As such, cryovolcanism is important to the geological histories of these worlds, constructing landforms or even resurfacing entire regions. Despite this, only a few eruptions have ever been observed in the Solar System. The sporadic nature of direct observations means that the true number of extant cryovolcanoes is contentious.

Like volcanism on the terrestrial planets, cryovolcanism is driven by escaping internal heat from within a celestial object, often supplied by extensive tidal heating in the case of the moons of the giant planets. However, isolated dwarf planets are capable of retaining enough internal heat from formation and radioactive decay to drive cryovolcanism on their own, an observation which has been supported by both &quot;in situ&quot; observations by spacecraft and distant observations by telescopes.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The term cryovolcano was coined by Steven K. Croft in a 1987 conference abstract at the Geological Society of America (GSA) Abstract with Programs. The term is a compound of cryo-, from the Ancient Greek &quot;κρῠ́ος&quot; (&quot;krúos&quot;, meaning cold or frost), and volcano. In general, terminology used to describe cryovolcanism is analogous to volcanic terminology:
* Cryolava and cryomagma are distinguished in a manner similar to lava and magma. Cryomagma refers to the molten or partially molten material beneath a body&#x27;s surface, where it may then erupt onto the surface. If the material is still fluid, it is classified as cryolava, which can flow in cryolava channels, analogs to lava channels. Explosive eruptions may pulverize the material into a fine &quot;ash&quot; termed cryoclastic material. Cryoclastic material flowing downhill produces cryoclastic flows, analogs to pyroclastic flows.
* A cryovolcanic edifice is a landform constructed by cryovolcanic eruptions. These may take the form of shields (analogous to terrestrial shield volcanoes), cones (analogous to cinder cones and spatter cones), or domes (analogous to lava domes). Cryovolcanic edifices may support secondary landforms, such as caldera-like collapse structures, cryovolcanic flow channels (analogous to lava flow features), and cryovolcanic fields and plains (analogous to lava fields and plains).

As cryovolcanism largely takes place on icy worlds, the term ice volcano is sometimes used colloquially.

== Types of cryovolcanism ==

=== Explosive eruptions ===

Explosive cryovolcanism, or &quot;cryoclastic eruptions&quot;, is expected to be driven by the exsolvation of dissolved volatile gasses as pressure drops whilst cryomagma ascends, much like the mechanisms of explosive volcanism on terrestrial planets. Whereas terrestrial explosive volcanism is primarily driven by dissolved water (), carbon dioxide (), and sulfur dioxide (), explosive cryovolcanism may instead be driven by methane () and carbon monoxide (). Upon eruption, cryovolcanic material is pulverized in violent explosions much like volcanic ash and tephra, producing cryoclastic material.

=== Effusive eruptions ===
Effusive cryovolcanism takes place with little to no explosive activity and is instead characterized by widespread cryolava flows which cover the pre-existing landscape. In contrast to explosive cryovolcanism, no instances of active effusive cryovolcanism have been observed. Structures constructed by effusive eruptions depend on the viscosity of the erupted material. Eruptions of less viscous cryolava can resurface large regions and form expansive, relatively flat plains, similar to shield volcanoes and flood basalt eruptions on terrestrial planets. More viscous erupted material does not travel as far, and instead can construct localized high-relief features such as cryovolcanic domes.

== Mechanisms ==
For cryovolcanism to occur, three conditions must be met: an ample supply of cryomagma must be produced in a reservoir, the cryomagma must have a force driving ascent, and conduits need to be formed to the surface where cryomagma is able to ascend. 

=== Ascent ===
A major challenge in models of cryovolcanic mechanisms is that liquid water is substantially denser than water ice, in contrast to silicates where liquid magma is less dense than solid rock. Therefore, cryomagma must overcome this in order to erupt onto a body&#x27;s surface. Planetary scientists have proposed several hypotheses to explain how cryomagma erupts onto the surface:
* Compositional buoyancy: the introduction of impurities such as ammonia, which is expected to be common in the outer Solar System, can help lower the densities of cryomagmas. However, the presence of impurities in cryomagma alone is unlikely to succeed in overcoming the density barrier. Conversely, the density of the ice shell can be increased through impurities as well, such as the inclusion silicate particles and salts. In particular, objects that are only partially differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle are likely to have ice shells rich in silicate particles.
* Gas-driven buoyancy: besides affecting density, the inclusion of more volatile impurities may help decrease the density of cryomagma as it ascends by the formation of gas bubbles. The volatile compounds are fully dissolved in the cryomagma when pressurized deep beneath the surface. Should the cryomagma ascend, the cryomagma is depressurized. This leads to the exsolution of the volatiles out of the cryomagma, forming gas bubbles that help lower the density of the bulk solution. 
* Internal pressurization: the progressive pressurization of a subsurface ocean as it cools and freezes may be enough to force cryomagma to ascend to the surface due to water&#x27;s unusual property of expanding upon freezing. Internal ocean pressurization does not necessitate the addition of other volatile compounds.

=== Eruption ===
In addition to overcoming the density barrier, cryomagma also requires a way to reach the surface in order to erupt. Fractures in particular, either the result of global or localized stress in the icy crust, providing potential eruptive conduits for cryomagma to exploit. Such stresses may come from tidal forces as an object orbits around a parent planet, especially if the object is on an eccentric orbit or if its orbit changes. True polar wander, where the object&#x27;s surface shifts relative to its rotational axis, can introduce deformities in the ice shell. Impact events also provide an additional source of fracturing by violently disrupting and weakening the crust. 

An alternative model for cryovolcanic eruptions invokes solid-state convection and diapirism. If a portion of an object&#x27;s ice shell is warm and ductile enough, it could begin to convect, much as the Earth&#x27;s mantle does. As the ice convects, warmer ice becomes buoyant relative to surrounding colder ice, rising towards the surface. The convection can be aided by local density differences in the ice due to an uneven distribution of impurities in the ice shell. If the warm ice intrudes on particularly impure ice (such as ice containing large amounts of salts), the warm ice can lead to the melting of the impure ice. The melting may then go on to erupt or uplift terrain to form surface diapirs.

=== Cryomagma reservoirs ===
Cryovolcanism implies the generation of large volumes of molten fluid in the interiors of icy worlds. A primary reservoir of such fluid are subsurface oceans. Subsurface oceans are widespread amongst the icy satellites of the giant planets and are largely maintained by tidal heating, where the moon&#x27;s slightly eccentric orbit allows the rocky core to dissipate energy and generate heat. Evidence for subsurface oceans also exist for the dwarf planets Pluto and, to a lesser extent, Ceres, Eris, Makemake, Sedna, Gonggong, and Quaoar. In the case of Pluto and the other dwarf planets, there is comparatively little, if any, long-term tidal heating. Thus, heating must largely be self-generated, primarily coming from the decay of radioactive isotopes in their rocky cores.

Reservoirs of cryomagma can hypothetically form within the shell of an icy world as well, either from direct localized melting or the injection of cryomagma from a deeper subsurface ocean. A convective layer in the ice shell can generate warm plumes that spread laterally at the base of the brittle icy crust. The intruding warm ice can melt impure ice, forming a lens-shaped region of melting. Other proposed methods of producing localized melts include the buildup of stress within strike-slip faults, where friction may be able to generate enough heat to melt ice; and impact events that violently heat the impact site. Intrusive models, meanwhile, propose that a deeper subsurface ocean directly injects cryomagma through fractures in the ice shell, much like volcanic dike and sill systems.

== Cryomagma composition ==
Water is expected to be the dominant component of cryomagmas. Besides water, cryomagma may contain additional impurities, drastically changing its properties. Certain compounds can lower the density of cryomagma. Ammonia () in particular may be a common component of cryomagmas, and has been detected in the plumes of Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus. A partially frozen ammonia-water eutectic mixture can be positively buoyant with respect to the icy crust, enabling its eruption. Methanol () can lower cryomagma density even further, whilst significantly increasing viscosity. Conversely, some impurities can increase the density of cryomagma. Salts, such as magnesium sulfate () and sodium sulfate () significantly increases density with comparatively minor changes in viscosity. Salty or briny cryomagma compositions may be important cryovolcanism on Jupiter&#x27;s icy moons, where salt-dominated impurities are likely more common. Besides affecting density and viscosity, the inclusions of impurities—particularly salts and especially ammonia—can encourage melting by significantly lowering the melting point of cryomagma.

== Observations ==
Although there are broad parallels between cryovolcanism and terrestrial (or &quot;silicate&quot;) volcanism, such as the construction of domes and shields, the definitive identification of cryovolcanic structures is difficult. The unusual properties of water-dominated cryolava, for example, means that cryovolcanic features are difficult to interpret using criteria applied to terrestrial volcanic features.

=== Ceres ===
Ceres is the innermost object in the Solar System known to be cryovolcanically active. Upon the arrival of the &quot;Dawn&quot; orbiter in March 2015, the dwarf planet was discovered to have numerous bright spots (designated as &quot;faculae&quot;) located within several major impact basins, most prominently in the center of Occator Crater. These bright spots are composed primarily of various salts, and are hypothesized to have formed from impact-induced upwelling of subsurface material that erupt brine to Ceres&#x27;s surface. The distribution of hydrated sodium chloride on one particular bright spot, Cerealia Facula, indicates that the upwelling occurred recently or is currently ongoing. That brine exists in Ceres&#x27;s interior implies that salts played a role in keeping Ceres&#x27;s subsurface ocean liquid, potentially even to the present day. &quot;Dawn&quot; also discovered Ahuna Mons and Yamor Mons (formerly Ysolos Mons), two prominent isolated mountains which are likely young cryovolcanic domes. It is expected that cryovolcanic domes eventually subside after becoming extinct due to viscous relaxation, flattening them. This would explain why Ahuna Mons appears to be the most prominent construct on Ceres, despite its geologically young age.

=== Europa ===

Europa receives enough tidal heating from Jupiter to sustain a global liquid water ocean. Its surface is exceedingly young, at roughly 60 to 90 million years old.
 Its most striking features, a dense web of linear cracks and faults termed &quot;lineae&quot;, appear to be the sites of active resurfacing on Europa, proceeding in a manner similar to Earth&#x27;s mid-ocean ridges. In addition to this, Europa may experience a form of subduction, with one block of its icy crust sliding underneath another.

Despite its young surface age, few, if any, distinct cryovolcanoes have been definitively identified on the Europan surface in the past. Nevertheless, observations of Europa from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in December 2012 detected columns of excess water vapor up to high, hinting at the existence of weak, possibly cryovolcanic plumes. The plumes were observed again by the HST in 2014. However, as these are distant observations, the plumes have yet to be definitively confirmed as eruptions. Recent analyses of some Europan surface features have proposed cryovolcanic origins for them as well. In 2011, Europa&#x27;s chaos terrain, where the crust appears especially disrupted, was interpreted by a team of researchers as the site of very shallow cryomagma lakes. As these subsurface lakes melt and refreeze, they fracture Europa&#x27;s crust into small blocks, creating the chaos terrain. Later, in 2023, a field of cryovolcanic cones was tentatively identified near the western edge of Argadnel Regio, a region in Europa&#x27;s southern hemisphere.

=== Ganymede ===
Ganymede&#x27;s surface, like Europa&#x27;s, is heavily tectonized yet appears to have few cryovolcanic features. By 2009, at least 30 irregularly-shaped depressions (termed &quot;paterae&quot;) were identified on Ganymede&#x27;s surface from &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; imagery. The paterae have been hypothesized by several teams of planetary scientists as caldera-like cryovolcanic vents. However, conclusive evidence for a cryovolcanic origin of these structures remains elusive in imagery.

=== Enceladus ===

Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus is host to the most dramatic example of cryovolcanism yet observed, with a series of vents erupting of material per second that feeds Saturn&#x27;s E ring. These eruptions take place across Enceladus&#x27;s south polar region, sourced from four major ridges which form a region informally known as the &quot;Tiger Stripes&quot;. Enceladus&#x27;s cryovolcanic activity is sustained by a global subsurface ocean. 

Other regions centered on Enceladus&#x27;s leading and trailing hemispheres—the hemispheres that &quot;face&quot; towards or against the direction of Enceladus&#x27;s orbit—exhibit similar terrain to that of the Tiger Stripes, possibly indicating that Enceladus has experienced discrete periods of heightened cryovolcanism in the past.

=== Titan ===

Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan has a dense atmospheric haze layer which permanently obscures visible observations of its surface features, making the definitive identification of cryovolcanic structures especially difficult. Titan has an extensive subsurface ocean, encouraging searches for evidence of cryovolcanism. From &quot;Cassini&quot; radar data, several features have been proposed as candidate cryovolcanoes, most notably Doom Mons, a mountain reminiscent of a shield or dome edifice; and the neighoring Sotra Patera, an ovular depression that resembles a caldera. Several round lakes and depressions in Titan&#x27;s polar regions show structural evidence of an explosive origin, including overlapping depressions, raised rims (or &quot;ramparts&quot;), and islands or mountains within depression rim. These characteristics led to a 2020 hypothesis by planetary scientists Charles A. Wood and Jani Radebaugh that they form from either maar-like eruptions—forming by explosions of boiling subsurface liquid as it is rapidly heated by magma (in this case, cryomagma)—or the flooding of collapse calderas.

=== Uranian moons ===
On 24 January 1986, Uranus and its system of moons were explored for the first time by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft. Of Uranus&#x27;s five major satellites, Miranda and Ariel appear to have unusually youthful surfaces indicative of relatively recent activity. Miranda in particular has extraordinarily varied terrain, with striking angular features known as the &quot;coronae&quot; cutting across older terrain. Inverness Corona is located near Miranda&#x27;s south pole and is estimated to be less than 1 billion years old, and broad similarities between Miranda&#x27;s coronae and Enceladus&#x27;s south polar region have been noted. These characteristics have led to several teams of researchers to propose a cryovolcanic origin of the coronae, where eruptions of viscous cryomagma form the structures with some tectonic involvement. Ariel also exhibits widespread resurfacing, with large polygonal crustal blocks divided by large canyons (&quot;chasmata&quot;) with floors as young as ~0.8 ± 0.5 billion years old, while relatively flat plains may have been the site of large flood eruptions.

Evidence for relatively recent cryovolcanism on the other three round moons of Uranus is less clear. Titania hosts large chasms but does not show any clear evidence of cryovolcanism. Oberon has a massive ~ high mountain that was observed on its limb at the time of &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s flyby; the precise origins of the mountain is unclear, but it may be of cryovolcanic origin.

=== Triton ===

Neptune and its largest moon Triton were explored by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft on 25 August 1989, revealing Triton&#x27;s surface features up close for the first time. With an estimated average surface age of 10–100 million years old, with some regions possibly being only a few million years old, Triton is one of the most geologically active worlds in the Solar System. Large-scale cryovolcanic landforms have been identified on Triton&#x27;s young surface, with nearly all of Triton&#x27;s observed surface features likely related to cryovolcanism. One of Triton&#x27;s major cryovolcanic features, Leviathan Patera, the apparent primary vent of the Cipango Planum cryovolcanic plateau which is one of the largest volcanic or cryovolcanic edifices in the Solar System. 

Triton hosts four walled plains: Ruach Planitia and Tuonela Planitia form a northern pair, and Sipapu Planitia and Ryugu Planitia form a southern pair. The walled plains are characterized by crenulated, irregularly-shaped cliffs that enclose a flat, young plain with a single group of pits and mounds. The walled plains are likely young cryovolcanic lakes and may represent Triton&#x27;s youngest cryovolcanic features. The regions around Ruach and Tuonela feature additional smaller subcircular depressions, some of which are partially bordered by walls and scarps. In 2014, a team of planetary scientists interpreted these depressions as diapirs, caldera collapse structures, or impact craters filled in by cryolava flows. To the south of Tuonela Planitia, isolated conical hills with central depressions have been noted as resembling terrestrial cinder cones, possibly pointing to cryovolcanic activity beyond Tuonela Planitia&#x27;s plains.

Triton&#x27;s southern polar ice cap is marked by a multitude of dark streaks, likely composed of organic tholins deposited by wind-blown plumes. At least two plumes, the Mahilani Plume and the Hili Plume, have been observed, with the two plumes reaching in altitude. These plumes have been hypothesized by numerous teams of researchers in the early 1990s to be driven by the buildup of nitrogen gas underneath solid nitrogen ice through a sort of solid greenhouse effect; however, more recent analysis in 2022 disfavors the solid greenhouse effect model. An alternative cryovolcanic model, first proposed by R. L. Kirk and collaborators in 1995, instead suggests that the plumes represent explosive cryovolcanic eruption columns—an interpretation supported by the estimated observed output rate of ~200 kg/s, comparable to the output of Enceladus&#x27;s plumes.

=== Pluto and Charon ===
The dwarf planet Pluto and its system of five moons were explored by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft in a flyby on 14 July 2015, observing their surface features in detail for the first time. The surface of Pluto varies dramatically in age, and several regions appear to display relatively recent cryovolcanic activity. The most reliably identified cryovolcanic structures are Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, two large mountains with central depressions which have led to hypotheses that they may be cryovolcanoes with peak calderas. The two mountains are surrounded by an unusual region of hilly &quot;hummocky terrain&quot;, and the lack of distinct flow features have led to an alternative proposal in 2022 by a team of researchers that the structures may instead be formed by sequential dome-forming eruptions, with nearby Coleman Mons being a smaller independent dome.

Virgil Fossae, a large fault within Belton Regio, may also represent another site of cryovolcanism on Pluto. An estimated of Virgil Fossae&#x27;s western section was likely the site of a fountaining eruption, spewing and dispersing material that covered surrounding terrain up to away. More recently, in 2021 Hekla Cavus was hypothesized to have formed from a cryovolcanic collapse by a team of two researchers, C. J. Ahrens and V. F. Chevrier. Similarly, in 2021 a team of planetary scientists led by A. Emran proposed that Kiladze, a feature that is formally classified as an impact crater, is actually a cryovolcanic caldera complex.

Although Sputnik Planitia represents the youngest surface on Pluto, it is not a cryovolcanic structure; Sputnik Planitia continuously resurfaces itself with the convective overturning of glacial nitrogen ice, fuelled by Pluto&#x27;s internal heat and sublimation into Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere.

Charon&#x27;s surface dichotomy indicates that a large section of its surface may have been flooded in large, effusive eruptions, similar to the Lunar maria. These floodplains form Vulcan Planitia and may have erupted as Charon&#x27;s internal ocean froze.

=== Other dwarf planets === 
In 2022, low-resolution near-infrared (0.7–5 μm) spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) detected light hydrocarbons and complex organic molecules on the surfaces of the dwarf planets Quaoar, Gonggong, and Sedna. The detection indicated that all three have experienced internal melting and planetary differentiation in their pasts. The presence of volatiles on their surfaces indicates that cryovolcanism may be resupplying methane. JWST spectral observations of Eris and Makemake revealed that hydrogen-deuterium and carbon isotopic ratios indicated that both dwarf planets are actively replenishing surface methane as well, possibly with the presence of a subsurface ocean.

These observations, combined with the discoveries in the Pluto system by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, indicate that icy worlds are capable of sustaining enough heat on their own to drive cryovolcanic activity. In contrast to the icy satellites of the giant planets, where many benefit from extensive tidal heating from their parent planets, the dwarf planets must rely on heat generated primarily or almost entirely by themselves. Leftover primordial heat from formation and radiogenic heat from the decay of radioactive isotopes in their rocky cores likely serve as primary sources of heat. The serpentinization of rocky material or tidal heating from interactions with their satellites.

<text>Robert Marcel Casadesus (; 7 April 1899 – 19 September 1972) was a renowned 20th-century French pianist and composer. He was the most prominent member of a distinguished musical family, being the nephew of Henri Casadesus and Marius Casadesus, husband of Gaby Casadesus, and father of Jean Casadesus.

==Biography==
Casadesus was born in Paris, and studied there at the Conservatoire with Louis Diémer, taking a &quot;Premier Prix&quot; (First Prize) in 1913 and the Prix Diémer in 1920. 
Robert then entered the class of Lucien Capet, who had exceptional influence. Capet had founded a famous quartet that bore his name (Capet Quartet) and in which two of Robert&#x27;s uncles played: Henri and Marcel. 
The Quartet often rehearsed in the Casadesus home, and so it was that Robert was exposed to chamber music. The Beethoven Quartets held no secret for him—he knew them backwards and forwards.

Beginning in 1922, Casadesus collaborated with the composer Maurice Ravel on a project to create piano rolls of a number of his works. Casadesus and Ravel also shared the concert platform in France, Spain and England. Casadesus toured widely as a piano soloist and often performed with his wife, the pianist Gaby (L&#x27;Hôte) Casadesus, whom he married in 1921.

From 1935 Casadesus taught at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau. He and his family spent the Second World War years in the United States and had a home in Princeton, New Jersey. (Among his Princeton neighbors was Albert Einstein, an amateur violinist; the two played Mozart together privately on occasion.)

After the Fall of France in 1940, Robert and Gaby established the Fontainebleau School at Newport, Rhode Island. In 1942 the Fontainebleau School was moved to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires. In 1943, he performed as part of a series of New York concerts meant to raise money for the Coordinating Council of the French Relief Societies.

After the war, in 1946, Robert Casadesus, now Director of the American Conservatory, oversaw its return to Fontainebleau. His pupils included Claude Helffer, Grant Johannesen, Olive Nelson Russell, Monique Haas, Mary Louise Boehm, Carol Lems-Dworkin, and William Eves, who appeared in the Casadesus-based &quot;Bell Telephone Hour&quot; fine arts documentary TV series &quot;The First Family of the Piano&quot; (1967) and was a longtime piano instructor at Bowdoin College. He continued recording and composing; his last composition, the Symphony No. 7, &quot;Israel,&quot; was a tribute to the people of Israel and was dedicated to his frequent collaborator George Szell; Szell died in the year the work was completed, 1970, and it was not premiered until shortly after Casadesus&#x27;s 1972 death, by an ensemble led by conductor Frederic Waldmann at Alice Tully Hall in New York City.

Robert and Gaby Casadesus had three children, Jean, Guy and Therese. Casadesus died in Paris, 19 September 1972, after a brief illness and only a few months after the death of his son Jean in an automobile accident. Gaby Casadesus died in Paris on 12 November 1999. In her later years she edited the works of Ravel for G. Schirmer, Inc.

==Legacy==
A product of the school of French pianism, his style of playing was classical and restrained with a very delicate approach to melody and line. He is especially noted as an interpreter of Mozart. Among his other recordings are those of the complete piano music of Ravel (for which he was awarded the Grand Prix de l&#x27;Academie Charles Cros and the Grand Prix de l&#x27;Academie du Disque), and the Beethoven Violin Sonatas with Zino Francescatti (of which the &quot;Kreutzer&quot; Sonata was filmed and has been released on DVD). &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, a fine arts-related television series broadcast on NBC for many years, produced a one-hour television film, in 1967, on Robert, Gaby and their son Jean, titled &quot;The First Family of the Piano.&quot;

==Recordings==

Casadesus was particularly known for his recordings of Mozart concertos. He recorded Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 27 in B-flat with John Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic in 1941. Later, Casadesus made LP recordings of a number of Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra (sometimes billed as the Columbia Symphony for contractual reasons), including nos. 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 27, often featuring his own cadenzas. Casadesus was joined by his wife Gaby and their son Jean in recordings of Mozart&#x27;s concertos for two and three pianos, accompanied by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. These recordings have been reissued on CD several times by Sony Classical.

He also made recordings of four of Bach&#x27;s concertos for two and three keyboards, issued by Columbia, under the batons of Eugene Ormandy, Pierre Dervaux, and Edmond de Stoutz. Of Beethoven&#x27;s five concertos, Casadesus recorded the First, Fourth, and Fifth, the last two multiple times and the Fourth with his own cadenzas. He also recorded several Beethoven sonatas, for both solo piano and for violin and piano, with his frequent recording partner Zino Francescatti.

Casadesus was also particularly known for his recordings of French repertoire by composers such as Rameau, Chabrier, Fauré, Debussy, and Ravel. In 1951, Casadesus made the first integral recording of the complete solo piano works by Ravel on three LPs for Columbia. He also recorded French works for four hands and two pianos with his wife Gaby.

In addition, Casadesus&#x27; recorded output includes works by Scarlatti, Schubert, Schumann, and Chopin, as well as Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot;. Casadesus also recorded a number of his own compositions.

==Critical assessment==
In &quot;The Art of the Piano&quot;, David Dubal writes of Casadesus: &quot;he became the absolute French pianist, his country&#x27;s finest. Casadesus embodied the qualities of Gallic balance, unforced sound, style, and precision of technique. His sound was crisp, dry, and sparkling, like a vintage champagne. Casadesus was a sophisticated musician, whose pianism was phenomenally supple. His range was wide and his use of the pedals was simply astonishing.&quot;

<text>The Triumph Vitesse is a compact six-cylinder car built by Standard-Triumph from 1962 to 1971. The car was styled by Giovanni Michelotti, and was available in saloon and convertible variants.

The Vitesse name was first used by Austin in the 1914 to 1916 Austin 20 (hp) and 30 (hp) Vitesse models. This was followed in 1922 by G. N.(Godfrey &amp; Nash) on their GN Vitesse Cycle-car, and then by Triumph on a car made from 1935-1938.

After the last Triumph Vitesse was made in 1971, the Vitesse name remained unused until 1982. In 1982, Rover began to use the name on their SD1 until 1986. They also used it from 1984-1990 on the SD3 216, and on the Rover 800 from October 1988 - 1991, at which time it was rebodied as the R17 version. The R17 was produced until 1998 as the Rover Vitesse Sport.

==Vitesse 6==

The Triumph Vitesse was introduced on May 25, 1962 and reused a name previously used by the pre-Second World War Triumph Motor Company from 1936–38. The engine was an inline 6-cylinder performance version of the Triumph Herald small saloon. The Herald had been introduced in 1959 and was a 2-door car styled by the Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. Within two years, Triumph began to give thought to a sports saloon based on the Herald and using their 6-cylinder engine. Michelotti was again approached for styling, and he came up with a car that used almost all body panels from the Herald, combined with a new front end with a slanted 4-headlamp design.

Standard-Triumph fitted a 1596 cc version of their traditional straight-6 derived from the engine used in the Standard Vanguard Six, but with a smaller bore diameter of , compared with the bore on the Vanguard, equipped with twin Solex B32PIH semi-downdraught carburetors. These were soon replaced by B321H carburetors due to issues with accelerator pumps. A &quot;seam&quot; on the cylinder block between the third &amp; fourth cylinders reveals the design beginnings of the 803cc  Standard SC engine block, first used in the Standard Eight of 1953. The gearbox was strengthened and upgraded to closer (more sporting) gear ratios, and also offered with optional Laycock De Normanville &#x27;D-type&#x27; overdrive with a 20% higher ratio for the top gear (the equivalent change from 3rd to 4th in a standard transmission), giving for more relaxed and economical cruising. Models fitted with overdrive had a chrome badge with &quot;Overdrive&quot; in italic text on the left side of the boot opposite the Vitesse 6 chrome script badge on the right. Synchromesh was present on 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears.

The rear axle was changed to a slightly uprated differential, but retaining the same 4.11:1 ratio and flange sizes as the Herald. Front disc brakes were standard as were larger rear brake drums, and the Herald fuel tank was enlarged, retaining the reserve feature (essentially a curved pickup pipe that could be rotated to dip into the last few centimeters of fuel) of the smaller Herald tank. The front suspension featured uprated springs to cope with the extra weight of the new engine, while the rear suspension, a swing-axle transverse-leaf system, was mostly unchanged from the Herald. The chassis looked outwardly similar to the early Heralds, but in fact was substantially re-designed and strengthened, especially around the differential mountings, improvements which were immediately passed through to Herald production. The dash and instrument panel of the earliest Vitesse was the same as the Herald, with a single speedometer dial featuring fuel and temperature gauge insets. The Vitesse was available in convertibles and saloon forms; a coupé never got beyond the prototype stage. The separate chassis construction of the car meant that no additional strengthening to chassis or body was considered necessary for the convertible model, the only concession being additional door catches to prevent the doors opening during hard cornering.

A handful of Vitesse estates also were assembled to special order at Standard-Triumph&#x27;s Service Depot at Park Royal in West London.

The Vitesse received a more luxurious interior compared to the Herald; wooden door capping were added to match the wooden dashboard and the car featured slightly better seats and door trims. Optional extras included a vinyl/fabric &#x27;Britax Weathershield&#x27; sunroof on saloon models. Exterior trim was also improved with an elongated stainless steel trim piece which extended further down the body than the Herald, including a Vitesse specific piece of trim rearward of the petrol filler cap and satin-silver anodized alloy bumper capping replacing the white rubber Herald items.

In September 1963 the Vitesse received its first facelift, when the dashboard was revised with a full range of Smith instruments instead of the large single dial from the Herald (large speedometer and cable driven tachometer flanked by smaller 2 inch fuel and temperature gauges). From September 1965, at commission number HB27986, the twin Solex carburettors were replaced by twin Stromberg CD 150 carburetors. Power output increased from the original at 5,000 rpm and torque of . There was a claimed increase of 13–14 bhp, and the motoring magazine tested top speed rose to , with the time decreasing from 46.6 seconds to 33.6 seconds.

The Vitesse 6 sold extremely well for Triumph, proving to be the most popular Vitesse sold during the model&#x27;s lifetime. The car received initial praise for its performance, fuel economy, interior and tight turning circle.

==Sports 6==
The Vitesse 6 convertible was exported to the US as the left-hand drive Triumph Sports 6 from 1962 until 1964. Original US price (POE East Coast) was $2,499, and it was offered in White, Signal Red or Black. The Vitesse Saloon was never officially imported to the US. Due to its high retail price and competition from cars such as Ford&#x27;s new Mustang, only 679 were sold before it was withdrawn from the market.

==Vitesse 2-Litre==

In September 1966, Triumph upgraded the engine to 1998cc, in line with the new Triumph GT6 coupé, and relaunched the Vitesse as the Vitesse 2-Litre. Power was increased to , endowing the new car with a claimed 0–60 mph time of just under 12 seconds, and lifting top speed to . (The 2-Litre was advertised by Triumph as &quot;The Two Seater Beater&quot;). Other detail modifications for the &quot;2-litre&quot; included a stronger clutch, all synchromesh gearbox, larger front brakes, and a stronger differential with a slightly higher 3.89:1 ratio. Wider &amp; stronger 4.5-inch wheel rims were fitted, but radial-ply tyres were still optional at extra cost. 
There was a satin silver anodized aluminium-alloy cowling above the new reversing light, and badges on the side of the bonnet and in the centre of the grille read 2 litre. The Vitesse boot badge was retained as italic script but lost the 6 of the earlier model - replacing that with the rectangular 2 litre badge and with a chrome strip underlining the Vitesse badge. Cars with overdrive had a separate badge on the cowling above the number plate/reversing light. 
Inside the car, the seats were improved, with softer (more plush) covering and a better back-rest shape which slightly improved rear-seat knee-room. A new leather-covered three-spoke steering wheel was also added. The Vitesse Mk I was sold until 1968.

==Vitesse Mk II==
The Vitesse Mark 2 was launched in October 1968 as the final update to the Vitesse range. For the Mark 2, Triumph focused on improvements to the rear suspension by fitting new lower wishbones and Rotoflex half-shaft couplings. This system, also shared with the new GT6 MKII (GT6+ in the US market), and the first GT6 MkIIIs, improved higher speed handing and roadholding. The solid swing axles of the Herald and earlier Vitesses had camber changes of some 15 degrees from the limits of travel. By adding the lower wishbone and the divided drive shaft whilst retaining the transverse leaf spring as the top link, this camber change was reduced to about 5 degrees.

There were other improvements: the engine was tweaked once more to provide , cutting the 0–60 mph time to just over 11 seconds and providing a top speed of over . The main changes were to the valve timing, to give earlier opening and later closing of the inlet valves compared with the earlier 2-litre engine. (38/78 btdc/atdc for the Mk2 vs 30/60 for the 2 litre). Design changes to the cylinder head allowed for increased inlet valve diameters and better porting. Another major difference in the cylinder head removed the &quot;step&quot; in earlier 1600 and 2 litre incarnations. This meant that in the earlier cars the head studs on the right (manifold) side were short and ended under the manifolds, necessitating unbolting the (hot) manifolds and dropping them back to retorque the studs after a head gasket replacement. The MKII head was full width so all the studs were accessible. The inlet manifolds of the MkII were shorter than the 2 litre to keep inlet tract length the same. The Stromberg carburetors were also changed from 150 CD to 150 CDS, the S referring to the use of a spring between the dashpot cover and piston.

The exterior featured a new grille with 3 sets of horizontal elements that were also used (in longer form) in the Herald 13/60, Rostyle wheel trims and silver painted steel rear panel (described by Triumph as &quot;ceramic&quot;). The interior was upgraded once more in order to share parts with the new Herald 13/60, though the Vitesse included a tachometer and larger ashtray. A new colour range was offered for the Mark 2 models. The aluminium cowling above the reversing light gained an oblong chromed VITESSE badge, and the separate chromed Mazak TRIUMPH letters on the bonnet and the boot lid were also deleted. The badges on the bonnet sides were changed to read Mk2 instead of 2 litre. Cars with overdrive had a small badge that fitted below the new rectangular Triumph boot badge.

The Vitesse continued to sell well until its discontinuation in July 1971, seven months before being replaced by the Triumph Dolomite.

<text>Bear Butte is a geological laccolith feature located near Sturgis, South Dakota, United States, that was established as a State Park in 1961. An important landmark and religious site for the Plains Indians tribes long before Europeans reached South Dakota, Bear Butte is called Matȟó Pahá, or Bear Mountain, by the Lakota, or Sioux. To the Cheyenne, it is known as Noahȧ-vose (&quot;giving hill&quot;) or Náhkȯhe-vose (&quot;bear hill&quot;), and is the place where Ma&#x27;heo&#x27;o (Great Spirit) imparted to Sweet Medicine, a Cheyenne prophet, the knowledge from which the Cheyenne derive their religious, political, social, and economic customs.

The mountain is sacred to many indigenous peoples, who make pilgrimages to leave prayer cloths and tobacco bundles tied to the branches of the trees along the mountain&#x27;s flanks. Other offerings are often left at the top of the mountain. The site is associated with various religious ceremonies throughout the year. The mountain is a place of prayer, meditation, and peace.

The park includes a campsite west of South Dakota Highway 79 where horseback riding, fishing, and boating are permitted. On the summit side of Highway 79, a moderately sized herd of bison roams the base of the mountain. An education center and a summit trail are available. Official park policy advises visitors to Bear Butte to respect worshipers and to leave religious offerings undisturbed. Park fees are waived for those undertaking religious activities. Some nearby land was also obtained by some Native American tribes in later years as well.

The summit of the butte is the northern terminus of the South Dakota Centennial Trail.

==Geological history==

Bear Butte is not strictly a butte (created primarily by erosion of sedimentary strata), but a laccolith: an intrusive body of igneous rock, uplifting the earlier sedimentary layers, which have since largely eroded away. This is the result of the forcible entry (or intrusion) of magma into cooler crustal rock in the Black Hills area during the Eocene Epoch. In this, Bear Butte shares a similar geological history with other formations in the region, including the Black Hills, Devils Tower, the Missouri Buttes, and some parts of the Rocky Mountains. It is possible that when the intrusion was emplaced, some magma may have breached the surface, forming a volcano; however, it would have eroded away long ago.

The peak rises above the surrounding plain and measures above sea level.

==Modern history==
Human artifacts have been found on or near Bear Butte that date back 10,000 years, indicating a long and continuous interest in the mountain. The Cheyenne and Lakota people have maintained a spiritual interest in Bear Butte from their earliest recorded history.

Notable visitors like Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, and Sitting Bull made pilgrimages to the site. In 1857, a council of many Indian nations gathered at Bear Butte to discuss the growing presence of white settlers in the Black Hills.

Violating a treaty of 1868, George Armstrong Custer led an expedition to the Black Hills region in 1874, and according to custom he camped near Bear Butte. Custer verified the rumors of gold in the Black Hills, and Bear Butte then served as an easily identifiable landmark for the rush of invading prospectors and settlers into the region. Indian reaction to the illegal movements of whites into the area was intense and hostile. Ultimately the government reneged on its treaty obligations regarding the Black Hills and instead embarked on a program to confine all northern Plains tribes to reservations.

Ezra Bovee homesteaded on the southern slopes of the mountain, and by the time of World War II, he and his family were the legal owners of the site. In the spring of 1945, the Northern Cheyenne received permission from Bovee to hold a ceremony at Bear Butte to pray for the end of World War II. The Cheyenne found that the Bovee family welcomed their interest in the mountain, and over the years the Bovees continued to encourage native religious ceremonies.

By the mid-1950s Ezra Bovee was attempting to stir up interest in making Bear Butte a national park. After his death, his family continued the effort. When federal interest in the project waned, the state government in Pierre took action, and Bear Butte became a state park in 1961 and was registered as a National Historic Landmark in 1981.

Frank Fools Crow, the Lakota ceremonial chief (d. 1989), made pilgrimages to Bear Butte throughout his lifetime. Fools Crow taught racial harmony not just between whites and Indians, but among all the peoples of the world. He believed the Lakota should never sell the Black Hills. A bust and plaque in front of the education center at Bear Butte State Park honor Fools Crow&#x27;s efforts.

Frank Fools Crow was the plaintiff in one of the most prominent attempts by Native Americans to gain access to sacred lands under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. The case, &quot;Fools Crow v. Gullett&quot;, related to the introduction in 1982 of limits on when and for how long Lakota and Cheyenne religious ceremonies could take place on the Bluff. The Indian Americans argued that both the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the First Amendment protected their right to unlimited access to the Bluff. They also wanted the Bluff to remain untouched as it was sacred. The plaintiffs lost their case on both the District and Appellate level and were denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.

In 2011, the National Trust for Historic Preservation included Bear Butte on its list of the 11 Most Endangered Places. Between 2016 and 2018, Native American tribes such as the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribe of Oklahoma, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota acquired land around the butte due to the cultural significance.

<text>Sir William Alfred Stevenson (19 May 1901 – 29 November 1983) was a New Zealand industrialist, philanthropist and local-body politician. He was also active in rowing, both as a competitor and official, and was a noted big-game fisherman.

==Biography==

Stevenson was born in 1901, the son of Laura (née Paterson) and William Stevenson, who in 1913 founded the company that would grow into the Stevenson Group.

He was educated at Albany Primary School on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore and began working as a carpenter for his father. In 1921 the business expanded into construction. Stevenson and his brother Jim took over after their father became ill, and later his sons Bill, Jack and Ross became involved, the company eventually becoming a major contracting firm that was registered as a company on 24 September 1931.

William Alfred Stevenson Married Ruby Charlotte Ross (b.1897) in 1924, and they lived in Bulls, Pahiatua and Sanson while WA moved around the north island for work. Their first son also William Alfred (Bill) was born in 1928, followed by John Kennedy (Jack, b.1929), and then James Ross (Ross b.1932 in Palmerston North), before the family relocated to Karaka near Auckland around 1938. In 1939 WA purchased a Homestead and land in Cockle Bay, Howick and Daughter Colleen Margaret Rose (b.1942) completed the family.

He served as chairman of the Howick Town Board from 1944 to 1947, and was the second mayor of Howick, following its inauguration as a borough, from 1953 to 1962.

Stevenson won New Zealand single and double sculls rowing titles between 1923 and 1926. Later, he managed the rowing camp at Lake Karapiro for the 1950 British Empire Games, coached and managed the New Zealand rowing team to the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, and was manager of the New Zealand rowing team at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

A keen fisherman, Stevenson was a member of the Mercury Bay Game Fishing Club, and was the first person in the world to catch a tuna, marlin and shark each weighing more than . He held the Australasian record for a black marlin, caught off Cairns, with a weight of . A horse breeder and owner, Stevenson enjoyed success with his horse Jandell, whose wins included the 1973 Avondale Guineas, and the 1975 Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Randwick in Sydney, beating champion mare Leilani.

In 1958, Stevenson purchased the Lochinver Station on the Rangitaiki Plains between Napier and Taupō, and transformed it into a productive farming operation with a carrying capacity of over 100,000 stock units.
As a philanthropist, Stevenson supported many causes and charities, and was particularly interested in the medical area, donating to various hospitals, St. John Ambulance, and endowing chairs in orthopaedic surgery and ophthalmology and an associate professorship in plastic surgery at the University of Auckland.

In the 1954 New Year Honours, Stevenson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the community, and he was promoted to Knight Commander of the same order in the 1965 New Year Honours. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of St John in 1962, made an honorary member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1975, and, in 1978, awarded an honorary DSc by the University of Auckland.Personal Motto of Sir William Alfred &quot;Alf&quot; Stevenson &quot;DEO ADJUVANTE LABOR PROFICIT&quot; 

=== Humble beginnings ===
Born in 1901 in Auckland, Sir William left Albany Primary School, North Harbour at age 17 to join the drainage business of his father, William Stevenson.  In 1921, the firm bought a Model-T Ford, three wheelbarrows and some picks and shovels and branched out into the construction business.  Sir William took over the firm after his father fell ill and later brought in his three sons, Bill, Jack and Ross.  Education might not have played a significant part in his success but practical skills and courage certainly did.  Among his first contracts was the drainage tunnels into the volcanic strata of Mt Eden, Auckland and the hard clay of New Lynn, West Auckland. This involved Sir William spending hours underground using a tap drilling method.  But it was on the outfalls at Devonport and Takapuna on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore and at New Plymouth that another of Sir William&#x27;s skills- skin-diving- came to the fore.  He would go down 15 ft to place gelignite under sealed rocks without the aid of a snorkel.  His &quot;wetsuit&quot; was a pair of saddle-tweed pants and a generous coating of hammer of grease.  During World War II, W Stevenson &amp; Sons Ltd was awarded several key military contracts and after the war it won major North Island construction contracts including those for much of Auckland&#x27;s Southern Motorway, the Greenlane- Penrose bypass, the Glenbrook steel mill site and the Nihotupu  dam in the Waitakere Ranges.  The most significant of these projects was the 1948 removal of overburden at Kopuku Opencast Coal Mine – this project lasted over 39 years.

=== Domestic life at Waikiteroa ===
With the business growing WA bought a homestead and five acres on the cliff at Cockle Bay in 1939 and moved there with the family.  This white weatherboard home, with its orange tiled roof and long driveway was surrounded by extensive lawns, orchards, and gardens, with 45 acres of adjacent farmland for grazing cattle and keeping horses.  The house had been named Waikiteroa meaning &#x27;long water view&#x27;.  The boys started school in Howick, often riding ponies there.  WA built stables and bred ponies, then as the boys got older, he bred hunters.  Later they also got involved in thoroughbreds, breeding horse racers and trotters.  WA also built a full-sized boxing ring in an old tennis pavilion that he had obtained from the Takapuna Tank Farm site and each week an ex heavyweight boxing champion, Mack McCarthy, used to come to train the three brothers.  At Howick the three boys shared an outside bedroom where a fourth bed was periodically used by Grandpa Stevenson.  Grandpa Stevenson unfortunately was later diagnosed with dementia and had to be moved to a care home.  Grandpa Ross also lived there in a converted garage and helped with the gardens. 
Colleen&#x27;s early childhood was more settled than her brothers as they had moved frequently and by the time Colleen arrived WA and Ruby had moved into the comfortable Howick house, and they never moved again.  The house was much admired for its expansive gardens.  Ruby&#x27;s gardening loves were ferns kept in an enclosed verandah, and a rockery planted with bluebells and other traditional plants.  WA took care of the vast rose collection and the myriad of fruit trees.  In the garden wisteria grew over a pergola to shelter plants that favored dark and damp conditions, in later years this grotto became a favourite place for the grandchildren to play.  Even after WA had relinquished much of the gardening work on the property he continued to care for the fruit trees when he was in his 70&#x27;s.  Unfortunately he was on a slope in the orchard when he slipped and fell and wound up having to have hip replacement surgery.  This gave him the idea to build a swimming pool at home to help his rehabilitation.  The family had a pet budgie called Peter and a collie dog called Pat. Pat was so gentle he even allowed young Colleen to ride his back.  At Christmas everything was cooked out of the garden, Lady Ruby and the housekeeper would make a traditional pudding months before.  Later on the meat came from Lochinver, and at the back of Drury Quarry there were turkeys which they would also enjoy for Christmas dinner.  There was a food storage safe in a tree near the clothesline and Ruby would pull a string to lower and raise it.  The wind would blow through the tree and keep the butter, milk, cooked meat cool for a day or two.

=== Family man ===
Wednesday night was poker night and usually involved two or three couples, including Jeff Jeffries the gardener and his wife.  They would play with pennies and matchsticks and everyone would bring a plate of sandwiches for supper at 10pm.  The Jeffries lived in a cottage on the property, as well as being gardener Jeff used to work as a truck driver for the firm. 

A film room was built at the house with a pull down screen and WA would bring home 16mm movies for the family and friends to enjoy on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  He was also an avid collector of Dresden China, collecting pieces every time he went overseas.
There was a small shelly beach at the bottom of the garden which was reached by a green painted wooden zig zag stairway.  Later they built a shed with a speed boat in it to follow the rowers as they practiced.  The children would boil cockles in a billy and serve them in bread with salt and pepper on the beach.  Later WA employed someone full time to attend to the horses.  Colleen&#x27;s job on Mondays was to poke the bed sheets underwater in the copper boiled over a fire.  Later on she was allowed to turn the handle for the wringer washing machine.

With WA working long hours the boys were given regular chores and were expected to help keep the property in order.  They had to mow the vast lawns once a week, two pairs of WA&#x27;s boots had to be cleaned each morning, the cars washed twice a week, plus feeding the horses all the while going to Howick District High School.

Lady Ruby&#x27;s sister Muriel was unmarried and also lived with the Stevensons on and off;  she largely looked after Colleen when she stayed.  From age 5 Colleen attended boarding school at St Annes School in Takapuna.  Every two weeks she would return home for a half day on Sundays to enjoy a traditional roast dinner with her brothers and parents.  The dining room looked over the harbour and there was a great view of the boats passing by.  The boys went on to attend Auckland Grammar School and at the age of 12 Colleen moved to board at Diocesan School for Girls in the city.  WA bought a 200 acre farm at Whitford during the war where he had horses, this was later sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be developed as a country club.  The Whitford Park Golf Club opened on the site in 1968 with swimming pools, tennis courts and other facilities.  In conjunction with the RSA, proceeds from the sale went to fund Stevenson Village, a returned servicemen&#x27;s housing complex.

Summer holidays were spent at the family bach at Rotoiti.  It was a five hour drive with the family stopping at Cambridge for an ice-cream and fresh sandwiches.  While the bach was eventually fitted with modern appliances it was a basic house without electricity for many years.  Nights were spent listening to the wind up phonograph, playing carpet bowls, and sitting in front of the fire.  The uninsulated corrugated roof made listening to the rain a pleasure.  WA didn&#x27;t want the phone there for years, if he wanted to check for messages he would go in the boat to the Post Office and use their phone.  Electricity and phone lines were eventually installed and a green asphalt tennis court was also added.  WA enjoyed fishing on the lake, often taking other businessmen, and they smoked trout in a purpose built shed on the property.  WA also bought a property at Tarawera and employed a boatman, Norm Keene, to maintain both the boats and properties.  When the children became adults and married;  Bill to Nari, Jack to Pam, Ross to Norma and Colleen to Don, the Waikiteroa residence remained a special place to celebrate family gatherings such as birthdays and Christmases surrounded by their four children, their spouses and thirteen grandchildren.

=== Business man ===
Sir William&#x27;s other achievements were equally impressive.  A first-class rower, he was NZ single-skulls champion in 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1927. He was double-skulls champion in 1925 and 1926. Years later, he did his best to turn a disused quarry beside Auckland&#x27;s Lakė Pupuke into an international rowing course but eventually settled &quot;for Lake Karapiro&quot;. In 1950, he was named manager of the Empire games rowing camp at Karapiro and four years later he managed the NZ rowing contingent to the Vancouver Empire Games. In 1964 he was appointed manager of  the NZ team to the Tokyo Olympics- the team that included Peter Snell, Murray Halberg and John Davies. Privately, Sir William&#x27;s donations and endowments were impressive. These ranged from financing the rebuilding of St Thomas Church, St Heliers, Auckland, and generous equipment donations to hospitals, endowing the chairs of orthopedics and plastic surgery and a lectureship in ophthalmic studies at Auckland University and helping set up the Laura Fergusson Trust for Disabled persons.  In spite of Sir William&#x27;s extensive business interests, be found time for local-body politics, fishing, breeding horses and financing Lochinver Station on the Napier/Taupo Road which was developed by his son, Ross Snr.  In 1979 Sir William broke a five-year-old world fishing record, catching a Black Marlin off Cairns weighing 1,231.5 lbs.  He never became obsessed with wealth or the intricacies of high finance.  He told the Auckland Star in 1970: &quot;Finance was never one of my greatest worries because I knew what I could do and where I was heading ... Big finance is only a matter of common-sense... Sir William&#x27;s governance of WA Stevenson &amp; Sons was characterized by grit, hard work, self belief and determination. The years following were marked by expansive growth and diversification, which eventually built Stevenson&#x27;s into one of New Zealand&#x27;s major contractors. &quot;What is success?  It is the pride of achievement.&quot;

=== Sportsman ===
When asked what was the basis of Sir William&#x27;s staggering success in business and life in general, the answer came simply: &quot;Why – sport of course&quot;

==== The rower ====

Sir William started rowing in the late 1900s- fours, eights and pairs, as all young oarsmen do before specializing in any particular class of rowing.  Single sculls drew the Stevenson preference and he became a four time New Zealand Single Sculls Champion, starting in 1922 in Auckland Rowing Club colours.  In 1923 at Bluff he became the only New Zealander at that time to win the Single and Double Sculls (with Doug Smith) on the same day.  This was repeated in Dunedin in 1924 (1925) and winning again in 1926. During the latter period Sir William was rowing for the Waitemata Rowing Club whose headquarters were then opposite the Railway Station on the waterfront road storage area.  He competed in the Henley-On-Yarra Regatta at Melbourne in 1927 achieving second to the World&#x27;s Champion of that period in the Single Sculls.  Unfortunately around the late 1920s he was forced to abandon rowing while still in his prime, to concentrate his efforts on the pressures of a growing business.  A little over two decades later he came back to the rowing world to take up the role of Coach for two of his sons, Bill and Jack, who he coached as a Double Sculls crew in the late 1940s.  History repeated itself, when in 1952, 30 years later after his own success in the same Championships, he coached Jack into first place in the National Single Sculls Championship in Wellington.  That same day, another father/son record was taken when Jack and Bill Hunter won the Double Sculls.
The father/son team continued their success in the following years with Jack claiming seven more NZ titles.  In 1954 Sir William coached Don Rowlands to the Empire Games in Vancouver, where another double achievement was realised when he was made Manager of the Rowing Team. Don Rowlands was successful in winning a Gold Medal. Sir William continued to assist Don in his sculling career on their return home and Don went on to win six NZ titles. With interests in the Waikato – Roose Shipping etc., Sir William came closer to the Mercer Rowing Club where he coached a four to take the NZ Championship at Invercargill in 1955. That crew consisted of Charlie Lofroth, Paul Bridgeman, Bob Parker and Norm Cox,  all of whom worked for W. Stevenson &amp; Sons Limited at some stage.  There was however, one trophy Sir William had never coached a crew for, that being the Thompson Memorial Gold Cup for Inter-Businesshouse Rowing.  In 1959 Jack suggested a crew and Sir William took up the challenge.  Rules for the competition stated two experienced oarsmen, Jack in the Stroke seat and Paul Bridgeman in the No.3 seat and two novice oarsmen, Jon Twigg in the No.2 seat and Earle Wells in the bow.  The coxswain was Colin Gray.  This crew all worked at Kopuku at that time and trained on the river at Mercer.  So it was, that after several months of hard training, lots of practice and perseverance on behalf of Sir William, he had the satisfaction of seeing his crew win the Thompson Memorial on the Tamaki River.  Rowing Administration bore the Stevenson mark.  Auckland and Waitemata Committee&#x27;s in his youth, the Auckland Rowing Assoc.  in the late 50s and later Vice President and President of the NZ Rowing Assoc.  All this, along with the assistance given many crews from clubs and colleges around the Province made Sir William one of the leading figures in the New Zealand rowing world.  He held all three Champion Jackets, i.e.  A Red Coat (indicating a National Champion);  a Green Coat (having Coached a National Champion] and the Black NZ Representative Jacket. Jack also holds all three jackets, which is a NZ father/son record that still stands.

==== The fisherman ====
Watersport was well and truly injected into the Stevenson veins for another favourite pursuit was that of fishing.  A young William Stevenson started his fishing career playing eels in the local Albany creeks.  Almost seven decades later he had fished all over the globe from the lakes of NZ, the tropics of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands to the freezing North Atlantic waters off Canada&#x27;s New Brunswick and caught almost every game fish there is to catch.  The mark of a true sportsmran was left on many a fin, when, having fought and won the battle with the greats of the ocean, they were tagged and released to freedom.  Despite this he had several game fishing records to his credit.  The most meritorious being the &quot;Big Three&quot;.  55 While fishing off Cairns in October 1970 during a particularly good game fishing season, Sir William broke World Record of five years with a Black Marlin weighing in at 1,231½lb.  A fitting tribute to a truly magnificent fish.  Giant Bluefin (tuna) had always interested Sir William – he had taken big ones off New Foundland and the Bahamas but the quest for a 1,000 lb tuna to go with the 1,000 lb billfish was a hard one as there had been probably no more than to  fifteen ever landed on rod and reel.  However in 1975 at Carracut, New Brunswick, in the St Laurence estuary the search paid off. After the disappointment of losing the first giant, estimate around 1,200 lb, while the wire was in the mates hand and just out of the gaffing range, another  thrill was realised when he landed a 1,080 lb Blue Fin just 40 lb short of another World Record.  Half the unique challenge was met and the search was on for the magic four figure shark.  In June 1976 Queensland&#x27;s Cape Moreton, famous for its great white sharks whose feeding grounds were associated with the now discontinued whaling stations, was chosen for the most likely success.  It was, however, a Tiger Shark that clinched &quot;The Big Three&quot; when, after what was considered probably unprecedented fishing – four tigers over 800 lb in four hours, the last monster caught weighed in at 1,002 lb.  Sir William&#x27;s fishing feats were recognised in NZ when in 1976 he was awarded the &quot;Old Man of the Sea&quot; trophy for the most meritorious catch.

==== The horse owner ====
Sir William included racing in his wide range of sporting interests with notable success. He started racing horses in the 1950s, and his love for horses led him into establishing his own thoroughbred stud at Whitford. On many occasions through the years his yearlings topped the national sales and he had in many cases added delight of watching his foals turn into winners. Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s he enjoyed much success with horses such as Miss Shona, Kerry Dawn, Marandellas and Mikasha. Nipawin, winner of many races including the Parliamentary Handicap in 1969; Sheralee, the top two-year-old for her year and winner of many races as a three-year-old contributed by more than half to make Sir William 4th leading stakes owner in New Zealand for the season ending July 1971. Moonmist (the only horse mentioned here not bred from his own mares) was winner of eight races and gave Brian Andrews his 100th win in the 1971 season, making him only the 4th jockey at that time to enjoy such success. Probably Sir William&#x27;s favourite was the filly Jandell, a grand mare winner of many classic races and cups, culminating in her victory over Leilani, the top Australian mare, in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Sydney in April 1975. Jandell was named by sports writers as &quot;Australasian Filly of the Year&quot;, which gave Sir William much pride and satisfaction. Jandell has progeny from champion sires such as Balmerino and Sir Tristram, and Sir William was elated when she produced a filly from the top sire Sovereign Edition in 1981. The filly was named Janzome and was shaping up to be as outstanding as her mother. She won her first race in the two-year-old trials, by 10 lengths, but then tragedy struck. While on a training run she broke her leg so severely that it was doubtful if she would live. Sir William sought expert advice and with a remarkable piece of veterinary skill, she was saved as a brood mare. In the early 1980s, Sir William ventured into standardbred racing, having dabbled a little with Red Slipper back in the 1950s and was successful with Debbie Direct and his pacer Never Bend, who won six races before going to the US. His last purchase was a yearling named Empire Lobell now rated as an open class trotter and since Sir William&#x27;s death in 1983 had been raced by Bill, Jack and Ross Stevenson with moderate success.

==== Other sporting moments ====
In 1950 he was named Manager of the Empire Games Rowing Camp at Karapiro, having spent months totally landscaping and grassing over half a mile of the riverbank to provide spectator accommodation for thousands of people at his own cost.  In 1954 he was named manager – coach of the NZ Rowing contingent to the Empire Games in Vancouver.

He assisted numerous sporting clubs with funds and services, from Rugby League to Golf – a four-oared boat for the Rotorua Rowing Club – a rowing training tank in Auckland – funds for overseas competition for athletes of all codes – laying the Lovelock athletic track –  where others just talked about, Sir William moved in and did it.

  The New Year Honours List of 1954 listed Mr. W.A.  Stevenson of Howick as being awarded the OBE (Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for Service in the field of Sport and Social Welfare and he was invested by the Queen at Wellington, during the Royal Tour of that year.  For, not only did he achieve success as a competitor himself, but also ensured that others were given the opportunity to further their own sporting careers.  Perhaps Sir William&#x27;s proudest after many years of association with all codes of sport culminated in his appointment as manager of the NZ team to the Tokyo Olympics.  That pride would have been complete when Jack Stevenson was named Manager of the Rowing section.

=== Supporting community ===
As his business flourished and Sir William turned his hand to the administration of its growth, he was able to give back to his community some of the fruits of his endeavors, Sir William played an active part in local body politics for sixteen years-  nine of those years were spent as Mayor of Howick, during which time he offered as a gift to the Government in 1958 the family farm at Cockle Bay, for the Vice-Regal Residence (the property we know now as Waikiteroa Subdivision): drained and  developed Nixon Park for Bowling Greens;  provided grants of thousands of dollars to local sporting clubs, schools and service organisations.  In 1961 he set up a special trust for an annual award to enable and encourage young engineers to work and study overseas to improve their knowledge and techniques in civil engineering construction.  His involvement with opencast mining at Kopuku led him to provide funds for the establishment of a Fellowship to accelerate coal research in 1964. In 1968 Sir William and Lady Stevenson provided funds to purchase the historic Shamrock Cottage which they handed over to the Howick Borough council enabling  restoration work to be carried out.  The Stevenson Village- a pensioner housing project with recreational and hospital facilities- is further tribute to the benevolence of Sir William and Lady Stevenson.  The Village, opened May 1975, was run in conjunction with the Howick RSA of which Sir William was Patron for over 20 years.

==== Philanthropy ====
Another gift from Sir William to the people of Auckland was in 1958 when he rebuilt St Thomas&#x27; Church in Kohimarama.  The Church was constructed in the grounds of the old St Thomas&#x27; in 1947 and condemned as dangerous only 17 years later.  The designs based on the original structure only larger, were drawn up by Mr. Murray Le Grice, an Engineer with W. Stevenson &amp; Sons at that time.  In keeping with his marine interests, Sir William sponsored the late Kelly Tarlton and co-diver Wade Doak in 1968 in the excavation and salvage of the &quot;Boyd&quot;, which was burnt and sunk in Whangaraoa Harbour in 1809. Many of the salvaged artefacts are  now on display in Northland Museums.  Boaties who have strained their eyes in the darkness looking for a safe approach to Kawau Island have probably heaved a sigh of relief once sighting the familiar &quot;Martello &#x27;light, to guide them past the dangers of the outer reefs. Few would realise that the true  thanks should go to Sir William, who in 1962 financed the two automatic electronic beacons. One was placed on Martello Rock, the other on Kawati Point and named, on Sir William&#x27;s instruction, Dyson and Thornton lights respectively after two former Senior Auckland Engineers.

==== Supporting medicine ====

It was however, the medical research and surgical fields that captured the true interest and respect of Sir William.  Having enjoyed good health himself, he did everything in his power to ensure that others less fortunate led a comfortable life.  In 1962 Sir William provided funds for the building and setting up of the University of Auckland Anatomy School at Green Lane hospital, enabling courses in physiology and pathology to be undertaken in Auckland.  In 1965 he financed a lecture course in Auckland in cardiac surgery and heart-lung physiology attended by the worlds leading surgeons, amongst them, Dr Christiaan Barnard.

In 1975 Sir William endowed two teaching chairs at the Auckland University School of Medicine.  Through the establishment of a Trust, the chair in Orthopedic Surgery enabled teaching and research and provided funds for research and development in Orthopedic Surgery.  The second chair was that of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery which funded teaching and research in that area.  He also provided Middlemore Hospital with micro-surgery equipment necessary for plastic surgery.  In 1977 Sir William endowed a further Chair at the Auckland School of Medicine known as the Sir William and Lady Stevenson Chair of Ophthalmology.  It was the first established professorship in NZ dealing with and made Sir William the only person to have established three chairs at the University.  He also provided Christchurch Hospital with equipment for diagnosing certain diseases of the eyes.  eye diseases Sir William gained enormous please from meeting people who had benefited from his benevolence.  They included a man who, unable to see for seven years because of an eye disease was able to drive his car following surgery;  a man, who after a factory accident had his hand sewn on again using the micro-surgery equipment and Middlemore and numerous people underwent cardiac surgery with equipment provided by himself.  In 1983 he set up the Sir William and Lady Stevenson Deafness Research Fellowship, funding research and development in deafness and related ear problems.

=== Death and legacy ===
On 29 November 1983, Stevenson died at the age of 82. In 1995, he was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1180800" wikidata="Q7113766" url="?curid=1180800" title="Overlapping subproblems">
<text>In computer science, a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.
For example, the problem of computing the Fibonacci sequence exhibits overlapping subproblems. The problem of computing the &quot;n&quot;th Fibonacci number &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), can be broken down into the subproblems of computing &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1) and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 2), and then adding the two. The subproblem of computing &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1) can itself be broken down into a subproblem that involves computing &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 2). Therefore, the computation of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 2) is reused, and the Fibonacci sequence thus exhibits overlapping subproblems.

A naive recursive approach to such a problem generally fails due to an exponential complexity. If the problem also shares an optimal substructure property, dynamic programming is a good way to work it out.

==Fibonacci sequence example==
In the following two implementations for calculating fibonacci sequence, codice_1 uses regular recursion and codice_2 uses memoization. codice_2 is much more efficient as the value for any particular codice_4 is computed only once. 
When executed, the codice_1 function computes the value of some of the numbers in the sequence many times over, whereas codice_2 reuses the value of codice_4 which was computed previously:
The difference in performance may appear minimal with an codice_4 value of 5; however, as codice_4 increases, the computational complexity of the original codice_1 function grows exponentially. In contrast, the codice_2 version exhibits a more linear increase in complexity.

<doc id="1180824" wikidata="Q15220388" url="?curid=1180824" title="International Association of Fire Fighters">
<text>The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) is a labor union representing paid full-time firefighters and emergency medical services personnel in the United States and Canada. The IAFF was formed in 1918 and is affiliated with the AFL–CIO in the United States and the Canadian Labour Congress in Canada. The IAFF has more than 344,440 members in its more than 3,500 affiliate organizations. Its political action committee, FIREPAC, is one of the most active PACs in the country.

==IAFF mission and history==
The IAFF was formed in 1918. The IAFF has fought for better wages, benefits, working conditions and improved safety for union members. The IAFF has also pushed for more full-time union firefighters.

==IAFF Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery==
The IAFF has announced plans to open the Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery in 2017 located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland (outside Washington, DC). The IAFF Center of Excellence is intended for union members only and will offer treatment for recovery from post-traumatic stress and co-occurring addictions in hopes to help members return to the job. The center also will serve to train and educate peer support members in the treatment of post-traumatic stress and substance abuse in the fire fighter population. The ultimate goal is to develop protocols for fire departments to use to help fire fighters.

==IAFF Legislative Conference==
Each year the IAFF hosts a national legislative conference in Washington, DC that is open to any IAFF member who wishes to register. The IAFF legislative conference is the largest legislative conference of any union in the country. Over the years, attendees have heard from President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, members of the Cabinet of both Republican and Democratic administrations, numerous members of Congress, including the Leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives, and key congressional staff.

==Membership restrictions==
IAFF as a union represents full-time paid firefighters and emergency medical technicians, and membership is not open to volunteer firefighters. Its bylaws do not allow members to work or volunteer with any other emergency service organization beyond their full-time employer, and can have their membership revoked if they do, though in practice this rarely, if ever happens.

==IAFF Fire Fighters Interested in Registration and Education Political Action Committee==
FIREPAC (Fire Fighters Interested in Registration and Education Political Action Committee) is the federally registered political action committee of the IAFF. FIREPAC was established in 1978 and has grown into the top one percent of all federally registered PACs. During the 2009 – 2010 election cycle FIREPAC raised $5.3 million and was the tenth largest PAC in terms of donations to federal candidates. Within organized labor, FIREPAC has been the most bi-partisan PAC during the last decade, contributing a larger percent of its donations to Republican candidates than any other union. The IAFF follows a simple philosophy when it supporting candidates – they support those who support fire fighters, regardless of party affiliation or political leanings.

==IAFF Charitable Foundation==
The IAFF Charitable Foundation was formed in 2011 to assist IAFF union members and their families if affected by natural disaster (including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods) promotes fire and burn prevention, advocates for fire fighter health and safety, and provides public education on how to prevent and recover from burn trauma.

==IAFF Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial==
The IAFF Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial is a permanent remembrance of IAFF members and emergency medical services personnel who have lost their lives in the line of duty. An annual Fallen Firefighters memorial ceremony is held each year in September in Colorado Springs, Colorado (with the exception of 2020 and 2021 due to the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic). More than 8,800 names of fallen IAFF members are etched on the wall.

==Muscular Dystrophy Association support==
The IAFF is the largest national sponsor of the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). Members raise funds primarily through the &quot;Fill the Boot&quot; campaign, which helps fund MDA summer camps for children, professional and public health education and other programs. Total donations since 1954 are over $558 million.

Since 1966 the International Association of Fire Fighters has appeared on and co-sponsored The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon.

<text>OnStar Corporation is a subsidiary of General Motors that provides subscription-based communications, in-vehicle security, emergency services, turn-by-turn navigation, and remote diagnostics systems throughout the United States, Canada, Chile, China, Mexico, Europe, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

A similar service known as &quot;Vauxhall/Opel OnStar&quot; was available in western Europe and &quot;ChevyStar&quot; in Latin American markets (except in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina). In September 2011 the president of OnStar stated that the service had more than six million customers. On May 9, 2018, Vauxhall Motors announced that Vauxhall OnStar, alongside Opel OnStar services, would cease to operate after December 31, 2020, following Groupe PSA&#x27;s purchase of Vauxhall Motors and Opel from General Motors.

A new aftermarket interior rear-view mirror with a built-in OnStar module, branded as OnStar FMV, became publicly available on July 24, 2011. It provides some of the features an OEM system has, such as Automatic Crash Response, Stolen Vehicle Tracking, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, and Roadside Assistance.

Ford had &quot;a similar system&quot; named RESCU and it was introduced with Ford&#x27;s 1996 Lincoln Continental. Ford&#x27;s service is now SYNC.

==Overview==

The OnStar service relied on CDMA mobile phone voice and data communication, primarily via Verizon Wireless in the United States and Bell Mobility in Canada, as well as location information using GPS technology. More recently, TELUS and Onstar announced a new arrangement in 2021 for 4G and 5G in-vehicle mobility services. Drivers and passengers can use its audio interface to contact OnStar representatives for emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions.

The OnStar service allows users to contact OnStar call centers during an emergency. In the event of a collision, detected by airbag deployment or other sensors, Advanced Automatic Collision Notification features can automatically send information about the vehicle&#x27;s condition and GPS location to OnStar call centers. OnStar has 24-hour emergency call centers in Warren, Michigan; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Ontario, Canada, and other call centers in Makati, Philippines; and Oshawa, Ontario. This Advanced Automatic Collision Notification service is designed to assist emergency response efforts.

All OnStar-equipped vehicles have Stolen Vehicle Tracking, which can provide the police with the vehicle&#x27;s exact location, speed, and direction of movement.

Starting in the 2009 model year, General Motors began equipping some new vehicles with Stolen Vehicle Slowdown. This feature allows OnStar to remotely slow down the stolen vehicle. The service is also expected to help reduce the risk of property damage, serious injuries or fatalities resulting from high-speed pursuits of stolen vehicles. Customers may opt out of that function. The first successful use of this service occurred in October 2009 when a stolen Chevrolet Tahoe was recovered and its suspected thief was apprehended.

Also in 2009, General Motors began equipping some new vehicles with Remote Ignition Block, allowing OnStar to remotely deactivate the ignition so when the stolen vehicle is shut off, it cannot be restarted.

All Stolen Vehicle Assistance services (Stolen Vehicle Tracking, Stolen Vehicle Slowdown and Remote Ignition Block) can be requested by the OnStar subscriber, but OnStar will not activate them until confirming with the police that the vehicle has been reported as stolen.

OnStar subscribers may be eligible for anti-theft and low mileage insurance discounts. Since OnStar can help with the recovery of a stolen vehicle, some insurance companies recognize this and offer a discount. Also, with certain insurance companies (for example, GMAC Insurance) and with subscriber permission, OnStar will send the insurance company the vehicle&#x27;s odometer reading every month. If the subscriber qualifies as a low-mileage driver, they may be eligible for an insurance discount.

Even if the vehicle is OnStar equipped, no OnStar services are available until the system is activated. Vehicle owners can choose between various plans:
* Connected Access: Free for 10 years: includes Vehicle Diagnostics, Dealer Maintenance Notification, Chevrolet Smart Driver, and Marketplace
* App Access: $15/mo, includes In-Vehicle Streaming Audio Apps, Alexa Built-In, and Connected Navigation
* Remote Access: $14.99/mo or $149.90/yr, includes Remote Key Fob, Family Link, On-Demand Diagnostics, Vehicle Locate, and Remote Personalization
* Onstar Guardian App: $15/mo, Take Onstar on the go. An app that supports Automatic Crash Response, Emergency Services and Roadside assistance outside an Onstar equipped vehicle
* Unlimited Access: $29.99/mo, includes all services in Remote Access, plus Alexa Built-In, Connected Navigation, and access to 4G LTE Data
* Safety &amp; Security: $29.99/mo or $299.90/yr, includes Automatic Crash Response, Emergency Services, Roadside Assistance, Crisis Alert, Stolen Vehicle Assistance, and Turn-By-Turn Navigation

* Unlimited Access + Safety &amp; Security: $49.99/mo, includes all services in the Unlimited Access and Safety &amp; Security Plans

Mobile data access in the vehicle can be added with extra service plans, provided by TELUS in Canada.

In June 2022, GM began to include a three-year, prepaid OnStar and Connected Services premium subscription as a standard option on Buick, Cadillac, and GMC models, at a value of US$1,500. This subscription is a mandatory option included in the price of the vehicle, even if the owner does not intend to use the services.

Legacy Plans no longer able to be purchased:
* Basic: Free for first 5 years, which includes Remote Access, Advanced Diagnostics and Smart Driver which provides advice on driving style
* Protection: $19.99/mo, which includes Advanced Automatic Collision Notification, Emergency Services, Crisis Assist, Roadside Assistance, Remote Access, Advanced Diagnostics and 24/7 access to Advisors

* Guidance: $34.99/mo, includes all services in the Security plan, plus turn-by-turn navigation, OnStar AtYourService, and 30 Hands-Free Calling Minutes

==History==
OnStar was formed in 1996 as a collaboration between GM, Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Electronics Corporation. Each of the founding companies brought a specific area of expertise to the enterprise: GM brought vehicle design and integration and a distribution system of millions of vehicles, EDS brought much of the systems development and information management and customer service technologies, while Hughes (creators of DirecTV) contributed communications and satellite technology and automotive electronics.

In 1996, GM North America Operations President Rick Wagoner officially launched OnStar at the Chicago Auto Show. OnStar delivered its first product and service to the market in 11 months, in the fall of 1996 for model-year 1997 Cadillac DeVille, Cadillac Seville, and Cadillac Eldorado models. From 2002 to 2006, OnStar service was available on vehicles produced by Acura, Audi, Isuzu, Subaru, and Volkswagen through a licensing agreement.

In April 2006, GM notified approximately 500,000 of their OnStar customers who had analog service that their service would be terminated effective December 31, 2007, because starting February 18, 2008 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would no longer require US cell phone systems to operate in analog mode. Customers who purchased a prepaid, non-refundable, non-transferable 1-year OnStar Safe &amp; Sound subscription were scheduled to receive an equipment upgrade. If the vehicle is from the 2003, 2004, or 2005 model year, an adapter costing approximately US$200 (includes a one-year subscription) can be installed at the customer&#x27;s expense. If it is older, it will simply no longer be usable. A law firm in Pennsylvania representing some of the affected customers sought to have a class certified for a class-action lawsuit for damages claimed in the cancellation of OnStar service.

On December 19, 2011, GM said OnStar would join with Verizon Wireless to offer video chat and streaming content to automobile passengers.

Since 2014 OnStar offers LTE Wi-Fi service on select GM cars.

Starting June 14, 2021, the OnStar Guardian app was made available to any driver in the United States or Canada. The Guardian app uses sensors in the phone, such as the accelerometer and the GPS receiver, to provide some traditional OnStar services (e.g., automatic crash notification), regardless of the vehicle in which the user is riding.

The Guardian app also serves as the user interface, via Bluetooth, to the OnStar Link plug-in device, if it is installed. OnStar Link is a miniature GPS receiver and 4G LTE IoT interface that plugs into the vehicle&#x27;s OBD-II connector. It can provide most traditional OnStar services, including a WiFi hotspot (additional data plan required), though not Stolen Vehicle Slowdown, Hands-Free Calling, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, or Send-to-Navigation. Voice communication with an OnStar Advisor requires a Bluetooth-paired cell phone.

In September 2021, GM notified owners of certain pre-2015 model-year vehicles in the United States that their factory-installed OnStar equipment will become obsolete and non-functional after December 2022. These vehicles use Verizon Wireless&#x27;s 2G/3G CDMA network for communication, and Verizon has announced plans to sunset this network. Unlike GM&#x27;s remedy under similar circumstances for Canadian customers, where the vehicle hardware was updated, customers in the United States will be provided an OnStar Link plug-in at no additional charge.

==China==
In December 2009, Shanghai OnStar Telematics Co. Ltd., a joint venture between General Motors, SAIC Group and SGM (Shanghai GM), began offering its services in China. It is available on select Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet vehicles and China Telecom is the wireless network provider throughout China. The service will be available throughout mainland China and will be first launched in Mandarin Chinese.

==Mexico==
In June 2013, OnStar announced its entry to the Mexican market. The first vehicles which obtained the system were the 2014 Chevrolet Cheyenne and the 2014 GMC Sierra. Currently it is available in nearly all of General Motors vehicles available in the country with the Chevrolet Beat, Chevrolet Aveo, Chevrolet Tornado and Chevrolet S10 being the only exceptions.

==Brazil==
OnStar is available in Brazil in the Chevrolet vehicles such as the Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet Cruze, Onix, Onix Plus and Chevrolet S-10.

==Argentina==
OnStar started operations in Argentina on May 5, 2016, with the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze being the first vehicle to include it. The same vehicle is being assembled in Rosario, Santa Fe.

==Advocacy==
Advocates promote OnStar as an essential safety tool. GM commercials have compared it to seatbelts and airbags, as the next major technology for safe driving. The benefits, they say, include its ability to aid police in tracking down stolen vehicles; contacting emergency medical services in case of an accident (should the driver request this or be non-responsive); notifying drivers of potentially dangerous mechanical problems; emails are sent to owners that give a diagnostics of their vehicle every month if subscribed to; and unlocking doors for drivers (after verifying authorization over the phone) should their keys be misplaced or locked inside their car. OnStar&#x27;s basic subscription also includes Roadside assistance, as well HFC (Hands Free Calling) which is integrated into the OnStar system and operates in the same way as a regular cell phone does except that it is operated through voice recognition. Automatic Crash Response allows emergency advisors to provide emergency medical services (EMS) with additional crash information such as rollover status, direction of impact, which airbags have deployed (front, side etc.,) and the Delta-V (change in velocity) Force which is a medical measure of the intensity of an impact. All this information allows EMS to respond to the crash with appropriate equipment.

In September 2011, OnStar has changed its terms and conditions to allow sale of vehicle location and speeds to interested third parties including law enforcement agencies, which has been criticized in the comp.risks forum.

==Use as surveillance device==
OnStar is theoretically susceptible to remote activation by malicious third parties or government agencies. This activation would enable third parties to track the location of the car, along with the ability to listen to the contents of any conversations carried on by the occupants within the car without their consent. However, the FBI has denied the ability to use this as it disables OnStar&#x27;s safety features, as determined by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In its document of privacy practices, OnStar states that it is not possible for them to listen to or monitor conversations in a car without the knowledge of the occupant. The hardware is designed so that when an advisor calls into a car, a light flashes, a ring tone is heard, and the radio will mute.

In 2011, OnStar said that it would start retaining all the information collected by the GPS and internal system so that it could be sold to third parties (possibly insurance companies). Although this data is supposed to be &quot;anonymized&quot;, exactly what OnStar means by anonymizing GPS data remains unclear, and it may be impossible to make the data actually anonymous. A few weeks later, after outcry from subscribers and privacy advocate groups, OnStar reversed the decision to continue collecting information from unsubscribed units.

A 2019 experiment hacking into the data collected by a 2017 Chevrolet Volt revealed that the car stored logs of calls made from the user&#x27;s cell phone, as well as location and driving data, which could then be sold to third parties.

==Advertising campaign==
In 2000, GM produced a series of Batman OnStar commercials that featured Batman (using the Batmobile and props from the 1989 film) using the service to call people, access his mail, navigate to certain locations, and to unlock the Batmobile. These were discontinued with radio commercials.

GM promoted the service with radio commercials (called &quot;Real Calls&quot;) demonstrating how it would work. It provided the recording of someone interacting with OnStar in various scenarios designed to show its utility. The commercials stated that these were recordings of actual instances of customers using the services, and gave the date on which they occurred.

From 2004 to 2009, OnStar was a sponsor for guest appearances on ESPN Radio programming, dubbed the &quot;OnStar Hotline&quot;.

In September 2010 under then-President Chris Preuss, OnStar relaunched its brand with a series of commercials with the theme of &quot;Live On&quot;. According to Chief Marketing Officer Sam Mancuso, the campaign was designed to change how people view OnStar, &quot;It&#x27;s not about waiting for something to happen but something people can use every day.&quot;

From 2008, OnStar has offered &quot;Santa tracking&quot; in all equipped vehicles around the festive period. This has allowed children worldwide to see Santa&#x27;s location on Christmas Eve. Each time this feature is used, OnStar also made donations to various charities.

==Hardware==
GM is currently deploying OnStar Generation 10 hardware that includes enhanced services and diagnostics and the ability to use the mobile application RemoteLink, which allows a subscriber to perform many functions without the need for calling into the OnStar center. Functions include remote start, remote lock and unlock, flashing lights and horn as well as viewing up-to-date diagnostics data from the subscriber&#x27;s iPhone or Android-powered mobile phone. As of 2011 OnStar hardware is currently only manufactured by LG Electronics, although early models were made by Hughes for Gen 1, Delphi for Gen 2, and Motorola for Gen 4 to Gen 6.

===Analog===
The Gen 1 to Gen 4 models were analog. All were for Class 2 bus. Gen 5 models were a transition period. Some Gen 5 models actually contained both analog and digital cellular phone modules. Also, there were both Class 2 and CAN bus models.

===Digital===
The Gen 6 and up models are CDMA digital. Some were Class 2 bus and some were CAN (Controller Area Network) bus.

===Compatibility===
Some Gen 5 and Gen 6 models were compatible with each other providing some upgrades to some customers to digital. Analog cellular was turned off in February 2008. Customers who had the Gen 1 through Gen 4 models were unable to upgrade to the digital Gen 6.

There is no compatibility in Gen 1 and 4 with other models, while there is some compatibility with Gen 2 and Gen 2.6 (Delphi TCU and Motorola cellular transceiver).

===OnStar FMV (For My Vehicle)===

In 2011, OnStar introduced the OnStar FMV system. The system, which embedded both the OnStar system, as well as Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, into an automatically dimming rear view mirror that replaced the existing rear view mirror in nearly any vehicle that was not equipped from the factory with the OnStar system. The system was able to provide all of the features of OnStar, except for those services which required integration of the vehicle&#x27;s computer (such as Stolen Vehicle Slowdown and Automatic Airbag Deployment Notification). Instead, the system included sensors that detected irregular movement of the mirror and triggered a call to the OnStar emergency response center. Wireless service was provided through Verizon Wireless. The system was compatible with most vehicles manufactured from model year 2000 to 2014, as long as the vehicle was not equipped from the factory with the OnStar system, however, OnStar noted that the system &quot;should not be installed in vehicles such as the Jeep Wrangler, Toyota FJ Cruiser, Hummer, Recreational Vehicle (RV&#x27;s), or Semi Truck&quot; due to the &quot;extreme windshield angles and/or excessive size&quot; and therefore had the &quot;inability to detect a crash&quot;. Professional installation from an OnStar FMV retailer, such as select automotive dealerships and electronic retailers (such as Best Buy), was recommended. An annual OnStar subscription for the FMV cost US$299.00.

On March 3, 2014, OnStar announced that they would be discontinuing production and sales of the OnStar FMV system. While not citing a reason for the discontinuation of the FMV, OnStar said that they &quot;have gained a number of key insights by launching OnStar FMV that will be very valuable as (we) investigate future ventures in the retail space&quot;. However, owners of the OnStar FMV would continue to receive service for their device as long as they continued to subscribe. Similar services are offered from the factory on more vehicles, with the initial service cost being included for a trial period, as well as offering more features, such as in-vehicle Wi-Fi connectivity via 3G or 4G LTE, enhanced accident response systems, remote ignition disabling, and remote control services of the vehicle.

==Vulnerability to hacking==
On July 30, 2015, Samy Kamkar introduced OwnStar - a small electronic device that could be concealed on or near a General Motors vehicle to interpose itself between the vehicle&#x27;s OnStar link and the driver&#x27;s OnStar RemoteLink app. In this classic man-in-the-middle attack, Kamkar, or any unauthorized user, could substitute his OnStar commands to locate, unlock, or start the vehicle. By August 11, General Motors had released upgrades to the OnStar server software and RemoteLink app to block such attacks.

==Discontinuation of CDMA Service==

Following the announcement that Verizon Wireless would no longer provide 2G or 3G CDMA cellular service after 2022, OnStar has announced that all OnStar-equipped General Motors vehicles built prior to the 2015 model year, as well as select 2015 and newer General Motors vehicles not equipped with the newer 4G LTE service provided by AT&amp;T, will lose access to OnStar services by the end of the year. Customers who subscribe to OnStar services will continue to receive the services until the end of 2022, and new subscribers will not be able to activate their OnStar services. Affected customers with pre-2015 model year certain vehicles will be able to obtain an OBD II adapter that will provide 4G LTE cellular service for select OnStar services that are accessible via the OnStar mobile application (such as unlocking and locking the vehicle&#x27;s doors, and locating the vehicle via Global Positioning System), however, will no longer be able to access OnStar services such as Destination Download (the ability to send a GPS destination directly to the vehicle&#x27;s OnStar system, or, if equipped, the GPS navigation system, from a smartphone or computer) and emergency services. The 4G LTE adapter will also provide a wireless Wi-Fi Internet connection, similar to that of the embedded OnStar systems found in newer General Motors vehicles. Owners of certain vehicles not compatible with the 4G LTE adapter will lose access to all OnStar services, though they will be able to download the OnStar Guardian mobile application onto their iOS or Android smartphone that will provide similar functionality to their vehicle&#x27;s CDMA-based OnStar system.

OnStar has also announced that, effective February, 2022, the built-in hands-free cellular telephone functionality, which allowed drivers to make and receive voice-activated, hands-free phone calls over their vehicle&#x27;s car audio system, and assigned the vehicle a unique telephone number, will be discontinued, citing the increased popularity of Bluetooth connectivity in most vehicles. This affects all OnStar-equipped vehicles, regardless of cellular technology or model year.

Certain early AT&amp;T 4G LTE-equipped OnStar vehicles will be required to install a Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) software update that will allow their vehicles to connect to an updated 4G LTE cellular network. Affected vehicles must have active OnStar services in order to install the software update.

<doc id="1180829" wikidata="Q2871297" url="?curid=1180829" title="Auguste Louis Albéric d'Arenberg">
<text>Auguste Louis Albéric, Prince of Arenberg GCSI (15 September 1837 – 24 January 1924) was a French noble and monarchist politician, 2nd (French) Duke of Arenberg. He was noted for his great wealth and extensive properties throughout France, in particular at Menetou-Salon (Cher).

==Early life==
The Prince of Arenberg was born in Paris on 15 September 1837. He was the third son of Pierre d&#x27;Alcantara Charles Marie, duc d&#x27;Arenberg (1790–1877) and Alix Marie Charlotte de Talleyrand-Périgord (1808–1842). His father was made a peer of France in 1827 and became a naturalized French subject by order of King Charles X in 1828. Because both of his older brothers died prematurely, he inherited his father&#x27;s title. His elder sister Marie Nicolette was married to Charles de Mérode, 10th Marquess of Westerloo. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1842, his father remarried to Caroline Léopoldine Jeanne, Princess of Kaunitz-Rietberg-Questenberg, in 1860.

His paternal grandfather was Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg and his uncle was Prosper Louis, 7th Duke of Arenberg.

==Career==
Arenberg served in the Chamber of Deputies from 1877 to 1881. He was elected as the official candidate of the MacMahon government, winning the poll due to the abstention of republican voters disenchanted with his predecessor. In the Chamber, he voted consistently with the monarchist Right and conservatives. He voted against the legalization of divorce.

Returned to parliament as a monarchist candidate again in 1889, Arenberg continued his opposition to republican government. After Rerum novarum and Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s recognition of the Third Republic, however, Arenberg changed his rhetoric, campaigning in 1893 as a &quot;liberal republican&quot;. In the Chamber, he concentrated on colonial issues, in particular those concerning Africa; among his projects were securing free navigation of the Niger River and delineating Anglo-French colonial boundaries.

Defeated in the 1902 elections and failing to secure reelection again in 1906, Arenberg retired from politics, but remained active in public life. He was the first president of the procolonial Comité de l&#x27;Afrique française and remained active with the organization until his death.

===Later life===
A convinced Catholic himself, during 1895 he was one of the organizers of a failed attempt to build a mosque in Paris through private donations. From 1896 he was also president of the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez, and he was a member of the Institut de France (Académie des beaux-arts) from 1897.

==Personal life==
On 18 June 1868, Arenberg was married to Jeanne Marie Louise de Greffulhe (1850–1891). She was a daughter of Count Louis-Charles Greffulhe and Félicité Pauline de La Rochefoucauld and sister of Henry Greffulhe (a personal friend of author Marcel Proust). They were the parents of four children:

* Alix Jeanne Marie d&#x27;Arenberg (1869–1924), who married Pierre Adolphe, Marquis de Laguiche, a descendant of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon.
* Charles-Louis Pierre d&#x27;Arenberg (1871–1919), who married Antoinette Hélène Emma Louise de Gramont de Lesparre (1883–1958), a granddaughter of Agénor, 10th Duke of Gramont and cousin of Armand de Gramont, 12th Duke of Gramont.
* Louise Marie Charlotte d&#x27;Arenberg (1872–1958), who married Louis Antoine Melchior, Marquis de Vogüé.
* Ernest Hélie Charles Marie (1886–1915), who died during World War I.

The Prince died on 24 January 1924.

===Descendants===
Through his son Charles, he was a grandfather of Prince Charles Auguste Armand d&#x27;Arenberg (1905–1967),3rd (French) Duke, who married American heiress Margaret (née Bedford) Bancroft in 1960. They were the parents of one son, Prince Pierre Frederick Henri d&#x27;Arenberg (b. 1961), 4th (French) Duke, before his death in 1967. She remarried to Emmanuel Jacques de Crussol, Duke d&#x27;Uzès.

<text>A frontlight is a means of illuminating a display device, usually a liquid crystal display (LCD), which would otherwise be viewed in ambient light. This improves its performance in poor lighting conditions.

An LCD presents an image by absorbing some light passing through it. When an electric field is applied across the crystal, it changes the passing light so it will not pass through a polarization filter. This allows LCDs to operate at low power, as no energy needs to be spent generating light. Many battery-operated electronic devices, including most calculators and other devices use unilluminated LCDs.

An unilluminated LCD must be lit from the front. To use ambient light, the liquid crystal itself is sandwiched between a polarization filter and a reflective surface. The mirror makes the display opaque so it cannot be illuminated from the back. Most often a light source is placed around the perimeter of the LCD.

The frontlight has found a place among devices using E Ink displays such as E-readers. In an effort to make these devices look like paper some trade offs are made, one of the drawbacks is that they don&#x27;t produce light, so you can&#x27;t read when in dark areas. And you can&#x27;t put the light behind it and call it a Backlight because the display is opaque. The solution; the frontlight, also sometimes marketed as a &quot;reading light&quot; in order to appeal to the non-nerd as seen in the ReMarkable Paper Pro.

Frontlights are relatively uncommon overall. Electroluminescent lights present a reflective surface when turned off. This allows for a backlit display which can also be used with ambient light. Such backlights are popular in digital watches. The monochromatic light from an electroluminescent source does not work well with color displays, however. An incandescent frontlight was therefore a popular accessory for the Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy line up until the first model of the Game Boy Advance; the Game Boy Advance SP introduced a frontlight, which made external lights redundant.

<text>Christoph von Dohnányi (; born 8 September 1929) is a German conductor.

==Biography==

=== Youth and World War II ===
Dohnányi was born in Berlin, Germany to Hans von Dohnanyi, a German jurist of Hungarian ancestry, and Christine Bonhoeffer. His uncle on his mother&#x27;s side, and also his godfather, was Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a Lutheran pastor and theologian/ethicist. His grandfather was the pianist and composer Ernő Dohnányi, also known as Ernst von Dohnányi. His father, uncle and other family members participated in the German Resistance movement against Nazism, and were arrested and detained in several Nazi concentration camps before being executed in 1945, when Christoph was 15 years old. Dohnányi&#x27;s older brother is Klaus von Dohnanyi, a German politician and former mayor of Hamburg.

===Education and early engagements===
After World War II, Dohnányi studied law in Munich, but in 1948 he transferred to the &quot;Hochschule für Musik und Theater München&quot; to study composition, piano and conducting. At the opera in Munich, he was a stage extra, coached singers, and was a house pianist. He received the Richard Strauss Prize from the city of Munich, and then went to Florida State University to study with his grandfather.

His first position as assistant was at the Oper Frankfurt, appointed by Georg Solti, where he also served as a ballet and opera coach. He was general musical director of the Lübeck Opera from 1957 to 1963, then Germany&#x27;s youngest GMD. He also served as chief conductor of the Staatsorchester Kassel. He also served as chief conductor of the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne. In 1968, he succeeded Lovro von Matačić who had succeeded Georg Solti as general music director and Dohnányi later became also musical director at the Oper Frankfurt and served in both capacities until 1977. He took the positions of intendant and chief conductor with the Hamburg State Opera in 1977, and relinquished those posts in 1984.

As director of the Oper Frankfurt and with his team including Gerard Mortier (Director of Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, Salzburg Festival, Opéra de Paris), Peter Mario Katona (Director of Casting at ROH Covent Garden) and Klaus Schultz, Dramaturg in Munich (Bayerische Staatsoper) and Berlin (Philharmonic Orchestra), then General Manager of the Stadttheater Aachen, Nationaltheater Mannheim, and Gärtnerplatztheater in Munich, the balance in programming of traditional opera performance and innovative Musiktheater, promoting the idea of Regietheater, established the Oper Frankfurt as a leading house at that time. He continued this concept in Hamburg.

===Cleveland years===
Christoph von Dohnányi made his conducting debut with The Cleveland Orchestra in December 1981 and was named “Music Director Designate” the following year. However, he would not begin his tenure as music director until 1984. During the intervening two years, the Orchestra invited a number of guest conductors to lead the ensemble, including former music director Erich Leinsdorf for six weeks of subscription concerts. Leinsdorf would remark that he was the &quot;bridge between the regimes.&quot; Before taking the podium as the Orchestra’s sixth music director, Dohnányi made guest appearances with other American orchestras, including those in Detroit, Pittsburgh, and New York, as well as leading The Cleveland Orchestra in its annual gala concert and recordings at Severance Hall. As Dohnányi began his first season as music director, he brought with him contacts that would push the Orchestra forward with a variety of recording projects. Near the end of the 1984–85 season, Dohnányi announced an ambitious idea: The Cleveland Orchestra would use its summer home, Blossom Music Center, to perform a fully-staged opera: Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. The production, which was attended by 15,000 people, was labeled &quot;the Ohio musical event of the summer&quot; by &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. Dohnányi also oversaw the hiring of Indonesian-born conductor Jahja Ling, who would lead the newly-established Cleveland Orchestra Youth Orchestra, which had its first concert in February 1987.

In addition to making recording a hallmark of his tenure as music director through the Orchestra&#x27;s ongoing association with several labels (Teldec, Decca/London, and Telarc), Dohnányi focused much of his attention on international touring. In 1986, the Orchestra embarked on its sixth tour of Europe and its first international tour under Dohnányi, performing twenty-one concerts in seventeen cities across Western Europe. Not only would the Orchestra continue with international touring to Europe or East Asia nearly every season, it would also embark on tours of European festivals, including the Salzburg Festival, where the Orchestra’s long-standing relationship would begin after a performance in 1990. Because of the departure or retirement of several musicians between 1988 and 1990, Dohnányi was tasked with hiring new Orchestra members, including a replacement for Robert Page, who had been the longtime director of the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus. Furthermore, Leonard Slatkin, the former music director of the St. Louis Symphony, was appointed Blossom Festival Director beginning in the summer of 1991.

To celebrate The Cleveland Orchestra’s 75th anniversary, Dohnányi led performances of Richard Wagner’s Ring cycle at Severance Hall during the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. Although the ensemble’s intention was to become the first symphony orchestra in the United States to record the four-opera, fifteen-hour musical monument, financial restrictions limited the Orchestra to recording only the first two operas — &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;.

In 1992, Dohnányi signed a new contract that extended his tenure as music director through the 1999–2000 season. A few years later, the Orchestra began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of Severance Hall, which included the replacement of the “Szell Shell,” a return of the E.M. Skinner organ to the stage, and an expansion of internal facilities to enhance the experience of concertgoers. Dohnányi signed his final contract as music director with the Orchestra in 1997, extending his tenure until 2002.

As international touring continued, the Orchestra visited the People’s Republic of China for the first time in 1998. During the spring of 1999, the Orchestra moved to Cleveland’s Playhouse Square for a residency at the Allen Theatre until the renovation of Severance Hall was completed. On January 8, 2000, Dohnányi led a gala concert to celebrate the re-opening of Severance Hall, which was broadcast live on local television by Cleveland’s WVIZ. Following his contract&#x27;s expiration, Dohnányi was named Music Director Laureate of The Cleveland Orchestra.

=== After Cleveland ===
In 1994, Dohnányi became the principal guest conductor of London&#x27;s Philharmonia Orchestra, and in 1997 their Principal Conductor. In April 2007, Dohnányi was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the 10-year classical music outreach manifesto, &quot;Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st Century&quot;, to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. In 2008, he stepped down from the Philharmonia principal conductorship and now holds the title with the orchestra of &quot;Honorary Conductor for Life&quot;.

After retiring as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, Dohnányi has been a guest conductor with the Boston Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony, Chicago Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic, as well as the Cleveland Orchestra. He has performed frequently at the Tanglewood Music Festival with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. A regular collaboration has developed with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra since the 1990s.

In 2004, Dohnányi returned to Hamburg, Germany where he maintained a residence for many years, to become chief conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra. He concluded his NDR tenure after the 2009–2010 season. He has been a frequent guest conductor in concert with the Vienna Philharmonic and at the Vienna State Opera.

With the Philharmonia Orchestra, Dohnányi performed throughout Europe at such venues as the Musikverein in Vienna, the Salzburg Festival, Amsterdam&#x27;s Concertgebouw, the Lucerne Festival, and Paris&#x27;s Théâtre des Champs Elysées. For several seasons, Dohnányi and the Philharmonia Orchestra were in residence at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, performing new productions of Richard Strauss&#x27;s operas &quot;Arabella&quot;, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; and &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot;, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;. At the Opernhaus Zürich, Dohnányi led new productions of &quot;Moses and Aron&quot;, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (with Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;), Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Schweigsame Frau&quot;, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Elektra&quot;, and &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot;, and Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;.

===Assistants to Christoph von Dohnányi ===
Michael Stern, music director and lead conductor of the Kansas City Symphony, was assistant conductor to Dohnányi from 1986 to 1991 at the Cleveland Orchestra.
Alan Gilbert, former music director of the New York Philharmonic, was assistant conductor to Dohnányi from 1995 to 1997 at the Cleveland Orchestra. Alejo Pérez was assistant conductor at the NDR Symphony Orchestra from 2005 to 2007 and Jens Georg Bachmann, Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra was in the same position at the NDR Symphony Orchestra from 2007 to 2009.

=== Family ===
Dohnányi was married to the German actress Renate Zillessen; they had two children, Katja and Justus. His second wife was the German soprano Anja Silja, with whom he had three children: Julia, Benedikt and Olga. Since 2004 Dohnányi has been married to Barbara Koller.

<doc id="1180858" wikidata="Q720627" url="?curid=1180858" title="Kanhangad">
<text>Kanhangad () is a commercial city, located in the Kasaragod District, state of Kerala, India.

== Location ==
The area contains villages around Kanhangad town with Kasaragod as the northern border, Nileshwar, popularly known as the &#x27;cultural town&#x27; of Kasaragod district with its rich rivers and lakes; as the southern boundary. The eastern part of Kanhangad is categorized as Panathur area with the difference in terrain mainly because of the hilly terrain and hill stations and to the West lies the Arabian Sea.
The importance of Kanhangad is that it lies in the exact centre between the two major cities Mangalore and Kannur, equidistant from their respective district headquarters.

== Geography ==
Kanhangad lies at 12°18′0″N 75°5.4′0″E in the geographic map of Kasaragod. It is a coastal town which has a varied topography with plain areas in the centre of the city. The landscape is dominated by the characteristic coconut palms accompanying rolling hills and streams flowing into the sea. In the East, there are hilly areas of Madikai . The western region has powdered sand and a mix of laterite and alluvial soil in the areas between. The hilly areas typically consists of red sand.

The Arabian Sea lies in the west and Western Ghats in the east. The Neeleshwaram River originates from the Kinanoor hills, passes south through Arangadi and drains into the Nileshwar .

==Etymology==
As cited in the &quot;Vadakkan Paattu&quot; or the North Malabar folklore songs, there was a temple in the name of &quot;Kanjiram Kaattappan&quot; and through this the name Kanjangad was derived. Another popular belief is that it was derived out of &quot;Kānjiramkād&quot; which means a forest of Strychnine tree. As per historic records, the place was ruled by &quot;Kanjan&quot;, a tribal representative of Kolathiri which later came to be known as &quot;Kanjante naad&quot; which means &#x27;land of Kanjan&#x27; in Malayalam; later constricted as Kanhangad. There is also another legend that the name was derived from a Sanskrit word &quot;Kanchanaghatta&quot;.

==History==
It was cited in old folklore that the area of Kanhangad was under the reign of king Nanda Raja of Mushaka Rajya, headquartered in Ezhimala Kannur region during the Sangam period. The historic region was known as &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; and later &quot;Paduvanadu&quot;. However, the history of Kanhangad can be clearly understood only by the 8th century. During this period the area was a part of the 2nd Chera Dynasty. The illustrations of a Chera King, Bhaskaran Ravi Varman II obtained from Pullur shows the political sovereignty of the Chera Kingdom in this region.

Later, when Kolathunadu of Kolathiri dynasty from Kannur administered the region, Kolathiri appointed Kanhan as the baron of the region. So the name &quot;Kanhante Naadu&quot;, meaning &#x27;Kanhan&#x27;s Province&#x27; contracted to Kanhangad.

Due to the collapse of the Kolathiri Dynasty, the reign of &quot;Elamkoor&quot; came to an end and the powerful elite barons renowned as &quot;Ettadukkal lords&quot; gained the strength. Among them, the mightiest was Allohalan, whose reign was concentrated around Madiyan Kovilakam. With the help of the Zamorin, Kolathiri has assassinated him and established a new dynasty at Neeleswaram headquarters. Earlier Kanhangad was a crucial port in all sense. Hence the Vijayanagara kings attacked Kanhangad too during their conquest of Tulu Nadu. After the fall of the Vijayanagara dynasty, the Ikkeri Kings have been attacking this area since the 1630s.

Since Kanhangad became a part of Nileshwaram kingdom following the reign of the Kolathunadu, the land witnessed frequent conflicts between Nileshwaram kingdom and Ikkeri Nayaks of Bednore. When the Ikkeri Nayaks defeated the Nileshwaram kingdom, the region came under the Keladi Nayaka Kingdom. In 1713 Somashekara Nayaka constructed a new fort to resist further attacks from Nileshwaram kingdom. The fort is now known as Puthiyakotta or Hosdurg, meaning &#x27;New Fort&#x27; in Malayalam and Kannada respectively.

In the 1760s Haidar Ali captured the land from Ikkeri Nayaks and the region came under the Mysore Kingdom which was later merged with the south Kanara district. In 1799, soon after the death of Tipu Sultan the entire region came under the control of East India Company. Till 1862, Kanhangad was in Bekal Taluk under Bombay Presidency. On 15 April 1862 when the Dakshina Kannada region shifted to Madras Presidency, the region came under Kasaragod taluk. After the formation of Kerala State, Kasaragod taluk was divided and Kanhangad came under Hosdurg taluk on 1 January 1957.

==Politics==
Kanhangad was an important centre of the Indian National movement. The Congress Working Committee joined at Kanhangad on 1 January 1925 and decided to launch a massive Khadi centre. It has given good direction to the freedom struggle in addition to the increase in the enthusiasm which the promotion of Khaadi had. In January 1925, the Hosdurg unit of the Indian National Congress was formed. AC Kannan Nair was the first President and KT Kunhiraman Nambiar was the first Secretary.

Many members of the &quot;Janmis&quot; or Noblemen and ordinary people from this region attended the Simon Commission for boycotting and Civil Disobedience movement. In April 1926, Vidwan P. Kelu Nair setup the Vighyanadayini National Sanskrit School in Vellikoth (Bellikoth) to promote National education. Later the school became the main centre of the National Movement in the region. The prominent Congress leaders like AC Kannan Nair, KT Kunhiraman Nambiar, Damodara Bhaktan, Vidwan P Kelunayar and E Raghava Panikkar were the teachers in this school. Keralite K. Madhavan and Gandhi Krishnan Nair were students here.

In 1930, five people participated in the Salt Satyagraha protest under the leadership of K. Kelappan. There was active participation of people from Kanhangad in the 1921 Guruvayoor Satyagraha and the 1942 Quit India Movement.

AC. Kannan Nair who was the Congress president of Hosdurg Thaluk in 1925 has fought against untouchability. He also started the Vallabhai Library in Kottacherry which helped the National movement a lot in the region.

<text>Colonel John Cridlan Barrett VC, TD (10 August 1897 – 7 March 1977) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Barrett was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1/5th Battalion, The Leicestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 September 1918 at Pontruet, France, during an attack, owing to the darkness and smoke barrage, Lieutenant Barrett found himself advancing towards a trench containing numerous machine-guns. He at once collected all available men and charged the nearest group of guns and in spite of being wounded, gained the trench, personally disposing of two machine-guns and inflicting many casualties. Notwithstanding a second wound he then climbed out of the trench to fix his position and locate the enemy, then ordered his men to cut their way back to the battalion, which they did. He was again wounded, very seriously.

He later became a surgeon at Leicester Royal Infirmary and achieved the rank of colonel after serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War II.

==Medal==
His VC is on display at the Royal Leicestershire Regiment Museum Collection in the Newarke Houses Museum, Leicester.

<doc id="1180871" wikidata="Q1360145" url="?curid=1180871" title="Marin Preda">
<text>Marin Preda (; 5 August 1922, Siliștea Gumești, Teleorman County, Kingdom of Romania – 16 May 1980, Mogoșoaia, Ilfov County], Socialist Republic of Romania) was a Romanian novelist, post-war writer and director of Cartea Românească publishing house. He is considered by some to be the most important novelist in post-World War II Romanian literature. However, he has also garnered an ambivalent perception in post-socialist Romania: Preda&#x27;s final novel, &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; (&quot;The Most Beloved of Earthlings&quot;&quot;),&quot; published just a couple of months before his death, is a daring critique of the beginnings of communism in Romania; in contrast, Preda was well-regarded by party leaders and received high distinctions in socialist Romania, and did not position himself as an open opponent of the regime. At the time of his death, Marin Preda was a member of the Great National Assembly.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood ===
Preda was born in Teleorman County in a village called Siliștea Gumești, the son of Tudor Călărașu, a ploughman, and Joița Preda. He legally bore his mother&#x27;s name, as his parents were not legally married due to the fact that Joița was a war widow, and a second marriage would annul her pension.

Joița had two daughters from her first marriage: Măria (nicknamed Alboaica) and Mița (Tita). Tudor Călărașu was also a widower, and had three sons from his first marriage: Ilie (Paraschiv), Gheorghe (Achim) and Ion (Nilă). In the family of the two spouses were also born: Ilinca, Marin and Alexandru (Sae).

Marin Preda spent his childhood in this large and rural family which — despite owning two plots of land — did not have financial security.

=== Education ===
In September 1929, the teacher Ionel Teodorescu enrolled Marin Preda in the first grade, but Preda&#x27;s father did not let him attend, as he usually enrolled his children only at the age of 8. The following year, Preda was re-enrolled in the first grade in his native village. Due to the family&#x27;s rural lifestyle, Preda participated in agricultural work at home, which meant that he was often absent from school. Gradually, however, he proved to be among the best students in his grade, and was awarded for his academic success (this childhood scene was later evoked in his novel &quot;Moromeții&quot;).

The year 1933–1934 (4th grade) was one of the hardest in the student&#x27;s life: his father could no longer buy textbooks and came down with malaria. Due to the intervention of a teacher, Preda was lent books and was able to complete the school year. When he could not find school supplies in his village, he borrowed textbooks from the neighbouring communes. With repeated pleas and insistence, he obtained a promise from his mother that she would convince his father to send him to a teaching academy.

Between 1934 and 1937 he attended grades five to seven, being taught by Ion Georgescu from the neighbouring village of Balaci. The teacher would remember in his old age that the student Marin Preda &quot;was a dreamer in the classroom&quot;, but that &quot;he did well in writing&quot;, and that on a given topic about the Union of Principalities Preda did &quot;sensational work&quot;.

He finished 7th grade with an overall average of 9.78. Preda&#x27;s final graduating exam was taken at the Central School in Ciolănești (a commune ten kilometres away from Siliștea Gumești). On 18 June, Preda was issued graduation certificate no. 71, with a general average of 9.15 in all classes.

=== Leaving his native village ===
In 1937, avoiding the Teacher Training School in Alexandria, where the fees were too high, Preda instead sought to attend school in Câmpulung-Muscel, but was rejected at the medical examination due to myopia. His father then tried to send him to a trade school; however, a librarian, Constantin Păun from Miroși, intervened and sent Preda to school in Abrud, where he received a successful grade of 10 in the scholarship examination. Preda soon integrated into daily life at a pedagogical institute. The teaches were satisfied with him and he got along well with his Transylvanian colleagues; in 1939 he spent the winter holiday with a colleague from Abrud.

In the autumn of 1939 he was transferred to a school in Cristur-Odorhei, where he continued his studies for another year. As with Abrud, he showed a special interest in history, Romanian, and mathematics. At the meetings of the Literary Society in the school, he was noticed by the teacher Justin Salanțiu, who predicted that &quot;he will become a great writer&quot;. While in the Literary Society he wrote and read some short sketches, which were chosen for publication in his school&#x27;s literary magazine; however, due to changing political circumstances in Romania, the magazine shut down and his writings went unpublished. The three years of Transylvanian life were later evoked in the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Viața ca o pradă&quot; (&quot;Life as Prey&quot;) and in &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; (&quot;The Most Beloved of Earthlings&quot;). In 1940, following the Second Vienna Award, which transferred parts of Transylvania to Hungary, Preda began to attend school in Bucharest.

In January 1941 he witnessed the turbulent events of the Legionary Rebellion and its repression by Ion Antonescu. He kept contact with Transylvanian refugees and met with soldiers settled in Bucharest. Three decades later, he would recount these events in &quot;Viața ca o pradă&quot; and &quot;Delirul&quot; (&quot;The Delirium&quot;).

At the end of the 1940–1941 school year, with help of the school&#x27;s headmaster, he took the skills examination, but due to material difficulties he dropped out of school.

During the summer, Preda did not return to his native village: &quot;I had the impression that if I return, I will not be able to leave.&quot; He had failed to publish anything and not even found a job, Marin Preda found increasingly difficult: &quot;It is impossible for me to remember and understand how I was able to live, from what sources, all autumn and all winter of 1941 -1942. Only unrelated, unnatural things ... I had nowhere to sleep, there was sleet all over Bucharest, and I walked non-stop by tram from Gara de Nord to Gara de Est. All day and all night.&quot; Sometimes he visited his brother Nilă, in a tiny attic where &quot;he was lost for hours, with his elbows under his neck.&quot;

In the collected volume of poems &quot;Sârmă ghimpată&quot; (&quot;Barbed Wire&quot;), Romanian poet Geo Dumitrescu intended to include Preda&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Return of the Wandering Son&quot;, but the collection was banned from print. In 1941, also through Geo Dumitrescu, Preda was hired as a proofreader for the newspaper &quot;Timpul&quot;.

== Literary activity ==
In April 1942, Preda made his publishing debut with the sketch &quot;Părlitu&quot; (&quot;Burnt&quot;) in the newspaper &quot;Timpul,&quot; endorsed by the poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu. His debut at the age of 20 gave him confidence in his writing, and he continued to publish sketches and stories, including &quot;Strigoaica&quot; (&quot;The Undead&quot;&quot;&quot;), &quot;Salcâmul&quot; (&quot;The Acacia&quot;&quot;&quot;), &quot;Calul&quot; (&quot;The Horse&quot;&quot;&quot;), &quot;Noaptea&quot; (&quot;&quot;T&quot;he Night&quot;&quot;&quot;), and &quot;La câmp&quot; (&quot;In the Field&quot;).

In September, Preda resigned from his proofreading position at &quot;Timpul&quot;. For a short time he was a civil servant at the Institute of Statistics. On the recommendation of critic Eugen Lovinescu, the poet Ion Vinea hired him as editorial secretary at the newspaper &quot;Evenimentul zilei&quot; (&quot;Today&#x27;s Event&quot;).

In March 1943, he wrote a column for the newspaper &quot;Vremea războiului&quot; (&quot;The Time of War&quot;). That April, &quot;Evenimentul zilei&quot; published his sketch &quot;Rotila&quot;. Preda took part in several meetings of the &quot;Sburătorul&quot; (&quot;The Flier&quot;&quot;) literary circle, led by Eugen Lovinescu, where his short story &quot;Calul&quot;&quot; produced a vivid impression, arousing the delight of Dinu Nicodin, who purchased the manuscript for a large sum of money. The short story was included in Preda&#x27;s debut volume, &quot;Întâlnirea din pământuri&quot; (&quot;The Meeting between the Lands&quot;), published in 1948. The volume hinted at Preda&#x27;s defining use of autobiographical, &quot;fly on the wall&quot; narratives: in the eponymous short story, critics immediately recognized the author&#x27;s father, who would also appear with a changed name in &quot;Moromeții&quot;.

Between 1943 and 1945 he served in the Romanian Army, an experience he would describe in his later works. In 1945 he became a proofreader for the newspaper &quot;România liberă&quot; (&quot;Free Romania&quot;).

Between 1949 and 1955, he wrote the first volume of the novel &quot;Moromeții,&quot; that would later be considered his defining work.

In 1952 he became editor of the magazine &quot;Viaţa Românească&quot; (&quot;Romanian Life&quot;). In 1956 he received the State Prize for Literature for the novel &quot;Moromeții.&quot; A year later, in 1957, Preda travelled to Vietnam and Beijing, China.

Between 1960 and 1961 he read widely, and undertook translations of foreign literature into Romanian. Preda became fascinated by William Faulkner, with whom his prose has certain affinities. In 1965, he and his wife Eta translated the novel &quot;The Plague&quot; by Albert Camus into Romanian. In 1968 he was elected the vice president of the Romanian Writers&#x27; Union, and in 1970 he became director of the Cartea Românească (&quot;Romanian Book&quot;) publishing house, which he led until his sudden death in 1980. In 1970 he translated Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Demons&quot; in collaboration with Nicolae Gane. Preda&#x27;s novel, &quot;Marele singuratic&quot; (&quot;The Great Lonely One&quot;), received the Writers&#x27; Union Award in 1971.

Preda&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Delirul&quot; (&quot;Delirium&quot;) is reflects an attempt to reconsider Ion Antonescu&#x27;s role in Romanian history, against the background of resurgent nationalist pride in socialist Romania. Here, Antonescu is painted as a tragic figure, who collaborated with Nazi Germany due to his belief that this was the only way to regain Bessarabia. The first edition of the novel quickly sold out.

He became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1974, and was promoted to titular post-mortem member in 1990.

The second edition of the novel &quot;Marele singuratic&quot; had appeared in 1976, and in 1977 he published &quot;Viața ca o pradă&quot; (&quot;Life as a Prey&quot;), a comprehensive autobiographical novel whose main theme is the crystallization of an artist&#x27;s conscience.

In 1980, Marin Preda published his last novel, &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; (&quot;The Most Beloved of Earthlings&quot;), regarded as a violent critique of communism. After a few short weeks on the market, the novel was withdrawn from all public, university, and school libraries, as well as all bookshops.

An eyewitness stated that in 1970, Preda had told President Nicolae Ceaușescu: &quot;If you want to introduce socialist realism, I, Marin Preda, will commit suicide.&quot;&quot; But the author had never publicly criticized socialist realism and never doubted the legitimacy of the communist regime.

== Personal life ==
In 1955, Preda married the poet Aurora Cornu. Their love letters were published posthumously. They divorced in 1959.

He then married Eta Vexler, who later immigrated to France in the early 1970s, ending their marriage.

Preda married a third time, to Elena Mitev. The couple had two sons, Nicolae and Alexandru.

Between 1975 and 1980 he lived in Bucharest at Strada Pictor Alexandru Romano no. 21; the home now displays a plaque dedicated to the author.

== Awards ==
In 1971, Preda was awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, 2rd class &quot;for special merits in the work of building socialism, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Romanian Communist Party establishment&quot;.

Preda&#x27;s novel &quot;Moromeții&quot; was awarded the State Prize for Literature in 1956.

== Death ==
On 16 May 1980, Preda died suddenly at the Writers&#x27; Mansion of Mogoșoaia Palace. The autopsy, which took place 24 hours after his death, showed that his blood alcohol concentration was 3.5 BAC, enough to fall into a coma. The official cause of death was asphixiation.

His family maintains that his sudden death was related to the publication of the novel &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; and occurred in suspicious circumstances. According to the forensic report, &quot;Marin Preda&#x27;s death was violent and was due to mechanical asphyxia by clogging the airways with a soft object, possibly a bed linen, in an alcoholic coma&quot;. Marin Preda was buried in the Writers&#x27; Alley in Bellu Cemetery.

<text>Tsunehisa Kimura (木村恒久, &quot;Kimura Tsunehisa&quot;; 1928–2008) was a Japanese artist influential in graphic design.

==Style==
Kimura&#x27;s photomontage imagine a surreal world of ongoing apocalypse and often showcase the encroachment of nature and natural phenomenon on man-made structures and the urban built environment.

His most famous ‘Visual Scandals’ series was published in book form by Parco, Tokyo in 1979.

==In popular culture==
Kimura provided the cover artwork to Midnight Oil&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;. Additionally, altered versions of his work Toshi Wa Sawayakana Asa Wo Mukaeru were used for the cover art of Climax Blues Band&#x27;s 1980 album Flying the Flag, Cut Copy&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Zonoscope&quot;, and Blu&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;York&quot;. Cut Copy would eventually go on to win the Artisan Award for Best Cover Art at the ARIA Music Awards of 2011.

Design commentators have drawn attention to similarities between Kimura&#x27;s work and the CGI envisioning of the Tom Cruise film Oblivion, particularly in the design of promotional material.

<doc id="1180875" wikidata="Q1257254" url="?curid=1180875" title="Mary (elephant)">
<text>Mary (c. 1894–September 13, 1916), also known as &quot;Murderous Mary&quot;, was a five-ton Asian elephant who performed in the &quot;Sparks World Famous Shows&quot; circus. After killing circus employee Walter “Red” Eldridge on his second day as her handler in September 1916, in Kingsport, Tennessee, she was hanged in nearby Erwin.

==Death of Red Eldridge==
On September 11, 1916, a homeless man named Red Eldridge, who landed a job as a transient hotel clerk, was hired as an elephant keeper by the &quot;Sparks World Famous Shows&quot; circus. He was killed by Mary in Sullivan County, Tennessee, on the following evening. Although unqualified, Eldridge led the elephant parade, riding atop Mary&#x27;s back; Mary was the star of the show, walking at the front. There have been several accounts of his death. One, recounted by W. H. Coleman, who claimed to be a witness, is that he prodded her behind the ear with a hook after she reached down to nibble on a watermelon rind. She went into a rage, snatched Eldridge with her trunk, threw him against a drink stand and stepped on his head, crushing it.

A contemporary newspaper account, from the &quot;Johnson City Staff&quot;, said that Mary &quot;collided its trunk vice-like about [Eldridge&#x27;s] body, lifted him in the air, then dashed him with fury to the ground... and with the full force of her beastly fury is said to have sunk her giant tusks entirely through his body. The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph, then with a sudden... swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd.&quot;

==Execution==
The details of the aftermath are confused in a maze of sensationalist newspaper stories and folklore. For example, the aforementioned newspaper account described Mary as impaling Eldridge with her tusks, despite female Asian elephants lacking tusks. Most accounts indicate that she calmed down afterwards and did not charge the onlookers, who began chanting &quot;Kill the elephant! Let&#x27;s kill it.&quot; Within minutes, local blacksmith Hench Cox tried to kill Mary, firing five rounds with little effect. Meanwhile, the leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included.
The circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the potentially ruinous situation was to kill the wounded elephant in public. On the following day, a foggy and rainy September 13, 1916, Mary was transported by rail to Unicoi County, Tennessee, where a crowd of over 2,500 people (including most of the town&#x27;s children) assembled in the Clinchfield Railroad yard.

The elephant was hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted industrial derrick between four o&#x27;clock and five o&#x27;clock that afternoon. The first attempt resulted in a snapped chain, causing Mary to fall and break her hip as dozens of children fled in terror. The severely wounded elephant died during a second attempt and was buried beside the tracks. A veterinarian examined Mary after the hanging and determined that she had a severely infected tooth in the precise spot where Red Eldridge had prodded her. The authenticity of a widely distributed (and heavily retouched) photo of her death was disputed by &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine.

==Aftermath==

In the century following the controversial death of Mary, Erwin was stigmatized as the &quot;town that hanged an elephant.&quot; In recent years, locals have been shedding the stigma by reviving the town&#x27;s image as a good place to live in and raising thousands of dollars to rescue elephants.

<text>An audit committee is a committee of an organisation&#x27;s board of directors which is responsible for oversight of the financial reporting process, selection of the independent auditor, and receipt of audit results both internal and external.

In a U.S. publicly traded company, an audit committee is an operating committee of the board of directors charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure. Committee members are drawn from members of the company&#x27;s board of directors, with a Chairperson selected from among the committee members. A qualifying (cf. paragraph &quot;Composition&quot; below) audit committee is required for a U.S. publicly traded company to be listed on a stock exchange. Audit committees are typically empowered to acquire the consulting resources and expertise deemed necessary to perform their responsibilities. The role of audit committees continues to evolve as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Many audit committees also have oversight of regulatory compliance and risk management activities.

Not for profit entities may also have an audit committee.

Internationally, an audit committee assists a board of directors to fulfil its corporate governance and overseeing responsibilities in relation to an entity&#x27;s financial reporting, internal control system, risk management system and internal and external audit functions. Its role is to provide advice and recommendations to the board within the scope of its terms of reference / charter. Terms of reference and requirements for an audit committee vary by country, but may be influenced by economic and political unions capable of passing legislation. The European Union directives are applied across Europe through legislation at the country level. Although specific legal requirements may vary by country in Europe, the source of legislation on corporate governance issues is often found at the European Union level and within the non-mandatory corporate governance codes that cross national boundaries.

==Definitions==
*Institute of Internal Auditors definition: &quot;The Audit committee refers to the governance body that is charged with oversight of the organization’s audit and control functions. Although these fiduciary duties are often delegated to an audit committee of the board of directors, the (...) Practice Advisory is also intended to apply to other oversight groups with equivalent authority and responsibility, such as trustees, legislative bodies, owners of an owner-managed entity, internal control committees, or full boards of directors&quot; (IIA Practice Advisory 2060-2 of 2004).
*In Nigeria, the Audit Committee is defined as a &quot;“Committee of Directors and the enterprises shareholders representatives whose specific responsibility is to review the annual financial statements before submission to the Board of Directors”&quot;.
*In Uzbekistan, audit committee — a committee, consisting of the members of the supervisory board of an economic entity, as a rule, including at least one independent member, responsible for establishing control over the correctness of financial reporting, selection of an independent auditing organization, overseeing audit processes, as well as obtaining and reviewing the results of internal and external audits ().
*The above definitions are focused on the private sector. A similar definition has been developed by the government auditors in the INTOSAI’s Internal Control Standards: &quot;&quot;A committee of the Board of Directors whose role typically focuses on aspects of financial reporting and on the entity&#x27;s processes to manage business and financial risk, and for compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee typically assists the Board with the oversight of (a) the integrity of the entity&#x27;s financial statements, (b) the entity&#x27;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (c) the independent auditors&#x27; qualifications and independence, (d) the performance of the entity&#x27;s internal audit function and that of the independent auditors and (e) compensation of company executives (in absence of a remuneration committee). (&quot;Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100, &quot;Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector”, annex 2).

In India, according to Section 177(1) of the Companies Act 2013, the Board of Directors of every listed company and such other class or classes of companies, as may be prescribed, shall constitute an Audit Committee.

As per Rule 6 (Committees of the Board) of the Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014, the Board of directors of every listed companies and the following classes of companies shall constitute an Audit Committee and a Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board:

All public companies having:
* Paid-up Capital ≥ ₹10 Crore;
* Turnover ≥ ₹100 Crore;
* Loans + Borrowings + Debentures + Deposits ≥ ₹50 Crore.

==Composition==
Usually, membership of the committee is subject to the maximum number of 6 persons. 
* In the US, a qualifying audit committee is required for listed publicly traded companies. To qualify, the committee must be composed of independent outside directors with at least one qualifying as a financial expert.
*The European Union&#x27;s 8th Directive on company law 2006/43/EC states that &quot;“Each public-interest entity shall have an audit committee. The Member State shall determine whether audit committees are to be composed of non-executive members of the administrative body and/or members of the supervisory body of the audited entity and/or members appointed by the general meeting of shareholders of the audited entity. At least one member of the audit committee shall be independent and shall have competence in accounting and/or auditing.”&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2006/43/EC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Institute of Internal Auditors best practice: &quot;“The audit committee will consist of at least three and no more than six members of the board of directors... Each committee member will be both independent and financially literate. At least one member shall be designated as the &quot;financial expert&quot; as defined by applicable legislation and regulation”&quot;.

==Responsibilities==
Boards of Directors and their committees rely on management to run the daily operations of the business. The Board&#x27;s role is better described as oversight or monitoring, rather than execution. Responsibilities of the audit committee typically include:
::* Overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process.
::* Monitoring choice of accounting policies and principles.
::* Overseeing hiring, performance and independence of the external auditors.
::* Oversight of regulatory compliance, ethics, and whistleblower hotlines.
::* Monitoring the internal control process.
::* Overseeing the performance of the internal audit function.
::* Discussing risk management policies and practices with management.

The duties of an audit committee are typically described in a committee charter, often available on the entity&#x27;s website.×

*European Union: Directive 2006/43/EC, article 41.2: (...) the audit committee shall, inter alia: (a) Monitor the financial reporting process; (b) Monitor the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s internal control, internal audit where applicable, and risk management systems; (c) Monitor the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts; (d) Review and monitor the independence of the statutory auditor or audit firm, and in particular the provision of additional services to the audited entity. 
*Public sector: Cf. Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100 

===Role in oversight of financial reporting and accounting===
Audit committees typically review financial statements quarterly and annually in public companies. In addition, members will often discuss complex accounting estimates and judgments made by management and the implementation of new accounting principles or regulations. Audit committees interact regularly with senior financial management such as the CFO and Controller and are in a position to comment on the capabilities of these managers. Should significant problems with accounting practices or personnel be identified or alleged, a special investigation may be directed by the audit committee, using outside consulting resources as deemed necessary.

External auditors are also required to report to the committee on a variety of matters, such as their views on management&#x27;s selection of accounting principles, accounting adjustments arising from their audits, any disagreement or difficulties encountered in working with management, and any identified fraud or illegal acts.

===Role in oversight of the external auditor===
Audit committees typically approve selection of the external auditor. The external auditor (also called a public accounting firm) reviews the entity&#x27;s financial statements quarterly, audits the entity&#x27;s financial statements annually, and issues an opinion providing assurance on the entity&#x27;s annual financial statements. Changing an external auditor typically also requires audit committee approval. Audit committees also help ensure the external auditor is independent, meaning no conflicts of interest exist that might interfere with the auditor&#x27;s ability to issue its opinion on the financial statements.
*European Union: Directive 2006/43/EC, article 41.3 and 41.4: &quot;In a public-interest entity, the proposal of the administrative or supervisory body for the appointment of a statutory auditor or audit firm shall be based on a recommendation made by the audit committee. The statutory auditor or audit firm shall report to the audit committee on key matters arising from the statutory audit, and in particular on material weaknesses in internal control in relation to the financial reporting process.&quot;

===Role in oversight of regulatory compliance===
Audit committees discuss litigation or regulatory compliance risks with management, generally via briefings or reports of the General Counsel, the top lawyer in the organisation. Larger corporations may also have a Chief Compliance Officer or Ethics Officer that report incidents or risks related to the entity&#x27;s code of conduct.

===Role in monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control process and of the internal audit===
Internal control includes the policies and practices used to control the operations, accounting, and regulatory compliance of the entity. Management and both the internal auditing function and external auditors provide reporting to the audit committee regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control.
*IIA Practice Advisory: Cf. PA1110-1 paragraphs 2 and 3 (where the “board” means “an organization&#x27;s governing body, such as a board of directors, supervisory board, (...) any other designated body of the organization, including the audit committee to whom the chief audit executive may functionally report)
* European best practice for the role of the Audit Committee in overseeing internal audit.

===Role in oversight of risk management===
Organizations have a variety of functions that perform activities to understand and address risks that threaten the achievement of the organization&#x27;s objectives. The policies and practices used by the entity to identify, prioritize, and respond to the risks (or opportunities) are typically discussed with the audit committee. Having such a discussion is required for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Many organizations are developing their practices towards a goal of a risk-based management approach called Enterprise risk management. Audit committee involvement in non-financial risk topics varies significantly by entity. Dr. Ram Charan has argued for risk management early warning systems at the corporate board level.
*European best practice for the role of the Audit Committee in risk management: cf.

==Impact of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002==
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 increased audit committees’ responsibilities and authority. It raised membership requirements and committee composition to include more independent directors. Companies were required to disclose whether or not a financial expert is on the committee. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the stock exchanges proposed new regulations and rules to strengthen audit committees.

==History==
Below are a few key milestones in the evolution of audit committees:
*1939: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) first endorsed the audit committee concept.
*1972: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first recommends that publicly held companies establish audit committees composed of outside (non-management) directors.
*1978: NYSE adopts a listing requirement that audit committees be composed entirely of independent directors.
*1988: AICPA issues SAS 61 &quot;Communication with Audit Committees&quot; addressing communications between the external auditor, audit committee and management of SEC reporting companies.
*1999: NYSE, NASD, AMEX, SEC and AICPA finalize major rule changes based on Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of the Corporate Audit Committee.
*2002: Sarbanes-Oxley Act is passed in the wake of corporate scandals and includes whistleblower and financial expert disclosure requirements for audit committees.

===Interaction with the board, and with non-executive board members===
*The European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA)’s best practice:
&quot;The work of the audit committee can only be valuable if sufficient time is allotted on the board agenda for the audit committee to present the results of its work. The audit committee should also feel that the board is taking appropriate action on its report.&quot;
*European Union best practice: Cf. European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (2008/2247(INI)): ‘’”(...) Stresses that recent experience shows the need for frequent and high-quality interaction within audit committees and between independent directors, supervisory boards and auditors; and that non-executive board members should consider carefully the possibility of having meetings without executive board members being present.”’’

===Frequency of interaction with management===
Many audit committee chairpersons conduct interim calls with key members of management between quarterly meetings. Key contacts may include the CEO, CFO, Chief Auditor, and external audit partner. Many boards also schedule dinners prior to formal meetings that allow informal interaction with management. Some companies also require their boards to spend a certain amount of time learning their operations beyond board meeting attendance.

===Executive sessions===
These are formally scheduled private meetings between the audit committee and key members of management or the external auditor. These meetings typically are unstructured and provide the opportunity for the committee to obtain the feedback of these managers in private. A key question audit committee members ask in such sessions is: &quot;Is there anything you would like to bring to our attention?&quot;

===Evaluation===
Audit committees should complete a self-evaluation annually to identify improvement opportunities. This involves comparing the committee&#x27;s performance versus its charter, any formal guidelines and rules, and against best practices. Such a review is confidential and may or may not include evaluations of particular members.

==Survey results==
Various consulting and public accounting firms perform research on audit committees, to provide benchmarking data. Some results are identified below:
*54% of committee members surveyed felt the audit committee was &quot;very effective&quot;, while 38% indicated &quot;somewhat effective.&quot;
*Risk management, internal control, and accounting estimates and judgments were the top priority areas for 2007.
*Most audit committees have 3-4 members and are usually chaired by persons with experience as a CFO, external auditor, or CEO.
*Audit committees meet 6-10 times per year, either face-to-face or via teleconference, with the former lasting from 1–4 hours and the latter 1–2 hours.
*Audit committee members devoted 50–150 hours to their responsibilities each year.
*The percentage of audit committees with oversight responsibility for: IT compliance (66%), business continuity (50%), and information security(45%).
*41% were &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the internal audit function, while 52% were &quot;somewhat satisfied.&quot;
*Two-thirds felt the Chief Internal Audit position was for a professional internal auditor, rather than as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to other roles.
*93% indicated the audit committee was &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;much more&quot; effective since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was implemented in 2002.
*58% of committee members were &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot; that they understood management&#x27;s processes to identify and assess significant business risks.
*Only 17% of audit committees had primary responsibility for oversight of non-financial risk; the full board had this responsibility in 56% of companies.

In a 2011 study, the Council of Europe concluded that: &quot;“The Benchmarking results from a sample of 15 international organisations in Europe show that 11 have an audit committee (of which the name may vary from Audit Committee, Advisory Committee on Audits, Audit Advisory Board, Audit Progress Committee, Finance and Audit Committee, Independent Advisory Oversight Committee, Independent Audit Advisory Committee of Experts) and in seven, the Audit committee plays a role in the selection of the External Auditor&quot;&quot;.

A 2009 study on 23 international organisations showed that 10 had an Audit Committee and 3 considered having one in future, with 8 reporting to the Governing Body level and 2 reporting to DG/Executive Director level. The sizes of all Audit Committees were between 3 and 9 members, with 5 committees having a mix of external expert members and internal members.

<text>Extasy Records is a Japanese record label founded in April 1986 by Yoshiki Hayashi, co-founder of the heavy metal band X Japan. The label&#x27;s first release was X&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;Orgasm&quot;.

Over the next few years, the label signed several then-little-known bands, among them future million-selling Glay and Luna Sea. Extasy along with Free-Will are credited with helping to spread the visual kei movement. The label also hosted a series of events to promote the groups, called Extasy Summits, which would also feature formerly signed bands that had already moved on to a major label.

==History==
Yoshiki Hayashi founded Extasy Records in Japan in 1986, using money he received from his mother when she sold her business. His band X Japan (then still named X) released their second single, &quot;Orgasm&quot;, as the label&#x27;s first release. In 1988, their debut album &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; came out and was a huge success for an independent band. Over the next couple of years Extasy signed many bands that would go on to have varying degrees of success and produced their early records, including , Tokyo Yankees and Ladies Room.

In February 1991, Yoshiki&#x27;s X Japan bandmate hide saw a band called Lunacy perform, and introduced him to them. Yoshiki signed them to Extasy, they changed their name to Luna Sea and took part in the label&#x27;s Nuclear Fusion Tour in March with Gilles de Rais and Sighs of Love Potion. On the tour, a 3-track sample CD including a song from each band was released. The following year Luna Sea&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released and they held a successful 45-date tour, enabling them to sign with major label MCA Victor in May 1992.

hide gave one of Glay&#x27;s demo tapes to Yoshiki, who then brought an entourage to watch their October 1993 show, where he offered the band a contract to Extasy Records. Their debut album, &quot;Hai to Diamond&quot;, was released on May 25, 1994.

To promote their bands, the label organized concerts called Extasy Summits, which besides current contracted bands, also included former acts who had left for major record labels. The first was held at Osaka Bourbon House in September 1988, with several more held, including one at Shibuya Public Hall in September 1989. Footage from two of the concerts was recorded and released on VHS (the second also on Laserdisc); recorded at the Nippon Budokan in October 1991 and recorded at Osaka-jō Hall in October 1992. The October 1992 Summit was actually X Japan&#x27;s first public performance with their new bassist Heath.

The compilation album &quot;Lighting &amp; Thunder&quot; was released in October 1998. On June 21, 2000, the compilation album &quot;History of Extasy 15th Anniversary&quot; was released. It includes 19 songs released by 14 different bands while on the label in celebration of its 15th anniversary. The album reached number 14 on the Oricon music chart.

In 2000, Yoshiki signed a deal with Warner Music Group to distribute the record labels Extasy Japan and Extasy Records International. Records on Extasy Japan were distributed in Japan by Warner Music Japan and records on Extasy Records International were distributed in America by Warner Bros. Records, marking the first time the two companies worked together in this way. The first release on Extasy Japan was the July 2000 single &quot;Pearl&quot; by singer Shiro, while the first release on Extasy Records International was by singer Aja in 2001.

In September 2007, Yoshiki announced that the soundtrack for the American movie &quot;Catacombs&quot; would be released on Extasy Records International. The soundtrack includes songs by Violet UK and Zilch.

Yoshiki has referred to the first day, October 14, 2016, of the three-day Visual Japan Summit at Makuhari Messe as &quot;Extasy Summit&quot; as it saw X Japan, Luna Sea and Glay perform.

In 2022, Yoshiki&#x27;s brother, Kouki Hayashi, became president and CEO of Extasy Records, establishing a distribution partnership with TuneCore.

==Extasy Recording Studios==
Extasy Recording Studios was a recording studio complex owned by Yoshiki Hayashi at 5253 Lankershim Blvd in North Hollywood, California, United States. Formerly known as One on One Recording, Yoshiki bought it from the previous owner, Jim David, in 1992 and renamed the studio after his record label in 1999. Discussing the purchase in 2010, Yoshiki explained that in Los Angeles people told him that One on One had the &quot;best drum-sounding room&quot; and so he attempted to book recording time there. However, Metallica had it booked for &quot;almost a year straight&quot; for their self-titled album with numerous bands scheduled after that, and he was told sarcastically that the only way to get in was to buy it, so he did.

Previously, well-known albums were recorded there, including &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; and &quot;Metallica&quot; (better known as &quot;The Black Album&quot;) by Metallica, &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; by Fiona Apple, &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; and &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; by Kiss, and &quot;Dirt&quot; by Alice in Chains.

Since Yoshiki purchased the facility in 1992, X Japan and Yoshiki&#x27;s related projects were the main recordings. Extasy Recording Studios was taken over by 17 Hertz, LLC in 2012 and is now known as 17 Hertz Studio.

Yoshiki also bought Brooklyn Recording Studios, which housed the Los Angeles offices of Maverick Records, in April 1998 from owners Madonna and Freddy DeMann. He renamed it One on One South, before using it as the headquarters of Extasy Records International.

<doc id="1180890" wikidata="Q3150306" url="?curid=1180890" title="Area code 914">
<text>Area code 914 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Westchester County, New York.

Area code 914 was one of the first area codes announced when the North American Numbering Plan was created in October 1947, when it was assigned to a numbering plan area (NPA) comprising Delaware, Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester counties, an area largely coextensive with the New York state portion of the New York metropolitan area, excluding New York City, which received area code 212. In 1951, Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties) received area code 516 in a split of 914.

This configuration remained for 49 years. By the end of the 1990s, the increasing demand for cell phones and Internet dial-up connections caused concerns for exhaustion of the numbering pool. In mitigation, numbering plan area 914 was reduced to Westchester County on June 5, 2000. The remainder was assigned the new area code 845. Area code 914 was retained by all cellphones in use in the plan area before the split.

Prior to October 2021, area code 914 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

<text>Captain Frederick Barter VC MC (17 January 1891 – 15 May 1953) was a British Army officer and a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was &quot;born at 60 Daniel Street, Cathays, Cardiff, one of three children born to Mr and Mrs Samuel Barter&quot;. His initial education was at Crwys Road Board School in Cardiff and, &quot;after working as a collier and later as a porter on the Great Western Railway&quot;, Barter joined the British Army as a private in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers (later the Royal Welch Fusiliers) in December 1908. After completing his terms of service he transferred to the army&#x27;s Special Reserve before &quot;working as a stove repairer for the Cardiff Gas Light &amp; Coke Company&quot; when the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914.

On 5 August, the day after the British declaration of war on Germany, Barter was mobilised for service with the 1st Battalion of the RWF. The battalion &quot;landed at Zeebrugge on 7 October&quot; and, &quot;by the 30th of the month&quot;, had been &quot;reduced to 86 men and one officer after heavy fighting at Zonnebeke and Zandvoorde&quot;.

He was 24 years old, and a company sergeant major in the Special Reserve, The Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army, attached to the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 May 1915 at Festubert, France, Company Sergeant-Major Barter, when in the first line of German trenches, called for volunteers to enable him to extend our line, and with the eight men who responded, he attacked the German position with bombs, capturing three German officers, 102 men and 500 yards of their trenches. He subsequently found and cut 11 of the enemy&#x27;s mine leads situated about 20 yards apart.

He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Special Reserve, The Royal Welch Fusiliers, 26 August 1915.

On 16 March 1917 he was seconded on probation with the Indian Army and was attached to the 4th battalion 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, with seniority as a Second Lieutenant of 26 May 1916. He was promoted Lieutenant 26 May 1917. He was awarded the Military Cross in the London Gazette 26 July 1918. The MC&#x27;s citation reads as follows:

He was admitted to the Indian Army on 6 May 1918, promoted captain on 26 May 1920 and retired from the Indian Army on 5 November 1922.

His VC is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum at Caernarfon Castle.

<text>The Golden Boy of Pye Corner is a small late-17th-century monument located on the corner of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane in Smithfield, central London. It marks the spot where the 1666 Great Fire of London was stopped, whereas the Monument indicates the place where it started. The statue of a naked boy is made of wood and is covered with gold; the figure was formerly winged. The late 19th-century building that incorporates it is a Grade II listed building but listed only for the figure.

It bears the following small inscription below it:

This Boy is in Memmory Put up for the late FIRE of LONDON Occasion&#x27;d by the Sin of Gluttony 1666.
The lower inscription, approximately below the boy, reads as follows:

The boy at Pye Corner was erected to commemorate the staying of the Great Fire, which, beginning at Pudding Lane, was ascribed to the sin of gluttony when not attributed to the papists as on the Monument, and the boy was made prodigiously fat to enforce the moral. He was originally built into the front of a public-house called &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; which used to occupy this site and was pulled down in 1910.

&quot;The Fortune of War&quot; was the chief house of call north of the river for resurrectionists in body snatching days. Years ago the landlord used to show the room where on benches round the walls the bodies were placed labelled with the snatchers&#x27; names, waiting till the surgeons at Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s could run round and appraise them.

<doc id="1180903" wikidata="Q7707684" url="?curid=1180903" title="Texas Fight">
<text>&quot;Texas Fight&quot; is the official fight song of the University of Texas at Austin and was written by Colonel Walter S. Hunnicutt in collaboration with James E. King, then director of the Marlin High School Band. The words, as finally adopted by the school, were written by Burnett “Blondie” Pharr, the director of the Longhorn Band from 1917-37.

It is sung to a fast tempo version Taps, a song played at many military funerals. &quot;Texas Fight&quot; is played following touchdowns and extra points at University of Texas (UT) football games, other Longhorn sports events, as well as on other occasions of celebration. The repeated strain contains portions of &quot;The Eyes of Texas,&quot; the school&#x27;s alma mater. It is also played at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport at the top of every hour.

==History and usage==
Hunnicutt wrote &quot;Texas Fight&quot; in response to the song used by their longtime rivals, Texas A&amp;M University. One of the Aggie songs then was Farmers Fight, which consisted of the words &quot;Farmers Fight&quot; sung to Taps, a song played at many military funerals. Impressed by the song, Hunnicutt figured he would write &quot;Texas Fight&quot; also sung to Taps, but making the song more march-like and having &quot;Texas&quot; throughout instead of &quot;Farmers.&quot; In a letter written in 1952 by Colonel Hunnicutt, he says &quot;I wrote &#x27;Texas Fight&#x27;... in an attempt to counteract the songs and yells of the Texas Aggies, which were not too complimentary to our Student Body and some of which tended to ridicule &#x27;The Eyes of Texas&#x27;.&quot;

The words of the song as finally adopted were written by Burnett &quot;Blondie&quot; Pharr, director of the Longhorn Band from 1917 to 1937. &quot;Texas Fight&quot; is played following touchdowns and extra points at University of Texas (UT) football games, other Longhorn sports events, as well as on other occasions of celebration.

The repeated strain contains portions of &quot;The Eyes of Texas,&quot; the school&#x27;s alma mater. This modification was made in the summer of 1967 at the suggestion of Charles &quot;Buster&quot; Griffith, a member of the trumpet section, and was premiered - unannounced - at the first football game that fall, after which it became tradition.

== Lyrics ==
The wording of the song is as follows.

===Alternate Lyrics===
&quot;Hail, Hail, the gang&#x27;s all here&quot; is rarely, if ever, sung. It is almost always replaced with &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, give &#x27;em hell! Go, Horns, go!&quot;
Another version often used at football games, particularly by students, is &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, give &#x27;em hell! Make &#x27;em eat shit!&quot;., which was intended originally as a jab at the Arkansas Razorbacks.

<text>Arend Heyting (; 9 May 1898 – 9 July 1980) was a Dutch mathematician and logician.

==Biography==
Heyting was a student of Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer at the University of Amsterdam, and did much to put intuitionistic logic on a footing where it could become part of mathematical logic. Heyting gave the first formal development of intuitionistic logic in order to codify Brouwer&#x27;s way of doing mathematics. The inclusion of Brouwer&#x27;s name in the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation is largely honorific, as Brouwer was opposed in principle to the formalisation of certain intuitionistic principles (and went as far as calling Heyting&#x27;s work a &quot;sterile exercise&quot;).

In 1942 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Heyting was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and died in Lugano, Switzerland.

<text>Cyril Joe Barton, VC (5 June 1921 – 31 March 1944) was a Second World War bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force who received the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth Armed Forces.

==Early life==
Cyril Barton was born in Elveden, in the county of Suffolk on 5 June 1921, the son of Ethel (1896–1958) and Frederick (1892–1963). He received his early schooling at Beverley Boys&#x27; School, in New Malden, in the county of Surrey. In his childhood he was a Boy Scout. At 16 years of age he was apprenticed as an engineer at the Parnall Aircraft Factory works in Tolworth, and was a part-time student of engineering at Kingston Technical College, in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey.

==Second World War==
Barton left his reserved occupation apprenticeship at the Parnall Aircraft Factory and volunteered for the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 16 April 1941, when he was 19 years of age.

After pilot training via the Arnold Scheme at Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama, and Darr Aero Tech at Albany, Georgia, in the United States, he qualified as a sergeant pilot on 10 November 1942. He then returned to England and completed his training with No. 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit at Rufforth, Yorkshire.

On 5 September 1943, he joined an aircrew assigned to Bomber Command&#x27;s No. 78 Squadron, with Barton receiving a commission as a pilot officer three weeks later. Their first operational mission was against a target at Montlucon in occupied France. Barton completed nine sorties with No. 78 Squadron until 15 January 1944, when he was posted to No. 578 Squadron, based at RAF Burn in North Yorkshire. His second sortie with the new squadron was an attack upon the city of Stuttgart in Germany, flying in Halifax LK797 (codename LK-E). By 30 March 1944, he had completed six sorties in LK797, which the crew had named &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Prior to his final mission from RAF Burn, Barton had already taken part in four attacks upon Berlin.

===Attack on Nuremberg===
On the night of 30 March 1944, while flying in an attack on the city of Nuremberg, in Germany, during the Battle of Berlin air offensive, whilst from the target, Pilot Officer Barton&#x27;s Handley Page Halifax bomber (Serial number: LK797) was badly shot-up in attacks by two &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; night-fighters, a Junkers Ju 88 and a Messerschmitt 210, resulting in two of its fuel tanks being punctured, both its radio and rear turret gun port being disabled, the starboard inner engine being critically damaged and the internal intercom lines being cut. In a running battle, despite the attacks being persistent and determined, Barton as captain of the aircraft succeeded by good flying in throwing off and escaping his faster and more agile assailants. However, a misunderstanding in on-board communications in the aircraft at the height of the crisis resulted in three of the 7-man crew bailing out, leaving Barton with no navigator, bombardier or wireless operator. Rather than turn back for England, he decided to press on with the mission, against the odds of further attacks in a semi-wrecked aircraft that was leaking fuel and handicapped by lack of a full crew. Arriving over the target, he released the bomb payload himself and then, as Barton turned the aircraft for home, its ailing starboard engine blew-up. Subsequently he nursed the damaged airframe over a four-and-a-half-hour flight with no navigational assistance back across the hostile defences of Germany and occupied Europe, and across the North Sea. As LK797 crossed the English coast at dawn 90 miles to the north of its base its fuel ran out because of the battle damage leakage and, with only one engine still running on vapours, and at too low a height to allow a remaining crew bail-out by parachute, Barton crash-landed the bomber at the village of Ryhope, steering away in the final descent from the houses and coal pit-head workings. Barton was pulled from the wrecked aircraft alive but died of injuries sustained in the landing before he reached the hospital. The three remaining on-board members of the crew survived the forced landing. One local man, a miner, also died when he was struck by a piece of the aeroplane&#x27;s wreckage during the impact of the crash.

After Barton&#x27;s death his mother received a posthumous letter addressed to her from him containing the following passage: &quot;I hope that you will never receive this letter, but I quite expect that you will. I know what &quot;Ops.&quot; over Germany means, and I have no illusions about it. By my own calculations the average lifespan of an aircrew is twenty ops (operations). and we have 30 to do in our first tour. I&#x27;m Writing this for two reasons. One to tell you how I would like my money to be spent that I have left behind me; two to tell you how I feel about meeting my Maker. 1. I intended as you know, taking a university course with my savings. Well, I would like it to be spent over the education of my brothers and sisters. 2. All I can say about this is that I am quite prepared to die It holds no terror for me. At times I&#x27;ve wondered whether I&#x27;ve been right in believing what I do, and just recently I&#x27;ve doubted the veracity of the Bible, but in the little time I&#x27;ve had to sort out intellectual problems I&#x27;ve been left with a bias in favour of the Bible. Apart from this, though, I have the inner conviction as I write, of a force outside myself, and my brain tells me that I have not trusted in vain. All I am anxious about is that you and the rest of the family will also come to know Him. Ken, I know already does. I commend my Saviour to you. I am writing to Doreen separately. I expect you will have guessed by now that we are quite in love with each other. Well, that&#x27;s covered everything now I guess, so love to Dad and all, Your loving son Cyril.&quot; The attack on Nuremberg was Barton&#x27;s nineteenth sortie.

In a last letter to his younger brother shortly before his death, Barton wrote: &quot;I am quite prepared to die, death hold no terrors for me. I have done nothing to merit glory.&quot;

===Awards===
For his actions in the attack on Nuremberg Barton was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in June 1944. Post-war he was posthumously issued the 1939–1945 Star; the Air Crew Europe Star; Defence Medal, and the War Medal 1939–1945.

==Memorials==

Barton&#x27;s body was buried with full military honours in April 1944 in a registered war grave at the South-West corner of Kingston-upon-Thames Cemetery, in the County of Surrey.

Barton Green in New Malden, Surrey, where he had attended school, was named in his honour in the early 1950s.

Barton Road at the Yorkshire Air Museum in Elvington, North Yorkshire, was named in his honour in the year 2000 on the 56th anniversary of his death in action.

A housing estate in Ryhope, &quot;Barton Park&quot;, was also named after him, and a nearby street was named &quot;Halifax Place&quot;, after the bomber-type that he flew in the exploit.

Coombe Boys&#x27; School (formerly named Beverley Boys&#x27; School when Barton was a pupil there) in New Malden, Surrey, named a new building after him in 2009.

Kingston College, where Barton was a student when the war broke out, offers an annual prize for the pupil of the year, which is named after him.

A portrait painting of him hangs in his memory in the &quot;Wheatsheaf Inn&quot; at Burn, North Yorkshire, where Barton&#x27;s squadron, 578 Squadron, was based at the time of his last sortie.

His Victoria Cross is on display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford.

Longhedge housing estate in Salisbury, Wiltshire named the street Barton Place in his honour in 2022.

<doc id="1180914" wikidata="Q7936694" url="?curid=1180914" title="Vita Nova">
<text>Vita Nova (meaning New Life in Latin) was a Swiss publishing house at 36 Fluhmattstrasse in Lucerne, Switzerland, that was established in January 1934 and co-founded by Rudolf Roessler along with the Catholic bookseller Josef Stocker and the financier Henriette Racine. It was run by the journalist and theater critic Rudolf Roessler. 

== Beginnings ==
Stocker had been encouraged to help co-found the publishing firm by the Jesuit theologian Otto Karrer. 

== Books published ==
Vita Nova was an anti-Nazi publishing house that primarily published German writers living in exile. It published some fifty brochures and books critical of both Nazism and Stalinism; writers often based their arguments on Christian values. In 1935, the publishing house published &quot;Die Gefährdung des Christentums durch Rassenwahn und Judenverfolgung&quot; (The Endangerment of Christianity through Racial Theories and the Persecution of the Jews), in which recognized Catholic and Protestant leaders comment on the connections between National Socialist racial doctrine and anti-Semitism. Among the personalities who contributed essays were the Anglican cleric William Ralph Inge (London), the Czech philosopher Emanuel Rádl (Prague), Johann Alois Scheiwiler (Bishop of St. Gallen), and the Norwegian novelist Sigrid Undset. Nicolas Berdyaev published a German translation of &quot;The Worth of Christianity and the Unworthiness of Christians&quot; with Vita Nova in 1936. The small firm also published books that were critical of Francoist Spain.

==Memorandum==

From 1940 to 1941, Roessler wrote a 94-page memorandum under the pseudonym R. A. Hermes that Vita Nova published, &quot;Die Kriegsschauplätze und die Bedingungen der Kriegführung&quot; (Memorandum on the war situation after the Battle of Britain). Although the German Reich had not yet invaded the Soviet Union, Roessler predicted that it would have a difficult time in the further course of the war. Great Britain and the United States of America, which was not yet at war, controlled the major passages on the world&#x27;s oceans and the Axis powers Germany and Italy would first have to acquire this position before the war could be won on their side. Territorial gains could contribute to the success of the war, but also to its failure.

The decisive factor was whether the acquirer had to dominate the territory by force and the associated effort, or whether he could retain enough partisans in the occupied country. The German Reich lacked this throughout, especially in relation to Poland and the Soviet Union. From the outset, these campaigns were designed to be a war of annihilation between two races and two world views. Winning over partisans was neither possible nor intended.

<text>Garrett Birkhoff (January 19, 1911 – November 22, 1996) was an American mathematician. He is best known for his work in lattice theory.

The mathematician George Birkhoff (1884–1944) was his father.

== Life ==
The son of the mathematician George David Birkhoff, Garrett was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He began the Harvard University BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to Cambridge University to study mathematical physics but switched to studying abstract algebra under Philip Hall. While visiting the University of Munich, he met Constantin Carathéodory who pointed him towards two important texts, Van der Waerden on abstract algebra and Speiser on group theory.

Birkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not obtain an M.A. Nevertheless, after being a member of Harvard&#x27;s Society of Fellows, 1933–36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard.

During the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues Marshall Stone and Saunders Mac Lane, substantially advanced American teaching and research in abstract algebra. In 1941 he and Mac Lane published &quot;A Survey of Modern Algebra&quot;, the second undergraduate textbook in English on the subject (Cyrus Colton MacDuffee&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Abstract Algebra&quot; was published in 1940). Mac Lane and Birkhoff&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; (1967) is a more advanced text on abstract algebra. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, &quot;Lattice Theory&quot; (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned lattice theory into a major branch of abstract algebra. His 1935 paper, &quot;On the Structure of Abstract Algebras&quot; founded a new branch of mathematics, universal algebra. Birkhoff&#x27;s approach to this development of universal algebra and lattice theory acknowledged prior ideas of Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schröder, and Alfred North Whitehead; in fact, Whitehead had written an 1898 monograph entitled &quot;Universal Algebra&quot;.

During and after World War II, Birkhoff&#x27;s interests gravitated towards what he called &quot;engineering&quot; mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics, including the bazooka. In the development of weapons, mathematical questions arose, some of which had not yet been addressed by the literature on fluid dynamics. Birkhoff&#x27;s research was presented in his texts on fluid dynamics, &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; (1950) and &quot;Jets, Wakes and Cavities&quot; (1957).

Birkhoff, a friend of John von Neumann, took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. Birkhoff supervised the Ph.D. thesis of David M. Young on the numerical solution of the partial differential equation of Poisson, in which Young proposed the successive over-relaxation (SOR) method. Birkhoff then worked with Richard S. Varga, a former student, who was employed at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory of the Westinghouse Electronic Corporation in Pittsburgh and was helping to design nuclear reactors. Extending the results of Young, the Birkhoff–Varga collaboration led to many publications on positive operators and iterative methods for &quot;p&quot;-cyclic matrices.

Birkhoff&#x27;s research and consulting work (notably for General Motors) developed computational methods besides numerical linear algebra, notably the representation of smooth curves via cubic splines.

Birkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.D.s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1948–1949 and the president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics for 1966–1968. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1974.

<text>Raymond Kennedy (28 July 1951 – 30 November 2021) was an English footballer who won every domestic honour in the game with Arsenal and Liverpool in the 1970s and early 1980s. Kennedy played as a forward for Arsenal and then played as a left-sided midfielder for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the English Football League. Also, he won 17 caps for England between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.

Kennedy turned professional for Arsenal in November 1968. He made his first-team debut 10 months later and went on to win the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division and FA Cup Double in 1970–71, and then play on the losing side in the 1972 FA Cup final. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record £200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that Bill Shankly resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager Bob Paisley converted him to a left-sided midfielder, he went on to help Liverpool become the dominant club in English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1981–82), the FA Charity Shield four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the European Cup three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the UEFA Cup (1976), UEFA Super Cup (1977), and League Cup (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1978), and World Club Championship (1981) and won the &quot;Match of the Day&quot;&#x27;s Goal of the Season award in 1978–79.

He was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all-round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the England under-23 side, he could not translate his club form into a good international career. He was used as a stand-in for Trevor Brooking before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at Euro 1980. Bob Paisley described him as &quot;one of Liverpool&#x27;s greatest players and probably the most underrated&quot;.

Kennedy joined Swansea City for a £160,000 fee in January 1982 and added a Welsh Cup winners medal to his collection four months later. However, the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the Fourth Division with Hartlepool United in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season, he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in November 1984. His life after football was difficult, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.

==Club career==
Ray Kennedy was born on 28 July 1951 in Seaton Delaval, a former pit village in Northumberland, to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and housewife, respectively. He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet. He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a scout at Port Vale and began training at Vale Park after manager Stanley Matthews came to the Kennedy home to persuade him to sign schoolboy forms at the club. However, at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was &quot;too slow to be a footballer&quot;. Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson said he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster. The club released him after being told that he would never make it as a professional.

Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts. The pair scored 142 goals between them and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.

===Arsenal===

Kennedy was spotted by Arsenal playing for New Hartley Juniors. Though the scouts had initially gone to the game to watch his striker partner, Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968. He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968. He had a difficult task though to win a first-team place, as manager Bertie Mee used only 15 players throughout the entire 1968–69 season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the Reserve team as they claimed the Football Combination Division One title.

He made his first-team debut on 29 September 1969, against Glentoran in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and his First Division debut as a substitute on 18 October, a 1–1 draw with Sunderland at Roker Park. He scored his first goal for the Gunners in the reverse fixture against Sunderland at Highbury, which ended in a 3–1 win. He went on to appear as a 77th-minute substitute in the first leg of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Belgian club Anderlecht at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, and scored a late goal in a 3–1 defeat. Though he did not appear in the second leg, his goal proved to be decisive as Arsenal claimed a 4–3 aggregate victory to win the first European trophy in the club&#x27;s history.

Charlie George broke his ankle on the opening game of the 1970–71 season, and Kennedy replaced him as John Radford&#x27;s strike partner for the following game and went on to feature in the remaining league fixtures of the campaign as Arsenal went on to be crowned champions. They exited the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup with a defeat to the German side 1. FC Köln at the quarter-final stage, though after their draw with Lazio in the First Round Kennedy was attacked by some of the Lazio players in an Italian restaurant, and in the ensuing brawl, police pulled a gun on teammate Eddie Kelly; Kennedy later said the Lazio players targeted him due to his &quot;cheeky face&quot;. Back in the league, he scored his first hat-trick in victory over Nottingham Forest. However, he admitted after the match that he was &quot;still expecting to be dropped any minute&quot;. Arsenal overtook Leeds United to win the league title on the final day of the season, Kennedy scoring the only goal of the game with a late header in a 1–0 victory over North London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. In the FA Cup, Arsenal progressed past Yeovil Town, Portsmouth (following a replay), Manchester City, Leicester City (following a replay), and Stoke City (following a replay), before meeting Liverpool in the final at Wembley Stadium. Liverpool led early in extra time, but goals from George Graham and Charlie George won the game for Arsenal. They secured only the fourth Double in English football. Kennedy had missed some good chances throughout the match, though he later pointed out that &quot;nobody really remembers anything bad if you win&quot;.

Arsenal endured a poor start to the 1971–72 season, and as a result, Mee purchased Alan Ball from Everton for £220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would have proved to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first-team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes. He scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for the second successive season.

He struggled at the start of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over . Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity. Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where Sunderland beat them.

Arsenal dropped into mid-table throughout the 1973–74 season, with McLintock&#x27;s departure signalling the demise of the Double-winning team. Kennedy failed to score from 6 October to mid-January, and speculation rose of possible moves to Sunderland, Newcastle United, or Aston Villa. In February, he released a statement saying that &quot;my game has gone downhill since I got married but has started to pick up again now I am in bachelordom... I feel that I am better off without her&quot;. He ended the season in good form, though Mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with Brian Kidd.

===Liverpool===
In July 1974, Kennedy was sold to Liverpool for a club record £200,000. Manager Bill Shankly resigned on the same day as the transfer was made, though had admired Kennedy for years and stated that &quot;maybe it will be said that one of the last things I did at this club was to sign a great new player&quot;. Shortly after the move Kennedy got back in touch with his estranged wife. The pair began living together in Ainsdale. New manager Bob Paisley handed Kennedy his debut in place of John Toshack against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 31 August 1974. It took Kennedy 22 minutes to open his goalscoring account as the Reds recorded a comfortable 3–0 win. Liverpool ended the 1974–75 season as runners-up to Derby County in the league. Kennedy featured just 25 times in the league as Toshack formed an effective combination with Kevin Keegan up front and started to become frustrated and disillusioned in the club.

Bob Paisley felt Kennedy could perform as a midfielder. After Kennedy replaced an injured Peter Cormack against Middlesbrough on 1 November, he went on to make the number five shirt his own for the rest of the decade. His new position allowed him to use his vision and distribution to create chances for his teammates whilst still allowing him to make runs into scoring positions to add goals himself. Liverpool won the league title in 1975–76 with a final day victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers to beat Queens Park Rangers into second place. They also secured the UEFA Cup, knocking out Hibernian (Scotland), Real Sociedad (Spain), Śląsk Wrocław (Poland), Dynamo Dresden (Germany), and Barcelona (Spain), before facing Belgian side Club Brugge in the final. Liverpool were losing 2–0 in the first leg of the final at Anfield before Kennedy scored the first of Liverpool&#x27;s three goals to overturn the deficit; in the return leg at the Olympiastadion, Liverpool drew 1–1 to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate.

Liverpool opened the new season by claiming the 1976 FA Charity Shield with a 1–0 win over Southampton and went on to win the league largely on their home form, Kennedy&#x27;s goal in a 2–1 win over title contenders Ipswich Town on 30 April proving to be decisive. Though Liverpool failed to win any of their last four league matches, they finished one point clear of Manchester City in second. Liverpool won the European Super Cup with a comprehensive 7–1 victory over German club Hamburg. Liverpool also reached the 1977 FA Cup final but lost the chance to follow Arsenal&#x27;s feat at achieving the Double as they were beaten 2–1 by bitter rivals Manchester United. In the European Cup, Liverpool beat Crusaders (Northern Ireland), Trabzonspor (Turkey), AS Saint-Étienne (France), and FC Zürich (Switzerland) to reach the final against German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the final at Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico, Keegan was fouled by Vogts and won a late penalty which Phil Neal converted to give Liverpool a 3–1 victory.

Following a 0–0 draw with Manchester United in the 1977 FA Charity Shield, a disappointing start to the 1977–78 season saw Liverpool out of the title race early on whilst they exited the FA Cup at the Third Round. They did, though, recover to post a second-place finish in the league after winning nine of their last 12 matches to end the campaign seven points behind Nottingham Forest. They progressed to the League Cup final after Kennedy scored the winning goal past former club Arsenal in the semi-final. However, Liverpool lost out 1–0 to Nottingham Forest in the replay of the final at Old Trafford. Despite these domestic disappointments, Liverpool went on to reach the final of the European Cup after defeating Dynamo Dresden, Benfica (Portugal), and Borussia Mönchengladbach; Mönchengladbach manager Udo Lattek singled out Kennedy as the best player of the semi-final, as Kennedy scored a goal and provided assists for both Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Case in the second leg. In the final, Liverpool faced Club Brugge at Wembley and successfully defended the trophy after seeing out a 1–0 win.

Liverpool&#x27;s chances of winning a third successive European Cup were ended with a defeat to Nottingham Forest in the First Round. However, they opened the league campaign with six straight wins and dominated the league by finishing eight points clear of second-placed Forest, scoring 85 goals and conceding just 16 in the process. His goal against Derby County on 24 February won him &quot;Match of the Day&quot;&#x27;s Goal of the Season award. Writing in his autobiography, Paisley named the 1978–79 team as the best championship team he had been associated with during his 40 years with the club. Manchester United again denied them the chance to win the Double, however, as United knocked Liverpool out of the semi-finals of the FA Cup following a replay at Goodison Park. Liverpool also lost the 1978 European Super Cup, following a 4–3 aggregate defeat to Anderlecht.

Liverpool won the 1979 FA Charity Shield with a 3–1 victory over Kennedy&#x27;s former club Arsenal, but a knee ligament injury caused Kennedy to miss a small number of games early in the season. Kennedy also felt that left-back Alan Kennedy was not up to the required standard, saying, &quot;he took five years off my career... Alan had no nerves and not much brain... we didn&#x27;t gel on the pitch&quot;. Alan blamed nerves for his difficulty in finding Kennedy with accurate passes. Kennedy also began to face problems off the pitch, resulting in both he and Jimmy Case being arrested after they attacked a hotelier who had confused Kennedy with his namesake Alan. The pair pleaded guilty to affray and were fined £150 each; despite this and other similar incidents, Kennedy did manage to avoid his off-field antics affecting his form or discipline on the pitch. Kennedy later said &quot;it was a good friendship&quot; but &quot;we were bad for each other&quot;. Liverpool finished two points clear of second-place Manchester United in the league, with Kennedy claiming nine goals in 56 appearances. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Arsenal in a replay following three draws in two replays and the original tie. In the summer, Kennedy signed a new four-year contract with the club.

Liverpool retained the Charity Shield by beating West Ham United 1–0; however, despite only losing eight league games all season they won 17 and drew 17 of their remaining fixtures and ended the 1980–81 season in fifth place, nine points behind champions Aston Villa. In the League Cup, they knocked out Bradford City, Swindon Town, Portsmouth, Birmingham City, and Manchester City to reach the final against West Ham United. They then beat West Ham 2–1 in a replay of the final to claim the first League Cup in the club&#x27;s history. They also reached the European Cup final after getting past Oulun Palloseura (Finland), Aberdeen (Scotland), CSKA Sofia (Bulgaria), and Bayern Munich (Germany). In the semi-final against Bayern, Kennedy was named as captain as both Graeme Souness and Phil Thompson were injured and went on to score what proved to be the winning away goal at the Olympiastadion, cementing his reputation as a semi-final specialist. Liverpool then beat Spanish club Real Madrid 1–0 in a dour final to win a third European Cup.

Following the sale of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool and was sent off twice in the space of a few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league appearance for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo&#x27;s National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy&#x27;s 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982 but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree on personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.

===Later career===
In January 1982, Kennedy was signed by Swansea City on a four-year contract for a £160,000 fee to play under former teammate John Toshack. The Swans had an unsuccessful attempt to win the league title, and five defeats in their final six games saw them end up in sixth place, 17 points behind champions Liverpool. They did though win the Welsh Cup after beating South Wales derby rivals Cardiff City 2–1 in the final at Vetch Field. Despite voicing his concerns over the team and his own future at the club to Toshack, Kennedy was appointed club captain for the 1982–83 season. He became injured with niggling hamstring problems in mid-season, and after one increasingly rare performance the local press described him as seemingly &quot;unwilling to work and his usual composure on the ball was lacking&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s declining physical abilities were due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, he would not be diagnosed with the condition until after his retirement. Toshack stripped Kennedy of the captaincy and suspended him from Vetch Field for two weeks. He was placed on the transfer list in March 1983, and Swansea went on to be relegated into the Second Division. The club&#x27;s financial problems worsened, and players were asked to take a cut in wages to help ease the crisis, but Kennedy refused. Toshack was sacked in October 1983, and Kennedy agreed to have his contract terminated.

Kennedy signed with Mick Docherty&#x27;s Hartlepool United of the Fourth Division in November 1983. Docherty was sacked the following month, and unsuccessfully attempted to report the club for negotiating an illegal contract with Kennedy. His assistant, Billy Horner, stepped up to manage the club for a second time in the face of a mounting financial crisis. Hartlepool were forced to apply for re-election at the end of the season, and Kennedy was promoted to player-coach for his help in boosting support for the club&#x27;s re-election campaign. However, he left Victoria Park in summer 1984 to take up the position as player-manager of Cypriot side Pezoporikos. He became increasingly unable to play the game though due to his body&#x27;s physical decline, and after a poor start to the 1984–85 season he returned to England in December against the board&#x27;s wishes and handed in his resignation the following month, to allow him to run the Melton Constable public house in Seaton Sluice, Whitley Bay. In January 1985, he joined Northern League side Ashington, managed by former teammate Colin Todd, but could only manage six appearances after suffering from increasingly alarming stiffness in his right leg due to his worsening Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Unable to turn out for his own Melton Constable Sunday League team, he soon found daily life difficult to cope with.

==International career==
Kennedy won six England under-23 caps, following his first appearance in a win over Wales at the County Ground on 5 January 1972.

Don Revie gave Kennedy his first cap on 24 March 1976 in a friendly with Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham; Kennedy scored the opening goal as England won the game 2–1. However, he was never able to establish himself as England&#x27;s left-sided midfielder of choice due to the form of Trevor Brooking. He played in British Home Championship games against Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, before he was dropped for the next seven games. He travelled with the squad for the 1977 tour of South America, and also that year claimed two more international goals in qualifying games against Luxembourg. He then dropped out of the England picture under new manager Ron Greenwood. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy, playing against Belgium and Italy before he was dropped for England&#x27;s final group game against Spain. He retired from international football on 17 caps in March 1981, citing dissatisfaction with the England hierarchy. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley wrote in his autobiography that &quot;for England he [Kennedy] was played quite wrongly in a defensive role, being asked to pick people up. Ray closes people down by positional skill and does not need to chase around the pitch&quot;. Kennedy stated that &quot;I feel more pride in the red jersey of Liverpool than the white shirt of England&quot; and that &quot;I am resigning here and now as Greenwood&#x27;s bridesmaid&quot;.

==Style of play==
Kennedy was a strong player with average speed, good technical ability, and an excellent first touch. Arsenal coach Don Howe compared Kennedy to Tommy Lawton, and stated that Kennedy had &quot;all the hallmarks of a classical centre forward, size, strength, bravery and skill, heading ability and a powerful left-foot shot&quot;. He had a good temperament and could not be provoked by harsh opposition challenges. A psychological examination conducted on behalf of Arsenal revealed that Kennedy rated highly for his ability to respond to coaching; was rated above average for aggressiveness, determination, guilt-proneness (accepting responsibility for the team); was scored average for drive/ambition, self-confidence, emotional control, and mental toughness; and scored below average for leadership, conscientiousness, and trust.

Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson said that Kennedy &quot;had an alarming lack of self esteem... but there was an underlying fearsome strength, an assassin&#x27;s eye and a hard-man interior&quot;. After Liverpool manager Bob Paisley moved Kennedy into midfield, he said that &quot;Ray Kennedy was born to play. A natural, great ability and an obvious Liverpool player who could be moulded. I knew he could play anywhere.&quot; He showed minor signs of Parkinson&#x27;s disease as early as 1970, such as fatigue after games and slowed movement in his right arm, though it was not until 1982 that it began to have a noticeable effect on his game.

==Later life==
Kennedy was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease by a specialist on 4 November 1984. He permitted his image to be used to promote a public campaign to increase awareness of the disease. His involvement in the Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Society led to him meeting his childhood hero Muhammad Ali. He was also invited to do some coaching at Sunderland in the 1986–87 season by manager Lawrie McMenemy, and worked as a part-time coach from February to April 1987. At this point, he was promoted to first-team coach.

His wife, Jennifer, left him in October 1987 after he punched her in the face and kicked her down the stairs of the family home; this ended a difficult 15-year marriage blighted by frequent infidelity on his part. They had two children: Cara (born July 1976) and Dale (born January 1981). Former Liverpool teammate Ray Clemence recalled how Kennedy &quot;worked hard and played hard&quot;. Other teammates Steve Heighway and Phil Thompson noted that Kennedy was a &quot;quiet man&quot;, though &quot;women were always chasing after him&quot; and &quot;off the pitch he needed to be handled quite gently, and everything had to be organised just right otherwise there would be trouble&quot;. Completing a bad end to 1987, his licence at the Melton Constable was revoked. His prescribed L-DOPA medication also became less effective and he became increasingly isolated. His condition improved when he began injections of apomorphine. He was reliant on the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association to pay his medical expenses, and his divorce as well as business and tax problems wiped out his savings. A testimonial match was held between Arsenal and Liverpool in April 1991. A charity appeal was also set up to help pay his living costs. In late 1992 he began suffering from extreme paranoia, mostly due to the side effects of his medication, but regained his mental faculties following a short stay in hospital.

He published his autobiography &quot;Ray of Hope&quot; in 1993, co-authored by Dr. Andrew Lees, who at that time treated Kennedy for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Later that year he sold his collection of medals and international caps to raise funds. In 2002, he was reported as living alone in a bungalow in New Hartley. In an interview two years later, he said that he suffered from loneliness and hallucinations due to his condition and the side effects of his medication. Following the interview a Liverpool fan bought Kennedy a computer, which allowed him to make friends on football chat rooms. Kennedy remained a favourite amongst Liverpool supporters decades after leaving the club, and was voted in at No. 25 on the 2013 poll &#x27;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&#x27;. He died on 30 November 2021, at the age of 70.

<text>The Chrystie Street Connection is a set of New York City Subway tunnels running the length of Chrystie Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It is one of the few track connections between lines of the former Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) and Independent Subway System (IND) divisions, which together constitute the system&#x27;s B Division. A major branch of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, it connects the Sixth Avenue Line to the BMT Brighton Line and BMT Fourth Avenue Line via the north side of the Manhattan Bridge and to the BMT Jamaica Line over the Williamsburg Bridge. The project, opened in 1967 and 1968, also includes the Sixth Avenue Line&#x27;s Grand Street and 57th Street stations, the latter of which is not part of the connection itself.

The connection was originally conceived as part of the long delayed Second Avenue Subway, and, along with the three stations added with the opening of phase 1, is one of the few completed sections of the project.

== Route description ==
===Manhattan Bridge connection===

The two tracks that run the full length of the connection begin as a continuation of the IND Sixth Avenue Line express tracks east of Broadway–Lafayette Street. These tracks include the line&#x27;s only station, Grand Street, and connections to the two northern tracks over the Manhattan Bridge. The IND Sixth Avenue Line express tracks formerly continued east, ending slightly east of the Second Avenue station, and were planned to extend into Brooklyn and beyond as part of a never-built major system expansion called the IND Second System. Those tracks still exist at Second Avenue station, but now connect to the local tracks west of the station.

The two tracks on the north side of the Manhattan Bridge formerly carried trains to the BMT Broadway Line, which now connects to the tracks on the south side of the bridge. The south side tracks had been connected to the BMT Nassau Street Line, carrying the Nassau Street Loop service via Chambers Street from 1915. The northern tracks of the bridge saw heavier traffic loads because it led to Midtown Manhattan, compared to the southern tracks, which made three stops in Lower Manhattan before returning to Brooklyn. As a result of the uneven traffic distribution, the Manhattan Bridge started tilting to its north side. The connection to the Nassau Street Line was cut north of Chambers Street at the Manhattan Bridge end and is used for storage from the Nassau Street end.

The opening of the Chrystie Street Connection to the Manhattan Bridge allowed the integration of four major routes of the combined system. The service of the IND was through-routed with the BMT West End Line service as the , and the service of the IND was through-routed with the BMT Brighton Line service as the D. In 2004, the Brooklyn routes and terminals of the B and D trains were swapped as part of the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction from 1986 to 2004.

===Williamsburg Bridge connection===

The two tracks that connect to the Williamsburg Bridge split from the Sixth Avenue Line local tracks east of Broadway – Lafayette Street and feed into the BMT Nassau Street Line west of Essex Street. The purpose of this portion of the connector was to allow trains originating in northern and eastern Brooklyn and southern and eastern Queens to operate into Midtown Manhattan via the Sixth Avenue Line, rather than having to turn south along Nassau Street. The KK (later renamed the K) service, which used these tracks, proved unpopular; as such, it only operated from July 1, 1968, to August 29, 1976, when it was cut as part of an ongoing retrenchment of service during New York City&#x27;s fiscal crisis.

The connection was used for a time to move equipment to and from the BMT Eastern Division, but was not used in regular service again until budget cuts forced a reroute of the along the connection starting on June 27, 2010. The M had been rerouted to replace the discontinued route on the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills–71st Avenue.

==Development==

=== Planning ===
A plan similar to the Chrystie Street Connection was proposed as part of the Second Avenue Subway (SAS) under the Board of Transportation&#x27;s 1944–1948 Capital Program, with connections from the 2nd Avenue line to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges, as well as a new station at Grand and Chrystie Streets. This plan would have allowed service from Grand Street to run south to Chambers and Broad Streets on the BMT Nassau Street Line, providing an additional East River crossing via the Montague Street Tunnel.

The New York City Board of Estimate voted in September 1951 to construct the Second Avenue Subway and several related lines for $500 million. The next year, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) indicated that it would award contracts for the construction of an section of tunnel between Hester and Delancey Streets, including a station at Grand Street, as part of the SAS project. Work had been expected to begin in mid-1952 but was delayed because of engineering difficulties.

By 1954, the BOT&#x27;s successor, the New York City Transit Authority, had asked the city for $37.3 million to begin constructing the Chrystie Street Connection. In 1955, the TA recommended that the Board of Estimate approve a contract to reconstruct a junction near the DeKalb Avenue station, on the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan Bridge, to eliminate a bottleneck there. This was the first step in a larger plan to improve transit service between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Chrystie Street Connection would utilize the additional capacity created by reconstructing the tracks around DeKalb Avenue.

=== Construction ===
In mid-1957, the New York City government solicited bids from contractors to construct the various parts of the connection. That October, the Board of Estimate approved an initial $10.2 million for the connection. This initial funding would be used to construct the connection to the Williamsburg Bridge, as well as the section of the Manhattan Bridge connection from Delancey to Stanton Street. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 25, 1957, with Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and TA officials in attendance. The project was constructed in conjunction with the addition of express tracks on the Sixth Avenue Line between 34th Street and West 4th Street, adding capacity to the line. It was expected that the project would be finished in three years. Workers were constructing the segment of the Manhattan Street connection beneath the existing Nassau Street Line by 1959. Concrete workers went on strike while the connection was under construction, raising concerns that the BMT tunnel could be undermined; to prevent the tunnel from collapsing, the concrete workers&#x27; union made an exception allowing workers to pour concrete for the tunnel.

In 1962, the construction of an extension of the Sixth Avenue Line to a new terminal at 57th Street was announced. This would be the final major component of the plan to increase Brooklyn to Manhattan capacity. In February 1963, construction of the tunnel for the Chrystie Street Connection was 95 percent complete. It was expected that contracts for track work would be put out for bidding in about a month, after which contracts would be let for ventilation, drainage, lighting, and signals. In addition, the contract for the construction of an extension of the Sixth Avenue Line from 52nd Street to 58th Street for the new 57th Street terminal was expected to be put out for bidding in May. In August 1963, the project was expected to be completed in 1966. On January 23, 1964, the entire seven-block length of Chrystie Street was fully reopened to traffic. It had been subjected to different closures for six years for the construction of the line. Later that year, the tracks in the new connection were laid. In contrast to subway tracks on existing lines, which contained wooden cross ties, the new tracks were installed on rubber pads attached to the concrete track bed, thereby dampening noise from trains.

In 1965, the connection was projected to cost $100 million (), and provide capacity for 52,000 additional riders per hour between Brooklyn and Manhattan. This included 14,000 additional riders on the BMT West End Line, 9,000 on the BMT Sea Beach Line, 17,000 on the BMT Brighton Line, and 12,000 on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. By January of that year, lighting, power, and signal equipment had been installed on the connection. In June 1965, completion of the section including the Grand Street station was expected in 1966, with the entire project&#x27;s completion planned for 1967. To allow the Sixth Avenue Line express tracks to be connected, from July 11 to August 30, 1966, F trains terminated at Second Avenue instead of at the center tracks at Broadway–Lafayette Street.

== Opening ==
The Manhattan Bridge connection and the Grand Street station opened on November 26, 1967, almost exactly 10 years after the project began. The Williamsburg Bridge connection and 57th Street station opened on July 1, 1968. The opening of the connection allowed greater flexibility in routings along BMT lines in Brooklyn. The Manhattan Bridge connection eliminated a bottleneck where trains using three of the four BMT Southern Division lines from Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue, were forced to use the Manhattan Bridge or the Montague Street Tunnel before going onto the BMT Broadway Line to Midtown Manhattan (or onto the Nassau Street Loop). The new connection thus permitted IND Sixth Avenue Line trains from Midtown to use the BMT lines toward Coney Island, while preserving Nassau Street service via the Montague Street Tunnel. Trains from the BMT Jamaica Line and other BMT Eastern Division lines also gained a direct connection to Midtown Manhattan via the Sixth Avenue Line by using the Williamsburg Bridge connection.

The Chrystie Street Connection was the first actual integration of BMT and IND lines after the unification of all major lines under New York City municipal ownership in 1940. Prior to that, the nearest integration of the two previous systems was the operation of BMT trains over part of the IND Queens Boulevard Line via the BMT 60th Street Tunnel Connection connecting Lexington Avenue/59th Street on the BMT Broadway Line to Queens Plaza on the IND Queens Boulevard Line in 1955. In that case, however, BMT trains operated on the IND by trackage rights, using BMT equipment and crews.

==Service changes==
Two major service changes were inaugurated with the opening of the connection. The first went into effect on Sunday, November 26, 1967, when the Manhattan Bridge connection opened. The second occurred on Monday, July 1, 1968, when the Williamsburg Bridge connection opened. Additionally, for the 1967 opening, every service in the system was labeled with a letter or number and a color.

===Original changes===

====Changes following the Manhattan Bridge connection opening====

On November 15, 1967, the TA published a subway map showing which routes would be changed when the Manhattan Bridge connection opened. After 940 new signs had already been installed across the New York City Subway system, mayor John Lindsay wrote a letter to the TA in an attempt to delay the planned route changes. Lindsay dropped his objection on November 22, just hours before workers started installing heavy equipment to reroute the tracks. Two days later, a New York state judge dismissed a lawsuit against the route changes.

The opening of the Manhattan Bridge connection on November 26, 1967, was concurrent with the opening of the new express tracks on the Sixth Avenue Line between West Fourth Street–Washington Square and 34th Street, providing additional capacity for the extra trains on the IND via the connection. The following service changes were made, affecting about 200,000 passengers:
* The rush-hour only BB, which had run between Washington Heights–168th Street on the IND Eighth Avenue Line and 34th Street, was relabeled the B. It was extended via the new Sixth Avenue Line express tracks and the Chrystie Street Connection, then express on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and local on the BMT West End Line, terminating at Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. This latter segment replaced the T (express via Bridge) and TT (local via Tunnel) services, leaving only the TT West End Shuttle from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line running to Coney Island during late evenings, late nights and all day Sundays. B service was added during middays, early evenings, and the same time on Saturdays, but only south of West Fourth Street – Washington Square.
* The Q (BMT Brighton Line express) service was &quot;absorbed&quot; by a rerouted D, which used the Sixth Avenue Line local tracks (except rush hours, when it ran express). It used the Chrystie Street Connection to the BMT Brighton Line to Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue (running express in Brooklyn from morning rush hours through early evenings). Formerly, the Q had run local in Brooklyn (except during morning rush hours and early evenings) and express on the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan, terminating at 57th Street. The pre-1967 Q ran only weekdays until the mid-evening. The D had previously used the Sixth Avenue Line and IND Culver Line to Coney Island; this service was replaced by the F (see below).
* The EE service was added, running weekday rush hours, middays and early evenings, as a local train between Forest Hills–71st Avenue on the IND Queens Boulevard Line and Whitehall Street–South Ferry on the Broadway Line via the BMT 60th Street Tunnel Connection and the Broadway Line in Manhattan. This replaced the RR, which had formerly used the 60th Street connection during the same times (and was cut back to 57th Street in Manhattan other times). The RR was rerouted to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard full-time. The QT (Q via Tunnel) and QB (Q via Bridge) had served Astoria from the BMT Brighton Line; the QT was partly replaced with the QJ (Q via Jamaica; see below), and the QB was truncated to 57th Street for rush hour-only service. The D (see above) now served the Brighton Line.
* In a major rerouting affecting Queens riders, the F train was considerably extended from its original terminal stops, Broadway–Lafayette Street (morning rush hour to early evening) and 34th Street-Herald Square on the Sixth Avenue Line (other times), into Brooklyn to Stillwell Avenue along the Culver Line (previously serviced by the D). It continued to run express east of Forest Hills–71st Avenue only during rush hours. For the first time, riders from central Queens had a one-seat ride to southern Brooklyn destinations and Coney Island.
* The QJ was added as a rerouting of the old QT, combined with an extension of the old J Jamaica Express, entering Manhattan via the tunnel and extending via the BMT Jamaica Line to 168th Street. Its service hours remained the same, running from morning rush hours through early evening. It continued to run express in western Brooklyn and skip-stop in morning rush hours only in eastern Brooklyn.
* The RJ (R via Jamaica) service was added as an extension of former RR special service on the Nassau Street line, continuing local along the Jamaica Line to 168th Street. It operated only during rush hours.

* The NX was added for a &quot;super-express&quot; service from Brighton Beach through the Stillwell Avenue terminal (the only service to do so) and along the BMT Sea Beach Line&#x27;s middle express tracks and Fourth Avenue Line to 57th Street in Manhattan.
* A free transfer was established between the Atlantic Avenue on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and Atlantic Avenue on the BMT Brighton Line. While these two stations were both adjacent to the LIRR Atlantic Terminal and each other, their respective fare-control zones were separated at the time.

These changes were reportedly so confusing to some motormen that on November 28, 1967, a motorman intending to operate a train along the new D route via Grand Street accidentally took his train to Canal Street, necessitating the discharge of 800 passengers from the train during a busy rush hour. Reaction among passengers was mixed, with one passenger hugging a conductor after the opening of the new Grand Street station in Manhattan, while another passenger complained about having to take a slow local train in Brooklyn.

====Changes following the Williamsburg Bridge connection opening====
The following changes went into effect on July 1, 1968, concurrent with the opening of the 57th Street station at Sixth Avenue and the bridge connection:
* The KK service commenced between the new 57th Street station at Sixth Avenue and 168th Street in Jamaica. It operated only during rush hours, running skip-stop with the QJ on the BMT Jamaica Line east of Broadway Junction and then local into Manhattan. In Brooklyn, the KK (rush hours) and QJ (other times) replaced the JJ service, which was discontinued. The KK served &quot;A&quot; stops on the skip-stop portion of the BMT Jamaica Line, and the QJ served &quot;B&quot; stops. This skip-stop pattern, which had operated only in morning rush hours, was extended into afternoon rush hours, but still ran only in the peak direction.
* The B service was extended during non-rush hours from its former terminus at West Fourth Street–Washington Square to the new 57th Street station, using the local tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line. Rush hour trains continued on the established route to Washington Heights–168th Street via the express tracks (and the local tracks of the IND Eighth Avenue Line). The TT shuttle on the BMT West End Line in late evenings, late nights and all day Sunday, was discontinued and replaced by additional B service.
* The D service now bypassed 14th Street and 23rd Street via the express tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line at all times. It had previously done this only during rush hours. This service is taken over by the B and KK.
* The M (rush hour service) was extended from Chambers Street to Broad Street due to the additional capacity available from the rerouting of the JJ (as the KK).
* A free transfer was added between 42nd Street–Bryant Park on the IND Sixth Avenue Line and Fifth Avenue on the IRT Flushing Line from 5 AM to 10 PM weekdays. A passageway connecting the stations directly was built later on, and opened in 1972.

The following adjustments to the new service were put into effect on August 18, 1968:
* The D service was truncated to Brighton Beach when it ran express on the BMT Brighton Line (morning rush hours through early evenings). The QB (rush-hour peak direction only) and QJ (morning rush hours through early evenings) were extended from Brighton Beach to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue.
* The F ran express on the IND Culver Line during rush hours north of Church Avenue. Several peak-direction rush hour trains were truncated to Kings Highway; the rest provide express service north of Kings Highway. The GG train was extended to Church Avenue during rush hours to replace F local service, but was cut back to Smith–Ninth Streets on January 18, 1976.

===Later changes===

These new services began to unravel in response to commuter complaints about the various routings. Many of the new extensions like the NX and RJ quickly disappeared (April 12, 1968, and June 28, 1968, respectively), although the RJ was replaced with a shorter rush hour R service between Chambers Street and 95th Street-4th Avenue in Brooklyn. The KK (since renamed the K) was discontinued in 1976 as a money-saving measure, ending service via the Williamsburg Bridge connection. Reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge occurred from 1986 to 1988, in 1995, and from 2001 to 2004. At times, this made the Chrystie Street Connection unavailable for through trains, and made the Grand Street station a terminal for Grand Street Shuttle service to Broadway–Lafayette Street. The Manhattan Bridge reopened fully in 2004.

===Current service routing===
The Chrystie Street Connection returned to full revenue service on June 28, 2010. The Manhattan Bridge connection continues to be used by the B and D services. The Williamsburg Bridge connection is now used by the M, which had formerly traveled down the BMT Nassau Street Line. In June 2010, as part of a round of service cuts, the M was rerouted via Chrystie Street onto the IND Sixth Avenue Line, continuing along the discontinued V service&#x27;s former routing north of Broadway–Lafayette Street.

==Proposed Second Avenue Subway connections==
As a road, Chrystie Street extends northward beyond Houston Street to become Manhattan&#x27;s Second Avenue, and the Chrystie Street Connection was the first part of the long-planned Second Avenue Subway to be opened to service. The connection is one of several vestiges of early efforts to build the Second Avenue Subway, and before the connection was built, the original IND construction for the line included a recession in the ceiling at Second Avenue station and a short tunnel under Bowery.

The Chrystie Street Connection comprises two of the six parts of the Second Avenue Subway that were built in the 1960s and 1970s—the other four parts being the BMT 63rd Street Line, two unused subway segments under Second Avenue in East Harlem (one of which was connected to the 63rd Street line for Phase 1 of the Second Avenue line, which opened in 2017), and an unused subway segment under Confucius Plaza just to the south. The Chrystie Street Connection would have facilitated cross-platform and track interchanges between the Second and Sixth Avenue lines at Grand Street. Under current plans, Phase 4 of the future Second Avenue Subway will be built below the existing Sixth Avenue tracks.

<doc id="1180941" wikidata="Q7494482" url="?curid=1180941" title="Shepherd Park">
<text>Shepherd Park is a neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. In the years following World War II, restrictive covenants which had prevented Jews and African Americans from purchasing homes in the neighborhood were no longer enforced, and the neighborhood became largely Jewish and African American. Over the past 40 years, the Jewish population of the neighborhood has declined (though it is now increasing again) but the neighborhood has continued to support a thriving upper and middle class African American community. The Shepherd Park Citizens Association and Neighbors Inc. led efforts to stem white flight from the neighborhood in the 1960s and 1970s, and it has remained a continuously integrated neighborhood, with very active and inclusive civic groups.

Shepherd Park and the rest of Ward 4 were represented in the Council of the District of Columbia by Muriel Bowser, until her election as Mayor of the District of Columbia in the fall of 2014. It is home to a number of prominent people, including former NAACP President Benjamin Jealous. A number of judges, professors, newspaper reporters, and doctors also live in the community.

==Geography==
The northern line of the neighborhood is defined by Eastern Avenue NW, which divides Shepherd Park from Silver Spring, Maryland. The neighborhood is further bounded at the south by Parks at Walter Reed (the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center), at the east by Georgia Avenue NW, and the west by 16th Street NW.

Most east-west streets are named after flowers, shrubs, and trees. Iris Street, Kalmia Road, and Geranium Street are but a few flower-inspired street names.

Georgia Avenue is the only commercial corridor near the neighborhood. Downtown Silver Spring and Rock Creek Park are both within walking distance. The neighborhood is served by bus services on Georgia Ave. and 16th Street, and the Silver Spring and Takoma Park Metros are equidistant, both approximately one mile away.

Local architecture includes Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival houses; bungalows and other early-20th-century vernacular styles; and mid-century ramblers. There is a significant concentration of mail-order kit houses by the Lewis Manufacturing Company and by Sears in the southeast corner of the neighborhood.

==History==
The neighborhood takes its name from its most famous resident: Alexander Robey Shepherd, the governor of the then-Territory of DC from 1873 to 1874. The neighborhood was originally called Sixteenth Street Heights. Part of the neighborhood was renamed Shepherd Park in 1926 when developer L.E. Breuninger proposed 200 new homes. His first model home was built in the new Shepherd Park was 7707 13th St., NW.

Shortly before becoming governor (in 1868), Shepherd built a grand Second Empire-style Victorian that once stood near the corner of Floral and 14th Street. (The carriage house still stands in the alley off of Floral, entrance across from the modern house.) Shepherd chose the location because of its elevation and its proximity to Rock Creek.

Shepherd dubbed his large country home &quot;Bleak House&quot; after the Dickens novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;, which he and his wife were reading at the time of their home&#x27;s construction. The mansion was demolished in 1916.

Shepherd owned a plant nursery in the District of Columbia, which enabled the 60,000 trees he had planted. His nursery led to a variety of wild flowers that still thrive in the yards of city residents. It is also the genesis of the streets in Shepherd Park being named for flowers.

The Shepherd Park Citizens Association formed 1917 to petition the government to build a neighborhood elementary school and pave 16th Street between Alaska Avenue and the District line.

After developers acquired the land around 1911, they designed it so that the new homes would sit on large tracts of land, and they advertised the location as a &quot;high-class&quot; neighborhood. The developers made sure to retain the large trees in the neighborhood when building the streets. The developers also made sure that the land was bound by covenants prohibiting its sale to blacks and Jews. The covenants stood until after World War II when the Supreme Court struck them down as unconstitutional. At that point, speculators would move a black family into a house on a block that otherwise had white residents. Speculators would then tell the white residents that property values would imminently fall and pressure the white families to sell their homes to the speculators. The speculators would then sell the homes to other black families at large profits. This was called blockbusting. Starting in 1958, the Shepherd Park Citizens Association and Neighbors Inc led efforts to fight blockbusting and maintain the integrated nature of the neighborhood in the 1960s and 1970s. It is one of the only neighborhoods on the east side of Rock Creek Park where white flight was stemmed in those years.

In 1973, 7 family members of Hamaas Abdul Khaalis family were murdered at 7700 16th Street NW, which had been purchased by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and donated for use of the Hanafi Muslims.

In 1985, residents learned that the owner of an apartment building on Georgia Avenue was close to selling the land for a Wendy&#x27;s to be built on it. Residents protested, saying that the neighborhood needed a library much more than another fast food location. The District Council decided to build a library on the site instead, and the library opened in 1990. Named the Juanita E. Thornton/Shepherd Park Library, it is named after the neighborhood activist who led the neighborhood association in its efforts to have the library built there.

<text>The Illinois Routes are the highways in the State Highway System of the U.S. state of Illinois that are not simultaneously part of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highway System. These highways are maintained by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), with the exception of Illinois Route 390 and parts of Illinois Route 56 and Illinois Route 110, which are maintained by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA), and all routes that enter the Chicago City Limits are maintained by the Chicago Department of Transportation.

==History==
Illinois&#x27;s state route numbers originated in 1918 as State Bond Issues 1 through 46, used to finance the new roads. The numbers of the bond issues were then used to mark the highway routes along the way. Another series of bond issues were authorized in 1924 (47–185) and again were used to mark the roads they paid for. After that the route numbers evolved into a separate system. The State Bond Issue numbers (SBI) remained as inventory designations on the original routes even after the numbered portion was changed, deleted or rerouted. These SBI numbers remain on IDOT district maps to this day and are used along with other designations for bid requests and other official documents.

During the middle part of the 20th century the state numbered routes expanded to new roads around the state. When the United States Numbered Highway System was introduced in the late 1920s many of the new US Routes were already part of the state system and the US number was just added to signposts. During 1930s as the US Highway System matured, redundant state numbers were often removed from US Routes. During 1950s and into 1980s, as the Interstate Highway System started to supplant many US Routes, redundant numbers were removed or replaced with state numbers. After the original Interstate Highways were substantially completed in the early 1970s many state (and US) routes, especially in the Chicago metro area, were removed or shortened as unnecessary.

While US and Interstate systems use even numbers for primary east–west routes and odd for north–south, there is no such rule for Illinois route numbers. Also, three-digit route numbers are usually not related to their one- or two-digit counterpart. There are several exceptions to this however.

==General notes==
Illinois has used route numbers from IL 1 through IL 186 inclusive as well as many others up to IL 594.

Illinois has used letter suffixes on several state highways, including &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;. &quot;C&quot;, &quot;N&quot; (for north) and &quot;S&quot; (for south). A, B and C suffixes were used for spurs of a nearby route, the N and S were legs of IL 113 on either side of the Kankakee River.

Illinois has also used special routes, such as &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Alternate&quot;, &quot;City&quot;, &quot;Bypass&quot; and &quot;Truck&quot; on state-numbered highways. Only a pair of truck routes as well as a batch of Business Routes remain in Illinois, all other special state highways have been renumbered or the markers removed.

== Primary routes ==
































































































==Inventory routes==

Illinois uses unique &quot;inventory number&quot; signage on rural roads that are owned or maintained by IDOT but may or may not be part of the US or Illinois highway systems. These number signs are white squares, with a green divided circle. The county name is within the dividing line, the mileage from the county line is in the lower half and the inventory or route number in the upper. Number series vary between IDOT Districts, in some areas the number used on otherwise unnumbered routes are a derivative of the former number (i.e.: &quot;913&quot; used on a section of former IL 13) or a sequential number unrelated to the original or former number (such as the 8900 series numbers used in the Galesburg–Macomb area). On many US and Illinois Routes the posted number is used, with or without a preceding descriptor. These signs are not intended for navigation as route numbers are but rather as guides for IDOT crews and contractors and to identify specific intersections, culverts or other features.

<text>Jeffrey Thomas Porcaro (April 1, 1954 – August 5, 1992) was an American drummer. He is best known for being the co-founder and drummer of the rock band Toto, but is also one of the most recorded session musicians in history, working on hundreds of albums and thousands of sessions. While already an established studio player in the 1970s, he came to prominence in the United States as the drummer on the Steely Dan album &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1975).

AllMusic characterized Porcaro as &quot;arguably the most highly regarded studio drummer in rock from the mid-&#x27;70s to the early &#x27;90s&quot; and said that &quot;it is no exaggeration to say that the sound of mainstream pop/rock drumming in the 1980s was, to a large extent, the sound of Jeff Porcaro.&quot; He was posthumously inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Early life==
Jeffrey Thomas Porcaro was born on April 1, 1954, in Hartford, Connecticut, the eldest son of Los Angeles session percussionist Joe Porcaro (1930–2020) and his wife, Eileen. His younger brother Mike was a successful bassist and was a member of the band Toto. Younger brother Steve is still a studio musician and was also a member of Toto. Porcaro was raised in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and attended Ulysses S. Grant High School. Jeff&#x27;s youngest sibling was sister Joleen, born in 1960.

==Career==
Porcaro began playing drums at the age of seven. Lessons came from his father Joe Porcaro, followed by further studies with Bob Zimmitti and Richie Lepore. When he was seventeen, he got his first professional gig playing in Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s touring band. He later called Jim Keltner and Jim Gordon his idols at that time. During his twenties, Porcaro played on hundreds of albums, including several for Steely Dan. He toured with Boz Scaggs before co-founding Toto with his brother Steve and childhood friends Steve Lukather and David Paich. Jeff Porcaro is renowned among drummers for the drum pattern he used on the Grammy Award-winning Toto song &quot;Rosanna&quot;, from the album &quot;Toto IV&quot;. The drum pattern, called the Half-Time Shuffle Groove, was originally created by drummer Bernard Purdie, who called it the &quot;Purdie Shuffle.&quot; Porcaro created his own version of this groove by blending the aforementioned shuffle with John Bonham&#x27;s groove heard in the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot;, while keeping a Bo Diddley beat on the bass drum. Porcaro describes this groove in detail on a Star Licks video (now DVD) he created shortly after &quot;Rosanna&quot; became popular.

Besides his work with Toto, he was also a highly sought session musician. Porcaro collaborated with many of the biggest names in music, including George Benson, Nik Kershaw, Tommy Bolin, Larry Carlton, Eric Carmen, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Christopher Cross, Andrew Gold, Miles Davis, Dire Straits, Donald Fagen, Stan Getz, Herb Alpert, David Gilmour, James Newton Howard, Al Jarreau, Elton John, Leo Sayer, Greg Lake, Rickie Lee Jones, Paul McCartney, Michael McDonald, the Bee Gees, Lynn Anderson, Sérgio Mendes, Jim Messina, Pink Floyd, Lee Ritenour, Diana Ross, Boz Scaggs, Hoyt Axton, Seals and Crofts, Bruce Springsteen, Steely Dan, Barbra Streisand, Richard Marx, Warren Zevon, Don Henley, David Foster, Donna Summer, Frankie Valli and Joe Walsh. Porcaro contributed drums to four tracks on Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; and also played on the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album hit &quot;Heal the World&quot;. He also played on 10cc&#x27;s &quot;...Meanwhile&quot; (1992). Porcaro featured on Al Stewart&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;24 Carrots&quot;. On the 1993 &quot;10cc Alive&quot; album, recorded after his death, the band dedicated &quot;The Stars Didn&#x27;t Show&quot; to him.

Richard Marx dedicated the song &quot;One Man&quot; to him and said Porcaro was the best drummer he had ever worked with. Michael Jackson made a dedication to Porcaro in the liner notes for his 1995 album &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
On October 22, 1983, Porcaro married Susan Norris, a Los Angeles television broadcaster at KABC-TV. Together, they had three sons: Christopher Joseph (1984), Miles Edwin Crawford (1986–2017) and Nico Hendrix (1991).

Porcaro died at Humana Hospital-West Hills on the evening of August 5, 1992, at the age of 38 after falling ill while spraying insecticide in the yard of his Hidden Hills home. Initially his death was wrongly attributed to a heart attack caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled pesticide. Bandmate Steve Lukather and Porcaro&#x27;s wife stated they believed that Porcaro had also been suffering from a long-standing heart condition, exacerbated by heavy smoking, which contributed to his death. Lukather noted that several members of Porcaro&#x27;s family had died at a young age due to heart disease. However, the LA county coroner ruled out an accident and determined a heart attack due to occlusive coronary artery disease caused by atherosclerosis resulting from cocaine use. 

Porcaro&#x27;s tombstone was inscribed with the following epitaph, comprising lyrics from the &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; track &quot;Wings of Time&quot;: &quot;Our love doesn&#x27;t end here; it lives forever on the Wings of Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Jeff Porcaro Memorial Fund was established to benefit the music and art departments of Grant High School in Los Angeles, where he was a student in the early 1970s. A memorial concert took place at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles on December 14, 1992, with an all-star line-up that included George Harrison, Boz Scaggs, Donald Fagen, Don Henley, Michael McDonald, David Crosby, Eddie Van Halen and the members of Toto. The proceeds of the concert were used to establish an education trust fund for Porcaro&#x27;s sons.

<text>Leroy Robertson (December 21, 1896 – July 25, 1971) was an American composer and music educator.

Robertson was born in Fountain Green, Utah. One of his earliest instructors was Anthony C. Lund. He graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music with a certificate in public school music and diplomas in composition, violin (after studies with Harrison Keller), and piano in 1923, the same year he was awarded the Endicott prize for &quot;Overture in E Minor&quot;. Following his graduation, Robertson taught music at North Cache High School in Richmond, Utah and at Pleasant Grove High School in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where he also supervised music in the Alpine School District.

Robertson was appointed to the music faculty at Brigham Young University in 1925. He soon became professor and chairman of the music department, a position he held until 1948. In 1930, Robertson studied with Ernest Bloch at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He would continue his studies with Bloch in Roveredo Capriasca, Switzerland in 1932, and with Hugo Leichtentritt in Berlin, Germany, in 1933. Robertson received a BA degree and an MA degree from Brigham Young University in June 1933.

Between 1933-1945, Robertson composed several works for piano and organ, as well as strings, including his &quot;Songs from the Shadow&quot;, &quot;Fantasia for the Organ&quot;, &quot;String Quartet&quot;, and &quot;Punch and Judy Overture&quot;. It was also during this period that he began work on the &quot;Oratorio from the Book of Mormon&quot;. In 1945, Robertson was awarded the Utah Institute of Fine Arts Award for &quot;Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra&quot;. Robertson won the Reichhold Award of $25,000 for &quot;Trilogy for Orchestra&quot; in 1947, which was premiered by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with Karl Krueger conducting. The following year, he was appointed professor and chairman of the music department at the University of Utah, a position he held until 1962. Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Violin and Orchestra&quot; premiered under Maurice Abravanel during the centennial of the University of Utah in 1950 with Utah Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster Tibor Zelig as soloist. In 1954, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.

Robertson was instrumental in the promotion of the Utah Symphony and of classical music in Salt Lake City.

He is best known for his &quot;Oratorio from the Book of Mormon&quot;, which premiered in 1953. The setting of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer from that oratorio was recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and released as a 45 single on the flip side of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, which hit the top 50 charts.

Among Robertson&#x27;s works in the 1948 hymnal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the music for &quot;Up! Arouse Thee, O Beautiful Zion&quot;, with words by Emily H. Woodmansee. The 1985 edition of the Church&#x27;s hymnal includes eight of Robertson&#x27;s hymns, including &quot;On This Day of Joy and Gladness&quot; (hymn #64, both words and music by Robertson), &quot;Let Earth&#x27;s Inhabitants Rejoice&quot; (hymn #53), &quot;&quot;Great King of Heaven&quot; (hymn #63), &quot;God of Our Fathers, Known of Old&quot; (hymn #80), &quot;I&#x27;m A Pilgrim, I&#x27;m A Stranger&quot; (hymn #121), &quot;Upon The Cross Of Calvary&quot; (hymn #184), &quot;We Love Thy House, Oh God&quot; (hymn #247) and &quot;Go Ye Messengers of Glory&quot; (hymn #262).

<text>Cyril Royston Guyton Bassett, VC (3 January 18929 January 1983) was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded to British and Empire forces at the time. He was the only soldier serving with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) to be awarded the VC in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War.

Born in Auckland, Bassett was a bank worker when the First World War began. A member of New Zealand&#x27;s Territorial Force, he volunteered for service abroad with NZEF and was posted to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company as a sapper. He saw action on the opening day of the Gallipoli Campaign, and during the Battle of Chunuk Bair he performed the actions that led to his award of the VC. Medically evacuated due to sickness shortly after the battle, he later served on the Western Front and finished the war as a second lieutenant. Bassett returned to the banking profession but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War. He served on the Home Front and by the time he was taken off active duty in December 1943, he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District. When he retired from his banking career he became a justice of the peace in Devonport. He died in 1983 at the age of 91.

==Early life==

Cyril Royston Guyton Bassett was born on 3January 1892 in the Auckland suburb of Mount Eden, to a printer, Frederick Bassett, and his wife Harriet, Powley. Bassett attended Auckland Grammar School and then Auckland Technical College. After completing his formal education in 1908, he worked as a clerk for the National Bank of New Zealand. In 1909, he joined what later became the Territorial Force, the part-time military reserve, and was posted to the Auckland College Rifles. Two years later he transferred to the Auckland Divisional Signal Company.

==First World War==
When the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914, it was Bassett&#x27;s intention to join the Royal Navy, but his mother, whose family had a history of service in the British Army, convinced him to enlist in the New Zealand Military Forces. Bassett was not particularly tall and was initially rejected on the grounds of height. He persisted with his attempt to enlist, and joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) as a sapper in the Corps of New Zealand Engineers, assigned to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.

===Gallipoli===
Bassett embarked with the main body of the NZEF for the Middle East in October 1914. Initially based in Egypt, after a period of training, he landed at ANZAC Cove on 25 April 1915, the opening day of the Gallipoli campaign. Along with the other signallers of his unit, he was immediately set to work laying communication lines to the headquarters of the New Zealand and Australian Division. In early May, he, along with two other signallers, was noted in consideration for a gallantry award for their efforts in laying telephone wires while under heavy fire.

Later in the campaign, Bassett was promoted to corporal. In August 1915, a series of offensives against Turkish positions along the Gallipoli front was planned to break the stalemate that had developed since the initial landing. On 7August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked Chunuk Bair, a prominent hill overlooking the battlefield. The battle lasted for three days. Chunuk Bair was captured by the brigade&#x27;s Wellington Infantry Battalion on the second day, during which Bassett, in command of a section of five other signallers of his unit, laid down and maintained telephone lines between brigade headquarters and the front lines. Working on the exposed slopes leading up to Chunuk Bair, he braved continuous gunfire during this time armed with only a revolver and a bayonet. A bullet struck his boot and two more passed through the fabric of his tunic during the fighting, but he was not wounded.

After the battle, Basset&#x27;s name, along with those of the other five signallers of his section, was collected by Major Arthur Temperley of brigade headquarters, who nominated Bassett to receive the Victoria Cross (VC). A few days later, Bassett was evacuated from Gallipoli due to poor health. Suffering from dysentery, he spent several months recuperating at a hospital in Leicester and it was here that he was advised of his VC award. Instituted in 1856, the VC is the highest gallantry award that can be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read:
The citation incorrectly refers to Bassett&#x27;s actions on 7August; it was not until the following day that the Wellington Infantry Battalion captured Chunuk Bair. His VC was the first to be awarded to a soldier of the NZEF and he was the only one to receive it for actions during the Gallipoli Campaign. King George V presented him the VC at an investiture held at Buckingham Palace on 3February 1916. Bassett later remarked of the VC action, &quot;I reckon there must be some guardian angel looking after me, especially as one man was shot dead in front of me and another wounded just behind.&quot;

===Western Front===
In June 1916, Bassett rejoined his unit, by then on the Western Front in France as part of the New Zealand Division. Later that year, he participated in the Battle of the Somme, and in 1917 was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was wounded twice while on the Western Front; the first occasion was in October 1917, and the second was during the German spring offensive in March 1918, when an artillery barrage destroyed the headquarters of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, where he was the signals officer. The same barrage killed the brigade&#x27;s commander, Brigadier-General Harry Fulton. On extracting himself from the rubble of the headquarters, Bassett immediately set about reestablishing communications for which he was recommended for, but was not awarded, the Military Cross. With the war now over, he returned to New Zealand in late 1918 as the New Zealand Division started demobilising and was formally discharged from the NZEF in 1919.

==Interwar period and Second World War==

Bassett returned to his banking career after the war, managing branches of the National Bank in Auckland and later in Paeroa. He retained a link to the military, rejoining the Territorial Force shortly after his discharge from the NZEF but was placed on the retired list of officers in 1929. Three years previously, he had married Ruth Louise Grant in St David&#x27;s Church, Auckland; the couple had two children. By 1939 he was the manager of the Auckland Town Hall branch of the National Bank.

Called up for the National Military Reserve as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War, Bassett was placed on active duty in 1941 as a captain in the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals (RNZSigs). He was not required to serve overseas and instead he worked in signals on the Home Front in New Zealand. Promoted to major in February 1942, his active war service ended in December 1943. By then he had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District.

==Later life and legacy==

Bassett returned to the National Military Reserve from which he retired in 1948. As a civilian, he resumed his banking profession. He retired in 1952 but remained active in the community of Devonport, on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, as a justice of the peace. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. He died at Stanley Bay, in Auckland, on 9 January 1983, shortly after his 91st birthday; his ashes were buried at North Shore Memorial Park. He was survived by his wife Ruth and their two daughters. His VC, gifted to the RNZSigs upon his death, is displayed at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Several years earlier, Bassett had planted a pine tree, reportedly cultivated from a seedling taken from the area of the Battle of Lone Pine at Gallipoli, in front of the museum as part of an Anzac Day service.

According to his daughter, Bassett rarely spoke about his achievements, and she did not learn of her father&#x27;s award until she studied Gallipoli at primary school. He was modest and expressed embarrassment at being the only New Zealand VC recipient of the Gallipoli Campaign. He commented that &quot;when I got my medal I was disappointed to find I was the only New Zealander to get one at Gallipoli, because hundreds of Victoria Crosses should have been awarded there.&quot;

Bassett remains the only New Zealand signaller to have been awarded the VC and was a lifetime member of the Corps of Signals Association. In recognition of Bassett&#x27;s rank at the time of his award, the Bassett Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the most outstanding corporal in the RNZSigs. The trophy is a statue of Bassett on Chunuk Bair. An annual speech competition, run by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association and sponsored by the ANZ Bank, formerly the National Bank, for secondary school students is named for him. The winner travels to Gallipoli to attend the ANZAC Day commemorations.

<text>Scott Williams (born 1960) is an American comic book artist, best known for his work as an inker, and for his decades-long partnership with artist Jim Lee, both of whom began Homage Studios, collaborating on books including &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;WildCATs&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;WildC.A.T.s/X-Men&quot;, &quot;All-Star Batman and Robin&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot;. Williams has also inked the pencils of Whilce Portacio and Marc Silvestri, and books including &quot;Gen13&quot;.

==Career==
Regarding his influences, Williams stated in a 2020 interview with SyFy, &quot;I was a big Frank Miller and Klaus Janson fan on &quot;Daredevil&quot; and their whole run. As I was starting to get professional work and still figuring things out, I literally had Klaus Jansen comics laid out next to my drawing table so I could try to see what I could steal. And that&#x27;s actually what most artists do. They steal stuff and it&#x27;s a time-honored tradition. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you&#x27;re a penciler or an anchor out there, and you&#x27;re trying to figure out what you want to do, you don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel every single time. You can try to figure out what your favorite artists are doing and try to make parts of it your own. What will happen is you will eventually take whatever it is that you&#x27;re dissecting and you will make it your own and your own style will sort of morph and evolve into something hopefully new. And that&#x27;s basically what I did. My style came from a failure to adapt to Klaus Janson&#x27;s style.&quot; Other artists Williams cited as influences include Neal Adams and Tom Palmer.

In 2012 Williams received the Sinnott Hall of Fame Award by the Inkwell Awards.
His style of inking is done using a brush and a crow quill nib achieving precise thicknesses. He usually inks right over the original pencils of the artist and pays specific attention to highlighting key elements of the penciller&#x27;s work while adding depth by varying line quality and thickness.

<text>The 60th Street Tunnel Connection or 11th Street Cut is a short rapid transit line of the New York City Subway, within the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. It connects the 60th Street Tunnel under the East River (which connects to the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan) with the IND Queens Boulevard Line west of Queens Plaza. The 11th Street Connection name comes from the street above the split from the 60th Street Tunnel. The line does not have any stations, and carries trains at all times but late nights.

== History ==
The connection opened on December 1, 1955, and permitted BMT trains from Brooklyn to use the IND Queens Boulevard Line; the first service to do so was the &quot;Brighton Beach Local via Tunnel&quot; (1, now Q). This connection allowed for an increase of 20 trains per hour on Queens Boulevard. Unlike the later Chrystie Street Connection, this was of the nature of a trackage rights operation, without the mixing of BMT and IND equipment or crews, as opposed to a true operating integration.

===Service history===
The first service to use the connection was the daytime 1 local via Montague Street Tunnel, which became the QT in the early 1960s. The QT was rerouted to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard on January 1, 1961, and the RR was sent through the connection during daytime hours. The EE was created on November 26, 1967, when the Chrystie Street Connection opened and the RR moved back to Astoria. On August 27, 1976, the N was extended through the connection, absorbing the EE; this change sent late night and weekend trains through the tunnel for the first time. The N and R were swapped in Queens on May 24, 1987, taking the R through the connection in a move that reassigned a former BMT route (the R) to the IND&#x27;s Jamaica Yard (it had heretofore used the Coney Island Yard). Late night service was later truncated to 36th Street in Brooklyn, then later extended to Whitehall Street in Manhattan. The connection is not being used during late nights .

<text>The Eastside is an urban region in Los Angeles County, California. It includes the Los Angeles City neighborhoods east of the Los Angeles River—that is, Boyle Heights, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights—as well as unincorporated East Los Angeles.

==History==

East Los Angeles was founded in 1870 by John Strother Griffin (1816–1898), who was called &quot;the father of East Los Angeles&quot;. In late 1874 the two men offered an additional thirty-five acres, divided into 65x165-foot lots, for $150 each. They planned the laying out of streets of the present community of East Los Angeles and gifted East Side Park (the present Lincoln Park) to the city of Los Angeles.

The Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; defines the Eastside as comprising Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, and East Los Angeles. However, the boundaries are a matter of perennial discussion and debate among the residents of Los Angeles.

The Mapping L.A. definition corresponds to the traditional boundaries, but, beginning in the early 21st century, residents of some of the rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods west of Downtown Los Angeles but on the eastern side of Central Los Angeles, such as Echo Park and Silver Lake, began to refer to their neighborhoods as part of the Eastside. This debate generated some friction, which, according to Ali Modarres, an expert on the geography of Los Angeles from the University of Washington Tacoma, is to be expected because neighborhood names are &quot;full of meaning, nuances, history, cultural and political relationships&quot;. Eric Garcetti, former mayor of Los Angeles and a fourth generation resident, is a traditionalist, stating that &quot;true east is east of downtown&quot;.

The trend led the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council to declare officially in February 2014 that Silver Lake is not part of the Eastside.

The Sixth Street Viaduct, also known as the Sixth Street Bridge was demolished. Prior to the demolition, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti recorded the rap song &quot;101SlowJam&quot;, backed by musicians from Roosevelt High School, and issued it via a video on his own YouTube channel. The public service announcement video advertised the closure of parts of the 101 Freeway to accommodate the demolition of the viaduct.

==Communities==

<text>The InterCity 225 is an electric push-pull high speed train in the United Kingdom, comprising a Class 91 electric locomotive, nine Mark 4 coaches and a Driving Van Trailer (DVT). The Class 91 locomotives were built by British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s Crewe Works as a spin-off from the Advanced Passenger Train project, which was abandoned during the 1980s, whilst the coaches and DVT were constructed by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham and Breda (under sub-contract) in Italy, again borrowing heavily from the Advanced Passenger Train. The trains were designed to operate at up to in regular service, but are limited to principally due to a lack of cab signalling and the limitations of the current overhead line equipment. They were introduced into service between 1989 and 1991 for intercity services on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from to , and Edinburgh.

==History==
===Background===
The origin of the InterCity 225 is closely associated with the East Coast Main Line (ECML) that it has been primarily operated upon. During the 1950s, British Rail had considered electrification of the ECML to be of equal importance to the West Coast Main Line (WCML), but various political factors led to the envisioned electrification programme being delayed for decades; as an alternative, high-speed diesel traction, including the Deltic and InterCity 125, was introduced upon the route during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1970s, a working group of British Rail and Department for Transport officials determined that, out of all options for further electrification, the ECML represented the best value by far. Its in-house forecasts determined that increases in revenue and considerable reductions in energy and maintenance costs would occur by electrifying the line.

Accordingly, between 1976 and 1991, the ECML was electrified with overhead lines. The electrification was installed in two phases: The first phase between London (King&#x27;s Cross) and (including the Hertford Loop Line) was carried out between 1976 and 1978 as the Great Northern Suburban Electrification Project, using Mk.3A equipment, covering 30 miles in total. In 1984, the second phase commenced to electrify the Northern section to Edinburgh and Leeds. During the late 1980s, the programme was claimed to be the longest construction site in the world, spanning more than .

During 1989, the InterCity 225 was officially introduced to revenue service. That same year, the ECML had been energised through to York; two years later, electrification had reached Edinburgh, allowing electric services to begin on 8 July 1991, eight weeks later than scheduled. The ECML electrification programme was completed at a cost of £344.4million (equivalent to £ million in ), a minor overrun against its authorised expenditure of £331.9million. Forty per cent of the total cost was on new traction and rolling stock, and 60 per cent for the electrification of the line.

===Options and selection===
The electrification of the ECML necessitated the procurement of new high speed electric traction. The options and requirements for this trainset were hotly deliberated for a number of years. On 7 June 1978, the electric-powered prototype Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was unveiled; it was at one point intended for the APT to be the next major intercity express train. However, due to various factors including technical issues, the APT programme was curtailed during the summer of 1989. Shortly thereafter, two alternative options were explored, an electrified version of the InterCity 125 (known as the &quot;HST-E&quot;), and the mixed-traffic locomotive; these were both intended to a peak service speed of 125 mph.

Some officials within British Rail pushed for more demanding requirements for the future Intercity trainset; reportedly, BR&#x27;s Director of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (M&amp;EE) was a strong proponent for increasing the top speed to 140 mph. To facilitate this, tilting train technologies developed for the APT were explored. While BR&#x27;s board had approved the ordering of a single Class 89 as a prototype, the Strategy Committee queried why the type had been favoured over a proposed 80-tonne Bo-Bo locomotive. While the Class 89 was thought to be a low-risk option for multi-purpose traction, it offered little advantage over the existing in terms of speed. At the time, the 1950s era and electric locomotives were nearing the end of their viable service lives and were quite unreliable, but their withdrawal was effectively ruled out by a national shortage of newer electric traction, in part caused by the APT&#x27;s cancellation.

A key advantage of the InterCity 225 concept over a Class 89-hauled consist was the lower weight of the former, resulting in less slippage and greater acceleration over the latter. Appraisals also determined that the Class 89 was comparatively inferior in financial terms, in part due to the InterCity 225&#x27;s prospective compatibility with WCML traction, reducing its development costs. A further cost-saving measure was the decision to base the InterCity 225&#x27;s technologies on the APT, BR reportedly stated that it had derived 90% of the former&#x27;s engineering from the latter. Thus, the study group recommended that the InterCity 225 be pursued as the preferred option, while the Class 89 and HST-E initiatives serve as back-ups. Despite this, the HST-E effort was promptly aborted, while Brush Traction decided to de-prioritise work on the Class 89 after learning that it was unlikely to lead to volume production.

By spring 1984, favour was being given towards the adoption of a tilting carriage, tentatively designated as the Mk 4; this was viewed as superior to the existing Mk 3 and enabled a single design to be shared between the ECML and WCML. At one point, it was envisaged that the InterCity 225 would be ubiquitous, even potentially having the capability built into it to operate over the southern third-rail network and within the Channel Tunnel; by mid 1984, such fanciful ideas were curtailed. Furthermore, it was decided to reduce the freight haulage capabilities of the InterCity 225, as traction for this sector was instead intended to be served via other platforms. The emergence of the , derived from the existing Class 87, somewhat reduced the pressure for the InterCity 225, reducing the prospective numbers to be built of the latter. Without tilting carriages, it had little speed advantage over the Class 90 on the WCML.

It was decided to hold a competitive tender for the InterCity 225 programme; this measure was aimed at avoiding the difficulties experienced with the APT programme. A pre-qualification document was formalised, in which various requirements for the type were laid out; these included the need to perform mixed-traffic duties (day and night passenger, parcel and mail, and overnight heavy freight services), the haulage of both tilting and conventional rolling stock, a top speed of 225 km/h, a maximum cant deficiency of 9° without the provision of tilt equipment, and that the maximum unsprung mass could not exceed 1.8 tonnes. Furthermore, BR stated its readiness to sub-contract with the successful bidder for the supply of technical information, advice and testing. The prequalification document was issued to BREL, Brush Traction and the General Electric Company (GEC), as well as the French firm Alstom and Germany&#x27;s Krauss Maffei. The inclusion of foreign manufacturers was in part due to the limited domestic experience with trainsets capable of such high top speeds. A total of three companies, ASEA, Brush Traction and GEC, submitted tenders for the design and construction of the Class 91 locomotive.

On 14 February 1985, the BR board approved the substitution of the Class 91 for Class 89 for the ECML programme. The tendering process was relatively complex, but a decisive move appeared to have been GEC&#x27;s offer of a sub-contracting arrangement to BREL for the construction of the locomotive&#x27;s mechanical elements. It would be GEC&#x27;s submission that would be selected as the winner; after which a contract for the construction of 31 Class 91 locomotives, along with an option for 25 more for the WCML, was awarded during February 1986. Shortly thereafter, BREL established a production line for the type at its Crewe Works.

==Operations==
The InterCity 225 entered service with InterCity on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) in 1989. In service, the InterCity 225 sets were used alongside other rolling stock, including locomotives and electric multiple units. The displaced diesel trains were reallocated predominantly to the Midland Main Line. The InterCity 225&#x27;s introduction correlated with a significant increase in passenger numbers using the ECML within two years; one station recorded a 58 per cent increase in passengers.

The InterCity 225 was designed to achieve a peak service speed of ; during a test run in 1989 on Stoke Bank between Peterborough and Grantham, an InterCity 225 was recorded at a speed of . Its high speed capabilities were again demonstrated via a 3hours and 29minutes non-stop run between London and Edinburgh on 26 September 1991. British regulations have since required in-cab signalling on any train running at speeds above preventing such speeds from being legally attained in regular service. Thus, except on High Speed 1, which is equipped with cab signalling, British signalling does not allow any train, including the InterCity 225, to exceed in regular service, due to the impracticality of correctly observing lineside signals at high speed.

The InterCity 225 has also operated on the West Coast Main Line (WCML). In April 1992, one trainset achieved a new speed record of two hours, eight minutes between Manchester and London Euston, shaving 11 minutes off the 1966 record. During 1993, trials were operated to Liverpool and Manchester in connection with the InterCity 250 project.

In 1996, as part of the privatisation of British Rail, all InterCity 225s were sold to Eversholt Rail Group. Since then, the trains have been leased to all operators of the InterCity East Coast franchise, which is presently operated by London North Eastern Railway. Between 2000 and 2005, with support from GNER, Bombardier Transportation, HSBC Rail funded a complete rebuilding and refurbishment programme for both the Class 91 and Mark 4 coaches, called &quot;Project Mallard&quot;.

In July 2013, it was confirmed that the InterCity 225 fleet would be replaced as part of the Intercity Express Programme, a Department for Transport initiative to replace the InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 fleet on the East Coast Main Line and the Great Western Main Line. Introduced in the programme were Class 800 bi-mode and Class 801 electric trains from the Hitachi A-train family, of which the ECML sets were nicknamed &quot;Azuma&quot; after the Japanese word for &quot;East&quot;.

During their operation with Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) in 2016, there were plans to retain six to eight sets with shorter rakes for a new London to Edinburgh service, even with the &quot;Azuma&quot; takeover.

In June 2018, new operator London North Eastern Railway (LNER) inherited all 31 InterCity 225 sets from VTEC as part of the franchise. At this point, LNER had no intentions to retain any of the InterCity 225 sets due to high maintenance costs on the fleet. The first Class 800 entered service with LNER on 15 May 2019, allowing for the first withdrawal of an InterCity 225 set. The withdrawals have gradually continued as more of the new &quot;Azuma&quot; trains entered service and at the beginning of 2020, it was planned that the final InterCity 225 sets would leave LNER&#x27;s fleet by June 2020. However, LNER decided to retain seven sets until 2023 to allow for services to be increased in December 2021. From September 2020, they ceased operating north of York.
With LNER returning the majority of their InterCity 225 sets to Eversholt Rail Group, it has been announced that other companies would be obtaining some of the Mark 4 carriages and Driving Van Trailers. Transport For Wales have leased 12 Mark 4 carriages to replace Mark 3 coaches on its &quot;Premier Service&quot;. Prospective operator Grand Union proposed to operate the InterCity 225 on London Paddington to Cardiff Central services from December 2020 and London Euston to Stirling services from May 2021.

From May 2020, Grand Central were planning to begin using Mark 4 carriages on its new London Euston to Blackpool North services with Class 90 locomotives hauling six-carriage sets. However, these plans were subsequently axed as part of Grand Central&#x27;s recovery plan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After losing the West Coast Partnership franchise, Virgin Rail Group had proposed using InterCity 225s on an open access service from London Euston to Liverpool.

In September 2020, Eversholt and London North Eastern Railway extended their lease of seven IC225 sets, including ten Class 91 locomotives, to summer 2023, with an option to extend to summer 2024. It will be overhauled at the Wabtec Doncaster plant.

At the end of service on 15 January 2021, the remaining serviceable InterCity 225 sets went into storage temporarily as part of the East Coast Upgrade. Originally, the plan was to return the sets to service for 7 June 2021, but instead the first set re-entered service on 11 May 2021 for a short time due to a number of &quot;Azuma&quot; sets having to be taken out of service.

==Capacity and formation==
The formation of the InterCity 225 sets is below:

*Class 91 Electric Locomotive (North End)
*Coach B – Standard Class – 76 Seats – WC
*Coach C – Standard Class – 76 Seats – WC
*Coach D – Standard Class – 76 Seats – WC
*Coach E – Standard Class – 76 Seats – WC
*Coach F – Standard Class – 72 Seats – Accessible Toilet
*Coach H – Standard Class/Kitchen – 30 Seats – WC
*Coach K – First Class – 43 Seats – WC + 2 Crew Areas
*Coach L – First Class – 40 Seats – Accessible Toilet
*Coach M – First Class – 46 Seats – WC
*Coach P - Driving Van Trailer (London End) 

The total numbers of seats are 406 Standard and 129 First, giving the train an overall capacity of 535 seats.

===Scale models===
One of the first models of the IC225 in the UK was by Hornby Railways, after previously releasing an OO Gauge BR Class 91 locomotive in 1988. In 1990 Hornby Railways launched its first OO Gauge models of BR MK4 rolling coach stock, consisting of a BR Mk4 Driving Van Trailer (DVT), three BR MK4 coaches, a Tourist Open Coach (TSO), a First Open Coach (FO), and a Catering Service Car (RFM). Hornby Railways launched its first full model version containing a BR Class 91 locomotive, a BR MK4 Driving Van Trailer (DVT), and two MK4 Tourist Open Coaches as a complete train set in 1991.

<doc id="1180975" wikidata="Q268799" url="?curid=1180975" title="Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington">
<text>Kathleen Agnes Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington (; February 20, 1920 – May 13, 1948), also known as &quot;Kick&quot; Kennedy, was an American socialite. She was the second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald, a sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, and the wife of the Marquess of Hartington, heir apparent to the 10th Duke of Devonshire.

When her father was serving as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Kathleen made many friends in London and was the &quot;debutante of 1938&quot;. Working with the Red Cross, she began a romantic relationship with Lord Hartington, whom she married in May 1944. He was killed on active service in Belgium only four months later. Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948, flying to the south of France while on vacation with her new partner, the 8th Earl Fitzwilliam.

==Early life and education==
Kennedy was born on February 20, 1920, at home in Brookline, Massachusetts, the fourth child and second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald. She was nicknamed &quot;Kick&quot; because of her &quot;irrepressible nature&quot;. Kennedy was especially close to her older brother, John F. Kennedy, known as &quot;Jack&quot;. Her other siblings were Joseph Jr., Rosemary, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Ted. 

Kennedy was educated at Riverdale Country School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York City. She also attended Noroton Convent of the Sacred Heart in Noroton, Connecticut, and the Holy Child Convent in Neuilly, France. While the Kennedy daughters were not raised to have political ambitions like their brothers, they were nonetheless provided with many of the same educational and social opportunities, owing to their father&#x27;s powerful financial and political connections and influence. This was particularly the case when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Joseph as United States ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1938.

As a child, Kennedy was very athletic and played football with her brothers. An account cited that this stemmed from the ethos of competition that her father instilled on the young children. They were split into teams and would compete in sports at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Her optimism and high spirits attracted many suitors, some of whom were Jack&#x27;s closest friends. Eventually Kennedy started to date and had her first serious relationship with W. R. Grace and Company heir J. Peter Grace.

== Britain ==

Kathleen&#x27;s time in Britain during her father&#x27;s term as Ambassador dramatically influenced the remainder of her life. While living in England, she was educated in London at Queen&#x27;s College and quickly cultivated a wide circle of friends, both male and female, in British high society. She dated David Rockefeller and was declared the &quot;debutante of 1938&quot; by the English media when she made her debut at the Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Ball.

Following the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kick, who was staying at the family home in the south of France, had to rush to England with her friend Janey Kenyon Slaney. The Kennedy family, to save Joseph and daughter Rosemary, returned to the United States. Kathleen, having become very fond of England and the many friends she had made during her two years there, petitioned her parents to remain in London in spite of the coming danger. However, she was overruled by her father, and sailed back home in the early fall of 1939.

After returning to the U.S., Kennedy enrolled at the Finch School for a time, and then attended Florida Commercial College. In addition to her studies, she also began volunteering work for the American Red Cross. In 1941, she decided to leave school, and began working as a research assistant for Frank Waldrop, the executive editor for the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;. She later teamed with Inga Arvad, who wrote the &quot;Did You Happen to See...&quot; column, and was eventually given her own column where she reviewed films and plays.

== Marriage ==
In 1943, seeking a way to return to England, Kathleen signed up to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross. During her time in England, both before and particularly during the war, she grew increasingly more independent from her family and the Catholic Church to which they belonged. During this time, Kennedy began a romantic relationship with politician William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington (usually known to his family and friends as Billy Hartington). He was the eldest son and heir apparent of the 10th Duke of Devonshire.

The two had met and begun a friendship when she moved to England when her father was appointed American Ambassador. Despite objections from her mother, Kennedy and Lord Hartington reunited upon her return to England. Rose especially rejected their relationship because she saw that their marriage would break the laws of the Catholic Church by allowing Kathleen&#x27;s children to be raised in the Church of England (Anglican Communion) rather than the Catholic Church. Rose even tried to manipulate their relationship by keeping Kathleen away from Hartington and postponing a possible wedding. Regardless, Kathleen married Hartington on May 6, 1944, in a civil ceremony at the Caxton Hall Register Office. Kathleen&#x27;s eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., an officer in the U.S. Navy, to whom she had grown close during the last year of his life, as he was serving in Britain, was the only member of the family to attend the ceremony. Her second eldest brother, John, was still hospitalized due to a back injury incurred on the motor torpedo patrol boat &quot;PT-109&quot; in the South Pacific Ocean, and younger brother Robert F. Kennedy was in naval training. Three months later on August 12, Joe Jr. was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a top-secret bombing mission to Europe.

==Widowhood==
Kathleen, now Marchioness of Hartington, and Lord Hartington spent less than five weeks together before he went off to fight in France. Four months after their marriage, and less than a month after Joe Jr. was killed, Hartington was killed by a sniper during a battle with the Germans in Belgium. With his family&#x27;s blessing, he was buried close to where he fell. His younger brother Lord Andrew Cavendish, who was married to Deborah Mitford, youngest of the Mitford sisters, thus became the heir apparent to the dukedom, as Billy Hartington had left no heir. From then on she was styled as Kathleen, Dowager Marchioness of Hartington.

Popular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits and wit, Lady Hartington eventually became romantically involved with the 8th Earl Fitzwilliam, who was in the process of divorcing his wife. Once again, Rose Kennedy expressed her disapproval of her daughter&#x27;s suitor and warned Kathleen that she would be disowned and cut off financially if she married Lord Fitzwilliam. In May 1948, Kathleen learned that her father would be traveling to Paris. In an effort to gain his consent for her upcoming plans to marry Fitzwilliam, she decided to fly to Paris to meet with her father.

==Death==

On May 13, 1948, Lady Hartington and Lord Fitzwilliam were flying from Paris to the French Riviera for a vacation aboard a de Havilland DH.104 Dove. At 3:30 in the afternoon, their plane took off, reaching an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m). Approximately one hour into the flight, radio contact was lost with the plane when it entered the region near Vienne, which was also close to the center of a storm. The plane&#x27;s four occupants endured twenty minutes of severe turbulence which bounced their small plane up and down as much as several thousand feet at a time.

When they finally cleared the clouds, they instantly discovered the plane was in a dive and moments away from impact, and they attempted to pull up. The stress of the turbulence, coupled with the sudden change of direction, tore loose one of the wings, followed by both engines, and finally the tail. The plane&#x27;s fuselage then spun into the ground seconds later, coming to rest nose-down in a ravine, after striking terrain at Plateau du Coiron, near Saint-Bauzile, Ardèche, France. Lady Hartington was instantly killed, along with Fitzwilliam, the pilot Peter Townshend and the navigator Arthur Freeman.

She was buried on the Cavendish family burial grounds at St Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Edensor outside of Chatsworth, Derbyshire, England. Her father was the only family member to attend the funeral, arranged by the Devonshires. Rose Kennedy had refused to attend her daughter&#x27;s funeral, instead entering a hospital for medical reasons.

==Popular culture==
&quot;The Kennedy Debutante&quot;, a novelization of Kennedy&#x27;s life, was published by Berkley Books in 2018. Written by Kerri Maher, it was well received, including being named a &quot;Best Book of the Week&quot; by the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

Kathleen Kennedy is portrayed by Darleen Carr in the 1977 TV movie &quot;Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy&quot;, by Tracy Pollan in the 1990 TV miniseries &quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot;, and by Robin Tunney in the 1993 TV miniseries &quot;&quot;.

<text>The BMW 3 Series Compact is a car which was produced from 1994 through 2004 by BMW. It is a 3-door hatchback version of the BMW 3 Series through two generations, for the E36 platform in 1993 and E46 platform in 2001. Unlike most hatchback competitors which were transverse engine front-wheel drive, the 3 Series Compact uses the longitudinal engine rear-wheel drive layout.

In 2004, the 3 Series Compact was replaced by the 1 Series which encompassed 3-door and 5-door hatchback, coupé and convertible body styles (the coupé and convertible models have been marketed separately as the 2 Series since 2014) as BMW&#x27;s entry-level cars; a new nameplate was created since the 1 Series is smaller than the contemporary 3 Series despite sharing mechanical components. The 3 Series GT, introduced in 2013, is not a successor to the 3 Series Compact, despite also using a hatchback rear opening.

== First generation (E36; 1994) ==
Launched in March 1994, the E36 3 Series Compact (model code E36/5), was BMW&#x27;s first hatchback since the 2002 Touring model was discontinued in 1974. It reportedly cost BMW $500 million USD to develop the hatchback from the E36 platform.

From the front bumper to the A-pillar, the E36/5 is identical to the E36 saloon. From the A-pillar back, the E36/5 is unique. Although the overall length of the E36/5 is approximately shorter than the rest of the E36 3 Series range, the length of the wheelbase is the same. The doors with framed windows are unique to the E36/5, rather than adopting those of the E36 saloon/wagon or the frameless ones of the E36 coupé.

The interior is mostly similar to the E36 saloon models, apart from the folding rear seats and dashboard which share some elements with the previous generation E30 3 Series. Some cost-cutting was employed in the E36/5 dashboard such as manual air conditioning, compared to the rest of the E36 lineup which had automatic climate control. 

The E36/5 front suspension uses the E36&#x27;s MacPherson strut design, while the rear suspension uses a semi-trailing arm from the previous generation E30 models instead of the Z-Axle multi-link suspension used by the rest of the E36 range. The E36/5&#x27;s rear suspension arrangement - which was also used on the Z3 - was more compact and cheaper to produce. Some reviewers believed that this arrangement caused the E36/5&#x27;s to be prone to oversteer.

The launch models were powered by four-cylinder petrol engines, with the range expanded over the years to include a four-cylinder compressed natural gas engine, four-cylinder diesel engines, and six-cylinder petrol engines. In North America, the sole model available was the 318ti, initially powered by a DOHC 1.8 litre, inline-four BMW M42 engine. In 1996, in conjunction with making the car compliant with OBD-II, the M42 was replaced by the 1.9-litre M44 engine.

A large sunroof, covered by a folding canvas roof was available from mid-1995. This model was known as either the &quot;California Top Edition&quot; or the &quot;Open Air Edition&quot;.

In September 1996 (for model year 1997), the 3 Series Compact received a facelift in line with the remainder of the E36 range. Changes included revised tail-lights, grille, bumpers and mirrors.

=== Models ===

* Bivalent drive: The 316g can run either on gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). when running on gasoline.

==== M3 Compact prototype ====
In 1996, to celebrate the 50th birthday of the German automobile magazine &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot;, BMW M hand-built one M3 Compact. The car embodied all the technical and optical characteristics of the standard E36 M3, but in the compact body. Quad exhaust tips, Recaro sports seats, four-point seatbelts, an Alcantara steering wheel and gear lever were specific for this model.

=== Reception and sales figures ===
The E36 Compact received a positive reception, as it retained the ride/handling compromise of the saloon and coupe, with the Compact being more responsive (due to lighter weight) and more prone to oversteer (due to its different suspension), while also having a practical cargo hold. The pricing was also attractive, as the North American base price of the Compact (318ti) was $20,370 USD which undercut the next-cheapest BMW 3 Series (the 318i saloon) by $5070 USD. 

The E36 Compact was popular in its home market in Europe, which prompted rival Mercedes-Benz to include a hatchback style for its C-Class lineup, known as the C-Class SportCoupé. Based on the success of the Saab 900 and Acura Integra, BMW imported the E36 Compact for North America in late 1994 (for the 1995 model year) but ceased in 1999 after a comparatively short four-year run due to a combination of poor sales, and BMW&#x27;s decision to phase out all four-cylinder vehicles in the United States. The failure of the E36 Compact precluded the E46 Compact&#x27;s entry into the North American market, and prompted BMW to reconfigure the BMW Compact&#x27;s successor, the BMW 1 Series, from a liftback to a coupe before attempting to market the car in North America again. Similarly, the C-Class SportCoupé had a short sales run in North America and was withdrawn from that market while the saloon/wagon remained available.

The total production for 1993 to 1999 (ie excluding 2000, the final year of production) is 371,498.

==Second generation (E46/5; 2001)==

The 3 Series Compact was redesigned using the then-new E46 platform. This updated Compact has the model code E46/5. It was first presented at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, and went on sale in European markets in June 2001.

As per the rest of the E46 range, the wheelbase was increased by . The overall length is also increased by .

The exterior styling has several differences to the rest of the E46 3 Series range, notably the distinctive headlights and tail-lights. There is a unique set of doors with framed windows for the E46/5, rather than adopting those of the E46 saloon/wagon or the frameless ones of the E46 coupé. Mechanically, the Compact shares many elements with the rest of the E46 range, however the steering rack has a faster ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.rac.co.uk E46/5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The E46/5 was not sold in North America as its predecessor didn&#x27;t prove to be a sales success in that market. The E46/5 was not as successful as the E36/5, even though BMW had fixed many of the E36/5&#x27;s shortcomings (limited range of engines, rear-seating room). While lauded as a driver&#x27;s car, the E46/5 received some criticism for its unique headlights and tail-lights which were considered unattractive compared to the rest of the E46 lineup.

=== Transmissions ===

Transmission options are mostly the same as the equivalent E46 coupe/sedan model.

From early 2003, the 325ti was available with a 6-speed SMG-II automated manual transmission.

=== Models ===
==== Petrol engines ====

* Used instead of the N42 engine in countries where vehicles tax charges favour smaller engines.
† Used instead of the N46 engine in countries where vehicles tax charges favour smaller engines.

==== Diesel engines ====

<text>12 O&#x27;Clock High is an American military drama television series set in World War II. It was originally broadcast on ABC-TV for two-and-one-half TV seasons from September 1964 through January 1967 and was based on the 1949 film of the same name. The series was a co-production of 20th Century Fox Television (Fox had also produced the movie) and QM Productions (one of their few non-law-enforcement series). This show is one of the two QM shows not to display a copyright notice at the beginning, but rather at the end (the other was &quot;A Man Called Sloane&quot;) and the only one not to display the standard &quot;A QM Production&quot; closing card on the closing credits.

== Overview ==
The series follows the missions of the fictitious 918th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), equipped with B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, stationed at Archbury Field, England (a fictitious air base). For the first season, many of the characters from the book and 1949 movie were retained, including Brigadier General Frank Savage, Major Harvey Stovall, Major Cobb, Doc Kaiser, and General Pritchard, albeit played by different actors from in the motion picture. In addition to these characters, several other infrequently reappearing characters were introduced, including Captain (later Colonel) Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Gallagher, who appeared in two episodes (episodes 1 and 24) as well as being the central character for seasons two and three.

At the end of the first season, the studio executives decided a younger-looking lead actor was needed. In the first episode of the second season, General Savage, played by Robert Lansing, was killed in action and replaced by Colonel Joe Gallagher, played by Paul Burke. (Burke, though considered more youthful-looking than Lansing, was actually two years older, which TV critics were quick to point out.) The decision to replace Lansing with Burke proved unpopular and the ratings began to drop quickly.

The character Joe Gallagher&#x27;s father was Lt. General Maxwell Gallagher, played by Barry Sullivan. Burke and Sullivan had previously worked together in the TV series &quot;Harbormaster&quot;. In an interview given by Lansing on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in 1965, Lansing mentioned that had he known what a boost to his career &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; was, he never would have fired himself. Savage was killed off in a way so as not to require Lansing&#x27;s participation. According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, ABC moved the show from a 10:00 pm Friday time slot to a 7:30 pm Monday time slot for the second season to capture a younger audience. It was hoped that TV viewers would identify more with a colonel rather than an Army Air Corps general. Lansing, had he remained, would have received limited air time with Burke&#x27;s addition.

For the second season, most of the supporting cast from the first season was replaced, with the exception of Major Stovall, Doc Kaiser, and an occasional appearance by General Pritchard. Other actors who did reappear after the first season played other characters. Edward Mulhare appeared twice – as different Luftwaffe officers. Bruce Dern appeared four times as three different characters. Tom Skerritt appeared five times, each time in a different role.

The first two seasons were filmed in black-and-white, as ABC did not mandate prime time shows to be in color until the 1966-1967 season, but it also allowed the inclusion of actual World War II combat footage supplied by the U.S. Air Force and the library of 20th Century Fox movies. The inclusion of combat footage was often obvious, as it was often quite degraded. Limited usable combat footage often resulted in the same shot being reused in multiple episodes. For the third season, the TV series was filmed in color, but this season only ran for 17 episodes, with the series being canceled in midseason. Some of the combat footage used for the third season seemed to be in black-and-white footage tinted blue. Film footage from the 1940s was also used for take-offs and landings since the one B-17 to which the show had access could only taxi. To simulate different aircraft, it was frequently repainted.

In later episodes, Gallagher flew as &quot;mission control&quot; in a North American P-51 Mustang. This plot scheme was added to cut production costs. The single-engine Mustang costs less to fly than the four-engined B-17, and requires only a single pilot rather than two pilots and several crewmen. A wartime precedent for this existed, however: Maj.-Gen. Earle E. Partridge, the G-3 (operations) commander of the 8th Air Force, used a P-51 modified for photo-reconnaissance work to take photographs of his bomber group formations for training and critiquing purposes.

&quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; was created in an episodic format, with no particular order for the episodes. A trio of episodes produced about a shuttle air raid to North Africa was in fact never aired in story order (episode 44 &quot;We&#x27;re Not Coming Back&quot;, episode 37 &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and episode 38 &quot;The Hotshot&quot;). The stories were often based more on character drama than action, usually involving individuals who felt the need to redeem themselves in the eyes of others. Other story lines focused on actual war events, such as the development of bombing through cloud cover using radar, and the complexities of operating a large fleet of (often malfunctioning) B-17s.

Much of the filming was carried out on the Chino Airport, just east of Los Angeles County, California, in San Bernardino County. Chino had been a USAAF training field for World War II, and its combination of long, heavy-duty runways and (at the time) wide-open farmland for miles in all directions was rapidly turning the field into a haven for World War II aviation enthusiasts and their restored aircraft. Former Army Air Forces P-51 Mustangs, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, B-26 Invaders, and former U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps F4U Corsairs and F6F Hellcats could be found, along with a vintage B-17 and the P-51 Mustang used in &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;.

The B-17 belonged to Ed Maloney&#x27;s Air Museum, B-17E, F, and G models of the Flying Fortress (the latter with the chin turret) were used interchangeably. The inclusion of actual combat and crash footage often resulted in the tail designations of the bombers changing between film shots.

The segments in 1966 had the former Royal Canadian Air Force pilot Lynn Garrison coordinating the aerial footage. Garrison had been drawn to the project by his friend Robert Lansing. Garrison owned the P-51 used in the series.

As of February 2020, the Heroes &amp; Icons channel broadcasts the series as part of its Saturday-night lineup.

<text>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It is a non-intrusive method of surveying the sub-surface to investigate underground utilities such as concrete, asphalt, metals, pipes, cables or masonry. This nondestructive method uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band (UHF/VHF frequencies) of the radio spectrum, and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures. GPR can have applications in a variety of media, including rock, soil, ice, fresh water, pavements and structures. In the right conditions, practitioners can use GPR to detect subsurface objects, changes in material properties, and voids and cracks.

GPR uses high-frequency (usually polarized) radio waves, usually in the range 10 MHz to 2.6 GHz. A GPR transmitter and antenna emits electromagnetic energy into the ground. When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials having different permittivities, it may be reflected or refracted or scattered back to the surface. A receiving antenna can then record the variations in the return signal. The principles involved are similar to seismology, except GPR methods implement electromagnetic energy rather than acoustic energy, and energy may be reflected at boundaries where subsurface electrical properties change rather than subsurface mechanical properties as is the case with seismic energy.

The electrical conductivity of the ground, the transmitted center frequency, and the radiated power all may limit the effective depth range of GPR investigation. Increases in electrical conductivity attenuate the introduced electromagnetic wave, and thus the penetration depth decreases. Because of frequency-dependent attenuation mechanisms, higher frequencies do not penetrate as far as lower frequencies. However, higher frequencies may provide improved resolution. Thus operating frequency is always a trade-off between resolution and penetration. Optimal depth of subsurface penetration is achieved in ice where the depth of penetration can achieve several thousand metres (to bedrock in Greenland) at low GPR frequencies. Dry sandy soils or massive dry materials such as granite, limestone, and concrete tend to be resistive rather than conductive, and the depth of penetration could be up to . However, in moist or clay-laden soils and materials with high electrical conductivity, penetration may be as little as a few centimetres.

Ground-penetrating radar antennas are generally in contact with the ground for the strongest signal strength; however, GPR air-launched antennas can be used above the ground.

Cross borehole GPR has developed within the field of hydrogeophysics to be a valuable means of assessing the presence and amount of soil water.

== History ==
The first patent for a system designed to use continuous-wave radar to locate buried objects was submitted by Gotthelf Leimbach and Heinrich Löwy in 1910, six years after the first patent for radar itself (patent DE 237 944). A patent for a system using radar pulses rather than a continuous wave was filed in 1926 by Dr. Hülsenbeck (DE 489 434), leading to improved depth resolution. A glacier&#x27;s depth was measured using ground penetrating radar in 1929 by W. Stern.

Further developments in the field remained sparse until the 1970s, when military applications began driving research. Commercial applications followed and the first affordable consumer equipment was sold in 1975.

In 1972, the Apollo 17 mission carried a ground penetrating radar called ALSE (Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment) in orbit around the Moon. It was able to record depth information up to 1.3 km and recorded the results on film due to the lack of suitable computer storage at the time.

==Applications==
GPR has many applications in a number of fields. In the Earth sciences it is used to study bedrock, soils, groundwater, and ice. It is of some utility in prospecting for gold nuggets and for diamonds in alluvial gravel beds, by finding natural traps in buried stream beds that have the potential for accumulating heavier particles. The Chinese lunar rover Yutu has a GPR on its underside to investigate the soil and crust of the Moon.

Engineering applications include nondestructive testing (NDT) of structures and pavements, locating buried structures and utility lines, and studying soils and bedrock. In environmental remediation, GPR is used to define landfills, contaminant plumes, and other remediation sites, while in archaeology it is used for mapping archaeological features and cemeteries. GPR is used in law enforcement for locating clandestine graves and buried evidence. Military uses include detection of mines, unexploded ordnance, and tunnels.

Borehole radars utilizing GPR are used to map the structures from a borehole in underground mining applications. Modern directional borehole radar systems are able to produce three-dimensional images from measurements in a single borehole.

One of the other main applications for ground-penetrating radars is for locating underground utilities. Standard electromagnetic induction utility locating tools require utilities to be conductive. These tools are ineffective for locating plastic conduits or concrete storm and sanitary sewers. Since GPR detects variations in dielectric properties in the subsurface, it can be highly effective for locating non-conductive utilities.

GPR was often used on the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; which used the technology to determine a suitable area for examination by means of excavations. GPR was also used to recover £150,000 in cash ransom that Michael Sams had buried in a field, following his 1992 kidnapping of an estate agent.

=== Military ===
Military applications of ground-penetrating radar include detection of unexploded ordnance and detecting tunnels. In military applications and other common GPR applications, practitioners often use GPR in conjunction with other available geophysical techniques such as electrical resistivity and electromagnetic induction methods.

In May 2020, the U.S. military ordered ground-penetrating radar system from Chemring Sensors and Electronics Systems (CSES), to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs) buried in roadways, in $200.2 million deal.

=== Vehicle localization ===
A recent novel approach to vehicle localization using prior map based images from ground penetrating radar has been demonstrated. Termed &quot;Localizing Ground Penetrating Radar&quot; (LGPR), centimeter level accuracies at speeds up to 100 km/h (60 mph) have been demonstrated. Closed-loop operation was first demonstrated in 2012 for autonomous vehicle steering and fielded for military operation in 2013. Highway speed centimeter-level localization during a night-time snow-storm was demonstrated in 2016. This technology was exclusively licensed and commercialized for vehicle safety in ADAS and Autonomous Vehicle positioning and lane-keeping systems by GPR Inc. and marketed as Ground Positioning Radar(tm).

===Archaeology===
Ground penetrating radar survey is one method used in archaeological geophysics. GPR can be used to detect and map subsurface archaeological artifacts, features, and patterning.

The concept of radar is familiar to most people. With ground penetrating radar, the radar signal – an electromagnetic pulse – is directed into the ground. Subsurface objects and stratigraphy (layering) will cause reflections that are picked up by a receiver. The travel time of the reflected signal indicates the depth. Data may be plotted as profiles, as planview maps isolating specific depths, or as three-dimensional models.

GPR can be a powerful tool in favorable conditions (uniform sandy soils are ideal). Like other geophysical methods used in archaeology (and unlike excavation) it can locate artifacts and map features without any risk of damaging them. Among methods used in archaeological geophysics, it is unique both in its ability to detect some small objects at relatively great depths, and in its ability to distinguish the depth of anomaly sources.

The principal disadvantage of GPR is that it is severely limited by less-than-ideal environmental conditions. Fine-grained sediments (clays and silts) are often problematic because their high electrical conductivity causes loss of signal strength; rocky or heterogeneous sediments scatter the GPR signal, weakening the useful signal while increasing extraneous noise.

In the field of cultural heritage GPR with high frequency antenna is also used for investigating historical masonry structures, detecting cracks and decay patterns of columns and detachment of frescoes.

===Burial sites===
GPR is used by criminologists, historians, and archaeologists to search burial sites. In his publication, &quot;Interpreting Ground-penetrating Radar for Archaeology&quot;, Lawrence Conyers, one of the first archaeological specialists in GPR, described the process. Conyers published research using GPR in El Salvador in 1996, in the Four Corners region Chaco period in southern Arizona in 1997, and in a medieval site in Ireland in 2018. Informed by Conyer&#x27;s research, the Institute of Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology at the University of Alberta, in collaboration with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, have been using GPR in their survey of Indian Residential Schools in Canada. By June 2021, the Institute had used GPR to locate suspected unmarked graves in areas near historic cemeteries and Indian Residential Schools. On May 27, 2021, it was reported that 215 unmarked anomalies (possibly children&#x27;s graves) were found using GPR at a burial site at the Kamloops Indian Residential School on Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation land in British Columbia. In June 2021, GPR technology was used by the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan to locate 751 unmarked gravesites on the Marieval Indian Residential School site, which had been in operation for a century until it was closed down in 1996. 

Advancements in GPR technology integrated with various 3D software modelling platforms generate three-dimensional reconstructions of subsurface &quot;shapes and their spatial relationships&quot;. By 2021, this has been &quot;emerging as the new standard&quot;.

===Glaciology===
==Three-dimensional imaging==
Individual lines of GPR data represent a sectional (profile) view of the subsurface. Multiple lines of data systematically collected over an area may be used to construct three-dimensional or tomographic images. Data may be presented as three-dimensional blocks, or as horizontal or vertical slices. Horizontal slices (known as &quot;depth slices&quot; or &quot;time slices&quot;) are essentially planview maps isolating specific depths. Time-slicing has become standard practice in archaeological applications, because horizontal patterning is often the most important indicator of cultural activities.

==Limitations==
The most significant performance limitation of GPR is in high-conductivity materials such as clay soils and soils that are salt contaminated. Performance is also limited by signal scattering in heterogeneous conditions (e.g. rocky soils).

Other disadvantages of currently available GPR systems include:
*Interpretation of radar-grams is generally non-intuitive to the novice.
*Considerable expertise is necessary to effectively design, conduct, and interpret GPR surveys.
*Relatively high energy consumption can be problematic for extensive field surveys.

Radar is sensitive to changes in material composition; detecting changes requires movement. When looking through stationary items using surface-penetrating or ground-penetrating radar, the equipment needs to be moved in order for the radar to examine the specified area by looking for differences in material composition. While it can identify items such as pipes, voids, and soil, it cannot identify the specific materials, such as gold and precious gems. It can, however, be useful in providing subsurface mapping of potential gem-bearing pockets, or &quot;vugs&quot;. The readings can be confused by moisture in the ground and they can&#x27;t separate gem-bearing pockets from non-gem-bearing ones.
When determining depth capabilities, the frequency range of the antenna dictates the size of the antenna and the depth capability. The grid spacing which is scanned is based on the size of the targets that need to be identified and the results required. Typical grid spacings can be 1 meter, 3 ft, 5 ft, 10 ft, 20 ft for ground surveys, and for walls and floors 1 inch–1 ft.

The speed at which a radar signal travels is dependent upon the composition of the material being penetrated. The depth to a target is determined based on the amount of time it takes for the radar signal to reflect back to the unit’s antenna. Radar signals travel at different velocities through different types of materials. It is possible to use the depth to a known object to determine a specific velocity and then calibrate the depth calculations.

==Power regulation==
In 2005, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute introduced legislation to regulate GPR equipment and GPR operators to control excess emissions of electromagnetic radiation. The European GPR association (EuroGPR) was formed as a trade association to represent and protect the legitimate use of GPR in Europe.

==Similar technologies==

===Enhanced ground imaging and bomb detection===
Ground-penetrating radar uses a variety of technologies to generate the radar signal: these are impulse, stepped frequency, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW), and noise. Systems on the market in 2009 also use Digital signal processing (DSP) to process the data during survey work rather than off-line.

A special kind of GPR uses unmodulated continuous-wave signals. This holographic subsurface radar differs from other GPR types in that it records plan-view subsurface holograms. Depth penetration of this kind of radar is rather small (20–30 cm), but lateral resolution is enough to discriminate different types of landmines in the soil, or cavities, defects, bugging devices, or other hidden objects in walls, floors, and structural elements.

GPR is used on vehicles for high-speed road survey and landmine detection. EU Detect Force Technology, an advanced soil research company, design utilizes X6 Plus Grounding Radar (XGR) as an hybrid GPR application for military mine detection and also police bomb detection. The &quot;Mineseeker Project&quot; seeks to design a system to determine whether landmines are present in areas using ultra wideband synthetic aperture radar units mounted on blimps.

===Utility lines===
In Pipe-Penetrating Radar (IPPR) and In Sewer GPR (ISGPR) are applications of GPR technologies applied in non-metallic-pipes where the signals are directed through pipe and conduit walls to detect pipe wall thickness and voids behind the pipe walls.

SewerVUE Technology, an advanced pipe condition assessment company utilizes Pipe Penetrating Radar (PPR) as an in pipe GPR application to see remaining wall thickness, rebar cover, delamination, and detect the presence of voids developing outside the pipe.

===Wall-penetrating radar===
Wall-penetrating radar can read through non-metallic structures as demonstrated for the first time by ASIO and Australian Police in 1984 while surveying an ex Russian Embassy in Canberra. Police showed how to watch people up to two rooms away laterally and through floors vertically, could see metal lumps that might be weapons; GPR can even act as a motion sensor for military guards and police.

<text>Patricia Helen Kennedy Lawford (May 6, 1924 – September 17, 2006) was an American socialite, and the sixth of nine children of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. She was a sister of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Senator Ted Kennedy, as well as the sister-in-law of Jacqueline Kennedy. Patricia wanted to be a film producer, a profession not readily open to young women in her time. She married English actor Peter Lawford in 1954, but they divorced in 1966.

==Early life==
Patricia Helen Kennedy was born on May 6 1924 in Brookline, Massachusetts. She attended Roehampton Sacred Heart Convent School (now Woldingham School) in London, and Maplehurst Sacred Heart Convent School in Bronxville, New York. In 1945, she received a bachelor of arts degree from Rosemont College, where she was active in both directing and acting in theatrical productions.

She was considered the most sophisticated, yet also the most introverted, of her parents&#x27; five daughters. Since childhood she had a fascination with travel and Hollywood. In time, she would become a world traveler, so much so that, as a young girl, she was given assignments by the independent and foreign press to write of her travels. Her ongoing fascination with Hollywood was fueled by her father&#x27;s stories and adventures there as a movie mogul heading RKO Pictures. After graduating from Rosemont College, she decided to pursue her interest in theatrical activities.

==Career==
Her father apparently believed that she could do as much, once saying, &quot;Pat is the one with head for business. She could really run this town if she put her mind to it.&quot;

She began working as an assistant in NBC&#x27;s New York production department. She then moved to Hollywood to work as an assistant for singer Kate Smith&#x27;s radio program, and later for Father Peyton&#x27;s &quot;Family Rosary Crusade&quot;. When she was 22 years old, Patricia was the producer of &quot;I Love to Eat&quot;, on NBC-TV; it was the first cooking program on network television.

In her youth, Patricia befriended RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Edith Rosenbaum, and made Rosenbaum godmother to her children.

===Political involvement===
In addition to her work in show business, Patricia was a tireless supporter of her brothers&#x27; political campaigns. For John&#x27;s congressional race in 1946, she and her sisters and mother held a number of &quot;tea parties&quot; around Boston in which they discussed John&#x27;s boyhood and his World War II experience. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Patricia traveled around the country speaking on her brother’s behalf, and she would later play an active role in the presidential races of her brothers Robert and Edward.

==Personal life==
She met English actor Peter Lawford through her brother John in 1949. They courted briefly, and officially announced their engagement in February 1954. They married on April 24, 1954, at St. Thomas More Church in New York City, 12 days before her 30th birthday. They settled in Santa Monica, California, and had four children: Christopher Lawford (1955–2018), Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961). Patricia and Peter (who was a member of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Rat Pack&quot;) held lavish parties at their Malibu mansion during the 1950s and early 1960s with guests such as Marilyn Monroe.

Despite the glamorous persona Lawford presented, their relationship suffered strains as early as their brief engagement. Lawford had difficulty adjusting to Kennedy&#x27;s steadfast Catholicism and her family&#x27;s larger-than-life image. Kennedy could not tolerate Lawford&#x27;s heavy drinking, extramarital affairs, and gradual addiction to drugs. Shortly after her brother Jack&#x27;s death in 1963, she filed for a legal separation, and the couple officially divorced in February 1966. She never remarried.

==Later years==
After her divorce, Kennedy battled alcoholism, and suffered from tongue cancer. She worked with the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, as well as with the National Center on Addiction, and was a founder of the National Committee for the Literary Arts, for which she arranged a series of author lectures and scholarships.

==Death==
Kennedy died of pneumonia aged 82 on September 17, 2006, in her Manhattan home. She was buried in Southampton Cemetery.

<doc id="1181000" wikidata="Q7754755" url="?curid=1181000" title="The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards">
<text>The Official &quot;Star Wars&quot; Fan Film Awards was an annual contest put forth by Lucasfilm and AtomFilms to showcase and acknowledge the growing genre of fan films made by, for, and about fans of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga. The inaugural contest in 2002 was the first time Lucasfilm had officially sanctioned the genre. In 2007, the contest was renamed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Fan Movie Challenge. In 2012, Lucasfilm announced that the contest was being discontinued, and that the company was looking for &quot;new ways for fans to share their creativity&quot;.

Lucasfilm later announced, via the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; website, that the Fan Film Awards would return in 2014, for the first time in three years, welcoming different genres and styles. The best short films of that year were screened at &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration 2015 in Anaheim, California. The awards were last held in 2018.

== Awards ==
=== Rules ===
A number of guidelines ensure that entries are produced by amateurs and do not infringe on Lucasfilm properties. The contest limits the content of entries to short film and video parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and fan experience. Until 2007, In-universe fan fiction-type stories were not allowed. Rules changed in 2007 after all &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies have been released and fan fiction is now allowed. The contest imposes a time limit on entries - for the inaugural contest, it was 30 minutes, but this was lowered to 15 for the 2003-2005 contests. For 2006 and 2007, the time limit was lowered again to 10 minutes. Entries must not contain nudity, excessive swearing, explicit sexual themes or graphic violence. In addition, no unlicensed copyrighted material may be used in the entries, with the exception of a collection of approved images, music and sound effects . For 2006 onward, the contest rules were revised to prohibit contributions that are subject to or under the &quot;jurisdiction of any guild or union collective bargaining agreement.&quot; (This does not, however, prevent a contestant from submitting an entry if they happen to belong to a union. For example, an amateur film-maker who is also a truck driver that is a member of the Teamsters.)

=== Presentation ===
The awards have been presented at ceremonies held at either Comic-Con International or Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration conventions. For the first contest in 2002, Kevin Smith hosted a special on the SciFi Channel to showcase the winners and some finalists. Winning films have been shown online at starwars.com, atom.com, and some have appeared on SpikeTV. In October 2008, a selection of winning films was shown in a special &quot;Star Wars&quot; Fan Movie Challenge-themed episode of &quot;Atom TV&quot; on Comedy Central.

=== Categories ===
The contest&#x27;s grand prize is the George Lucas Selects Award, which is presented to the film Lucas himself selects as his favorite. The Audience Choice Award is selected by the worldwide internet audience, as all contest finalists are available to view online at Atom.com. The Pioneer Award is given to a film that either defined, changed, or influenced the genre. Other awards are given by a jury of people selected from employees of Atom.com and Lucasfilm. Beginning in 2004, some of the major awards were sponsored by Lucasfilm licensees.
