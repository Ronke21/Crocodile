<text>The International Progress Organization (IPO) is a Vienna-based think tank dealing with world affairs. As an international non-governmental organization (NGO) it enjoys consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and is associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information. The organization aims at promoting peaceful co-existence among all nations, in particular the dialogue among civilizations; a just international economic order; global respect for human rights; and the international rule of law. The IPO has members in more than 70 countries on all continents and organizes conferences and expert meetings on issues of conflict resolution, civilizational dialogue, international law, and United Nations reform. The organization publishes the series &quot;Studies in International Relations&quot; (since 1978) and monographs in the field of international relations theory.

The president of the IPO is Dr. Hans Köchler, the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. The organization was founded in Innsbruck (Austria) in 1972 by a group of students from Austria, Egypt and India who felt a need for a new approach towards North-South relations and development partnership. Among the original supporters of the organization were the then Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschläger, Senegalese President Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Indian President Gyani Zail Singh.

==Activities==

Since 1974 the IPO has organized a series of lectures and conferences on the cultural dimension of international affairs (Amman 1974; Innsbruck 1974; Vienna 1979; Rome 1981; Nicosia 1984); these activities preceded the current global discourse on the dialogue of civilizations in which the I.P.O. has participated through the organization of expert meetings in Europe and the Muslim world. In 1987 the IPO initiated (in co-operation with Nobel Laureate Seán MacBride) the Lawyers&#x27; Appeal Against Nuclear War which led to a worldwide civil society campaign for a resolution by the UN General Assembly calling for an Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the question of the legality of nuclear arms. In September 1991 the IPO convened the &quot;Second International Conference On A More Democratic United Nations&quot; (CAMDUN-2) at the United Nations Office at Vienna. In 2000 the Secretary-General of the United Nations nominated two officials of the organization as international observers at the Lockerbie trial in the Netherlands (see also: Pan Am Flight 103 and Hans Köchler&#x27;s Lockerbie trial observer mission). Since 1985, the IPO has been calling for a democratization of the United Nations Organization, in particular of the UN Security Council. Since 1987, the organization has been dealing with the problem of international terrorism, repeatedly suggesting a legal definition of terrorism by the UN General Assembly. The various initiatives and proposals are documented in the IPO conference proceedings. In addition to the organization of lectures and international conferences, the IPO has undertaken (since 1980) monitoring missions in the fields of human rights and the rule of law.

<text>.mo is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Macau. 

== Management ==
The registry for this domain name is operated by the Macao Network Information Centre (MONIC). Operated by the University of Macau since 1992, MONIC administers the registration of the country-code domain names ccTLD.

To further promote the development of services, the Government of Macau changed the operation entity of MONIC. Effective from 12 March 2011, HNET Asia Limited appointed by the Macau government, is responsible for operating MONIC.

HNET aims at optimising and developing the Macau domain name. 

It will contribute to the development of the internet industry in Macau, as well as deploying Chinese domain names (including at the top-level domain name ), DNSSEC and other capabilities for the registry.

== Registration ==
At present, domain names are open to local businesses and organisations and cannot be registered by the general public.

=== Second-level ===
*.mo, - commercial entities in Macau

=== Third-level ===
== Internationalised top level domain ==
In early 2015 two new top level domains were reserved for Macau. They are (in simplified Chinese) and (in traditional Chinese). MONIC has requested these domains.

Jaycee Chan Joming (, born December 3, 1982) is an American-born Chinese actor and singer. In 2004, he released his first Mandarin CD album in Hong Kong. He is the son of Hong Kong-born Chinese actor and martial artist Jackie Chan and Taiwanese actress Joan Lin. He sings and performs in Mandarin and Cantonese.

In 2014, Chan was arrested and jailed for the possession and distribution of marijuana, and for accommodating drug users at his apartment in Beijing. Chan was sentenced to six months in state prison, and served out his full sentence behind bars.

Chan&#x27;s career and reputation were damaged by the drug scandal. In 2021, he started his own Tequila brand Los 7 Ángeles.

==Early life and education==
Chan was born on December 3, 1982, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Taiwanese actress Joan Lin and Hong Kong-born Chinese martial arts star Jackie Chan.

Chan briefly attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, for two semesters, but did not graduate. He has a penchant for luxury cars and nightlife and stated that he left school because &quot;all you can see in Virginia is sheep.&quot;

Chan speaks English, Mandarin and Cantonese.

==Career==
Giving up on school, Chan moved to Hong Kong in 2003 to pursue his career. He composed the music and wrote the lyrics for 10 of the 13 tracks on his first CD, &quot;Jaycee&quot; (2004). His film debut was &quot;The Twins Effect II&quot;, in which his father had a cameo role. His second role was a Hong Kong romance film &quot;2 Young,&quot; in which he co-starred with Hong Kong Cantopop singer Fiona Sit. They both worked together again on &quot;Break Up Club&quot; in 2010. In 2007, he co-starred alongside Nicholas Tse and Shawn Yue in Benny Chan&#x27;s action film &quot;Invisible Target&quot;.

Despite heavy promotions and awards, his albums and movies have not been commercially successful. His film &quot;Double Trouble&quot; only grossed in Hong Kong in the first two weeks.

In early 2009, Chinese websites reported he had given up his United States citizenship in favor of Chinese citizenship to appeal to local audiences. He later confirmed this on Instagram.

He voiced the younger version of his father&#x27;s character Master Monkey in &quot;Secrets of the Furious Five&quot;. In addition, he voiced Master Crane in the Cantonese version of &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; and its sequel &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot;.

Chan and his father starred together in Jackie&#x27;s 100th film, &quot;1911&quot;. The team-up resulted in Jackie Chan&#x27;s least profitable and worst reviewed film to date.

In 2015, his father revealed that Chan had shown interest on writing a script for a sequel to &quot;CZ12&quot; and will make the film &quot;if it&#x27;s right&quot;.

==Arrest==
On August 18, 2014, it was reported that Chan had been arrested on August 14, by Beijing police due to drug possession, alongside Kai Ko, a Taiwanese actor. Public informants known as Chaoyang masses were credited for turning Chan in. Police later found more than of marijuana after searching Chan&#x27;s apartment. While Ko was set to be released 14 days after his arrest, Chan faced criminal charges and sentences up to the death penalty or life imprisonment for allegedly hosting others to consume marijuana. 

Chan, whose father Jackie had been China&#x27;s anti-drug goodwill ambassador since 2009, admitted to taking drugs for 8 years. Soon after, Jackie Chan made a public apology for his son&#x27;s drug use. On September 17, 2014, Beijing Dongcheng procurator&#x27;s office approved the formal arrest of Chan on suspicion of &quot;accommodating drug users&quot;.

Chan spent his 32nd birthday in custody with his mother stating that her son has borrowed more than a hundred books to read since he was detained. On December 22, 2014, four months after his arrest, Chan was indicted by Chinese authorities for sheltering other people to use drugs. His trial finally began on January 9, 2015, in Beijing, after spending 148 days in detention. Chan was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 2,000 yuan (~US$320). Chan confessed that he broke the law and he should be punished for his actions and that he would not do it again. His parents did not attend their son&#x27;s hearing, although the elder Chan was reportedly in Beijing. His father repeatedly said that he would not use his connections to lighten his son&#x27;s sentence.

It was later revealed that during his detention, Chan wrote a three-page remorse letter to his mother in which he promised that he would not repeat his mistakes in the future.

Chan was released from jail on February 13. One day after his release, Chan held a press conference in Beijing to make a public apology by saying that he had no reason and no excuse for his law breaking and his arrest had a negative impact on society and that it disappointed his supporters while causing losses for those who worked with him. In his four-minute speech, he promised that he would be a law-abiding citizen, and while he still had plans to continue in the entertainment industry, he would focus on spending Chinese New Year with his parents. He stated that prison life was harsh and that his father did not use any connections to help ease his sentence. He extended a deep bow both before and after his speech.

Before his arrest in August 2014, Chan was filming &quot;Monk Comes Down the Mountain.&quot; His role in the film was not credited due to his arrest.

== Reception and public image ==
Chan is largely viewed as a spendthrift and &quot;playboy&quot; whose movies and music have not been met with commercial or critical success despite heavy promotion and support. In 2014, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; ranked Chan as one of China&#x27;s top &quot;wastrel&quot; &quot;fuerdai&quot;. Chan&#x27;s arrest in 2014 severely affected his career, and he lost multi-million dollar endorsements and contracts from Adidas, Nivea, Yishion, Johnson &amp; Johnson contact lenses, Stride gum, KFC, and Chevrolet.

==Personal life==
After Chan&#x27;s release from prison, he lived with his mother in Taipei, keeping a low profile, and often wearing a mask to avoid being recognised in public.

He claimed he had flown before COVID-19 had spread to the United States. When the situation worsened in the US, he decided to stay in LA as he felt that there would be a higher probability of him being infected if he were to make the long journey home.

=== Relationship with Jackie Chan ===
During an awards ceremony in Beijing in April 2011, Jackie stated that he would be donating half his money to charity when he dies, instead of to his son. Jackie explained, &quot;If he is capable, he can make his own money. If he is not, then he will just be wasting my money.&quot;

After serving six months in jail, Chan met his father for the first time in Taiwan, and the two appeared to have reconciled. &quot;I hadn&#x27;t seen him for too long. I feel he&#x27;s matured this time,&quot; Jackie Chan said. &quot;We didn&#x27;t talk about unhappy things. It was all family chat. We talked into the night and didn&#x27;t sleep.&quot; Before leaving to do a promotion, he gave his son a haircut.

<doc id="1168044" wikidata="Q926150" url="?curid=1168044" title="Dhritarashtra">
<text>Dhritarashtra () was a ruler of the ancient Kuru kingdom, featured as a central character in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is also attested in the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, where he is acknowledged as the son of King Vichitravirya.

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Dhritarashtra’s birth was the result of the ancient practice of &quot;Niyoga&quot;. After Vichitravirya died childless, his half-brother Vyasa fathered children with Vichitravirya’s widows to continue the Kuru lineage. Dhritarashtra was born blind to Vichitravirya’s elder queen, Ambika. Despite being the eldest, his blindness disqualified him from inheriting the throne, which passed to his younger half-brother, Pandu. However, after Pandu renounced the throne and retired to the forest, Dhritarashtra assumed kingship of the Kuru kingdom, albeit as a nominal ruler heavily influenced by his grandsire, Bhishma, and his eldest son, Duryodhana.

Dhritarashtra married Gandhari, a devoted wife who, in a gesture of solidarity, blindfolded herself for life to share in her husband&#x27;s blindness. Together, they had one hundred sons, known as the Kauravas, and a daughter, Dushala. Throughout his reign, Dhritarashtra struggled with the conflicting roles of father and king. His deep affection for Duryodhana, often clouded his judgment, leading him to overlook his son&#x27;s misdeeds and fail to curb the injustices inflicted upon their cousins, the Pandavas. His hundred sons, led by Duryodhana, became the antagonists in the Mahabharata, opposing the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. Dhritarashtra also fathered a son, Yuyutsu, through a maid, who later sided with the Pandavas during the war.

During the Kurukshetra War, Dhritarashtra depended on his charioteer Sanjaya, who had divine vision, to learn about the entire details of the war, the deaths of the prominent warriors, and the profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. After the war, which resulted in the fall of the Kauravas, a grief-stricken Dhritarashtra withdrew to the forest with Gandhari, Kunti, and Vidura. He spent his final years in asceticism and meditation, ultimately passing away in a forest fire, attaining liberation.

== Etymology and historicity ==
&quot;Dhṛtarāṣṭra&quot; means &quot;He who supports/bears the nation&quot;.

A historical Kuru King named Dhr̥tarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya is mentioned in the &quot;Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā&quot; of the Yajurveda ( 1200–900 BCE) as a descendant of the Rigvedic-era King Sudas of the Bharatas. His cattle was reportedly destroyed as a result of the conflict with the &quot;vrātya&quot; ascetics; however, this Vedic mention does not provide corroboration for the accuracy of the Mahabharata&#x27;s account of his reign. Dhritarashtra did not accept the vratyas into his territory, and with the aid of rituals, the vratyas destroyed his cattle. The group of vratyas were led by Vaka Dālbhi of Panchala.

== Birth and early life ==
With Vichitravirya having died of sickness, Bhishma unable to take the throne because of his vow, and Bahlika&#x27;s line unwilling to leave the Bahlika Kingdom, there was a succession crisis in Hastinapura. Satyavati invites her son Vyasa to impregnate the queens Ambika and Ambalika under the Niyoga practice. When Vyasa went to impregnate Ambika, his appearance was scary and frightened her, so she closed her eyes during their union; hence her son was born blind.

Dhritarashtra, along with his younger half-brother Pandu, was trained in the military arts by Bhishma and Kripacharya. Hindered by his handicap, Dhritarashtra was unable to wield weapons, but had the strength of one hundred thousand elephants due to a boon given by Vyasa, and was said to be so strong that he could crush iron with his bare hands.
When it came time to nominate an heir, Vidura suggested that Pandu would be a better fit because he was not blind. Though bitter about losing his birthright, Dhritarashtra willingly conceded the crown, though this act would seep into the obsession he would have over his crown later in life. Dhritarashtra married Gandhari of Hastinapura&#x27;s weakened and lowly vassal Gandhara; After their marriage, Gandhari covered her eyes with a blindfold in order to truly experience her husband&#x27;s blindness. Gandhari and he had one hundred sons, called the Kauravas, and one daughter Dushala. He also had a son named Yuyutsu mothered by a maid.

== Reign ==
After the incident with Rishi Kindama, Pandu retired to the forest. Hence, Dhritarashtra was offered the crown. Through the blessings of Vyasa, he and Gandhari had one hundred sons and a daughter, with his eldest son, Duryodhana, becoming his heir. Upon Duryodhana&#x27;s birth, ill omens appeared; many sages and priests advised Dhritarashtra and Gandhari to abandon the baby. But they refused to do so; Duryodhana grew up with a princely education and his parents believed that he would be a great heir.

However, when Pandu died, Kunti and her sons returned to Hastinapura, living alongside Dhritarashtra&#x27;s children. Yudhishthira, Pandu&#x27;s eldest son, was older than Duryodhana. Given that Pandu was the king and that Yudhishthira was the son of the god of Dharma (Dharmaraja, also known as Yama) he had a strong claim to the throne. A succession crisis began; though recognising Yudhishthira&#x27;s merits, Dhritarashtra favoured his own son, blinded by affection. Upon much pressure from the Brahmins, Vidura, and Bhishma, Dhritarashtra reluctantly named Yudhishthira as his heir.

=== Bifurcation of the Kuru Kingdom ===
After the House of Lac incident, in which the Pandavas are believed to have been immolated, Dhritarashtra mourns, but was able to finally name Duryodhana as his heir. When the Pandavas are revealed to have survived, Duryodhana refuses to cede his title as heir when the sour relations between the Kauravas and the Pandavas simmer. On Bhishma&#x27;s advice, Dhritarashtra bifurcates the kingdom, giving Hastinapura to Duryodhana and Khandavaprastha to Yudhishthira.

=== The game of dice ===
Shakuni, Gandhari&#x27;s brother, was a master of dice as he could load them without his opponents having a clue. He, along with his nephew Duryodhana, conspired in a game of dice and invited the Pandavas to gamble. The Pandavas eventually lost their kingdom, wealth, and prestige and were exiled for thirteen years. Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, was humiliated in court after Dushasana tried to disrobe her. The blind king only intervened after counselling with Gandhari when Draupadi was going to curse the Kuru dynasty. Though notables like Vikarna and Vidura objected to the sins of Duryodhana, most of the spectators were helpless due to their obligations to Hastinapura; Dhritarashtra could have spoken out, but did not.

== The Kurukshetra War==

Krishna, as a peace emissary of the Pandavas, travelled to Hastinapura to persuade the Kauravas to avoid the bloodshed of their own kin. However, Duryodhana conspired to arrest him, which resulted in the failure of the mission. After Krishna&#x27;s peace mission failed and a war seemed inevitable, Vyasa approached Dhritarashtra and offered to grant him a divine vision so that Dhritarashtra could see the war. However, not willing to see his kin slaughtered, Dhritarashtra asked that the boon be given to Sanjaya, his charioteer. Sanjaya dutifully narrated the war to his liege, reporting how Bhima killed all his children. Sanjaya would console the blind king while challenging the king with his own viewpoints and morals. When Lord Krishna displayed his Vishvarupa (True form) to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Dhritarashtra regretted not possessing the divine sight.

Dhritarashtra was confident that Bhishma, Drona, Karna and the other invincible warriors would make the Kaurava camp victorious. He rejoiced whenever the tide of war turned against the Pandavas. However, the results of the war devastated him. All of his sons and grandsons but one were killed in the carnage. Dhritarashtra&#x27;s only daughter Duhsala was widowed. Yuyutsu had defected to Pandava side at the onset of the war, and was the only son of Dhritarashtra who had managed to survive the Kurukshetra War.

=== Crushing of Bhima&#x27;s metal statue ===

After the war ended, the victorious Pandavas arrived at Hastinapura for the formal transfer of power. The Pandavas set forth to embrace their uncle and offer him their respects. Dhritarashtra hugged Yudhishthira heartily without a grudge. When Dhritarashtra turned to Bhima, Krishna sensed his intentions and asked Bhima to step back and placed Bhima&#x27;s iron statue in his place. Dhritarashtra crushed the statue into pieces and then broke down crying, his rage leaving him. Broken and defeated, Dhritarashtra apologised for his folly and wholeheartedly embraced Bhima and the other Pandavas.

== Later years and death ==
15 years after the great war of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the grief-stricken blind king along with his wife Gandhari, sister-in-law Kunti, and half brother Vidura left Hastinapura for penance. It is believed that all of them (except Vidura who predeceased him) perished in a forest fire and attained moksha.

==Assessment==
Throughout his reign as King of Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra was torn between the principles of dharma and his love for his son Duryodhana. He often ended up endorsing his son&#x27;s actions merely out of fatherly love.

Dhritarashtra is physically strong, yet psychologically weak, easily manipulated by his brother-in-law, Shakuni. Dhritarashtra appears in &quot;Mahabharata&quot; sections that have been circulated as separate scriptures, most notably the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, whose dialogue was narrated to him.

<doc id="1168052" wikidata="Q3415277" url="?curid=1168052" title="Railway Operating Division">
<text>The Railway Operating Division (ROD) was a division of the Royal Engineers formed in 1915 to operate railways in the many theatres of the First World War. It was largely composed of railway employees and operated both standard gauge and narrow gauge railways.

The ROD operated their first line on a section of the Hazebrouck–Ypres line. The work was carried out by former employees of the London and North Western Railway.

The ROD requisitioned many diverse locomotives from Britain&#x27;s railway companies and leased several Belgian locomotives sent to France in 1914, but as the war dragged on adopted the Great Central Railway&#x27;s Robinson Class 8K 2-8-0 as its standard freight locomotive to become the ROD 2-8-0. Some locomotives were also purchased from Baldwin in the United States.

They also operated narrow-gauge engines (meter gauge or gauge trains).

After the war, requisitioned locomotives returned to their foreign owners.

* the ROD 2-8-0 were stored in Great Britain and sold to several British companies between 1919 and 1927.
* the Baldwin locomotives were sold as military surplus; most of them ended up in Belgium and France.
During the First World War, the Railway Operating Division were assisted in their duties by other army units. The 17th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers. The Battalion, a Pals Battalion raised by the North Eastern Railway, began its life as a regular infantry battalion. It later became a Pioneer battalion and, owing to the large number of railwaymen available, became a Railway Pioneer battalion in October 1916 working under General Headquarters (GHQ) Railway Construction Troops. In September 1917, the battalion returned to an infantry battalion but returned to GHQ in November. They finally returned to an infantry battalion in May 1918, where they remained until the end of the war.

== Railway Construction Companies ==
A number of Railway Construction Companies existed during the great war. The companies built standard gauge railways in combat zones on multiple fronts during the war. At the start of the First World War there were two regular and three special reserve, these were:

* 8th Railway Company
* 10th Railway Company
* Depot Company
* Royal Anglesey (1 company)
* Royal Monmouthshire (1 company)

It was soon realised the importance of railways on the front line, several more companies were raised for the duration of the war. The last company was demobilised in 1919.

Great War companies included:

<text>USS &quot;Marion&quot; was a sloop-of-war of the third rate in the Union Navy during the American Civil War launched at the Boston Navy Yard on 24 April 1839. On 10 November 1839, she departed Boston on her first cruise, to Brazil. Sunk when heaved down in the harbor at Rio de Janeiro early in 1842, she was raised and sailed back to Boston, arriving in May. She then set sail for the Caribbean, returning in May 1843. For the next few years, she remained in ordinary at Boston and then cruised off the West Coast of Africa and in the Mediterranean until 1848. She captured the &quot;Casket&quot;, a slaver, near Cabinda on 2 August 1846. After a tour in the East Indies from 1850 to 1852, she resumed operations with the African Squadron from 1853 to 1855 and 1858-60, capturing three more slaving ships: &quot;Brothers&quot; off Mayumba on 8 September 1858 and &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Ardennes&quot; in late April 1859 off the coast of Kongo. 1856-57 was spent in ordinary at Norfolk.

&quot;Marion&quot; was in ordinary service at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, when the Civil War broke out. She was recommissioned on 21 June 1861, and on 14 July sailed in search of the Confederate States of America cruiser CSS &quot;Jeff Davis&quot;. In September, she joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron, participating in the capture of Ship Island on the 16th. In March–April 1862, she was just off Apalachicola, Florida, in the West Pass when she was relieved by .

In May 1862, &quot;Marion&quot; was ordered to Boston for repairs. Back in service by 24 July, she sailed south to Annapolis, Maryland, where she was employed as a practice ship for midshipmen until 1870. In 1871, she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, decommissioned and was rebuilt as a third-rate screw steamer.

Recommissioned on 12 January 1876, she cruised on the European and South Atlantic Squadrons until December 1882, when she returned to Portsmouth. In 1885, she was ordered to the Pacific, where she was employed on the Asiatic Station until 1890. She then returned to the U.S., served briefly in the Bering Sea Squadron on duty connected with the seal fisheries, and, in late 1891, resumed operations with the Asiatic Squadron. Assigned to the Pacific Squadron in 1895, she cruised along the west coast of the Americas and amongst the Hawaiian Islands until 11 December 1897, when she decommissioned at Mare Island, California.

Subsequently, transferred to the custody of the State of California, she was employed as a training ship and headquarters for the California State Naval Militia. She was docked at San Francisco, California, pier No. 10 until 1907. On 14 March 1907, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and sold on 24 July to C. E. Boudrow, San Francisco.

The 11 inch Dahlgren from the Marion is now a Civil War Memorial in St. Joseph, Michigan. It is on masonry mounting and points west over Lake Michigan.

<text>Shatter cones are rare geological features that are only known to form in the bedrock beneath meteorite impact craters or underground nuclear explosions. They are evidence that the rock has been subjected to a shock with pressures in the range of .

==Morphology==
Shatter cones have a distinctively conical shape that radiates from the top (&quot;apex&quot;) of the cones repeating cone-on-cone in large and small scales in the same sample. Sometimes they have more of a spoon shape on the side of a larger cone. In finer-grained rocks such as limestone, they form an easily recognizable &quot;horsetail&quot; pattern with thin grooves (&quot;&quot;).

Coarser grained rocks tend to yield less well developed shatter cones, which may be difficult to distinguish from other geological formations such as slickensides. Geologists have various theories of what causes shatter cones to form, including compression by the wave as it passes through the rock or tension as the rocks rebound after the pressure subsides. The result is large and small branching fractures throughout the rocks.

Shatter cones can range in size from microscopic to several meters. The largest known shatter cone in the world (more than 10 metres in length) is located at the Slate Islands in Terrace Bay, Ontario, Canada. The azimuths of the cones&#x27; axes typically radiate outwards from the point of impact, with the cones pointing upwards and toward the center of the impact crater, although the orientations of some of the rocks have been changed by post-cratering geological processes at the site.

<doc id="1168063" wikidata="Q1688151" url="?curid=1168063" title="Thomond">
<text>Thomond (Classical Irish: ; Modern Irish: ), also known as the Kingdom of Limerick, was a kingdom of Gaelic Ireland, associated geographically with present-day County Clare and County Limerick, as well as parts of County Tipperary around Nenagh and its hinterland. The kingdom represented the core homeland of the Dál gCais people, although there were other Gaels in the area such as the Éile and Eóganachta, and even the Norse of Limerick. It existed from the collapse of the Kingdom of Munster in the 12th century as competition between the Ó Briain and the Mac Cárthaigh led to the schism between Thomond (&quot;North Munster&quot;) and Desmond (&quot;South Munster&quot;). It continued to exist outside of the Anglo-Norman-controlled Lordship of Ireland until the 16th century.

The exact origin of Thomond, originally as an internal part of Munster, is debated. It is generally held that the Déisi Muman pushed north-west starting from the 5th to the early 8th century, taking the area from the Uí Fiachrach Aidhne of the Connachta. Eventually, the Dál gCais rose to power in all of Munster, to the detriment of the Eóganachta. The person most famously associated with this is Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, best known for his feats at the Battle of Clontarf. Four generations down the line and after providing three more High Kings, the Dál gCais were unable to hold onto all of Munster and so Thomond came into being as a separate entity.

Between the mid-12th and late 13th century, when much of Ireland came under direct English control and/or settlement, Thomond too came into the Anglo-Irish sphere. The de Clare family established a colony at Bunratty, while the Butler and FitzGerald families also made inroads. However, from the time of the Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea, Thomond was restored as a kingdom, with its rulers reinstating Limerick within their overrule. Not until the 1540s did the ruling O&#x27;Brien dynasty come under English rule.

==Geography==
County Clare was sometimes known as County Thomond in the period immediately after its creation from the District of Thomond. In 1841, an estimation of the extent of the kingdom was undertaken by John O&#x27;Donovan and Eugene Curry&quot;The principality of Thomond, generally called the Country of the Dal-Cais, comprised the entire of the present Co. of Clare, the Parishes of Iniscaltra and Clonrush in the County of Galway, the entire of Ely O&#x27;Carroll, the Baronies of Ikerrin, Upper and Lower Ormond, Owney and Arra, and somewhat more than the western half of the Barony of Clanwilliam in the County of Tipperary; the Baronies of Owenybeg, Coonagh and Clanwilliam, and the eastern halves of the Baronies of Small County and Coshlea in the County of Limerick.&quot;

==History==
===Creation from Munster===
The entire province of Munster was under the control of the O&#x27;Brien (Ua Briain) clan under the leadership of Toirrdelbach Ua Briain and his son Muirchertach from 1072 to 1114. Their capital was located in Limerick. In a bid to secure the High Kingship of Ireland for the clan, Muirchertach encouraged ecclesiastical reform in 1111 with the creation of territorial dioceses over the entire island. They had support for their bid from several foreign connections including the Norwegian king Magnus Bareleg and the Anglo-Norman baron Arnulf de Montgomery, who were both united to the clan through marriage in 1102.

Their claim to the High Kingship was countered by the O&#x27;Neill (Uí Néill) clan in Ulster under the leadership of Domnall MacLochlainn of Ailech. Though Muirchertach campaigned hard in the north, he was unable to obtain the submission of Ailech. When he fell ill in 1114 he was deposed by his brother Diarmait. Muirchertach did briefly regain power, but after his death in 1119 his brother&#x27;s sons took control of the clan.

MacLochlainn&#x27;s plans to restore the High Kingship to the north was thwarted by his ally Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair of Connacht who formed an alliance with the O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s. In 1118 Conchobair partitioned Munster between the sons of Diarmait and Tagh Mac Carthaig. The northern section of the province became the O&#x27;Brien Kingdom of Thomond (&quot;Tuadh Mhumhain&quot; &quot;North Munster&quot;) and the southern became the Mac Carthaigh Kingdom of Desmond (&quot;Deas Mhumhain&quot; &quot;South Munster&quot;).

===Normans and civil wars===
From the 12th to the 14th centuries, the Norman invasion and their multiple attempts to take Thomond from the Gaels was the main challenge to the realm. The picture was complicated by rival branches of the Ó Briain having varied political alliances with different Norman families; this created a fractured political sphere in Thomond. At the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, Domhnall Mór Ó Briain was king of Thomond. Domhnall was a man of &quot;realpolitik&quot;; his main concern was upholding his position in Thomond and was not against collaborating with Strongbow and others against rival Gaelic kingdoms such as Ossory, Desmond and Connacht. Domhnall even acknowledged Henry II as Lord of Ireland at Cashel in 1171, but a mere two years later when Plantagenet tried to grant Thomond to Philip de Braose this situation was overturned. The Dál gCais defeated a Norman army at the Battle of Thurles in 1174, where over 1,700 Normans were killed. The following year when Raymond le Gros captured Limerick through a naval invasion, Domhnall re-took it and burned it rather than have it in foreign hands. The twenty years after that were more secure for the Gaels of Thomond.
After the death of Domhnall Mór a period of destructive feuding among his offspring caused a great territorial decline in Thomond. The brothers Muircheartach Finn Ó Briain and Conchobhar Ruadh Ó Briain fought with each other, seeing Muircheartach&#x27;s reign interrupted between 1198 and 1203. Muirchertach himself was blinded by the Normans in 1208 and was soon forced into abdication due to no longer being &quot;righdamhna&quot;. Donnchadh Cairprech Ó Briain had to deal with dissent from the Mac Con Mara and Ó Coinn against his rule, so brought in the Laigin&#x27;s Mac Gormáin as his standard bearers. Donnchadh also enlisted the support of the de Burgh and other Normans in this fight, which came at a costly price; Limerick and lands surrounding it in what would later become County Limerick and County Tipperary. Under pressure from the Butlers, Thomond was now not too different from what would become County Clare, protected by the River Shannon. Donnchadh moved his capital to Clonroad.

The Normans&#x27; advance continued during the reign of Conchobhar na Suidaine Ó Briain, as Henry III &quot;granted&quot; lands to Robert de Muscregos and John Fitzgeoffrey. Of the two de Muscregos was most active, constructing Clare Castle and Bunratty Castle with a colony. The precedent for Thomond was very dangerous as, should much more land have been taken, the realm would have no longer existed. Conchobhar and his fiery son Tadhg Cael Uisce Ó Briain took up arms and slaughtered many of the Norman settler-colonists in 1257. The following year, the Gaelic chiefs from all over Ireland had resolved to form an anti-Norman pact and met at Cael Uisce, near Lough Erne to discuss terms. They planned to resurrect the High Kingship of Ireland, with most supporting Brian Ó Néill as the choice. Tadhg was proud and stubborn, declaring his father should be High King; the Dál gCais thus did not take part in the Battle of Druim Dearg, which the Gaels lost, damaging the reputation of Thomond as a consequence.
Brian Ruadh Ó Briain kept the pressure up by burning Clare Castle and forcing the de Muscregos&#x27; to flee to Wales, but he had troubles from his own countrymen. The Mac Con Mara, Ó Deághaidh and Mac Gormáin clans supported his nephew Toirdelbach Ó Briain, a son of Tadhg Cael Uisce, for the kingship instead and revolted. Seeing an opportunity, Edward II offered Thomond to Thomas de Clare if he could take advantage of the Ó Briain feud. The events which followed have passed down to history as the &quot;Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh&quot;. After Brian briefly regained Clonroad with de Clare&#x27;s help, Toirdelbach arrived with support from Galway in the form of the de Burghs and once again took control in 1277. Brian was executed by his &quot;ally&quot; at Bunratty, but de Clare was soon reconciled with his son Donnchadh mac Brian Ó Briain and supported him against Toirdelbach. The feud continued until Donnchadh drowned at a party on Islandmagrath, on the River Fergus. With Toirdelbach now undisputed king, the Mac Con Mara were able to hound de Clare.

The conflict between the two lines continued into the next generation between Donnchadh mac Toirdelbach Ó Briain (backed by William Liath de Burgh) and Diarmuid Cléirech Ó Briain (backed by Richard de Clare). There was military success at Bunratty in 1311 for Diarmuid and his cousin Donnchadh was killed at Corcomroe. Following this, Clann Tadhg&#x27;s leader was Muircheartach mac Toirdelbach Ó Briain and after Diarmuid&#x27;s &quot;sudden&quot; death, Clann Briain Ruadh&#x27;s leader became Donnchadh mac Domhnall Ó Briain. The Bruce Wars in Ireland added an unpredictable element and saw some surprising &quot;ad hoc&quot; alliances come into play. Donnchadh elected to support Edward the Bruce, which made his patron de Clare an enemy. Muircheartach who now reigned supreme in Thomond, was nominally on the side of the Lordship of Ireland due to his connection to de Burgh. The cousins fought at the Second Battle of Athenry. Muircheartach&#x27;s brother Diarmuid mac Toirdelbach Ó Briain managed to destroy Donnchadh and most of Clann Briain Ruadh&#x27;s supporters at the Battle of Corcomroe in 1317. The end of the de Clares and Norman territorial claims in Thomond came the following year at the Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea, where Conchobhar Ó Deághaidh held out against a larger English force until the O&#x27;Brien and allies could reach the battle and decisively secure victory.

===Unity and resurgence===
The last successful attempt by a Norman to play divide and conquer within the Thomond kingship was the case of Maurice FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond. A very powerful man, he was constantly rumoured during his life to have wanted to make himself King of Ireland. He successfully sponsored Brian Bán Ó Briain in overthrowing Diarmuid from Clan Tadhg during 1343–1350, but equally decisive was the sides taken by Mac Con Mara, leading to Diarmuid&#x27;s restoration. With the exception of a failed Norman attempt to reconstruct Bunratty Castle by Thomas de Rokeby from 1353 to 1355, the Norman settler-colonialist project in Thomond was at an end until the submission of the Ó Briain in the 16th century. The Norman Lordship was weakened by the Bruce Wars of 1315–1318, the Black Death of 1349–1350 (which disproportionally hit Norman controlled towns) and besides that English forces were more invested with the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France and their own internal conflict the Wars of the Roses to focus too much on Ireland. All of these factors allowed for a 15th-century Gaelic resurgence, not only in Thomond but across a significant part of Ireland outside of the Pale.
Brian Bán was the last of Clann Briain Ruadh to hold the kingship and from 1350 onwards, Clann Tadhg held sway. Mathghamhain Maonmhaighe Ó Briain came to power before the death of his uncle Diarmuid and he was named as such because he spent time as a foster child in Máenmaige. His succession was disputed by his uncle and brother; Toirdelbhach Maol Ó Briain and Brian Sreamhach Ó Briain. Of the two Brian Sreamhach gained the upper hand and when his uncle tried to enlist the help of the Earl of Desmond to wrestle back the realm, Brian thoroughly routed them at Croom in a key military success. This had the added benefit of winning back Limerick for Thomond and Sioda Cam Mac Con Mara was placed in the city as a warden in 1369. The friendship with the de Burghs of Galway was maintained by Brian and when Richard II was at Waterford in 1399, he paid nominal homage and was well received. Thomond was now in such a position that Conchobhar mac Mathghamhna Ó Briain&#x27;s twenty six-year reign was marked as a time of peace and plenty.

The years 1426–1459 were marked by a succession of three sons of Brian Sreamhach reigning; Tadhg an Glemore Ó Briain, Mathghamhain Dall Ó Briain and Toirdelbhach Bóg Ó Briain. During this time, Mathghamhain Dall was deposed by his brother Toirdelbhach with the familiar military assistance of the de Burghs (whom he had formed a marriage alliance with). Greater things were to come from the ascent of Toirdelbhach&#x27;s son Tadhg an Chomhaid Ó Briain. From Inchiquin, Tadhg took advantage of the Wars of the Roses, forming an alliance with the Ó Néill in 1464. He managed to ride south through Desmond (the rest of the old Munster) and enforce the &quot;cíos dubh&quot; on the Anglo-Normans. This was a kind of Gaelic &quot;pizzo&quot; which Tadgh&#x27;s great-grandfather Mathghamhain Maonmhaighe had first been able to enforce as a price of protection. His military prowess was such that the Earl of Desmond was forced to give back to Thomond what would later become County Limerick. Mac Fhirbhisigh hints that the men of Leinster planned to raise Tadhg to the High Kingship of Ireland before his death and claims he was the greatest Ó Briain since Brian Bóruma himself.

Thomond was wealthy in the 15th century; Domhnall Mac Gormáin (died 1484) was described as the richest man in Ireland in terms of live stock. During the reign of Conchobhar na Srona Ó Briain, Thomond maintained alliances with the Mac William Uachtar of Clanricarde and the Butlers. In the latter case, they were opposing the Kildare FitzGeralds, earning the ire of Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare who had earned the favour of the new Tudor king Henry VII as Lord Deputy of Ireland. Despite Kildare&#x27;s fearsome reputation, Conchobhar met him in battle at Ballyhickey, near Quin, in 1496 and was successful in turning him back. Toirdelbhach Donn Ó Briain as part of his pact with Ulick Fionn Burke took part in the Battle of Knockdoe in 1504; along with the Mac Con Mara and Ó Briain Ara; against the Earl of Kildare, which they lost. The struggle had been started by a feud between de Burgh and the Ui Maine. Ó Briain later defeated Kildare at Moin na Brathair, near Limerick. Thomond intended to support the Ó Néill against the Ó Domhnaill in a northern feud, but by the time Ó Briain arrived, it was over. Toirdelbhach&#x27;s life came to an end trying to defend the Ó Cearbhaill of Éile from the Earl of Ormond at Camus, near Cashel; he died &quot;by the shot of a ball.&quot;

===Downfall of the realm===

The downfall of Thomond occurred in the 16th century. The series of events leading up to it, were set into process by the rebellion of FitzGerald family member, the Earl of Kildare, Silken Thomas. In 1534, a rumour had spread that his father, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, had been executed in England on the orders of king Henry VIII and that the same fate was planned for him and his uncles. Under this impression, Thomas threw off his offices in the Kingdom of Ireland and rose up in rebellion. He took refuge with the Ó Cearbhaill of Éile and then with Conchobhar mac Toirdhealbaig Ó Briain at Clonroad, Ennis. In hot pursuit, at the head of an army, was Lord Leonard Grey, who destroyed the Killaloe Bridge, which had the result of isolating Thomond from the rest of Ireland and also attacked the Dál gCais east of the River Shannon.

Although the Silken Thomas issue was resolved by late 1535, Thomond had marked itself out by providing refuge to enemies of the Crown of England in Ireland. The English forces had in turn enlisted the services of Conchobhar&#x27;s own son Donnchadh Ó Briain who had cemented an alliance with the Butler family by marrying the daughter of the Earl of Ormond. According to Butler, Donnchadh pledged to help them conquer Thomond, aid English colonisation, adopt English laws and help them take over Carrigogunnell Castle. This castle was a symbol of Gaelic defiance, as it had remained out of Anglo-Norman hands for over 200 years. When the castle was attacked by Grey, it surrendered due to Donnchadh. With the loss of east Thomond and the destruction of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge, Thomond was in a lot of trouble. Conchobhar, along with loyal supporters such as the Mac Con Mara, continued to fight on and managed to conclude a truce with Grey in 1537.

Conchobhar was succeeded on his death by his brother Murchadh Carrach Ó Briain, a man who initially attempted to assist Conn Bacach Ó Néill in the defence of Tír Eoghain but had come to see the futility of his opposition and agreed to surrender and regrant to the Tudor state. The Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland was called to Limerick in 1542 by Lord Deputy Anthony St. Leger regarding the terms of submission of Murchadh Carrach Ó Briain and Sioda Mac Con Mara. Becoming members of the Peerage of Ireland and converting to the Anglican Church, Murchadh was made Earl of Thomond and Donnchadh also Baron Ibrackan. Dissent took place in the form of Donchadh&#x27;s brother Domhnall Ó Briain (and his ally Tadhg Ó Briain) who claimed to have been inaugurated Chief of the Ó Briain according to the Gaelic fashion in 1553. This was in opposition to his nephew the Earl, Conchobhar Groibleach Ó Briain. Tied into English political rivalries, Conchobhar had the support of the Earl of Sussex but was not able to decisively defeat his uncle, indeed Domhnall scored a victory at the Battle of Spancel Hill in 1559. The discord dragged on and Thomond was under the martial law of William Drury as late as 1577. The issues pertaining to tax and land were finalised at the Composition of Thomond in 1585.

==Diocese of Killaloe==
The religion which predominated at an official level in Thomond was Catholic Christianity. The territory of Thomond was associated with the Diocese of Killaloe under the Bishop of Killaloe, the diocese having been formed in 1111 at the Synod of Ráth Breasail, seven years before Thomond broke fully from the Kingdom of Munster. Dál gCais influence over the Bishop of Limerick differed from time to time, with Norman influence also being part of the picture. At the Synod of Kells in 1152, three more sees in Thomond were created in the form of the Diocese of Kilfenora, the Diocese of Roscrea and the Diocese of Scattery Island. Roscrea was re-merged with Killaloe in 1168 and Scattery Island followed in 1189. The latter was re-created briefly during the 14th century before once again being merged back with Killaloe.

Some of the Bishops of Killaloe attended Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church in Rome; this includes Constantín Ó Briain who participated in the Third Lateran Council and Conchobhar Ó hÉanna who was at the Fourth Lateran Council. Religious orders were present in Thomond and had establishments founded by them under the patronage of Kings of Thomond. This includes; the Canons Regular of the Augustinians at Canon Island Abbey, Clare Abbey, Inchicronan Priory, Killone Abbey and Limerick Priory, the Cistercians at Holy Cross Abbey, Corcomroe Abbey, Kilcooly Abbey and Monasteranenagh Abbey, the Franciscans at Ennis Friary, Galbally Friary and Quin Abbey (the latter of which became a formidable college) and the Dominicans at Limerick Blackfriars. There were also many monasteries which predated Thomond such as Inis Cealtra Monastery, Scattery Island Monastery and Dysert O&#x27;Dea Monastery. Both St. Flannan&#x27;s Cathedral in Killaloe and St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Limerick can be traced to Domhnall Mór Ó Briain.

<doc id="1168064" wikidata="Q1241669" url="?curid=1168064" title="Donkey jacket">
<text>A donkey jacket is a medium-length workwear jacket, typically made of unlined black or dark blue thick Melton woollen fabric, with the shoulders back and front reinforced and protected from rain with leather or PVC panels.

Originating in the United Kingdom, the garment is untailored at the waist such that it hangs down straight from the shoulders. The front vertical edges fall straight and are squared-off at the bottom edge which is also straight horizontally with no vent at the back. In length it reaches below the crotch area. It has no lapels and is closed by four to five buttons at the front that fasten tightly up to the neck with a broad and stiff turn-up collar, allowing the wearer to protect the neck from wind, cold and wet weather. It is thus well suited to outdoors work in demanding conditions.

== Origins ==

In 1888 George Key opened up his own shop above his father John Key&#x27;s first-floor draper shop on Lower Brook Street in Rugeley, Staffordshire, England. That same year, Key designed a new type of coat made of a hard-wearing material developed for those who were working on the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. Some of the navvies worked on donkey engines (a steam-powered winch or logging engine), providing the inspiration for the name of George Key&#x27;s new coat: the donkey jacket.

== Design ==
The donkey jacket is derived from the wool sack coat worn by workers in the 19th century, and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; references the term as first used in 1929: &quot;one with leather shoulders and back&quot;. The jacket usually has two capacious side pockets, and sometimes an inside &quot;poacher&#x27;s pocket&quot;.

Later versions replaced the leather with a PVC panel covering the shoulder-blade areas. This could be fluorescent orange or yellow and is sometimes branded with the name of the company which supplied the jacket, or the name of the company for which the wearer worked.

== Social significance ==
The donkey jacket is regarded as typical of the British manual labourer and trade unionist as well as members of the political left. It is also favoured by traditionalist Teddy boys, Rockabillys and skinheads. Former British Labour Party leader Michael Foot was criticised for wearing what was described incorrectly as a &quot;donkey jacket&quot; at a Remembrance Day wreath-laying ceremony and he was shown wearing one on several covers of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Foot&#x27;s office insisted it was actually a &quot;very expensive short overcoat&quot; chosen by his wife, from Harrods.

<doc id="1168066" wikidata="Q1810996" url="?curid=1168066" title="Nissan Laurel">
<text>The is a two- and four-door sedan manufactured and marketed by Nissan from 1968 to 2002. Later generations added all-wheel-drive along with turbocharged engines. Introduced in 1968 as a new model positioned above the Datsun Bluebird 510, the Laurel offered the luxury of the Nissan Gloria A30 in a shorter wheelbase, and always was the luxury version of the Skyline range for all generations, sharing engines, suspensions and handling dynamics of the popular performance coupe and sedan while having a longer wheelbase.

The first Laurel was developed by the Nissan Tsurumi R&amp;D Division and assembled at the Musashimurayama Plant of the former Prince Motor Company in 2-door and 4-door variants beginning in 1968. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; as the junior model to the Nissan Cedric and executive limousine, V8-powered Nissan President.

The Laurel, and its Skyline twin, saw yearly equipment, appearance and trim package changes, so as to appear fresh and new, and every four to five years were given an all-new appearance, while core technology that were tested and reliable remained underneath. 

Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various Asian, European and South American markets, labeled as the Datsun Laurel or Datsun 200L until exports from Japan ended after 1989. The Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan&#x27;s alliance with Renault.

The name &quot;&quot; is in reference to a laurel wreath, a symbol of triumph and is worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck.

== First generation (C30; 1968) ==
In April 1968, Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L inline-four engine, and in June 1970 a two-door hardtop coupé joined the lineup. The Laurel was conceived as a junior version of the all-new Gloria before Nissan acquired Prince, and one year later a 2000 cc engine became available in the four-door sedan as well. The focus on a luxurious appearance had appeared in 1962 with the Nissan Skyline Sport with an exotic, European influenced appearance. Its competitors at introduction were the 1968 Toyota Corona Mark II sedan, and the Mazda Luce which was introduced in 1966. 

The Laurel did not sell as well as expected, largely because the design was too similar to that of the smaller, modestly priced Bluebird (510) which was developed as a competitor before Nissan bought Prince. The Bluebird was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot;, alongside the higher-content luxury Laurel.

This car was developed by the Nissan Tsurumi vehicle development team, but the C30 Laurel was fitted with the Prince four-cylinder SOHC engine, the G18 of 1,815 cc capacity. Conversely, the GC10 Skyline 2000GT was developed by the former Prince Ogikubo vehicle development team but was fitted with Nissan&#x27;s L20 six-cylinder SOHC engine. The suspension is the same MacPherson struts for all wheels and Semi-trailing arm independent suspension for the rear wheels that was fitted on the C10 Skyline. August 1970 saw the release of a modified version of the four-door sedan version, now with the same roof angle as that of the hard top. The instrument panel received redesigned panel meters, and the more luxurious GL grade was added.

===2000GX===
The Laurel 2000GX, Nissans first hardtop, was introduced June 1970 and was equipped with the Prince developed SOHC 1,990 cc G20-series four-cylinders with either a single or SU twin-carburetor. The single carburetor generated at 5600RPM, the dual carburetor generated at 5800rpm, and the premium fuel dual carburetor generated at 5800rpm. The Laurel hardtop coupe was introduced before the SOHC 2000 GT-X with the L20SU straight-six engine that appeared later in October. The 2000GX used the same chassis as the GT-X and GT-R while having a longer wheelbase. The GT-R garnered most of the attention, having been raced and built for that purpose, while the 2000GX was developed for comfortable yet spirited performance. The 2000GX used the same 5-speed manual transmission, an available limited slip differential, and also used semi-trailing arm strut suspension, with disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. A feature that was unique to the 2000GX was the stylish at the time sequential rear turn signals, where three light blubs would flash from the center to the outer edge on both the coupe and sedan. All Laurel coupes were also given a vinyl roof as standard equipment.
 


== Second generation (C130; 1972) ==
In April 1972, the second Laurel generation appeared, again in four-door saloon and two-door hardtop coupé form affectionately known as the &quot;Butaketsu&quot; Laurel (&quot;pig butt&quot;) because of its ample rear quarter panels and tail section, with the taillights incorporated into the rear bumper. The saloon continued to use MacPherson struts for the front wheels but now used a rear beam axle and semi-elliptic leaf spring. 

The hardtop coupé continued to share MacPherson struts for the front wheels and Semi-trailing arm for the rear suspension, and again shared with the 2000 GTX-E. The styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 Ford Torino and the 1971 Mercury Cougar, reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called &quot;coke bottle&quot;, and continued a softer appearance to the edgier Skyline.

The G-20 4-cylinder and L20 six-cylinder engines were equipped with SU twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations. Engines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815 cc G18 and 1990 cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998 cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburetors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a &quot;Twin Carburetor 2000GX&quot; badge.

Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three-quarters sedans. The Toyota competitor was the Mark II coupé and sedan.
In October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565 cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as &quot;2600SGL&quot;. Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the size limits imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual road tax.

In September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753 cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770 cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.

In February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the Nissan NAPS badge.

=== Laurel C130-EV===
In 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel. The Nissan Laurel C130-EV - referred to as the Datsun 200L-EV in export markets - developed to be used by the VIPs at the 1975 International Oceanographic Exposition in Okinawa. It was originally engineered by the Prince Motor Company, but produced by Nissan when the company assumed Prince operations in 1966.

The C130-EV uses one electric motor, rear-mounted and driving the rear axle through a two-speed automatic transmission. The Nissan Laurel C130-EV has a claimed top speed of and a range of . Nissan&#x27;s next electric car venture would be the 1998 Altra.

== Third generation (C230; 1977) ==
The third generation appeared in January 1977. For the first time, the C230 was available in either saloon and hardtop coupé form, but also as a hardtop saloon without B-posts. The hardtop was only available with six-cylinder engines. Buyers could choose between a 1.8-litre four, a 2.0-litre inline-six (carburetted or fuel-injected, a first for the Laurel), a 2.8-litre six, or a 2.0-litre diesel four, sourced from Nissan Diesel as an alternative to the diesel-powered Toyota Mark II and the Isuzu Florian. Transmissions were mainly four- or five-speed manuals or a three-speed automatic, although a three-speed manual with a column shift was also available in the lower spec and commercial versions. 

In the Autumn of 1978, the C230 received a mild facelift (type C231), marked visually by squared instead of round double headlights. The Toyota competitor was the Mark II coupé and sedan. Again, comfort was prioritized over handling and agility, while still using the identical MacPherson struts for the front wheels and Semi-trailing arm for the rear suspension from the Skyline.
One year later (January 1978) Nissan released a tenth anniversary edition, which adopted a special deep red body color known as &quot;Laurel&#x27;s Crimson&quot;, as well as trim-specific emblems, aluminum wheels and front grille. In 1979, the 2.4-litre L24 engine was added to the lineup. European outputs were DIN for the 2.0 and the 2.4 inline-sixes. European buyers were attracted to the Laurel for its overall reliability, low price, and ample equipment. Datsun-Nissan South Africa also developed a two-litre four-cylinder option not offered elsewhere to suit local needs with a lower-cost, torquier engine than the two-litre six sold elsewhere. The L20B engine offered and was paired with somewhat lower equipment than the 280L sold alongside it.

November 1978 brought minor changes to the Laurel, including squaring off of the front headlights. The highest trim level, &quot;Medalist&quot;, received air conditioning in addition to its OHC four-cylinder two-litre diesel engine. The 1800 cc cars switched to the newer Z18 crossflow engine and all Laurels now met the Showa 53 (1979) gasoline vehicle emission regulations. The &quot;Medalist&quot; trim package name would continue until 1999 when the Laurel was cancelled.
Later, in October 1979, a two-litre four-cylinder gasoline option (Z20-series) was added in several markets. Also new were the options of automatic transmission and the SGL equipment grade on diesel vehicles.

In February 1980, an electric sunroof was added to the hardtop version of the Medalist. This was the first year in which a sunroof was a model option.
In July 1980, a special limited edition &quot;gold medalist&quot; top-of-the-line trim was released.
== Fourth generation (C31; 1980) ==
The C31 model, introduced in November 1980, was the first model that was only available in a four-door form, either as a sedan or hardtop. Engines for the C31 were 1.8-liter, 2.0-liter L20, 2.4-liter L24 gasoline, and 2.8-liter diesel. The coupé was replaced by the new Nissan Leopard F30, while the Laurel and Leopard continued to use the same MacPherson struts for the front wheels and semi-trailing arm with 4-links for the rear suspension from the Skyline. The Laurel remained exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot;, the Skyline at &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot;, and the new Leopard coupe and sedan were exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; remaining as an upscale alternative to the Bluebird, while the Laurel added more luxury equipment and a price point to match.

The Toyota competitor was the Cresta hardtop while the Skyline was an alternative to the Chaser performance sedan. November 1982 saw the introduction of the exclusive &quot;Laurel Turbo Medalist Givenchy Version&quot; with Hubert de Givenchy doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the Lincoln Continental Mark IV. The Givenchy was the top trim package, painted in Dark Charcoal over Siver two-tone paint, with contrasting medium brown cloth upholstery with the Givenchy logo pattern woven into the fabric. In 1981, the Nissan Laurel Spirit, exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations, was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car.
Development Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel&#x27;s redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment.

In February 1981, the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981, the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.
In September 1982, there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large-scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The taillamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809 cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time.

In November 1982, the Turbo Medalist Givenchy Version II was released. In February 1983, the &quot;50 Special&quot; released. In March, the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May, another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July, electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added. SGL Grand Touring car (with a hubcap for Medalist colored bumper and large) and 50 Special Release III.

January 1984 saw the abolition of the 1.8-litre GL models, while the Turbo Medalist Givenchy III limited edition also went on sale.
European export models received the carburetted 2.0 (DX or SGL trim) and 2.4 inline-sixes (SGL), with and respectively, or with the large 2.8 diesel with . A fuel injected 2.4 with later appeared for some markets. The 2.4-liter six only developed in Swedish-market petrol cars as a result of that country&#x27;s stringent emissions standards. As large Japanese cars are not very popular with private buyers in Europe, the diesel saw the lion&#x27;s share of sales, mainly for taxi usage. Fitted with a detuned version of the L24 engine, the Laurel was introduced to the Middle Eastern (mainly Saudi) market in 1982.


== Fifth generation (C32; 1984) ==
Most of the information in this article was translated from the Nissan Laurel article on Japanese Wikipedia at :ja:日産・ローレル.
In October 1984, the C32 Laurel was released. Osamu Ito, Development Supervisor of the R31/32 Skyline, was assigned to redesign the Laurel. He saw the car needed significant changes and set about doing so. Some of the Laurel&#x27;s new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, and a more overall angular appearance, and also introduced the world&#x27;s first electric retractable door mirrors. The C32 was the last model to be sold in Europe, where the Laurel was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Nissan Maxima (PU11) which was not available as a diesel and had a sportier, more luxurious air.

The C32 were fitted with a variety of gasoline engines, inline-fours and V6 engines ranging from 1.8 to 3.0 liters. Some engines, like the L24 and the electronically carbureted VG30S were reserved for export. The C32 Laurel also came with the LD28 diesel. In 1987, there were a minor facelift which revised the bumpers, new grilles and new lights in the front and back. The LD28 diesel engine were swapped out in favor of the similarly dimensioned RD28. This generation was the only Laurel to be equipped with a V6 engine. The suspension remained as the MacPherson struts for the front wheels and semi-trailing arm with 4-links for the rear suspension from the Skyline.

If the Laurel was installed with the &quot;Super Sonic Suspension&quot; system, a sonar module was mounted under the front bumper and scanned the road surface, adjusting the suspension accordingly via actuators mounted on all four coil over shock absorbers and the front suspension was installed with a multi-link suspension. There was also a switch on the center console that allowed the driver to limit the adjustment information being provided by the sonar sensor, and change the setting from &quot;Auto&quot; to &quot;Soft&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Hard&quot; settings. The speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering could also be separately reduced for a sporting feeling, and the suspension setting would modify both the steering feel and the shift points on the automatic transmission.

The Medalist could be optionally installed with a 6-inch CRT TV screen installed in the dashboard below the A/C controls that allowed passengers to watch broadcast TV if the transmission was in Park and the parking brake applied. The screen was not touch sensitive, and didn&#x27;t offer a CD-ROM based navigation system. The display also showed AM/FM stereo settings. The video entertainment system also had RCA connections to attach a camcorder and watch recorded video. The stereo and video equipment was supplied by Sony. Also available was a modification to the front passenger seat Nissan called &quot;Partner Comfort Seat&quot; where the top portion of the front passenger seat was further articulated to tilt forward, supporting the passengers shoulders while allowing the seatback structure to recline. The front edge of the passenger seat cushion was also adjustable.

To enhance rear passenger comfort and convenience, the four-door hardtop front driver and passenger seat belt shoulder strap was connected at the top to the ceiling, however, the upper portion could be detached, with the shoulder strap emerging from the side door support, resting on the driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s shoulder. This provided rear passengers an unobstructed view from the rear seat without the seat belt hanging from the ceiling when the windows were retracted. The upper part would then swing up to the ceiling and could be fastened into place. 
The styling of the Nissan Laurel began to resemble the larger Gloria but on a slightly smaller platform, with reduced tax liability based on the vehicles dimensions. The Toyota competitor was the Cresta hardtop, while the Skyline was the competitor to the Chaser sedan and in 1986, the Honda Vigor.

The RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L V6 turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car&#x27;s system also shared a Skyline rack-and-pinion steering rack.
In May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986.

In October 1986, there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine.

In May 1987, the &quot;Grande Extra White Special&quot; edition was released. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup.

Beginning January 1988, the Laurel was joined by a longer version at of the Nissan Gloria stablemate, called the Nissan Gloria Cima which offered an improved version of the V6 engine available on the Laurel, and an optionally available turbocharged version of the same V6.
In February 1988, there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the &quot;White Limited&quot; model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December, private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989, Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock.
The taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the Nissan Crew.


== Sixth generation (C33; 1989) ==
Most of the information in this article was translated from the Nissan Laurel article on Japanese Wikipedia at :ja:日産・ローレル.
Benefiting from Project 901, the C33 Laurel was announced in December 1988. In January 1989, the C33 went on sale and was now only available as a four-door hardtop. The base engine carried over from the previous generation, offering a 1.8-litre four; the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC, or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991, a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed automatic became available.
The C33, in particular, is very popular as a &quot;drift car,&quot; because it has the same floor plan as the Nissan A31 Cefiro and the four-door Nissan Skyline R32. They also have many interchangeable parts, which makes them ideal for modification. The suspension continued to offer MacPherson struts for all wheels but now offered multi-links for the rear suspension from the Skyline, including HICAS II rear-wheel steering.

The Toyota competitor was the Cresta while the new Honda Inspire, Mitsubishi Emeraude and the new Mazda luxury sedan ɛ̃fini MS-8 were also alternatives in the increasing crowded segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the more senior Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria, which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (&quot;Nissan Store&quot; for the Cedric, &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; for the Gloria). The Laurel remained exclusive to Japanese dealership &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations.

The four-door hardtop front driver and passenger seat belt shoulder strap were connected at the top to the ceiling to enhance rear passenger comfort and convenience. However, the upper portion could be detached, with the shoulder strap emerging from the side door support, resting on the driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s shoulders. This provided rear passengers with an unobstructed view from the rear seat without the seat belt hanging from the ceiling when the windows were retracted. The upper part would then swing up to the ceiling and could be fastened into place. Trim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S, and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 Laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18, and RD28 engines.
V6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. Four-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications.
In January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted, and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. In November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L added a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models are equipped with previous-generation high-mount side lamps and side-door airbags. The DUET-SS Super Sonic Suspension was also introduced as an extra-cost option on Gran Limited-equipped vehicles.
By January 1992, cumulative production achieved 2 million units. 
== Seventh generation (C34; 1993) ==
Most of the information in this article was translated from the Nissan Laurel article on Japanese Wikipedia at :ja:日産・ローレル.
The new Laurel C34 was released in January 1993. To meet stricter side-impact legislation, it was no longer available in a pillarless hardtop sedan configuration; the single-body style offered was a regular saloon with B-posts. Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six, and a 2.8 L diesel six. The diesel engine now had three valves per cylinder, for a total of 18. This series offered broader and longer body dimensions, which meant that under Japanese dimension regulations, all Laurels were now in the large car category, including models with engines displacing less than 2 liters. Japanese owners were now liable for additional taxes paid yearly in addition to standard registration, road tax, and inspection costs. Large cars have a leading &quot;3&quot; at the top of the license plate, while compact cars have a &quot;5&quot;. Manufacturing remained at the Murayama plant. The smaller Laurel Spirit was replaced by the all-new Nissan Presea.

Some of the later models featured more sophistication, such as Nissan&#x27;s proprietary 4-wheel steering (Super HICAS) or 4-wheel drive (ATTESA E-TS) systems, which were shared with the Skyline models, along with ABS brakes. The Laurel also offered ASCD (auto speed control) with steering wheel switches on the top-of-the-line Medalist VG Selection. A 5-speed manual transmission was only available in the Medalist diesel version, with no manually shifted gasoline cars offered. Diesel and single-cam gasoline cars received four-speed automatics; more powerful gasoline cars all got a five-speed automatic. The suspension and trim packages now differed based on whether it was RWD or AWD. If it was rear-drive &quot;Medalist&quot;, it was MacPherson struts for the front wheels but now offered multi-links for the rear suspension from the Skyline. If it was the AWD &quot;Club&quot; trim package, it used the multi-link for the front wheels to accommodate ATTESA.

In May 1993, an RB20E-engined Club S was added, as the 2.5-only Club S was not a strong seller. In July and August 1993, special editions were launched to celebrate Nissan&#x27;s 60th anniversary, the Medalist S 60th Anniversary, and the Club SJ 60th Anniversary, respectively.

January 1994 saw a mid-life facelift for the C34 Laurel. Medalist versions received a center grille finisher, while the Club S received a sportier-looking grille and an exclusive front bumper design, necessitating other minor changes around the front end. Medalist and Club S specifications were more differentiated than before. The Club S also received a new engine, the turbocharged 24-valve DOHC RB25DET straight-six, while the 24-valve RB20DE model was discontinued. The turbo version received a four-speed automatic, as the engine produces too much torque for the five-speed JATCO RE5R01A. 

The new Club S Type X was a more expensive version. At the same time, the regular Club S received a few downgrades, such as a Premium Tricot interior rather than the earlier Ultrasuede, which was now only a cost option on the Type X. The Medalist J and the basic Grand Cruise model was replaced by the Medalist L and the Grand Saloon. Minor cost-cutting led to Medalists using wheel trims shared with other Nissan automobiles. At the same time, the stereo head was changed from a Laurel-only dedicated size to a single DIN regular format.
The Laurel underwent a minor change in September 1994, with a significant rear-end redesign. Front-end design remained largely untouched, while a driver&#x27;s SRS airbag became standard fitment. New was the first four-wheel-drive Laurel and a Medalist Turbo model. The Medalist Turbo received the same sporty-looking front end as the Club S. In January 1995, a new, well-equipped Club S Selection was introduced. In September 1995, another special edition appeared, the 20E-engined Medalist Dual Limited.

A final update took place in May 1996. The steering wheel design was changed, and a passenger airbag became standard. More special editions also appeared in the form of the &quot;Celencia,&quot; which received dedicated seat fabric, a unique grille, and tinted window glass. In February 1997, the ABS-equipped Celencia SV and Celencia Medalist SV appeared. Production ended in May 1997, with sales continuing from stock until the eighth generation Laurel replaced it.

== Eighth generation (C35; 1997) ==
Most of the information in this article was translated from the Nissan Laurel article on Japanese Wikipedia at :ja:日産・ローレル.

The eighth and last generation debuted in June 1997. Holding to traditional product refreshes, the C35 Laurel remained consistent with its established role as the slightly longer Skyline. It has a softer appearance and a luxury approach to equipment, performance, handling, and market value in an ever-increasing competitive market. Competition grew from within, with the Cedric and Gloria Gran Turismo, the Cima Grand Touring, and the growing international popularity of the Skyline. Economic conditions were having a substantial effect on sales as the &quot;bubble economy&quot; began to collapse. Starting in 1999, the Nissan Japanese dealership network was reorganized, and the Laurel was now available at &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; locations. The Laurel was now in a more crowded list of available performance luxury sedans.

The available engines were the RB25DET NEO turbo, the RB25DE NEO engine, the RB20DE NEO, and all were updated with Nissan variable valve timing technology called NEO. The RD28E diesel SOHC I6 remained. The only transmission available was the four-speed automatic, while the Dualmatic M-ATx automatic transmission with manual mode was optional for all RWD vehicles. The model number is HC35 for the 2000cc model, GC35 for the 2WD model (GCC35 for SUPER HICAS specification)/GNC35 for the 4WD model, and SC35 for the diesel engine model.

The suspension package remained the same as the previous generation, whether it was RWD or AWD, and the last separation generation continued; the Medalist was RWD, and the Club was RWD or optional AWD. If it was rear-drive, it was MacPherson struts for the front wheels but now offered multi-links for the rear suspension from the Skyline. If it was AWD, it used the multi-link for all wheels to accommodate ATTESA E-TS and was identified as &quot;2.5 Club S-Four&quot;. In October 1997, a special trim package was offered called the &quot;25 Club S 30th Anniversary&quot; released to commemorate Laurel&#x27;s 30th anniversary, and was only painted in Red Pearl with 15&quot; aluminum alloy wheels.

The all-new telematics in-car navigation system called Compass Link was installed as an extra-cost option in all trim packages beginning with this generation. Vehicles equipped were the Medalist NAVI Edition and subsequent special editions with the NAVI badge.

In March 2001, production at Murayama ended, and all production was transferred to Tochigi. In late 2002, Laurel&#x27;s production ended after 35 years. The competitors were the Toyota Cresta and the Honda Inspire. It was replaced in 2003 by the Nissan Teana.

<text>Hastinapur is a city in the Meerut district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. &quot;Hastinapura&quot; is described as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom in Hindu texts such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the Puranas; it is also mentioned in ancient Jain texts. Hastinapur is located on the right bank of the Ganga river.

==Etymology==
In Sanskrit, &quot;Hastinapura&quot; translates to &#x27;the City of Elephants&#x27; from &quot;Hastina&quot; (elephant) and &quot;pura&quot; (city). Its history dates back to the period of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It is said that the city was named after King Hasti.

It is also mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the 13th and 14th verses of which say (translated):

==History==
The early archaeological remains of the region belong to Ochre Coloured Pottery culture which was a Bronze Age culture of Ganga Yamuna doab. Around c.1200 BCE the region transformed to an Iron Age culture. The region was occupied by the Painted Grey Ware culture which corresponds to the Vedic Period.

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Hastinapur is portrayed as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom of the Kauravas. Many incidents in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; were set in the city of Hastinapur. According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the 100 Kaurava brothers were born in this city to their mother, Queen Gandhari, the wife of King Dhritarashtra. On the bank of the Budhi Ganga, two places near Hastinapur (Draupadi Ghat and Karna Ghat) reference &quot;Mahabharata&quot; personages.

The first reference to Hastinapur in the Puranas presents the city as the capital of Emperor Bharata&#x27;s kingdom.
Excavations at Hastinapur were carried out in the early 1950s by B. B. Lal, Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India. Although the main aim of this excavation, according to Lal himself, was to determine the stratigraphic position of Painted Grey Ware concerning other known ceramic industries of the early historical period, Lal found correlations between the text of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the material remains that he unearthed at Hastinapur. This led him to historicize some of the traditions mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as well as link the appearance of the Painted Grey Ware with Aryans in the upper Ganges basin areas.

Hastinapur is listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Delhi sarkar, producing a revenue of 4,466,904 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 300 infantry and 10 cavalry. The author Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak describes it &quot;an ancient Hindu settlement&quot; lying on the Ganges.

In British India, Hastinapur was ruled by Raja Nain Singh Nagar, who built many Hindu temples in and around Hastinapura.

<doc id="1168072" wikidata="Q1068935" url="?curid=1168072" title="Nissan Teana">
<text>The is a mid-size sedan produced by Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan. It was exported as the Nissan Maxima and Nissan Cefiro to certain markets. It replaces the Nissan Bluebird, Laurel and Cefiro. It shares a platform with the Nissan Maxima and Nissan Altima which are sold in North America, as well as the Japanese market Presage minivan. The Teana has been available in East Asia, Russia, Ukraine, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the Caribbean.

As of 2007 the Teana shares its platform with its French cousin, the Renault Laguna and Renault Latitude in most of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and in Southeast Asia as the Renault Samsung SM5.

With the introduction of the Teana, Nissan continued the J lineage for the model codes (J31 and J32) from the Nissan Maxima (J30). Starting with the introduction of the third generation in 2013, the Teana became a badge engineered version of the North American Altima. The Teana nameplate was retired in 2020, being replaced by the L34 Altima or discontinued without any successor in some markets.

The name &quot;Teana&quot; is from that of a small village in Italy, sharing a naming influence for the Nissan Murano which was released in the same era, which was named after another city in Italy.


== First generation (J31; 2003) ==

The J31 series Teana was first introduced in February 2003 to the Japanese market as a sedan companion to the Murano with both vehicles exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot;. It replaced the Bluebird and Cefiro in Japan, along with the Laurel. It was considered one level below the Skyline. The Teana was designed around a cosseting, homelike interior with colours and materials inspired by interior design rather than the technological style used in most cars at the time. It was introduced with an optionally available internet-based, telematics and GPS navigation system called CarWings to Japanese drivers only.

The J31 Teana follows the same chassis number pattern as the Maxima (J30).

Despite being largely unrelated to its longrunning Cefiro line, Nissan marketed the Teana using the &quot;Cefiro&quot; nameplate in Hong Kong, Singapore, Mauritius, Brunei, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Latin America and Caribbean while it was sold under the name of Teana in Japan, Thailand, Philippines, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The car was marketed as the Maxima in Australia and New Zealand.

In most of the world, the Teana was Nissan&#x27;s largest front-wheel drive sedan, while the Skyline and Fuga are rear-wheel drive, with optional all-wheel drive.

It was introduced a month later to other Asian markets like Singapore. In 2004 the car arrived on European shores, replacing the Maxima QX.

Powering the Teana was either a 1998 cc, 2349 cc or 3498 cc engine matched to automatic transmissions. Power outputs vary somewhat between the different markets. Trim levels were 200JK, 230JK, 230JM and 350JM. The car was based on the Nissan FF-L platform. In December 2005, the Teana received new headlights and taillights, chrome trimming on the bumpers, enlarged foglights, front legrests and newly designed gauges. The car was also shortened slightly, and the clear rear turn signals were replaced by amber ones. XTronic CVT was also mated to all the engines.

In mainland China, the Teana was manufactured by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture with Nissan. In Taiwan, it was manufactured by Yulon Motor. In the neighbouring country of Pakistan, the Teana was known as the Cefiro and was assembled in Karachi. Additionally, it was sold in India, Russia, Ukraine as well as in New Zealand and Australia where it competes with the locally produced Mitsubishi 380 and Toyota Aurion under the Maxima badge. The first generation Teana was also assembled in Thailand for sale in the Southeast Asian market.

A restyled version was sold in South Korea as the Renault Samsung SM7. In January 2005, Renault Samsung announced a lower-specification version of the Teana which it sold as the second generation (A34R) Renault Samsung SM5 and, from 2008, as the Renault Safrane.

In some countries, the 200JK was not sold. This was replaced by the 230JK, basically a 230JM with less equipment. In Australia, the Maxima was sold in ST-L, Ti and Ti-L trim levels. The Ti-L trim was dropped after the facelift in 2005.

In 2008, Nissan stopped production of the J31 but production continued in Thailand until 2009.

=== Engines and specifications ===
The first generation Teana utilized a number of engines, namely the QR20DE, VQ23DE and a slightly detuned version of the VQ35DE.


== Second generation (J32; 2008) ==


Nissan revealed the second generation, redesigned Teana at the 2008 Beijing Auto Show.

The new Teana is based on the Nissan D platform also used by the new North American Nissan Maxima and Nissan Altima. Engine choices include a 3498 cc V6, a 2495 cc V6, a 2488 cc inline-four, and a 1997 cc inline-four, all with a continuously variable transmission. The car&#x27;s design was previewed by the Intima concept car shown in October 2007.

The car was launched in Japan, Taiwan, India, Iran, Mauritius, Russia, China, Brunei, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia.

This generation was not sold in Europe, where its French cousin, the Renault Laguna was offered, alongside the longer Renault Latitude.

Nissan continues to offer an optionally available internet-based, telematics and GPS navigation system called CarWings to Japanese drivers only.

From this generation forward, the car stereo system had an optionally available feature called Music Box which allowed users to record CDs and listen to them. This system was also available on the Maxima and Altima.

The Teana shares most of the platform and mechanicals with its North American cousin, the Altima which is built and sold primarily in North America. The J32 has been sold in Australia as a Maxima since June 2009 with model designations of 250 ST-L, 350 ST-S and 350 Ti. These models have features unique to Australia and New Zealand including alloy wheel design, rear spoiler and interior upholstery fittings. In late 2011, all three Australian models received an equipment upgrade, with prices remaining unchanged. The Cefiro nameplate has been discontinued on the second-generation line.

=== Specifications ===
The second generation Teana utilized different engines, namely the MR20DE (successor of the QR series), VQ25DE and the VQ35DE, which was tweaked to produce 20 more PS. The Japanese-exclusive model, &quot;FOUR&quot; used a QR25DE engine.


== Third generation (L33; 2013) ==
The third generation Teana was introduced in 2013 to some markets as a rebadged version of the North American L33 Altima.

<doc id="1168073" wikidata="Q16932" url="?curid=1168073" title="Kashima Antlers">
<text>are a professional football club based in Kashima, Ibaraki, Japan. They currently play in the J1 League, the top tier of Japanese professional football leagues. The club has financial backing from Mercari, a Japanese e-commerce company.

Since the J.League&#x27;s creation and introduction of professional Japanese football in 1993, Kashima have proven themselves to be by far Japan&#x27;s most successful football club in terms of trophies won, having won the J1 League title a record 8 times, the J.League Cup a record 6 times, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup 5 times and the Japanese Super Cup a record 6 times for an unprecedented nineteen major domestic titles. Continentally, Kashima became Asian champions when they won the AFC Champions League in 2018. The club also won the J.League Cup / Copa Sudamericana Championship on 2 occasions in 2012 and 2013.

Internationally, Kashima has made two appearances in the FIFA Club World Cup where in the 2016 edition, the club qualified as the host of the tournament. Kashima notably became the only club to qualify from the first round until the final where they would go on to lose to 2015–16 UEFA Champions League winners, Real Madrid 4–2 after extra time with Gaku Shibasaki scoring both goals for Kashima.

Kashima are also one of only two clubs to have competed in Japan&#x27;s professional top-flight football every year since its inception (the other being Yokohama F. Marinos).

==History==
The name &#x27;Antlers&#x27; is derived from the city of Kashima (鹿嶋), which literally translates to &#x27;Deer Island&#x27;. The club crest not only resembles deer antlers but it also reflects the image of rose thorn as it is the official flower of Ibaraki, the home prefecture of the club. Deer are amiable animals and are viewed in some religions as spiritual messengers. In fact, Kashima Shrine, one of the most famous shrines in Japan and located in close proximity to the club headquarters, have kept and raised deer for more than 1,300 years as spiritual symbol.
Founded in 1947 as Sumitomo Metal Industries Factory Football Club in Osaka and moved to Kashima, Ibaraki in 1975. It played in the semi-professional Japan Soccer League (JSL). They were promoted to the JSL&#x27;s top flight in 1984, but never made much of an impact, going down in 1985/86, returning in 1986/87 and going down again in 1988/89. Its last standing in the JSL was 2nd in the Second Division for 1991/92. In October 1991, Kashima Antlers FC Co., Ltd. was established with investment from 43 companies (at the time) from 5 local governments.

After the formation of the fully professional J.League, Sumitomo, like all other clubs, stripped the corporate brand from the club&#x27;s name and reformed as the Kashima Antlers in April 1992. Kashima was essentially promoted to the new top flight, as many JSL First Division clubs decided to relegate themselves being unprepared for professionalism. (Of the original 10 J.League founding member clubs, Kashima and Shimizu S-Pulse were newly promoted. Ironically, Kashima had defeated a forerunner of Shimizu&#x27;s, Nippon Light Metal/Hagoromo Club, to earn its JSL Second Division place back in 1974).

Since the J.League&#x27;s creation and introduction of professional Japanese football in 1993, Kashima have consistently been amongst the strongest clubs in the country, holding several distinctions and records. Led by former Brazil national team star and Japan national team coach Zico in the club&#x27;s formative years, Kashima were the first club to win a J.League stage, claiming the 1st stage of the inaugural season in 1993. This laid a platform for continuous greatness and long after the Kashima icon had departed, in 2000 Kashima became the first J.League club to achieve the &quot;treble&quot;, by winning all three major titles: J.League, J.League Cup, and Emperor&#x27;s Cup in the same year.

In recent times, by clinching the 2007 J.League title they became the first and only club in Japan to have won ten domestic titles in the professional era. In 2008 they became the first and only club to successfully defend the J.League title on two occasions. In 2009 they became the first and only club to win three consecutive J.League titles. With victories in back to back J.League Cups in 2011, 2012 and most recently followed by their 2015 victory, Kashima extended their unmatched record of major domestic titles in the professional era to seventeen.To this day, Kashima has maintained strong ties with the football community in Brazil, a fact borne out of Zico&#x27;s past affiliation with the club. Kashima&#x27;s Brazilian connection has manifested itself in both the club&#x27;s player transfer and coaching policy resulting in only three non-Brazilian foreign players and predominantly Brazilian managers signing for Kashima since the inception of the J.League.

The population of Kashima city is a mere 60,000 and for that reason club has also adopted the surrounding cities of Itako, Kamisu, Namegata and Hokota as its official hometowns, all in Ibaraki Prefecture. The combined population of five cities is 280,000. Antlers home games are played at Kashima Soccer Stadium, one of the 2002 FIFA World Cup venues with capacity of 40,000.

During the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, Kashima became the first Asian club to reach the FIFA Club World Cup final and notably became the only club to qualify from the first round until the final following a 3–0 victory over South American winners, Atlético Nacional. In the final, after a 2–2 draw against European champions Real Madrid after 90 minutes, they were beaten 4–2 after extra time.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; manga series, two characters were players of Kashima Antlers. The Brazilian midfielders Luciano Leo (himself loosely based on Leonardo) and Pepe were colleagues of Flamengo&#x27;s Carlos Santana and São Paulo&#x27;s Tsubasa Ozora.

== International affiliation ==
In 2017, Kashima established a base in New York where the club main objective is to investigate and apply advanced cases from the digital domain of the Major League Soccer while there are also opportunities to gather information in terms of player management and competition factors. Another reason comes in the form of establishing relationships to learn international strategy directly from the likes of FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The relationship building hasn&#x27;t solely been with European clubs, and for the past two years regular meetings have been held at the head offices of MLS in order to deepen ties with the league and its clubs.

=== Kit evolution ===


== Home stadium ==

Kashima Soccer Stadium has been the home ground of Kashima since 26 March 1993. The Kashima Soccer Museum, opened in 2004 is set for wide-scale renewal, while the Wellness Plaza, established in 2006, is also in line for similar improvements, including the installation of a public bath. There is a real awareness of furthering stadium use on non-matchdays to ensure Kashima Stadium is a hub for the local region.
On the other hand, the importance of Kashima Stadium as a sacred football ground will also increase. The stadium has been selected as a host venue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, meaning it will international competition for the first time since the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Ahead of that, the stadium will also host the Ibaraki National Sports Festival this year, at which athletes will gather from all over the country.

In 2008 a 500-metre LED wraparound advertising board, the longest in Asia, was installed at the front of the second tier. In 2017, the latest large electronic screens were added to both the north and south stands as part of the commitment to improving the viewing environment for visitors.

<doc id="1168079" wikidata="Q3008317" url="?curid=1168079" title="Deryni novels">
<text>The Deryni novels are a series of historical fantasy novels by the American author Katherine Kurtz.

The first novel in the series to be published was &quot;Deryni Rising&quot; in 1970, and the most recent, &quot;The King&#x27;s Deryni&quot;, was published in 2014. As of 2016, the series consists of five trilogies, one stand-alone novel, various short stories, and two reference books.

Most of the series is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms (portions of &quot;King Kelson&#x27;s Bride&quot; take place in the rival kingdom of Torenth). Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom that roughly parallels 10th, 11th, or 12th-century England, Scotland, and Wales with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of the Eleven Kingdoms includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic or magical abilities. Throughout the course of the series, relations between humans and Deryni result in ongoing political and religious strife that is often interconnected with the individual lives of the main characters.

While the plots of the novels often involve political, ecclesiastical, and military conflicts on a grand scale, they are counterbalanced by details of the characters&#x27; personal lives. Neither race is depicted as inherently &quot;good&quot; nor &quot;evil&quot;, as both humans and Deryni are depicted as protagonists and antagonists at various points of the series. Additionally, the novels often depict the characters engaging in various forms of magic, and such scenes vary in importance from minor events to significant plot points.

==Novels==

The five Deryni trilogies were published in an order which does not match the internal literary chronology of the series. The first four trilogies alternated between the 12th and 10th centuries, while the fifth trilogy is set immediately prior to the events of the first trilogy. The stand-alone novel, &quot;King Kelson&#x27;s Bride&quot;, takes place after the third trilogy. The trilogies are briefly listed by publication date and historical order below, with a more detailed listing after.

<text>Larry Grayson (31 August 1923 – 7 January 1995), born William Sulley White, was an English comedian and television presenter. He hosted the BBC&#x27;s Saturday-night peak-time TV game show &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s, employing his high-camp, English music hall humour.

His camp stand-up act consisted mainly of anecdotes about a cast of imaginary friends including Everard, Apricot Lil and Slack Alice. A museum in his home town Nuneaton documents his life and work, and a memorial has been established.

==Biography==
Grayson was born William Sulley White in Banbury, Oxfordshire, in 1923. His parents were unmarried and he never met his father. When Grayson was ten days old, his mother, Ethel White, arranged for him to be fostered by Alice and Jim Hammonds in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. He had two foster sisters, Flo and Mary. His foster mother Alice died when he was six years old, and he was brought up by his elder foster sister, Flo, with whom he lived for much of his life. It has been reported that his birth mother stayed in touch with the family and was known to Grayson as &quot;Aunt Ethel&quot;, until he discovered her true identity when he was eight years old. Larry was never formally adopted.

Grayson&#x27;s sexuality was the subject of much speculation, and while he never publicly came out as gay his unpublished memoirs do discuss his sexuality. He recounted how his &quot;one true love&quot; had been his best friend from school days, Tom Proctor, who was killed at the age of 21 at the Battle of Monte Cassino during the Second World War. Grayson said that he never got over this loss, and he is not known to have had any other significant relationships (albeit one biographer recalls there was &quot;a brief smokescreen&quot; when he was said to be engaged to &quot;Crossroads&quot; actress Noele Gordon).

Homosexual acts between men were illegal in England and Wales until the 1967 Sexual Offences Act (when Grayson was 44), and even after that, coming out as gay would have damaged his television career. During his life Grayson was targeted by gay rights campaigners – who picketed his shows calling for him to be open about his sexuality, while the Gay Liberation Front also protested against his stereotypical camp portrayals of gay men for comedic purposes. Grayson&#x27;s biographer, Tony Nicholson, observes that &quot;many gay people acknowledge how important his contribution to camp culture was, and how his mass popularity did perhaps help spearhead greater acceptance of the LGBT community.&quot;

==Early career==
Grayson left school at the age of 14 and began working professionally as a supporting drag act on the comedy club circuit. He initially used the stage name Billy Breen, but changed it to Larry Grayson in the 1950s on the advice of his agent. While the origin of the name Larry is unknown, his management at the time felt a two-syllable first name would be more memorable and go better with the surname Grayson.

Over the next 30 years he toured the UK in male revues and drag shows, as well as in variety shows at venues including working men&#x27;s clubs, regional theatres and the Metropolitan in London. He also added stand-up comedy to his act and developed a gentle anecdotal style of comedy. It was usually based around his various imaginary friends such as Everard, Apricot Lil, Slack Alice, milkman Sterilised Stan, window cleaner Peek-a-boo Pete with his dirty chamois and the postman Pop-It-In Pete. A lot of his material was observational. In his early years, Grayson&#x27;s family had the only telephone in the street, and his inspiration came from overhearing his neighbours using it. The &quot;imaginary friends&quot; were in fact based on local characters: for example, Apricot Lil worked at the local jam factory.

While he performed as Billy Breen at the New Pavilion Theatre Redcar (now the Regent Cinema) he first used what became his familiar catchphrase &quot;shut that door&quot; when a side door had been left open causing a cold breeze to blow across the stage straight from the sea. During this period, Grayson was briefly managed by Eve Taylor, who renamed him Larry Grayson and is credited with being the source of the phrase, as several of her clients revealed that whenever she wanted to discuss money or personal issues with her clients she would always tell them to &quot;shut that door&quot;. Taylor struggled to find him the right opportunities and they parted, with Grayson becoming a client of Michael Grade.

==Television career==
An early TV appearance in the 1950s had led to complaints about his act being too outrageous, and Grayson had resigned himself to a career off television. Then in the early 1970s his club act was seen by Michael Grade, then an agent, who signed him.
Following several successful appearances in ATV variety shows, Grade&#x27;s uncle, impresario Lew Grade, gave Grayson a contract to front a show, &quot;Shut That Door!&quot; (1972), and slightly later, the &quot;Larry Grayson Show&quot;.

In 1974 he released the single &quot;Just Another Pretty Face&quot; on Pye Records.

Grayson also made two cameo appearances in the Midlands-based soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;, as a flouncing, difficult customer at the Crossroads Motel and as the chauffeur at the wedding of Meg Richardson, played by his close friend Noele Gordon. In real life Grayson could not drive. He also made a number of guest appearances in variety shows, chat shows and panel games.

===&quot;The Generation Game&quot;===
Grayson&#x27;s popularity peaked when he was hired by the BBC to present the Saturday night show &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in 1978, as the replacement for Bruce Forsyth. The show was successful, once attracting an audience of 25 million (due to a strike at ITV) at its peak. Grayson was assisted by his co-star Isla St Clair, whom he frequently referred to as &quot;my lovely Isla&quot;.

Despite its popularity, by 1981 &quot;The Generation Game&quot; was being overtaken in the ratings by ITV&#x27;s rival show &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;. Grayson decided to leave &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in 1982 while it was still relatively successful, in the expectation that the BBC would offer him another high-profile Saturday night show; this did not materialise.

==Later life==
Grayson went into unintentional semi-retirement, living alone at his house in Nuneaton with his pet dogs, although he did return to television to present the game show &quot;Sweethearts&quot; for ITV in 1987. He made a number of other TV appearances and radio broadcasts, including the Tom O&#x27;Connor-hosted TV quiz show &quot;A Question of Entertainment&quot;, where he was one of the team captains in 1988. Grayson moved with his adoptive older sister Flo to Torquay, Devon, where they lived in separate neighbouring bungalows, during his semi-retirement, but moved back to Nuneaton after a couple of years when he became bored and missed his close family and friends.

==Death==
Grayson&#x27;s final public appearance was on 3 December 1994 at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;. During this performance he referred to his hiatus from television by commenting to the audience, &quot;They thought I was dead!&quot;. Appropriately, his last words to the audience were his catchphrase, &quot;Shut that door&quot;.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994, Grayson was rushed into hospital with a perforated appendix. He was discharged from hospital, but died on 7 January 1995 in Nuneaton, at the age of 71. He was buried alongside other members of his family at Oaston Road Cemetery in his home town of Nuneaton.

===Obituaries===
Journalist Suzi Pritchard wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

Ken Dodd, a fellow comedian, said of Grayson:
==In popular culture==

<doc id="1168092" wikidata="Q443109" url="?curid=1168092" title="Katherine Kurtz">
<text>Katherine Irene Kurtz (born October 18, 1944) is an American fantasy writer, author of sixteen historical fantasy novels in the &quot;Deryni&quot; series, as well as occult and urban fantasy. Resident in Ireland for over twenty years, she moved to Virginia in 2007.

==Early life and education==
Kurtz was born on October 18, 1944, in Coral Gables, Florida, where she also grew up. She secured a scholarship to study chemistry and graduated with a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Miami, later attending medical school for a year and taking an M.A. in Medieval History at UCLA. While pursuing her Masters, she worked for the Los Angeles Police Academy and began writing her first novels. She also worked in oceanography and television.

==Career==
Kurtz is best known for the Deryni novels and short stories. Her 1970 debut novel, &quot;Deryni Rising&quot;, was one of the first fantasy novels written in a mode closer to historical fiction than to mythology or legend, as was common in the then-popular high fantasy works such as those by J. R. R. Tolkien. Writing in &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;, Kari Sperring calls Kurtz the &quot;first writer of secondary-world historical fantasy&quot;, noting her close attention to the importance of faith in pre-modern Western societies and her portrayal of magic as a formal, ritual practice as opposed to the &quot;picaresque and informal&quot; way magic was depicted in other fantasy of the time.

She also wrote several occult alternate history novels in her &quot;Templar&quot; series, and urban fantasy novels in her &quot;Adept&quot; series.

Kurtz has a weekly chat with her fan base about her writing, life, cats, and many other subjects.

==Personal life==
Kurtz married Scott MacMillan in 1983; they have one son. Within the following couple of years they moved to Ireland. Both later became naturalized Irish citizens. Until 2007, they lived at Holybrooke (Hollybrook) Hall, in the largest of four houses formed from the original historic building, between Kilmacanogue and Bray in County Wicklow, Ireland. Kurtz wrote, and Macmillan, who had worked in the film industry, took a role as a herald in the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. They put their Irish home on the market in 2006 for 3.5 million euro, and in 2007 moved back to the United States, to a historic house in Virginia.

==Partial bibliography==

<doc id="1168100" wikidata="Q7874247" url="?curid=1168100" title="USS Sonoma (1862)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Sonoma&quot; was a sidewheel gunboat that served in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for Sonoma Creek in northern California, Sonoma County, California, and the town of Sonoma, California, that in turn were named for one of the chiefs of the Chocuyen Indians of that region.

&quot;Sonoma&quot; was launched by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 15 April 1862; sponsored by Miss Mary N. Bleecker; and commissioned on 8 July 1862, Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr. in command.

==Service history==

===1862–1863===
On 17 July 1862, the double-ender sailed for the West Indies for operations against Confederate blockade runners and raiders on the high seas. The success of Confederate cruisers, especially and , in operations against Union shipping prompted the Department of the Navy on 8 September 1862 to put Commodore Charles Wilkes in command of a &quot;flying&quot; West India Squadron created specifically to seek out and destroy the Confederate raiders. &quot;Sonoma&quot; was assigned to this squadron. While &quot;Sonoma&quot; never engaged &quot;Florida&quot; or &quot;Alabama&quot;, she did operate successfully against blockade runners.

On 5 October 1862, &quot;Sonoma&quot; chased &quot;Harriet Pinckney&quot; back into port after she had attempted to slip out of Bermuda reportedly carrying &quot;infernal machines or torpedoes ... for destroying ships in harbor.&quot; On 18 January 1863, &quot;Sonoma&quot; and the sloop-of-war seized &quot;Virginia&quot; off Mugeres Island, Mexico, and sent the steamer to Key West, Florida, for adjudication. 

On 3 February 1863, &quot;Sonoma&quot; captured the British bark &quot;Springbok&quot;. On 15 February 1863, she took the brig &quot;Atlantic&quot; bound from Havana, Cuba, for Matamoros, Mexico. Finally, on 14 April 1863, she took the schooner &quot;Clyde&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico after &quot;Clyde&quot; had escaped from the Confederacy laden with cotton and rosin.

The wear and tear of hard service at sea was catching up with &quot;Sonoma&quot;, and she sailed north for repairs. The ship reached New York City on 13 June 1863 and was decommissioned on 20 June 1863.

===1863–1865===
With repairs completed, &quot;Sonoma&quot; was recommissioned on 28 September 1863 and assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in which she served for the rest of the Civil War. Highlights of this service included her capture on 8 July 1864 of &quot;Ida&quot; a sidewheel steamer which had slipped out of Sapelp Sound, Georgia, and was bound for the Bahamas laden with cotton. In December 1864, Sonoma was part of a Union naval force that landed Union Army troops and a battalion of United States Marines at Gregorie Point near Yemassee, South Carolina, in an attempt to cut the rail line between Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina; they were defeated by a significantly smaller Confederate force in the Battle of Tulifinny.

Early in 1865, &quot;Sonoma&quot; participated in operations of the squadron clearing the way for General William Tecumseh Sherman in his march north from Savannah. On 9 February 1865, &quot;Sonoma&quot;, the sloop-of-war , and the sidewheel steamer engaged Confederate batteries at Togodo Creek, near North Edisto, South Carolina. &quot;Sonoma&quot; was hit twice in the action, but she silenced the Confederate guns. On the same day, Sherman was marching on nearby Orangeburg, South Carolina, which he took on 12 February 1865. Assurance of Union naval control of the waters in its path enabled Sherman&#x27;s army to travel fast and light and helped to shorten the war.

On 16 and 17 February 1865, &quot;Sonoma&quot; joined in the naval support of the Union Army″s attack on Bull&#x27;s Bay, South Carolina, a diversionary movement in the major drive on Charleston. A boat party from the ship helped in the fighting ashore.

The tempo of &quot;Sonoma&quot;″s activity eased somewhat as Sherman moved north close to territory whose waters were within the jurisdiction of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, but she and her sister ships remained as visible evidence of Union power. After the Confederacy collapsed in April 1865, the ship sailed north and was decommissioned at New York City on 13 June 1865. She was sold there on 1 October 1867.

<doc id="1168102" wikidata="Q1993801" url="?curid=1168102" title="Nissan Pulsar">
<text>The is a line of automobiles produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan from 1978 until 2000, when it was replaced by the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy in the Japanese market.

Between 2000 and 2005, the name &quot;Pulsar&quot; has been used in Australia and New Zealand on rebadged versions of the Sylphy. This arrangement continued until the introduction of the Nissan Tiida (C11) in 2005; at this time the Pulsar name was retired. In 2013, Nissan replaced the Tiida in Australia and New Zealand with two new models badged as Pulsar. These were based on the Sylphy (B17) sedan and Tiida (C12) hatchback, the latter also sold in Thailand under the Pulsar name. In 2014, a European-only replacement for the Tiida was introduced using the Pulsar nameplate.

The original Pulsar was a hatchback to be sold exclusively at a different Nissan Japan dealership network called &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; as a larger five-door hatchback alternative to the Nissan Cherry. Although Pulsar models were front-wheel drive from introduction, Nissan did offer four-wheel drive as an option on select models internationally.

The Pulsar sold in Japan originally served as the intermediate model offered at Nissan dealerships &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; between the Nissan Violet and the Cherry, while different versions of the Pulsar sold at other Japanese networks served as the base model, with other larger Nissan products. Various Pulsar-based models were exported as international market conditions dictated, sometimes labeled as &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot; or &quot;Sentra&quot;, while the internationally labeled product was actually a Pulsar and not a Japanese market Sunny or Cherry.

The name &quot;Pulsar&quot; is taken from pulsar (portmanteau of pulsating star), a highly magnetized, rotating neutron star.
&#x27;
== N10, N11 (1978) ==
The N10 model Pulsar, introduced in May 1978, replaced the earlier Cherry F-II internationally, and benefited from the engineering efforts of the Prince Motor Company which developed the Nissan Cherry before the company merged with Nissan in 1966. It retained the rack-and-pinion steering of the Cherry, as well as the independent suspension with coilover struts in front and coil sprung trailing arms at the rear. The Pulsar was a subcompact car to augment the Sunny sedan. The Sunny and the Pulsar ranges were sold at different Nissan Japan dealerships, called &quot;Nissan Satio Shop&quot; for the Sunny, and &quot;Nissan Cherry Shop&quot; for the Pulsar.

It retained the Cherry name in Europe and many other export markets, even being sold as the &quot;Cherry Europe&quot; in some markets such as Belgium to separate it from the Cherry F-II which remained on sale for a while. The &quot;Cherry&quot;-badged version was first introduced at the Dutch AutoRAI show in February 1979 and went on sale shortly thereafter. An unusual styling feature for the car was its long nose, which was due to Nissan envisaging that the car would also be built with a longitudinal rear-wheel-drive layout for developing markets; however, only front-wheel-drive models were actually built. At the time of introduction, the Pulsar only had a four-door fastback-styled sedan bodywork, and either a 1.2- or a 1.4-liter engine. The three-door and coupé hatchbacks arrived in September 1978. Many export markets also offered a 1.0-liter (A10) option, with while the 1.2-liter A12 offered . This was the first passenger car Nissan assembled in their new Greek plant, where local partner TEOKAR built it with the 1.0 and 1.2-liter engines from 1980 on.


This model was known as the Datsun Cherry or Datsun 100A/120A/130A/140A/150A in Europe and most of Asia, and the Datsun 310 in the US and Canada. It was exported to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Malaysia with the Datsun Pulsar name. It entered the Australian market in October 1980, with the facelift arriving in October 1981. In New Zealand the facelift model was locally assembled from late 1981, effectively replacing the previous generation 100A which was built and sold locally in the mid-1970s. The Datsun Pulsar was also locally assembled in South Africa and in Malaysia by Tan Chong Motor. Some late South African Pulsars use the square Skyline-style head- and taillights from the Langley, including on the well-equipped Pulsar Panache model.

Another Pulsar derivative was introduced to Japan, called the Nissan Langley, from 1980, and was introduced as a &quot;mini Skyline&quot;, and exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Shop&quot;. The Japanese-market Langley assumed duties of the first generation, Sunny-based coupe called the Nissan Silvia when the second generation Silvia was upgraded to the larger Nissan Violet platform; both the Silvia and the Langley remained exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations. The Langley was given its name from Samuel Pierpont Langley the inventor of the bolometer, a device used to measure electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, and was well regarded for his work in solar physics. Because of its sporting intentions, the Langley was equipped with an independent suspension at all four wheels, using MacPherson struts in the front, and a trailing arm coil suspension for the rear. The engine choices consisted of the A14 and E15 series engines with multi-point fuel injection on top level trim packages, but only in a three-door hatchback.

The N10 series Pulsar was available as a three- or five-door hatchback, a short-lived four-door fastback sedan, a five-door van or station wagon, and a three-door fastback-styled coupé with a wraparound rear window introduced at the end of 1978. The van was first released in November 1978, while the export-only wagon models first appeared in early 1979. Originally the lineup consisted only of the four-door sedan which utilized the same body profile as the later hatchback models; in August 1978 the coupé and three-door hatchback models were added, along with a fuel injected version of the 1.4-liter engine. One year later a five-door hatchback appeared, replacing the four-door sedan which was immediately discontinued.Most markets outside Japan did not receive all versions: for instance, the three- and five-door hatchbacks and the coupé were the only models to be offered in the US. Most markets never got any fuel injected versions. The 1.0-liter &quot;A10&quot; (later also updated to an OHC engine, called E10) was never available in Japan, mainly restricted to markets where tax codes made smaller engines necessary. An interesting anomaly of the French automotive taxation system is that while the A12A-engined Cherry sedans were considered as &quot;6 CVs&quot;, the coupés with the same engine were markedly cheaper to own as they were classified as &quot;5 CVs&quot;. An unusual feature at the time of introduction was the split folding rear seat fitted to better equipped models, increasing versatility.

A late-term facelift in March 1981 brought Nissan&#x27;s newly developed OHC E-series engines in for the last twelve months of production, which also introduced the more conventional (and industry standard) drivetrain with an end-on transmission with unequal length driveshafts - the A-Series engine cars continued to use the transmission-in-sump layout that had been used in the previous generation Cherry models. The facelift involved a new grille and rectangular headlamps. The updated 1982 model Pulsar five-door hatchback with E-series engine was assembled in New Zealand at Nissan&#x27;s new factory-owned assembly plant in Wiri, Auckland. Only one well-equipped model was offered, with a five-speed manual gearbox.

In 1982 &quot;Nissan&quot; badges began to appear on the cars, due to Nissan phasing out the Datsun name at that time for its international markets. Production of the N10 series ceased in mid-1982, to be replaced by the all-new N12 Cherry/Pulsar.

In Japan the five-door van received the VN10 chassis code when shown in November 1978, but was then re-released in August 1979 in a version which met the 1979 commercial vehicle emissions standards — this model was designated VN11. While domestic market passenger models only received the slightly larger A12A engine, the vans and many export markets retained the smaller A12 engine (and the option of the larger A14) as also used in the preceding Cherry F-II. The van was unusual in the Japanese market for the period in being front-wheel drive; Nissan made the most of this and gave it a special rear suspension to allow for a very low loading floor. To further lower the rear opening the rear bumper was also extremely slim. This generation Pulsar van also provided the basis for the first generation of the Prairie people carrier. This van bodywork, with more comfortable fittings, was also used for the wagon model as sold in export markets. After the March 1981 facelift, the van also received the updated E13 and E15 OHC engines and now carried the VUN10 and VMN10 chassis codes. The three-door panel van model seems to have only been sold in the export.

=== Datsun 310 ===
In North America the N10 Pulsar was originally sold only with the largest, 1.4-liter engine and only with four- or five-speed manual transmissions. Called the Datsun 310, in Canada it was also available with Pulsar striping on the rear quarters. Equipment levels were Deluxe or GX, and originally only the three-door hatchback or hatchback coupé bodywork were available. Only the three-door (called a &quot;two-door sedan hatchback&quot; in period materials) was ever available in Deluxe trim, with the GX being optional and all other bodystyles only sold in GX trim. A four-speed manual was installed in all sedans, while the GX Coupé received a five-speed unit. The three-door GX was unusual in receiving manual, remotely controlled (from the center console, behind the parking brake) rear side windows. A five-door hatchback (&quot;sedan hatchback&quot;) model was added to the line during the 1980 model year, only in GX trim.

For 1981 the Pulsar received a facelift in North America, with a sloping, horizontal bar grille and rectangular headlights in place of the previous round units. A larger 1.5-liter engine replaced the earlier 1.4-liter unit, although in desmogged form it only produced . This was still a pushrod unit (unlike the new E-series which was on its way into the Pulsar in the rest of the world), with a two-barrel carburetor and a catalytic converter. The 310 never stood a great chance in North America, where the cheaper and somewhat larger rear-wheel-drive 210-series always outsold it. The lack of an automatic option was a further hindrance in the US market.
== N12 (1982) ==
A more angular version was announced in April 1982, making its European debut in October. By this time, Nissan had more or less standardised its naming policy worldwide, so as a Nissan it tended, except in European markets, to be known as the Pulsar. In Europe it retained the &quot;Cherry&quot; moniker, and in Malaysia and South Africa it was sold as the Nissan Langley. This generation Pulsar hatchback, three-door and five-door, was sold in North America only for model year 1983. Some unusual options were carried over from the previous generation, such as having the rear locks (on four-door models) remote operated by cable from the front seat. The rear child locks could also be controlled with a slider mounted beneath the driver&#x27;s seat.

;Asia
New Pulsar models were introduced in the Japanese home market with three- or five-door hatchback bodywork, as well as the Pulsar EXA two-door coupé. In June a four-door sedan arrived as well. Most Pulsars sold had flush-fitting, aerodynamic rectangular headlights, but the lowest-spec cars received smaller rectangular units set deeper within the grille surround. There was no van model of the N12 Pulsar; instead, Nissan Cherry stores sold a version of the B11-series AD Van as the &quot;Pulsar AD.&quot; In May 1983 the 1.7-liter CD17 diesel and a turbocharged petrol model were introduced. At the same time, a door mirror was fitted to some models rather than the traditional fender-mounted unit. The law had been changed only two months earlier, allowing for such fitment, and the Pulsar was the first Japanese car to take advantage of the change. The lowest-spec models, like the Pulsar TC, continued to use fender mirrors until the end of N12 production.

The series was facelifted at the end of March 1984, with wider and slimmer headlights. There were no longer two types of headlamps available. This is also when the Pulsar Milano trim level was introduced. This was a three-door hatchback with a more European and Italianate flair - while Alfa Romeo were not involved in its development, calling the model by the name of Alfa Romeo&#x27;s hometown was a nod at the collaboration. In May 1985 the turbocharger was changed to a water-cooled design.

The Nissan Langley, in its second generation, was a Pulsar sold at &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations next to the Skyline, and shared many styling influences from the Skyline. The market acceptance of the Langley inspired Nissan to sell a second badge engineered version at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; as the Nissan Liberta Villa. This model partially replaced the larger Nissan Stanza clone called the Nissan Violet Liberta. The Liberta Villa was only available as a sedan, offered as a smaller companion to the Nissan Leopard (itself a Skyline clone). The top trim package was the SSS turbo with the &quot;E15ET&quot; engine, and the top two trim packages offered multi-port fuel injection with the base model offering a carburetor—all with the 1.5-liter petrol engine. As with the Pulsar and the Langley, the &quot;CD17&quot; diesel engine was also offered on the Liberta Villa.

In Singapore the Pulsar was clearly defined as a class below the Sunny (even though a Pulsar sedan is longer than a Sunny and sits on a longer wheelbase). While the Sunny could be had with 1.3 or 1.5-liter engines, the Pulsar was only available with the 1-litre E10 engine. It was also fitted with the small recessed lights used for the lowest-cost models. In Singaporean specifications, the E10 engine produces DIN and was also available together with air conditioning.

;Australasia
The Australian market Pulsar N12 series arrived in October 1982. Offered as a five-door hatchback, 1.3-liter TC and 1.5-liter TS specifications featured. These early cars were manufactured in Japan. May 1983 saw the debut of an update to the Australian range. Now produced locally, the update heralded minor trim changes, suspension and steering revisions and new seats. Specification levels were overhauled with the Pulsar E opening up the range with its 1.3-liter engine, followed by the 1.5-liter GL and GX. In October 1983 the sedan body was introduced in GL and GX guises (1.5-liter). A turbocharged Pulsar ET five-door arrived in April 1984, sharing its engine and trim with the EXA. It was only available with a five-speed manual. The ET also had alloy wheels, a modified suspension and various aerodynamic improvements. The engine was imported fully built from Japan, which placed a limit on how many ETs could be built without falling afoul of laws on local content.

The next update came in August 1984 alongside a badge engineered twin, the Holden Astra (LB)—a scheme devised under the Button car plan. To differentiate the Pulsar, Nissan Australia applied the upmarket Japanese market Langley body details for its facelift. The headlamps were now fitted as quad units and narrower horizontal tail lamps distinguished the rear styling. Other changes included an increase in specification, minor suspension calibrations, and refreshed interior trims. Sedan versions had their facelift delayed until November that year, and the ET hatchback lingered on with the older styling until the demise of the N12 in 1987. The Australian-built Pulsar ET was also exported to New Zealand, beginning in 1985.

The final Australian N12 update arrived in April 1986 prior to the 1987 N13 introduction. The Holden version was known as the LC Astra. The revisions brought further trim changes, tweaks to the five-speed manual transmission, new colours, a new entry-level DX model, a change from GX to GXE, and the introduction of a larger displacement 1.6-liter engine tuned for unleaded petrol replacing the 1.3- and 1.5-liter leaded units used previously. The ET model also saw its 1.5-liter turbocharged engine updated for unleaded fuel.

The N12 was assembled in New Zealand at Nissan NZ&#x27;s plant in Wiri South Auckland from 1982, and facelifted in 1984 when the main change was a switch to the now compulsory laminated windscreen. This generation was offered in both three and five door hatchback form with both 1.3- and 1.5-liter Nissan E-series engines shared with the also locally assembled Sunny sedan (NZ did not import the equivalent Pulsar sedan). The Holden Astra badged variant was not sold in New Zealand. The EXA Coupé was a limited official Nissan import new but thousands more Japanese market specification models arrived in the later 1980s and early 1990s when the NZ market was opened up to used imports.

;Europe

The European market Cherrys were available with engines ranging from a 1.0-liter, petrol unit via a 1270 cc 60 PS, a 1488 cc 70 PS up to the turbocharged 1.5-liter &quot;E15ET&quot; and also included the diesel &quot;CD17&quot;. In early 1983, a 1.7-liter diesel option was introduced; this was the first Cherry diesel. Only a small &quot;diesel&quot; badge on the bootlid betrayed the engine option. To accommodate the extra over the front axle, the diesel received stronger front springs and a model-specific, slightly larger, single-spoke steering wheel to counteract what would have otherwise been a heavier steering.

The Cherry Turbo was an attempt at breaking into the then very popular GTi category, but being a somewhat half-hearted effort it did not have much of an impact in the marketplace. The Turbo sat on comparatively skinny Dunlop tires and had few changes aside from its many stickers and the turbocharger. Period tests complained about peaky power delivery (and the same long gear ratios as for the regular Cherry), torque steer, and a harsh ride. The Pulsar/Cherry underwent a light facelift in July 1984.

This model was also built in Italy by Alfa Romeo as the Arna (named after the joint venture which created it, Alfa Romeo Nissan Autoveicoli), using Alfa Romeo boxer engines. Confusingly, the Italian models were also sold in the United Kingdom and Spain as the &quot;Nissan Cherry Europe&quot;. At Alfa Romeo, the Arna was meant to replace lesser versions of the popular Alfasud, but never had the Italian car&#x27;s appeal. The Cherry Europe also failed in its &quot;home&quot; market (Europe) lacking the build quality and reliability of its Japanese built twin car.


== N13 (1986) ==


In 1986, Nissan&#x27;s design chief refused to follow the smoother, aerodynamic look of other cars, and told his design team to come up with an affordable, subcompact car. A squarer Pulsar N13 series was released as a result; innovations included a permanently four-wheel drive model with a viscous coupling which appeared in May 1986. In February 1987 a version with three viscous couplings was introduced: one for each axle and one in between. This was originally limited to a production of 200 cars, at a price increase 50 percent higher than for the regular four-wheel-drive version. For 1988 it became a regularly available model; this was very similar to the Attesa system which first appeared in the Bluebird soon thereafter. In 1986, the Pulsar won the Car of the Year Japan award. Capitalizing on the popularity of the larger R31 series Nissan Skyline, this generation shares many visual styling cues with the larger car.

The N13 series EXA was spun off as its own model internationally, but retained the Pulsar NX name in the United States. It was designated as the N13 series, despite actually being based on the Nissan Sunny (B12) chassis.

===Asia===
The Pulsar was sold in Japan as a three- and five-door hatchback, plus a four-door sedan. There was no turbocharged version of the N13 Pulsar, with Nissan choosing to focus on multivalve engines instead. In April 1988, the 1.5-litre engines were changed to the new GA generation.

The Langley and the Liberta Villa (both sold as sedans and three-door hatchbacks) also continued sales in Japan as upmarket versions of the Pulsar, with a limited engine lineup. Both the Langley and Liberta Villa had slightly different bodywork to the Japanese-specification Pulsar—although most parts were interchangeable. Langley and Liberta Villa three-doors sported completely redesigned rear-ends, which were slightly longer and tapered off in a notchback-like manner and were much sportier in appearance with their more steeply raked rear windows. The sedans featured reshaped upper doors (windows), rear windshields, rear quarter panels, and are noted for the repositioning of the license plate to the rear bumper from the boot lid. The Langley and Liberta Villa were themselves differentiated by their own frontal styling. Compared to the Pulsar, the Langley had narrower trapezoidal-shaped headlamps and a unique grille—whereas the Liberta Villa had narrow rectangular-shaped lights and again its own grille design. The N13 Langley and Liberta Villa featured other options such as a limited-slip differential, luxurious interior and the much sought-after black headlights on the Langley, centre grille and round Skyline-style taillights, with the equipment shared in the Liberta Villa. The Japanese-market Langley five-door hatchback was dropped with the N13.

In Malaysia, the N13 Pulsar was sold as the Nissan Sentra, which was introduced in 1987 to replace the slow selling B12 Sentra. From mid-1989 it became available with the 12-valve GA16S engine, in a model called the SLX Super-valve.


===Oceania===
The Pulsar–Astra relationship continued in Australia, with the series there continuing to use the more upmarket Langley sedan as the donor vehicle. The sedan version was called the Pulsar Vector. The five-door hatchback was also offered, but this model differed from the Japanese Pulsar with reshaped upper doors (windows) and rear quarter panels. The development of the model was a collaboration with Holden, using the Family II engine built in Australia. Nissan introduced a facelift in 1989. After Holden ended their cooperation with Nissan in 1989 (and took up with Toyota instead), sales of the Holden Astra came to an end. Nissan Australia, however, kept using the GM engines until the succeeding N14 version was introduced.

four-cylinder engines offered in the Australian built version were:

In New Zealand, the previous Sunny and Pulsar ranges were replaced by a single model line now called the Nissan Sentra—which were based on the Japanese market Pulsar and again mostly locally assembled, all with Japanese-manufactured Nissan engines. Versions in New Zealand were available in four body shapes; three-door hatchback (SG, SR), five-door hatchback (SGS, ZXE), four-door sedan (SG, SGS, ZXE), and a five-door &quot;Sportwagon&quot; (SG, SGS).

Six engines were offered over this generation:
* 1.3 – SG – 1985–1989 – E13
* 1.4 – SG/SGS – 1989–1991 – GA14S (59 kW (79 hp) at 6,200 rpm, at 4,000 rpm)
* 1.6 – ZXE – 1985–1989 – E16
* 1.6 – ZXE – 1989–1991 – GA16S (69 kW (92 hp) at 6,000 rpm, at 3,200 rpm)
* 1.6 – SR twin cam – CA16DE
* 1.8 – GTI – CA18DE

===Europe===
In Europe, the N13 Pulsar was usually sold under the Nissan Sunny name - however, this was not the same car as the Nissan Sunny (B12) sold elsewhere around the same time. In Greece the N13 Pulsar retained the Cherry nameplate. Some markets (such as Greece) received a lineup starting with a 1.0-liter engine, but in most countries the 1.3 was at the bottom of the lineup. A carburetted 1.6 was also on offer (fuel injected and catalysed in some countries), as was the 1.7-liter diesel engine. Equipment levels for the non-sporting models were L, LX, SLX and SGX. Four-wheel-drive was also available in the sedan. While the Pulsar was generally sold with Sunny badging in Europe, the Sunny Wagon (B12) was sold as part of the same Sunny family.

The top version, called the Sunny GTi, initially had the 1.6-litre 16-valve engine with at 6,400 rpm in the catalysed version. The version sold in countries unencumbered by emissions regulations produces at 6,600 rpm. The GTi was quite discreet, with external changes limited to side skirts and small spoilers front and rear, as well as alloy wheels. When introduced, it was not a particularly strong contender in the GTi market; to rectify this Nissan later introduced a more powerful and torquier 1.8-litre version.

== N14 (1990) ==
In 1990, the N14 model saw Nissan turn to a more rounded design. The Langley and the Liberta Villa were replaced with the Nissan Primera, assigning the Primera to &quot;Nissan Prince Shop&quot; locations.

This version of the car was launched in the United Kingdom as the Nissan Sunny from March 1991 and was the last generation of Sunny to be sold in Europe, where it was replaced late in 1995 by the Almera. One anomaly from this period resulted from Nissan taking control of its British import and distribution business from Automotive Financial Group (AFG); the acrimonious split between Nissan and Octav Botnar resulted in AFG sourcing the vehicle badged as the Pulsar and selling it concurrently in the UK alongside the &quot;official&quot; version (badged as the Sunny) by the newly established Nissan Motor GB. The European top-of-the-line model was the 2.0 GTI, equipped with the naturally aspirated SR20DE engine with rather than the 1.8-litre version used in the home market. While powerful, the Sunny GTI was better equipped and more cosseting than its in-class competitors, with more sedate handling as well.

This version continued to be offered in CKD kit form in New Zealand as the Sentra (unrelated to the version sold in North America). In Europe, the Sunny name continued, applied to three-door hatchback, five-door hatchback and four-door sedan models, alongside the separate model line Sunny California station wagon from Japan (called either the Sunny Estate or Sunny Traveller). This was the last generation of the Pulsar (now with Sunny badges, as in the rest of Europe) to be assembled in Greece, where TEOKAR went out of business in April 1995.

There was no N14 Pulsar offered in the United States or Canada either. Instead, the North American Pulsar for those markets evolved into what was known as the NX1600. The NX cars are coupés sharing the same chassis, engines, body electronics, and even dashboard with the Pulsar N14.

=== Marketing ===
;Japan
In Japan, the N14 range was large, comprising eight different models with a total of eighteen available variations, including six different engines, three body shapes, and two drivetrains.
* GA13DS , at 6,000 rpm, at 3,600 rpm
* GA15DS , at 6,000 rpm, at 3,600 rpm

* SR20DET , at 6,400 rpm, at 4,800 rpm
* CD17 , at 4,800 rpm, at 2,800 rpm

;Australia
In Australia, the N14 (aka ES) was available in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. Nissan Australia assembled the range that sold from October 1991 to February 1993 at their factory in Clayton South, Victoria. Similar models with unique specifications and Sentra badging were shipped to New Zealand where a wagon version, sourced from Japan and assembled locally, was also offered. After Nissan closed the Clayton South plant in October 1992 for financial reasons, the models (known as the &quot;Series 2&quot;) were imported from Japan and sold in Australia until September 1995, while Nissan NZ imported its own versions in CKD form to sell alongside the locally assembled wagon until the plant in Wiri, South Auckland, shut down in 1998. Unlike the N13 Pulsar/Astra, Holden in Australia did not use a variant of this Pulsar, instead choosing to use a rebadged variant of the rival Toyota Corolla, which they sold as the Holden Nova until the late 1990s when they reintroduced the Astra name for their variant of the Opel Astra. The Pulsar N14 was awarded Australian &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year in 1991, an honor it shared with the Honda NSX.
* GA14DS , at 6,000 rpm, at 4,000 rpm (NZ Only)
* GA16DE , at 6,000 rpm, at 4,000 rpm
* SR20DE , at 6,400 rpm, at 4,800 rpm

;Europe
Sold as the Sunny in the Europe from February 1991, the N14 was fitted with different engines from their Japanese counterparts, to better suit local regulations and markets. The AD Van (Y10) was sold as the Sunny Wagon, with the 1.6-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel engines, with entirely different sheetmetal. Four-wheel-drive was available on the 1.6-liter Wagon and four-door sedan versions as well as the turbocharged GTi-R (introduced in June 1991). With the introduction of stricter, Europe-wide emissions standards (Euro 1) in 1992, the uncatalyzed versions were generally discontinued. The range was lightly facelifted in February 1993, at which time fuel injected versions of the 1.4 and 1.6 were also introduced. The four-wheel-drive versions switched to the fuel injected engine; the 4WD sedan was discontinued in mid-1994.

The N14 Sunny was generally discontinued by September 1995, as the new Almera replaced it. The Y10-based Sunny Traveller/Wagon continued to be on offer in an dwindling number of markets until 2000 since there was no Almera wagon on offer. The Sunny Wagon received light changes in April 1996.

;South Africa
In South Africa the N14 (aka ES) was built locally by Nissan South Africa. It was only available with FWD as a four-door sedan (badged Sentra) and five-door hatchback (badged Sabre). Originally released in 1994 and given a cosmetic facelift in 1997 rather than being replaced with the N15, it was produced until 2000 and was also exported to Namibia.

* 200 GXi – SR20DE – , at 6400 rpm, at 4800 rpm

=== GTI-R ===
The N14 series also saw the introduction of the GTI-R three-door hatchback (sold in Japan as a Pulsar with chassis code E-RNN14, and sold in Europe as a Sunny with chassis code EGNN14). This was a homologation variant produced between 1990 and 1994 in order to enter the WRC under Group A rules. It featured a turbocharged 2.0-litre &quot;SR20DET&quot; engine producing and . The body is largely the same as the standard N14 three-door model, but distinguished by the large rear wing and bonnet scoop. It has an ATTESA all-wheel drive system and a unique variant (coded &quot;54C&quot;) of the &quot;SR20DET&quot; engine. With a power-to-weight ratio of 0.083 weighing and all-wheel-drive, the standard GTI-R is able to accelerate from 0–100 km/h in 5.4 seconds, cover the standing quarter-mile in 13.5 seconds, and reach a (manufacturer claimed) top speed of 232 km/h (144 mph).

==== Models ====
There were several different models of the GTI-R sold to the general public, identifiable by the model number found on the VIN plate located on the firewall in the engine bay.

* GTI-RA: Model number EBYNRVFN14T******* (aka RA / Alpha / Road / Luxury). This was the normal road car, which came standard with air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, and ABS. Roughly halfway through the production (August 1992), Nissan made a range of cosmetic changes to the interior of the RA model (mostly replacing trim that was unique to the GTI-R with trim that was common to other models in the N14 range). Although not advertised or branded as such, they were extensive enough (around 10 items) to be noticeable as a different phase or series, and are defined by chassis numbers RNN14-100000 and above. They were priced at ¥2,270,000.
* GTI-RB: Model number EBYNRRFN14T******* (aka RB / Base / Beta / Rally / Homologation). The homologated model was stripped-down as a base for motorsport use (Group N rallying in particular). It had the luxury trimmings such as air conditioning, power windows, and ABS removed as standard, and the simple interior trim from the base model N14 which reduced the curb weight by to . A close-ratio gearbox was a production model option, some of the RA items could be optioned (such as rear wiper and air conditioning), and many Nismo parts were available at time of order (such as mechanical limited slip differentials and upgraded suspension). Those that were ordered with Nismo parts not suitable for dealer install were sent to Autech for factory installation. 21 Pulsar GTI-R NISMO were built in total. The only external visual difference to the RA is non-colour-coded side mirrors.
* Sunny GTI-R: Model number EBYNL*N14*******. Sunny was the badge used for the European-delivered GTI-R, which has the different chassis number of EGNN14. The engine and mechanicals are the same as the Pulsar GTI-R but the power and torque specifications (220 PS / 162 kW and 267 Nm / 197 lb·ft) are slightly less due to the ECU having different fuel and ignition maps to compensate for the lower octane fuel available in those regions. There was no RB variant offered, but they were available in both LHD and RHD configuration. The only obvious external physical difference to the Pulsar is the rear number plate surround (to accommodate wider European plates). The interior varied from the RA Pulsar with some of the more basic trim from the RB model and different scaling on the gauges.

Other versions:
* Nismo: Nismo offered a &quot;Complete Car&quot; version based on the RB model featuring many of the Nismo rally options (such as suspension, limited slip differentials, roll cage and foot rests), and strengthening plates spot welded to the strut towers. A total of 21 were produced, with an individually numbered Nismo VIN plate on the firewall. At least one was used by Nissan/Nismo as a promotional vehicle, the others were ordered by private buyers. They were priced at ¥3,140,000.
* Group A: The works rally cars were built and used for the WRC by Nissan Motorsports Europe (NME), they were not available to the general public. After the GTI-R program was shut down, the cars were sold to private buyers, predominately in Europe, where some made their way into rallycross events. Tony Bardy regularly competed in UK rallies using one until 2015. Nissan has the 1991 Acropolis rally and the 1992 RAC rally entry vehicles on display at the Nissan Heritage Collection in Japan.

====Production====
The Pulsar GTI-R was manufactured in Japan between August 1990 until November 1994. The Sunny GTI-R was produced from February 1992 until October 1993. The first year of production (1990–1991) was the largest due to Nissan needing to fulfil the FIA Group A regulations at the time (5,000 models total, with 500 of them homologation models) in order to enter the car as a manufacturer in the WRC.

* Pulsar GTI-RA = 13131
* Pulsar GTI-RB = 701
* Pulsar Unknown = 10
* Pulsar GTI-R TOTAL = 13842
* Sunny GTI-R LHD = 668
* Sunny GTI-R RHD = 103
* Sunny GTI-R TOTAL = 771
* GTI-R TOTAL = 14613

====WRC====
=====Group A=====
:After producing the minimum required 5,000 examples (500 of them being homologation models), Nissan entered the GTI-R under Group A rules in the FIA WRC as a factory team (Nissan Motorsport Europe – NME) in 1991 and 1992.
:Based in Milton Keynes, NME only competed in selected rallies during both years (ones they thought had the highest potential for good results), but the initial success expected by Nissan Japan was not forthcoming, and they abandoned the campaign in 1992 after only nine rallies. Factory development stopped there, and the GTI-R never won a WRC Group A rally. The official NME rally cars were driven by Stig Blomqvist, David Llewellin, and Mike Kirkland in the 1991 WRC. For the 1992 season, Blomqvist stayed with the team, and NME also hired François Chatriot and Tommi Makinen.

Nissan redirected funding to Le Mans and the development of the R390, and NME moved their focus to the FWD Sunny GTI in the WRC F2 category (A7 class) where they had success with Alister McRae winning the 1995 BRC. It is generally agreed that the Group A GTI-R campaign failure was due to the combination of the uncompetitive Dunlop tyres, the inefficiency of the top-mounted intercooler when engine power was increased to Group A standards (especially in hot weather), and the political and cultural issues between Nissan Japan and the newly created NME.
:

=====Group N=====
:Nissan/NME did not enter Group N (production) cars in the World Rally Championship, but they helped develop a car for the Nissan Belgium Rally Team with lead driver Grégoire De Mévius. Together with Japanese privateer team Nishiyama Racing driven by Hiroshi Nishiyama, the GTI-R had great success in the Group N Championship (FIA) Cup for Drivers of Production Cars in 1992 taking 1st and 2nd places, clearly demonstrating the GTI-R&#x27;s the ability at production class level.


== N15 (1995) ==
In 1995, the N15 Pulsar was launched as a compact car, rather than subcompact, and sold in Europe as the Nissan Almera. The New Zealand Nissan Sentra changed name to Pulsar after the Nissan assembly plant in Wiri, Auckland closed down in 1998, in favor of imports from Japan. Again, four- and five-door models were offered, with three-door models being available in Europe and Japan only, and not Australia and New Zealand. North American customers did not receive this car, with the Sunny-based Sentra B14 being sold there instead.

The chassis designation &quot;N&quot; series carried over to the Bluebird Sylphy (N16) in 2000 for the Japanese market.

The Australasian versions included the LX, SLX, Q and SSS variants. New Zealand specific versions included the S and SE variant. The SSS model (5-door hatch only) featured the SR20DE engine featuring /179 Nm.

The station wagon continued to be from the Sunny, later spun off in Japan into the Nissan Wingroad.

=== Trim levels ===
;Japan
In Japan, the N15 was available under numerous nameplates, giving Nissan in Japan the opportunity to sell the Pulsar at two different Japanese network dealerships, called &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; that sold the Pulsar, and &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; that sold the Lucino. Hatchback models were badged Pulsar Serie.

Japanese market N15 Pulsar and Lucino models had drivers airbag as standard. Passenger airbag was an option in 1995 and standard from 1996 onwards. Speedometer became digital from 1998.
Tachometer was not present on Pulsar Serie Rezzo, Pulsar CJ-I, CJ-II and Lucino BB models. Air conditioning was standard on almost all models, but could be requested without. Manual adjusting windows were available on Pulsar Serie Rezzo, Pulsar CJ-I, CJ-II and Lucino BB models, otherwise electric windows were standard.
Sunroof was available option on Pulsar Serie X1, Pulsar Serie X1R, Pulsar GTI, Pulsar VZR and Pulsar / Lucino SR-V models (hatch only).
Manual controlled air conditioning controls were standard, climate control was available as option and standard on Pulsar Serie X1R, Pulsar GTI and Pulsar VZ-R.

An Autech Trimmed version of the Pulsar SRV and Lucino SRV known as the &quot;Aero Sport&quot; was also available. Equipped with the standard SR20DE, compression Ratio : 10.0, maximum power 150PS (110KW). Indicative features included the placement of the spare-wheel on the rear boot lid, inclusion of rubber side moldings over the wheel arches, large rear spoiler, extra rubber door protectors, And unique decals on the sides of the car. As a result of shifting the spare-wheel to the boot lid, the number plate had to be relocated in the rear bumper, meaning a bumper was produced specific for this model. Extra features on this model were limited to the additional body kit.

The cars were than striped, seam welded for added rigidity, and Autech body kits including unique Front bumper, Side skirt and Rear wing. Autech interiors including unique pattern interior, Autech labeled clusters, and Finally Autech Sr20DE engines were installed. Which is why they are stamped SR18DE, as this is the original size of the engine from the GTI. The tuned SR20DE found in these cars, were engines that Autech had from producing the P10 Primera Autech, However, due to multiple factors, Primarily stricter emission standards, and also Nissan about to release the SR16VE, it was de-tuned from the original P10 Autech, losing 5HP and 3NM of torque as well as a less aggressive power curve to meet the stricter emission standards.

N1&#x27;s available in Black, White and Red.

CD20 — 2000 cc SOHC CRDi Diesel engine Featured in the European Almera GX. 


== N16 (2000) ==
In Australia and New Zealand, Nissan continued to use the Pulsar name for the N16 series that was labelled Nissan Bluebird Sylphy in Japan.

== B17 (2013) ==
The B17 series Sylphy sedan was marketed as the Nissan Pulsar for the Australian and New Zealand markets from 2013. The model was discontinued in these two markets in April 2017, alongside the L33 Altima with no successor.

== C12 (2013) ==
The C12 Pulsar hatchback was released in 2013 as a rebadged Nissan Tiida for Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. The C12 model was discontinued in Australia and New Zealand in April 2016 alongside the K13 Micra hatchback with no successor. It was also discontinued in Thailand in 2018, while it continues to be marketed in Taiwan as the Nissan Tiida.

== C13 (2014) ==


On 16 May 2014, Nissan revealed the C13 series Pulsar for the European market. Based on the CMF platform, this model does not replace the C12 version, but is a European-only alternative. The C13 Pulsar signifies Nissan&#x27;s reentry into the highly competitive compact hatchback segment, following the withdrawal of the Tiida from the market in 2011. It marks the first time the Pulsar nameplate has officially been used in mainland Europe, rather than the Cherry, Sunny and Almera nameplates that have been used in Europe over the generations. European sales began in March 2015. Pulsars for sale in Europe were built at Nissan&#x27;s Barcelona plant in Spain.

Initially, the C13 Pulsar was available with a 1.2-liter DiG-T petrol engine with CVT transmission or a 1.5-liter diesel unit producing . In October 2014, Nissan introduced the 1.6-liter DIG-T which develops and went on sale since March 2015.

The model was marketed in Russia since March 2015 as the Nissan Tiida, where it was assembled in Izhevsk from January 2015, but production only lasted until December of the same year due to low sales. It is also sold in China as the C13 series Nissan Tiida since 2016 after being displayed at the April 2016 Auto China. In other Asian markets, the Nissan Pulsar is launched in Singapore since January 2017.

The Pulsar was discontinued in Europe on 12 September 2018 due to poor demand, with Spanish production having ended in June of the same year. The Almera sedan was also discontinued in the Russian market alongside the Pulsar with sales and production ending in October 2018. The model is still sold in China under the Tiida nameplate with a 1.6-litre NA engine.

<text>The Man Who Japed is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in 1956. Although one of Dick&#x27;s lesser-known novels, it features several of the ideas and themes that recur throughout his later works. The &quot;jape[s]&quot; or practical jokes of the novel begin with a statue&#x27;s unconventional decapitation.

&quot;The Man Who Japed&quot; was first published by Ace Books as one half of Ace Double D-193, bound dos-à-dos with &quot;The Space Born&quot; by E. C. Tubb.

== Plot introduction ==
&quot;The Man Who Japed&quot; is set in the year 2114. After a devastating twentieth century limited nuclear war, a South African (&quot;Afrikaans Empire&quot;) military survivor named General Streiter launched a global revolution in 1985 that ushered in a totalitarian government. In one example of the carnage Dick has his protagonist Allen Purcell visit Japan&#x27;s northern island, Hokkaidō. The location is still a desolate wasteland that has not recovered from nuclear bombardment in 1972, the last year of the global war referred to within this book.

This regime - Moral Reclamation (&quot;Morec&quot;) - rules a post-apocalyptic world under its strict ideology. One of Streiter&#x27;s lineal descendants, Ida Pease Hoyt, is in charge. Morec has created an ultra-conservative and puritanical society that is oppressive and judgmental of its fellow citizens. Punishable offenses include mild public cursing, kissing a non-spouse, absenteeism from community meetings and the commercial display of neon signs. A thriving black market exists, however, where one can purchase the &quot;Decameron,&quot; James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, chablis wine and pulp fiction detective novels from the twentieth century.

Earth people also occupy several other planetary systems. There are human colonies on Bellatrix (Gamma Orionis), Sirius 8 and 9, and &quot;Orionus.&quot; On these worlds, intensive labour is required to provide agricultural and industrial products for survival. One of the planets is used as a &quot;Refuge&quot; for the rehabilitation of social misfits or &quot;nooses&quot;.

The &quot;japery&quot; alluded to in the title is Allen Purcell&#x27;s wanton destruction of a statue of General Streiter. But Purcell has only vague, distorted and disjointed memories of the act and doesn&#x27;t understand his own motivation for doing it. He is up for an appointment to a high-level position as a guardian of public ethics.

Purcell later intentionally concocts a history of General Streiter for a live televised broadcast that falsely claims Streiter had a policy of having his enemies butchered and served as meals to his family and himself. Hoyt is accused of continuing the practice of cannibalism.

Purcell and his wife are about to escape Morec justice when he has a change of heart and decides to remain on Earth and face the consequences of his crime. He promises his wife a trip to friend Myron Mavis&#x27;s planet when they both make it through to &quot;the other side&quot; of their punishment.

==Reception==
Anthony Boucher dismissed the novel as a &quot;hasty and disappointing&quot; effort.

<text>Girlie men is a pejorative term that was notably used by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to characterize opponents in the state legislature of California over the state budget.

==History of the phrase==
Schwarzenegger borrowed the term from a series of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches in which Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon played bodybuilders named Hans and Franz, large men with Austrian accents. The two characters, for comic reasons, were characterized as cousins of Schwarzenegger.

==Schwarzenegger&#x27;s usage==
The term was first used by Schwarzenegger, who was accompanied by then Vice President George H. W. Bush, in the 1988 presidential election. He attacked Bush&#x27;s opponents: &quot;They all look like a bunch of girlie men, right?&quot; He repeated it in the 1992 election, then campaigning for President Bush, again applying it to the Democratic candidates, as seen in the 1992 documentary &quot;Feed&quot; by Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgeway.

He used the phrase again on July 17, 2004: &quot;If they don&#x27;t have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... &#x27; if they don&#x27;t have the guts, I call them girlie men.&quot; He would use the term twice in the speech.

Schwarzenegger would later use the term again at the 2004 Republican National Convention, where he implored the audience not to be pessimistic about the economy, saying &quot;Don&#x27;t be economic girlie men.&quot;

Schwarzenegger was criticized by various gay rights and feminist groups. California State Senator Sheila Kuehl, who is a member of the legislature&#x27;s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus, claimed that the governor had resorted to &quot;blatant homophobia&quot;, stating that the phrase &quot;uses an image that is associated with gay men in an insulting way, and it was supposed to be an insult. That&#x27;s very troubling that he would use such a homophobic way of trying to put down legislative leadership.&quot; Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, said he was not upset by the remark but that his 13-year-old daughter was. &quot;She&#x27;s a young girl who knows the governor and really likes him a lot and didn&#x27;t find the term to be a positive term, and finds it to be derogatory,&quot; Nunez said. &quot;It was no question a very, very insensitive comment to make. I personally am not intimidated or threatened by it, but I think it really is beneath Gov. Schwarzenegger.&quot; Jeff Bissiri, the Log Cabin Republicans&#x27; California Director, defended Schwarzenegger, responding to Kuehl&#x27;s statements by stating that &quot;the Governor&#x27;s use of the term &#x27;girlie man&#x27; was not a slur aimed at the gay and lesbian community and Senator Kuehl knows that ... Where was her outrage when the Bustamante campaign referred to candidate Schwarzenegger as a &#x27;sissy&#x27; for not agreeing to an endless series of debates?&quot;

===Regrets===
In an October 2018 interview with &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine, Schwarzenegger expressed regret for using the phrase:

At the time it felt like the right thing to do. It was in my gut. I improvised it. I called them girlie men because they weren&#x27;t willing to take risks. They were afraid of everything. Politicians in general want to do little things so there&#x27;s no risk involved. But it was shortsighted. In the long term, it&#x27;s better to not say that, because you want to work with them.

==Other public uses==
The term, popularized initially by the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, received new life following Schwarzenegger&#x27;s usage. &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion columnist Maureen Dowd quoted a Democratic insider who claimed that 2004 Presidential candidate John Kerry had &quot;turned into a girlie man&quot;.

Hans and Franz, a bodybuilding duo on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, often used the term to talk about &quot;pathetic, flabby losers&quot;. This term has been carried over to the State Farm commercials.

Jack Kemp, former Republican Congressman and Vice Presidential Nominee, used the phrase in criticizing Democratic economic policies in his column &quot;Don&#x27;t be economic girlie-men.&quot;

In the video game &quot;Get Medieval&quot; the barbarian character spoofs Schwarzenegger&#x27;s voice and thick accent and refers to the hordes of opponents as &quot;girliemonsters&quot;.

Australian Minister for Finance, Mathias Cormann, who was born in German-speaking Belgium, used the phrase &quot;economic girlie-man&quot; to describe opposition leader Bill Shorten in 2014. The phrase had previously been used on the comedy program &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Mad as Hell&quot; by the fictitious &quot;spokesman for Finance Minister, Darius Horsham&quot;, mocking Cormann&#x27;s accent; since Cormann&#x27;s use, the phrase has regularly appeared in skits featuring Horsham.

==Linguistic analysis==
In an article in the journal &quot;American Speech&quot;, linguist Edwin Battistella analyzes the development of the expression from ironic mockery of bodybuilding culture to an overt connotation of weakness and a covert connotation of effeminacy. He writes:

In all this usage, girly-man is implicitly contrasted with such terms as he-man, macho-man, or manly man. These terms bring together images of physique, strength, courage, and will in an image of comic-book manliness. The controlling male stereotype is that of the muscular action-hero male as manly and of other men (non–weight lifters, nonmacho straight men, gays) as lacking courage, strength, and decisiveness. As critics of the usage pointed out, referring to someone as a girly-man requires adopting this stereotype as an instrument of either humor or derogation. And it further entails adopting the complementary stereotype that women are not so strong or decisive as men.

Contrasting the expression &quot;girly girl&quot; with &quot;girly man,&quot; Battistella suggests that in the former the adjective intensifies the stereotype present in the noun, while in the latter the adjective negates components of the stereotype to produce a range of derisive meanings.

<doc id="1168120" wikidata="Q628166" url="?curid=1168120" title="Mitsubishi Pajero Mini">
<text>The is a kei car produced by Mitsubishi Motors from December 1994 until June 2012.

==Overview==
Based on the platform of the Minica, the Pajero Mini was styled as a miniature version of the company&#x27;s successful Pajero sport utility vehicle, in response to the SUV craze of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Compared to the full-sized original, the &quot;kei&quot; vehicle was considerably smaller and was fitted with gas 660 cc four-cylinder engines.

The popularity of the vehicle inspired Mitsubishi to create several limited editions, including the &quot;Iron Cross&quot;, &quot;Desert Cruiser&quot;, &quot;White Skipper&quot; and &quot;Duke&quot;. 


==First generation (1994; H51/56A)==
The original Pajero Mini was first presented in December 1994. It was available with a choice of naturally aspirated or turbocharged 659 cc four cylinder engines with . Two- or four-wheel drive were available, with 2WD models receiving the H51A model code and four-wheel drives being H56A. The four-wheel-drive model outsold the two-wheel-drive Pajero Mini at a rate of at least 6 to 1. A larger-engined version with a wider track (and correspondingly larger fender flares) was presented in October 1995; this was sold as the Mitsubishi Pajero Junior. The turbocharged models were VR-I or VR-II depending on equipment levels, while the naturally aspirated versions were called XR-I and XR-II. The &quot;-I&quot; versions received little standard equipment and can easily be recognized by their steel wheels, black bumpers and other trim such as door handles and rear view mirrors, and minimal brightwork. The more expensive -II models were usually painted two-tone and often receive alloy wheels and various pieces of chrome trim.

In May 1996 the Pajero Mini &quot;Skipper&quot;, a special version for urban and town use, was released. The name is a reference to Mitsubishi&#x27;s Minica Skipper kei car coupé of the early 1970s. In December 1997, the Pajero Mini Duke was released. This had a somewhat more rugged appearance, including sturdy cladding along the sides and a grille with upright bars, a reference to Jeeps and Mitsubishi&#x27;s history of license manufacturing the CJ-3B for four-and-a-half decades.


==Second generation (1998; H53/58A)==
In October 1998 the &quot;kei car&quot; regulations were again updated, and the Pajero Mini was widened and lengthened accordingly at the same time. The &quot;Duke&quot; special model was carried over; it now received a larger, deeper set grille with vertical rather than horizontal bars. Two- or four-wheel drive were once again available, with 2WD models receiving the H53A model code and four-wheel drives being H58A (H57A had been used for the Pajero Junior; that model was never available with two-wheel drive, but H52A was skipped nonetheless). 

In Japan, the Pajero Mini was sold at a specific retail chain called &quot;Galant Shop&quot;. Since 2008 Mitsubishi has produced the , an OEM version of the Pajero Mini, expanding a similar deal already in place for the Mitsubishi eK/Nissan Otti.

Production of the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini ended in June 2012.

<text>The third USS &quot;Chippewa&quot; was a which saw service with the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Construction and service==

One of the &quot;Ninety-day gunboats,&quot; &quot;Chippewa&quot; was launched 14 September 1861 by Webb and Bell, New York; outfitted at New York Navy Yard; and commissioned 13 December 1861, Lieutenant Andrew Bryson in command.

Sailing from New York 25 December 1861 &quot;Chippewa&quot; took station on the blockade between Fort Monroe, Virginia, and Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, remaining there until 9 August 1862 except for a brief repair period at Baltimore, Maryland 8 March–13 March. During this time she exchanged fire with the enemy at Forts Macon and Caswell and Federal Point Batteries, and assisted in the capture of a blockade runner, the English brig &quot;Napier&quot; 29 July 1862. &quot;Chippewa&quot; arrived at the Washington Navy Yard, 10 August 1862.

Returning to Fort Monroe she departed from there 18 October 1862 on a cruise in search of CSS &quot;Florida&quot; which took her to the Azores; Algeciras and Cádiz, Spain; Gibraltar; Funchal, Madeira; Porto Grande, Africa; Cape Verde Islands; and various ports in the West Indies. Returning to Port Royal, South Carolina, 30 May 1863, she resumed patrols with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. She participated in the attacks on Fort Wagner, South Carolina, from 13 to 21 July 1863, and opened fire on enemy pickets up Broad River, on 12 November. After repairs at Philadelphia Navy Yard, she returned to North Carolina to take part in the bombardments and capture of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865 and Fort Anderson, Cape Fear River, North Carolina, in February 1865.

&quot;Chippewa&quot; departed Wilmington, North Carolina, 1 March 1865 and steamed up the James River for patrol duty until 15 May, engaging enemy batteries at Dutch Gap Canal on 1 April and 2 April.

==End of service==

After cruising to Havana, Cuba, between 17 May and 12 June 1865, &quot;Chippewa&quot; arrived at Boston 17 June where she was decommissioned 24 June 1865, taken to New York 29 June and sold there 30 November 1865.

<text>Capital One Financial Corporation is an American bank holding company founded on July 21, 1994, and specializing in credit cards, auto loans, banking, and savings accounts, headquartered in McLean, Virginia with operations primarily in the United States. It is the ninth largest bank in the United States by total assets , the third largest issuer of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and one of the largest car finance companies in the United States.

The bank has approximately 750 branches, including 30 café style locations, and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked 91st on the Fortune 500, 15th on Fortune&#x27;s 100 Best Companies to Work For list, and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s.

The company&#x27;s three divisions are credit cards, consumer banking and commercial banking. , the company had loans receivable of $114 billion from credit cards, $75 billion from auto loans, and $85 billion from commercial loans. The company has been fined by regulators for its role in money-laundering on separate occasions and been subject to consumer class action lawsuits and government investigations in relations to its treatment of customers.

==History==
===Monoline credit card company (1994–2004)===
Richard Fairbank and Nigel Morris developed the idea of using information technology and statistical analysis to create customized credit card offers for different segments of customers in 1987. At the time, most credit cards would offer the same terms—interest rate and annual fee—to almost everyone, regardless of the financial risks of each customer. However, Fairbank and Morris&#x27; idea was to drop the fee and target various credit card terms to specific customers. They consulted with Oracle Corporation on how to compile the demographics and other statistics that would help them sort out and identify those customer market segments. Funding Universe wrote: “Fairbank and Morris’s plan would allow companies to fine-tune card product and pricing strategies for individual customers through a decision-making structure blending together marketing, credit, risk, operations and technology functions.&quot;

They then started soliciting banks regarding using their approach, indicating that they anticipated large profits based on the large numbers of customers they projected to enroll. They convinced Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Bank (now part of Wells Fargo) to start a credit card division called Signet Financial in 1988 that would utilize their approach. As part of the deal, they became employees of Signet. In 1991, Fairbank and Morris had a great success with a mass mailing that offered to transfer existing credit card balances from other banks&#x27; credit cards for the opportunity of a lower interest rate with Signet.

On July 21, 1994, Signet Financial Corp announced the corporate spin-off of Signet Financial, at first naming it OakStone Financial with Fairbank as CEO and Morris as COO. After the initial public offering, the new company was renamed Capital One in October 1994 and the spin-off was completed in February 1995.

At that time, Capital One was a &quot;monoline&quot; bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards. This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times. Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit directly to consumers.

===Expansion into auto loans (1996–present)===
In 1996, Capital One moved from relying on teaser rates to generate new clients to adopting more innovative techniques that would attract more customers to their business model. At the time, it was losing customers to competitors who offered higher ceilings on loan balances and no-annual-fee accounts. The company came up with co-branded, secured, and joint account credit cards. In mid-1996, Capital One received approval from the federal government to set up Capital One FSB. This meant that the company could now retain and lend out deposits on secured cards and even issue automobile installment loans.

In 1996, Capital One expanded its business operations to the United Kingdom and Canada. This gave the company access to a large international market for its credit cards. An article appearing in &quot;Chief Executive&quot; in 1997 noted that the company held $12.6 billion in credit card receivables and served more than nine million customers. The company was listed in the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500, and its stock price hit the $100 mark for the first time in 1998.

In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.

In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One&#x27;s experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.

In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One. The companies were combined and re-branded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.

In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement (NSA) for bulk discounts in mailing services. The resulting three-year agreement was extended in 2006. In June 2008, however, Capital One filed a complaint with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement, citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One&#x27;s competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.

Automobile loan financer Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in January 2005.

===Expansion into retail banking (2005–present)===

In 2005 Capital One became the first monoline credit card issuer to buy a bank, as it entered into retail banking by acquiring Hibernia National Bank. It purchased the New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia for $4.9 billion in cash and stock. It acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006. The acquisition of retail banks greatly reduced its dependency on the credit-card business alone. It briefly considered acquiring Netspend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million in 2007, but the deal was not ultimately completed.

In 2008, Capital One debuted their blue and red &quot;swoosh&quot; logo, and underwent a $13 billion marketing campaign in the following years. The similarity of Credit One Bank&#x27;s logo and the Capital One logo caused confusion among consumers, with many not realizing they were separate companies. Credit One Bank adopted their black and blue &quot;swoosh&quot; logo in 2006.

In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.

In January 2011, Capital One acquired Canada-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s private credit card portfolio from Synchrony Financial, then known as GE Financial.

In April 2011, Capital One signed a deal with Kohl&#x27;s to handle Kohl&#x27;s private label credit card program that was previously serviced by Chase Bank for a seven-year period for an undisclosed amount. The contract between the two companies was extended in May 2014.

In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations. Capital One paid $31.3 billion in exchange for $28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed in May 2012. The acquisition also included private issued credit cards for such companies as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Lord &amp; Taylor that were previously handled by HSBC.

In February 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system. However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.

In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.

In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to &quot;contact you in any manner we choose&quot;, including a &quot;personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment&quot;. It also asserted its right to &quot;modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose&quot;. The company stated that it would not actually make personal visits to customers except &quot;As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle&quot;. Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to &quot;spoof&quot; as necessary because &quot;sometimes the number is &#x27;displayed differently&#x27; by &#x27;some local phone exchanges,&#x27; something that is &#x27;beyond our control&#x27;&quot;.

In February 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a Peer-to-peer transaction money transfer service designed to make electronic funds transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address. ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.

In October 2014, Capital One acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco-based user experience and digital design consultancy.

In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.

In July 2019, Capital One signed a deal with Walmart to handle Walmart&#x27;s private label and co-branded credit card programs that was previously serviced by Synchrony Financial. Walmart terminated the deal in April 2024 after customer service failures by Capital One.
In November 2021, the company introduced Venture X, a travel rewards credit card, with a $395 annual fee.

====Exit from mortgage banking (2006–2007 and 2011–2017)====
In December 2006, Capital One acquired its GreenPoint Mortgage unit when the company paid $13.2 billion for North Fork Bancorp Inc. During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures, cutting 1,900 jobs and costing the company $860 million in charges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One&#x27;s conduct during the crisis, claiming that they understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing. In 2008, Capital One received an investment of $3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of $3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.

The re-emergence into the mortgage industry came in June 2011, when ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for $9 billion in cash and stock. On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22. The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or &quot;Too-Big-to-Fail,&quot; performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups argued that the acquisition was a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal. In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct. Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012, and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.

In November 2017, President of Financial Services Sanjiv Yajnik announced that the mortgage market was too competitive in the low rate environment to make money in the business. The company exited the mortgage origination business on November 7, 2017, laying off 1,100 employees.

====Television advertisements====
Beginning in 2010, Alec Baldwin appeared in a television campaign for Capital One as their spokesperson. Following his 2013 confrontation with a videographer reported by TMZ, his contract was not renewed, and he was succeeded in the campaign by Jennifer Garner.

In 2012 Capital One released an advert featuring British power metal band DragonForce. The advert showed Herman Li and Sam Totman playing guitar on an asteroid while using Capital One&#x27;s mobile app.

===Other acquisitions===
====Confyrm====
In May 2018, the company acquired Confyrm, a digital identity and fraud alert service.

====Capital One Shopping====
In November 2018, Capital One acquired Wikibuy, a shopping comparison app and browser extension from an Austin, Texas start-up business; Wikibuy has no connection with Wikipedia/Wikimedia. Wikibuy continues to operate the service which is now named Capital One Shopping.

====Discover Financial Services====

Capital One announced in February 2024 that it had agreed to acquire Discover Financial in an all-stock deal worth $35.3 billion. If the deal is approved by regulators, the combined company will become the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. Jamie Dimon, CEO of rival firm, JPMorgan Chase, said he welcomed the deal, even if his bank would be surpassed as the country&#x27;s biggest credit card lender. He also praised the firm&#x27;s CEO, Richard Fairbank.

The Attorney General of New York launched an investigation into whether the company&#x27;s takeover of Discover would violate state anti-trust laws. In July 2024, a proposed consumer class action lawsuit was also filed in Virginia, claiming that it would be in violation of federal antitrust laws, forming the largest U.S. credit card issuer by balance and sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets.

==Divisions==
Capital One operates 3 divisions as follows:
* Credit cards – Capital One issues credit cards in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom and is the 3rd largest credit card issuer, after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. , Capital One had $107.350 billion in credit card loans outstanding in the United States and $9.011 billion of credit card loans outstanding in Canada and the United Kingdom, with credit cards representing 47.3% of total loans outstanding.

* Commercial banking – , Capital One had $70.333 billion in loans outstanding secured by commercial, multifamily, and industrial properties, representing 28.6% of total loans outstanding.

==Sports marketing==

From 2001 to 2014, Capital One was the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which was called the Capital One Bowl from 2003 to 2014. It sponsored a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. The name of the bowl game was changed in 2015 to the Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl.

Capital One is the title sponsor of the Orange Bowl since 2015.

Capital One Venture X is the presenting sponsor of the Rose Bowl Game since 2022.

Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data. Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English soccer knockout tournament, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored English soccer clubs Nottingham Forest from 2003 to 2009 and Sheffield United from 2006 to 2008. From 2009 to 2022, the University of Maryland Terrapins football team played at Capital One Field at Maryland Stadium (formerly Byrd Stadium), a naming-rights deal inherited in the bank&#x27;s acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank. In 2017, the company became the sponsor of the Capital One Arena in Washington D.C.

In 2018, to celebrate the Washington Capitals&#x27; second-ever Stanley Cup Finals appearance, the firm temporarily changed its logo by replacing the word &quot;Capital&quot; with the Capitals&#x27; titular logo, without the &quot;s&quot; plural.

In March 2022, Major League Baseball announced that Capital One is the official bank and credit card and presenting sponsor of the World Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNBC Cap One-MLB Deal, 3/28/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2022, Capital One also announced a partnership with Vivid Seats Inc. to launch Capital One Entertainment, a rewards programs for cards holders.

==Corporate citizenship==
Capital One operates some charitable programs. The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One&#x27;s relatively low rate of giving, stating that &quot;Capital One&#x27;s philanthropic track record is dismal&quot;. The organization pointed out that Capital One&#x27;s donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue. Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that &quot;... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP&quot;.

==Investigations and legal actions==
===Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services===
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, for example by requiring customers to pay extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card. The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers. This was the CFPB&#x27;s first public enforcement action.

===Automated dialing to customers&#x27; phones===
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers&#x27; cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the &quot;prior express written consent&quot; requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.

===July 2019 security breach===
Capital One publicly acknowledged on July 29, 2019, that they had found unauthorized access had occurred ten days earlier by an individual who had breached the account and identity security of 106 million people in the United States and Canada, one of the largest data breaches of personal information. The FBI arrested Paige Thompson, who had previously worked as a software engineer for Amazon Web Services, Capital One&#x27;s cloud hosting company. Capital One declared that Thompson had accessed about 140,000 Social Security numbers, a million Canadian social insurance numbers; 80,000 bank account numbers, and an unknown number of names and addresses of customers. Capital One began offering free credit monitoring services and identity protection to those affected by the breach. It was ultimately determined there was no evidence the data was shared by Thompson.

Amazon stated that the security vulnerability she used to access Capital One could have been discovered by anyone, the information that facilitated her activity was not gained from work at Amazon, and that she gained access via &quot;a misconfiguration of the (Capital One-designed) web application and not the underlying (Amazon-designed) cloud-based infrastructure&quot;.

In 2022, Thompson was convicted of five felonies and two misdemeanors. She was sentenced to time served and five years of probation.

==== Capital One response ====
Capital One was alerted to the breach on July 17, 2019, twelve days before they publicly acknowledged it. Several Capital One customers stated that the first time they heard about the hack was through the media and the bank did not disclose the breach or explain its implications to affected customers. On social media and in the mainstream press, Capital One&#x27;s contradictory July 2019 press statement was mocked for saying &quot;No bank account numbers or Social Security numbers were compromised,&quot; but then listing hundreds of thousands of bank account numbers and social security numbers that were compromised.

==== Federal Reserve Action ====
On August 6, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced a cease and desist order against Capital One resulting from the breach. The order mandated, among other things, significant improvements in Capital One&#x27;s governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) practices. The Federal Reserve ended the enforcement action in 2023.

==== Lawsuits ====
Lawsuits were filed against Capital One and its employees in federal and circuit courts, led by the firms Colson Hicks Eidson, Franklin D. Azar and Associates P.C., and several others.

Additional lawsuits were filed against both Amazon and GitHub, alleging they were aware of the exploit but did not act to fix or patch the vulnerability.

Two consumer class action lawsuits filed against Capital One in Virginia were reported in July 2024. A suit related to its acquisition of ING Direct USA, in 2012, claimed that, since February 2013, the company unfairly maintained 360 Savings online savings account as a higher yield rate than was available to its other depositors. Later that month, a proposed consumer class action was also filed, in a bid to block a merger with Discover Financial, claiming that the acquisition would be in violation of federal antitrust laws.

=== Government investigations ===
In 2015 the bank disclosed that it was under federal investigation for bank fraud, money laundering, and possible racketeering charges. No further information was given and government investigators would only confirm that it was under scrutiny for &quot;unspecified charges&quot;.

In 2018, Capital One was fined $100 million for failure to monitor, detect, and prevent money laundering. Charging documents specified Capital One failed to file suspicious activity reports, had deficiencies in its risk assessment, remote deposit capture and generally had weaknesses that compromised national bank security controls. The bank was the subject of a larger investigation that alleged funds were siphoned out of US jurisdiction to safe havens.

In January 2021, Capital One was fined $390 million by FINCEN for anti-money laundering control failure concerning a now-defunct small portfolio of check-cashing businesses that Capital One acquired around 2008 and subsequently exited from in 2014. Capital One later admitted that it failed to file thousands of suspicious activity reports and lapsed on filing currency transaction reports on around 50,000 reportable cash transactions valued around $16 billion.

In January 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Capital One for cheating savings account holders out of $2 billion by &quot;deceptive, abusive and illegal&quot; practices which obscured the difference between the high-interest &quot;360 Performance Savings&quot; accounts vs. low-interest &quot;360 Savings&quot; accounts. In February 2025, shortly after Donald Trump became president, the CFPB dropped its lawsuit against Capital One.

<doc id="1168160" wikidata="Q1066028" url="?curid=1168160" title="Charles Schwab Corporation">
<text>The Charles Schwab Corporation is an American multinational financial services company. It offers banking, commercial banking, investing and related services including consulting, and wealth management advisory services to both retail and institutional clients. It has over 380 branches, primarily in financial centers in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets. it had $8.5 trillion in client assets, 34.8 million active brokerage accounts, 5.2 million corporate retirement plan participants, and 1.8 million banking accounts. It also offers a donor advised fund for clients seeking to donate securities. It was founded in San Francisco, California, and is headquartered in Westlake, Texas.

Founded as Charles Schwab &amp; Co. in 1971 by its namesake Charles R. Schwab, the company capitalized on the financial deregulation of the 1970s to pioneer discount sales of equity securities. After a flagship opening in Sacramento, California, the bank expanded into Seattle before the 1980s economic expansion financed the bank&#x27;s investments in technology, automation, and digital record keeping. The first to offer round-clock order entry and quotation, it was purchased by Bank of America in 1983 for $55 million. Three years later, the profitability of the bank&#x27;s no-charge mutual funds prompted the founder to buy his company back for $280 million.

==History==

In 1963, Charles R. Schwab and two other partners launched &quot;Investment Indicator&quot;, an investment newsletter. At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe. In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries. In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc.

In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a stock brokerage. In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1979, Schwab risked $500,000 on a back-office settlement system called BETA (short for Brokerage Execution and Transaction Analysis), enabling Schwab to become the first discount broker to bring automation in house. In 1980, Schwab established the industry&#x27;s first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000. In 1981, Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.

In 1983, Stephen McLin purchased the company for Bank of America for $55 million. In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load mutual funds. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company back from Bank of America for $280 million. In 1991, the company acquired Mayer &amp; Schweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers&#x27; orders without sending them to an exchange. In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers. The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000. In 1993, the company opened an office in London.

In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008. In 1996, Web trading went live, letting customers trade listed and OTC stocks, or check balances and the status of orders on the schwab.com website. In 1998, dissatisfied by in-house results, the company hired interactive firm Razorfish to redesign the website. Years later the website would be entered in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum&#x27;s inaugural National Design Triennial. In 2000, Schwab purchased U.S. Trust for $2.73 billion. In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board. On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash. The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007.

In January 2004, Schwab acquired SoundView Technology Group for $345 million to add equity research capabilities. David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab&#x27;s right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company&#x27;s founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company&#x27;s board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck&#x27;s removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10%, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26% decline in revenue from customer stock trading.

After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had &quot;lost touch with our heritage&quot;, and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck&#x27;s fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck&#x27;s removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab. The company&#x27;s net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008. Schwab&#x27;s YieldPlus fund drew controversy during the 2007 financial crisis because of its -31.7% return. Investors in the Schwab YieldPlus Fund, including Charles Schwab himself, lost $1.1 billion. Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011. In April 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company.

On July 22, 2008, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous chief operating officer, was named chief executive, succeeding the company&#x27;s namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained executive chairman of the company and said that he would &quot;continue to serve as a very active chairman&quot;.

In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress. The company also acquired Compliance11, Inc., a provider of compliance software. In 2012, it acquired ThomasPartners, an asset management firm.

On July 1, 2020, the company acquired Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, an independent investment manager of fixed income in separately managed accounts with $10.7 billion in assets under management.

On May 26, 2020, the company acquired USAA&#x27;s investment management accounts for $1.8 billion in cash.

In June 2020, the company began allowing investors to purchase fractional shares.

On October 6, 2020, the company acquired TD Ameritrade. As part of the acquisition, Toronto-Dominion Bank acquired around 12 percent ownership in the company. In early 2025, TD Bank exited its stake in Schwab.

Effective on January 1, 2021, the company moved its headquarters from San Francisco, California to Westlake, Texas.

On January 1, 2025, Rick Wurster assumed the CEO position of the company, replacing the retiring Walt Bettinger.

==Marketing==
In 2004, Charles Schwab chose Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) as its full-service advertising agency. The company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan &quot;Talk to Chuck&quot; by Euro RSCG and directed/animated by Bob Sabiston&#x27;s Flat Black Films in 2005. &quot;Talk to Chuck&quot; campaign appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices. A blog post in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase. In February 2013, Schwab hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) as its lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress. The company launched an advertising campaign by CP+B with the slogan &quot;Own Your Tomorrow&quot; that same year. In March 2015, Adweek reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab&#x27;s Intelligent Portfolio service.

==Controversies==
===Failure to disclose robo-advisor fees and allocations===
In June 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the company to pay $187 million to settle its charges for failing to disclose fund allocations and fees for its robo-advisor clients. It was determined that between March 2015 to November 2018, Charles Schwab misled customers and prospective investors by allowing them to believe that its robo-advisor service had no hidden fees, and it did not inform the clients about the cash drag on their investments. The SEC stated that the company has made money from cash allocations in the robo-advisor portfolios by sweeping cash to its affiliated bank, loaning it out, and keeping the difference between the interest it earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to the robo-advisor clients.

<text>Henfield is a large village and civil parish in the Horsham District of West Sussex, England. It lies south of London, northwest of Brighton, and east northeast of the county town of Chichester at the road junction of the A281 and A2037. The parish has a land area of . In the 2001 census 5,012 people lived in 2,153 households, of whom 2,361 were economically active. Other nearby towns include Burgess Hill to the east and Shoreham-by-Sea to the south.

Just west of the village, the two branches of the River Adur, the western Adur and the eastern Adur, meet at Betley Bridge. From Henfield the Adur flows on into the English Channel at Shoreham-by-Sea.

Henfield was already a large village, of 52 households, at the time of Domesday (1086).

==Facilities==

One of the largest village communities in the Horsham district, Henfield has an old and attractive centre.

It has a modern and intensely used village hall just off the High Street, the 13th-century St Peter&#x27;s church, old inns, a wide and attractive common, and many interesting houses in private ownership.

There is a fire station, part of the West Sussex Fire Brigade, equipped with a single fire engine.

Henfield has one of the oldest cricket clubs in the world, dating back to 1771. A women&#x27;s team was formed from 2006.

Henfield also officially has the oldest Scout group in the country (1st Henfield), dating from 1907. When officially registered in 1908 there were 36 scouts in the group. The group was started in winter 1907-8 by Audrey Wade, whose brother, A. G. Wade, had met Robert Baden-Powell when both were travelling to the UK from Africa when they were in the army. A. G. Wade later had several administrative roles in the developing Scout movement.

To the south is Woods Mill, a restored mill, now the headquarters of the Sussex Wildlife Trust, its attractions including an extensive nature trail.

Also south of the village on the road towards Small Dole is a business park containing the Royal Mail Delivery Office, the Etwars and several notable small businesses.

There is also a theatre company which is held in the village hall.

=== Sports facilities ===
Henfield Leisure Centre at Northcroft has a sports hall and fitness suite. There is a small skate park located next to the sports centre. Near to the leisure centre is Henfield tennis club, founded in 1920.

=== The Cat House ===
The Cat House is at Pinchnose Green, so called because there used to be a tannery nearby and the process of tanning produces unpleasant odours. This house was once owned by George Ward who had a canary. This bird was killed by a cat belonging to the Anglican Canon Nathaniel Woodard who lived at nearby Martyn Lodge. So incensed was Ward that he painted his house with pictures of a cat holding a bird that would be seen by the canon every time he walked past on his way to the church. He also rigged up strings of sea shells to rattle, and a black figure would appear at a small window called the zulu hole when the hapless canon was seen approaching.

=== Henfield Museum ===
Started in the 1930s, Henfield Museum moved to its current location in the Henfield Hall in 1974. It contains collections related to local events and people from mesolithic times onwards as well as local natural history. It also contains materials linked to local people such as Marjorie Baker and William Borrer and enterprises including the Allen-Brown Violet Nurseries and local railway station (closed in 1966). It is run by the Friends of Henfield Museum and the Henfield Parish Council.

== Notable areas ==
Henfield is home to the Sussex Wildlife Trust headquarters, four commons, brooks, moors and tributaries to the River Adur.

===Henfield&#x27;s Commons===
Henfield Parish Council supports four Commons: Henfield Common, Broadmere Common, Oreham Common and the Tanyard. All are ecologically rich and support a diverse range of wildlife.

==== Henfield Common ====
Henfield Common () is at the southern end of the High Street. It covers almost 20 hectares, including a cricket pitch, two football fields, rich marshland and heathy grassland. It is botanically important and supports a wide range of wildlife. Its main character historically was that of a moor and three quarters of its special plants grow best on marsh or wet ground and the other quarter on heath and grasslands. In June and July the southern marsh orchid can be seen amongst the common spotted orchid. In the late summer to the south of the marsh, the grass can be tinted purple by the devil&#x27;s-bit scabious. There are surviving patches of wild chamomile on the cricket pitch also. In autumn, there are many species of field fungi including waxcaps and fairy clubs on the heath. The natural environment also supports much fauna and conservation groups monitor the area.

Despite the historical botanical richness and beauty of the common, many species have already been lost from the area since the drainage ditch was dug in 1886, making the area less wet. Lost species include small fleabane, starfruit, mudwort, lesser marshwort, bogbean, sundew, marsh cinquefoil, beaked and white sedges, chaffweed and bog-myrtle. Recent changes in the management of the Common mean even more species have been lost or are rapidly disappearing including dwarf gorse, common heather and petty whin. In 2017 disaster struck for the future of the botanical richness and the accompanying, often unseen, wildlife of the Common when the football pitches were sprayed with herbicide and ploughed destroying the glorious chamomile lawn and the recovering marsh vegetation. In the process heath and southern marsh orchids, marsh pennywort and the only patch of scarce adder&#x27;s tongue fern were killed. If any of the botanical richness of the area is going to persist, the marsh will benefit from re-wetting and the heath will benefit from grazing, as well as mowing.

==== Broadmere Common ====
Broadmere Common () is at the eastern end of Dag Brooks and is almost 5 hectares. The name derives from the old English term &quot;broad mere&quot; meaning broad lake due its wetness. It has many pools, many of which were originally dug for the clay needed for brick-making. It has many precious plants though including yellow flag, goat willow, meadowsweet, occasional marsh woundwort and even scarce meadow brome. In the ponds there are water mint, greater bird&#x27;s-foot-trefoil, common fleabane and swan mussels. Once it was famed by botanists for even rarer local plants including small fleabane, starfruit, mudwort and lesser marshwort, but of these only the lesser marshwort still exists and its survival is threatened by the invasive Australian swamp stonecrop. Palmate newts are present in the ponds and the Common can still support a number of Birds of Conservation Concern including nightingale and cuckoo, and even lesser spotted woodpecker has been seen there. The richness of the Common fauna and flora will benefit from having the ponds cleared and the land grazed.

==== Oreham Common ====
Oreham Common () is almost 6 hectares. In Old English ora means flat top hill and hamm means &quot;a patch of flat, low-lying alluvial land beside a stream&quot;. Horn Lane runs through its centre, which is part of the longest section of the Greensand Way Roman road that still functions as a road (around 1 mile). It is rich in flora such as common meadow-rue, sneezewort, pepper saxifrage, greater bird&#x27;s-foot-trefoil, adder&#x27;s tongue fern and common spotted orchids, many grasses and even more herbaceous plants. Palmate newts are present in the ponds and the Common can support a number of Birds of Conservation Concern including nightingale and turtle dove and butterflies such as purple hairstreak and brown argus. Like Broadmere Common the fauna and flora will benefit from having the ponds cleared and the land grazed. Additional traffic calming measures will help improve the area.

=== Woods Mill ===
Woods Mill is the headquarters of the Sussex Wildlife Trust and an environmental education centre. It is an area of 47 acres. There is an ancient woodland, a lake, streams and unimproved meadows with wild hedgerows.

=== Henfield Brooks ===
Henfield brooks () are to the east of the River Adur and to the south west of the village. The fields flood regularly during winter rains. In spring the brooks are full of life with marsh frogs, lapwings, reed buntings and traditionally the call of the cuckoo, although that is becoming rarer. In summer the ditches support scarce plants such as greater water parsnip (an aquatic plant which has seen a massive reduction recently and now only occurs in around 50 sites in England), water dropwort, arrowhead and flowering rush. The area can support common snipe, lesser spotted woodpecker and little owl.

===Henfield Moors===
Between Henfield Common and Woodmancote Place is a low plain with fine unimproved wet rush pastures known as The Moors. The ground is made from the Sussex Gault Clay. gorse and birch line the fences and the two ditches support bog pondweed. Behind the Swains Farm shop, in the pony-grazed western fields there is the largest population of (and best managed) meadow thistle in Sussex. You can also find heath spotted orchid, lousewort, tormentil, ragged-robin, marsh pennywort and at least six sedges.

===The Pokerlee stream===
The Pokerlee Stream is a lovely tributary of the Adur that runs through the Beeding, Horton, and Dag brooks, south of Henfield, Nep Town and The Pools meadows and ends up going through a tiny triangular bluebell wood on the north side of Horn Lane. It separates the Wealden Clay of Oreham from the fertile Greensand ridge&#x27;s large arable fields. The best access is from the south of Henfield. Like many of the steams of east of the Adur, parts have been straightened, partly for mill leats and partly for land drainage. There was a farmstead and barns of the same name (). Only the farm pond and a little leading down to the Horton brooks survives.

The name, Pokerlee, is first recorded (indirectly) in 1327. The first element might be the word poker, &#x27;hobgoblin&#x27;, which is of Scandinavian origin and survives as the Durham place-name &#x27;Pokerley&#x27;. However, as this is a southern usage this is not very likely. Thus, it could alternatively mean &quot;one who has to do with a poke or bag&quot;, which survives in its diminutive form as &#x27;pocket&#x27; and in the saying &#x27;a pig in a poke&#x27; (sack) which refers to something bought without inspection or through a confidence trick. The second element of word, lee, refers to a meadow or a clearing.

==History==
Henfield was the home of Colonel Henry Bishop, who was appointed Postmaster General by King Charles II in January 1660–61. Bishop devised the first type of postmark used in England, which is known to collectors as a Bishop mark. His invention was commemorated in 1963, on the occasion of an exhibition by Henfield Stamp Club. A special date stamp, which included the wording HENRY BISHOP&#x27;S VILLAGE, was used. Bishop is buried in Henfield churchyard.

The eighteenth century botanist William Borrer, who specialised in the flora of the British Isles, was born and died in Henfield.

When the British government introduced the Cat and Mouse Act in 1913, local Suffragette Elizabeth Robins used her 15th century farmhouse at Backsettown, near Henfield, that she shared with Octavia Wilberforce, as a retreat for suffragettes recovering from hunger strike. Robins was the first president of the Henfield Women&#x27;s Institute which was founded in 1917.

<text>Confessional writing is a literary style and genre that developed in American writing schools following the Second World War. A prominent mode of confessional writing is confessional poetry, which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. Confessional writing is often historically associated with Postmodernism due to the features which the modes share: including self-performativity and self-reflexivity; discussions of culturally taboo subjects; and the literary influences of personal conflict and historical trauma. Confessional writing also has historical origins in Catholic confessional practices. As such, confessional writing is congruent with psychoanalytic literary criticism. Confessional writing is also a form of life writing, especially through the autobiography form.

Confessional writing usually involves the disclosure of personal revelations and secrets, often in first-person, non-fiction forms such as diaries and memoirs. Confessional writing often employs colloquial speech and direct language to invoke an immediacy between reader and author. Confessional writers also use this direct language to radically reduce the distance between the speaker-persona of a text and the writer&#x27;s personal voice. Confessional writing can also be fictive, such as in the hybrid form of the &quot;roman à clef&quot;.

Though originating in American literary circles, by writers and poets such as Adrienne Rich, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton, the style has gained global use concurrently with the growth of Postcolonial theory at the end of the 20th century, especially throughout Eurasia and the Middle East. Confessional writing has also influenced other mediums, including the visual arts and reality television.

A highly influential movement, confessional writing has been critiqued as narcissistic, self-indulgent, as well as a violation of the privacy of the private individuals which confessional writers depict.

== Development of the confessional writing genre ==

The confessional writing genre has historical roots in Catholic confessional practices. Works such as St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; and Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; are historic antecedents to the modern confessional genre in their depictions of secret emotions, personal revelations, and of sin.

In the early 20th century, the growth of psychoanalysis increased academic interest in the psychological functions of confession itself. Following their expatriation from wartime continental Europe to the United Kingdom and United States during the Second World War, eminent psychoanalytical theorists including Sigmund Freud, Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, Rudolph Loewenstein, and Ludwig Wittgenstein began to theorise on the defence functions of ego in times of conflict. Wittgenstein expounded on confession as a &#x27;means of self-development,&#x27; in that the catharsis facilitated by the act of confession allowed for closure, and the progression away from both unconscious and conscious suffering: writing in 1931 that &#x27;a confession must be part of your new life.&#x27;

The literary &#x27;confessional&#x27; term was first attributed to a form of writing in 1959: by critic M.L. Rosenthal in response to the confessional poet Robert Lowell&#x27;s seminal anthology &quot;Life Studies&quot;. The anthology is widely regarded as a seminal confessional text, in the poet&#x27;s revelations on his relationship to his parents, marital conflict, depression, and generational trauma. Many Confessional Writers at the time were associated with or worked in American writing schools at institutions such as Boston University. Though the style has since gained global use (See: &quot;Global influence)&quot;, confessional writing emerged in America during the turbulent late 1950s and early 1960s, and was initially characterised by movements away from strictly metred verse to free verse. Following the Second World War, the Holocaust, and during other collective traumas such as the Cold War, American &#x27;cultural alienation&#x27; induced writers to externalise their internal, psychological anxieties and angsts through their literary outputs.

The period was also marked by the secession of Modernism to Postmodernism, the Civil rights movement, the Gay Rights Movement, and the onset of Second Wave Feminism and Postcolonialism. As such, early confessional works, by writers such as Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Dan Guenther, and Robert Lowell encompass personal and social issues including distrust of metanarratives, solipsism, taboos, and the transgression of restrictive social roles.

Contemporary confessional works encompass broader social issues, including drug-use, digital identity, popular culture, and political engagement.

== Key features and notable works ==
Confessional writing is often non-fictive and delivered in direct, first-person narration. Confessional writing usually involves the divulging and discussion of &#x27;shameful matters&#x27;, including personal secrets and controversial perspectives in forms such as autobiography, diary, memoir, and also epistolary narratives. Confessional writing often involves emotions such as shame, fear of ostracism, social discomfort, and disorder; as well as empowerment, self-expression, and liberation.
Owing to the religious connotations of confession, confessional writing is often invocative of religious imagery as reflective of sin and desire. The potential aims of confessional writing include the achievement of closure, catharsis, and the representation of socially marginalised perspectives. Confessional Writing thus also may serve as a literary &#x27;therapeutic outlet.&#x27;

Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot;, an autobiographical suite of poems detailing Lowell&#x27;s upbringing and personal family life, is often regarded as the seminal confessional work. Other important works of confessional writing include Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; of Plath&#x27;s descent into depression and suicide attempts while interning for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine. The novel blends elements of fiction and non-fiction within the parameters of the confessional genre, by representing real people and events through a fictive façade: &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine is replaced with the fictional &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; magazine, and Plath&#x27;s own experience is surrogated by the protagonist, Esther Greenwood&#x27;s perspective. Plath also initially published the novel under the pseudonym, &#x27;Victoria Lucas.&#x27;

More recent works of confessional writing include &quot;Codeine Diary,&quot; by Tom Andrews, a personal account of living with the disease haemophilia; &quot;Girlhood,&quot; by Melissa Febos, an account of the development of the female body from adolescence into adulthood, and of the narrativity of the socially-constructed experience of femininity; &quot;Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion&quot; by &quot;Jia Tolentino&quot;¸ a confessional blend of personal essay and social criticism concerning the rise of the internet during the 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the fallacious digital identities which social media is productive of; &quot;Before I Say Goodbye&quot; by Ruth Picardie, a memoir of her terminal illness with breast cancer; &quot;Bridget Jone&#x27;s Diary&quot; by Helen Fielding, a novel of the love life and entering of middle-age by the titular protagonist through the diary perspective; and &quot;White City Blue&quot; by Tim Lott, a fictive account of the limits and stigmas of male friendship and in adulthood.

== Global influences and iterations ==
Though originating in American literary circles, the confessional writing style has gained global use with the growth of Postcolonial theory and globalisation at the end of the 20th century, especially throughout Eurasia and the Middle East, with focuses on personal intersectionality. Key ideas which global confessional writing explores include globalisation, cultural conflict, and the diasporic experience.

&quot;The Cry of Winnie Mandela&quot;, a novel by Njabulo Ndebele, incorporates stylistic features of the confessional writing genre, including first-person narration and the divulging of personal histories, to critique the Apartheid regime, and to represent the experiences of &#x27;repression suffered by civilians and concealed by colonial occupying forces.

&quot;Sticky Rice Homoeroticism and Queer Politics&quot; by Shinsuke Eguchi blends academic and confessional writing to autoethnographically critique and decolonise perceptions of homosexuality and internalised racism, combining academic elements of theory and criticism with literary and memoir-like representations of personal experience.

Souvankham Thammavongsa&#x27;s poetic anthology &quot;Small Arguments&quot; uses features of confessional writing in a &#x27;subtle probing of the world&#x27; to depict the refugee experience in Canada and concerns of self-determination.

&quot;A Mountainous Journey&quot; by Fadwa Tuqan investigates the struggles of the Palestinian people, through a confessional, intimate perspective, to challenge the patriarchal and colonial hegemonies which problematise the endurance of her people, and the place of women in Islamic society.

&quot;Beirut Blues&quot; by Hanan al-Shaykh explores war-torn Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War, from the perspective of the young female narrator in confessional modes, including epistolary narratives.

== Influences on other media ==
Confessional writing features and styles have translated into and influenced other non-literary forms: especially in contemporary art through the use of prominent confessional features such as the divulsion of personal secrets and the presentation of intimate and sometimes scandalous details of the artist&#x27;s private lives.

&quot;My Bed&quot; is a confessional artwork by Tracey Emin: depicting a dishevelled bed stained with bodily secretions and surrounded by personal effects including empty vodka bottles, condoms, and menstrual-blood-stained undergarments. The artwork caused public outcry and controversy: employing features of the confessional style — including the presentation of intimate personal effects and socially taboo objects —in challenging the acceptable limits of personal and artistic representation.

French artist Louise Bourgeois also explored elements of confessional writing throughout her body of work, especially through representing her relationships with family members. Bourgeois&#x27; 1974 tableau &quot;The Destruction of the Father&quot; psychologically explored the artist&#x27;s relationship to her father through biomorphic and phallic objects, presented in a crime-scene scenario – the implication being that the child has cannibalised their overbearing father. The spider motif throughout Bourgeois&#x27; art, including in the &quot;Maman&quot; sculpture series, alludes to Bourgeois&#x27; relationship to her mother, and the nourishment and protection it was productive of.

Candy Cheng&#x27;s art installation &quot;Confessions,&quot; which has been exhibited across America, Central and Eastern Europe, invited viewers and members of the public to write anonymous confessions onto a wooden board and hang their confession on the work itself, with emphasis on features typical to the confessional writing genre including the catharsis of the act of confession, and the desire to reveal secrets.

&quot;Fun Home&quot; and &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; are both memoirs by American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, which incorporate features of confessional writing through the graphic novel medium.

Academics have also expounded on the self-performativity and confession-based format of reality television shows such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; as having roots in the confessional writing genre. Critics have likewise highlighted the ubiquity of confessional &#x27;self-disclosure&#x27; in the public domains of social media and the internet, and how twenty-first century technologies are supplanting the traditional distinctions between an individual&#x27;s public life and private self.

== Criticisms of the confessional writing genre ==

A highly influential movement, confessional writing has been critiqued as narcissistic, self-indulgent, as well as a violation of the privacy of the private individuals which confessional writers depict. Owing to the exclusively heterosexual and upper-class White Anglo-Saxon Protestantism which characterises many of the early confessional writers, such as Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath, the mode has been critiqued as solipsistic, &#x27;classist, self assured, and elusive,&#x27; as well as lacking diverse social and cultural perspectives.

Further, theorist Michel Foucault explicated that confession, as an act inherent to the social structures of law, medicine, and faith, is a consolidated act of social oppression: confining subjects within traditional hegemonies of shame, guilt, and socially-constructed requirements of forgiveness.

Feminist discourse is separated on the mode: whilst some theorists regard the depiction of issues such as sexual violence, eating disorders, and mental illness by female confessional writers as liberating, others view it as voyeuristic and objectifying.

The New Formalism school of writing, a movement of the late 20th century which emphasised returns to formulaic and strictly metrical poetry, was formed in direct response to the dominance of confessional styles of poetry which were characterised by unfixed structures and free verse, forms denigrated by the school as lacking finesse and craft.

<text>The FIFA U-20 World Cup is the biennial football world championship tournament for FIFA members’ men&#x27;s national teams with players under the age of 20. The competition has been staged every two years since the inaugural tournament in 1977 when it was hosted by Tunisia under the tournament name of FIFA World Youth Championship until 2005. In 2007 the name was changed to its present form. FIFA bills the men&#x27;s Under-20 World Cup as &quot;the tournament of tomorrow&#x27;s superstars.&quot; Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba are previous winners of the official player of the tournament award, and Erling Haaland was the top scorer at the 2019 edition. The current title holder is Uruguay, which won its first title at the 2023 tournament in Argentina.

== History ==
In the twenty-three editions of the tournament held, twelve nations have won the title. Argentina U20 is the most successful team with six titles, followed by Brazil U20 with five titles. Portugal U20 and Serbia U20 have both won two titles (with the latter winning once as Yugoslavia U20), while Ghana U20, Germany U20, Spain U20, France U20, England U20, Ukraine U20, Russia U20 (as the USSR U20) and Uruguay U20 have won the title once each.

A corresponding event for women&#x27;s teams, the FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup, began in 2002 with the name &quot;FIFA U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship&quot; and an age limit of 19. The age limit for the women&#x27;s competition was changed to 20 beginning with the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Championship, and the competition was renamed as a &quot;World Cup&quot; in 2007 in preparation for the 2008 event. The next edition is planned to be held in 2025 in Chile.

==Qualification==
24 national teams appear in the final tournament. 23 countries, including the defending champion, have to qualify in the youth championships of the six confederations. The host country automatically qualifies.

==Results==


==Teams reaching the top four==
:1 = &quot;includes results representing Yugoslavia&quot;
:2 = &quot;includes results representing USSR&quot;
:3 = &quot;includes results representing West Germany&quot;
===Performances by continental zones (as of 2023)===

All continental confederations except for the OFC (Oceania) have made an appearance in the final match of the tournament. To date, CONMEBOL (South America) leads with twelve titles, followed by UEFA (Europe) with ten titles and CAF (Africa) with one title. Teams from the AFC (Asia) and CONCACAF (North America, Central America, Caribbean) have made the tournament final four times, but were defeated by strong UEFA sides. No current OFC member has ever made the semifinals; Australia reached the semifinals as an OFC member in 1991 and 1993, finishing fourth on both occasions, before the country joined the AFC in 2006.

:1 = &quot;as Yugoslavia (1987).&quot;

<doc id="1168198" wikidata="Q7170569" url="?curid=1168198" title="Personal consumption expenditures price index">
<text>The PCE price index (PePP), also referred to as the PCE deflator, PCE price deflator, or the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures (IPD for PCE) by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and as the Chain-type Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (CTPIPCE) by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. It is benchmarked to a base of 2012 = 100. Using a variety of data including U.S. Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index prices, it is derived from the largest component of the GDP in the BEA&#x27;s National Income and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures.

The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) measure is the component statistic for consumption in gross domestic product (GDP) collected by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). It consists of the actual and imputed expenditures of households and includes data pertaining to durable and non-durable goods and services. Essentially, it is a measure of goods and services targeted towards individuals and consumed by individuals. The less volatile measure of the PCE price index is the core PCE (CPCE) price index, which excludes the more volatile and seasonal food and energy prices (e.g., oil, natural gas, and electricity).

In comparison to the headline United States Consumer Price Index (CPI), which uses one set of expenditure weights for several years, this index uses a Fisher Price Index, which uses expenditure data from only the current period and the preceding period. Also, the PCEPI uses a chained index which compares one quarter&#x27;s price to the previous quarter&#x27;s instead of using a fixed base. This price index method assumes that the consumer has made allowances for changes in relative prices. That is to say, they have substituted from goods whose prices are rising to goods whose prices are stable or falling.

PCE has been tracked since January 1959. Through July 2018, inflation measured by PCE has averaged 3.3%, while it has averaged 3.8% using CPI. This may be due to the failure of CPI to take into account the substitution effect. Alternatively, an unpublished report on this difference by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that most of it is from different ways of calculating hospital expenses and airfares.

PCE data is published monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA).

==Federal Reserve==
In its &quot;Monetary Policy Report to the Congress&quot; (&quot;Humphrey–Hawkins Report&quot;) from February 17, 2000 the FOMC said it was changing its primary measure of inflation from the consumer price index to the &quot;chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures&quot;.

==Comparison to CPI==

The differences between the two indexes can be grouped into four categories: formula effect, weight effect, scope effect, and &quot;other effects&quot;.

*The formula effect accounts for the different formulas used to calculate the two indexes. The PCE price index is based on the Fisher-Ideal formula, while the CPI is based on a modified Laspeyres formula.
*The weight effect accounts for the relative importance of the underlying commodities reflected in the construction of the two indexes.
*The scope effect accounts for conceptual differences between the two indexes. PCE measures spending by and on behalf of the personal sector, which includes both households and nonprofit institutions serving households; the CPI measures out-of-pocket spending by households. The &quot;net&quot; scope effect adjusts for CPI items out-of-scope of the PCE price index less items in the PCE price index that are out-of-scope of the CPI.
*&quot;Other effects&quot; include seasonal adjustment differences, price differences, and residual differences.

The above chart is illustrative but may not reflect current values. The comparisons in the table above will vary over time as the relative weights of the components of the indexes change. The CPI base price and weightings are adjusted every two years.

The above table illustrates two commonly discussed important differences between the PCE deflator and CPI-U. The first major difference is the relative importance of housing, which is due in part to the difference in scope mentioned above. CPI contains a large component of owner-equivalent rent, which by definition is an imputed value and not a real direct expenditure. The second major difference in weight is healthcare. This again stems from the definition of the index and the surveys used. CPI measures only the out-of-pocket healthcare costs of households, while PCE includes healthcare purchased on behalf of households by third parties, including employer-provided health insurance. In the United States, employer health insurance is a large component and accounts for much of the difference in weights.

Another notable difference is that prices and weightings of the CPI are based on household surveys, while those of the PCE are based on business surveys. One reason for the difference in formulas is that not all the data needed for the Fisher-Ideal formula is available monthly even though it is considered superior. CPI is a practical alternative used to give a quicker read on prices in the previous month. PCE is typically revised three times in each of the months following the end of a quarter, and then the entire NIPA tables are re-based annually and every five years. Despite all these conceptual and methodological differences, the two indexes track fairly closely when averaged over several years.

<text>The Theatre Royal is a historic theatre, a Grade I listed building situated on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne.

==History==
The theatre was designed by local architects John and Benjamin Green as part of Richard Grainger&#x27;s grand design for the centre of Newcastle, and was opened on 20 February 1837 with a performance of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. One of the first managers here was Thomas Ternan who employed his wife, Frances Ternan as the main actress.

The shareholders of the Proprietors&#x27; Committee appointed lessees to manage and programme the theatre. The longest running individual lessee, before Ltd companies, was Edward D. Davis from 1845 to 1870 during which in 1867 the interior was redesigned by architect Charles J. Phipps. William Glover and George Francis, both of the Theatre Royal, Glasgow took over from 1871 to 1878; to be followed by Charles Bernard of the Gaiety Theatre, Glasgow until 1882. James Howard and Fred Wyndham of Edinburgh and Glasgow became lessees from 1883 to 1887. Due to their intention, carried out, of also leasing the Tyne Theatre and Opera House, the shareholder committee did not renew their lease of the Royal.

Instead, Robert Arthur of Glasgow and now lessee of Her Majesty’s Theatre, Dundee took over in 1888. 

Following a performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1899, a huge fire destroyed the interior of the building in 1899. The interior was redesigned by Frank Matcham and reopened on 31 December 1901. Externally, the building is exactly as it was when it was first built.

The venues of Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd in Scotland and England, which had many shareholders in Tyneside, prospered until losses overwhelmed the company in 1911. At this point the Arthur shareholders, led by the family of Joseph Cowen MP, appointed a new chairman of the lessee company, Michael Simons, of Glasgow, who in 1895 had created Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd.

From 1912 onwards the Theatre Royal Newcastle was an important part of the Howard &amp; Wyndham group, led successfully by chairman Simons, followed by the Cruikshank family, whose King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh joined the group in 1928. Newcastle City Council took over ownership in 1967.

Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh formed a triangle of industry, commerce and entertainment business from the 1870s onwards. From 1962 and increasingly from the 1970s the interchange of shows and pantomimes was joined by tours each year of Scottish Opera and of Scottish Ballet. Opera North joined in.
It underwent a major refurbishment and restoration in the latter part of the 1980s, reopening on 11 January 1988 with a performance of &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; starring Charlton Heston.

The Theatre Royal went dark on 14 March 2011 due to a major restoration of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats in keeping with the restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes at the rear of the grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett&#x27;s epic period drama &quot;The Madness of George III&quot;; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.

The theatre currently hosts a variety of shows, including ballet, contemporary dance, drama, musicals and opera. Almost all of the shows that come to the Theatre Royal are part of national British tours, and in a typical year the theatre will have 30 to 35 visiting shows. For the annual pantomime, and any visiting musicals and opera performances, there is a sizeable orchestra pit available which can seat 60 musicians if necessary. The stage itself is also of substantial size, and can house 50 singers, dancers, actors and musicians.

==The Original Theatre Royal==
Newcastle&#x27;s original Theatre Royal opened on 21 January 1788. Its location on Mosley Street obstructed plans for the redevelopment of the city centre (as it was on the route of Grey Street), so it was demolished to make way for the present building. One of the theatre&#x27;s most successful managers at this time was Stephen Kemble of the famous Kemble family, who managed the theatre from 1791 to 1806. The original theatre&#x27;s final performance was on 25 June 1836.

==Technical details==
The current theatre has a proscenium stage, and accommodates a variable orchestra pit on 2 lifts, which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247).

==Project A==
Project A is a one-year actor training programme led by an artistic director and supported by leading industry specialists. Delivered from within the Theatre Royal over an academic year (3 terms) participants gain professional standard actor training culminating in a production term to be performed in the Studio Theatre and toured nationally.

The course started in September 2015 with the first year free for the successful actors. The programme is seen as an alternative to drama school and is expected to lift the actors involved into the industry.

The Royal Shakespeare Company have very strong ties to the theatre and are involved with the programme heavily in the second term.

<text>The second USS &quot;Marblehead&quot; (C-11/PG-27) was a &quot;Montgomery&quot;-class unprotected cruiser in the United States Navy, authorized in the naval appropriations bill of September 7, 1888. &quot;Marblehead&quot; served in the Spanish–American War and World War I, and was the last ship of her class in service.

&quot;Marblehead&quot; was laid down in October 1890 by City Point Iron Works, Boston, Massachusetts; launched 11 August 1892; sponsored by Mrs. C. F. Allen; and commissioned 2 April 1894, Commander Charles O&#x27;Neil in command. She was named for the seaport Marblehead, Massachusetts.

==Service history==

===Pre-Spanish–American War===
Assigned to the North Atlantic Station, &quot;Marblehead&quot; departed New York 6 June 1894, for the Caribbean in response to a change of government in Nicaragua. The ship arrived in port 19 June at Bluefields and found that city to be the point of greatest danger. On 7 July, in response to dispatches from the American consul, she put ashore a landing party of Marines and bluejackets to protect American interests. Reinforced by a second party 31 July, this force remained ashore until 7 August. Five days later, &quot;Marblehead&quot; departed Bluefields to continue cruising the Caribbean, showing the flag in Latin American waters until 26 November, when she departed Port Royal, Jamaica, for Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on 6 December.

The cruiser stood out from Norfolk 4 March 1895, for duty on the European Station. Sailing via the Azores, the ship arrived at Gibraltar 31 March. During April and May, she cruised the Mediterranean, spending much time on patrol in Syrian waters, and then steamed for Germany to represent the U.S. at the 20 June opening of the Kiel Canal. For the next five months, the ship cruised along the coast of western Europe and in the Mediterranean steaming over and visiting more than 40 foreign ports. &quot;Marblehead&quot; then returned to the U.S., anchoring at Tompkinsville, New York 23 November 1896. On 1 February 1897, the ship was again assigned to the North Atlantic Station, and for the remainder of the year cruised the east coast and the Caribbean in training.

===Spanish–American War===
At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;Marblehead&quot; was at Key West, Florida. Immediately sailing for Cuban waters, she arrived off Havana 23 April 1898, and then proceeded to Cienfuegos where she shelled enemy vessels and fortifications on 29 April, in support of the invasion of Guantánamo Bay. After joining the blockading squadron, she cut the cables off Cienfuegos on 11 May, when many of her sailors and Marines received Medals of Honor, including seaman Anton Olsen.

She then patrolled off Santiago de Cuba until early June. In company with the auxiliary cruiser , &quot;Marblehead&quot; captured the lower part of Guantánamo Bay as a base for the fleet 7 June, and supported the landing of a battalion of Marines there three days later. Continuing operations in the bay, she helped the pre-dreadnought battleship destroy the Spanish fort on Cayo del Toro on 15 June.

On July 26 and 27 she assisted in the clearing of 27 contact mines from Guantanamo Bay, for which three of her crew members, Chief Carpenter&#x27;s Mate Axel Sundquist, Boatswains Mate Second Class William H. Morin and Ordinary Seaman Samuel Triplett, received the Medal of Honor.

The ship remained in Cuban waters until 2 September, when she sailed for the St. Lawrence River on 20 October to participate in ceremonies opening the Champlain Monument in Quebec.

===Pre–World War I===
&quot;Marblehead&quot; repaired at Boston Navy Yard from 2 November 1898 to 9 February 1899, and, following a brief cruise to the Caribbean, proceeded through the Straits of Magellan 16 June to join the Pacific Squadron on 4 July. She cruised off the coast of South America, Mexico, and California until she decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard, 30 April 1900.

She was recommissioned 10 November 1902, to devote the next four years to cruising along the west coast of North and South America, from Alaska to Chile on training and protocol missions. On 9 January 1903 she collided with in San Francisco Bay in dense fog, doing $2,500 in damage to Pomona. From October 1903 to March 1904, she served as flagship of Rear Admiral Henry Glass, Commander of the Pacific Squadron. The cruiser decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard 1 October 1906, and remained at the yard until 31 March 1910, when she was loaned to the California Naval Militia as a training ship. She was placed in commission in reserve, 22 July 1911, and in 1916 was turned over to the Oregon Naval Militia as training ship for that state.

===World War I===
&quot;Marblehead&quot; was again placed in full commission 6 April 1917, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, and 4 May was ordered to the Pacific Patrol Force. She was employed on convoy, patrol, and survey duty, operating off Mexico and in search of possible German raiders in the California area until 11 June 1918, when she proceeded via the Panama Canal to Key West for duty with the American patrol detachment. Arriving at Key West 22 June, the ship spent the remainder of World War I in the Caribbean, engaged in escort and patrol duty. Detached from patrol duty 4 December, the cruiser steamed to join Division 2, Pacific Fleet. She arrived Mare Island 17 February 1919, and decommissioned 21 August. Reclassified PG-27 in July 1920, &quot;Marblehead&quot; was sold 5 August 1921.

<doc id="1168217" wikidata="Q7853010" url="?curid=1168217" title="Tung Wah Group of Hospitals">
<text>The Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (), with a history dating back to 1870, is the oldest and largest charitable organisation in Hong Kong. It provides extensive education and community services through 194 service centres spread across Hong Kong.

Although Tung Wah Group of Hospitals is purely a charitable organisation today, it was originally an organisation that brought together the most influential Chinese magnates of Hong Kong in early colonial period. Tung Wah Group of Hospitals is also responsible for the management of Man Mo Temple, once an important cultural centre of colonial Hong Kong.

Tung Wah Group of Hospitals&#x27; Gallery, can be found in Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences, exhibits antiques of the charitable organisation. Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Museum, also managed by Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, is located inside Kwong Wah Hospital.

== Name origin ==

The Chinese name of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (東華三院) ,literally translated, means three hospitals of Eastern China. The three hospitals are Tung Wah Hospital (1890), Kwong Wah Hospital (1911) and Tung Wah Eastern Hospital (1929), all were founded by local Chinese. They formed a group in 1931, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals.

==Board of directors==
The Board of Directors of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals is responsible for ensuring the charitable organization is properly maintained. All board appointments require consent of Government of Hong Kong.

The incumbent chairman of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, Lee Yuk-lun, took office on 6 April 2017, succeeding his predecessor, Katherine Ma.

Five hospitals are under the umbrella of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, including Tung Wah Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Wong Tai Sin Hospital and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Fung Yiu King Hospital, providing a total of 2,652 hospital beds . It is Tung Wah&#x27;s policy to provide at least 600 beds free of charge, of which 200 may be funded by the government.

TWGH also operates nursing home services for the elderly:

* Jockey Club Sunshine Complex for the Elderly - at the old Nam Long Hospital site

== School of Nursing ==
Providing competent nurse education has been a mission of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals since 1964, when nursing schools of Tung Wah Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital and Tung Wah Eastern Hospital were merged. With the expansion of Kwong Wah Hospital, where the merged nursing school was settled, more students were admitted to its nursing school. Three classes, with a total of over 210 students, were commenced every year. Rebecca Chan Chung (鍾陳可慰), a United States Army nurse in China during World War II and author of &quot;Piloted to Serve&quot;, had supervised the nursing school from 1964 to 1975.

== Education Division ==
The group operates 52 schools in Hong Kong, including one degree granting tertiary institution, 18 secondary schools, 17 primary schools, 15 kindergartens and two schools for the mentally handicapped.

<doc id="1168220" wikidata="Q470954" url="?curid=1168220" title="Władysław Grabski">
<text>Władysław Dominik Grabski (; 7 July 1874 – 1 March 1938) was a Polish National Democratic politician, economist and historian. He was the main author of the currency reform in the Second Polish Republic and served as Prime Minister of Poland in 1920 and from 1923 to 1925. He was the brother of Stanisław Grabski and Zofia Kirkor-Kiedroniowa.

He was responsible for the creation of the Bank of Poland and implementing the zloty. Grabski&#x27;s cabinet became the longest-standing cabinet in interwar Poland. At the same time, however, Grabski&#x27;s cabinet was severely criticized. Stanisław Głąbiński, for example, criticized Grabski&#x27;s inefficiencies in the sphere of international relations, and Wincenty Witos disapproved of Grabski&#x27;s deficient agricultural reform, as well as his inability to inform the public of the state&#x27;s real financial situation.

==Life==

Władysław Grabski was born in 1874, in a family manor in Borów (a part of Gmina Bielawy) near Łowicz, Congress Poland, Russian Empire. He studied politics at the &quot;École Libre des Sciences Politiques&quot; (today: Sciences Po) and history at the University of Sorbonne. While in Paris, Grabski&#x27;s political views changed. He abandoned the socialist ideas and turned more towards the right.
The years Władysław Grabski had spent in Paris became an impetus behind Grabski&#x27;s desire for his involvement in the Polish government. Soon after Grabski&#x27;s return from Paris, in 1905, he founded the Agricultural Society in Łowicz, in central Poland. The Society quickly won the support of many peasants, which in turn led to the creation of the National Labor Union. 

Due to the growing autonomy and strength of Grabski&#x27;s Agricultural Society and the Union, in 1905, Grabski was arrested by the Russian authorities and imprisoned in Warsaw. Grabski&#x27;s imprisonment, however, lasted less than a year. In 1905, Grabski was elected on behalf of National Democracy as a member of three successive sessions of the Duma, the legislative assembly of the Russian Empire. He was a deputy in Duma until 1912. It was at that time that he became involved in the work of the budgetary commission with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture. Grabski&#x27;s involvement in the budgetary Commission became a reason for his later desire to become the finance minister in the Polish parliament. 

When World War I broke out, he organized the Central Citizens&#x27; Committee, which was responsible for restoring order into the life of a society devastated by the Polish partitions, and to represent the interests of Polish people before the Russian authorities. He also became a member of the Polish National Committee. In 1919, he entered the government of the newly restored Poland as Minister of Agriculture.

Grabski&#x27;s influence on Polish affairs increased when he became Treasury Minister and Prime Minister in 1920. However, his first cabinet lasted for only one month. In December 1923, he was again appointed Prime Minister and served as Treasury Minister in a specialist cabinet (appointed by but not necessarily composed of elected parliamentary representatives). Grabski managed to implement reforms that alleviated Poland&#x27;s economic situation and managed to preserve his cabinet for twenty-three months, a relatively long period for a Polish cabinet in interwar Poland. Until the end of 1924, Grabski&#x27;s government enjoyed great popularity.

Yet Grabski remained a controversial figure for the twenty-three months he remained in office. Stanisław Głąbiński, for example, argued that in the sphere of foreign relations, Grabski did not show the desired assertiveness. At the League of Nations conference, Grabski did not mention the League&#x27;s unresponsiveness to the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1921. According to the tenth article of the treaty of Versailles, &quot;The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League&quot;. However, the League of Nations remained aloof and impassive in 1920. 

Grabski&#x27;s decision not to raise the issue of the League&#x27;s lack of action resulted in severe criticism from the Polish parliament. Głąbiński was not the only critic of Grabski&#x27;s cabinet. Wincenty Witos criticized Grabski for his excessively optimistic attitude regarding the financial reforms and so did others; nevertheless, the reform stopped the hyperinflation in its tracks.

On 13 November 1925 Grabski was forced to resign following a disagreement with the President of the Bank of Poland, who refused to help him with the backing of the industrialist &#x27;Lewiatan&#x27; organization.

=== Currency reform ===
Grabski&#x27;s (and the ministerial cabinet&#x27;s) great achievement in those years was the foundation of the Bank of Poland and the creation of the new Polish currency – the gold-based zloty which replaced the Polish mark. The Act of 11 January 1924 on the improvement of the state&#x27;s treasury and currency reform introduced a new monetary system and established the issuing bank. The Bank of Poland was founded as a joint stock company, which was supposed to guarantee its &#x27;independence&#x27; from the government and the state treasury. The Act also abolished the Polish National Savings Union which had acted as an issuing bank. Its functions were taken over by the Bank of Poland. Stanisław Karpiński became the first president of the Bank of Poland. On 14 January, the organizing committee of the Bank of Poland was established, and, on 26 January, the sale of the bank&#x27;s shares began. Payments could only be made in foreign currencies and in gold. On 15 April, during the first shareholders&#x27; meeting, the Bank of Poland Joint Stock Company was established.

Grabski went further than just establishing the Bank of Poland and the currency. He built a network of state banks and founded the Bank for National Economy. He also initiated far-going changes in the structure of Polish exports and industrial output. He also established the Border Defence Corps.

Nevertheless, criticism continued over aspects of Grabski&#x27;s reforms. In 1925, Grabski himself commented that he was too optimistic about his economic reforms and that he should have realized that given the circumstances of depression and the recuperation from World War I, a complete recovery of the Polish economy was virtually impossible. There were enormous price discrepancies between agricultural and manufactured goods. The Bank of Poland was faced with both a commercial deficit and an increasing national debt. 

The government made numerous unfavourable investments and in 1925, the Sejm approved a proposal for an excessively high budget, despite frequent warnings from Grabski&#x27;s cabinet. On 29 July 1925, the value of the Polish złoty declined significantly. A tariff war broke out between Poland and Germany. Grabski resigned from his post in active politics in November of that year. He subsequently devoted himself to pedagogic and academic work at the Warsaw Agricultural University (SGGW). In 1926, he became its rector. In 1936 on his motion the Rural Sociology Institute was established, of which he remained the head until his death in 1938.

Władysław Grabski died from cancer on 1 March 1938 in Warsaw. The Holy Mass was led by Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski in the Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral. His body was interred in the family grave at the Powązki Cemetery.

== Perception among Polish Jews ==

Between 1924 and 1926, mass emigration of Polish Jews to Palestine took place following the economic restrictions placed on Jews in Poland. This wave of Jewish migration became known as &quot;Grabski&#x27;s Aliyah&quot; (Aliyah being the traditional Hebrew word for immigration to the Land of Israel) owing to the financial reforms conducted by Władysław Grabski at that time. In American Jewish media sources, Grabski&#x27;s reforms were described as &quot;an anti-Jewish taxation policy so severe that it resulted in a great immigration movement to Palestine, known as &#x27;the Grasski Aliyah.&#x27;&quot;

Scholars assessing the Grabski financial reforms note how the introduction of new finance policies strengthened political institutions. In the case of the 1924-25 reform program, fundamental changes were made to taxation policy and led to the increase of direct taxation that required increased state-citizen interactions. One effect of these reforms was that the state gathered extensive information on business activities and demanded taxation payments. The enactment of these policies was not without consequence as many citizens, especially Jewish merchants, perceived the reform as an unfair reform that demanded undue levels of taxation.

== Legacy ==
In 2004, Poland celebrated the 130th anniversary of Władyslaw Grabski&#x27;s birthday and the 80th anniversary of the public finance reforms he introduced. In September 2003, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland passed a resolution proclaiming 2004 as Władyslaw Grabski&#x27;s Year. 

In 2004, a statue was unveiled in his birthplace village of Borów. 

The Warsaw Agricultural University labelled him as a &quot;great Pole, great statesman, social activist and a man of great heart and mind, one of the brightest Poles of the interwar period&quot;. 

In July 2006, the newly opened Main Library of the Warsaw Agricultural University was named after Grabski, and in front of the library, the statue of Grabski was placed. 

His grandson, Andrzej Feliks Grabski (1934–2000), became a historian.

<doc id="1168225" wikidata="Q197913" url="?curid=1168225" title="Zhongshan (state)">
<text>Zhongshan () was a small state that existed during the Warring States period, which managed to survive for almost 120 years despite its small size. The origins of its founder are a matter of contention between scholars.

==Origins==
The origin of the Zhongshan state is disputed; some sources, such as the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, label the state as being founded and ruled by Beidi (北狄), while others only list them as not being Zhou or Han. Zhongshan occupies roughly the same place as the earlier Xianyu state. The two countries, being Zhongshan and Xianyu, have a muddled history, as the term Zhongshan begins somewhat before the term Xianyu ends. Zhongshan, meaning central mountains, is first mentioned in 506BC, by a Jin minister, as a hostile neighboring state. The last mention of the Xianyu, meanwhile, is in 489BC, when Zhao Yang, a Jin minister, leads a military campaign against them.

There are three reasons Zhongshan is often considered a continuation of Xianyu: Both had similar relationships with Qi and Jin, the two states were located in almost exactly the same place, and there is no historical record of Xianyu being conquered. It is considered possible that the name change marks a transition from a loosely-controlled confederation of Di tribes, to a more centralized state. One challenge to this theory of continuation is that after Zhongshan was conquered in 407-406, by the state of Wei, Marquess Wen of Wei gave the land to his eldest son Ji, and the state was based upon this. However this theory is contradicted by a line of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, in which it states that the new state of Zhongshan came some time after this. Some theories postulate that this new state was a continuation of the earlier Xianyu, and others saying the ruling family of the new Zhongshan came from a line of the Zhou. Because of this, there is no definitive answer as to the ethnicity of Zhongshan, or even to the ethnicity of the royal family; however, it is known that the country&#x27;s population was mixed.

==History==
The first major event of Zhongshan was the capital being placed at Gu, in 414BC, during the reign of Duke Wu, traditionally considered the founding of the country itself. Soon after this, in 407, Zhongshan was conquered by Wei troops, led by general Yue Yang. It is said that Yue Yang&#x27;s son was living in Zhongshan when war was declared, and was taken hostage. He was paraded before Yue Yang in order to weaken morale, but when this failed, they killed his son and made him into stew, before sending part of said stew to Yue Yang, which he drank in front of the Zhongshan messenger to show resolve. Shortly after, in 381, Zhongshan won its independence back.

Zhongshan invaded Yan in 315, after Yan&#x27;s king, Zi Kuai, abdicated his throne to his chancellor, Zi Zhi. Qi and Zhongshan both separately invaded Yan. Zhongshan seized copper mines in this war, which had previously belonged to the Donghu, but which had been taken by Yan in war. Zhongshan&#x27;s troops were led by Sima Zhou.

In 306, after the state of Zhao, under King Wuling of Zhao, finished a military reform, adopting the uniforms and tactics of the Hu nomads, they invaded Zhongshan. After ten years of war Zhao annexed them in 296.

==Foreign relations==
Zhongshan was unusual in that despite being such a small nation, it managed to survive for a long time, considering that many countries, large and small, of the Warring States period lived very short lifespans. Guo Songtao credits this to shrewd diplomacy, saying: &quot;In the rises and falls of the Warring States, Zhongshan seems to be the unnoticed hub and lynchpin.&quot; Despite their small size, they demonstrated impressive resilience and strength; they are the only small nation to be given their own chapter in the &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;.

In 323BC, Zhongshan formed a vertical alliance, allying itself with Wei, Han, Zhao, and Yan, in order to defend themselves against larger states like Qin, Qi, and &quot;Chu&quot;. This alliance allowed the states in it to claim the title of &quot;wang&quot; (a title roughly equivalent to King). King Wei of Qi, who had 11 years earlier taken the title of &quot;wang&quot; for himself, objected to this, saying: &quot;I am ashamed to be a king[,] if the ruler of Zhongshan can be one too&quot;. He later went on to say: &quot;I am a state of ten thousand chariots and Zhongshan is one of a thousand chariots, how dare she [Zhongshan] assume a title the equal of mine?&quot;. An important part of this statement can be seen in his reason for denouncing them claiming kingship is not that they were non-Chinese (&quot;Huaxi&quot;), which would very likely have been mentioned in the insult if it were true. The fact that Zhongshan was invited to the five state alliance is seen as another proof of them being Chinese, as a barbarian (&quot;Yi&quot;) country would never be invited to such an alliance. After this, King Wei of Qi asked Wei and Zhao to join him in attacking Zhongshan, to force them to abolish their title of &quot;wang&quot;, however, King Cuo sent an advisor, Zhang Deng, to these states, and successfully sowed discord and distrust amongst them, and no such alliance was formed.

===Zhao===
The state of Zhao surrounded Zhongshan almost entirely, with only Zhongshan&#x27;s northeastern border being outside of &quot;Zhao&quot;. For this reason, they were considered to be a &quot;disease in the heart and belly&quot; by the Zhao kings. From 307 BC on, Zhao attacked Zhongshan almost every year, until, in 301, the king of Zhongshan was forced to take refuge in Qi. During this time Qi declared war on and invaded Chu; seeing that Qi was occupied with a war of their own, Zhao pushed deep into Zhongshan, and fully conquered them.

==Economy==
Due to commonality of finds of iron agricultural tools in the southern part of Zhongshan, compared to the commonality of animal skeletons in the northern part, it is believed that the southern land&#x27;s economy was mostly agriculture, and the northern land&#x27;s was mostly from animal husbandry.

===Currency===
Zhongshan used a currency called &quot;chengbo&quot;, which took the form of a 15 gram bronze knife shaped coin. It is known that these coins were made in at least Lingshou.

The level of trade, and the relationship, Zhongshan had with other states can be roughly ascertained from the amount of a currency was found in the ruins of Lingshou: the &quot;yan&quot; knife coins from Yan were plentiful, with some 374 being found, whereas the &quot;gandan&quot;, &quot;baihua&quot;, and &quot;lin&quot; coins of Zhao are rare, with only 100 of them, combined, found. This reflects the hostile relations Zhao had with Zhongshan, and the good relations Yan had with Zhongshan. Indeed, even the similarities of the &quot;yan&quot; and &quot;chengbo&quot; knife coins seems to suggest their friendly relationship, as they were of similar size and of equal weight, with both weighing fifteen grams, meaning that they would be interchangeable.

==Archeology and culture==
Much of the knowledge of Zhongshan architecture comes from the remains of their capital city, &quot;Lingshou&quot;, and from the tombs of King Cheng, and his son King Cuo. In the late 1970s, the tombs of both kings were found in Pingshan County, Hebei, and the capital city was found shortly after, in 1976, only a mile to the east of King Cuo&#x27;s tomb.

===Tombs===

The tombs of the two kings, Cheng and Cuo, were the first find of any Zhongshan architecture, and are considered the richest find of any Chinese state of the 4th century BC. They are the largest of any tombs of the Zhongshan to date. Both of their main chambers had been looted, however their storage chambers were still intact, and contained a large number of artifacts. Many of these ritual vessels found in these tombs were from surrounding warring states, with a few coming from the northern nomads, but the luxury goods were largely of the Zhongshan style. This split, between archeological evidence supporting the thesis that they were a Chinese people (&quot;Huaxia&quot;), and textual sources claiming them as a non-Chinese people, has caused two fields of thought; one side seeing the Zhongshan as a sinicized minority, an outside group that has been heavily influenced by Chinese culture, and the other seeing them as a Chinese people that were influenced by non-Chinese, nomadic peoples.

===Cities===
The capital city, Lingshou contained many ruins, including the foundations of palaces, workshops for bronze and ceramic, marketplaces, and cemeteries. The cemeteries around Lingshou contain some 125 tombs, and dozens more are scattered throughout the country. The city is believed to have been founded in 380, and to have remained the capital until 296, when Zhongshan was conquered. The city is strategically placed, surrounded on its west, north and south sides by the Taihang Mountains, with its east side facing plains. Like many other capitals of the time, the city was built at the confluence of two rivers. The city was about wide east to west, and wide north to south. Of the cities walls, only the earthen foundation remains, but it is known that they ranged between being and wide. Two gates can be seen, one on the west side and the other on the north side. Four pounded-earth terraces were attached to the walls, some near the gates. A small hill, called Huangshan, is inside the walls, in the north section of the city. The &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; says that this hill is what gives the Zhongshan, meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;, their name. The hill is believed to have been used as a watchtower. For further fortification, a small city was built to the east. This small city/fort was by . The remains of the pounded earth and buildings of the centre-western part still stand. This city was used to defend the only angle from which to attack Lingshou, which was clearly placed based upon military considerations, rather than economic or political.

===Social classes===
The official that was in charge of managing the tile-making workers in pottery workshops was called a Sikou. The &quot;Zhouli&quot; describes Sikou to mean an officer in charge of penal codes and convicts, suggesting that Zhongshan&#x27;s tile production was reliant on, at least in part, convict labor.

===Religion===
The ideology of Zhongshan was heavily influenced by Confucian ideals, but it is believed that these ideals were used by the King to legitimize his rule, and his foreign policy, rather than being truly believed by the ruling class. This can be seen in their use of Confucian ideology regarding the ruler being heavenly mandated, in order to attack Yan, and seize cities and materials.

A key religious area, Guocun, was located some 4 kilometers southwest of Lingshou, and contained 142 sacrificial pits. These pits were roughly by in area, and between and deep. In each of these pits, an animal, usually sheep, goats, or cattle, was found with its legs tied together, and was buried with a jade item, usually a pendant or &quot;bi&quot; disk. These pits, and their contents, are very similar to the sacrificial pits of Jin, where they are believed to have been used ceremonially, to form &quot;oaths of alliances&quot; (&quot;mengshi&quot;). The connection of the two has been seen as evidence of a strong Jin cultural influence upon the elites of Zhongshan.

===Language===
The characters and style of Zhongshan Chinese is closest to the Chinese of the Qi, but was also influenced by the more southern Chinese states. Their style of calligraphy were very slender and graceful, while also being very taut. It is believed that this style of calligraphy was chosen by King Cuo himself, to emphasize his power.

==Military==
According to the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; the soldiers of Zhongshan wore iron armor, and wielded iron staffs. They were said to be able to field up to a thousand chariots.

<text>Cystophora is a genus of brown algae found mostly in temperate waters around Australia.

== Description ==
Most of the southern Australian species can be immediately recognised as belonging to this genus by their characteristic zigzag branching pattern. Identification of individual species is generally more difficult and relies on the size and shape of branches, particularly terminal branches, which are specialised reproductive structures known as receptacles. Due to their local diversity and dominance in southern Australia, they are regarded by some as &#x27;the eucalypts of the underwater world&#x27;.

<text>Casuals F.C. were an amateur football club based in London, formed in 1883. They merged with Corinthian in 1939 to form the Corinthian-Casuals, a club which still exists.

==History==
The club was formed in 1883, and was originally made up of players exclusively of the old boys of Eton School, Westminster School and Charterhouse School but were quickly expanded to include players from all Universities and public schools. In the early days they would field up to five teams a week in order to meet all engagements.

For the duration of the 1890 FA Cup, the team merged with that of the Old Carthusians, who had won the trophy nine years previously.

They were founder members of the Isthmian League in 1905 though spent six seasons in the Southern Amateur League, 1907 to 1913, before returning to the Isthmian League for the 1913/14 season. Casuals won the FA Amateur Cup in 1936. In their early days playing the game they would tour the country like the Corinthians, and sometimes play more than one game in the same day, and at different venues, not at the same ground. They would also play more than once or twice a week, including playing everyday except Sunday.

In 1913, they defeated New Crusaders by 3 goals to 2 in the final of the AFA Senior Cup, after the Casuals scored a winning goal in the final minute.

In 1939, the club merged with Corinthian following a meeting on 4 January to form a new club Corinthian-Casuals at the end of the season. The merged club remains active and currently plays in the Combined Counties Premier Division South following back to back relegations from the Isthmian League Premier and South Central divisions in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

==Colours==

The club&#x27;s colours were pink and chocolate; the colours came from the pink of Westminster School and the maroon of Charterhouse School.

==Ground==

The club&#x27;s first ground was on Wandsworth Common, with the Surrey Hotel being used for facilities. The club moved to Wormwood Scrubs in 1890, and later played at the following grounds:

* 1905–14: Tufnell Park 
* 1919–20: Essex County Cricket Club
* 1920–21: East Molesey Cricket Club 
* 1921–22: St Joseph&#x27;s Road, Guildford

<doc id="1168256" wikidata="Q1391733" url="?curid=1168256" title="Farag Foda">
<text>Farag Foda ( ; 20 August 1945 – 8 June 1992) was a prominent Egyptian professor, writer, columnist, and human rights activist.

He was assassinated on 8 June 1992 by members of the Islamist group al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya after being accused of blasphemy by a committee of scholars (&quot;ulama&quot;) at al-Azhar University.

Farag Foda was one of 202 people killed by &quot;Islamist motivated assaults&quot; in Egypt between March 1992 and September 1993. In December 1992, his collected works were banned.

== Biography and background ==

Farag Foda was born in El Zarqa near Damietta in the Nile Delta. He worked as professor of agriculture. He wrote numerous books, and contributed as a columnist to the Egyptian magazine &quot;October&quot;. Foda wrote during a time of Islamic revival and growing influence of Islamism, both violent and non-violent. In Iran, Islamists had overthrown the Shah in 1979.

In 1983, Hezbollah suicide bombers destroyed the barracks of the American and French troops stationed in Beirut, killing hundreds. In Egypt, some who were claiming that they are Marxist intellectuals (such as Muhammad Imara or Tariq al-Bishri) converted to Islamism. Long beards became common and the hijab became an obligatory norm rather than the exception in universities and government offices. In the early 1980s, Islamic radicals assassinated president Anwar Sadat and attacked Coptic Orthodox churches, homes, and shops. In some villages in which the government lacks power or authority, Copts reported extortion by way of &quot;jizya&quot;; from 1992-1998, Islamists including Islamic Group that assassinated Foda fought an insurgency against the Egyptian government during which at least 796 Egyptian policemen, soldiers, and civilians including dozens of foreign tourists were killed.

=== Views and opinions ===
Among the few who defended secularism and ‘Western’ human rights, was Farag Foda. Foda was noted for his critical articles and satires of Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt. In many newspaper articles, he pointed out (what he believed to be) weak points in Islamist ideology and its demand for Sharia law, asking how it would deal with specific problems such as the housing shortage. He specifically criticized leading Islamist figures such as Anwar al-Jundi—who had praised the secularist, anti-Muslim Brotherhood regime of Gamal Abdel-Nasser in a 1965 book—and Muhammad al-Hayyawan—a Muslim Brotherhood leader who had attributed the 1988 Armenian earthquake to God&#x27;s punishment of the &#x27;atheist&#x27; Soviet Union, but offered no explanation for the equally deadly 1990 earthquake in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Though accused of apostasy, Foda argued he was defending Islam against its distortion by Islamists, stating &quot;Islam is a religion and Muslims are human beings; religion is blameless, while humans make mistakes&quot;. After an Islamist periodical condemned as immoral the broadcast of the ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot; on television, he argued that the problem lays within &quot;the onlooker or viewer (mushahid) rather than the looked upon view or what is viewed (mushahad)&quot; and quoted passages from a 1979 book, &quot;The Jurisprudence of Looking in Islam&quot;, which directs men to avoid looking at both women and males and, &quot;in particular, smooth-faced boys&quot;. In a column in &quot;October&quot; magazine shortly before his death, he lamented that &quot;the world around us is busy with the conquest of space, genetic engineering and the wonders of the computer,&quot; while Muslim scholars concern themselves with sex in paradise.

== Assassination ==

On 8 June 1992, Foda, after leaving his office, was shot dead by two assassins. His son and other bystanders were seriously wounded in the attack. The two gunmen had reportedly been &quot;monitoring Farag Foda’s movements and watching his house in al-Nuzha area in Heliopolis for several weeks&quot;. The jihadist group Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya announced responsibility.

Before his death, Farag Foda had been accused of blasphemy by Al-Azhar. 
The Al-Azhar ulama had thereby adopted a previous fatwā by Sheikh al-Azhar, Jadd al-Haqq, accusing Foda and other secularist writers of being &quot;enemies of Islam&quot;.

In a statement claimed responsibility for the killing, Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya accused Foda of being an apostate from Islam, advocating the separation of religion from the state, and favouring the existing legal system in Egypt rather than the application of Shari’a. The group explicitly referred to a religious fatwa of Al-Azhar when announcing responsibility. Eight of the thirteen Islamists brought to trial for the murder were subsequently acquitted.

One of those involved in Foda&#x27;s murder, Abu El&#x27;Ela Abdrabu (Abu Al-&#x27;Ela Abd Rabbo), was released from prison in 2012 having served his sentence. In an interview which aired on &quot;Al-Arabiya TV&quot; on June 14, 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), Abdrabu defended Foda&#x27;s murder, stating that &quot;The punishment for an apostate is death, even if he repents&quot; and that &quot;...[if] the ruler does not implement the shari&#x27;a, any of the citizens is entitled to carry out punishment of Allah.&quot; Abdrabu also stated that &quot;Farag Foda is dead, and will receive his in the Hereafter.&quot; When asked about the feelings of Foda&#x27;s children, Abdrabu accused the interviewer of using &quot;venomous methods&quot; against him, and then stated &quot;let me ask you if you were not harmed by someone who cursed the Prophet and his wives? What gives you greater pain and sorrow? If you say that Farag Foda is a believer, then you should reexamine your faith.&quot;

Foda&#x27;s eldest daughter Samar has rebutted the claims about her father&#x27;s alleged apostasy, stating: &quot;My father was a thinker in the full sense of the word and wholeheartedly defended moderate religion. I challenge his killers if they could spot a single text in his writings against religion.&quot;

<doc id="1168269" wikidata="Q14683467" url="?curid=1168269" title="Negit Island">
<text>Negit Island is an island in Mono Lake. Negit (along with nearby Paoha Island) is a volcanic cone less than 2000 years old. It can be considered to be the northernmost of the Mono Craters. Negit is composed of three dark dacite lava flows.

Negit is an important nesting ground for migratory birds, including the California gull, which can often be seen wheeling in the air above Mono Lake. The fall of the lake level since 1941 created a land bridge to the island. The land bridge permitted predators, such as coyotes, to raid the bird eggs on the island. However, since 1994, the lake level has been permitted to rise and the land bridge is currently submerged.

Negit Island is accessible by boats (commonly kayaks). However, the island is off-limits from April 1 through August 1, to protect the nesting gulls.

<doc id="1168272" wikidata="Q276306" url="?curid=1168272" title="Andrew Johnson (footballer, born 1981)">
<text>Andrew Johnson (born 10 February 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He played for Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers.

A legend at Crystal Palace, Johnson scored more than one goal per every other game in 140 appearances and helped Crystal Palace win promotion to the Premier League

He was capped eight times for England.

==Club career==
===Birmingham City===
Johnson was born in Bedford, Bedfordshire, and started his career at Luton Town&#x27;s Academy. He moved on to Birmingham City, where he signed his first professional contract on 11 March 1998. He missed a deciding penalty in the 2001 League Cup Final penalty shoot-out defeat to Liverpool.

After making over 100 appearances for the Blues, he was sold to Crystal Palace in 2002, following Birmingham&#x27;s promotion into the Premier League. Johnson was used as the makeweight in a transfer deal for Clinton Morrison, valued at £750,000 for the purposes of the transaction.

===Crystal Palace===
Johnson&#x27;s made a strong start to his career at Palace by scoring a hat-trick in the 5–0 thrashing of rivals Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 26 October 2002, and then another, in the next match, at Walsall. Despite this, he made few appearances until manager Trevor Francis was dismissed with the Eagles mid-table, and replaced by Steve Kember. Kember was replaced by Iain Dowie a few months into the 2003–04 season. Under the new manager, Johnson ended the season as top scorer in the 2003–04 First Division season with 32 goals. Palace reached the play-offs and were promoted into the Premier League for 2004–05 after beating West Ham United 1–0 in the final.

Despite Palace&#x27;s relegation back into the Championship the following season, Johnson was the highest scoring English player with 21 goals and the second highest overall in the Premier League. his form attracted the attention of England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson. Johnson requested a transfer, but signed a new five-year contract with Palace in August 2005.

Johnson was soon playing alongside Clinton Morrison, who had rejoined Palace from Birmingham for a fee of £2 million, three years after Birmingham had bought him in a deal for £4.25 million plus Johnson. However, due to injury to Johnson, and Morrison&#x27;s lack of form, the pairing was limited in the early part of the season. With a return to fitness and form, the two soon became Dowie&#x27;s first choice pairing as the season progressed, with Dougie Freedman adding experience to the strike force.

Palace comfortably made it into a top-six position but in the play-offs failed to recover from a first leg defeat at the hands of Watford, being beaten on aggregate in the semi-final. Johnson scored 15 goals in the Championship that season.

In 2005, Johnson was voted into Palace&#x27;s Centenary XI, the only player at the club at the time to be selected, and, together with Nigel Martyn, the only members of the XI then playing on a professional basis.

===Everton===
After Crystal Palace&#x27;s failure to return to top-flight football, speculation about Johnson&#x27;s future at the club began with a transfer to a Premier League club seeming highly likely. However, when an initial bid from Everton of £7.25 million was rejected, it looked more likely that the club would be able to keep Johnson for a further year after all. Nevertheless, the departure of manager Iain Dowie only increased the likelihood of Johnson&#x27;s departure, and on 24 May 2006 Palace accepted an £8.5m million offer from Wigan Athletic for Johnson. This bid was matched by fellow Lancashire club Bolton Wanderers a day later, which was also accepted.

With Johnson having indicated a preference for a move to Merseyside, Everton, prompted by the two other bids, improved their offer to £8.6 million the following day. On 30 May 2006, he passed his medical and completed the move to Goodison Park, signing a five-year contract. Johnson&#x27;s move set new club transfer records, both as Everton&#x27;s most expensive purchase and Palace&#x27;s most expensive sale.

Johnson scored his first goal for Everton on his debut on 19 August 2006, in a 2–1 win over Watford. He continued a good start to his Everton career by scoring against Tottenham Hotspur away to end a 21-year victory drought there and then scoring twice in the 3–0 derby victory against Liverpool. Johnson was Everton&#x27;s top scorer in the 2006–07 FA Premier League with 11 goals (and one in the FA Cup). However, Johnson was allegedly affected by allegations of simulation, going 13 matches without scoring a goal at one stage.

After a league match with Chelsea on 17 December 2006, Chelsea manager José Mourinho branded Johnson &quot;untrustworthy&quot; following a challenge with Chelsea goalkeeper Henrique Hilário. Everton issued a statement threatening legal action and calling on Mourinho to apologise, which he did two days later. Mourinho was not the first to air such sentiments about Johnson; former Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock also having accused Johnson of resorting to &quot;gamesmanship&quot; to win a penalty in a Premier League match between the two clubs.

Everton manager David Moyes took the unusual step of contacting the Professional Game Match Officials Board in order to counter these accusations. The board&#x27;s general manager Keith Hackett agreed that Johnson was being treated harshly and had been denied several clear penalties.

On 6 November 2007, Johnson signed a new five-year contract with Everton. During the new season, Johnson scored some vital goals for Everton, including a Premier League winner away to West Ham. He scored Everton&#x27;s first goal in the 2–1 away victory against Wigan Athletic, and was denied a winning goal at Blackburn Rovers, adjudged to have been offside.

Johnson scored twice in Everton&#x27;s 6–1 thrashing of SK Brann in the UEFA Cup. He scored Everton&#x27;s second and sixth goal and the last goal was a driven shot from outside the box. Johnson also scored in Everton&#x27;s Round of 16 tie against Fiorentina. He picked up a groin injury in Everton&#x27;s match at the Craven Cottage against Fulham.

===Fulham===
In July 2008, Everton accepted an offer of &quot;an eight figure sum&quot; from Fulham for Johnson. It was reported that problems had arisen from his medical, prompting a possible renegotiation of the fee, but the move was completed on 7 August 2008, the player signing a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £10.5 million. He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers at Craven Cottage on 13 September 2008. Johnson was sent off against West Ham United on 27 September 2008 for two bookable offences. He scored his first and second Fulham goals against Wigan Athletic on 29 October 2008.

Johnson finished the 2008–09 season with 10 goals helping Fulham to finish in seventh place and qualify for the UEFA Europa League. He made only 13 appearances for Fulham in 2009–10, scoring three goals, as he missed much of the season due to a troublesome knee problem. He also missed most of the early part of the 2010–11 season with injury. He made a good start to the 2011–12 season, scoring a Premier League hat-trick on 2 October in the 6–0 win over West London rivals Queens Park Rangers. Johnson also scored twice in Fulham&#x27;s 4–1 win over Wisła Kraków on 4 November 2011, putting them on the brink of securing a place in the knockout stages of the UEFA Europa League. These goals were Johnson&#x27;s seventh and eighth in the UEFA Europa League; he also scored against NSÍ Runavík, Crusaders, RNK Split, Twente and Odense.

Johnson&#x27;s contract at Fulham expired in June 2012 and he was released after four years at the club.

===Queens Park Rangers===
In June 2012, Johnson signed for Queens Park Rangers on a two-year contract. Johnson made his debut as a substitute in the first match of the season at home against Swansea City. Johnson made his first start away at Manchester City, providing an assist for Bobby Zamora&#x27;s equalising goal. On 17 September 2012, it was announced that Johnson was likely to miss the majority of the season with a cruciate ligament injury. In August 2013, Johnson scored the winning goal in Queens Park Rangers&#x27; opening fixture of the Championship season against Sheffield Wednesday. He was released on 1 July 2014 following the end of his contract.

===Return to Crystal Palace===
On 3 September 2014, Johnson signed a short-term contract with Crystal Palace on a free transfer, and was given some coaching responsibility with academy players. He left the club at the start of January 2015 when that contract expired, having made a solitary appearance in the League Cup.

On 30 March 2016, Johnson returned to Crystal Palace as an ambassador. His duties would again involve some coaching responsibility as well as involvement with the community.

==International career==
Johnson was first capped for England at U20 level, being selected in the team for the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside Stuart Taylor, Ashley Cole, Peter Crouch and Matthew Etherington. The team finished bottom of their group, losing all three matches without scoring.

As the top English goalscorer in the 2004–05 Premier League, there were many calling for him to be selected for the full England squad. Midway through the season, Johnson revealed that he would accept a call-up to the national team of Poland, after being eligible through his grandfather being born in Poland. This subsequently hurried then England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson into giving Johnson his first call-up, to face the Netherlands on 9 February 2005, and he made his first international appearance in that match.

A second cap came when Johnson made his full debut for England, in a 2–1 friendly win over the United States, during England&#x27;s tour of America in the summer of 2005. On 9 May 2006, Johnson was put on standby by Eriksson in his squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He was also an unused substitute in the England B match against Belarus and the first team&#x27;s wins over Hungary and Jamaica.

When Steve McClaren was installed as England coach, Johnson got further opportunities to play for his country in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers. Johnson made substitute appearances against Andorra (at Old Trafford on 2 September 2006) and away to Macedonia (on 6 September 2006). Johnson then made his first competitive start for England in the Euro 2008 qualifier with Israel.

==Post-retirement life==
Johnson now runs a property company, and also works for Fortus, a business advisory firm. In February 2024, Johnson was appointed to the role of director of football at AFC Croydon Athletic, a non-league club.

<text>Hagbard ( ), the brother of Haki and son of Hamund, was a famous Scandinavian sea-king in Norse mythology. He is mentioned in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot;, &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. The heroes&#x27; connections with other legendary characters place the events in the 5th century AD.

Hagbard remained well-known until recent times in the legend of Hagbard and Signy. This famous legend tells that Hagbard fell in love with Signy, the daughter of king Sigar, the nephew of king Siggeir (of the Völsunga saga), a love affair which ended in their deaths, when Sigar wanted to have Hagbard hanged. This legend is told most fully in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 7).

However, most legends surrounding Hagbard are probably lost. In the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Gudrun and Brynhild have a discussion on the &quot;greatest of men&quot; referring to a legend now lost, where Hagbard is mentioned together with Haki&#x27;s sons, who have not yet avenged their sisters by killing the evil Sigar (the feud with Sigar is still going on and Hagbard not yet hanged):
Snorri Sturluson wrote in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; that Hagbard occasionally plundered together with his brother Haki. Concerning, the adventures and death of the Swedish king Jorund (whom Snorri makes a successor of Haki), he cites the poem &quot;Háleygjatal&quot; by a Norwegian skald named Eyvindr skáldaspillir containing the Kenning &quot;Sigar&#x27;s steed&quot; referring to the legend of Hagbard and Signy:

The same kenning appears with Hagbard&#x27;s name in a stanza from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, which Snorri also quotes in the same section:

<doc id="1168280" wikidata="Q2490585" url="?curid=1168280" title="Max Geldray">
<text>Max van Gelder (12 February 1916 – 2 October 2004), professionally known as Max Geldray, was a Dutch jazz harmonica player. Best known for providing musical interludes for the BBC radio comedy programme &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, he was also credited as being the first harmonica player to embrace the jazz style.

Geldray was born in the Netherlands and played jazz in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and his home country, before settling in Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War; he was wounded during the Invasion of Normandy. He appeared in nearly every episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; from 1951 until the end of the show&#x27;s run in 1960, providing one of the musical interludes and the closing music for each programme, as well as sometimes taking brief speaking roles. After &quot;The Goon Show&quot; series ended, Geldray settled in the US, where he worked as an entertainer in the Reno casinos alongside performers such as Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Moving to Palm Springs, he eventually became a part-time counsellor at the Betty Ford Center. He was married twice and had one son. Geldray died in October 2004, aged 88.

==Early life (1916–46)==

Geldray was born Max Leon van Gelder, on 12 February 1916 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Jewish parents. His father, Leon van Gelder, was a commercial traveller, and his mother was Margarite, née Baillosterky. By 1922, Leon was the European Manager for Maja perfume and the family moved out of Amsterdam to Bilthoven. Both parents could play the piano—Leon was self-taught and played by ear, while Margarite was classically trained—and it was Leon who started to teach Geldray how to play. He developed love of jazz music after hearing Louis Armstrong on the radio in 1928; Geldray later wrote &quot;how could anyone &quot;not&quot; love its energy, its vitality and the freedom of its form? And Louis Armstrong among all the players, became something special to me&quot;.

In February 1930, Geldray heard a mouth organ played on BBC Radio and mentioned the performance to a friend, Hans Mossel, owner of a music shop in Amsterdam; Mossel had ordered a chromatic harmonica the previous week and gave it to Geldray, who practised assiduously. By 1934, Geldray had made some appearances on Dutch radio and formed a band with eight others; an agent named Franklin billed the group as &quot;Mac Geldray and his Mouth Accordion Band&quot;, changing the surname of the principal to the name he retained for the rest of his life. With his performances, Geldray became the first person to play the harmonica in the jazz style. A change in the format of the band to a quartet and the introduction of a new manager led to a six-week tour of English theatres in 1937, accompanying the comedian Tom Moss; the band changed its name to &quot;The Hollander Boys&quot;. During the tour, Moss introduced Geldray to Jack Hylton, who invited him to play in his orchestra for the evening.

On his return to the Netherlands, the harmonica band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band . He would meet performers who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the &quot;Hot Club de France&quot; and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserted, &quot;I can honestly say that I have never heard anyone better&quot;. The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940, he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 he was part of the entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942, Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943.

Geldray took part in the Normandy landings with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not incur long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He found that both parents and his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work with Ray Ventura&#x27;s orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947.

==BBC years (1947–61)==

Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, and worked on a number of BBC radio programmes, such as &quot;Workers&#x27; Playtime&quot;, &quot;Melody Magazine&quot; and &quot;Forces&#x27; All-Star Bill&quot;. In 1951, he provided the musical interludes for a new BBC series &quot;Crazy People&quot;, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Michael Bentine. &quot;Crazy People&quot; changed its name for subsequent series to &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC used the same structure for several radio series. In &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot; for the play-out music. On occasion, Geldray was given brief lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a running gag on the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goon jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as &quot;Conks&quot;, on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: &quot;That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought you ought to know what it was, anyhow.&quot;

In the early 1950s, Geldray&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce, after the relationship had &quot;burned itself out&quot;, and he began a relationship with a dancer, Barbara. In 1956, Geldray appeared in three television comedy shows produced by ITV and starring the Goons: &quot;The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d&quot; (broadcast 24 February – 23 April 1956), &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot; (broadcast 2–30 May 1956) and &quot;Son of Fred&quot; (broadcast 17 September – 5 November 1956). In 1957, he released an album, &quot;Goon with the Wind&quot;, which was produced by George Martin and released on the Parlophone label. Later that year, Geldray also appeared in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s 43 Minutes&quot;, the Christmas edition of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, broadcast on 23 December 1957. In 1958, the BBC proposed dropping Geldray from &quot;The Goon Show&quot; in a cost-cutting measure; Peter Sellers threatened to leave the series, and Geldray remained.

&quot;The Goon Show&quot; finished its ten-series run on 28 January 1960. In 1961, with his six-year relationship with Barbara at an end, Geldray worked as an entertainer on four trips on the RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. On visiting Los Angeles he was impressed by the city and decided to emigrate to the US.

==Moving to the US (1961–2004)==

Geldray worked in the casinos of Reno, appearing with Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels; he did not like the city, so returned to Los Angeles. In 1962, he met a divorcee with three children, Susan Donofrio; the couple married that year, and in 1964 they had a son, Philip. Geldray worked for a period as a sales assistant in a clothes shop before becoming the regional sales supervisor for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;.

In 1972, Geldray returned to the UK to appear in &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot;, a special programme recorded on 30 April and broadcast on 5 October 1972 to mark the 50th anniversary of the BBC. When the BBC refused to pay to fly Geldray from the US, two of the show&#x27;s cast—Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers—contributed to his expenses.
After the performance, at the Camden Theatre, Princess Margaret came backstage and asked if she could be introduced to Geldray as she was an admirer of his playing.

In 1973, Geldray and his family moved to Palm Springs to look after his ailing stepfather; he also played harmonica in the local Trinidad Bar. A local doctor approached him after one set and asked if Geldray would put on a show at his stroke centre, which led to Geldray undertaking voluntary work teaching stroke victims to play the harmonica. Following the death of Geldray&#x27;s youngest step-son, Timmy, Susan Geldray began drinking to excess, and she underwent treatment at the Betty Ford Center. Geldray volunteered to help at the clinic and qualified as a counsellor and technician. To raise funds for the clinic he started &quot;Jazz without Booze&quot;, a series of concerts, which included prominent local musicians, including Stan Getz. In 1989, Geldray published his autobiography, &quot;Goon With the Wind&quot;, using the same title as he had for his 1957 album.

Geldray died in Palm Springs of natural causes on 2 October 2004 at the age of 88.

<text>Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD, 27 January) is a national commemoration day in the United Kingdom dedicated to the remembrance of the Jews and others who suffered in the Holocaust, under Nazi persecution. It was first held in January 2001 and has been on the same date every year since. The chosen date is the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp by the Soviet Union in 1945, the date also chosen for the International Holocaust Remembrance Day and some other national Holocaust Memorial Days.

In addition to the national event, there are numerous smaller memorial events around the country organised by many different organisations, groups and individuals.

Since 2005, Holocaust Memorial Day has been supported by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity set up and funded by the UK Government.

The theme for Holocaust Memorial Day 2024 was &quot;Fragility of Freedom&quot;.

==Holocaust Memorial Day 2017==
As preparations began to mark Holocaust Memorial Day 2017, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, broadcast on 15 January 2017, was a special Holocaust Memorial programme that included many precious objects from Holocaust victims and survivors.

==Holocaust Memorial Day 2016==
The UK Commemorative Ceremony for HMD was broadcast by the BBC. Participants included Robert Lindsay, Emilia Fox, Freddie Fox, Naomie Harris, David Olusoga, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Kevin Whately. Music throughout the ceremony was provided by a diverse range of acts including Darfuri singer Shurooq Abu el Nas, the Choir of Clare College Cambridge, the London Klezmer Quartet and violinist Jennifer Pike. Survivors and their experiences were central to the ceremony and survivors made up a significant part of the audience.

A special reception for survivors and refugees took place a week before the ceremony at the Speaker&#x27;s House at the Houses of Parliament.

===UK Commemorative Ceremony===
The UK Commemorative Ceremony for HMD was broadcast by the BBC, attracting 1.3 million viewers. Participants included Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the UK Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition; the Chief Rabbi and the Archbishop of Canterbury; and actors Adrian Lester, John Hurt, Michael Palin, Keeley Hawes, Sarah Lancashire, Christopher Eccleston, and Laurence Fox. Survivors and their experiences were central to the ceremony and survivors made up a significant part of the audience.

The ceremony was preceded by a special reception for survivors and refugees. Guests at the reception included the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the three main Westminster party leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury, celebrity contributors to the ceremony and members of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Holocaust Commission.

=== Memory Makers project ===
Eight artists took part in the Memory Makers art project by producing pieces of art in response to meeting Holocaust and genocide survivors. Artists and survivors who took part in the project included:

* Stephen Fry met with survivor of Auschwitz Anita Lasker-Wallfisch
* Filmmaker and animator Gemma Green-Hope met Auschwitz survivor Ivor Perl
* Collage artist and animator Martin O&#x27;Neill met Holocaust survivor Bettine Le Beau
* Severely visually impaired illustrator Kimberley Burrows met Holocaust survivor Sabina Miller
* Filmmaker Debs Paterson met Holocaust survivor Janine Webber
* Poet Sarah Hesketh met Holocaust survivor Eve Kugler
* Ceramicist Clare Twomey met with Nisad &#x27;Šiško&#x27; Jakupović, who survived the notorious Omarska concentration camp during the Bosnian War. Twomey&#x27;s Humanity is in our Hands project asked members of the public what human qualities they believe allow society to flourish. The resulting artwork will be showcased as part of Holocaust Memorial Day 2016.

=== Moving Portraits ===
A series of Moving Portraits of Holocaust and genocide survivors screened on big screens in cities across the UK, projected onto London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, and used in dozens of local HMD commemorations.

=== 70 candles for 70 years with Sir Anish Kapoor ===
Sir Anish Kapoor designed 70 special commemorative candles, which were lit at 70 HMD activities around the UK, demonstrating the breadth and diversity of the commemorations in every part of the country. Six candles were lit at the UK Commemorative Ceremony to represent the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and a candle was taken to Auschwitz Birkenau by Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.

==Holocaust Memorial Day event in Parliament 2010==
In 2010, Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn co-chaired an event at the Houses of Parliament in which Holocaust analogies were used to criticise the Israeli government&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians, with the main talk by anti-Zionist Auschwitz survivor, 9/11 conspiracy theorist, and Pearl Harbor conspiracy theorist, Hajo Meyer.

The event was criticised by Jon Benjamin, Board of Deputies chief executive, who said: &quot;This latest attempt to exploit the most painful chapter in Jewish history in order to berate and demonise Israel is among the most despicable.&quot; One audience member, the Holocaust survivor Rubin Katz, said that &quot;the room was brimming with raging hatred, directed at Israel and Jews.&quot;

Other commentators saw things differently. One complained, in the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, about the presence of &quot;Zionist hecklers who shamed Holocaust Memorial events&quot;. One eye-witness complained about &quot;the hounding of 85-year old Dr. Meyer, and the bellows of ‘boring!’ every time any survivor of a different genocide tried to tell about their experience.&quot; Eye-witnesses claim that another pro-Israel protester shouted &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; and gave a Nazi salute. Jonathan Hoffman, a vice-chair of the Zionist Federation, confirming his involvement in this protest, wrote that &quot;the meeting descended into chaos &quot;no fewer than nine times&quot;, as we protested.&quot; Hoffman later justified the protests at Hajo Meyer&#x27;s talk, claiming that Meyer was &quot;a raging anti-Semite. The fact that he was in Auschwitz for ten months is entirely irrelevant.&quot;

In 2018, when he was asked about his involvement with the meeting, Corbyn said that &quot;Views were expressed at the meeting which I do not accept or condone. In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject.&quot;

==History==
Since 1996, 27 January has officially been &quot;Gedenktag für die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus&quot; (Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism) in Germany. Italy and Poland have adopted similar memorial days.

On 10 June 1999, Andrew Dismore MP asked Prime Minister Tony Blair about the creation of memorial day for the Holocaust. In reply, Tony Blair also referred to the ethnic cleansing that was being witnessed in the Kosovo War at that time and said:

I am determined to ensure that the horrendous crimes against humanity committed during the Holocaust are never forgotten. The ethnic cleansing and killing that has taken place in Europe in recent weeks are a stark example of the need for vigilance.

A consultation took place during October of that year. On 27 January 2000, representatives from forty-four governments around the world met in Stockholm to discuss Holocaust education, remembrance and research. At the conclusion of the forum, the delegates unanimously signed a declaration. This declaration forms the basis of the &quot;Statement of Commitment&quot; (see below) adopted for Holocaust Memorial Day.

In 2005 the United Nations voted, by 149 votes out of 191, to formally commemorate the Holocaust.

The current patron of the charity is Charles III, who succeeded his mother Elizabeth II as patron in July 2015.

==Statement of Commitment for Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK==
The statement of commitment for HMD in the UK was created after the Stockholm Declaration was agreed. It is a simplified version of the Stockholm Declaration, and includes a commitment to remember all victims of Nazi Persecution, and victims of all genocides. Many HMD activity organisers use this by arranging for participants to read from as part of their activity.
# We recognise that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation. Its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal meaning.
# We believe the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation&#x27;s collective memory. We honour the survivors still with us, and reaffirm our shared goals of mutual understanding and justice.
# We must make sure that future generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon its consequences. We vow to remember the victims of Nazi persecution and of all genocide.
# We value the sacrifices of those who have risked their lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity for good in the face of evil.
# We recognise that humanity is still scarred by the belief that race, religion, disability or sexuality make some people&#x27;s lives worth less than others&#x27;. Genocide, antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue. We have a shared responsibility to fight these evils.
# We pledge to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research about the Holocaust and other genocide. We will do our utmost to make sure that the lessons of such events are fully learnt.
# We will continue to encourage Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual Holocaust Memorial Day. We condemn the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism. We value a free, tolerant, and democratic society.

==Criticism==

===Muslim Council of Britain===
Between 2001 and 2007, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) expressed its unwillingness to attend the ceremony. The MCB instead called for a more inclusive day proposing the commemoration of deaths in Palestine, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, along with the Holocaust. In 2005 the then General Secretary of the MCB, Iqbal Sacranie, suggested that the deaths of Palestinians should also be remembered.

On 3 December 2007, the MCB voted to end the boycott. Assistant General Secretary Inayat Bunglawala argued it was &#x27;inadvertently causing hurt to some in the Jewish community&#x27;. However, the MCB renewed their boycott for the 2009 commemoration, in reaction to the 2008–2009 conflict in Gaza. Despite initially refusing to confirm whether or not they would take part in the 2010 commemoration, they eventually voted to send a junior representative, Shuja Shafi, to attend the event in London.

===Armenians===
The event also drew similar criticism in 2000 from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Armenian community, who complained that the event remained exclusively for commemorating those who perished in the Holocaust, and not the Armenian genocide. Neil Frater, an official from Tony Blair&#x27;s Race Equality Unit, a branch of the Home Office, replied that it had consulted the Holocaust Memorial Day Steering Group on the issue and had agreed that while it understood that the Armenian Genocide was an &quot;appalling tragedy&quot;, it wanted to &quot;avoid the risk of the message becoming too diluted if we try to include too much history.&quot; Frater went on to say that it had gone on with the Steering Group&#x27;s advice to reject commemorating the Genocide. His comments were received with even more criticism. Zaven Messerlian, the principal of the Armenian Evangelical College in Beirut, Lebanon, stated that &quot;any serious commemoration must include the aetiology of genocide, particularly those of the twentieth century, especially if one encouraged the next.&quot; The UK-based Refugee Council also supported this position, since the event was supposed to include &quot;all victims of genocide.&quot;

The British government faced a flurry of public criticism for its decision not to include the Armenian Genocide, most notably in the daily newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, from its chief Middle East correspondent, British author Robert Fisk. After months of pressure, the government allowed 20 Armenian survivors to attend the event in its first annual commemoration. Armenians contended that the British government held out for so long because it wished to preserve its relationship with the successor state of the Ottoman Empire and NATO ally, Turkey.

===Holocaust Memorial Day Trust===
To mark Holocaust Remembrance Day 2019, the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust released a survey result, commissioned by the Trust and derived from a tick-box online poll of 2006 people undertaken by the market research company Opinion Matters, that claimed &quot;five per cent of UK adults don&#x27;t believe the Holocaust&quot;, a figure widely reported in &quot;lurid terms&quot; in UK media such as &quot;More than 2.6m Brits are Holocaust deniers, poll finds&quot;. &quot;More or Less&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 programme on the use and misuse of statistics, noted that the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust had provided only basic information on its website Press Release, and said that Opinion Matters had refused to release &quot;the full data on individual responses&quot;. In the programme, survey methodology experts described the results as &quot;unlikely&quot;, saying there were &quot;some serious flaws with this study&quot;, that the design of the survey displayed &quot;poor practice&quot;, and that the questions were badly written and with poor consistency risking respondents agreeing things they actually disagree with. Inconsistencies in responses suggested lack of clarity in the questions: &quot;when asked how many Jewish people were murdered during the Holocaust: only 5 people in the entire survey gave an answer of zero ... so that&#x27;s one quarter of 1% ... a figure inconsistent with the 5% (figure) of people (who) deny the Holocaust occurrence&quot;. They compared the poll to a US study from the 1990s that, due to &quot;confusing multiple negatives&quot; in its questions, estimated the number of Holocaust deniers in the US at more than 20% when the correct number was more like 2% of the population. Matthew Parris wrote that the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust had &quot;defamed Britain&quot;, suggesting the Trust has designed its survey from a desire to produce bad news for effect.

<text>The Bideford Railway Heritage Centre CIC (previously the Bideford and Instow Railway Group) in Devon, England is a community interest company that is responsible for the management of the site of Bideford railway station.
The company is also responsible for Instow signal box which opens on occasional Sundays and bank holidays from Easter to October.

==History==

The line was opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848. Passenger trains ran throughout from Barnstaple railway station to Bideford from 2 November 1855 as the Bideford Extension Railway. The line was further extended to Torrington in 1872 when the current Bideford railway station was opened.

Passenger services ceased on 2 October 1965 although ball clay traffic continued until 1982. The track was removed in 1985 after some interest by British Rail in reintroducing a passenger service to Bideford. The trackbed was later converted into the Tarka Trail, a walkway using the formation between Petrockstow (later the terminus of services after the line was truncated in the 1960s) and Barnstaple Junction.

In 2009, James May attempted to reconnect the former Bideford station with Barnstaple Junction using an OO scale model train as part of &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;. Unfortunately, the last train - a Hornby Class 395 &quot;Javelin&quot;, and the prototype model for the production models - burnt out at Instow at 12:18am the day after the trains left Barnstaple.
In 2011, May returned to complete the challenge with the help of the German model railway attraction Miniatur Wonderland, racing several model trains over the from Barnstaple to Bideford. The first train to arrive at Bideford was a Hornby Intercity 125, followed by a hydrogen-powered train and finally, May&#x27;s own model of LNER &#x27;Pacific&#x27; 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;.

==Visitor attractions==
The Bideford Railway Heritage Centre has developed the site since 1989 to ensure a preservation presence at the old Bideford station. A replica of the original signal box was built in 1992 and signal levers were installed later. An interactive interpretation centre was opened in the green PMV (Parcels and Miscellaneous Van) in 2019. Short passenger rides are given at Bideford on dates announced on the website www.bidefordrailway.co.uk, using the Planet diesel locomotive. The site has been fully renovated and is open from Easter to the end of October at weekends and school holidays. A cafe in the Mark 1 coach at these times for walkers and cyclists on the Tarka Trail. The site is accessible from the Tarka Trail even when the station site is not open.

<doc id="1168290" wikidata="Q2005304" url="?curid=1168290" title="Endless Wire (The Who album)">
<text>Endless Wire is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 30 October 2006 in the UK through Polydor Records and the following day in the US by Universal Republic. It was their first new studio album of original material in 24 years following the release of &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; in 1982, as well as their first since the death of their founding bassist John Entwistle. It was originally due to be released in early 2005 under the working title &quot;WHO2&quot;.

&quot;Endless Wire&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. It debuted at #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and #9 in the UK. Portions of it were featured on The Who Tour 2006-2007. Most of the songs from this album were used in the rock musical adaptation of &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot; which debuted in July 2007 as part of Vassar College&#x27;s Powerhouse Summer Theater workshop series.

==History and composition==
Most of what is known about the development of the album has come from Pete Townshend&#x27;s website. On 21 March 2005, Pete Townshend announced the postponement of the new Who album. On 24 December 2005, Townshend announced that manager Bill Curbishley had introduced a &quot;great scheme&quot; to allow the band to tour in mid-2006 in support of new material, even if Townshend did not have &quot;a full thirty tracks ready to go.&quot; On 20 March 2006, Daltrey announced that he and Townshend were making progress with the album and that Townshend had written a song about Stockholm syndrome, titled &quot;Black Widow&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. Daltrey also said that Townshend was playing some bass on the album.

On 28 March 2006, Townshend announced through the diary portion of his website that a mini-opera, titled &quot;The Glass Household&quot;, now formed the core of the album. It is based on his novella &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot;. He also announced plans to have a shortened version of the opera released prior to the release of the full album. This diary entry also confirmed the line-up of the band: Pino Palladino on bass, Pete Townshend on guitars, his brother Simon Townshend on backing vocals, and John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick on keyboards. Peter Huntington, from Rachel Fuller&#x27;s band, was on drums because Zak Starkey was touring with Oasis.

On 9 April 2006, Townshend announced that the shortened version of &quot;The Glass Household&quot; had been played to executives at Polydor, and a release date had been set for June, with a tour of Europe following, and the album in September. On 3 May 2006, Pete Townshend posted on his diary page that the mastering for the new EP, titled &quot;Wire &amp; Glass&quot;, was complete and that the tracks would soon be sent to Polydor. Townshend anticipated a mid-June release for the EP, and a mid-September release for the full album. He had also announced that the Who would begin rehearsing for their tour, during which time Townshend would finish recording the rest of the album with Roger Daltrey.

A version of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; was released online at artistdirect.com. &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; had tentatively been announced as the first single off the album, to be released simultaneously.

On 3 October 2006, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; was made available on iTunes. &quot;Tea &amp; Theatre&quot; was also made available. Then on 14 October 2006, Polydor built a website for the album, endlesswire.co.uk, on which samples of the songs &quot;We Got a Hit&quot;, &quot;Endless Wire&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, &quot;Mike Post Theme&quot;, and &quot;Man in a Purple Dress&quot; were made available to listen to, but not to download. As of 23 October 2006, the entire album was available to stream on music.aol.com.

&quot;Mike Post Theme&quot; alludes to the ubiquity of Mike Post&#x27;s work in television theme music.

&quot;Endless Wire&quot; debuted at #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 81,000 units in its first week of release.

==Additional songs==
In addition to the 19 tracks listed below, three songs were either considered for inclusion on the album or reportedly recorded for the album but were left off:

*&quot;Ambition&quot;
Reportedly written in 1971 for the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; concept, Townshend debuted this song on &quot;In the Attic&quot; in 2006.

*&quot;Uncertain Girl&quot;
Another song that was debuted by Townshend on &quot;In the Attic&quot; in 2006. It was recorded in the studio with Zak Starkey on drums, and Daltrey on vocals, but Townshend expressed doubt on whether it would make it on the album or not when he first played it on in the Attic, and it was not included. However, it did make an appearance in the Vassar College workshop performance of the rock musical &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot;.

*&quot;How Can I Help You, Sir?&quot;
On 18 December 2005, Pete Townshend posted a diary entry that chronicled the recording of this track:
The video can be downloaded from Townshend&#x27;s site. In 2015 the track was released on Townshend&#x27;s solo compilation .

==Adaptation as a rock musical==
Townshend is also working the songs from this album into a full-length rock musical, a rough version of which debuted 13 July 2007 as part of Vassar College&#x27;s Powerhouse Summer Theater workshop series. The production was adapted and directed by Ethan Silverman and presented as a staged concert reading with minimal dialogue. The cast included John Hickok as Ray High, Jon Patrick Walker as Josh, Matt McGrath as Gabriel, and Bree Sharp as Leila. Songs in this adaptation included:

<doc id="1168294" wikidata="Q4890021" url="?curid=1168294" title="Royal Varuna Yacht Club">
<text>The Royal Varuna Yacht Club (RVYC) () is a yacht club near Pattaya, a popular tourist destination in Thailand. This club is named after Varuna (IAST: ), the Vedic divinity that rules the oceans.

==History==
The history of RVYC is the history of yacht-racing, sailing, and cruising in Thailand. One of RVYC&#x27;s co-founders, Prince Bhisatej Rajani, could be regarded as the godfather of sailing in Thailand. His contributions go well beyond the founding of RVYC, for it was he who introduced the king to dinghy sailing.

Prince Bhisatej was one of ten persons who answered Walter Meyer&#x27;s advertisement in the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; in April, 1957, seeking boating friends to form a boating club. An Australian, an Italian, two Swiss, and a Thai met at the Cosmopolitan Restaurant in Bangkok. By the end of that lunch, Prince Bhisatej, Sid Watkins, Robert (Rachiman) Gintzburger, Roberto Maestrini, and Walter Meyer launched the Varuna Marine Club, with the aim of promoting all water sports, including power-boating, water-skiing, scuba diving, sailing, cruising, and yacht-racing. The Varuna Marine Club was officially opened on the weekend of 15–16 February 1958.

The RVYC was established in 1957 as the Varuna Marine Club. Prince Bhisadej was in charge of the sailing programme and Swiss resident Walter Meyer was the first flag commodore. The club was bestowed royal patronage (ในพระบรมราชูปถัมภ์) by the King of Thailand on April 26, 1965, becoming the &quot;Royal Varuna Yacht Club&quot;. 

The Royal Varuna is a well-equipped sailing club outside Pattaya town on a secluded public beach limited by rocky cliffs on one side. The club&#x27;s facilities include boat storage, boat repair, parking, a beach bar and a swimming pool. It also rents accommodation with rooms of varying standard.

The club&#x27;s new premises formally opened in 2003. Its main feature is a wide reception area, the &quot;Club House&quot;, where most socializing and official business takes place. There is a restaurant, cafeteria, and bar in the facility. Next to the Club House is a &quot;Kid&#x27;s Club&quot; for children. The second floor of the Club House has offices and a television room.

==Royal patronage==
In March 1965, the Varuna Marine Club membership was invited to the king&#x27;s own newly established Royal Chitralada Yacht Squadron at the Klai Kangwon Palace in Hua Hin. After the races, Prince Bhisatej announced that the king had extended royal patronage to the Varuna Marine Club. A month later, on 26 April 1965, the Varuna Marine Club become the Royal Varuna Yacht Club. On 14 September 1968, the king, accompanied by the queen, the crown prince, and princesses, officially inaugurated the Royal Varuna Yacht Club.

== Activities ==
Royal Varuna is an internationally recognized yacht club that regularly organizes sailing events. Regattas occur most weekends and there are annual competitions that include competitors from other parts of Asia. It is a member of the Yacht Racing Association of Thailand (YRAT).

<text>Merneptah () or Merenptah (reigned July or August 1213–2 May 1203 BCE) was the fourth pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. According to contemporary historical records, he ruled Egypt for almost ten years, from late July or early August 1213 until his death on 2 May 1203. He was the first royal-born pharaoh since Tutankhamun of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.

Merneptah was the thirteenth son of Ramesses II, only coming to power because all of his older brothers had died, including his full brother Khaemweset.

He was around seventy years old when he ascended to the throne. He is arguably best known for the Merneptah Stele, featuring the first known mention of the name Israel. His throne name was &quot;Ba-en-re Mery-netjeru&quot;, which means &quot;Soul of Ra, Beloved of the Gods&quot;.

==Early years==
===Family===

Merneptah was likely the fourth child born to Isetnofret and Ramesses II, and his thirteenth son. He was the first royal-born pharaoh since Tutankhamun. He married Isetnofret II, who was likely his full sister or niece, who would become Great Royal Wife when he was named pharaoh. They had at least two sons, Merenptah, named after his father, and Seti II. When Seti II became pharaoh, Tausret became his Great Royal Wife. She became pharaoh in her own right after the death of pharaoh Siptah.

Takhat, the mother of Amenmesse, may have been a secondary queen, though scholars are yet to confirm this.

===King&#x27;s Son===
Ramesses II lived well into his nineties and was one of the oldest pharaohs in Egyptian history. He outlived many of his heirs; eventually, Merneptah would be the son to succeed him. Merneptah would have been prepared to be pharaoh through the responsibility of his government roles. However, we know virtually nothing about Merneptah before Year 40 of Ramesses II, when he became Overseer of the Army (General).

===Crown Prince===
In Year 55 of Ramesses II, he was officially proclaimed crown prince. At that point, he gained additional responsibilities by serving as Prince Regent for the last twelve years of Ramesses II&#x27;s life.

==Reign==
===Chronology===
According to one reading of contemporary historical records, Merneptah ruled Egypt for almost ten years, from late July or early August 1213 BC until his death on 2 May 1203 BC.

===New capital===
Merneptah moved Egypt&#x27;s administrative center from Pi-Ramesses, his father&#x27;s capital, back to Memphis, where he constructed a royal palace next to the temple of Ptah. The Penn Museum, led by Clarence Stanley Fisher, excavated this palace in 1915.

===Campaigns===

Merneptah had to carry out several military campaigns during his reign. In the fifth year of his rule, he fought against the Libyans, who—with the assistance of the Sea Peoples—were threatening Egypt from the west. Merneptah led a victorious six-hour battle against a combined Libyan and Sea People force at the city of Perire, probably located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. His account of this campaign against the Sea Peoples and Libu is described in prose on a wall beside the sixth pylon at Karnak, which states:

: [Beginning of the victory that his majesty achieved in the land of Libya] -I, Ekwesh, Teresh, Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Northerners coming from all lands.

Later in the inscription, Merneptah receives news of the attack:

: ... the third season, saying: &#x27;The wretched, fallen chief of Libya, Meryre, son of Ded, has fallen upon the country of Tehenu with his bowmen—Sherden, Shekelesh, Ekwesh, Lukka, Teresh, Taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children—leaders of the camp, and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perire.&#x27;
An inscription on the Athribis Stele, now in the garden of Cairo Museum, declares &quot;His majesty was enraged at their report, like a lion&quot;, assembled his court, and gave a rousing speech. Later he dreamed that he saw Ptah handing him a sword and saying &quot;Take thou (it) and banish thou the fearful heart from thee.&quot; When the bowmen went forth, says the inscription, &quot;Amun was with them as a shield.&quot; After six hours the surviving Nine Bows threw down their weapons, abandoned their baggage and dependents, and ran for their lives. Merneptah states that he defeated the invasion, killing 6,000 soldiers and taking 9,000 prisoners. To be sure of the numbers, among other things, he took the penises of all uncircumcised enemy dead and the hands of all the circumcised, from which history learns that the Ekwesh were circumcised, a fact causing some to doubt that they were Greek people.

There is also an account of the same events in the form of a poem from the Merneptah Stele, also known as the &quot;Israel Stele&quot;, which mentions the suppression of revolts in Canaan and makes reference to the supposed utter destruction of Israel in a campaign prior to his fifth year, in Canaan: &quot;Israel has been wiped out ... its seed is no more.&quot; This is the first recognised ancient Egyptian record of the existence of Israel—&quot;not as a country or city, but as a tribe&quot; or people. A newly discovered massive layer of fiery destruction confirms Merneptah&#x27;s boast about his Canaanite campaign.

===Inscriptions===
*At Karnak, the Great Karnak Inscription of Merneptah (KIU 4246) provides information on the king&#x27;s military exploits.
*At Karnak, the Merneptah Stele (JE 31408) is famous for its mention of &quot;Israel/Yisrael&quot;.
*At Amada, the Fourth Year Text of Merneptah.

==Death==
As soon as Merneptah died the succession apparently had become a problem, he was put in his tomb KV 8 but later removed, and his mummy has survived.

===Succession===
Merneptah was already an elderly man in his late 60s, if not early 70s, when he assumed the throne. 

Merneptah&#x27;s successor, Seti II, was a son of Queen Isetnofret. However, Seti II&#x27;s accession to the throne was not unchallenged: a rival king named Amenmesse, who was either another son of Merneptah by Takhat or, much less likely, of Ramesses II, seized control of Upper Egypt and Kush during the middle of the reign of Seti II. Only after he overcame Amenmesse, was Seti able to reassert his authority over Thebes in his fifth year. It is possible that before seizing Upper Egypt, Amenmesse had been known as Messuy and had been viceroy of Kush.

===Tomb===
At Thebes, the Tomb of Merneptah (KV8) was in the Valley of the Kings.

===Mummy===

Merneptah suffered from arthritis and atherosclerosis and died as an old man after a reign that lasted for nearly a decade. He was originally buried within tomb KV8 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy was not found there. In 1898 it was located along with eighteen other mummies in the mummy cache found in the tomb of Amenhotep II (KV35) by Victor Loret. His mummy was taken to Cairo and eventually unwrapped by G. Elliott Smith on July 8, 1907. Smith notes that:
The body is that of an old man and is 1 meter 714 millimeters [5&#x27;6&quot;] in height. Merneptah was almost completely bald, only a narrow fringe of white hair (now cut so close as to be seen only with difficulty) remaining on the temples and occiput. A few short (about 2 mill) black hairs were found on the upper lip and scattered, closely clipped hairs on the cheeks and chin. The general aspect of the face recalls that of Ramesses II, but the form of the cranium and the measurements of the face much more nearly agree with those of his [grand]father, Seti the Great.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade. 

== Family ==

Merenptah&#x27;s Great Royal Wife was Isetnofret II, who was or his full sister or her niece as daughter of his full brother Khaemwaset. 

They had at least four children: 
* Seti Merenptah, who assume the throne as Seti II;
* Merenptah, King&#x27;s son, Executive at the Head of the Two Lands, and Generalissimo; 
* Khaemwaset, King&#x27;s son, depicted in Karnak Temple; 
* Isetnofret, King&#x27;s daughter, depicted in the Leiden ship log. 
Another his possible consort was Takhat. If so, Merenptah would be the father of her son Amenmesse, Seti II&#x27;s rival for the throne.

<doc id="1168297" wikidata="Q5048495" url="?curid=1168297" title="Casey Donovan (singer)">
<text>Casey Donovan (born 13 May 1988) is an Australian singer, songwriter, actress, theatre actress, and author, best known for winning the second season of the singing competition show &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2004. She won the competition at the age of 16, becoming the series&#x27; youngest winner. In 2017, Donovan won the third series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot;. Donovan also hosted the NITV music show &quot;Fusion with Casey Donovan&quot;.

==Early life==
Casey Donovan was born in Bankstown, New South Wales, of indigenous descent to a family that included several relatives with musical careers, including her father, who along with his brothers are members of the country band The Donovans. It wasn&#x27;t until attending Condell Park High that her talent became noticed and was supported especially by both her mother and stepfather.

==Career==
===2004–2006: &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;For You&quot;===

In 2004, Donovan transferred to the Australian Institute of Music in Sydney and auditioned for the second season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; singing Kasey Chambers&#x27; &quot;A Million Tears&quot;. During the series, Donovan won a Deadly Award for Most Promising New Talent in Music. In November, Donovan was announced the winner of Idol over favourite Anthony Callea. Her success was marred by a typographical mistake by Australian Idol sponsor Telstra, in a half-page nationally run newspaper advertisement including what was assumed to be her website. The link was a memorial for the late American pornography actor of the same name. Telstra apologized for the error.

====&quot;Australian Idol&quot; Performances====
In February 2005, Donovan released &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts. At the Deadly Awards 2005, Donovan won Single Release of the Year for &quot;Listen with Your Heart&quot; and Artist of the Year. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, Donovan was nominated for Highest Selling Single, losing to Anthony Callea&#x27;s &quot;The Prayer&quot;. In 2006, Donovan was dropped from Sony BMG.

===2007–2016: Post-&quot;Idol&quot; Career===

Donovan returned to music with the release of her single &quot;Big, Beautiful &amp; Sexy&quot; written with songwriter Beau Golden, released in August 2010. A Facebook named for the song grew to over 10,000 fans shortly after release. Prior to the song&#x27;s release, Donovan herself lost over 20kg and continued her support larger men and women. Donovan went on to release another single in November 2010 titled &quot;Last Regret,&quot; which gained some commercial airplay.

In December 2010, Donovan was nominated for two awards at the 2010 Sydney Theatre Awards for &quot;Newcomer&quot; and &quot;Supporting Actress&quot;, continuing to receive praise and recognition from the industry for her work in &quot;The Sapphires&quot;. Although she auditioned for a role in the 2011 movie version, Donovan was not cast.

2011 saw Donovan reprise her role of Cynthia Macrae in another tour of &quot;The Sapphires&quot;. The tour ran during February in ACT and NSW, and was followed by two weeks in the UK in March.

In August/September 2011, Donovan created the role of Mama Cass in the world premiere of new musical &quot;Flowerchildren – The Mamas &amp; the Papas Story&quot; written by Peter Fitzpatrick and produced by Australian company Magnormos. She was joined by Matt Hetherington as John Phillips, Laura Fitzpatrick as Michelle Phillips, and Dan Humphris as Denny Doherty.

Donovan also played several roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s As You Like It at Sydney&#x27;s Belvoir Street Theatre.

===2017–2018: &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot;, TV Advertisements and &quot;Lonely&quot;===
In January 2017, Donovan was revealed as a celebrity contestant on the third season of the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. On 13 March 2017, Donovan won the series and was announced as the first ever Queen of the Jungle. In April 2017, Donovan became the face of the Coles Supermarket &quot;Down down&quot; campaign. On 23 April 2017, Donovan performed an acoustic version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; at the 2017 Logie Awards in which she received a standing ovation.
In May 2017 the &quot;Coles&quot;, &quot;Down Down&quot; campaign was refreshed with Casey performing a disco version of the advertisement.
Donovan released her first single in seven years, &quot;Lonely&quot; on 19 May 2017 and &quot;Off the Grid &amp; Somewhere in Between&quot; EP in August 2017.

She performed on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2017 in Sydney, singing &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;.

In 2019 Donovan starred as Mama Morton in the Australian revival of the musical, &quot;Chicago&quot;, which received positive reviews.

In November 2019, Donovan was announced as a participant in &quot;Eurovision - Australia Decides&quot;; in an attempt to represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. She performed the track &quot;Proud&quot; in the national final on 8 February 2020 and placed second.

In 2021, Donovan appeared as Luna Keys in the third season of the comedy TV series &quot;How to Stay Married&quot;, alongside Peter Helliar and Lisa McCune.

From 2004, Donovan was the victim of a six-year-long hoax telephone relationship with a persona named Campbell, constructed by a woman named Olga.

In 2023, Donovan announced she was in a relationship with a woman, whom she met on a dating app during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Donovan often states her support for the queer community as a queer woman herself.

<doc id="1168298" wikidata="Q5324765" url="?curid=1168298" title="EZ TAG">
<text>EZ TAG is an electronic toll collection system in Houston, Texas, United States, that allows motorists to pay tolls without stopping at toll booths. Motorists with the tags are allowed to use lanes reserved exclusively for them on all Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) roads. As of late 2003, the EZ TAG can also be used on all lanes of tolled roadways in Texas that accommodate electronic toll collection.

== How it works ==
To participate, a driver signs up through the EZ TAG website, via telephone, or at one of the store locations. Next, the customer receives a small, white radio frequency transponder which must be affixed to the inside of their windshield behind their rear view mirror. Finally, when passing through a toll plaza, the driver chooses lanes specially equipped with sensors that can read EZ TAG transmitters and deduct the appropriate amount from their accounts.

Houston Transtar uses EZ TAG sensors, which are placed at numerous points across Greater Houston, for their Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) traffic monitoring system. By tracking the movement of individual transponder tags (EZ TAG user vehicles) over the city, the system can generate real time traffic information for use by the general public. The personal information about the EZ TAG customer is not compromised in this process because the EZ TAG database and the AVI system are not interconnected.

==New transponder==
In May 2006, HCTRA introduced a new version of the transponder tag. Instead of battery-powered radio transmitters, the new tags are adhesive stickers with a button-sized microchip in the middle of, and a reflective antenna system throughout the tag. These new tags are sold, rather than rented, so they help save money over the life of the tag by eliminating the monthly $1 rental fee. The battery tag&#x27;s $15 security deposit can be applied to the purchase of the sticker tag.

Removing the sticker after placement has a high probability of either separating the chip from the antenna, de-tuning the antenna from its designated frequency, or both, therefore invalidating the tag for future use. The tag also relies on the windshield for an amplification effect, and its effective range is greatly reduced if it is not mounted on a glass substrate. This range reduction is so much that not having a tag properly mounted will result in it not reading at all in toll lanes. 

These characteristics are much different compared to the old battery tags, which would read fine if not mounted properly. As such, some toll patrons attempt to hold up their sticker tags when driving through the toll lanes, and appear mystified when they do not work as their old tags did.

The new tag uses three different protocols, or communications methods, with the tag readers—ATA, eGo and SeGo.

The protocol used in Houston is ATA for automatic equipment identification; however, a driver in Houston can conceivably use the tag in another state where the other protocols are used. In addition, the tags support ANSI INCITS 256-2001 and ISO 10374. The tag is read by scanners as far as at 915 MHz, and the tag features a 2048-bit read/write passive memory.

To duplicate a 915 MHz EZ TAG, a copy of the ROM 2048-bit chip must be dumped and loaded into another ROM chip and a matched inductance of the RFID EZ TAG surface needs to be constructed. Blank 915 MHz RFID pads can be bought online.

=== New variations ===
As of January 2008, three different sets of EZ Tags have been released. The differences are purely cosmetic.

Despite the similarity in the names, EZ Tags are not compatible with the E-ZPass system in the northeast U.S.

===EZ Tag by BancPass===
In November 2015, HCTRA announced a new Cash Reloadable EZ Tag. The EZ Tag by BancPass can be reloaded with cash at major retailers, or the user can reload online using a debit or credit card. The EZ Tag by BancPass also differs from the standard EZ Tag by not reloading automatically. The user is notified when the account balance gets low, and the user can choose when and how much to put on the user&#x27;s account.

The EZ Tag by BancPass is available online, at H-E-B grocery stores and at Corner Store by Valero. Accounts can be reloaded online or at any H-E-B, CVS or Corner Store by Valero.

<doc id="1168300" wikidata="Q679355" url="?curid=1168300" title="Amber (color)">
<text>The color amber is a pure chroma color, located on the color wheel midway between the colors of yellow and orange. The color name is derived from the material also known as amber, which is commonly found in a range of yellow-orange-brown-red colors; likewise, as a color, &quot;amber&quot; can refer to a range of yellow-orange colors. In English, the first recorded use of the term as a color name, rather than a reference to the specific substance, was in 1500.

==SAE/ECE amber==

Amber is one of several technically defined colors used in automotive signal lamps. In North America, SAE standard J578 governs the colorimetry of vehicle lights, while outside North America the internationalized European ECE regulations hold force. Both standards designate a range of orange-yellow hues in the CIE color space as &quot;amber&quot;.

In the past, the ECE amber definition was more restrictive than the SAE definition, but the current ECE definition is identical to the more permissive SAE standard. The SAE formally uses the term &quot;yellow amber&quot;, though the color is most often referred to as &quot;yellow&quot;. This is not the same as selective yellow, a color used in some fog lamps and headlamps.

===Formal definitions===
Previously, ECE amber was defined according to the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic, as follows:

Recent revisions to the ECE regulations have aligned ECE Amber with SAE Yellow, defined as follows:

The entirety of these definitions lie outside the gamut of the sRGB color space — such a pure color cannot be represented using RGB primaries. The color box shown above is a desaturated approximation, produced by taking the centroid of the standard definition and moving it towards the D65 white point, until it meets the sRGB gamut triangle.

== Lighting ==
The color temperature of LED lamps is called amber when their wavelengths are about 590 nm. Chronomatic low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps emit light ranging from 580 to 590 nm.

==Cultural use==
Computers
* The Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VT220 computer terminals were available with amber phosphors in their CRTs.
Interior design
* The original Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg was a complete chamber decoration of amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors. Due to its singular beauty, it was sometimes dubbed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;.
Sports
* In Gaelic games, Armagh play in a darker amber color (the amber that is prevalent in the Irish flag), Offaly play in the original colors of the Irish flag (green, white and amber) and Kilkenny also play in black and amber, albeit a more yellow amber.
* Amber is a color worn by English football clubs Hull City AFC, Bradford City AFC, Barnet FC, Shrewsbury Town FC (As part of stripes), Mansfield Town, Cambridge United FC and Sutton United. Everton has incorporated amber in away and thirds kits, and as an accent color, since at least 1967. The color is also worn by the Scottish football club Motherwell FC, as well as many other sports clubs around the world.
Traffic engineering

* Amber is used in traffic lights and turn signals.
Theatre
* Amber, sometimes named &quot;Bastard Amber&quot;, along with &#x27;Moonlight Blue&#x27;, is one of the two most common colors used in stage lighting.

<text>Alan Rhun Watkins (3 April 1933 – 8 May 2010) was for over 50 years a British political columnist in various London-based magazines and newspapers. He also wrote about wine and rugby.

==Life and career==
Alan Watkins was born in Tycroes, Carmarthenshire, to David John Watkins (1894–1980), a teacher (sometime headmaster at Llanedi School, near Tycroes), from a mining family, and Violet, also a teacher, daughter of Dr Edwin Harris, a GP. He was educated at Tycroes Primary School and Amman Valley Grammar School before studying law at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. After National Service, he was called to the Bar.

Much of his long career as a commentator on politics was spent at &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper (1976–93), but he also wrote for &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; (1959–64), &quot;The Spectator&quot; (1964–67), the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (1967–76), the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, and the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

At the end of each year he wrote a piece called &quot;Master Alan Watkins&#x27; Almanack&quot;, written in the style of a 17th-century seer and making tentative, and slightly tongue-in-cheek, predictions for the year ahead.

=== Political language ===
He coined and popularised a number of phrases that have passed into common journalistic parlance, including &quot;chattering classes&quot;; although he fleshed out the archetypal &quot;young fogey&quot; in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1984, Watkins noted that he had adopted the phrase from the journalist Terence Kilmartin, who had used it in reference to the academic John Casey, and Watkins stated that the phrase originated with Dornford Yates in 1928.

He was noted for coining the political phrase &quot;the men in grey suits&quot;, indicating a delegation of senior party figures (such as the Conservative Party&#x27;s 1922 Committee) who come to tell a party leader that it is time to go. But as he wrote in a footnote in &quot;A Conservative Coup&quot;:

The original phrase was &#x27;the men in suits&#x27;. It was used, for example, by the present writer in the &quot;Observer&quot;, 6 May 1990. During and before the 39 hours it became transformed into &#x27;the men in grey suits&#x27;, which stuck. As Lord Whitelaw observed on television, it was an inaccurate phrase, because on the day in question, 21 November, his interviewer could see that he was wearing a blue suit. And, indeed, the typical Conservative grandee tends to wear a dark blue or black suit, with chalk- or pin-stripes, what may be called a White&#x27;s Club suit. The original phrase &#x27;the men in suits&#x27; is the more accurate.

==Death==
Watkins was in failing health for several weeks prior to his death at his London home on 8 May 2010 from renal failure, aged 77. He was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="1168304" wikidata="Q3545481" url="?curid=1168304" title="Surgical oncology">
<text>Surgical oncology is the branch of surgery applied to oncology; it focuses on the surgical management of tumors, especially cancerous tumors.

As one of several modalities in the management of cancer, the specialty of surgical oncology has evolved in steps similar to medical oncology (pharmacotherapy for cancer), which grew out of hematology, and radiation oncology, which grew out of radiology. The Ewing Society—known today as the Society of Surgical Oncology—was started by surgeons interested in promoting the field of oncology. In 2011, the American Board of Surgery ratified Complex General Surgical Oncology via a specialty Board certification. The field was expected to continue expanding via the proliferation of cancer centers, as well as advanced minimally invasive techniques, palliative surgery, and neo-adjuvant treatments.

==Debate==
Whether surgical oncology constitutes a medical specialty &quot;per se&quot; is the topic of a heated debate. Today, some would agree that it is simply impossible for any one surgeon to be competent in the surgical management of &quot;all&quot; malignant disease. There are currently 19 surgical oncology fellowship training programs in the United States that have been approved by the Society of Surgical Oncology and this number is expect to grow. While many general surgeons are actively involved in treating patients with malignant neoplasms, the designation of &quot;surgical oncologist&quot; is generally reserved for those surgeons who have completed one of the approved fellowship programs. However, this is a matter of semantics, as many surgeons who are thoroughly involved in treating cancer patients may consider themselves to be surgical oncologists.

Most often, &quot;surgical oncologist&quot; refers to a general surgical oncologist (a subspecialty of general surgery), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologic oncologists and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients.

==Training==
The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume—i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted—even as common sense—that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as, Breast Cancer Surgery, pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. In the United States and Canada, fellowship trained surgical oncologists have among the longest training periods of any physicians/surgeons. In some areas like Breast Diseases and Breast Cancer there we know as Breast Surgeon the specialist that only works with patients with breast diseases and breast cancer. A training period (clinical and research) of 6 to 8 years is typical and 8–10 years is not uncommon.

==Surgical oncology types and forms==
These are the most common types and forms of oncological surgery:
* surgery to diagnose cancer
* surgery to stage cancer
* curative surgery
:*radical surgery
* surgery to debulk cancer
* palliative surgery
* supportive surgery
* reconstructive surgery
* preventive (prophylactic) surgery.

==Surgical oncology techniques==
Newer surgical techniques are less invasive, use different types of surgical instruments, and lead to less pain and shorter recovery times. The most effective surgical oncology techniques are: 
* cryosurgery
* electrosurgery
* laparoscopic surgery
* laser surgery
* mohs surgery
* radiofrequency ablation
* robotic surgery and other forms of surgery.
* thoracoscopic surgery

==Books==
One of the first text books dedicated to surgical oncology was written by the American-Irish surgeon, Theodore O&#x27;Connell in 1981. Many publications in surgical oncology are also appearing. The majority are large reference textbooks that seemingly combine specialties that are not generally practiced by a single practitioner but cover the academic subject. A number of practical handbooks such as &quot;surgical oncology&quot; in the well read Oxford Handbooks series, have recently been published, perhaps alluding to the evolving practicality of this emerging discipline.

<doc id="1168317" wikidata="Q309082" url="?curid=1168317" title="Mirror neuron">
<text>A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron &quot;mirrors&quot; the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Mirror neurons are not always physiologically distinct from other types of neurons in the brain; their main differentiating factor is their response patterns. By this definition, such neurons have been directly observed in humans and other primates, as well as in birds.

In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the inferior parietal cortex. The function of the mirror system in humans is a subject of much speculation. Birds have been shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence suggests the presence of some form of mirroring system.
To date, no widely accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity supports cognitive functions. 

The subject of mirror neurons continues to generate intense debate. In 2014, &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&quot; published a special issue entirely devoted to mirror neuron research. Some researchers speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills, while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain help humans understand the actions and intentions of other people. In addition, Iacoboni has argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as empathy.

==Discovery==
In the 1980s and 1990s, neurophysiologists Giacomo Rizzolatti, Giuseppe Di Pellegrino, Luciano Fadiga, Leonardo Fogassi, and Vittorio Gallese at the University of Parma placed electrodes in the ventral premotor cortex of the macaque monkey to study neurons specialized in the control of hand and mouth actions; for example, taking hold of an object and manipulating it. During each experiment, the researchers allowed the monkey to reach for pieces of food, and recorded from single neurons in the monkey&#x27;s brain, thus measuring the neuron&#x27;s response to certain movements. They found that some neurons responded when the monkey observed a person picking up a piece of food, and also when the monkey itself picked up the food.
The discovery was initially submitted to &quot;Nature&quot;, but was rejected for its &quot;lack of general interest&quot; before being published in a less competitive journal.

A few years later, the same group published another empirical paper, discussing the role of the mirror-neuron system in action recognition, and proposing that the human Broca&#x27;s area was the homologue region of the monkey ventral premotor cortex.
While these papers reported the presence of mirror neurons responding to hand actions, a subsequent study by Pier Francesco Ferrari and colleagues described the presence of mirror neurons responding to mouth actions and facial gestures.

Further experiments confirmed that about 10% of neurons in the monkey inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex have &quot;mirror&quot; properties and give similar responses to performed hand actions and observed actions. In 2002 Christian Keysers and colleagues reported that, in both humans and monkeys, the mirror system also responds to the sound of actions.

Reports on mirror neurons have been widely published and confirmed with mirror neurons found in both inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions of the brain. Recently, evidence from functional neuroimaging strongly suggests that humans have similar mirror neurons systems: researchers have identified brain regions which respond during both action and observation of action. Not surprisingly, these brain regions include those found in the macaque monkey. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can examine the entire brain at once and suggests that a much wider network of brain areas shows mirror properties in humans than previously thought. These additional areas include the somatosensory cortex and are thought to make the observer feel what it feels like to move in the observed way.

==Origin==
Many implicitly assume that the mirroring function of mirror neurons is due primarily to heritable genetic factors and that the genetic predisposition to develop mirror neurons evolved because they facilitate action understanding. In contrast, a number of theoretical accounts argue that mirror neurons could simply emerge due to learned associations, including the Hebbian Theory, the Associative Learning Theory, and Canalization.

==In monkeys==

The first animal in which researchers have studied mirror neurons individually is the macaque monkey. In these monkeys, mirror neurons are found in the inferior frontal gyrus (region F5) and the inferior parietal lobule.

Mirror neurons are believed to mediate the understanding of other animals&#x27; behaviour. For example, a mirror neuron which fires when the monkey rips a piece of paper would also fire when the monkey sees a person rip paper, or hears paper ripping (without visual cues). These properties have led researchers to believe that mirror neurons encode abstract concepts of actions like &#x27;ripping paper&#x27;, whether the action is performed by the monkey or another animal.

The function of mirror neurons in macaques remains unknown. Adult macaques do not seem to learn by imitation. Recent experiments by Ferrari and colleagues suggest that infant macaques can imitate a human&#x27;s face movements, though only as neonates and during a limited temporal window. Even if it has not yet been empirically demonstrated, it has been proposed that mirror neurons cause this behaviour and other imitative phenomena. Indeed, there is limited understanding of the degree to which monkeys show imitative behaviour.

In adult monkeys, mirror neurons may enable the monkey to understand what another monkey is doing, or to recognize the other monkey&#x27;s action.

==In rodents==
A number of studies have shown that rats and mice show signs of distress while witnessing another rodent receive footshocks. The group of Christian Keysers&#x27;s recorded from neurons while rats experienced pain or witnessed the pain of others, and has revealed the presence of pain mirror neurons in the rat&#x27;s anterior cingulate cortex, i.e. neurons that respond both while an animal experiences pain and while witnessing the pain of others. Deactivating this region of the cingulate cortex led to reduced emotional contagion in the rats, so that observer rats showed reduced distress while witnessing another rat experience pain. The homologous part of the anterior cingulate cortex has been associated with empathy for pain in humans, suggesting a homology between the systems involved in emotional contagion in rodents and empathy/emotional contagion for pain in humans.

==In humans==
It is not normally possible to study single neurons in the human brain, so most evidence for mirror neurons in humans is indirect. Brain imaging experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the human inferior frontal cortex and superior parietal lobe are active when the person performs an action and also when the person sees another individual performing an action. It has been suggested that these brain regions contain mirror neurons, and they have been defined as the human mirror neuron system. More recent experiments have shown that even at the level of single participants, scanned using fMRI, large areas containing multiple fMRI voxels increase their activity both during the observation and execution of actions.

Neuropsychological studies looking at lesion areas that cause action knowledge, pantomime interpretation, and biological motion perception deficits have pointed to a causal link between the integrity of the inferior frontal gyrus and these behaviours. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have confirmed this as well. These results indicate the activation in mirror neuron related areas are unlikely to be just epiphenomenal.

A study published in April 2010 reports recordings from single neurons with mirror properties in the human brain. Mukamel &quot;et al.&quot; (Current Biology, 2010) recorded from the brains of 21 patients who were being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for intractable epilepsy. The patients had been implanted with intracranial depth electrodes to identify seizure foci for potential surgical treatment. Electrode location was based solely on clinical criteria; the researchers, with the patients&#x27; consent, used the same electrodes to &quot;piggyback&quot; their research. The researchers found a small number of neurons that fired or showed their greatest activity both when the individual performed a task and when they observed a task. Other neurons had anti-mirror properties: they responded when the participant performed an action, but were inhibited when the participant saw that action.

The mirror neurons found were located in the supplementary motor area and medial temporal cortex (other brain regions were not sampled). For purely practical reasons, these regions are not the same as those in which mirror neurons had been recorded from in the monkey: researchers in Parma were studying the ventral premotor cortex and the associated inferior parietal lobe, two regions in which epilepsy rarely occurs, and hence, single cell recordings in these regions are not usually done in humans. On the other hand, no one has to date looked for mirror neurons in the supplementary motor area or the medial temporal lobe in the monkey. Together, this therefore does not suggest that humans and monkeys have mirror neurons in different locations, but rather that they may have mirror neurons both in the ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe, where they have been recorded in the monkey, and in the supplementary motor areas and medial temporal lobe, where they have been recorded from in human – especially because detailed human fMRI analyses suggest activity compatible with the presence of mirror neurons in all these regions.

Another study has suggested that human beings do not necessarily have more mirror neurons than monkeys, but instead that there is a core set of mirror neurons used in action observation and execution. However, for other proposed functions of mirror neurons the mirror system may have the ability to recruit other areas of the brain when doing its auditory, somatosensory, and affective components.

===Development===
Human infant data using eye-tracking measures suggest that the mirror neuron system develops before 12 months of age and that this system may help human infants understand other people&#x27;s actions. A critical question concerns how mirror neurons acquire mirror properties. Two closely related models postulate that mirror neurons are trained through Hebbian or Associative learning (see Associative Sequence Learning). However, if premotor neurons need to be trained by action in order to acquire mirror properties, it is unclear how newborn babies are able to mimic the facial gestures of another person (imitation of unseen actions), as suggested by the work of Meltzoff and Moore. One possibility is that the sight of tongue protrusion recruits an innate releasing mechanism in neonates. Careful analysis suggests that &#x27;imitation&#x27; of this single gesture may account for almost all reports of facial mimicry by new-born infants.

== Possible functions ==

=== Understanding intentions ===
Many studies link mirror neurons to understanding goals and intentions. Fogassi et al. (2005) recorded the activity of 41 mirror neurons in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) of two rhesus macaques. The IPL has long been recognized as an association cortex that integrates sensory information. The monkeys watched an experimenter either grasp an apple and bring it to his mouth or grasp an object and place it in a cup.
* In total, 15 mirror neurons fired vigorously when the monkey observed the &quot;grasp-to-eat&quot; motion, but registered no activity while exposed to the &quot;grasp-to-place&quot; condition.
* For 4 other mirror neurons, the reverse held true: they activated in response to the experimenter eventually placing the apple in the cup but not to eating it.

Only the type of action, and not the kinematic force with which models manipulated objects, determined neuron activity. It was also significant that neurons fired before the monkey observed the human model starting the second motor act (bringing the object to the mouth or placing it in a cup). Therefore, IPL neurons &quot;code the same act (grasping) in a different way according to the final goal of the action in which the act is embedded.&quot; They may furnish a neural basis for predicting another individual&#x27;s subsequent actions and inferring intention.

Understanding intention can be broken down into various stages such as body perception and action identification. These stages correlate with various regions of the brain, for example for body parts/shapes match with the extrastriate and fusiform body areas of the brain. The action itself is identified and facilitated by the mirror neuron system. Action understanding falls into two different processing levels, the mirror neuron system and the mentalizing system. Expected actions are primarily processed by the mirror neuron system and unexpected actions are processed by a combination of the mirror neuron system and the mentalizing system.

=== Learning facilitation ===
Another possible function of mirror neurons would be facilitation of learning. The mirror neurons code the concrete representation of the action, i.e., the representation that would be activated if the observer acted. This would allow us to simulate (to repeat internally) the observed action implicitly (in the brain) to collect our own motor programs of observed actions and to get ready to reproduce the actions later. It is implicit training. Due to this, the observer will produce the action explicitly (in his/her behavior) with agility and finesse. This happens due to associative learning processes. The more frequently a synaptic connection is activated, the stronger it becomes.

=== Empathy ===
Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal, Jean Decety, and Vittorio Gallese and Christian Keysers have independently argued that the mirror neuron system is involved in empathy. A large number of experiments using fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have shown that certain brain regions (in particular the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal cortex) are active when people experience an emotion (disgust, happiness, pain, etc.) and when they see another person experiencing an emotion.
David Freedberg and Vittorio Gallese have also put forward the idea that this function of the mirror neuron system is crucial for aesthetic experiences. Nevertheless, an experiment aimed at investigating the activity of mirror neurons in empathy conducted by Soukayna Bekkali and Peter Enticott at the University of Deakin yielded a different result. After analyzing the report&#x27;s data, they came up with two conclusions about motor empathy and emotional empathy. First, there is no relationship between motor empathy and the activity of mirror neurons. Second, there is only weak evidence of these neurons&#x27; activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and no evidence of emotional empathy associated with mirror neurons in key brain regions (inferior parietal lobule: IPL). In other words, there has not been an exact conclusion about the role of mirror neurons in empathy and if they are essential for human empathy. However, these brain regions are not quite the same as the ones which mirror hand actions, and mirror neurons for emotional states or empathy have not yet been described in monkeys.

In a recent study, done in 2022, sixteen hand actions were given for each assignment. The assignment pictured both an activity word phase and the intended word phase. The hand actions were selected in &quot;trails&quot; each introduced twice. One of the times was with a matching phase and the other time was with a misleading word phase. The action words were depicted in two to three words with each beginning with the word &quot;to&quot;. For instance, &quot;to point&quot; (action) or &quot;to spin&quot; (intention).

Participants were expected to answer whether the correct word phase matched the corresponding action or intention word. The word phase had to be answered within 3000 ms, with a 1000 ms black screen between each image. The black screens purpose was for an adequate amount of time in between responses. Participants pressed on the keyboard &quot;x&quot; or &quot;m&quot; to indicate their responses in a yes/no format.

Christian Keysers at the Social Brain Lab and colleagues have shown that people who are more empathic according to self-report questionnaires have stronger activations both in the mirror system for hand actions and the mirror system for emotions, providing more direct support for the idea that the mirror system is linked to empathy.
Some researchers observed that the human mirror system does not passively respond to the observation of actions but is influenced by the mindset of the observer. Researchers observed the link of the mirror neurons during empathetic engagement in patient care.

Studies in rats have shown that the anterior cingulate cortex contains mirror neurons for pain, i.e. neurons responding both during the first-hand experience of pain and while witnessing the pain of others, and inhibition of this region leads to reduced emotional contagion in rats and mice, and reduced aversion towards harming others. This provides causal evidence for a link between pain mirror neurons, and emotional contagion and prosocial behavior, two phenomena associated with empathy, in rodents. That brain activity in the homologous brain region is associated with individual variability in empathy in humans suggests that a similar mechanism may be at play across mammals.

===Human self awareness===
V. S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of human self-awareness. In an essay written for the Edge Foundation in 2009 Ramachandran gave the following explanation of his theory: &quot;... I also speculated that these neurons can not only help simulate other people&#x27;s behavior but can be turned &#x27;inward&#x27;—as it were—to create second-order representations or meta-representations of your &quot;own&quot; earlier brain processes. This could be the neural basis of introspection, and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness. There is obviously a chicken-or-egg question here as to which evolved first, but... The main point is that the two co-evolved, mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans.&quot;

===Language===
In humans, functional MRI studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system in the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca&#x27;s area, one of the hypothesized language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people&#x27;s behaviour. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca&#x27;s area. Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, fast and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echolalia.

Further evidence for this link comes from a recent study in which the brain activity of two participants was measured using fMRI while they were gesturing words to each other using hand gestures with a game of charades – a modality that some have suggested might represent the evolutionary precursor of human language. Analysis of the data using Granger Causality revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system

The mirror neuron system seems to be inherently inadequate to play any role in syntax, given that this definitory property of human languages which is implemented in hierarchical recursive structure is flattened into linear sequences of phonemes making the recursive structure not accessible to sensory detection

===Automatic imitation===
The term is commonly used to refer to cases in which an individual, having observed a body movement, unintentionally performs a similar body movement or alters the way that a body movement is performed. Automatic imitation rarely involves overt execution of matching responses. Instead the effects typically consist of reaction time, rather than accuracy, differences between compatible and incompatible trials.
Research reveals that the existence of automatic imitation, which is a covert form of imitation, is distinct from spatial compatibility. It also indicates that, although automatic imitation is subject to input modulation by attentional processes, and output modulation by inhibitory processes, it is mediated by learned, long-term sensorimotor associations that cannot be altered directly by intentional processes. Many researchers believe that automatic imitation is mediated by the mirror neuron system. Additionally, there are data that demonstrate that our postural control is impaired when people listen to sentences about other actions. For example, if the task is to maintain posture, people do it worse when they listen to sentences like this: &quot;I get up, put on my slippers, go to the bathroom.&quot; This phenomenon may be due to the fact that during action perception there is similar motor cortex activation as if a human being performed the same action (mirror neurons system).

===Motor mimicry===
In contrast with automatic imitation, motor mimicry is observed in (1) naturalistic social situations and (2) via measures of action frequency within a session rather than measures of speed and/or accuracy within trials.

The integration of research on motor mimicry and automatic imitation could reveal plausible indications that these phenomena depend on the same psychological and neural processes. Preliminary evidence however comes from studies showing that social priming has similar effects on motor mimicry.

Nevertheless, the similarities between automatic imitation, mirror effects, and motor mimicry have led some researchers to propose that automatic imitation is mediated by the mirror neuron system and that it is a tightly controlled laboratory equivalent of the motor mimicry observed in naturalistic social contexts. If true, then automatic imitation can be used as a tool to investigate how the mirror neuron system contributes to cognitive functioning and how motor mimicry promotes prosocial attitudes and behavior.

Meta-analysis of imitation studies in humans suggest that there is enough evidence of mirror system activation during imitation that mirror neuron involvement is likely, even though no published studies have recorded the activities of singular neurons. However, it is likely insufficient for motor imitation. Studies show that regions of the frontal and parietal lobes that extend beyond the classical mirror system are equally activated during imitation. This suggests that other areas, along with the mirror system are crucial to imitation behaviors.

===Autism===

It has also been proposed that problems with the mirror neuron system may underlie cognitive disorders, particularly autism. However the connection between mirror neuron dysfunction and autism is tentative and it remains to be demonstrated how mirror neurons are related to many of the important characteristics of autism.

Some researchers claim there is a link between mirror neuron deficiency and autism. EEG recordings from motor areas are suppressed when someone watches another person move, a signal that may relate to mirror neuron system. Additionally, the correlation can be measured with eye-movement tracking of biological motions, together with EEG recordings, mu suppression index can be calculated. This suppression was less in children with autism. Although these findings have been replicated by several groups, other studies have not found evidence of a dysfunctional mirror neuron system in autism. In 2008, Oberman et al. published a research paper that presented conflicting EEG evidence. Oberman and Ramachandran found typical mu-suppression for familiar stimuli, but not for unfamiliar stimuli, leading them to conclude that the mirror neuron system of children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) was functional, but less sensitive than that of typical children. Based on the conflicting evidence presented by mu-wave suppression experiments, Patricia Churchland has cautioned that mu-wave suppression results cannot be used as a valid index for measuring the performance of mirror neuron systems. Recent research indicates that mirror neurons do not play a role in autism:

Some anatomical differences have been found in the mirror neuron related brain areas in adults with autism spectrum disorders, compared to non-autistic adults. All these cortical areas were thinner and the degree of thinning was correlated with autism symptom severity, a correlation nearly restricted to these brain regions. Based on these results, some researchers claim that autism is caused by impairments in the mirror neuron system, leading to disabilities in social skills, imitation, empathy and theory of mind.

Many researchers have pointed out that the &quot;broken mirrors&quot; theory of autism is overly simplistic, and mirror neurons alone cannot explain the differences found in individuals with autism. First of all, as noted above, none of these studies were direct measures of mirror neuron activity - in other words fMRI activity or EEG rhythm suppression do not unequivocally index mirror neurons. Dinstein and colleagues found normal mirror neuron activity in people with autism using fMRI. In individuals with autism, deficits in intention understanding, action understanding and biological motion perception (the key functions of mirror neurons) are not always found, or are task dependent. Today, very few people believe an all-or-nothing problem with the mirror system can underlie autism. Instead, &quot;additional research needs to be done, and more caution should be used when reaching out to the media.&quot;

Research from 2010 concluded that autistic individuals do not exhibit mirror neuron dysfunction, although the small sample size limits the extent to which these results can be generalized. A more recent review argued there was not enough neurological evidence to support this “broken-mirror theory” of autism.

===Theory of mind===
In Philosophy of mind, mirror neurons have become the primary rallying call of simulation theorists concerning our &quot;theory of mind.&quot; &quot;Theory of mind&quot; refers to our ability to infer another person&#x27;s mental state (i.e., beliefs and desires) from experiences or their behaviour.

There are several competing models which attempt to account for our theory of mind; the most notable in relation to mirror neurons is simulation theory. According to simulation theory, theory of mind is available because we subconsciously empathize with the person we&#x27;re observing and, accounting for relevant differences, imagine what we would desire and believe in that scenario. Mirror neurons have been interpreted as the mechanism by which we simulate others in order to better understand them, and therefore their discovery has been taken by some as a validation of simulation theory (which appeared a decade before the discovery of mirror neurons). More recently, Theory of Mind and Simulation have been seen as complementary systems, with different developmental time courses.

At the neuronal-level, in a 2015 study by Keren Haroush and Ziv Williams using jointly interacting primates performing an iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game, the authors identified neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex that selectively predicted an opponent&#x27;s yet unknown decisions or covert state of mind. These &quot;other-predictive neurons&quot; differentiated between self and other decisions and were uniquely sensitive to social context, but they did not encode the opponent&#x27;s observed actions or receipt of reward. These cingulate cells may therefore importantly complement the function of mirror neurons by providing additional information about other social agents that is not immediately observable or known.

===Sex differences===
A series of recent studies conducted by Yawei Cheng, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including MEG, spinal reflex excitability, electroencephalography, have documented the presence of a gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants exhibiting stronger motor resonance than male participants.

In another study, sex-based differences among mirror neuron mechanisms was reinforced in that the data showed enhanced empathetic ability in females relative to males. During an emotional social interaction, females showed a greater ability in emotional perspective taking than did males when interacting with another person face-to-face. However, in the study, data showed that when it came to recognizing the emotions of others, all participants&#x27; abilities were very similar and there was no key difference between the male and female subjects.

=== Sleep paralysis ===
Baland Jalal and V. S. Ramachandran have hypothesized that the mirror neuron system is important in giving rise to the intruder hallucination and out-of-body experiences during sleep paralysis. According to this theory, sleep paralysis leads to disinhibition of the mirror neuron system, paving the way for hallucinations of human-like shadowy beings. The deafferentation of sensory information during sleep paralysis is proposed as the mechanism for such mirror neuron disinhibition. The authors suggest that their hypothesis on the role of the mirror neuron system could be tested: 

=== Mirror neuron function, psychosis, and empathy in schizophrenia ===

Recent research, which measured mu-wave suppression, suggests that mirror neuron activity is positively correlated with psychotic symptoms (i.e., greater mu suppression/mirror neuron activity was highest among subjects with the greater severity of psychotic symptoms). Researchers concluded that &quot;higher mirror neuron activity may be the underpinning of schizophrenia sensory gating deficits and may contribute to sensory misattributions particularly in response to socially relevant stimuli, and be a putative mechanism for delusions and hallucinations.&quot;

==Doubts concerning mirror neurons==
Although some in the scientific community have expressed excitement about the discovery of mirror neurons, there are scientists who have expressed doubts about both the existence and role of mirror neurons in humans. The consensus today seems to be that the importance of so-called mirror neurons is widely overblown. According to scientists such as Hickok, Pascolo, and Dinstein, it is not clear whether mirror neurons really form a distinct class of cells (as opposed to an occasional phenomenon seen in cells that have other functions), and whether mirror activity is a distinct type of response or simply an artifact of an overall facilitation of the motor system.

In 2008, Ilan Dinstein et al. argued that the original analyses were unconvincing because they were based on qualitative descriptions of individual cell properties, and did not take into account the small number of strongly mirror-selective neurons in motor areas. Other scientists have argued that the measurements of neuron fire delay seem not to be compatible with standard reaction times, and pointed out that nobody has reported that an interruption of the motor areas in F5 would produce a decrease in action recognition. (Critics of this argument have replied that these authors have missed human neuropsychological and TMS studies reporting disruption of these areas do indeed cause action deficits without affecting other kinds of perception.)

In 2009, Lingnau et al. carried out an experiment in which they compared motor acts that were first observed and then executed to motor acts that were first executed and then observed. They concluded that there was a significant asymmetry between the two processes that indicated that mirror neurons do not exist in humans. They stated &quot;Crucially, we found no signs of adaptation for motor acts that were first executed and then observed. Failure to find cross-modal adaptation for executed and observed motor acts is not compatible with the core assumption
of mirror neuron theory, which holds that action recognition and understanding are based on motor simulation.&quot; However, in the same year, Kilner et al. showed that if goal directed actions are used as stimuli, both IPL and premotor regions show the repetition suppression between observation and execution that is predicted by mirror neurons.

In 2009, Greg Hickok published an extensive argument against the claim that mirror neurons are involved in action-understanding: &quot;Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans.&quot; He concluded that &quot;The early hypothesis that these cells underlie action understanding is likewise an interesting and prima facie reasonable idea. However, despite its widespread acceptance, the proposal has never been adequately tested in monkeys, and in humans there is strong empirical evidence, in the form of physiological and neuropsychological (double-) dissociations, against the claim.&quot;
Vladimir Kosonogov sees another contradiction. The proponents of mirror neuron theory of action understanding postulate that the mirror neurons code the goals of others&#x27; actions because they are activated if the observed action is goal-directed. However, the mirror neurons are activated only when the observed action is goal-directed (object-directed action or a communicative gesture, which certainly has a goal too). How do they &quot;know&quot; that the definite action is goal-directed? At what stage of their activation do they detect a goal of the movement or its absence? In his opinion, the mirror neuron system can be activated only after the goal of the observed action is attributed by some other brain structures.

Neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland have expressed both scientific and philosophical objections to the theory that mirror neurons are responsible for understanding the intentions of others. In chapter 5 of her 2011 book, Braintrust, Churchland points out that the claim that mirror neurons are involved in understanding intentions (through simulating observed actions) is based on assumptions that are clouded by unresolved philosophical issues. She makes the argument that intentions are understood (coded) at a more complex level of neural activity than that of individual neurons. Churchland states that &quot;A neuron, though computationally complex, is just a neuron. It is not an intelligent homunculus. If a neural network represents something complex, such as an intention [to insult], it must have the right input and be in the right place in the neural circuitry to do that.&quot;

Cecilia Heyes has advanced the theory that mirror neurons are the byproduct of associative learning as opposed to evolutionary adaptation. She argues that mirror neurons in humans are the product of social interaction and not an evolutionary adaptation for action-understanding. In particular, Heyes rejects the theory advanced by V.S. Ramachandran that mirror neurons have been &quot;the driving force behind the great leap forward in human evolution.&quot;

<text>Pudding Mill Lane is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Stratford in London, England. It opened in 1996 on the road of the same name, once a light industrial area in Stratford, now being redeveloped into housing development called Pudding Mill Lane. It is next to the Olympic Park; however, it was closed for the duration of the 2012 Olympic Games and reopened on 12 September 2012. The original island platform station was permanently closed on 18 April 2014 in order to allow for the construction of a ramp from the new Crossrail portal nearby. A new, larger station built a short distance to the south opened on 28 April 2014.

The station is located on the DLR&#x27;s Stratford to Poplar branch, between the Bow Church and Stratford stations and is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3. Trains also run to Lewisham in the morning peaks.

==History==

===Original station===

The plans for the DLR to Stratford included an option for a station at Pudding Mill Lane. Funding was not available to build the station, but the location was one of two places safeguarded for future development, the other being Langdon Park.

Pudding Mill Lane was opened on 15 January 1996. Previously this location had been a simple passing point for trains on the otherwise single-tracked section between Stratford and Bow Church.

The name of the station is taken from the nearby Pudding Mill Lane which, in turn, takes its name from the former Pudding Mill River, a minor tributary of the River Lea. This is believed to have taken its name from St. Thomas&#x27;s Mill, a local water mill shaped like a pudding and commonly known as Pudding Mill. The area had also been called Knob Hill up until the 1890s.

When all the other platforms on the DLR&#x27;s Stratford branch were extended to accommodate three-car trains, Pudding Mill Lane remained with a two-car platform, instead using selective door operation. The lack of platform extensions in this case was due to the pending rebuild of the station.

During the 2012 Olympic Games, Pudding Mill Lane station was temporarily closed for safety reasons as, while ideally situated to serve the Olympic site, it was far too small to cope with the probable passenger numbers.

The original station closed after the last train departed at 00:47 on 17/18 April 2014, and its replacement opened on 28 April.

===New station===

Crossrail has a tunnel portal to the east of the original Pudding Mill Lane site. The ramp from the portal to track level at Stratford station passes directly through the original Pudding Mill lane station site, thus required a replacement station to be built on a new viaduct nearby. The original station was demolished to make way for the new ramp, funded as part of the Crossrail project. This work also permitted the upgrade of the only significant stretch of single track left on the DLR to be doubled.

In July 2011, Newham Council&#x27;s Strategic Development Committee approved plans by architect Weston Williamson for the new station. Sited just to the south of the old station, between the River Lea and City Mill River, it was built with a higher capacity to cope for new developments in the area. It has three-car platforms, better pedestrian links and access to buses, improved step-free access, and provision for escalators.

The station was flooded after torrential rain on 25 July 2021.

In May 2022, the station became the principal point of arrival for concert goers at the ABBA Arena, constructed across the road. An ABBA Voyage merchandise shop was subsequently opened in the station entrance. 

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Pudding Mill Lane is:
* 12 tph to 
* 12 tph to Canary Wharf

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours extended beyond Canary Wharf to and from .

<text>The Elsecar Heritage Railway (EHR) is located on the southern part of the former South Yorkshire Railway freight-only branch which ran from Elsecar Junction on its Mexborough to Barnsley Line.

The Elsecar Heritage Railway operated an out and back tourist train ride on a section of the branch using steam and diesel locomotives, previously running between Rockingham station (at the back of the Elsecar Heritage Centre) and Hemingfield Basin. The railway was operated using a variety of different preserved rolling stock.

The EHR had planned to eventually operate the line into Cortonwood, with a new halt at Hemingfield, doubling the length of the line to two miles.

==History==
The line was built to serve Earl Fitzwilliam&#x27;s collieries and ironworks, which he leased out to local ironmasters. It opened in 1850 as part of the South Yorkshire Railway, known as the Elsecar Branch. Following assorted mergers the line finally became part of the LNER upon formation of the Big Four.

The whole infrastructure was nationalised after the Second World War, with the mines becoming part of the National Coal Board in 1947 and the railway becoming part of British Railways in 1948.

The Elsecar branch closed in 1984 following closure of the final colliery on the line.

Restoration began in 1994 as a project of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and the line reopened as a heritage railway in 1996, operated by the Council. The Elsecar Heritage Railway became the operator in 2006.

==Closure==

Elsecar Heritage Railway was mothballed indefinitely when its operators surrendered their lease in November 2020, it was reported at the time that a commitment was made by Barnsley Council to reopen the site. 

In November 2023 Barnsley Council and Historic England announced plans to re-open the site with a track engineering college with places for 400 students each year and employment for 40 staff. The £25 million plan has been allocated some funding from the Cultural Development Fund though the plans are not expected to happen straight away. Other ideas for developing the site include a restaurant, a cycle hire centre, an outdoor performance area, and public spaces.

== Motive power ==
=== Steam locomotives ===
The railway&#x27;s collection of steam locomotives are used regularly for passenger services.

* Sentinel No. 6807 &quot;Gervase&quot;. (Running number 10) (Operational, returned to steam in 2013).
* Sentinel No. 9376 (unnamed). (Running number 7) (Scrapped).
* Sentinel No. 9599 &quot;William&quot;. (Operational, returned to steam in 2017).
* Peckett OQ Class No. 2150 &quot;Mardy Monster&quot;. (Undergoing overhaul).
* Avonside No. 1917 &quot;Earl Fitzwilliam&quot;, formerly &quot;Pitsford&quot;. (Stored).
* Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns No. 7386 &quot;Birkenhead&quot;. (Undergoing overhaul).

=== Diesel locomotives ===
The railway&#x27;s diesel locomotives are used to operate both passenger and engineering trains.

* Hunslet Engine Co. No. 6950 &quot;Louise&quot;. (Operational.)
* Yorkshire Engine Company No. 2895 &quot;Earl of Strafford&quot;. (Operational.)
* Sentinel &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. (Operational.)

===Other motive power===

* Wickham trolley track inspection vehicle. (In storage, awaiting restoration.)

== Coaching stock ==
Coaching stock is painted in British Railways &#x27;lined maroon&#x27; livery.
* BR Mk 1 TSO No. 3958. (In service.)
* BR Mk 1 TSO No. 4903. (In service.)
* BR Mk 1 BSK No. 35305. (In service.)
* BR Mk 1 SK No. 25562. (In service.)

== Stations ==

* Rockingham – Terminus and headquarters, serving the Elsecar Heritage Centre.
* Hemingfield – current temporary terminus, with groundworks complete for proposed new intermediate station.
* Cortonwood – planned new terminus station on the railway&#x27;s Cortonwood extension.

==Cortonwood extension==
The railway&#x27;s extension, currently under construction, involves the reinstatement of two level crossings, Tingle Bridge Lane and Smithy Lane. The latter, being a quiet road, will be protected by manually-operated crossing gates of traditional design. Tingle Bridge Lane is a busier road, and the railway is constructing a semi-automated crossing barrier system, with barriers manually lowered from a signal box, but automatically raised by track circuitry. On 16 May 2011 the permanent way materials for the level crossing arrived and a donation scheme was set up to raise the remainder of the money needed. Funds raised through this scheme have since been used to purchase barriers and traffic signals for the crossing ready for building. In August 2012 trial holes were dug to locate services under the road surface ready for construction of the crossing to take place.

On 21 June 2012 the ground was cleared and levelled for ballast and track alterations in anticipation of constructing the station at Hemingfield, currently the end of the line.

On 19 April 2013 the EHR built the level crossing on Tingle Bridge Lane, financed by a Director&#x27;s loan, and began extending the line into Cortonwood Colliery, as the next step of the Project.

By June 2014 the whole track had been laid up to Cortonwood, with minor levelling and ballasting remaining to become operational. The railway is now engaged in refinements to the permanent way, together with the necessary regulatory processes (with the local authority and the Office of Rail and Road) to see the extension opened for public services.

==Cortonwood memorial==
In November 2013 the EHR received a lottery grant of £50,000 to finance the provision of a Coal Mining Memorial Park at Cortonwood Colliery, a nationally important site, where the 1984/5 Miners Strike began. The project was completed in November 2014.

== Early life ==
Ahmir Thompson was born on January 20, 1971, into a musical family in Philadelphia. His father was Arthur Lee Andrews Thompson, from Goldsboro, North Carolina. A singer, he became known as Lee Andrews and was lead with Lee Andrews &amp; the Hearts, a 1950s doo-wop group. Ahmir&#x27;s mother, Jacquelin Thompson, together with his father, was also part of the Philadelphia-based soul group Congress Alley. His parents did not want to leave him with babysitters so they took him with them when they were on tour. He grew up in backstages of doo-wop shows. When he was 7 years old, Questlove helped prepare his father’s performance outfits and when he was 10, he operated stage lights for his father’s performances. At age 12, Questlove filled in as a drummer for his father’s band, debuting as a performer at the Radio City Music Hall.

Questlove&#x27;s parents enrolled him at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. By the time he graduated, he had founded a band called the Square Roots (later dropping the word &quot;square&quot;) with his friend Tariq Trotter (Black Thought). Questlove&#x27;s classmates at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts included Boyz II Men, jazz bassist Christian McBride, jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco, and singer Amel Larrieux. He attended senior prom with Larrieux. After graduating from high school, he took jazz and composition classes at the Settlement Music School.

Thompson began performing on South Street in Philadelphia using drums, while Tariq rhymed over his beats and rhythms. Thompson and Jay Lonick, a childhood friend, were known for improvisational &quot;call and response&quot; percussion battles with plastic buckets, crates, and shopping carts. This style translated into Thompson&#x27;s usual drumset arrangement, with most drums and cymbals positioned at waist level, emulating his original street setups.

For the Okayplayer platform and web television OkayAfrica TV, Questlove had his DNA tested in 2011 and genealogists researched his family ancestry. Questlove&#x27;s DNA revealed from both of his biological parents that he is of West African descent, specifically the Mende people (found mostly in Sierra Leone as well as Guinea and Liberia).

From the PBS television series, &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, hosted by Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Questlove learned in December 2017 that he was descended in part from Charles and Maggie Lewis, his three times great-grandparents, who had been taken captive in warfare and sold as slaves in the port of Ouidah, Dahomey (now Benin) to American ship captain William Foster. They were among 110 slaves smuggled illegally to Mobile, Alabama, in July 1860 on the &quot;Clotilda&quot;. It was the last known slave ship to carry slaves to the United States. Questlove is the only guest to have appeared on Gates&#x27;s program to be descended from slaves known by name, ship, and where they came from in Africa.

== Career ==
=== 1993–1996: Beginnings with the Roots ===
The Roots&#x27; lineup was soon completed, with Questlove on drums and percussion, Tariq Trotter and Malik B on vocals, Josh Abrams (Rubber Band) on bass (who was replaced by Leonard Hubbard in 1994), and Scott Storch on keyboards. While the group was performing a show in Germany, they recorded an album entitled &quot;Organix&quot;, released by Relativity Records in 1993.

Thompson was credited as &quot;B.R.O. the R.? (Beat Recycler of the Rhythm)&quot; on &quot;Organix&quot;, a name he disliked. Inspired after hearing the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest in 1990, he chose &quot;Questlove&quot; as his new moniker.

The group continued recording, releasing two critically acclaimed records in 1994 and 1996, &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot; and &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;, respectively.

=== 1997–2003: Breakthrough, Soulquarians era, and increased output ===

In 1999, the Roots had mainstream success with &quot;You Got Me&quot; (featuring Erykah Badu); the song earned the band the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for 2000. The song helped fuel the success of their &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; album, which has since been hailed as a classic, eventually selling platinum.

Questlove served as executive producer for Mos Def’s 1999 album Black on Both Sides, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Voodoo&quot;, Slum Village&#x27;s album &quot;Fantastic, Vol. 2&quot;, and Common&#x27;s albums &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; and &quot;Electric Circus&quot;. Besides the aforementioned albums, he has also contributed as a drummer or producer to Erykah Badu&#x27;s &quot;Baduizm&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot;, Dilated Peoples&#x27; &quot;Expansion Team&quot;, Blackalicious&#x27;s &quot;Blazing Arrow&quot;, Bilal&#x27;s &quot;1st Born Second&quot;, N*E*R*D&#x27;s &quot;Fly or Die&quot;, Joshua Redman&#x27;s &quot;Momentum&quot;, and Zap Mama&#x27;s Axel Norman &quot;Ancestry In Progress&quot;, Fiona Apple&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot;, and Zack De La Rocha&#x27;s currently unreleased solo material.

In 2001, he collaborated as the drummer for &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot;, a collaborative instrumental jazz album featuring Christian McBride and Uri Caine, and the DJ of the compilation &quot;Questlove Presents: Babies Making Babies&quot;, released on Urban Theory Records in 2002. He played drums on Christina Aguilera&#x27;s song &quot;Loving Me 4 Me&quot; for her 2002 album &quot;Stripped&quot;. In 2002, he and the Roots released the critically acclaimed &quot;Phrenology&quot;, which went gold.

In 2003, he played drums on John Mayer&#x27;s song &quot;Clarity&quot; from his second album &quot;Heavier Things&quot;. He also arranged and drummed on Joss Stone&#x27;s cover of the White Stripes&#x27; &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot;.

=== 2004–present: Continued output and other media endeavors ===

In 2004, the Roots released &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, which contained a more mainstream sound, allegedly due to demands from Interscope Records. The album sold 400,000 copies. In 2004, Questlove appeared in Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. In addition to appearing in the documentary portion of the film, Questlove was the drummer/musical director for all portions of the show with a live band.

In 2006, Questlove appeared in the film &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;, as well as a couple of skits on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. These included the Tupac &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; skit, and one featuring John Mayer, wherein Questlove performs in a barber shop, inducing the occupants to dance and rap. With the exception of the Fugees and Jill Scott, Questlove served as the drummer at the 2004 Brooklyn street concert and was the musical director for the entire show. Questlove was given an Esky for Best Scribe in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. In 2006, Questlove was one of a handful of musicians hand-picked by Steve Van Zandt to back Hank Williams Jr. on a new version of &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot; for the season premiere (and formal ESPN debut) of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Along with his fellow Motorola ROKR commercial co-stars, Bootsy Collins and Little Richard, Questlove&#x27;s bandmates included Rick Nielsen (Cheap Trick), Joe Perry (Aerosmith), Charlie Daniels, and Bernie Worrell. In the same year, he appeared in the studio album &quot;Fly&quot; of the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari.

In 2007, Questlove co-produced with VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Score&quot; winning producer Antonio &quot;DJ Satisfaction&quot; Gonzalez, from the Maniac Agenda, the theme to &quot;VH1&#x27;s Hip Hop Honors 2007&quot;.

On March 2, 2009, Questlove and the Roots began their run as house band for &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. He continues to perform with the Roots on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, continuing his duties from &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. He occasionally performed solos titled, &#x27;re-mixing the clips&#x27;, where he drew on his production and DJ abilities to dub video clips, cue audio samples in rhythm, and play drum breaks simultaneously.

In late 2009, while serving as an associate producer of the hit Broadway play &quot;Fela!&quot;, Questlove recruited Jay-Z to come on board as a producer. It was reported that Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith had also signed on as producers.

In January 2010, he was writing material with British singer Duffy for her second album. He has been featured in a commercial for Microsoft&#x27;s short-lived mobile phone, the Kin. In 2010, he made a cameo in the music video of Duck Sauce&#x27;s song &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot;, and with the Roots released the album &quot;Dilla Joints&quot; with renditions of producer J Dilla&#x27;s music. He contributed drums to the song &quot;You Got a Lot to Learn&quot;, which was recorded for the self-titled third studio album by Evanescence, but did not appear on the final release.

Questlove was planning to collaborate with Amy Winehouse before her death in July 2011. He said &quot;We&#x27;re Skype buddies, and she wants to do a project with Mos and me. Soon as she gets her visa thing together, that&#x27;s gonna happen.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Questlove number 2 in the 50 Top Tweeters in Music. In June 2011, Questlove played drums alongside the Roots bassist Owen Biddle for Karmin&#x27;s cover of Nicki Minaj&#x27;s &quot;Super Bass.&quot; Questlove placed 8th in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Readers Pick for Best Drummers of all Time.

During the interview, he also discussed his musical and cultural interests, how the Roots started a &quot;movement&quot; with three 15-passenger vans and the impact of the loss of musical icons in 2016.

<text>A Circle line party is a type of subway party occasionally held on the Circle line of the London Underground.

==Description==
Although the time and place of these parties is planned, the event itself occurs spontaneously, as each participant decides for themselves what sort of revelry, costume, decorations, snacks, libations and guests to bring to the party. The participants decorate the carriages festively, and play music, either live or on portable sound systems, disguised to appear as normal luggage. 

Other activities include setting up pole-dancing poles on the trains. Free drinks, snacks and sweets are provided, often being provided from well-stocked portable bars and snack tables, which disappear as the train arrives at the station. Commuters are invited to participate in the parties.

To maintain a low profile while the trains are in the stations, most participants only revel and frolic once the trains are in tunnels. Permission is not sought from London Underground or the British Transport Police for Circle line parties, and police sometimes stop trains for long periods to break the parties up. However, their organisers, typically linked to anarchist groups such as the Space Hijackers, claim that Circle line parties are not meant to disrupt travel, but to &quot;reclaim the public space from the advertisers and give it back to the people to whom it belongs&quot;.

===May 2008 party===
On 7 May 2008, the newly elected Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced that the drinking of alcohol would be banned on all public transport services run by Transport for London from 1 June. A man called Robbie Knox then thought up the idea of a Circle line party to be held at the end of the month to celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the London Underground, and spread the idea on the social networking website Facebook. The plan quickly received media attention and was mentioned in several newspapers.

On 31 May, the night itself, thousands of people attended, the largest Circle line party ever. Some dressed in costumes ranging from 1920s prohibition figures to Boris Johnson himself. The line was suspended after several trains were damaged during the party, and a number of London Underground staff and police officers were assaulted. Seventeen people were arrested due to disorderly behaviour and six tube stations were closed as they became overcrowded.

<text>This article contains a list of [[knot (mathematics)|mathematical knots]] and [[link (knot theory)|links]]. See also list of knots, list of geometric topology topics.

==Knots==
===Prime knots===

*41 knot/Figure-eight knot (mathematics) - a prime knot with a crossing number four
*51 knot/Cinquefoil knot, (5,2)-torus knot, Solomon&#x27;s seal knot, pentafoil knot - a prime knot with crossing number five which can be arranged as a {5/2} star polygon (pentagram)
*52 knot/Three-twist knot - the twist knot with three-half twists
*61 knot/Stevedore knot (mathematics) - a prime knot with crossing number six, it can also be described as a twist knot with four twists
*62 knot - a prime knot with crossing number six
*63 knot - a prime knot with crossing number six
*71 knot, septafoil knot, (7,2)-torus knot - a prime knot with crossing number seven, which can be arranged as a {7/2} star polygon (heptagram)
*74 knot, &quot;endless knot&quot;
*818 knot, &quot;carrick mat&quot;
*10161/10162, known as the Perko pair; this was a single knot listed twice in Dale Rolfsen&#x27;s knot table; the duplication was discovered by Kenneth Perko

*(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;)-torus knot - a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R3

===Composite===
*Square knot (mathematics) - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection
*Granny knot (mathematics) - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of two identical trefoil knots

==Links==
*0 link/Unlink - equivalent under ambient isotopy to finitely many disjoint circles in the plane
*2 link/Hopf link - the simplest nontrivial link with more than one component; it consists of two circles linked together exactly once (L2a1)
*4 link/Solomon&#x27;s knot (a two component &quot;link&quot; rather than a one component &quot;knot&quot;) - a traditional decorative motif used since ancient times (L4a1)
*5 link/Whitehead link - two projections of the unknot: one circular loop and one figure eight-shaped loop intertwined such that they are inseparable and neither loses its form (L5a1)
*Brunnian link - a nontrivial link that becomes trivial if any component is removed
*6 link/Borromean rings - three topological circles which are linked and form a Brunnian link (L6a4)
*L10a140 link - presumably the simplest non-Borromean Brunnian link
*Pretzel link - a Montesinos link with integer tangles

<text>Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (), commonly referred to as Ichilov Hospital () is the largest teaching hospital and general hospital serving Tel Aviv, Israel and its metropolitan area and is the second-largest hospital complex in the country. The complex is spread out over an area of 150,000 m2 and incorporates four hospitals: Ichilov General Hospital and Ida Sourasky Rehabilitation Center, Lis Maternity Hospital, and Dana Children&#x27;s Hospital. The director of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center is Prof. Ronni Gamzu.

==History==

The hospital was originally named after the Ichilov family. Ichilov Hospital was founded in 1963 as a one-building facility designed by architect Arieh Sharon. Renamed Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, it now encompasses three hospitals over an area of 150,000 square meters: Ichilov General Hospital and Ida Sourasky Rehabilitation Center, Lis Maternity Hospital, and Dana Children&#x27;s Hospital. The center also serves as an instructional and research center affiliated with Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and Sheinborn Nursing School.

The main building of Ichilov Hospital was built with the donations of Ted Arison and Shari Arison.

In 2011, a 700–1,000 bed bombproof emergency facility was opened. The building, with 13 stories above ground and four stories underground, provides protection against conventional, chemical and biological attack. Construction began in 2008. The cost of the building was $110 million, with a donation of $45 million from Israeli billionaire Sammy Ofer. The architect was Arad Sharon, grandson of Arieh Sharon who designed the original facility.

In 2022, the world&#x27;s largest emergency room was opened at Ichilov Hospital. The 8,000 square meter facility is equipped with facilities for self-triage and robots to guide people around.

<text>In the Estonian mythology and Kreutzwald&#x27;s epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;, Linda was the mother of Kalevipoeg and the wife of Kalev.

She has given the name to several Estonian locations, including the Lindamägi (Linda Hill), Tallinn, &quot;Lindakivi&quot; (Linda boulder) in Lake Ülemiste. According to the epic myth &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;, her son, the title character, named the Estonian fortress settlement at the location of modern Tallinn in her honor - &quot;Lindanise&quot; (approximate translation: Linda&#x27;s nipple or bosom).

<text>The State Bank of the USSR (), known as the State Bank of the RSFSR from 1921 to 1923, and commonly referred to as Gosbank (), was the central bank and main component of the single-tier banking system of the Soviet Union. It replaced the State Bank of the Russian Empire, and following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was absorbed by the Central Bank of Russia in 1992.

Gosbank was one of the three main Soviet economic authorities, the other two being Gosplan (the State Planning Committee) and Gossnab (the State Committee for Material Technical Supply). It closely collaborated with the Soviet Ministry of Finance to prepare the national state budget.

==History==

The foundation of the bank was part of the implementation of the New Economic Policy (NEP), following the monetary dislocation and barter economy during the Russian Civil War. On , the All-Russian Central Executive Committee passed a resolution for the founding of the State Bank of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, followed by a similar resolution passed by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars on and a statute passed by the Central Committee on which stipulated that the State Bank was part of the Ministry of Finance (Narkomfin). It began operations on 16 November 1921. In February 1922, Vladimir Lenin derided the State Bank as &quot;a bureaucratic paper game&quot;, comparing it to a Potemkin village in a letter to the bank’s head Aron Sheinman whom he accused of &quot;Communist-mandarin childishness&quot;. 

The State Bank presided over the two successive devaluations of the ruble, in 1922 (1 for 10,000) and 1923 (1 for 100). Meanwhile, on it was granted the right to issue the gold-backed chervonets or gold ruble that brought an end to the early Soviet hyperinflation. In 1923, it took its permanent name as State Bank of the USSR. In 1924 the State Bank produced its first consolidated credit plan, and formed the Committee on Banks to oversee the sectoral banks that had been created under the NEP. In 1925, it took over the previously separate cash holding system of Narkomfin.

The subsequent phase of Soviet central planning and phasing-out of the NEP led to the State Bank being granted a monopoly over short-term bank credit in 1927, and over all short-term credit in 1930 after mutual and direct commercial credit was terminated. In 1928-1930, the local branches of other banks were brought under the State Bank or closed, so that Prombank, Tsekombank or Selkhozbank subsequently operated largely through the State Bank&#x27;s local offices. That phase of reform was completed in 1932, after which the division of labor between the State Bank and the other components of the Soviet banking system remained broadly stable until the late 1980s.

In 1931 Boris Berlatsky, a senior official of the State Bank was put on trial for wrecking as part of the 1931 Menshevik Trial.
Following aggressive monetary expansion during World War II, the monetary reform of 1947 resulted in another round of devaluation (1 for 10) and related confiscatory measures. In 1959, the consolidation of the specialized long-term credit banks into the Construction Bank of the USSR resulted in the assumption of some former operations of Selkhozbank, Tsekombank and municipal banks by the State Bank. The monetary reform of 1961 introduced another round of devaluation (1 for 10). In 1963, the State Bank&#x27;s control over the system was further strengthened as it took over the State Labor Savings Banks System from the Soviet Ministry of Finance.

The Soviet state used the State Bank primarily as a tool to impose centralized control upon industry in general, using bank balances and transaction histories to monitor the activity of individual concerns and their compliance with five-year plans and directives. The State Bank never acted as a commercial bank aiming at profit maximization, but purely as an instrument of government policy. Instead of independently and impartially assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, Gosbank would provide loan funds to individuals, groups and industries as directed by the central government.

In the 1970s, the State Bank was involved in the creation of Ost-West Handelsbank in Frankfurt (1971), Donau Bank in Vienna (1974), and East-West United Bank in Luxembourg (1974) together with the Foreign Trade Bank of the USSR.

The Law on the State Enterprise, introduced in June 1987, represented a significant attempt to impose financial accountability and autonomy on state enterprises. Bank reforming officially began on 1 January 1988 when Gosbank was dismantled to create a two-tier banking system. Mikhail Gorbachev divided Gosbank into a central bank and state-owned specialized banks (spetsbanks). These included Agroprombank and Zhilsotsbank, while Stroybank became Promstroybank. The government continued to direct credit policy, but Gosbank was now able to set interest rates on credit in coordination with Gosplan and the Ministry of Finance.

In March 1989, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a resolution making the spetsbanks responsible for their own financing of operations, known as &quot;khozraschet&quot;, as policymakers had thought that this would give the spetsbanks a profit motive; however, this only increased tensions between the spetsbanks and Gosbank as the latter retained control over credit resources. Following the appointment of Viktor Gerashchenko as the director of Gosbank, it played a key role in the creation of a parallel banking system as Gerashchenko viewed the early spetsbank reforms as insufficient.

In September 1990, the Soviet government permitted the specialized banks that had emerged from Gosbank to &quot;commercialize&quot; themselves, which quickly led to the splintering of the centralized system. As both the governments of the Soviet Union and Russian SFSR had not created the institutional groundwork for this process, this led to the emergence of hundreds of small banks and a few large centralized banking systems.

===Demise===
Following the election of Boris Yeltsin as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the elections of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Russia in March 1990, the Russian republic sought to distance itself from the central government and on 12 June, it declared state sovereignty. In July, the government of the Russian SFSR formed the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) from the Russian republic&#x27;s branch of Gosbank. The government had sought to create a counterweight to Gosbank during the struggle for state sovereignty. In October, it created Vneshtorgbank Russia as its own foreign trade bank. In December, the Law on the Central Bank and the Law on Banks and Banking Activity was passed in the Russian republic, which formalized the CBR&#x27;s independence.

In December 1990, Soviet prime minister Valentin Pavlov and Gosbank director Viktor Gerashchenko responded to the Russian SFSR&#x27;s passage of sovereign banking laws by validating all 50 and 100 ruble notes in circulation from the following month. As the Bank of Russia was not informed, the public&#x27;s trust in Gosbank was greatly damaged. The Soviet republics stopped paying most taxes to the central government, and in March 1991, Gosbank estimated that only seven billion rubles of expected tax revenue had been remitted by the republics, out of a total of 23.4 billion rubles. Deputy Premier Grigory Yavlinsky advocated for the creation of a &quot;banking union&quot;, namely a formal monetary union among the Soviet republics, in the New Union Treaty, but that attempt rapidly foundered in the second half of 1991. 

Gosbank and the CBR continued to operate in parallel until the August Coup. On 23 August, Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to finish the transfer of Union-level organizations within the Russian SFSR to the government of the Russian SFSR by the end of the year. Andrei Zverev was appointed by the government of the Russian SFSR as the temporary director of Gosbank, although Gerashchenko did not submit his resignation until 26 December. On 15 November, Yeltsin took over the Ministry of Finance of the USSR and Goznak. After the signing of the Belovezh Accords, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russia passed a resolution transferring Gosbank&#x27;s &quot;facilities, documents, and specialists&quot; to the Bank of Russia, and on 1 January 1992, it took over the rest of Gosbank&#x27;s resources in Russia, after which Gosbank officially ceased to exist.

<text>Breath of Fire II is a role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom. First released in 1994, the game was licensed to Laguna for European release in 1996. It is the second entry in the &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; series. It was later ported to Game Boy Advance and re-released worldwide. The game was released on Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in North America on August 27, 2007. Nintendo of Europe&#x27;s website mistakenly announced it for release on July 27, 2007, but it was in fact released two weeks later, on August 10, 2007. In 2013, it was released for the Wii U Virtual Console. In 2016, it was released for the New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console. In 2019, it was released for the Nintendo Switch SNES games library.

Unlike later installments in the series, &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;. Set 500 years after the original game, the story centers on an orphan named Ryu Bateson, whose family vanished mysteriously long ago. After his friend is falsely accused of a crime, Ryu embarks on a journey to clear his name.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; is a traditional role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments. Players view the game from a top-down perspective and move their characters in four directions across various environments including towns and dungeons while interacting with non-player characters and battling enemies to advance the story. 

The game features a redesigned, text-based game menu as opposed to the icon-based design of the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, as well as a new &quot;Monster Meter&quot; that indicates the probability of encountering enemy monsters in a given area. Players are required to venture into dangerous areas throughout the game world as dictated by the story, and randomly encounter enemies every few steps which must be defeated to advance. As the game progresses, new characters, each with their own specific abilities, join the player&#x27;s party. Like the previous game, only four characters may be in a party at a given time, but now may not be freely switched outside of certain areas. Each character has a unique Personal Action that may be performed outside of combat that allows the player to access certain areas, destroy objects, avoid traps, or move about the game more easily. &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; includes a new town-building feature that allows the player to populate their own village with special characters found throughout the game. Each character has their own distinct job, and may be invited to live in houses that the player adds by donating currency to one of three carpenters, each with their own building style. Six special inhabitants known as Shamans may also join the town, each with their own elemental alignment, and up to two at a time may be fused with party members to grant them new forms and abilities. While joined with a shaman, characters become stronger and may gain access to additional abilities while in battle.

Combat in &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; is presented using a turn-based approach, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round with the actions taking place by order of each character&#x27;s and enemy&#x27;s &quot;agility&quot; rating. A new Formation feature allows the player to organize their party into different positions, allowing certain members an increase in speed, defense, or attack power. Players win battles by defeating every enemy present, dealing damage by using normal attacks along with magic spells and items. When all enemies are defeated, they yield experience points that go toward leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells. Each character&#x27;s health is represented by numerical hit points that indicate their remaining vitality, and are knocked out if the value reaches zero, with the battle ending if each member of a player&#x27;s party is knocked out. Progress is recorded using the game cartridge&#x27;s internal battery back-up memory, which can be accessed at dragon statues throughout gameplay.

==Plot==

===Characters===
The characters of &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; were designed by Capcom artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who also provided artwork for the cast of the previous game. &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; features nine playable characters who join the player&#x27;s party at set points throughout the story, each with their own selection of attacks, magic spells, and personal actions which can be used to pass certain obstacles and solve puzzles. 

The main protagonist is a 16-year-old boy named Ryu Bateson, who shares his name with the main character from the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, who mysteriously finds himself alone in the world one day after his father and sister disappear and all townspeople in his village forget who he is. As a member of the elusive Dragon Clan, Ryu possess the ability to transform into powerful draconic beings with destructive abilities, and makes his way as a &quot;Ranger&quot;, a sword-for-hire. He is joined by his friend and fellow Ranger, Bow (&quot;Boche Doggy&quot; in the Japanese version), a thief and member of the Grassrunner clan of dog-people who uses a crossbow and healing spells. Throughout the game, players recruit additional characters at different points in the story, including Katt (&quot;Rinpu Chuan&quot; in the Japanese version), a member of the Woren clan of cat-people who fights at a coliseum; Rand Marks, muscular pangolin-person who fights with his bare hands; Nina Windia, descendant of the original Nina from &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; and princess of a clan of winged humans who was exiled due to her black wings, a bad omen in her country; Sten Legacy, a former soldier from a kingdom of monkey-people who makes his way as a trickster and performer; Ekkal Hoppa de Pe Jean, or simply Jean (&quot;Tapeta&quot; in the Japanese version), a love-struck prince of a race of frog-people who struggles to regain his kingdom after his throne is usurped; and Spar (&quot;Aspara Gus&quot; in the Japanese version), an emotionless plant girl who can commune with nature and is held captive by a traveling sideshow. An optional character in the form of the immortal sorceress Bleu (&quot;Deis&quot; in the Japanese version) from the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; may also be recruited.

===Story===
&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; is set in a fantasy world 500 years after the events of the original game. The story opens on Ryu, age 6, living in the village of Gate with his sister Yua and father Ganer, a priest for the Church of St. Eva. Years earlier, Ryu&#x27;s mother disappeared when demons erupted from a hole in a mountain on the outskirts of town, which was eventually blocked by a large dragon. One day, after visiting the dragon near the mountainside, Ryu returns to find his family missing and that no one in the village remembers who he is. Believing him to be an orphan, the townsfolk send him to live at the church with Father Hulk, who has seemingly been acting pastor for years. There, Ryu meets Bow, a fellow orphan, and runs away with him during a storm. The two seek shelter in a cave, where they encounter the demon Barubary, who claims that Ryu is the &quot;Destined Child&quot;, knocks them unconscious, and disappears.

Ten years later, Ryu and Bow live together in HomeTown as members of a Rangers guild, and are tasked with finding the lost pet of Mina, princess of the Kingdom of Windia. The two reluctantly complete the task and upon their return, Bow is charged with stealing from Trout, a local rich man. Bow claims he was framed by a mysterious &quot;winged thief&quot;. Both escape the town the following night, and Bow remains in hiding while Ryu leaves to find the real thief and clear his friend&#x27;s name. To gather information, Ryu travels to Coursair, a town with a large coliseum, and becomes a challenger in the arena against Katt, the coliseum&#x27;s most popular fighter. Ryu gains Katt&#x27;s trust by foiling the coliseum manager&#x27;s plot to poison her and stage the fight, and then allies with her and Rand, an employee at the Coliseum, to defeat the manager, who has been possessed by a demon. While Rand stays behind to help construct Bow&#x27;s hideout, Ryu and Katt arrive at HomeTown to investigate. There, they meet Nina, a student of magic and Mina&#x27;s older sister. When Mina is kidnapped by a gang in an effort to blackmail Nina, she joins Ryu and Katt to defeat the gang&#x27;s leader, who is also a demon in disguise. The party returns Mina to Windia, but find themselves expelled from the castle due to the superstition surrounding Nina&#x27;s black wings. They are joined by Sten, a trickster who fails to swindle them and pledges himself to their cause. In the port town of Capitan, the party encounters Ray, a wandering priest of St. Eva, and assist him in rescuing a number of villagers from Capitan&#x27;s dry well. Afterwards, Bow&#x27;s hideaway is rebuilt into TownShip, and Ryu meets a Shaman, who taps into his latent ability to transform into a dragon, revealing him to be a part of the Dragon Clan thought missing for hundreds of years.

Upon traveling to a new continent, the group meets Jean, a frog-prince whose castle of SimaFort has been usurped by an impostor, whom the party is able to expose as a demon and defeat. The party retrieves the real thief, a bat-winged girl named Patty, from SimaFort&#x27;s dungeon and turn her over to Trout. Exonerated, Bow rejoins the party, but expresses suspicion over Trout. He and Ryu break into Trout&#x27;s house at night and find Patty imprisoned in a secret dungeon, and defeat Trout, also possessed by a demon. Suspecting the demon outbreak to be part of a larger problem, the party searches the world for Spar, a Grassman able to communicate with plants. Upon rescuing Spar from the clutches of a traveling sideshow, the party consults with the Great Wise Tree Gandaroof and discover that he is losing his memory. He requests that the party acquire the Therapy Pillow from the city of Tunlan so that they can enter his mind to restore it. To communicate with the people of Tunlan, the party first retrieves the Famous Flute from Sten&#x27;s hometown of HighFort, where Sten is forced to confront his past as a former soldier and help rescue the kingdom from Shupkay, another demon in disguise. After saving Tunlan&#x27;s princess from demonic possession, the party uses the Therapy Pillow to visit Gandaroof&#x27;s mind, which is being destroyed by the demon Aruhameru. Aruhameru claims that Gandaroof possesses knowledge that threatens his &quot;God&quot;, and reveals that he destroyed the people of Gate&#x27;s memory of Ryu.

Once the party vanquishes Aruhameru, they learn that the demon outbreak is linked to Gate and the Church of St. Eva. When Rand&#x27;s mother Daisy is abducted by St. Eva&#x27;s soldiers, Nina decides to return to Windia and obtain the &quot;mark of the wing&quot;, an old relic that will allow her to transform into the Great Bird and fly the group to St. Eva&#x27;s Grand Church. After reuniting with her parents and consorting with the spirit of her great-great-great-great grandmother, the original Nina from &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, Nina obtains the mark and prepares to undergo a ceremony that will transform her into the Great Bird permanently. However, Mina steals the mark and takes her sister&#x27;s place, sacrificing her humanity. Traveling on Mina, the party makes their way to Evrai, the home of St. Eva. They find themselves trapped within the city, but manage to escape with the help of Claris, a young woman allied with a group of rebels seeking to destroy St. Eva.

Seeking out the rebels, the party meets their leader Tiga, and reunite with Patty, now the rebels&#x27; benefactor. Together, the rebels and the party discover that St. Eva is a front for a demon who uses the prayers of worshippers to empower itself, and Tiga formulates a plan to infiltrate the Grand Church. The plan succeeds, and the party learns that Habaruku, St. Eva&#x27;s high priest, has captured Claris. Tiga attempts to rescue her, only for both him and Claris to be killed. The party pursues Habaruku, but Ray blocks their path and attacks them in dragon form, revealing himself as a member of the Dragon Clan. The battle awakens a powerful new dragon form in Ryu, which he uses to vanquish Ray. The party then rescues Daisy, who sacrifices herself to save Rand from a trap so that her son can continue fighting. In the catacombs of the church, the party finds Ryu&#x27;s father Ganer attached to an energy-draining machine, having been kidnapped by Aruhameru ten years ago. Ryu and his friends either kill or rescue him, demolishing the church in doing so, and make their way back to Gate to stop the demons&#x27; plot once and for all. In Gate, the party watches as Father Hulk and the townsfolk try to destroy the dragon with a bomb, believing it to be responsible for the death of Gate&#x27;s forest. The bomb weakens the dragon, allowing demons to escape from the mountain. Remorseful, Hulk asks the party to bring Patty, who has knowledge of the dragon. Upon Patty&#x27;s arrival, Father Hulk captures her and reveals himself to be Habaruku in disguise, declaring his plan to sacrifice Patty, a member of the Dragon clan (and Ryu&#x27;s sister Yua), to open the gate and release his God. With help from the dragon, the party defeats Habaruku.

The dragon thanks the party and reveals herself to be Ryu&#x27;s mother Valerie, a member of the Dragon Clan that traveled from their underground hiding place and married Ryu&#x27;s father, later assuming the form of a dragon to save her family from the invading demons. Valerie gives the party the choice of allowing her to resume her duty of guarding the gate, or traveling to defeat the demons for good; she sacrifices herself to open the gate if they agree. The party travels deep underground to the demon stronghold, where they meet the last remaining members of the Dragon Clan. Ryu gains the ultimate dragon power of Anfini and battles Barubary, the demon from his past. Once Barubary is defeated, the party confronts his master, Deathevn, St. Eva&#x27;s God and a remnant of Myria, the main antagonist of the previous game. Using Anfini, Ryu defeats Deathevn, and returns home with his friends, although he realizes that Deathevn has not truly been defeated and will someday return. Two possible endings occur based on the player&#x27;s actions — either Ryu sacrifices himself like his mother by transforming into a dragon to prevent further demon encroachment, or, if the player saved Ganer and enabled TownShip to fly, Ganer pilots the town onto the mountain, sealing it for good.

A third ending also exists: If the player chooses not to enter the cave and confront Deathevn when prompted by Valerie, a non-standard game over will be triggered in which the demons ultimately break through the weakened seal and conquer the world.

==Development==
&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; was developed by many of the same Capcom employees who worked on the previous game, including producer Tokuro Fujiwara and lead designer Yoshinori Kawano. While the character designs for the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; were conceived by company head of development Keiji Inafune, the cast of &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; was created entirely by artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who had previously only provided promotional art for the game&#x27;s predecessor. Unlike the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, which was licensed to Square Soft for its North American release, the English version of &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; was localized and published entirely by Capcom USA. The game was released in North America one year after the Japanese version in December 1995, and would later become the first &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; title to become available in Europe in April 1996.

Three days before the release of the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; on Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance in July 2001, Capcom announced that they would similarly port &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; to the handheld, with an initial release date some time in 2002. Like the re-release of its predecessor, the handheld version features re-drawn character portraits in menu screens, new still images used in cutscenes throughout the game, and a re-designed battle interface similar to &quot;Breath of Fire IV&quot;. New features include a dash button that allows players to move through the game faster, as well as an item-sharing system where two players may link together using the Game Boy Advance link cable to exchange items between game cartridges. To celebrate the game&#x27;s release in December 2001, Capcom of Japan held an art contest for fans to submit artwork featuring characters from the first two &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; games, with the winner chosen by the Game Boy Advance version&#x27;s staff. In January 2002, Capcom USA announced that an English version of &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; would be heading to North America the following April. A European version would also be released in July 2002, published by Ubisoft.

===Audio===
While the background music for the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; was composed by four members of Capcom&#x27;s sound team Alph Lyla, the score for &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; was written entirely by series newcomer Yuko Takehara. In January 1995, the &quot;Breath of Fire II: Shimei no Ko Original Soundtrack&quot; was released in Japan by Sony Records, and featured 28 selected themes from the game on a single disc. A complete musical selection from the title would not be made commercially available until 2006, with the release of the &quot;Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box&quot;, which contained all music from the first five games of the series. In order to promote the game, Capcom hired J-pop singer Mio Watanabe to record a theme song that played during the game&#x27;s television commercial in Japan called &quot;Owaranai Ai&quot; (終わらない愛, &quot;lit. Unending Love&quot;), which was released as a single in December 1994 by Alfa Records.

==Reception==
&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; was released the same week as Sony&#x27;s PlayStation console in Japan, and debuted on Japanese software charts as the seventh highest-selling game of its first week with 89,700 copies. It was given an 8 out of 10 in two separate Reader Cross Reviews printed by &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;, and it would go on to sell a total of 350,000 copies in the region by the end of 1995. The game became popular enough to be re-released in the region for the Nintendo Power flash RAM peripheral in September 1997 at a reduced price.

Reviews in North America were mixed to positive. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; generally found the game worth getting for its high quality sound and lengthy quest. Though Mark Lefebvre felt the graphics were below average and that the game overall &quot;could have been a little better&quot;, the other three reviewers were more enthusiastic, praising the graphics and the shaman mechanic. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Major Mike was also impressed with the sheer length of the RPG. While remarking that there are very few cinematic scenes compared to the first &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, he was pleased with the complexity of both the main story and most of the side quests. He also complimented the graphics and the change to different musical themes halfway through the game, and summarized, &quot;This long, absorbing game offers plenty of story turns, intense battles, and intriguing characters.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the game &quot;is larger and more involved than its predecessor, but unfortunately also much less interesting. While some parts are very clever (you are able to build your home town, populating it with stray homeless folks you run across), it suffers from too little direction, a purely mechanical storyline, and the clunkiest dialogue since &quot;Night Trap&quot;.&quot;

Similar to the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System release, the Game Boy Advance version met with mostly positive reception from critics, with the Japanese version receiving a 29 out of 40 score from &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; magazine. GameSpot compared the game to the previous version, calling it a &quot;faithful translation of the SNES game&quot; and praised the title&#x27;s new save feature allowing players to record their progress at any time, but found that its music &quot;leans toward the bland side of things&quot; and &quot;lack[s] personality&quot;. IGN found the game to be a step up from the first game&#x27;s Game Boy Advance port, stating that &quot;The storyline and characters make Breath of Fire II a much better game than the first adventure in the series...even though the game hasn&#x27;t changed a whole lot.&quot; The website additionally felt that the game&#x27;s lack of spaces in text fields and shoddy translation hurt the overall presentation, and the graphics were not up to par with games designed initially for the handheld such as Camelot&#x27;s &quot;Golden Sun&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; awarded the Game Boy version a perfect score as well as an Editor&#x27;s Choice Award, stating that the only flaw was the game&#x27;s low difficulty, declaring that &quot;In the realm of today’s high-powered next-gen role-players, BOFII is an excellent time-killer&quot;. The game would later be nominated for &quot;Best Port of a 16-bit Classic&quot; and &quot;Best Role-Playing Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; in GameSpot&#x27;s Best and Worst of 2002 Awards. The Game Boy Advance version holds a 75% review average on GameRankings, as well as an 81% average on Metacritic.

&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot;″s Virtual Console release in 2007 met with mixed response. GameSpot called attention to the title&#x27;s &quot;pleasing visual presentation&quot; and breadth of content, but found the game&#x27;s localization to be &quot;terrible&quot; along with unpolished gameplay mechanics that made it appear to be a &quot;hasty, careless effort&quot;. The game&#x27;s pacing was also said to be poor, with too many &quot;mundane tasks&quot; laden throughout the story, recommending it to players who could look past its &quot;rough edges&quot;. IGN called the game&#x27;s translation &quot;average at best&quot; with the lack of adequate spacing in text fields still present, yet ultimately calling it a &quot;solid, enjoyable RPG experience...though not a role-playing masterpiece on the level of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; or &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;&quot;. Eurogamer called attention to the game&#x27;s high rate of random battles, but nonetheless called the game &quot;a beautifully crafted and impeccably produced adventure&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked the game 171st in its list of the top 200 games released across all Nintendo consoles, ten places behind the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;. In 2018, Complex listed the game 75th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; writing: &quot;Breath of Fire II isn’t too different from the original, but different enough to not be a direct clone. It’s a fun, turn-based RPG. But it’s not as good as the first one.&quot; IGN rated the game 53rd in its Top 100 SNES Games. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) or verified paper record (VPR) is a method of providing feedback to voters who use an electronic voting system. A VVPAT allows voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results. It contains the name and party affiliation of candidates for whom the vote has been cast. While VVPAT has gained in use in the United States compared with ballotless voting systems without it, hand-marked ballots are used by a greater proportion of jurisdictions.

As a paper-based medium, the VVPAT offers some fundamental advantages over an electronic-only recording medium when storing votes. A paper VVPAT is readable by the human eye and voters can directly interpret their vote. Computer memory requires a device and software which is potentially proprietary. Insecure voting machine records could potentially be changed quickly without detection by the voting machine itself. Auditable paper ballots make it more difficult for voting machines to corrupt records without human intervention. Corrupt or malfunctioning voting machines might store votes other than as intended by the voter unnoticed. A VVPAT allows voters to verify their votes are cast as intended, an additional barrier to changing or destroying votes.

The VVPAT includes a direct recording electronic voting system (DRE), to assure voters that their votes have been recorded as intended and as a means to detect fraud and equipment malfunction. Depending on election laws, the paper audit trail may constitute a legal ballot and therefore provide a means by which a manual vote count can be conducted if a recount is necessary. 

In non-document ballot voting systems – both mechanical voting machines and DRE voting machines – the voter does not have an option to review a tangible ballot to confirm the voting system accurately recorded his or her intent. In addition, an election official is unable to manually recount ballots in the event of a dispute. Because of this, critics claim there is an increased chance for electoral fraud or malfunction and security experts, such as Bruce Schneier, have demanded voter-verifiable paper audit trails. Non-document ballot voting systems allow only a recount of the &quot;stored votes&quot;. These &quot;stored votes&quot; might not represent the correct voter intent if the machine has been corrupted or suffered malfunction.

As of 2024, VVPAT systems are used in countries including the United States, India, Venezuela, the Philippines, and Bulgaria. In the U.S., 98.5 percent of registered voters live in jurisdictions offering some form of paper ballot, whether hand-marked or VVPAT. Only 1.4 percent use electronic systems with no paper record. 

==History==

In 1897, responding to a question from Rhode Island Governor Charles W. Lippitt about the legality of using the newly-developed McTammany direct-recording voting machine, Associate Justice Horatio Rogers of the Rhode Island Supreme Court noted that a voter casting a vote on such a machine without a written record &quot;has no knowledge through his senses that he has accomplished a result. The most that can be said, is, &quot;if&quot; the machine worked as intended, then he ... has voted.&quot; This observation remains at the center of concerns with ballotless DRE voting machines today.

In 1899, Joseph Gray addressed this problem with a mechanical voting machine that simultaneously recorded votes in its mechanism and punched those votes on a paper ballot that the voter could inspect before dropping it in a ballot box. Gray explained that &quot;in this manner, we have a mechanical check for the tickets [ballots], while the ticket is also a check upon the register [mechanical vote counter].&quot; This check is only effective if there is an audit to compare the paper and mechanical records.

The idea of creating a parallel paper trail for a direct-recording voting mechanism remained dormant for a century until it was rediscovered by Rebecca Mercuri, who suggested essentially the same idea in 1992. The Mercuri method, as some have called it, was refined in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000; in her final version, the paper record is printed behind glass so that the voter may not take it or alter it.

The first commercial voting systems to incorporate voter verifiable paper audit trail printers were the Avante Vote Trakker and a retrofit to the Sequoia AVC Edge called the VeriVote Printer. Avante&#x27;s system saw its first trial use in 2002, and in 2003, the state of Nevada required the use of VVPAT technology statewide and adopted the Sequoia system. It is notable that, in Avante&#x27;s design, the shield preventing the voter from taking the paper record was an afterthought, while in Sequoia&#x27;s design, the paper record for successive voters were printed sequentially on a single roll of paper.

Voter-verifiable paper audit trail was first used in an election in India in September 2013 in Noksen (Assembly Constituency) in Nagaland. The VVPAT system was introduced in 8 of 543 parliamentary constituencies as a pilot project in the 2014 Indian general election. VVPAT was implemented in Lucknow, Gandhinagar, Bangalore South, Chennai Central, Jadavpur, Raipur, Patna Sahib and Mizoram constituencies. VVPAT along with EVMs was used on a large-scale for the first time in India, in 10 assembly seats out of 40 in 2013 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election. VVPAT -fitted EVMs was used in entire Goa state in the 2017 assembly elections, the first time that entire state in India saw the implementation of VVPAT. A VVPAT system was introduced in all 543 Lok sabha constituencies in the 2019 Indian general election.

== Case study: U.S. presidential election in Georgia 2020 ==
In July 2019, after legal challenges and concerns about the security and reliability of its aging electronic voting machines, Georgia officials approved a $107 million contract with Dominion Voting Systems to equip all 159 Georgia counties with new ballot-marking devices that provide a paper ballot for every vote cast (VVPAT). The upgrade was completed in time for the 2020 Georgia Republican and Democratic presidential primaries.

The system proved critical during the general election in November 2020. A razor-thin margin of victory for Joe Biden (0.23 percent or 11,779 votes)—the first by a Democratic presidential candidate in the state since 1992—automatically triggered a statewide audit, made possible by the new auditable paper ballot system. The audit found several human errors at the county level, netting Trump 1,274 votes. At the Trump campaign&#x27;s request, this was followed by a full statewide hand recount of the paper ballots, which confirmed the result. 

Starting in 2002 with the statewide adoption of DREs and as recently as the 2016 election, the lack of a system producing auditable paper ballots would have made a recount impossible. The VVPAT system allowed officials to cross-check electronic results with paper records, confirming the accuracy of the final vote count and refuting claims by President Trump in a January 2, 2021 phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that the count was inaccurate. 

In additional to providing transparency, Georgia&#x27;s new VVPAT system helped counter a strong disinformation campaign by facilitating a total of three cross-confirming counts—initial vote, audit, and hand recount. This increased voter confidence, providing a reliable method to verify the results during the intense scrutiny of the 2020 election. A survey by the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research conducted before and after the election found a smaller-than-expected drop in Georgia voters&#x27; confidence (from 90% in October 2020 to 85% in January 2021) that their votes would count as intended.
==Application==
Various technologies can be used to implement a paper audit trail.
* Attachment of a printer to direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines that print paper records stored within the machine. Such designs usually present the record to the voter behind a transparent surface to enable a voter to confirm a printed record matches the electronic ballot. The records can be manually counted and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute. The solution linking electronic ballot images and the voter-verified paper record with randomly generated unique voting session identifier is covered by patents issued and pending.
* Attachment of a printer to DRE voting machines that print paper records on special paper with security features. The printed page contains both a plain text record and a simple barcode of the voter&#x27;s selections. This page is the official ballot that is then fed through a scanner into a locked ballot box so that all originals are saved in case of the need for a recount or audit. The electronic record from the DRE is compared with the barcode scanner record and in case of any discrepancy, the paper ballots are used to determine the official vote, not the electronic record. The voter has the ability to proofread the ballot before it is placed into the scanner/lockbox and have it voided if there is any error, just as has always been possible with existing manual voting systems.
* Attachment of a printer to DRE voting machines that print an encrypted receipt that is either retained by the voter or stored within the machine. If the receipt is retained, the receipts can be manually counted and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute. These systems have not been used in elections in the United States.
* Creation of an encrypted audit trail at the same time the electronic ballot is created in a DRE voting machine, a form of witness system. The audit trail can be accessed and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute.
* Use of precinct-based optical scan or mark-sense tabulators instead of DREs. In this simple and cost-effective system, voters fill out paper ballots which are then counted electronically by a tabulator at the precinct, similar to the technology used to score standardized tests. Optical scan machines have been in use for decades, and provide a voter-verified audit trail by default. Tabulators can detect overvotes at the poll so that the voter can be given the opportunity to correct a spoiled ballot.

Systems that allow the voters to prove how they voted do not conform to the generally accepted definition of voting by secret ballot, as such proof raises the risk of voter intimidation and vote selling. As such, systems that allow such proof are generally forbidden under the terms of numerous international agreements and domestic laws.

Professor Avi Rubin has testified in front of the United States House Committee on House Administration in favor of voting systems that use a paper ballot and disfavoring systems that use retrofitted VVPAT attachments. He has said on his personal blog that &quot;after four years of studying the issue, I now believe that a DRE with a VVPAT is not a reasonable voting system.&quot;

An auditable system, such as that provided with VVPAT, can be used in randomized recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot can be treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count or, in some cases, if the VVPAT is damaged or otherwise unreadable. In any subsequent recounts or challenges the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns of any paper ballot system.

Matt Quinn, the developer of the original Australian DRE system, believes that &quot;There&#x27;s no reason voters should trust a system that doesn&#x27;t have [a voter-verified audit trail], and they shouldn&#x27;t be asked to. Why on earth should [voters] have to trust me – someone with a vested interest in the project&#x27;s success? A voter-verified audit trail is the only way to &#x27;prove&#x27; the system&#x27;s integrity to the vast majority of electors, who after all, own the democracy.&quot;

In India, in an instance VVPAT was helpful in resolving an issue pertaining to a tally of votes in Kancheepuram (State Assembly Constituency) in 2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election as the number of votes entered in the Form 17C of a polling booth and the total number of votes recorded in the EVM control unit of that booth did not tally. In June 2018, Election Commission of India introduced a built-in-hood on top of the contrast sensor and paper roll that does not soak humidity in all VVPATs to prevent it from excess light and heat. In case of a discrepancy between the information on VVPATs and the EVMs, the paper slips of the particular polling station in question are recounted. If the discrepancy persists, the count established by the VVPAT paper slips prevails over the vote count registered on the EVMs.

==Challenges and concerns==

===Common problems===
Common VVPAT problems are:
# Video of voter behavior during an actual election revealed that most voters do not verify their choices by reading the VVPAT.
# Research indicates voters who &quot;do&quot; check ballot summaries overlook discrepancies.
# A manual VVPAT recount/audit is labor-intensive and expensive, and likely unaffordable to most candidates seeking it.
# And while VVPAT is designed to serve as a check on DRE (Direct Recording Electronic) vote recorders, it relies on the same proprietary programming and electronics to produce the audit trail.

Other hurdles in the implementation of paper audit trails include the performance and authority of the audit. Paper audit systems increase the cost of electronic voting systems, can be difficult to implement, often require specialized external hardware, and can be difficult to use. In the United States twenty-seven states require a paper audit trail by statute or regulation for all direct recording electronic voting machines used in public elections.
Another eighteen States don&#x27;t require them, but use them either statewide or in local jurisdictions.

===Security ===
The introduction of malicious software into a VVPAT system can cause it to intentionally misrecord the voter&#x27;s selections. This attack could minimize detection by manipulating only a small percentage of the votes or for only lesser known races.

Another security concern is that a VVPAT could print while no voter is observing the paper trail, a form of ballot stuffing. Even if additional votes were discovered through matching to the voters list, it would be impossible to identify legitimate ballots from fraudulent ballots.

Alternatively the printer could invalidate the printed record after the voter leaves and print a new fraudulent ballot. These ballots would be undetectable as invalidated ballots are quite common during elections. Also, VVPAT systems that are technically able to reverse the paper feed could be open to manipulated software overwriting or altering the VVPAT after the voter checks it.

===Usability and ergonomics===
For the voter, the printed record is &quot;in a different format than the ballot, in a different place, is verified at a different time, and has a different graphical layout with different contrast and lighting parameters.&quot; In November 2003 in Wilton, CT, virtually all voters had to be prompted to find and verify their receipt, increasing the time required to vote and the work for the pollworkers. The VVPAT adds to the complexity of voting, already a deterrent to voting.

In addition, a VVPAT component may not be easily usable by poll-workers, many of whom are already struggling with DRE maintenance and use and new elections law requirements. In the 2006 primary election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, a study found that 9.6 percent of the VVPAT tapes were either destroyed, blank, illegible, missing, taped together or otherwise compromised. In one case the thermal paper was loaded into the printer backwards leaving a blank tape, which was not realized by voters who couldn&#x27;t verify the paper trail. The Cuyahoga Election Review Panel proposed in its final report to remove the opaque doors covering the VVPAT except the ones equipped with equipment for blind voters. In general collecting and counting these printed records can be difficult.

Records printed on continuous rolls of paper is more difficult than counting standard paper ballots or even punch cards.

===Privacy ===
DRE VVPAT systems that print the ballot records out in the order in which they were cast (often known as reel-to-reel systems) raise privacy issues, if the order of voting can also be recorded. VVPAT printers that cut the paper after each ballot to form individual ballots can avoid this concern. If there are multiple voting machines it would be more difficult to match between the full voter list and the VVPATs.

Alternatively, an attacker could watch the order in which people use a particular voting system and note the order of each particular vote he is interested in. If that attacker later obtains the paper ballot records she could compare the two and compromise the privacy of the ballot. This could also lead to vote selling and voter intimidation.

In 2007, Jim Cropcho and James Moyer executed and publicized a proof of concept for this theory. Via a public records request, the two extracted voter identification from pollbooks, and voter preference from VVPATs, for a Delaware County, Ohio, precinct with multiple voting machines. Because both sets of records independently established the order of electronic ballots cast, they directly linked a voter&#x27;s identification to his or her preference. Over 1.4 million registered voters in ten Ohio counties were affected. The situation was resolved before the next election by omitting the consecutive numbers on Authority To Vote slips from pollbook records. However, similar vulnerabilities may still exist in other states.

===Effectiveness ===
Also problematic is that voters are not &quot;required&quot; to actually check the paper audit before casting a ballot, which is critical to &quot;verifying&quot; the vote. While the option to look at the paper may provide comfort to an individual voter, the VVPAT does not serve as an effective check on malfunction or fraud unless a statistically relevant number of voters participate.

===Accessibility ===
Current VVPAT systems are not usable by some disabled voters. Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) testified before the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration at a June 2005 hearing on Voter Verification in Federal Elections &quot;The blind cannot verify their choices by means of a piece of paper alone in a manner that is either independent or private. Nor can an individual who has a mobility disability, such as hand limitations, verify a piece of paper alone, if that individual is required to pick up and handle the paper.&quot;

===Reliability ===
VVPAT systems can also introduce increased concern over reliability. Professor Michael Shamos points out that &quot;Adding a paper printing device to a DRE machine naturally adds another component that can fail, run out of ink, jam or run out of paper. If DREs are alleged already to be prone to failure, adding a paper trail cannot improve that record.&quot; In Brazil in 2003, where a small number of
precincts had installed paper trails, failure of the printers delayed voters by as much as 12 hours,
a figure that would be catastrophic in the U.S.

Current implementation of VVPAT systems use thermal printers to print their paper ballot records. Ballot records printed on the thermal paper will fade with time. Also, heat applied to the paper before or after the election can destroy the printing.

===Implementation ===
It can be significantly more difficult to implement a VVPAT as an after-the-fact feature. For jurisdictions currently using DRE voting machines that lack a VVPAT, implementation can be expensive to add and difficult to implement due to the specialized external hardware required. To add a VVPAT component to a DRE machine, a jurisdiction would be required to purchase the system designed by the vendor of the DRE machine with a no bid, sole source purchase contract. That assumes the vendor has designed a component that is compatible with the DRE machine in use. The vendor may not have developed a VVPAT component that is compatible with the DRE machine in use, thus requiring the jurisdiction to purchase an entirely new voting system.

For jurisdictions not currently using DRE machines, the introduction of a new voting system that includes a VVPAT component would have less implementation challenges. Some implementations of the VVPAT place a high cognitive burden on the voter and are extraordinarily error prone.

==Legal questions==
One important question of VVPAT systems is regarding the time of the audit. Some have suggested that random audits of direct recording electronic voting machines be performed on Election Day to protect against machine malfunction. However, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed could create a problem similar to the occurrence in American national elections where a winner is declared based on East Coast results long before polls have closed on the West Coast. In addition, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Others have suggested that random audits of direct recording electronic voting machines be performed after the election or only in the event of a dispute.

In the event an audit is performed after the election and a discrepancy is discovered between the ballot count and the audit count it is unclear which count is the authoritative count. Some jurisdictions have statutorily defined the ballot as the authoritative count leaving the role of an audit in question. Because VVPAT is a recent addition to direct record voting systems the authority question remains unclear.

<text>Are You Normal? is the second studio album by English rock band Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, released on 3 November 1992 by Columbia Records. It features the band&#x27;s biggest American hit &quot;Not Sleeping Around&quot;, which hit the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==Music==
&quot;Are You Normal?&quot; shows the band scaling back on the dual-bass, &quot;punk-pop&quot;-informed grebo sound of their debut album in order to &quot;let the dynamics of the basses soak through the rush of power chords that dominate their early work.&quot; It also shows the band beginning to work with electronics, sampling and &quot;ultramodern production&quot; that the band would continue to explore in their later work. AllMusic said the result is &quot;an almost bouncy, bright album, full of great hooks and lyrical cleverness.&quot;

== Track listing ==
# &quot;Suave And Suffocated&quot;
# &quot;Walking Through Syrup&quot;
# &quot;Legoland&quot;

<doc id="1168398" wikidata="Q369729" url="?curid=1168398" title="Formal organization">
<text>A formal organization is an organization with a fixed set of rules of intra-organization procedures and structures. As such, it is usually set out in writing, with a language of that ostensibly leave little discretion for interpretation.

Sociologist Max Weber devised a model of formal organization known as the bureaucratic model that is based on the rationalization of activities through standards and procedures. It is one of the most applied formal organization models.

In some societies and in some organizations, such rules may be strictly followed; in others, they may be little more than an empty formalism.

* To facilitate the accomplishment of the goals of the organization: In a formal organization, the work is delegated to each individual of the organization. He/She works towards the attainment of definite goals, which are in compliance with the goals of the organization.
* To facilitate the co-ordination of various activities: The authority, responsibility, and accountability of individuals in the organization are very well defined. Hence, facilitating the co-ordination of various activities of the organization very effectively.
* To aid the establishment of logical authority relationship: The responsibilities of the individuals in the organization are well defined. They have a definite place in the organization due to a well-defined hierarchical structure that is inherent in any formal organization.
* Permit the application of the concept of specialization and division of Labor. Division of work amongst individuals according to their capabilities helps in greater specializations and division of work.
* Incite a sense of group cohesiveness.

==Distinction from informal organization==
Formal rules are often adapted to subjective interests—social structures within an enterprise and the personal goals, desires, sympathies and behaviors of the individual workers—so that the practical everyday life of an organization becomes &quot;informal&quot;. Practical experience shows no organization is ever completely rule-bound: instead, all real organizations represent some mix of formal and informal. Consequently, when attempting to legislate for an organization and to create a formal structure, it is necessary to recognize informal organization in order to create workable structures. However, informal organization can fail, or, if already set in order, can work against mismanagement.

Formal organizations are typically understood to be systems of coordinated and controlled activities that arise when work is embedded in complex networks of technical relations and boundary-spanning exchanges. But in modern societies, formal organizational structures arise in highly institutional contexts. Organizations are driven to incorporate the practices and procedures defined by prevailing rationalized concepts of organizational work and institutionalized in society. Organizations that do so increase their legitimacy and their survival prospects, independent of the immediate efficacy of the acquired practices and procedures. There can develop a tension between on the one hand, the institutionalized products, services, techniques, policies, and programs that function as myths (and may be ceremonially adopted), and efficiency criteria on the other hand. To maintain ceremonial conformity, organizations that reflect institutional rules tend to buffer their formal structures from the uncertainties of the technical activities by developing a loose coupling between their formal structures and actual work activities. - (John Meyer and Brian Rowan, 1976)

== Identification numbers and public registers ==
In some countries, formal organizations are registered in public registers to make their identification easier even if an organization renames.

Examples of organization identifiers:
* VAT identification number - usually only organizations that are tax-payers (companies)
* Czech Republic: Identifikační číslo organizace
* Germany: Wirtschafts-Identifikationsnummer
* Poland: REGON (Rejestr Gospodarki Narodowej)
* Brazil: CNPJ

==The Hawthorne experiments==
The deviation from rule-making on a higher level was documented for the first time in the Hawthorne studies (1924–1932) and called &quot;informal organization&quot;. At first this discovery was dismissed as the product of avoidable errors, until it finally had to be recognized that these unwritten laws of work of everyday life often had more influence on the fate of the enterprise than those conceived on organizational charts of the executive level. Numerous empirical studies in sociological organization research followed, ever more clearly providing evidence for this, particularly during the human relations movement. It is important to analyze informal structures within an enterprise to make use of positive innovations, but also to be able to do away with bad habits that have developed over time.

==Reasons for informal organization==

There are many different reasons for informal organization:

*Informal standards: personal goals and interests of workers differ from official organizational goals.
*Informal communication: changes of communication routes within an enterprise due to personal relations between coworkers.
*Informal group: certain groups of coworkers have the same interests, or (for example) the same origin.
*Informal leaders: due to charisma and general popularity, certain members of the organization win more influence than originally intended.
*Different interests and preferences of coworkers.
*Different status of coworkers.
*Difficult work requirements.
*Non-satisfactory conditions of work.

Managerial organization theory often still regards informal organization as rather disturbing, but sometimes helpful. In the opinion of systems theory and cybernetics, however, formal organization fades into the background and only serves, if necessary, to supplement or to correct. Changes in structure always redevelop because of the conduct and differences among coworkers, and the ability of self-organization is recognized as a natural characteristic of a social system.

<text>John Treville Latouche (La Touche) (November 13, 1914, Baltimore, Maryland – August 7, 1956, Calais, Vermont) was a lyricist and bookwriter in American musical theater.

==Biography==

John Treville Latouche was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His family moved to Richmond, Virginia, when he was four months old. There he attended John Marshall High School before going north to Columbia University. He became involved in music and theater, writing for the Varsity Show and joining the Philolexian Society. He did not graduate.

In 1937 Latouche contributed two songs in the revue &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;. For the show &quot;Sing For Your Supper&quot; (1939), he wrote the lyrics for &quot;Ballad for Uncle Sam&quot;, later retitled &quot;Ballad for Americans&quot;, with music by Earl Robinson. It was featured at both the 1940 Republican Convention and the convention of the American Communist Party, and was extremely popular in 1940s America. 

This 13-minute cantata to American democracy was written for a soloist and as well a full orchestra. When performed on the CBS Radio network by singer Paul Robeson, it became a national success. Subsequently, both Robeson and Bing Crosby regularly performed it. Actor and singer Brock Peters also made a notable recording of the cantata.

Latouche provided the lyrics for Vernon Duke&#x27;s songs (including, with Ted Fetter, &quot;Taking A Chance On Love&quot;) for the musical &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1940). He also wrote lyrics for Duke&#x27;s musical &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; (1941), which starred Eddie Cantor. He appeared as The Gangster in the experimental film &quot;Dreams That Money Can Buy&quot; (1947). He returned to music, writing the lyrics for the song &quot;The Girl With the Pre-Fabricated Heart&quot; (music by Louis Applebaum), which accompanies a sequence conceived by French artist Fernand Léger.

Latouche wrote the book and lyrics for &quot;The Golden Apple&quot; (1954) with music by Jerome Moross; it won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Musical. In 1955 he provided additional lyrics for Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. 

Latouche also wrote the libretto to Douglas Moore&#x27;s opera &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot;, one of the few American operas to join the standard repertoire. In 1955, he collaborated with co-writer Sam Locke and composer James Mundy on the Carol Channing vehicle &quot;The Vamp&quot;, which closed after a run of only 60 performances. He had been working with David Merrick on setting the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play &quot;Ah, Wilderness&quot; to music, but died during working on the adaptation. It was later developed as &quot;Take Me Along&quot;.

Latouche was a protégé of James Branch Cabell and friends with writers Gore Vidal and Jack Woodford. Latouche dated Louella Woodford when they were both teenagers. He also was friends of the architect William Alexander Levy (who designed and built Hangover House for travel writer Richard Halliburton), and writer Paul Mooney, who assisted Halliburton in several of his classic travel works.

Latouche died of a sudden heart attack at his home in Calais, Vermont, aged 41.

== Legacy ==
The New York Theatre Company produced &quot;Taking a Chance on Love - The Lyrics and Life of John LaTouche, A New Musical Revue&quot; (&quot;The Bad Boy of Broadway Is Back&quot;) in 2000, with notes by Ned Rorem (recorded by Original Cast Records). 

The John LaTouche Archive, containing journals, family letters, scrapbooks of photographs and newspaper articles, is housed at Columbia University. &quot;Out in the World - Selected Letters of Jane Bowles 1935-1970,&quot; edited by Millicent Dillon (Santa Barbara: Black Sparrow Press, 1985), contains a number of references to LaTouche, and his circle of friends and acquaintances. Chapter 28 of &quot;The Autobiography of Jack Woodford&quot; (Doubleday, Garden City, 1962) is devoted to La Touche.
