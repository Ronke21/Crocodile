<text>The Al-Rahma Mosque () is a Sunni mosque located on Hatherley Street in Toxteth, Liverpool, England, in the United Kingdom. The mosque can accommodate between 2,000 and 2,500 worshippers and serves as the main place of worship and focus point for Liverpool&#x27;s Muslim population, which numbered over 25,000 in the 2021 United Kingdom census.

== History ==
The Liverpool Muslim Society was founded in 1953 by the late Al-Haj Ali Hizzam, a member of Liverpool&#x27;s Muslim community. The Society originally operated from a room in his house where prayer services were held. The Society office is based at the mosque.

The current mosque was built in 1974, ten years after applying for development consent from the city&#x27;s planning department.

The current building is used primarily by the Liverpool&#x27;s Yemenis, Syrians, and Somalis who constitute the vast majority of the city&#x27;s Muslim population.

<doc id="1155350" wikidata="Q1757187" url="?curid=1155350" title="RPO-A Shmel">
<text>The RPO-A Shmel () is a man-portable, single-use, rocket-assisted thermobaric weapon. While its name directly translates to flamethrower (and it is classified as such in Russian military documents), the RPO-A Shmel is more accurately described as a thermobaric weapon.
The &quot;Shmel&quot; is designed, produced and exported by the Russian Federation and previously by the Soviet Union. It entered service with the Soviet Armed Forces at the end of the 1980s as the successor for the RPO Rys.

==Description==
The RPO-A is a single-shot, self-contained tube shaped launcher that operates much like the RPG-18 anti-tank launcher, a sealed tube, carried in a man-pack in pairs. The same person can remove the tube, place it in firing position, and launch the weapon without assistance. After launch, the tube is discarded. All models are externally similar.

Designed to defeat concealed enemy firing positions, disable lightly armored vehicles and destroy enemy manpower. The aiming range with a diopter sight is 600 meters, with an OPO optical sight – 450 m, OPO-1 – up to 850 m.

===Ammunition===
Each weapon contains a single rocket, of which there are three varieties. The basic rocket is the RPO-A, which has a thermobaric warhead and is designed for attacking soft targets under moderate cover. The RPO-Z is a incendiary warhead (from ) designed to spread fire and ignite targets. The RPO-D is a smoke warhead (from ).

==Variants==
An updated development is the improved RPO-M &quot;Shmel-M&quot; that was shown for the first time at Eurosatory 2006. This version is similar to the original weapon, but has a calibre of 90 mm, a weight of , and an overall length of 940 mm. The system has better ergonomics, an improved rocket, and better ballistics and terminal effects. It consists of a disposable launching tube attached to a reusable fire control unit that includes the pistol grip, electronic trigger and safety, and a folding base with an optical sight and additional rail for an infrared/night vision sight. Effective range is 300 m, maximum sighting range is 800 m, and maximum range is 1,700 m. The thermobaric warhead&#x27;s blast effect is equivalent to of TNT, comparable to a 155 mm artillery shell. The &quot;Shmel-M&quot; is also known as RPO PDM-A (from ) and is produced for the local and export markets. A version with a mechanical sight was adopted on 24 December 2003.
The MRO-A is a smaller development of the RPO-series with caliber reduced to 72.5 mm, similar to the RShG-2. It is self-contained, disposable, single-shot recoilless launcher with an overall length of 900 mm, weight of , and has a folding forward grip. The sights are RPO-based, with a fixed front and folding ladder-type diopter rear, giving an effective range of 90 m and maximum range of 450 m. The MRO-series includes different versions, again based on RPO versions: MRO-A thermobaric; MRO-D white phosphorus smoke; and MRO-Z incendiary. It was adopted by the Russian army around 2002 and issued to chemical troops to supplement the larger RPO-A.
MGK &quot;Bur&quot; ( — Compact Grenade-launching System &quot;Auger&quot;) is a 62 mm version of the RPO-M consisting of two major components: the disposable launch tube and reusable fire control unit. Described as &quot;the most compact grenade launcher in the world,&quot; the weapon has an overall length of 742 mm and weighs . Loaded tubes weigh and can fire thermobaric (blast yield similar to of TNT, or a 122 mm artillery rocket) or fragmentation warheads. The fire control unit is the same one used on the RPO-M, weighing and enabling ranges of 25–650 m with the baseline day sight; night and thermal systems are also available. Maximum range is 950 meters, with a firing mechanism service life of at least 500 rounds. It can be fired in confined spaces with a volume of at least 30 cubic meters. As of October 2014, it has been accepted into service and serial production has been started.

==Service history==
RPO weapons have seen use by the Soviet Army in Afghanistan and by both the Russian invasion forces and Chechen resistance forces in the First and Second Chechen Wars. In September 1997, a large number of RPO were included in an arms airdrop to pro-Nguesso forces during the Second Republic of Congo Civil War. On September 3, 2004, Russian forces used RPO-A Shmel as part of the effort to end the Beslan school siege. On 9 August 2014, during the war in Donbas, the Ukrainian border checkpoint of Milove was attacked using RPO thermobaric weapons. The main building was hit by five incendiary rockets. It was used by Indian Army in September 2016 for surgical strike against insurgents in Pakistan-administered Kashmir successfully. It was also used on 8 February 2017 in Ukraine, killing Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic commander Mikhail &quot;Givi&quot; Tolstykh. The munition has seen wide use by the Russian Federation in its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

On October 2, 2023, an attack by presumed PKK members was foiled in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. One attacker was armed with an M4 Carbine and an RPO launcher.

On December 2, 2023, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their first deployment of the weapon during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war to target a specialized Israeli force taking cover in a house in Jabalia, Northern Gaza.

<doc id="1155358" wikidata="Q2415446" url="?curid=1155358" title="Ronnie Ekelund">
<text>Ronnie Michael Ekelund (born 21 August 1972) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as both a midfielder and forward.

He notably played in La Liga for Barcelona and in the Premier League for Southampton and Manchester City. In his native land he played Brøndby IF where he won two Danish football championships and later had spells with Lyngby and Odense Boldklub. He would also play in Ligue 1 with Toulouse and in the English Football League with Walsall before finishing his career in the United States with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes. Ekelund played 21 matches and scored three goals for the Danish under-21 national team and represented Denmark at the 1992 Summer Olympics football tournament. He was named 1988 Danish &quot;under-17 Talent of the Year&quot;.

Following retirement, he briefly played indoor soccer for California Cougars before returning to San Jose Earthquakes for a period as their technical advisor.

==Playing career==
===Brondby===
Ekelund started his professional career with Danish club Brøndby IF in 1988. He made his first team debut at the age of 15, becoming the youngest player ever to appear in the top-flight Danish 1st Division. Ekelund was a part of the 1990 and 1991 Danish championship winning Brøndby team. He played a total 63 games for Brøndby in all competitions.
===Barcelona===
His involvement in the 1992 Summer Olympics impressed defending Spanish La Liga champions FC Barcelona. He joined Danish-Spaniard Thomas Christiansen at FC Barcelona B, the second-string team of the club. Due to league restrictions on the number of foreigners in the playing line-up, Ekelund had a hard time displacing stars like Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Romário in the Barcelona attack. He played a single league match during the 1993–94 season, coming on the field as a substitute and playing 33 minutes, before leaving the club.
===Southampton===
Ekelund went to England, to FA Premier League club Southampton in 1994. In the 1994 pre-season, Southampton and Barcelona stayed at the same hotel during a training camp. Before leaving, Barcelona manager Johann Cruyff asked Southampton manager Alan Ball what he wanted as a parting gift. Ball replied &quot;A left sided midfielder&quot;, and the next day Ekelund was ready to play for the &quot;Saints&quot;. Ekelund was an instant hit at Southampton&#x27;s The Dell stadium with his skills on the ball, forming a great understanding with English forward Matthew Le Tissier, who Ekelund later described as being on level with Ronald Koeman and Romário. Ekelund soon suffered a back injury, and which the Southampton medical team felt that this could only be cured by surgery. As Ekelund refused to &quot;go under the knife&quot;, the disagreement put paid to any hopes of a permanent transfer deal.

Ekelund underwent brief loan deals with English clubs Manchester City and Coventry City, but injuries limited his playing time there. He was loaned out to Danish Superliga club Lyngby FC, playing four games for the club in May 1996.

===Later career===
Ekelund went back to Denmark on a permanent basis in 1996, when he moved to Odense BK. He played two Superliga seasons for Odense, before the club was relegated to the secondary Danish 1st Division. He played one season for Odense in the 1st Division before moving on in the summer 1999.

He moved to French club Toulouse FC in Ligue 2. Ekelund helped Toulouse win promotion for the top-flight Ligue 1 championship, but the manager was fired and Ekelund left the club.
During a training session while on trial with English club Bolton Wanderers in the second-tier Football League First Division, Ekelund suffered an injury which forced him out of the game for three months. When he recovered, Ekelund signed with English team Walsall in the third-tier Football League Second Division in December 2000, to play under manager Ray Graydon who Ekelund knew as a coach from his time at Southampton. Ekelund played nine league games for Walsall, scoring once against Bournemouth. He was offered a new contract by Graydon, but decided to leave Europe in 2001.

In April 2001, Ekelund transferred to US club San Jose Earthquakes in Major League Soccer, who competed with Colorado Rapids for Ekelund&#x27;s signature. Ekelund suffered a knee injury in his first season at Earthquakes, but recovered and soon became ever-present in the starting lineup. With great passing skill and leadership qualities, Ekelund helped the team win the 2001 MLS Cup in his first Earthquakes season. In the following season, Ekelund was named in the 2002 MLS Best XI selection. In 2003, he helped the Earthquakes win the MLS Cup once more, as he scored in the 4–2 win against Chicago Fire. In 2004, the Earthquakes management team changed, and Ekelund was deemed surplus to requirements. In four seasons with San Jose, Ekelund scored 11 goals (five of them penalty kicks) and made 16 assists in the regular season. He also scored a goal and made four assists in the playoffs.

He left the team after the 2004 MLS season, and made the move to indoor soccer in 2005 joining the California Cougars, coached by his good friend and former teammate Troy Dayak. During the 2005–06 season, Ekelund offered his experience to Southampton as a coaching staff member unsuccessfully. He joined the coaching staff of the Earthquakes in 2008 as Technical Advisor, helping with the day-to-day training of the team.

==International career==
Ekelund made his name known when he debuted for the Danish under-17 national team in October 1987. He scored 10 goals in 23 games for the Denmark under-17s, and was named 1988 Danish &quot;under-17 Talent of the Year&quot;. He represented the under-17 national team at the 1989 European Under-17 Championship, and was called up for the Denmark under-21 national football team in June 1990.

He represented the Denmark under-21 team in the 1992 Summer Olympics hosted at Barcelona,

==Personal life==
Ronnie Ekelund and his wife own and operate a small company called &quot;Bébé au Lait&quot;, with Ronnie holding the CEO position at the company. &quot;Bébé au Lait&quot; develops and markets fashionable nursing covers for breastfeeding mothers. According to &quot;Bébé au Lait&quot;&#x27;s website, Ronnie&#x27;s wife invented the Hooter Hiders nursing cover because she wanted to nurse her child discreetly, while attending Ronnie&#x27;s football games. These nursing covers have been endorsed by Hollywood celebrities such as The View&#x27;s Elisabeth Hasselbeck. and Mira Sorvino

<doc id="1155363" wikidata="Q721419" url="?curid=1155363" title="São Januário">
<text>Estádio Vasco da Gama, popularly known as São Januário owing to its location on a street of the same name, is the home ground of CR Vasco da Gama. It is located in the Vasco da Gama neighborhood, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on a hill near the National Observatory of Brazil. Because of its position, it has given Vasco the nickname of &quot;Gigante da Colina&quot; (Giant of the Hill).

São Januário is considered by fans, journalists, professors and politicians as a symbol of struggle and resistance against racism in the history of Brazil. This stadium has also historic importance, because Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas used it many times to deliver speeches to the Brazilian people. Vargas announced the first Brazilian work laws on the tribune of São Januário.

== History ==

After Vasco da Gama won its first Campeonato Carioca in its debut year in 1923, with a squad made up of blacks and workers known as &quot;Camisas Negras&quot; (Black Shirts), the other clubs in Rio de Janeiro founded a new league (AMEA, &quot;Associação Metropolitana de Esportes Atléticos&quot;) and only allowed Vasco to participate if dismissed 12 of his athletes (all black), claiming that they had a &quot;dubious profession&quot; and that the club did not have its own stadium (even though most clubs in the league did not). Faced with the imposed situation, in 1924, the Vasco&#x27;s president, José Augusto Prestes, envied a letter to AMEA, which came to be known as the &quot;Resposta Histórica&quot; (Historical Response), refusing to submit to the imposed condition and withdrawing from membership in the AMEA.

The following year, the club overcame the resistance of the AMEA, managed to join the entity and again competed in the championship under the condition of playing their games in the Andarahy Athletico Club field. Despite this, Vasco decided to build its own stadium, to end any demand. São Januário was erected thanks to the supporters themselves, who led the fundraising campaign to buy the land in São Cristóvão (currently the Vasco da Gama neighborhood), chosen by Vasco because it is São Januário farm, which had been a gift from Dom Pedro I to the Marchioness of Santos, similar to his foundation site.

On April 21, 1927, Vasco da Gama inaugurated the São Januário stadium, the largest stadium in the Americas until 1930, when the Estadio Centenario was inaugurated in Montevideo (for the first World Cup). Until 1940, when Pacaembu was inaugurated in São Paulo, the stadium was the largest in Brazil, and until 1950, when Maracanã was inaugurated, it was the largest in Rio de Janeiro. The stadium had a capacity of 24,584 and it was inaugurated with the presence of Washington Luís, Brazilian president in that time. The first event held in the stadium was a match between Vasco and Santos, which Santos won. The stadium stands as the biggest private venue in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Two years later, its lighting would be inaugurated, becoming the only club in the country with a stadium capable of hosting night games.

=== Renovation ===
In June 2024, the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro approved the São Januário renovation project. The following month, mayor Eduardo Paes sanctioned the reform. The money raised will be through the sale of the land’s construction potential. The capacity will be for around 48,000 fans, with plans to increase it to 57,000.

== Structure ==

=== Aquatics centre ===
The São Januario Aquatics Centre opened on August 30, 1953, and is used by the swimming school. In 1998, it held one event of the FINA Swimming World Cup.

===Courts===
This stadium has two courts. The first opened on September 23, 1956, and it is the main court. In 1999, this court was remodeled and its capacity increased to 2,500 seats. The second court, denominated &quot;forninho&quot; (&quot;little oven&quot; in Portuguese), is smaller than main and it is located behind the Aquatic park.

===Chapel===

A chapel, known in Portuguese as &quot;Capela de Nossa Senhora das Vitórias&quot;, is located between the stadium and the adjacent aquatic park. The project of this chapel was made by Álvaro Nascimento Rodrigues and José Ribeiro de Paiva and it was opened on August 15, 1955.

The importance of this chapel is so big that many projects to remodel the stadium was discarded just because they considered its demolition.

===Trophy room===
Located just after the stadium front door, the trophy room has about 8,000 trophies, cup, plates, medals and photos earnings on the whole club&#x27;s history.

== Social engagement ==
The club has a close relationship with the favela covered by São Januario, known as &quot;Barreira do Vasco&quot; (Vasco&#x27;s Barrier) has social projects in the community, and about 90 employees of the club are local residents. It is a place for fans to meet and celebrate before and after the matches. The favela stands out for its very rich local cuisine and its great connection with Vasco da Gama. The feeling of belonging is reciprocal between the community and the club. And what affects one, consequently affects the other.

The community is made up of street vendors who depend on the games taking place in São Januário to support their families. In 2023, the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office closed São Januário, in a decision called &quot;racist and elistist&quot; by the favela movements. The interdiction of the stadium affected the lives of residents and merchants of the community, who suffered the impacts of the absence of fans there. Because of this, in a match in which Vasco was going to play in Salvador, Bahia, the supporters filled Vasco&#x27;s Barrier to watch the team play on a big screen, helping to boost local commerce.

== Derbies in football ==
Until the construction of Maracanã, Vasco used to play the city derbies at São Januário. After Maracanã was opened, in 1950, the derbies moved to there. Since then, though, a few of those derbies have been played at São Januário, mostly when Maracanã was undergoing refurbishing. On February 14, 2016, Vasco return to play a derby in São Januário since 2005, the match was against Flamengo for the Campeonato Carioca, with Vasco winning, 1–0.

Here is Vasco&#x27;s home record against its major rivals:

<text>Commander James Harmon Ward (September 25, 1806 – June 27, 1861) was the first officer of the United States Navy who was killed during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born at Hartford, Connecticut, Ward received his early educational training in Connecticut common schools before attending the American Literary Scientific and Military Academy at Norwich, Vermont. After graduating in 1823, Ward accepted an appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on March 4, 1823. Subsequently, he served on the frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; during a four-year Mediterranean cruise and then received a year&#x27;s leave of absence for scientific studies at Washington College, Hartford, Connecticut (now Trinity College).

When Ward returned to sea, he served once more in the Mediterranean and then saw duty off the African coast in interdicting the slave trade. He next served in the West Indies, helping to prevent a resurgence of piracy.

Upon his return to the United States, he taught courses in ordnance and gunnery at the Naval School at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These courses were later published as &quot;An Elementary Course of Instruction in Ordnance and Gunnery&quot;.

On October 10, 1845, the new Naval Academy opened in Annapolis, Maryland; Lt. Ward was one of the five founders of this naval academy. He was one of the first line officers to pass along the benefits of his own experience to young midshipmen. One of the most scholarly officers of the Navy of his day, Ward held the office of executive officer (a post which later became that of the Commandant of Midshipmen), with collateral duties as instructor of gunnery and steam engineering.

The advent of the war with Mexico prompted many naval officers and men to seek assignments on ships serving in Mexican waters. Detached from the Academy, Ward took command of the in 1847 and served in that capacity for the duration of the war. After a period spent waiting for orders, he was given command of the steamer in 1848 and remained on her through 1850.

After intermittent periods awaiting orders and serving at the Washington and Philadelphia Navy Yards, Ward took command of the and took her to the African coast to hunt slave ships. During this time, in his off-duty hours, he proceeded to work on another textbook—&quot;A Manual of Naval Tactics&quot;—a scholarly work which would run to four editions after its initial publication in 1859.


In 1860, Ward served at the New York Navy Yard, where he wrote a popular treatise on steam engineering, entitled &quot;Steam for the Million&quot;. In the spring of 1861, with the Southern states leaving the Union and Confederate forces mounting a siege at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Gideon Welles summoned Ward to Washington to plan for a relief expedition for Sumter. Ward volunteered to lead it, but opposition, notably from General Winfield Scott (who perceived it as being futile), forced cancellation of the plans.

Ward pressed for front line service, proposing that a &quot;flying squadron&quot; be established in the Chesapeake Bay for use against Confederate naval and land forces threatening that area south of the Union capital. The idea was approved, and the squadron took shape. With the steamer &quot;Thomas Freeborn&quot; serving as Ward&#x27;s flagship, the steamers &quot;Freelance&quot;, &quot;Alliance&quot; plus three coastal survey ships made up his flotilla.

The newly composed unit—later known as the Potomac Flotilla—saw its first action on June 1, when guns from Ward&#x27;s ships silenced Confederate shore batteries at Aquia Creek, Virginia during the Battle of Aquia Creek. On June 27, at the Battle of Mathias Point, Ward sent a landing party ashore to dislodge Southern forces from another battery at Mathias Point, in King George County, Virginia, but it encountered heavy resistance. The Federals gave up the attack and retired under heavy sniper and cannon fire to their ships. Ward brought his flotilla in close to the shoreline to provide gunfire support for the retreating landing party. As he was sighting the bow gun in his flagship, &quot;Thomas Freeborn&quot;, Ward was struck by a bullet in his abdomen and fell to the deck, mortally wounded. He died within an hour.
He was the great-grandfather of actor Andy Devine.

==Namesakes==
USS &quot;Ward&quot; (DD-139) was named for him, as was
Fort Ward, one of the defenses of Washington during the American Civil War.

Ward Hall, site of the US Naval Academy&#x27;s computing center, is named after James Ward, first commandant of midshipmen.

<doc id="1155382" wikidata="Q349473" url="?curid=1155382" title="Lucas Radebe">
<text>Lucas Valeriu Ntuba Radebe OIS (born 12 April 1969) is a South African former professional footballer who played as a centre back.

He began playing in South Africa with Kaizer Chiefs, before transferring to Leeds United, where he played 262 matches for the Yorkshire side. During his spells at these clubs, he picked up the nicknames &quot;Rhoo&quot; and &quot;The Chief&quot;. He became captain of Leeds United and also of the South African national team, most notably at 2002 FIFA World Cup. Nelson Mandela said of Radebe: &quot;This is my hero.&quot; He also captained Kaizer Chiefs during his time at Chiefs.

==Early life==
Radebe was born to Emily and Johannes Radebe in the Diepkloof section of Soweto, near Johannesburg, as one of 11 children. He attended the local Bopasenatla Secondary School until he was 15 years old. His parents sent him to one of the former homelands in Grade 10, Bophuthatswana, as a way to keep him safe from the violent neighbourhood of Diepkloof Zone Four in Soweto. There he attended Ngotwane High School near Zeerust.

==Club career==
===Kaizer Chiefs===
After playing for amateur side ICL Birds in the now-defunct Bophuthatswana Soccer League, and was spotted by Patrick Ntsoelengoe who recruited him to one of South Africa&#x27;s top clubs, the Kaizer Chiefs, in 1989. Radebe originally started his career with the Kaizer Chiefs as a goalkeeper, and then switched positions to central midfield and then finally to central defence.

===Leeds United===
In 1994, Radebe and another South African player, Philemon &quot;Chippa&quot; Masinga, moved to Leeds United for a transfer fee of £250,000. Radebe was only included in the deal to keep Masinga happy; as it turned out, he became the more valuable investment.

Initially the move was not a success; Radebe did not agree with then Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson, and suffered injuries which prevented him for earning a regular first team place.

Radebe returned to the goalkeeper position in March 1996, replacing John Lukic in the position after he suffered an injury in the second half of a defeat to Middlesbrough. Radebe would again play in the goalkeeper position the following month when goalkeeper Mark Beeney was sent off for handling the ball outside his area in the 17th minute against Manchester United. Radebe was brought on as a substitute in place of Mark Ford, and despite Leeds losing 1–0, Radebe earned &#x27;cult-hero&#x27; status at the club due to his performance.

However, when Wilkinson was replaced by George Graham, his career flourished and Radebe was made captain of the team for the 1998–99 season. Whilst he was captain, Leeds enjoyed a period of relative success; in the 1998–99 season, they finished fourth in the FA Premier League, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. During the 1999–2000 season, Leeds finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the following season&#x27;s Champions League, where they eventually reached the semi-finals. During this time, Radebe turned down the chance to move to Manchester United, AC Milan and Roma. Alex Ferguson commented at the time, &quot;Everyone should be interested in Lucas.&quot;

In 2000, he was awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award.

However, in 2000 Radebe sustained serious knee and ankle injuries, which kept him out of the game for almost two years, and subsequently found it difficult to regain his form and his place in the team.

==International career==
Following the end of apartheid, Radebe made his debut for South African national team in their first international match on 7 July 1992 against Cameroon.

Having recently recovered from a long-term knee injury, he was a member of the South African team that won the 1996 African Cup of Nations.

Radebe was also the captain of the South African national football team during both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. South Africa failed to reach the knockout stages on both occasions; however Radebe did get on the score sheet in 2002.

He earned 70 caps for South Africa and scored two goals during his international career, with his last match being against England on 22 May 2003.

After retiring, Radebe was influential in South Africa&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup. He could also be seen working as a pundit for South African television, and during ITV&#x27;s coverage of the tournament.

==Style of play==
Thebe Mabanga, a Mail &amp; Guardian journalist, wrote that South African fans remember Radebe in his Kaizer Chiefs days as &quot;a lanky, flamboyant central midfielder who switched to central defence with ease, snuffing out any opposition threat with exquisite, acrobatic scissor kicks and diving headers, and man-marking the most lethal strikers into silence&quot;.

==Post-playing career==
At the end of the 2005 season, Radebe retired from professional football. Leeds held a testimonial for Radebe at Elland Road on 2 May 2005 attended by a crowd of over 37,886. Radebe also held a retirement match in Durban, South Africa between a South African Invitation XI and Lucas Radebe All Stars at Kings Park Soccer Stadium. The proceeds from both of these matches were combined with other money raised and donated to charity.

On 28 August 2006, Radebe announced that he was going back to Leeds after failing to secure a job with the World Cup hosts to be involved in the set-up of Bafana Bafana. He said he was &quot;tired of waiting for unreliable people&quot; who had allegedly promised him a role in the national team set up as the South African Football Association prepared to host the next World Cup in 2010.

In 2008, a local Leeds brewery asked for suggestions for a new beer; the most popular suggestion was &quot;Radebeer&quot;, showing the Leeds fans&#x27; admiration of Radebe.

On 8 October 2009, The English Football Association announced Radebe as an ambassador to help boost the 2018 World Cup bid.

A biography, &quot;Lucas: From the Streets of Soweto to Soccer Superstar&quot; by Richard Coomber was published in 2010.

In May 2010 he won the PFA Merit Award for his contribution to football.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Radebe was a pundit for ITV&#x27;s match coverage and also a columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Radebe revealed in September 2010 that he would like to manage Leeds United in the future and also manage the South African national side. He said both jobs were the only coaching jobs that he would consider. In July 2012, it was announced that Radebe had accepted a position as team manager with the South African national side.

In October 2013, Radebe announced that he was set for another emotional return to the Elland Road ground at Leeds, to be presented to the crowd on Sunday, 30 October 2013.

On 23 January, it was confirmed that Boxer Josh Warrington would fight IBF world champion Lee Selby (26–1) in his first world title fight on 19 May at Elland Road with Radebe joining Warrington for the ringwalk. On 19 May, Warrington secured a split-decision victory over Selby to claim the title. With Radebe as part of Warrington&#x27;s ringwalk and band Kaiser Chiefs also played songs at the event.

==Personal life==
In 1991, he was shot whilst driving with his brother Lazarus to buy drinks for his mother but was not critically wounded. When Leeds United confirmed their interest in 1994, Radebe&#x27;s decision influenced in part by an incident that had taken place three years previously.
Radebe was shopping for his mother, accompanied by his brothers, one of his sisters and her baby. While walking, they heard a gunshot, but didn&#x27;t pay it much attention because, says Radebe: &quot;In Soweto you heard shots all the time&quot;. He felt a pain in his back and he was bleeding, and his left leg went limp. 
Radebe was rushed to hospital but nothing vital had been damaged. The bullet had entered his back and exited halfway down his thigh. The culprit is still unknown, it is suspected that someone was hired to shoot him rather than allow him to switch clubs.

He was voted 54th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

His wife Feziwe died of cancer in October 2008. In December 2008, Radebe was treated for a heart complaint after collapsing while at the gym. Radebe married his second wife at the end of 2015.

==Legacy==
Kaiser Chiefs, a British indie/britpop band, whose members are all Leeds United supporters, chose this name because Radebe is a former player of Kaizer Chiefs.

Radebe has been an ambassador of FIFA for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages; he also received the FIFA Fair Play Award in December 2000 for his contribution in ridding soccer of racism as well as for his work with children in South Africa.

In April 2003, for recognition of his efforts both on an off the field, Radebe was given the Contribution to the Community Award in the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards.

On an official visit to Leeds, Nelson Mandela said of Radebe: &quot;This is my hero.&quot;

<text>Castleblayney (; ) is a town in County Monaghan, Ireland. The town had a population of 3,926 as of the 2022 census. Castleblayney is near the border with County Armagh in Northern Ireland, and lies on the N2 road from Dublin to Derry and Letterkenny.

==Geography==
The town lies above the western shore of Lough Muckno, the largest lake in County Monaghan. The River Fane flows eastwards from the lake to the Irish Sea at Dundalk in County Louth. As the Irish name of the lake (&#x27;the place where pigs swim&#x27;) suggests, the area is associated with the Black Pig&#x27;s Dyke, also known locally in parts of Counties Cavan and Monaghan as the Worm Ditch, an ancient Iron Age boundary of Ulster.

A few miles to the north-east is the highest elevation in County Monaghan, &#x27;Mullyash&#x27;, at altitude 317 m (1,034 ft).

==History==
The area was originally known as &quot;Baile na Lorgan&quot; (&quot;town of the long low ridge&quot;), anglicised as &#x27;Ballynalurgan&#x27;. It was also sometimes called &quot;Caisleán Mathghamhna&quot;.

===17th and 18th centuries===
The town of Castleblayney originated in the Tudor conquest of Gaelic Ulster in the Nine Years&#x27; War of 1594–1603. In 1611, the Crown granted forfeited lands in the area previously owned by the MacMahon chieftains to Sir Edward Blayney of Montgomeryshire in Wales for his service to Queen Elizabeth I. Sir Edward was later created The 1st Baron Blayney, in July 1621. King James I had already granted him appropriated Augustinian church land (or &#x27;termon&#x27;) at Muckno Friary on the northeastern side of the lake in the Churchill area (Mullandoy) in 1606/7. The small town &#x27;founded&#x27; by Sir Edward Blayney in 1611 or 1612 is recorded as being called &quot;Castleblayney&quot; at least as early as 1663.

Muckno is also the name given to the Catholic parish (St. Mary&#x27;s, Castleblayney, and St Patrick&#x27;s, Oram, just three miles north-east of the town), which is part of the Diocese of Clogher. The Church of Ireland parish is also called Muckno (St Maeldoid&#x27;s), and is part of the Church of Ireland Diocese of Clogher.

In 1762 a demonstration occurred in the town accompanied by a threatening military presence. This was connected with the &#x27;Oakboys&#x27; movement that was active in the county. The protest was about compulsory work – to repair public roads as well as private roads and avenues in demesnes owned by the gentry – that was exacted from agricultural labourers for no wages.

===The 11th Baron Blayney===

The modern planned town – reminiscent of Plantation towns with its characteristic wide main street and with long, narrow individual gardens to the rear and out of sight – dates from c. 1830. The modern town was largely laid out under the direction of Andrew Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney (1770–1834), who inherited the family peerage and the large Blayney Estate as an adolescent in 1784. By about 1800 the then young Lord Blayney had ordered and implemented major reforms in Castleblayney, greatly improving the prosperity and appearance of the town. Educated in France and Germany, the 11th Lord Blayney is famous for his distinguished military career, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General, having served in the West Indies, South America, southern Africa and the Napoleonic Wars as commander of the 89th Foot, popularly known as &#x27;Blayney&#x27;s Bloodhounds&#x27;. As a peer, he was very active in the suppression of the revolt of the United Irishmen in 1798.

It was the 11th Lord Blayney who had the modern Blayney Castle (also known as Castle Blayney) constructed around the year 1800. In 1799 Lord Blayney commissioned Robert Woodgate, a former student of Sir John Soane, to design the new Blayney Castle. Woodgate, a distinguished young architect, had first come over to Ireland in 1791 to supervise Soane&#x27;s plans for Baronscourt, the new country house of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, near Newtownstewart in County Tyrone. The new Blayney Castle was built in a restrained late Georgian style. It is thought that this new &#x27;castle&#x27; (in reality a country house), located in the townland of Onomy, was built close to the site of the original Blayney Castle, of which nothing now survives above ground. The house built for the 11th Lord Blayney was later, in the 1850s and early 1860s, substantially altered and enlarged for Henry Thomas Hope and his wife.

Blayney Castle, renamed Hope Castle in the early 1850s, stands in a demesne or park on the eastern edge of Castleblayney town itself. It is thought that this demesne pre-dates the current &#x27;castle&#x27;; that large parts of it had already been laid out by the early 1770s. The demesne was substantially improved for the 11th Lord Blayney by William Sawrey Gilpin in the early 1830s. However, the demesne has deteriorated since it came into public ownership in the 1980s. Almost all of the large Italianate Victorian extension to Hope Castle was demolished by Monaghan County Council in the 1980s.
The 11th Lord Blayney also provided for the erection in Castleblayney of the current church buildings of the Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches, being tolerant in religion if traditionalist in politics and strongly supportive of Empire and the Anglo-Irish &#x27;Ascendancy&#x27;. Apart from the former Alms Houses (1876), which were interdenominationally managed, Castleblayney Town Hall (1790) is the only building of architectural merit.

In the early 1840s, what is now St Mary&#x27;s Hospital was erected as a Workhouse for the very poor.

===Hope family and after===
In 1853, Cadwallader Blayney, 12th Baron Blayney, sometime Member of Parliament for Monaghan, sold Blayney Castle and what remained of the Blayney Estate to Henry Thomas Hope from Deepdene in Surrey, an extremely wealthy businessman who had also formerly served as a Member of Parliament at Westminster. The 12th Baron was the last Baron Blayney. The Castle was renamed &#x27;Hope Castle&#x27;, as it is still called. Hope gave the Georgian castle with its splendid prospect a Victorian makeover that the present prettified building retains, externally at least. &#x27;Castle&#x27; has always been a misnomer, since it was more of a &#x27;Big House&#x27;, mansion or manor house than a castle.

After his death in 1862, Hope&#x27;s wife Anne inherited the estate. Soon after 1887 the Castle and demesne fell to the next heir, Hope&#x27;s grandson Lord Francis Hope (1866–1941), who was famous for having sold the renowned family heirloom, the &#x27;Hope Diamond&#x27;. Rather like his father The 6th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, Lord Francis lived very extravagantly and, despite his once vast family fortune, was declared bankrupt in 1896. From 1894 to 1902, he was married to May Yohé, the American actress. After 1916 Lord Francis no longer resided in the Castle or in Ireland. He succeeded his elder brother to become The 8th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne in late May 1928.

Hope Castle was leased between 1900 and 1904 to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, a son of Queen Victoria. The Duke served during those years as the commander of British military forces in Ireland, whose official residence was the Master&#x27;s House at the Royal Hospital, in Kilmainham, Dublin. The Duke leased Hope Castle from the Pelham-Clinton-Hope family as his private country residence during these years.

The 8th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1866–1941; previously known as Lord Francis Hope) sold his life interest in the castle and the estate in 1928. 
Between 1919 and 1921, during the Anglo-Irish military hostilities over independence, the Castle was used as a barracks by the British Army. For some time afterwards it functioned as a hospital, and from 1943 to 1974 it was occupied by Franciscan nuns who also managed an adjacent guesthouse. In the 1980s Monaghan County Council purchased both Hope Castle and its surrounding demesne or park. It then proceeded in the 1980s to demolish the large Italianate Victorian extension to the castle. The council also allowed the remaining Woodgate interiors to be ripped out at this time. In October 2010 the castle was burnt down in an arson attack.

On 7 March 1976, a bomb exploded in the town&#x27;s main street, outside the Three Star Inn pub, killing one and injuring 17 others. The attack was one of several cross-border attacks linked to the Glenanne gang during the worst sectarian violence of The Troubles.

==Council==
The modern town of Castleblayney is administered by Monaghan County Council. It forms part of the Carrickmacross-Castleblayney Municipal District which elects six of the eighteen members of the council.

For over one hundred and sixty years the town had its own local or Town council until May 2014. Town government began in Castleblayney on 17 May 1853 when 21 Town Commissioners were elected on foot of a proclamation by Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, dated 10 April 1853. In 1865 the Town Commissioners voted to bring the town under the Town Improvement (Ireland) Act 1847 and in 1899 the nine Town Commissioners were replaced by an Urban District Council, re-designated as a Town Council under the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 brought town government to an end replaced it with the integrated municipal district (town and rural areas) and county system.

==Facilities==

Amenities in Castleblayney include a Community Enterprise Centre which opened in 1987.

==Transport==
The town is served by Bus Éireann, Ulsterbus and several private coach companies.

A €120m by-pass from Castleblayney to Clontibret opened on 5 November 2007, linking Castleblayney directly to the M1 Motorway and to Dublin. The bypass consists of 16 kilometres of 2+1 carriageway.

Castleblayney is no longer served by railway. Castleblayney railway station opened on 15 February 1849, closed to passengers on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.

==Arts and culture==
The Íontas Arts &amp; Community Resource Centre is an arts and community facility located in a purpose-built facility in the town. It offers a wide range of arts activities, including drama, music and dance.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic football club, Castleblayney Faughs GFC, was founded in November 1905. Castleblayney Hurling Club was founded in 1906.
There are also two soccer clubs located in Castleblayney, Blayney Academy FC formed in 2010 and Blayney Rovers FC.

==Education==
The town has two second-level schools, Our Lady&#x27;s Castleblayney and Castleblayney College.

There are five national schools in Castleblayney; Scoil na gCailíní, Scoil Mhuire na mBuachaillí, Convent Junior School, The Central School and Gaelscoil Lorgan.

<text>Haweswater is a reservoir in the valley of Mardale, Cumbria in the Lake District, England. Work to raise the height of the original natural lake was started in 1929. It was controversially dammed after the UK Parliament passed a local act of Parliament, the Manchester Corporation Act 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. cxix), giving Manchester Corporation permission to build the reservoir to supply drinking water to the city. The decision caused a public outcry because the farming villages of Measand and Mardale Green would be flooded and the valley altered forever.

The reservoir is now owned by United Utilities. It supplies about 25% of the North West&#x27;s water supply.

==Etymology==
Haweswater is derived from Old Norse or Old English. &#x27;Hafr&#x27;s lake&#x27; refers to the personal Norse name &#x27;Hafr&#x27; or in Old English &#x27;Hæfer&#x27;; &#x27;water&#x27; or &#x27;wæter&#x27; is the dominant term for &#x27;lake&#x27; in old English.

== Geology ==
Haweswater is the location of a caldera volcano succession.

==History==

Haweswater was originally a natural lake about long. A tongue of land at Measand divided the lake almost in two. The upper and lower reaches of the lake were known as High Water and Low Water.

In 1929 work started to build the dam wall across the valley floor. At the time of construction, its design was considered to be at the forefront of civil engineering technology because it was the world&#x27;s first hollow buttress dam. The wall would be created from 44 separate buttressed units joined by flexible joints. When the dam was completed by 1935, it measured long and high. It has a wide parapet that runs atop the length of the dam. Building supplies were brought to the site from the adjoining valleys of Heltondale and Swindale. When the valley was flooded, the dam raised the water level by . This created a reservoir long and up to across at its widest point. It holds up to of water. 
Before the valley was flooded in 1935, all the farms and dwellings of the villages of Mardale Green and Measand were demolished, as well as the centuries-old Dun Bull Inn at Mardale Green. The village church was dismantled and the stone used in constructing the dam; all the bodies in the churchyard were exhumed and re-buried at Shap.

Today, when the water in the reservoir is low, the remains of the submerged village of Mardale Green can still be seen, including stone walls and the village bridge.

Manchester Corporation built a new road along the eastern side of the lake to replace the flooded highway lower in the valley, and the Haweswater Hotel was constructed midway down the length of the reservoir as a replacement for the Dun Bull. The road continues to the western end of Haweswater, to a car park, a popular starting point for a path to the surrounding fells of Harter Fell, Branstree and High Street.
==Wildlife==
===Fish===
There is a population of schelly fish in the lake, believed to have lived there since the last Ice Age.

===The RSPB at Haweswater===
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) first became involved at Haweswater because of the presence of golden eagles – the first to return to England in over 170 years. The organisation currently leases two farms in the area and has rights to their associated common land.

Until 2015, Haweswater was the only place in England where a golden eagle was resident. A pair of eagles first nested in the valley of Riggindale in 1969, and the male and female of the pairing changed several times over the years, during which 16 chicks were produced. The last female bird disappeared in April 2004, leaving the male alone.
There was an RSPB viewpoint in the valley for people wishing to see the eagle. The last sighting was in November 2015, and it was reported in 2016 that the 20-year-old bird might have died of natural causes.

Since 2012, the RSPB has leased two farms from the landowner United Utilities. The aim is to combine the improvement of wildlife habitats and water quality, with running a viable sheep farm. Moorland and woodland habitats are being improved for birds as well as the rare small mountain ringlet butterfly. Measures include grip blocking, where the water level of drainage ditches is raised to encourage re-vegetation and reduce erosion, heather replanting, and juniper woodland planting (especially in the ghylls).

The RSPB have established the largest native tree and plant nursery in the Lake District. Seed is collected from the existing plants and trees on-site, grown in the nursery and planted to restore the landscape.

==Literary references==
Hawes Water is described in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; (1864).

Lake District writer and fell walker Alfred Wainwright had this to say on the construction of the Haweswater Dam in his 1955 book &quot;A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;:

&quot;Haweswater&quot; is a 2002 novel by British writer Sarah Hall, set in Mardale at the time of the building of the dam and flooding of the valley. It won the 2003 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for a First book. The novel was released in the United States as a paperback original in October 2006, by Harper Perennial.

The RSPB&#x27;s site manager at Haweswater, Lee Schofield, published &quot;Wild Fell: Fighting for Nature on a Lake District Hill Farm&quot; (2022), a personal account of the charity&#x27;s work at the site.

<text>John Paul &quot;JP&quot; Dellacamera (born January 11, 1952) is an American play-by-play sportscaster primarily for Major League Soccer with the Philadelphia Union, as well as major soccer tournaments and ice hockey. 

==Early life==
Dellacamera grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts and graduated from Waltham High School in 1970. He studied broadcasting at Grahm Junior College and spent much of the 1970s as a minor league hockey announcer. In 1982, he got his start as a soccer announcer with the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League.

==Commentary career==

===Minor League Hockey===
Considered the &quot;Godfather of Erie, Pennsylvania Hockey Broadcasters&quot;, Dellacamera was the first hockey radio announcer in the Erie when hired by the Erie Blades ahead of the team&#x27;s first season in 1975 as the public relations director and broadcaster. Previously, Dellacamera had been in the North American Hockey League (1973–1977) with the Long Island Cougars, and accepted the Blades job after the Cougars ceased operations. 

Dellacamera called Blades games on WLKK from 1975-1982. Blades&#x27; public address announcer and back-up radio broadcaster John Leisering took over broadcast duties for Dellacamera when he left for the Pittsburgh Spirit.

===Soccer===
In the 1980s, Dellacamera was the play-by-play announcer for broadcasts of the original Major Indoor Soccer League on ESPN and FNN-Score.

He was ESPN and ABC&#x27;s play-by-play announcer for their coverage of international soccer, and has been calling the sport for nearly 30 years. Dellacamera did not call the 2006 World Cup, with Dave O&#x27;Brien replacing him, but teamed with Tommy Smyth to become the lead radio commentary team for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for ESPN Radio.

His most famous assignments include eight UEFA Champions League finals and the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final between the United States and China. That match ended in a 0–0 tie after regulation, with the U.S. women winning in a penalty kick shootout 5–4 (&quot;The shot-&quot;save, Scurry!&quot;&quot; was one of Dellacamera&#x27;s most memorable calls from that day&#x27;s shootout, coming from U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry&#x27;s save on China&#x27;s third kick of the shootout). He has also called numerous United States&#x27; World Cup qualifiers, including Paul Caligiuri&#x27;s famed 1989 &quot;Shot Heard Round the World&quot; goal against Trinidad &amp; Tobago.

In 2001, he was the lead play-by-play announcer for the WUSA national broadcasts on TNT and CNN/SI. Dellacamera was NBC&#x27;s play-by-play voice for soccer at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he did both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments. He also did play-by-play for the New York Red Bulls on MSG Network for several years.

Dellacamera was the first host of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;PressPass&quot; alongside analysts Tommy Smyth and Eddie Mighten. The show airs on ESPN&#x27;s African, Pacific Rim, and Middle East channels, in addition to ESPN360. Dellacamera has been replaced by Derek Rae, and Mighten has been replaced by Janusz Michallik.

Dellacamera served as the lead play-by-play announcer for NBC Sports coverage of Soccer at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

On January 16, 2010, Major League Soccer expansion team Philadelphia Union announced that Dellacamera will do play-by-play for local TV broadcasts during its inaugural season. He called Union matches through the end of their local TV contract after the 2022 season.

In March 2011, Dellacamera left ESPN to join Fox Soccer as their lead MLS play-by-play commentator. However, in November 2011, the NBC Sports Network signed a deal with the league to broadcast all league matches starting in the 2012 season. Fox re-gained rights in time for the 2015 season and Dellacamera reunited with Fox through the 2022 season. He also continued his duties with the Philadelphia Union and even called Union games on Fox broadcasts.

Starting in 2013, Dellacamera will do play-by-play for the New York Cosmos on ONE World Sports when games do not interfere with Union broadcasts.

In 2014, he was a play-by-play commentator for ESPN Radio for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was the play-by-play commentator for ONE World Sports&#x27;s coverage of the 2015 Asian Cup.

In 2018, he was a featured commentator alongside Tony Meola on FOX and FS1 for their United States broadcasts of the FIFA World Cup. He also was the 2018 recipient of the National Soccer Hall of Fame&#x27;s Colin Jose Media Award. In 2021 JP took the position of President of Communications/Media of the Major Arena Soccer League.

In 2022, Dellacamera returned to call his ninth World Cup in Qatar and his second with Fox Sports. Then, he returned to call the Copa America in the United States. Calling matches with him both tournaments was former USMNT midfielder and Los Angeles Galaxy player/broadcaster Cobi Jones.

===National Hockey League===
In addition to soccer and a few other sports, Dellacamera is a veteran NHL announcer. In the early 1990s, he was a part of the Chicago Wolves for two seasons, being the first play-by-play person on the team. From 2003-04 through 2008-09 he was the television play-by-play voice of the Atlanta Thrashers, and previously served as one of ESPN&#x27;s many play-by-play commentators. Possibly due to his extensive work in soccer, Dellacamera is one of the few hockey play-by-play broadcasters to use &quot;goal&quot; in his goal calls (i.e. instead of saying &quot;he takes the shot and scores,&quot; Dellacamera will say &quot;takes the shot, goal&quot;). Earlier in his career he did play-by-play for both the EHL Long Island Ducks and NAHL Long Island Cougars.

===World Junior Hockey===
Dellacamera served as the play-by-play announcer for all US National Team games on the NHL Network during the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Dellacamera replaced Gary Thorne, who was originally scheduled to announce the games.

<doc id="1155426" wikidata="Q742419" url="?curid=1155426" title="List of presidents of Iran">
<text>This is a list of the presidents of the Islamic Republic of Iran since the establishment of that office in 1980. The president of Iran is the highest popularly elected official in the country. The current president, Masoud Pezeshkian has been in office since 28 July 2024 after winning the 2024 Iranian presidential election.

==Background==
After the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and referendum to create the Islamic Republic on March 29 and 30, the new government needed to craft a new constitution. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered an election for the Assembly of Experts, the body tasked with writing the constitution. The assembly presented the constitution on October 24, 1979, and Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini and Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan approved it. This was also approved in constitutional referendum on December 2 and 3.

The 1979 Constitution designated the supreme leader as the head of state and the president and prime minister as the heads of government. The post of prime minister was abolished after the 1989 constitutional referendum.

The first Iranian presidential election was held on January 25, 1980 and resulted in the election of Abolhassan Banisadr with 76% of the votes. Banisadr was impeached on June 22, 1981 by Parliament. Until the early election on July 24, 1981, the duties of the president were undertaken by the Provisional Presidential Council. Mohammad-Ali Rajai was elected president on July 24, 1981 and took office on August 2. Rajai remained in office for less than one month, with both he and his prime minister being assassinated on August 30, 1981. Once again, a Provisional Presidential Council filled the office until October 13, 1981 when Ali Khamenei was elected president.

Ali Khamenei, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Rouhani were each elected president for two terms. Ebrahim Raisi was the eighth president, serving from his election in 2021 until his death on May 19, 2024 leaving the office occupied in an acting capacity by First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber. Masoud Pezeshkian was elected as the current president on July 6, 2024.

<doc id="1155437" wikidata="Q3391396" url="?curid=1155437" title="Flowstone">
<text>Flowstones are sheetlike deposits of calcite or other carbonate minerals, formed where water flows down the walls or along the floors of a cave. They are typically found in &quot;solution caves&quot;, in limestone, where they are the most common speleothem. However, they may form in any type of cave where water enters that has picked up dissolved minerals. Flowstones are formed via the degassing of vadose percolation waters.

Flowstone may also form on manmade structures as a result of calcium hydroxide being leached from concrete, lime or mortar. These secondary deposits created outside the cave environment, which mimic the shapes and forms of speleothems, are classified as &quot;calthemites&quot; and are associated with concrete degradation.

==Formation==

Flowing films of water that move along floors or down positive-sloping walls build up layers of calcium carbonate (calcite), aragonite, gypsum, or other cave minerals. These minerals are dissolved in the water and are deposited when the water loses its dissolved carbon dioxide through the mechanism of agitation, meaning it can no longer hold the minerals in solution. The flowstone forms when thin layers of these deposits build on each other, sometimes developing more rounded shapes as the deposit gets thicker.

There are two common forms of flowstones, tufa and travertine. Tufa is usually formed via the precipitation of calcium carbonate, and is spongy or porous in nature. Travertine is a calcium carbonate deposit often formed in creeks or rivers; its nature is laminated, and it includes such structures as stalagmites and stalactites.

The deposits may grade into thin sheets called &quot;draperies&quot; or &quot;curtains&quot; where they descend from overhanging portions of the wall. Some draperies are translucent, and some have brown and beige layers that look much like bacon (often termed &quot;cave bacon&quot;).

Though flowstones are among the largest of speleothems, they can still be damaged by a single touch. The oil from human fingers causes the flowing water to avoid the area, which then dries out. Flowstones are also good identifiers of periods of past droughts, since they need some form of water to develop; the lack of that water for long periods of time can leave traces in the rock record via the absence or presence of flowstones, and their detailed structure.

===Concrete derived flowstone===
Flowstone derived from concrete, lime or mortar, can form on manmade structures, much more rapidly than in the natural cave environment due to the different chemistry involved.
On concrete structures, these secondary deposits are the result of concrete degradation, when calcium ions have been leached from the concrete in solution and redeposited on the structure&#x27;s surface to form flowstone, stalactites and stalagmites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is absorbed into the hyperalkaline leachate solution as it emerges from the concrete. This facilitates the chemical reactions which deposits calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on vertical or sloping surfaces, in the form of flowstone.

Concrete derived secondary deposits are classified as &quot;calthemites&quot;. These calcium carbonate deposits mimic the forms and shapes of speleothems, created in caves. e.g. stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone etc. It is most likely that calthemite flowstone is precipitated from leachate solution as calcite, &quot;in preference to the other, less stable polymorphs, aragonite and vaterite.&quot;

Other trace elements such as iron from rusting reinforcing or copper oxide from pipework may be transported by the leachate and deposited at the same time as the CaCO3. This may cause the calthemites to take on colours of the leached oxides.

==Uses==
Cave onyx is any of various kinds of flowstone considered desirable for ornamental architectural purposes. &quot;Cave onyx&quot; was a common term in certain areas of the United States—particularly the Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia area and the Ozarks—during the 19th and early 20th centuries, being applied to calcite speleothems that were banded in a way suggestive of true onyx.

There are a number of US caves called &quot;Onyx Cave&quot; because of the presence in them of such deposits.

<doc id="1155466" wikidata="Q2165768" url="?curid=1155466" title="KEK">
<text>, known as KEK, is a Japanese organization whose purpose is to operate the largest particle physics laboratory in Japan, situated in Tsukuba, Ibaraki prefecture. It was established in 1997. The term &quot;KEK&quot; is also used to refer to the laboratory itself, which employs approximately 695 employees. KEK&#x27;s main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics, material science, structural biology, radiation science, computing science, nuclear transmutation and so on. Numerous experiments have been constructed at KEK by the internal and international collaborations that have made use of them. Makoto Kobayashi, emeritus professor at KEK, is known globally for his work on CP-violation, and was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==History==
KEK was established in 1997 in a reorganization of the Institute of Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo (established in 1955), the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (established in 1971), and the Meson Science Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (established in 1988). However, the reorganization was not a simple merge of the aforementioned laboratories. As such, KEK was not the only new institute created at that time, because not all of the work of the parent institutions fell under the umbrella of high energy physics; for example, the Center for Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo, was concurrently established for low energy nuclear physics in a research partnership with RIKEN.

* 1971: National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) was established.
* 1976: The proton synchrotron (PS) produced an 8 GeV beam as designed. The PS achieved 12 GeV.

* Institute of Particle and Nuclear Studies: Pedestal physics laboratory to study elementary particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics.
* Institute of Materials Structure Science: Applied physics laboratory to study material structures.
* Applied Research Laboratory: Laboratory used to support research using particle accelerators.

Scientists in KEK conduct training for PhD course students of the School of High Energy Accelerator Science in the Graduate University for Advanced Studies.

== Location ==
* Tsukuba Campus: 1-1 Oho, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0801, Japan
* Tokai Campus: 2-4 Shirane Shirakata, Tokai-mura, Naka-gun, Ibaraki 319-1195, Japan

== Particle accelerators ==

=== Current complex ===

* SuperKEKB: A electron-positron collider and upgrade to KEKB. With two storage rings: a 7 GeV electron storage ring and a 4 GeV positron storage ring. The circumferential length is about 3.016 km. Large quantities of B-mesons and anti-B-mesons will be generated providing data for the Belle II experiment.
* Photon Factory (PF): A electron storage ring is used for synchrotron light experiments. The circumferential length is about 187 m. The energy of the electron beam is 2.5 GeV.
* Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR): An electron storage ring is used for synchrotron light experiments. This accelerator generates high intensity and pulsed X-ray with the electron beam of 6.5 GeV. The circumferential length is about 377 m. This ring used to be operated as a booster synchrotron for TRISTAN, electron-positron collider, and called TRISTAN Accumulation Ring (AR) originally.
* KEK e+/e- Linac: A linear accelerator complex used to inject 8.0 GeV electrons and 3.5 GeV positrons to KEKB. The linac also provides 2.5 GeV electrons for PF and 6.5 GeV electrons for PF-AR. The Linac has in recent years been upgraded for SuperKEKB.
* Accelerator Test Facility (ATF): A test accelerator is focused on generating a super low-emittance beam. This is one of the essential techniques for realizing a future electron-positron linear collider. The beam energy of electrons is 1.28 GeV in normal operation.
* Superconducting RF Test Facility (STF): A test facility to build and operate a test linac with high-gradient superconducting cavities, as a prototype of the main linac systems for International Linear Collider (ILC).
* Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC): A proton accelerator complex consisting primarily of a 600 MeV linac, a 3 GeV synchrotron and 50 GeV synchrotron. J-PARC was built with a collaboration between KEK and JAEA, and is used for nuclear physics, particle physics, muon science, neutron science, Accelerator-Driven System (ADS) and a range of other applications.
* KEK digital accelerator (KEK-DA) is a renovation of the KEK 500 MeV booster proton synchrotron, which was shut down in 2006. The existing 40 MeV drift tube linac and rf cavities have been replaced by an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source embedded in a 200 kV high-voltage terminal and induction acceleration cells, respectively. A DA is, in principle, capable of accelerating any species of ion in all possible charge states.

=== Shutdown complex ===
* Proton Synchrotron (PS): An accelerator complex to accelerate protons up to 12 GeV. PS had consisted primarily of a 750 keV pre-accelerator, a 40 MeV linac, a 500 MeV booster synchrotron and a 12 GeV main ring. PS had been used for nuclear and particle physics. PS also had provided the 12 GeV proton beam to a neutrino beam line in KEK for a KEK to Kamioka (K2K) experiment. PS achieved its design energy of 8 GeV in 1976. PS was shut down in 2007.
* Neutrino Beam Line: A beam line to drive neutrinos into Super-Kamiokande, which is about 250 km away from KEK, and a neutrino oscillation experiment named K2K had been conducted from 1999 to 2004. A neutrino oscillation experiment named Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) has been conducted using J-PARC since 2009.
* Transposable Ring Intersecting Storage Accelerator in Nippon (TRISTAN): An electron-positron collider had been operated from 1987 to 1995. The main purpose was detecting top quark. The electron and positron energy were 30 GeV. TRISTAN had three detectors: TOPAZ, VENUS and AMY. KEKB was built through the use of the tunnel of TRISTAN.

=== Running and future plans ===
* SuperKEKB: An electron-positron collider, consisting of a 7 GeV electron storage ring and a 4 GeV positron storage ring, to achieve higher luminosity by means of increasing the beam current, focusing the beams at the interaction point and making the electromagnetic beam-beam interactions small. The target luminosity has been set to 8×1035 cm−2 s−1, about 60 times higher than the KEKB&#x27;s original design value. SuperKEKB has adopted a nano-beam scheme. KEK will build a new damping ring in order to generate the nano scale positron beam. On October, 2010 the Japanese government formally approved the SuperKEKB project, and in June 2010 an initial budget of 100 million dollars (¥100 = $1) for a Very Advanced Research Support Program was assigned for 2010-2012. The total budget is about 315 million dollars (¥100 = $1) by the program. The upgrade will be completed, and the first collisions have been conducted in 2018. The highest luminosity will be achieved in 2021. Belle II experiment will be conducted using SuperKEKB.
* Compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL): A test accelerator for a future synchrotron light source named Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). cERL will study the uncertainty of the accelerator physics in the ERL through the beam experiments. The beam commissioning in cERL will be scheduled from 2013 with a 35 MeV electron beam. KEK has a plan that will build 5 GeV ERL, provides ultra-high brightness and ultra-short pulsed synchrotron light, after the cERL experiments.
* International Linear Collider (ILC): A future electron-positron linear collider consisting of superconducting cavities with a length of approximately 31 kilometers in length and two damping rings, for electrons and positrons, with a circumference of 6.7 kilometers. The electron and positron energy will be up to 500 GeV with an option to upgrade to 1 TeV. Nearly 300 laboratories and universities around the world are involved in the ILC: more than 700 people are working on the accelerator design, and another 900 people on detector development. The accelerator design work is coordinated by the Global Design Effort, and the physics and detector work by the World Wide Study.

== Computers ==

KEK has computers which are fastest class in Japan, and Computing Research Center in KEK manages the computer systems. The theoretical operation performance of SR16000, a super computer made by Hitachi, is 46 TFLOPS. The theoretical operation performance of Blue Gene Solution, a super computer made by IBM, is 57.3 TFLOPS. These super computers had been used to study quantum chromodynamics and numerical accelerator physics mainly, and these super computers have been shut down in order to introduce a next super computer in the future. Computing Research Center also manages the other computer systems: KEKCC, B-factory Computer System and Synchrotron Light Computer System.

KEK hosted the first web site in Japan on September 30, 1992. The original web site can still be seen.

<text>Elizabethtown College (informally Etown) is a private college in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
Elizabethtown College was founded in 1899 by members of the Church of the Brethren in response to an initiative by Jacob G. Francis. Francis advocated for Elizabethtown because of the proximity to the railways. First classes for the new college were held on November 13, 1900, in the Heisey Building in downtown Elizabethtown. During its first two decades, the college operated as an academy, offering a limited curriculum centering on four-year teaching degrees and high school type classes.

===1920–1950===
In 1921, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction accredited the college, and authorized its first baccalaureate degrees in arts and sciences. Later, in 1928, the college was approved by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for pre-law education. In 1948, Elizabethtown College became accredited by the Middle States Association.

===Honors program===

Established in 1999, the Elizabethtown College Honors Program is a member of the National Collegiate Honors Council. The Honors Program was founded with an endowment gift from The Hershey Company.

==Student life==
The Office of Student Activities (OSA) serves as a co-curricular educator and facilitator in creating a social environment, such as through its T.G.I.S. and Student Involvement Fairs.

Elizabethtown offers student-run media that include a newspaper—&quot;The Etownian&quot;; a literary magazine—&quot;Fine Print&quot;; a television station—ECTV-40; a radio station—WWEC 88.3 FM; and a yearbook—the &quot;Conestogan&quot;. Elizabethtown is affiliated with the Brethren Colleges Abroad (BCA) program, which allows students to study abroad.

<text>Sonsoles Espinosa Díaz (born 8 November 1961) is a Spanish classical singer and music teacher. She is married to José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, former President of the Government (&quot;Presidente del Gobierno&quot;.

==Biography==
She was born in Ávila, the daughter of a military officer, and received a law degree from the Universidad de León. She met Rodríguez Zapatero in León in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters, born in 1993 and 1995.

Sonsoles is a soprano and music teacher, and several times she stated she loves singing soft rock music. While living in León, she was a member of the city&#x27;s prestigious university choir and used to be a music teacher for seven to nine pupils at one of León&#x27;s and Spain&#x27;s most prestigious schools, Colegio Leonés. Since moving to Madrid she has continued to sing, as a substitute member of the chorus at the city&#x27;s opera house, the Teatro Real, and more recently with the choir of the government-owned broadcasting service RTVE.

In 2003, she gave an interview to the magazine &quot;La Razón&quot;, where some of her opinions about abortion generated controversy, mainly from right-wing think tank groups. She said abortion should be legal in all countries and that &quot;those who don&#x27;t understand this are people from the 18th century.&quot;

<text>Allen Clayton Hoskins (August 9, 1920 – July 26, 1980) was an American child actor, who portrayed the character of Farina in 105 &quot;Our Gang&quot; short films from 1922 to 1931.

==Acting career 1920–1936==

=== &quot;Our Gang&quot; ===

==== Stardom ====

Born in Boston in 1920, Allen Clayton Hoskins was just one year old when his tenure with &quot;Our Gang&quot; began. His character stayed in the series through the silent years and the transition to talking pictures, and he left the series in 1931 at the age of eleven. With his pigtailed hair and patchy outfits, Farina resembled a pickaninny in the tradition of the character Topsy from &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, but as the character became more popular, and as Allen Hoskins got older, Farina developed his own personality separate from that of Topsy. The name &quot;Farina&quot;, derived from a type of cereal, was chosen because its gender was ambiguous: As a toddler, Farina was portrayed as both a boy and a girl, sometimes both genders in the same film.

He was born in Boston in 1920, but soon afterward his parents, Clayton H. Hoskins and Florence A. Fortier Hoskins, moved the family to Los Angeles and in 1922 his acting career began. His younger sister Jannie also appeared in the series as &quot;Mango&quot; (1926–1929) and Hoskins&#x27;s aunt, Edith Fortier, was his guardian on set, his parents divorced in 1926. By that time he was 6 years old and an experienced child actor, and as &quot;Farina&quot; he made more money than most working adults.

The &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies were created by Hal Roach Studios, located in Culver City, California. School was required for child actors. Hoskins and the other Roach studio children attended school on the lot at the &quot;Little Red School House&quot;. The children were taught by Fern Carter. In 1959, a retrospective article about Fern Carter and her career as a teacher in Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Little Red School House&quot; was published. The article explained that she was teaching there when the series began in 1921 and taught over 300 students in a career that lasted 23 years. She often said that Farina was the brightest student she ever had.

The Studio was a family affair and often relatives, staff and other Roach Studio stars appeared in cameo roles or as extras in many of the films including Harold Lloyd, Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, Ernie Morrison&#x27;s father, Ernie Morrison Sr. and Fern Carter&#x27;s daughter, Wadell Carter. In 1929 Hoskins&#x27; aunt and guardian on set, Edith Fortier, also appeared as an extra in the films &quot;Noisy Noises&quot; and &quot;Small Talk&quot;.

In addition to acting in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short films, the children also made personal appearances. In 1927, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; published an article about such an appearance. &quot;Countless millions of boys and girls have seen &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies but this good luck doesn&#x27;t befall orphans very often. East Bay orphans, however, are going to get their chance to see these popular screen stars in person...&quot;

During his time in the Gang, Farina became both the series&#x27; anchor and its most popular character. While he was not the first black child actor (or even the first black &quot;Our Gang&quot; kid), Farina became arguably the first black child star. Hoskins&#x27; last contract with the Hal Roach Studio called for $350 a week, more than any other cast member was earning at that time. When he finally outgrew the series, he was replaced by Matthew Beard in 1931.

==== Aging ====

When his career in &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies ended because of his age, several newspaper columnists took notice. In 1931, Columnist Jack Lait wrote the following in his &quot;Highlights of Broadway, from the Circle to the Square&quot; column:
On the same date, a column, with no byline, was published in &quot;The Register&quot; of Sandusky, Ohio:
At the end of the studio&#x27;s 1930-1931 season, Hoskins aged out. Other child actors were let go at the same time, including Norman &quot;Chubby&quot; Chaney and Mary Ann Jackson. While working as actors, all the children attended parties and special events at the studio, including Christmas, when they received any gift they asked for. In January 1931 Farina was a star, earning $350 a week, but by July 1931 he was unemployed.

==== In contemporary press ====
In 1928, when Joe Cobb became too old for his part, 20,000 boys auditioned to replace him in a contest sponsored by Roach.

In 1926, several newspapers, including one in Lima, Ohio, carried a story about Farina simply because (it was reported) he wanted to quit playing a girl. &quot;But of course you may not know that Allen Clayton Hoskins is the &quot;sure-enough&quot; name of Little Farina who is having a birthday party out in Hollywood today...now he&#x27;s getting pretty big and he wants to wear trousers and be a boy on the screen as well as off it...&quot;
Exactly one year later (again on his birthday) the same newspaper carried a new story about how Farina learned to act (from his &quot;brother&quot;, who did not exist).

Hoskins did not have a brother, but he did have a younger sister, Jannie. She rated her own story when she, too, began to appear in the comedies in 1926. The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; carried a &quot;Movieland&quot; column out of Hollywood, by Jack Wooldridge: &quot;Janie [&quot;&quot;] the little sister of Farina had been added to the cast of &quot;Our Gang&quot; at the Hal Roach Studios...Janie is two years, 4 months old, black as midnight and all animation...&quot;
Many stories about the Gang appeared from time to time and these were carried in various newspapers throughout the country. Most of them were related to release of a new film. The films, called &quot;shorts&quot;, were usually two reels in length and local trade papers, such as &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture World&quot;, wrote about the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts every time a new one appeared. In 1923 alone, fourteen were released. The children were stars to their fans, both children and adults. The early comedies were silent, but when talkies emerged the studio quickly made this transition and so did Farina. Maltin wrote in his book about the excitement when the first talkie by &quot;Our Gang&quot; was released 

As an indication of Hoskins&#x27;s popularity, the song &quot;Lil&#x27; Farina (Ev&#x27;rybody Loves You),&quot; words by Harrison G. Smith and music by Alvano Mier, was published in 1925. The cover included a photograph of Hoskins (with his screen and real names), and an approbation from Harold Lloyd.

The fact that all of the children would eventually grow too old and their contracts would not be renewed was also considered newsworthy. An article that appeared in a 1937 Abilene, Texas, newspaper attempted to explain how this worked. 

=== After &quot;Our Gang&quot;: Vaudeville and other work ===
After Hoskins grew too old for his part, in 1931, he returned to Roach Studios for several cameo appearances but was not chosen for a long-term role. He was given a cameo role in an unusual short film called &quot;The Stolen Jools&quot;. 

After his career with the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies ended in 1931, Farina and his sister Jannie toured in a vaudeville act accompanied by their mother, Florence Hoskins, in 1932. The exact dates that they toured are not known, but early 1932 found them on tour in Jefferson City, Missouri. The article notes &quot;...Today you are to have the opportunity to see him in person at the Miller Theater. Accompanied by Mango, his sister, the star will do a comedy skit...&quot; The article also praises the other two acts. &quot;...The Five Juggling Jewels...are all that their name suggests when it comes to juggling Indian Clubs... [and] &quot;Diversion A La Carte&quot; offered by Jack Fulton and Peggy Parker...just good fun and songs and that&#x27;s enough...&quot;
In February 1932, they performed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 2010, Toronto columnist and historicist Jamie Bradburn published a retrospective piece about the events surrounding Farina&#x27;s vaudeville appearance in Toronto in February 1932: &quot;Like children elsewhere across the continent, young Toronto moviegoers in the 1920s and 1930s eagerly awaited the next instalment of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series of shorts...Having grown out of &quot;Our Gang&quot; after 1931&#x27;s &quot;Fly My Kite&quot;, Hoskins and his younger sister, (aka Mango) developed the vaudeville act that brought them to Toronto... On matinee day the &quot;STAR&quot; featured a front page interview with both children and their mother. Reporter Archibald Lampman (not the nineteenth century poet) noted that Janey &quot;didn&#x27;t think we were so hot&quot;. Bradburn notes that the girl&#x27;s instincts were on target as the printed interview with &quot;the doggy pickanins of the movies&quot; was a shambling sometimes condescending affair. The occasion was special and the newspaper set up &quot;chairs all around&quot; Bradburn goes on to say that &quot;...Lampman made lame attempts to act as if he was trying to keep up the façade of dignified reporter before giving in to a case of the cutes whenever Hoskins flashed a toothy grin...&quot; The engagement began on February 12, 1932, with a Friday night spot as a special attraction at the Imperial Theatre...The next morning they performed at a matinee at the Imperial, then made brief appearances for adoring fans at two Kresge stores...&quot;

Many of the original advertisements and photographs are included in this article. The siblings are pictured together signing a copy of the &quot;Just Kids Safety Club&quot; card sponsored by &quot;The Globe&quot; (a copy of the card with his signature and his Los Angeles address are displayed in the column). There is also mention of an interview with Farina&#x27;s mother. &quot;Mrs. Hoskins hinted at the discrimination the family faced, noting that she seemed far more accepted on the west coast than the east. With a voice that Lampan described as &quot;flowing like an old darky melody&quot; she praised the efforts of Scopes Trial Lawyer Clarence Darrow to improve conditions for blacks in America (presumably a reference to the Ossian Sweet case) and believes that her children&#x27;s generation would overcome prejudice...&quot; Also of interest is an advertisement promoting Farina&#x27;s singing ability: &quot;...Appearing this week at the Imperial Theatre, [he] will entertain you...singing the sensational hits &quot;Home (Where Shadows Fall),&quot; &quot;Fox Trot&quot; and &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot;, waltz. Copies of these songs, 25 cents at Kresge&#x27;s stores...&quot;

While Hoskins did find some work after Farina, it was short term. Soon after leaving &quot;Our Gang&quot; one of his first roles was as the &quot;Host&quot; of the 13th episode of the &quot;Voice of Hollywood&quot; (second series). Among the guests were John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Jackie Coogan, but this was just a one-time event. In 1933 Hoskins, along with fellow graduates Mickey Daniels, Joe Cobb and Mary Kornman returned to &quot;Our Gang&quot; for an encore appearance in &quot;Fish Hooky&quot;, but nothing more came of it. Hoskins kept his relationship with the studio, though, and in 1936 he was part of an &quot;Our Gang&quot; tour and later appeared with the &quot;Gang&quot; on the &quot;You Asked for It&quot; show in the 1950s.

After his vaudeville appearances, Hoskins returned to Los Angeles, where he auditioned for movie roles. When he appeared in his first full-length movie, &quot;You Said a Mouthful&quot; starring Joe E. Brown, various papers carried the &quot;news&quot; that Farina cut off his braids for the movie and placed them in the family Bible. After this movie ended, Hoskins continued to audition for other movie roles. From 1932 to 1936 he made appearances in seven full-length films, but most were not credited and his career in movies did not flourish.

== World War II ==

In 1940 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Selective Service Act. Hoskins volunteered to serve in the Army in August 1940, shortly before the first draft registration took place on September 16, 1940. In 1941 Hoskins was stationed at Monterey, California, where a reporter found him:&lt;br&gt;
In one of her 1945 columns (published in various newspapers including the &quot;Lowell Sun&quot;) Louella Parsons wrote about Hoskins and other actors who served in World War II. &quot;No one at Fort Roach knew the drama back of Sgt. Allen Hoskins appearance there on his last day in the Air Corps. As a boy, twenty years ago Sergeant Hoskins was Farina, in the Hal Roach Comedies. Hoskins saw action in five major Pacific battles and received a presidential citation. He expects to write and produce for the stage and has a musical he wrote in Australia.&quot;

Parsons went on to write: 

At the close of World War II in 1945, Hoskins was now 25. After his tours of duty he sought to audition for parts outside of the Roach studios but was not selected, even by those studios he knew well. Hoskins started to drift away from performing and retired his stage name.

On the July 24th, 1953 episode of the program You Asked For It that reunited some members of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; cast, Hoskins explained why he abandoned acting: &quot;I preferred a job that allowed me to eat regular.&quot;

== House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) ==
Hoskins had survived the war but could not find work back in Los Angeles as an actor. To make matters worse, he was then called for questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). HUAC was a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives created in 1938 to investigate possible communist activities in the United States. Many industries were investigated, but it was Hollywood that received the most publicity.
A retrospective Associated Press article appeared in an Odessa, Texas, newspaper in 1979:
== Professional rehabilitation career, 1955–1980 ==
Known to his friends as Al, he and his wife, Franzy, moved in the 1950s to Santa Rosa, where they raised their children and where he began his career in the field of rehabilitation. The exact date he began working at Sonoma State Hospital, located in Eldridge, California, is not known, but by 1963 he was the Sheltered Workshop Director. In addition to working full time, he became concerned about the problems of youth in the South Park area of Santa Rosa, where they lived. In his spare time he developed a proposal for &quot;Weekend House - an Evening and Weekend Training and Counseling Center&quot; for youth. In the Introduction he wrote, &quot;The beginnings of future problems if not met now, can and will develop into serious community problems that left to its own uncontrolled development, will lead to the type of area and social breakdown that have been experienced by other communities in the past...&quot; Part of the problem, he stated, was that &quot;...there are no parks or recreational facilities in the district...&quot; . In his proposal, Hoskins identified these issues and offered solutions. A copy of this survives, but it is not known if he submitted it to the local government.

In 1965 he left Sonoma State Hospital for a better position, and the family moved to Hayward, California. He was now the Sheltered Workshop Director at the Walpert Center, part of the Association for Retarded Children of Southern Alameda County. His career was followed in the local papers, not because he had been a child star called &quot;Farina&quot;, but because of his work as an advocate for disabled people. In 1966 he appeared in the local paper, &quot;The Argus&quot;, reporting on the Workshop&#x27;s effort to seek funding to complete an expansion: &quot;We&#x27;re using every inch of available space...We think we have a worthwhile program and we&#x27;d like the chance to do an even better job and serve more people...&quot;

In 1968 an article appeared in the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; regarding his efforts to strengthen Sheltered Workshops in his area: 

In February 1969, Hoskins was chosen to be Director of the 10th Annual Conference on Rehabilitation Workshops. &quot;The problems of administrating and operating Rehabilitation Workshops for the Handicapped is the subject of the California Association of Rehabilitation Workshops&#x27; 10th annual conference... Allen Hoskins, director of the Hayward Retarded Children&#x27;s Center, 1101 Walpert St. is the program director for this year&#x27;s convention.&quot;

Under his guidance, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; reported that the workshop was now employing 1,000 clients, double what it had the previous year. &quot;Handicapped workers represent a vast economic resource which has been barely tapped,&quot; according to Hoskins, who was also at that time President of the Bay Area Association of Rehabilitation Workshops, which represented 40 Workshops in the Bay Area.

Hoskins spoke at a press conference marking the observance of Workshop Week, which was proclaimed by Mayor John H. Reading of Oakland and other mayors throughout the state. &quot;I have yet to find a business operation in which there is not some item of work which could not be best handled by one of our shops&quot;, Hoskins said...&quot;they&#x27;re a sleeping giant...You call us and we&#x27;ll survey your company, tell you what we can do for you and make you an offer... What we&#x27;re looking for is work not a handout.&quot;

While working full time, Hoskins also continued to develop creative projects and opened his own studio. In 1976 the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; reported that he was volunteering to help young actors learn their craft at a local nonprofit group, the Experimental Group Young People&#x27;s Theatre Co., where he was an advisor to the group, &quot;...volunteering his expertise...&quot;

== Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, 1975 ==

Hoskins was still active in his professional rehabilitation career in 1975 when he was chosen, for his work as an actor, to be inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame at the second annual Oscar Micheaux Award ceremony held at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. Also honored that year were Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Ruby Dee and Quincy Jones. He was interviewed about his career then and now: 

In his acceptance speech, Hoskins asked the question, &quot;What is success?&quot;, and part of his answer was, &quot;I didn&#x27;t get to do what I wanted so I did something I could live with. I think one thing that&#x27;s been very important to me is that I try not to live in the past.&quot; He also thanked the audience: &quot;...I want to thank each and every one of you. I&#x27;m sure glad you didn&#x27;t forget me.&quot;

==Retrospective 1979==

One year before his death, a retrospective article about his life was published and was printed in various newspapers. &quot;Allen Hoskins says he has fond memories of playing Farina in &quot;Our Gang&quot; about 50 years ago but he hasn&#x27;t any residuals. &#x27;I&#x27;m sick and tired of people thinking I get residuals or payment for replays of the still popular series,&#x27; Hoskins said in a recent interview. &#x27;I haven&#x27;t got no pot of money, I have never tried to trade off the name Farina, I haven&#x27;t done that – I don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; Instead the 58-year-old Hoskins said he struggled through years of house painting and dishwashing before landing his present job as Public Information Officer for the Alameda County Chapter of the Association for Retarded Children.&quot;

==Death==
Hoskins died of cancer on July 26, 1980, in Oakland, California. Many newspapers, including the &quot;Farmington Daily Times&quot;, carried the story of his death &quot;...he died Saturday after being admitted in a coma...His wife Franzy, was at his bedside along with his daughter Candy and his son Chris...at the time of his death she said he had been involved in starting a radio series and headed his own projects company known as ALFRAN...&quot;

His wife, Franzy, continued to reside in the Bay Area until her death in 2010, and his sister, Jannie (&quot;Mango&quot;), also resided in Northern California until her death in 1996.

Hoskins was buried without a headstone in an unmarked grave in Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland. It was not until twenty years after his death that Hoskins received a proper headstone, through the efforts of Jan Turner and the Find A Grave website in 2000 (listed under Find A Grave Memorial #8483).

<doc id="1155510" wikidata="Q727226" url="?curid=1155510" title="W. Haydon Burns">
<text>William Haydon Burns (March 17, 1912 – November 22, 1987) was an American politician. He was Mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 1949 to 1965, and served as the 35th Governor of Florida from 1965 to 1967.

==Early life==
Burns was born in Chicago, Illinois. His family moved to Jacksonville in 1922, where he attended Andrew Jackson High School before going on to attend Babson College in Massachusetts. Before the outbreak of World War II he was an appliance salesman and a flight school operator. During the war, he joined the U.S. Navy and was posted as a technical officer in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. Following the war, he returned to Jacksonville and began a public relations and business consulting firm and worked selling appliances.

==Mayor of Jacksonville==
In 1949 Burns, a segregationist, announced his intention to run for Mayor of Jacksonville against incumbent C. Frank Whitehead. He defeated Whitehead in the Democratic Party primary, and then faced Jacksonville businessman William Ashley, a Democrat running as a political independent, in the general election – an unusual occurrence, as Democrats had been dominant in city politics for decades. On June 21, 1949, Burns defeated Ashley to become the mayor of Jacksonville.

Burns&#x27;s first term was an abbreviated two-year stint; he was thereafter re-elected four times, the longest consecutive stint of any mayor in the city&#x27;s history. During his time in the mayor&#x27;s office, he oversaw massive growth in Jacksonville. He promoted the city around the world in an attempt to lure international investments and to get corporations to relocate offices to the city. He commissioned the production of a slide show called &quot;The Jacksonville Story&quot;. Hundreds of audiences around the world saw it. The American National Exhibit showed a film version in the Soviet Union. Burns personally made presentations at The Hague and in Israel. He made &quot;The Jacksonville Story&quot; known from coast to coast, and so was Jacksonville&#x27;s mayor.

He was elected president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, president of the Florida League of Municipalities, and delegate to the International Congress of Municipalities. While mayor, he won tax breaks for insurance companies and Prudential Insurance relocated from New Jersey to a skyscraper in Jacksonville. Other insurance companies followed, and Jacksonville became known as the insurance capital of the South.

A new courthouse and City Hall were built on the site of rotten wharves, and a long-promised Civic Auditorium was built on the banks of the St. John&#x27;s River. Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum and Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park made the city thoroughly modern. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, today CSX, moved from Wilmington, North Carolina, to the Jacksonville riverfront. The world&#x27;s largest Sears Roebuck store opened on what once was skid row. A modern expressway system took shape and the city got the Jacksonville Suns baseball franchise and a hockey team.

The city faced many problems during Burns&#x27;s term. As a segregationist running on his ability to control Jacksonville’s racial conflicts, he deputized even firefighters to strengthen the city’s police force to resist integration. Racial violence ignited on August 27, 1960, during a protest to integrate downtown lunch counters in the Hemming Park shopping area. Segregationists responded by attacking the protesters with baseball bats and ax handles; the day is remembered as Ax Handle Saturday. Burns tried to blame the shameful incident on visitors but the police chief attributed the attacks to locals. The city&#x27;s police department was ridden with scandal and multiple grand jury indictments were handed down on public officials all around him.

One of his final acts as mayor was his handling of the Hotel Roosevelt fire in downtown. Although 23 people died, many other hotel guests survived. In 1964 he announced he would be stepping down as mayor to run for Governor of Florida. City Commissioner Lou Ritter was appointed to take his place.

==Governorship==
Burns defeated Republican Charles Holley in the November 3 general election to become Governor of Florida. He was sworn in on January 5, 1965, to serve an abbreviated two-year term. This short term came about because the cycle of gubernatorial elections was changed so as not to coincide with presidential election years. While in office, he oversaw progress in the development of a new state constitution, as well as new areas of outdoor recreation and industry. Also, Governor Burns opposed the death penalty and allowed no executions (the last pre-Furman execution in Florida took place in 1964).

In 1961 and 1962, he served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

On November 15, 1965, at a news conference in Orlando, Governor Burns introduced Walt and Roy Disney to Florida as they announced that the state would be the location of their &quot;East Coast Disneyland&quot;, Walt Disney World.

The 1966 gubernatorial elections pitted the sitting governor against Robert King High, a popular Miami politician. This primary was significant because Burns represented the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and High was the choice of the liberals from South Florida. Governor Burns lost the 1966 Democratic primary and then did not support High in the general election. Political observers in Florida point to High&#x27;s supposed failure to obtain such endorsement from Burns because of Burns&#x27;s conservative views on civil rights. This left the party divided in the face of united Republican support for Claude Kirk. He left office on January 3, 1967, as the first Democratic Governor of Florida in history to be succeeded by a Republican since Reconstruction.

==Post-governorship==

After his term ended, the governor returned to private business consulting in Jacksonville. In 1971, he made an attempt to be reelected mayor, but he was defeated by incumbent Hans Tanzler in the Democratic primary. Many of the projects that he helped to create, such as the Civic Auditorium, rebuilt in 1996 and renamed the Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts, Wolfson Park, City Hall and the Jacksonville Coliseum, have all been replaced with newer structures. However, his work for the city&#x27;s growth remains evident today. Haydon Burns remained in Jacksonville until his death in 1987.

Jacksonville&#x27;s main public library, built in 1965, was named the Haydon Burns Library in honor of the former mayor. It was designed by Taylor Hardwick, a local architect who designed many local structures built in Jacksonville. From 1965 to 2005 it was the main library of Jacksonville. In 2005 it was replaced by a new Main Library.

In 1966, the building located at 605 Suwannee Street in Tallahassee, Florida, opened and was named the W. Haydon Burns Building. It became home to the State Road Department, now the Florida Department of Transportation.

In 2004, the city of Jacksonville renamed the old City Hall, built by Burns, as the Haydon Burns City Hall Annex.

<text>USS &quot;Niagara&quot; (SP-263) was a vessel of the United States Navy during World War I.

&quot;Niagara&quot;, a yacht built in 1915 by E. A. Fonda of Miami, Florida, was purchased by the United States Navy on 5 July 1917 from General H. M. Creel, of Miami, and was designated USS &quot;Niagara&quot; (SP-263). The navy redesignated the boat as &quot;SP-263&quot; on 11 April 1918, dropping the name &quot;Niagara&quot;.

After the war, on 29 May 1919, she was transferred to the United States Lighthouse Service, converted into a lighthouse tender and rechristened USLHT &quot;Poinsettia&quot;. She was assigned to the 7th Lighthouse District in Key West, Florida.

&quot;Poinsettia&quot; was decommissioned on 21 April 1922 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was sold.
She caught fire and sank on 27 December 1928.

<doc id="1155516" wikidata="Q21718894" url="?curid=1155516" title="Shim (spacer)">
<text>A shim is a thin and often tapered or wedged piece of material, used to fill small gaps or spaces between objects. Shims are typically used in order to support, adjust for better fit, or provide a level surface. Shims may also be used as spacers to fill gaps between parts subject to wear.

== Materials ==

Many materials make suitable shim stock (also often styled shimstock), or base material, depending on the context: wood, stone, plastic, metal, or even paper (e.g., when used under a table leg to level the table surface). High quality shim stock such as laminated shims can be bought commercially, but shims are often created ad hoc from whatever material is immediately available.

Laminated shim stock is stacked foil that can be peeled off one layer at a time to adjust the thickness of the shim.

== Applications ==

In automobiles, shims are commonly used to adjust the clearance or space between two parts. For example, shims are inserted into or under bucket tappets to control valve clearances. Clearance is adjusted by changing the thickness of the shim. 

In assembly and weld fixtures precision metal shims are used between two parts so that the final production parts are created within the product drawing&#x27;s specified tolerances. 

On machinery installations (pumps, motors, etc.) the recommended practice requires shims under every equipment support foot. This guarantees a flexibility for adjustments, like a slight raising or lowering of a motor, when parts of the machinery need to be replaced.

In carpentry, small pieces of wood may be used to align gaps between larger timbers.

In masonry, small stones may be used to align or fill gaps between larger bricks or slabs.

In luthiery, a thin strip of various materials (most often steel or wood) can be used beneath the nut or the saddle of a stringed instrument (such as a guitar, mandolin, ukulele or banjo) to raise the height of either.
On guitars with a bolt-on or screwed-on neck, the angle of the neck can be adjusted by shimming. On some models a strip of sanding paper was routinely inserted during final adjustment at the factory. Guitarists have often used strips cut from business cards, credit cards or picks as shim material, while luthiery supply stores have started to sell specialized hardwood precision wedges for that purpose.

On printed circuit boards, special CPU shims are used to protect the central processing unit when installing a heat sink.

In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, &quot;&quot;shimming&quot; an NMR magnet&quot; is a procedure to generate homogeneous magnetic field along the sample volume to obtain pure Lorentzian line shapes of various resonances in the spectrum. This is accomplished by manual shimming of individual shims, or automatic shimming procedure. 

Shims play a vital role in the construction industry, particularly in structural applications. They are essential for aligning and supporting heavy loads, contributing to the stability and safety of buildings and infrastructure. Common types used in construction include edge-bonded and peel-away shims, known for their precision and adaptability.

<text>Floyd Delafield Crosby, ASC (December 12, 1899September 30, 1985) was an American cinematographer. He won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1931 for &quot;&quot;, his debut film, before going on to shoot over 120 productions in a career spanning over 40 years. Crosby worked with such directors as Fred Zinnemann. Beginning in the 1950&#x27;s, he was the regular cinematographer for Roger Corman, totaling 21 films together.

Crosby was also the father of singer-songwriter David Crosby.
== Early life ==

Floyd Delafield Crosby was born and raised in West Philadelphia, the son of Julia Floyd () and Frederick Van Schoonhoven Crosby. Through his maternal grandmother, he was descended from the prominent Van Rensselaer family. His maternal grandfather was Dr.Francis Delafield. His maternal uncle was Edward Henry Delafield (18801955).

Crosby worked at the New York Stock Exchange, before enrolling in the New York Institute of Photography.

== Career ==
In 1927, he was hired by marine biologist William Beebe as a cameraman for his expedition to Haiti. The expedition would establish Crosby as a top documentary cameraman, befriending Robert J. Flaherty. In 1929, Flaherty hired Crosby to shoot the ethnographic film &quot;&quot;, directed by F. W. Murnau. It was Crosby&#x27;s first photography credit on a feature film, and earned him Best Cinematography at the 4th Academy Awards. 

Crosby subsequently filmed the Bedaux expedition in 1934, and shot other documentaries for the likes of Pare Lorentz and Joris Ivens. He served as a cinematographer for the U.S. Army Air Corps film wing, and made flight training films in World War II. He left the Air Corps in 1946. His disinterest in studio politics dissuaded him from working on traditional feature films, and he remained a somewhat fringe figure until 1951, when Robert Rossen hired him to shoot &quot;The Brave Bulls&quot;. The following year, he shot &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) for director Fred Zinnemann, which went on to win four Academy Awards. Crosby won a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography (Black-and-White). 

In the following years, Crosby worked primarily with B-movie director Roger Corman. Beginning with &quot;Five Guns West&quot; (1955), the two worked on a total of 21 films between 1955 and 1967. Crosby also shot many other films for Corman&#x27;s American International Pictures. Some sources claimed Crosby was relegated to working on B-movies because he had been blacklisted, though Corman denied this, stating Crosby&#x27;s simply disliked traditional studio politics. 

In 1973, he participated in an oral history sponsored by the American Film Institute, part of which dealt with his work on &quot;Tabu: A Story of the South Seas&quot;. 

== Personal life ==

On December 11, 1930, he married Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead. She was the daughter of John Brinton Whitehead. Together, they had two children:
* Ethan Crosby (1937–1997), a reclusive singer-songwriter
* David Crosby (1941–2023), a member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young

Crosby divorced in 1960 and married Betty Cormack Andrews in the same year. He retired in 1972 to Ojai, California. 

=== Death ===
Crosby died in Ojai at the age of 85, in 1985.

<text>Vyacheslav Ivanovich Zof (Russian: Вячеслав Иванович Зоф; 6 January 1890 – 20 June 1937) was a Soviet military figure and statesman of Czech descent.

== Biography ==
Zof joined the revolutionary movement in 1910. Three years later he became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). During World War I, Zof worked as a fitter at an arms factory in Sestroretsk, where he was in charge of the Bolshevist underground. After the February Revolution in 1917, Zof led the Bolsheviks&#x27; organization in Sestroretsk and was a deputy of the Petrograd Soviet.

In July 1917, he prepared fake identity papers for Vladimir Lenin and organized his move from Petrograd to Razliv at the request of the RSDLP Central Committee. Zof would then establish contact between Lenin and the Central Committee.

In 1918–1919, he was appointed brigade and division commissar and supplies manager for the 3rd Army of the Eastern Front. In 1919–1920, Zof was a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Baltic Fleet and a member of the Petrograd defense committee. In 1921–1924, he held a post of a commissar at the office of the commander-in-chief of the naval forces of the Republic. Between December 1924 and 1926, Zof was the commander of the naval forces and member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR. In 1927–1929, he headed the Sovtorgflot (Soviet Commercial Fleet) office. In 1930–1931, Zof was a deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Railroad Transportation. In 1931, he was appointed first deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Water Transportation.

Later Zof fell into disgrace and was appointed director of the &quot;Kompresor&quot; factory in Moscow. In 1937, he was arrested and sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on June 19 on accounts of being involved in an &quot;anti-Soviet terrorist organisation&quot;. Zof was executed the next day.

He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.

<text>The USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC, or, canonically, USENIX) is a conference of computing researchers sponsored by the USENIX association. The conference includes computing tutorials, and a single track technical session for presenting refereed research papers, SIG meetings, and BoFs.

There have been several notable announcements and talks at USENIX. In 1995, James Gosling announced &quot;Oak&quot;, which was to become the Java Programming Language. John Ousterhout first presented TCL here, and Usenet was announced here.

It is considered one of the most prestigious venues for computer systems research and has an &#x27;A&#x27; rating from the Australian CORE Conference Ranking system.

From 2021 onward, this is co-located with another premier conference, USENIX OSDI.

<text>Timothy John Gane (born 12 July 1964) is an English songwriter and guitarist who co-founded Stereolab with his then-partner Lætitia Sadier.

==Biography==
Gane was born in Ilford, Essex, and began his musical career experimenting with harsh noise in the early 1980s, under the alias Unkommunitim, releasing self-financed cassettes on Black Dwarf Wreckordings along with fellow Unkommuniti members Kallous Boys and other noise projects.

He was a key member of McCarthy from 1985 until their breakup in 1990.

===Stereolab===
Gane later formed Stereolab with Lætitia Sadier. For the first incarnation of the band, they enlisted ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean, drummer Joe Dilworth and Gina Morris on backing vocals. In 1993, the band were signed to the American major-label Elektra and were released from their recording contract in 2004. In 2009, Stereolab announced their hiatus. Stereolab reunited for a tour in 2019 to support a series of vinyl reissues.

Turn On, Gane&#x27;s side project with Sean O&#x27;Hagan, who Gane worked with in Stereolab, released their self-titled debut in 1997.

===Cavern of Anti-Matter===
In 2013, he released &quot;Blood-Drums&quot; under the moniker &quot;Cavern of Anti-Matter&quot;, a band formed together with Holger Zapf and Dilworth. It was followed by the 2016 album &quot;Void Beats / Invocation Trex&quot; on Duophonic Records. It featured contributions by Bradford Cox and Peter Kember and Jan St. Werner. Live the band was reduced to a duo. In January 2017, &quot;Blood Drums&quot; was re-released through Duophonic.

In 2014, Gane compiled the tracks for Sky Records &quot;Kollektion 1&quot;, a collection of tracks from the German electronic-rock label, issued by Bureau B. In 2016, he presented FACT mix 544 for Fact Magazine.

Cavern of Anti-Matter provided the original soundtrack for the 2018 British horror comedy film &quot;In Fabric&quot;.

<doc id="1155539" wikidata="Q489313" url="?curid=1155539" title="Walibi Belgium">
<text>Walibi Belgium is a 64-hectare (158.15 acres) theme park located in Wavre, Walloon Brabant, Wallonia, Belgium, close to the city of Brussels. The park complex consists of the titular theme park and the Aqualibi indoor water park that is located next door. It is one of the largest theme parks in Belgium; with roughly 1.45 million visitors attending in 2018. 

Initially opened by entrepreneur Eddy Meeùs in 1975, Walibi expanded into a chain of six amusement parks located across Belgium, France, and Holland. The park spent a brief period in the 2000s under the Six Flags brand following Walibi&#x27;s sale to the American-based theme park operator, but was reverted after being sold to Palamon Capital Partners and eventually its current owners Compagnie des Alpes.

==History==
The park originally opened on 26 July 1975 by entrepreneur Eddy Meeùs. The park&#x27;s name; &quot;Walibi&quot;, is aabbreviated play-on-words of three local districts within the province of Walloon Brabant near where the park sits - Wavre, Limal, and Bierges. A Wallaby (a macropod cousin of the kangaroo) was used as the mascot of the park to fit in with its name. The park opened with children&#x27;s attractions that were themed to the Belgian comic franchise Tintin, including and , of which the park held the license until the end of 1995. The park also opened with a water skiing section which remained until 1994.

An indoor water park - Aqualibi, opened next door to the park in 1987.

===Six Flags Belgium===
In December 1997, with an interest to enter the European market and to compete with rival Disneyland Paris, the US-based Premier Parks (later Six Flags) announced that they would purchase a controlling stake in the Walibi Group from Eddy Meeùs. For 1998, the park opened up a new themed area based on the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; franchise entitled &quot;Lucky Luke City&quot; which contained the world&#x27;s largest drop tower attraction; entitled &quot;Dalton Terror&quot;.. The addition of the area marked the last new addition to the park under Meeùs&#x27; control. For 1999, Premier added three new attractions to the park intending to make it the flagship of Six Flags&#x27; European operations.

Shortly after Premier rebranded under the Six Flags name, plans were put into place for the park potentially being rebranded under the Six Flags umbrella. On December 29, 2000, Six Flags officially announced that the park would be renamed as Six Flags Belgium. with the park&#x27;s official renaming was put into place in January. The relaunch of the park would coincide with over $30 million worth of investments and changes with the most major being the addition of Warner Bros. properties into the park, including attractions based on &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and DC Comics characters; while Walibi would be replaced with Bugs Bunny as the park&#x27;s new mascot. Despite the Americanisation of the park, the Belgian-based &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; would remain. The rebranding of the park was put in place after sister park Walibi Flevo&#x27;s rebranding as Six Flags Holland led to a heavy boost in attendance. The park officially reopened under its new name on 28 April, after a delay from its originally intended opening of 8 April. On 24 November 2001, Eddy Meeùs passed away at the age of 76.

===StarParks/Grévin &amp; Cie===
Following financial difficulties and other issues, Six Flags announced the sale of their European Parks division to an undisclosed buyer on 15 March 2004. The purchaser was later revealed to be the London-based Palamon Capital Partners, who rebranded the chain as StarParks. The Warner Bros. license was not included in the sale. On April 16, Palamon announced that the park would rebrand back under the Walibi name for the 2005 season, following a fan-cast polling vote. At the end of the park&#x27;s 2004 season on 7 November, it was announced that Six Flags Belgium would become Walibi Belgium upon the start of the park&#x27;s 2005 season on 26 March, while Walibi would return as the park&#x27;s mascot (although he had a semi-return at Aqualibi near the end of 2003(); having been on a four year &quot;world tour&quot; and being handed back the keys to the park from Bugs Bunny. A newly introduced group of characters (deemed his &quot;world tour&quot; friends) and a female counterpart named Walibelle were also introduced as part of the park&#x27;s new storyline. These characters would appear in Walibi Folies, which would rebrand from Bugs Bunny Land, while the 3D cinema would replace the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; show with &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D&quot;. Walibi&#x27;s promotions director Dominique Fallon had proclaimed that former owner Eddy Meeùs had cited the Six Flags rebranding as a &quot;mistake&quot;.

In March 2006, Palamon Capital Partners sold the Walibi chain, including Walibi Belgium, to Grévin &amp; Cie, a subsidiary of Compagnie des Alpes. This was done for Palamon to focus its operations solely on sister park Movie Park Germany.

In 2017, the park announced a 100 million euro make-over, featuring a re-theme of 75% of the park and adding several new rides. One of them being an Intamin megacoaster.

From 2012 to 2014, the Aqualibi waterpark underwent a major refurbishment, costing €11 million (US$16 million).

In March 2014, the park&#x27;s license for &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; was not renewed.

=== Summer Nights ===
During 5 Saturdays in a row in July and August, Walibi Belgium has their late night openings. During those nights, the park remains open until 11:00 p.m. and offers additional entertainment. Each night ends with a firework show around the lake, sometimes with a themed show.

=== Halloween ===
One of the events the park is known for is Halloween, traditionally during the last weekends of October and autumn holiday in Belgium. During Halloween, Walibi Belgium transforms into hell on earth with scary entertainment and other festivities. The park started celebrating Halloween in 2000 on a small scale, leading it to be one of the biggest Halloween events in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since 2008, Walibi Belgium introduced a storyline around the event which is still running in 2013. Every year, the story has an open ending, making visitors curious for the following year. This happens during a finale show, including special effects, music and actors. The park also creates scare-zones, zones in the park that get a Halloween theme. The park is also known for their number of haunted houses during Halloween. For 2012 and 2013, guests were welcomed in 6 different haunted houses spread over the park. The haunted houses the park offers are nowadays known for their often strange locations and aggressive and violent actors.

For 4 to 5 days, the park also has Halloween nights, with the park staying open until 9 p.m. nightly.

Born in Barcelona, Alfau emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of fourteen. He lived in the United States for the remainder of his life. Alfau earned a living as a translator. His sparse creation of fictional and poetic output remained obscure throughout most of his lifetime.

Alfau wrote two novels in English: &quot;Locos: A Comedy of Gestures&quot; and &quot;Chromos.&quot; &quot;Locos&quot; — a metafictive collection of related short stories set in Toledo and Madrid, involving several characters that defy the wishes of the author, write their own stories, and even assume each other&#x27;s roles — was published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1936. The novel, for which Alfau was paid $250, received some critical acclaim, but little popular attention. The novel was republished in 1987 after Steven Moore, then an editor for the small publisher Dalkey Archive Press, found the book at a barn sale in Massachusetts, read it, and contacted Alfau after a friend had found his telephone number in the Manhattan phone book. The novel&#x27;s second edition was modestly successful, but Alfau refused payment, instructing the publisher to use the earnings from &quot;Locos&quot; to fund some other unpublished work. When Moore asked if he had written any other books, Alfau produced the manuscript for &quot;Chromos&quot;, which had been resting in a drawer since 1948. A comic story of Spanish immigrants to the United States contending with their two cultures, &quot;Chromos&quot; went on to be nominated for the National Book Award in 1990.

Alfau also wrote a book of poetry in Spanish, &quot;Sentimental Songs&quot; (&quot;La poesía cursi&quot;), written between 1923 and 1987 and published in a bilingual edition in 1992; and a book of children&#x27;s stories, &quot;Old Tales from Spain&quot;, published in 1929.

&quot;Locos&quot;, &quot;Chromos&quot; and &quot;Old Tales from Spain&quot; were translated into Spanish and published in Spain during the 1990s.

Alfau&#x27;s last years were spent in an octogenarian nursing home in New York, thanks to an indigent pension granted by the city council. Felipe Alfau died in New York in 1999.

Dawn Powell knew him in the late 1930s and described him thus in her diaries:

Felipe Alfau, brilliant, dazzling mind, witty, Jesuitical, a mental performance similar only to Cummings, but a scholar—erudite, fascinating, above all a romantic about his Spain, fiercely patriotic, a figure out of a medieval romance, a lover of Toledo, of old Spain, valuable surely to his country—talked so brilliantly of Totalitarianism that is based on human weakness, human error, human conduct, that it almost convinced me.

<text>Hella is an American math rock band from Sacramento, California. The primary members of the band are Spencer Seim on electric guitar and Zach Hill on drums. The band expanded their live band by adding Dan Elkan on vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler and synthesizer and Jonathan Hischke on synth bass guitar for their 2005 tour. In 2006 they reformed as a five-piece line-up including Seim, Hill, Carson McWhirter (of The Advantage), Aaron Ross &amp; Josh Hill. In 2009, the band was reduced back to core members Hill and Seim.

AllMusic called Hella &quot;one of the most prolific acts on the American noise-rock scene&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
As teenagers Spencer Seim and Zach Hill were both members of the Northern California band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and Primus-esque sound. Zach Hill described Legs on Earth in an interview as pop music but in the way Devo and Talking Heads were considered pop. They released one album in 1999 called &quot;Lasers &amp; Saviors&quot; on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In April 2000 they went on hiatus and later broke up. Imsdahl was later in the band Grandstream (formerly known as Little California), and was previously in the band Eraserhead, while Josh Hill went on to be in the band Playing to the Grandstand. Hill and Seim decided they wanted to continue playing together and pursue a less mainstream sound. According to Hill, they didn&#x27;t always intend to remain a duo, though: &quot;[We] had intentions to start a band that was like… kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people. But, we couldn&#x27;t find the other people so we decided to do it just with the two of us.&quot; Their name is simply a reference to the slang word &quot;&quot; that was common throughout Northern California.

Hella&#x27;s earliest recording was the self-released &quot;Leather Diamond&quot; EP, hand-assembled in a nondescript cardboard sleeve and sold at some of their first shows.

On March 19, 2002, they debuted proper with the full-length &quot;Hold Your Horse Is&quot; LP on 5 Rue Christine (a subsidiary of Olympia, Washington-based Kill Rock Stars). The &quot;Falam Dynasty&quot; 7-inch was also released that year.

===2003—present===
After the release of &quot;Hold Your Horse Is&quot;, 2003 saw Hella begin to deviate from the basic framework in the studio, although their live sound remained largely unchanged. Released on June 17 of that year, Hella&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Ain&#x27;t Shit But Good People&quot; EP (originally a vinyl only release) featured many firsts for the band. An earlier recorded (&quot;Leather Diamond&quot;) version of a song from their first LP, &quot;Republic of Rough And Ready&quot;, became their first widely released song to feature vocals (provided by friend of the band Dan Elkan). A version of &quot;1-800-Ghost-Dance&quot; with vocals by Elkan was available as a downloadable mp3 on the band&#x27;s website in late 2002. The &quot;Bitches&quot; EP also found Hella using bass guitar, synthesizer, and drum machine for the first time. &quot;Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass&quot;, also an EP, was released on August 26 and featured the use of synth, sampler, and drum machine and an apparent influence from 8-bit video game music, first hinted at on the opening track of &quot;Hold Your Horse Is&quot;, &quot;The D. Elkan&quot;. Hella rounded out the year with a split live double CD with San Francisco, California-based band Dilute.

Hella released their second full-length LP in 2004, &quot;The Devil Isn&#x27;t Red&quot;. Other releases for the year included a split 7-inch (with Four Tet) and a limited edition, Japan-only release of the three-song &quot;Acoustics&quot; EP.

For their 2005 release, Hella again experimented with their sound in the studio. &quot;Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard&quot;, released through Suicide Squeeze Records, is a double-solo album, with Zach Hill and Seim each recording a whole disc&#x27;s worth of material independent of each other. Hill&#x27;s disc, &quot;Church Gone Wild&quot;, is a 56-minute noise piece which featured Zach doing all the vocals and instruments, save for a few guest appearances; while Seim&#x27;s disc, &quot;Chirpin Hard&quot;, again experiments with the fusion of 8-bit Nintendo music with punk and math rock. Hella also expanded their live band to a quartet in 2005, adding Dan Elkan on vocals, rhythm guitar, and synthesizer, and Jonathan Hischke on bass guitar in order to play songs from &quot;Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass&quot; and &quot;Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard&quot; live, in most cases for the first time. This line-up toured the US in support of Out Hud in Spring, System of a Down, The Mars Volta, Les Claypool, and Dillinger Escape Plan in the fall as well as numerous headlining dates in the U.S. as well as visits to Japan, Spain and the UK. The show from October 8 at Arco &amp; Oakland Arenas was documented by R.T. Thomas and self-released in July 2007 on DVD.

A DVD/CD EP release titled &quot;Concentration Face/Homeboy&quot; was released on November 8, 2005, on 5RC Records. The DVD features almost 3 hours of footage from their 2004 Japan tour, mostly consisting of performances from the first two albums.

In 2006, Hella consisted of Spencer Seim, Zach Hill, Hill&#x27;s cousin Josh (who also played in Legs on Earth), Seim&#x27;s Advantage bandmate Carson McWhirter, and Aaron Ross. The first release from this line-up, entitled &quot;There&#x27;s No 666 in Outer Space&quot;, was released on January 30, 2007, on Ipecac Recordings. This album was released in 2008 as a double 180g vinyl on Black Diamond Records with new artwork by Mayka Finkelstein-Amrami.

As of August 2008, In an interview with Exclaim Magazine regarding his solo effort, Zach stated that &quot;Hella is a real grey area in general right now&quot;. The future of the band seemed to be up in the air.

On Thursday, March 12, 2009, a blog post on Hella&#x27;s MySpace page revealed that Hella once again consisted of only core members Hill and Seim, and that the band was working on writing and recording a new album, due to be finished later that year. It also revealed that an international tour may have been in the works.

On September 4, 2010, Hella announced they had eight tracks ready for their new album.

As of 2011, Hella is signed to Sargent House, who released their most recent album, &quot;Tripper&quot;, on August 30, 2011.

On March 19, 2022, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of “Hold Your Horse Is,” the band announced the album&#x27;s vinyl reissue in 2022 along with the release of never-before seen or heard Hella media.

On July 24, 2023, the deluxe reissue of &quot;Hold Your Horse Is&quot; was revealed, sporting different variations of colored vinyl, and a bonus 7&quot;. Pitchfork gave the album an 8.3 as &quot;Best New Reissue&quot;, more than 21 years after the original release of the album. 

==Side projects==
In addition to their work in Hella, Seim and Zach Hill have also recorded with a number of side projects.

Seim plays drums in NES theme music cover band The Advantage (a reference to the NES Advantage controller), notable for using only guitar, bass guitar, and drums to replicate the 8-bit programmed music of the games. The genre has been called Nintendocore and The Advantage are credited with pioneering it. Seim has also released a solo album under the moniker sBACH. Recently Seim, playing drums, has formed Solos with guitarist and vocalist Aaron Ross (formerly of Hella). Their debut album &quot;Beast of Both Worlds&quot; was released on Sept 11 2012 on Joyful Noise records.

Hill has recorded albums with Marnie Stern, Tough Guy Fantasy/Arctic Boys, Flössin, Crime in Choir, Nervous Cop (with drummer Greg Saunier of Deerhoof and harpist Joanna Newsom), Damsel (with guitarist Nels Cline), Friend/Enemy (with Tim Kinsella, Sam Zurick, Todd Mattei, Jim Becker, Graeme Gibson, Caryn Culp, Emma Grace Lansangan, Nick Marci, Chris Powell, Azita Youssefi), Zach Hill and the Holy Smokes (whose first release was accompanied by a 138-page book written and illustrated by Hill), as well as playing drums for Chino Moreno&#x27;s band Team Sleep, The Ladies, Kenseth Thibideau and Marty Anderson&#x27;s band Howard Hello and Jeordie White and Chris Goss&#x27;s band Goon Moon. More recently, Hill has teamed up with Mick Barr from Octis and Orthrelm and together have released the LPs &quot;Shred Earthship&quot; on 5 Rue Christine and &quot;Volume 2&quot; on the Austrian label Rock Is Hell. &quot;Volume 2&quot; consists of the two longest tracks from the &quot;Shred Earthship&quot; sessions. Hill&#x27;s best known project outside of Hella now is perhaps experimental hip hop outfit Death Grips, who have gone on to achieve a cult following in their own right and widespread critical acclaim.

Both Hill and Hischke are members of El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez with Juan Alderete, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López, the first of three records produced by the group is &quot;Cryptomnesia&quot;, which was released on May 5, 2009.

In 2008, Hischke formed the band Dot Hacker along with Josh Klinghoffer.

<text>Johann Ludwig (Louis) Gerard Krefft (17 February 1830 – 18 February 1881), was an Australian artist, draughtsman, scientist, and natural historian who served as the curator of the Australian Museum for 13 years (1861–1874). He was one of Australia&#x27;s first and most influential palaeontologists and zoologists, &quot;some of [whose] observations on animals have not been surpassed and can no longer be equalled because of the spread of settlement (Rutledge &amp; Whitley, 1974).

He is also noted as an ichthyologist for his scientific description of the Queensland lungfish (now recognized as a classic example of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;living fossils&quot;); and, in addition to his numerous scientific papers and his extensive series of weekly newspaper articles on natural history, his publications include &quot;The Snakes of Australia&quot; (1869), &quot;Guide to the Australian Fossil Remains in the Australian Museum&quot; (1870f), &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot; (1871f), &quot;On Australian Entozoa&quot; (1872a), and &quot;Catalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Australian Museum&quot; (1873a).

Krefft was one of the very few Australian scientists in the 1860s and 1870s to support Darwin&#x27;s position on the origin of species by means of natural selection. According to Macdonald, et al. (2007), he was one of the first to warn of the devastating effects of the invasive species (sheep, cats, etc.) on native species. Also, along with several significant others such as Charles Darwin, during his 1836 visit to the Blue Mountains, Edward Wilson, the proprietor of the Melbourne &quot;Argus&quot;, and George Bennett, one of the trustees of the Australian Museum Krefft expressed considerable concern in relation to the effects of the expanding European settlement upon the indigenous population.
::Gerard Krefft is a significant figure in the history of nineteenth century Australian science. He is celebrated not only for his zoological work but as a man who was prepared to challenge individuals on points of scientific fact regardless of their position in Sydney society or metropolitan science. He is also remembered as one who could be abrasive and incautious in delicate political situations and a man whose career and life ultimately ended in tragedy. The dramatic end of Krefft&#x27;s career in 1874 where he was stripped of his position as Australian Museum curator, physically removed from the Museum and his character assassinated often overshadows his early career and his development as a scientist.Stephens (2013), p. 187.

== Family ==

Krefft was born on 17 February 1830 in the Duchy of Brunswick (now part of Germany), the son of William Krefft, a confectioner, and his wife Johanna (&quot;née&quot; Bischhoff).

=== Education ===
He was educated at St Martin&#x27;s College in Braunschweig (i.e., ) from 1834 to 1845. As a youth, he was interested in art, especially painting animals, and wanted to go on to a formal study of painting; however, after his schooling, his family found employment for him at a mercantile firm in Halberstadt.

=== Marriage ===
He married Annie McPhail, later (1893) Mrs. Robert Macintosh, on 6 February 1869. According to Nancarrow (2007, p. 5), Annie McPhail was the Australian-born daughter of Scottish bounty immigrants, who had arrived in Australia in 1837 to work for George Bowman, and she was five months pregnant at the time of her marriage to Krefft.

They had four children, only two of whom survived their infancy: 
Rudolph Gerard Krefft (1869–1951), and Herman Gerard Krefft (1879–1911). A fifth child, an unnamed stillborn daughter, was delivered on 2 July 1874.

=== German heritage ===
As a German speaker, Krefft belonged to the largest non-English-speaking group in Australia in the 1800s; and, as such, Krefft was one of a number of influential German-speaking scientists who, according to Barrett, et al. (2018, p. 2) brought their &quot;epistemic traditions&quot; to Australia, and not only became &quot;deeply entangled with the Australian colonial project&quot;, but also were &quot;intricately involved in imagining, knowing and shaping colonial Australia&quot;.

Moreover, in relation to Krefft (the scientist), and his wider disciplinary allegiances, and his limited deference to the supposed authority of the established British scientific elite, unlike the Anglo-Australian trustees of the Australian Museum and &quot;like many [of the German] scientists working in Australia, England was never &quot;home&quot; for Krefft as it was for the majority of colonists&quot; and, typically, England did not &quot;provid[e] the sole intellectual influence for [Krefft&#x27;s] investigations&quot; (Davidson, 2017, p. 81).

== &quot;Natural history&quot; ==

Given Vallance&#x27;s tripartite division (1978) of nineteenth century Australian science i.e., the &quot;proto-scientific period&quot; (1788–1839), the &quot;pioneer-scientific period&quot; (1840–1874), and the &quot;classic science period&quot; (1875-) Krefft&#x27;s influential Australian career was firmly centred in the pioneer-scientific period. Consequently, and in order to avoid the prochronistic mistake of viewing the past through the eyes of the present, and given,
* that the Australian Museum (established in 1827) is the fifth oldest museum of natural history in the world,
* the need to identify the Australian Museum&#x27;s orientation during Krefft&#x27;s tenure,
* the need to identify Krefft&#x27;s particular domains of interest (and influence) as a scientist,
* the on-going significance of Krefft&#x27;s (more than 180) &quot;Natural History&quot; articles published in the &quot;Sydney Mail&quot; from March 1871 to June 1875, and
* that 19th. century &quot;natural&quot; history was concerned with the study of nature; and, from this, it was directly involved with the evidence obtained from the direct observation of nature (however ambiguously &quot;nature&quot; might be described),
* that, in 1822 (pp. iii-iv) Friedrich Mohs drew attention to the inappropriateness of the label &quot;natural history&quot;, on the grounds that it &quot;does not express the essential properties of the science to which it is applied&quot;, and
* that, in 1837, prompted by Mohs&#x27; remarks, William Whewell, the mineralogist, scholar and, later, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (from 1841 to 1866), who, in his time, was &quot;recognized as the leading authority on new [terminological] coinages&quot; as part of his ground-breaking work in relation to the issues of terminology and classification within the sciences, and extending the meaning of the (recently introduced) English term palæontology suggested the alternative notion of &quot;palætiological sciences&quot; to denote &quot;those researches in which the object is, to ascend from the present state of things to a more ancient condition, from which the present is derived by intelligible causes&quot; (Whewell, 1837, p. 481).
it is important to note that the widely used &quot;umbrella&quot; terms of &quot;natural history&quot; and &quot;natural historian&quot; (or &quot;naturalist&quot;) were generally understood (and variously applied) in the mid-1800s to identify the collective endeavours of an extremely wide range of diverse enterprises that are, now, separately identified as, at least, the disciplines of anthropology, astronomy, biology, botany, ecology, entomology, ethnology, geology, herpetology, ichthyology, mammalogy, mineralogy, mycology, ornithology, palaeontology, and zoology.

== &quot;Darwinian doctrine&quot; and the consequent &quot;Darwinian controversy&quot; ==
::In a landmark book entitled &quot;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&quot;, Darwin argued against the conventional notion that God had supernaturally created the original types of plants and animals [viz., &#x27;the immutability of species&#x27;] and in favor of the idea that they had evolved naturally over long periods of time primarily, though not exclusively, by means of random variation and natural selection.Numbers &amp; Stenhouse (1999), p. 1.

Krefft&#x27;s professional career, his museum curatorship, his interactions with the Anglo-Australian trustees of the Australian Museum, and his professional endeavours to disseminate the latest scientific understandings to the people of New South Wales in the mid-1800s coincided with an entirely new awareness of the world, derived from the abundance of ongoing scientific advances, technological innovations, geological discoveries, and colonial explorations, and the emerging rational skepticism, expressed by Bishop John Colenso (Colenso, 1862, 1865, 1971, 1873, 1879) and others, about the objective veracity of specific Christian scriptures (e.g., Noah&#x27;s Ark, the Deluge, the Crossing of the Red Sea, the Exodus, etc.), along with the concomitant challenges to the heretofore accepted theology, tenets of faith, and established religious practices. 

The controversy over Colenso&#x27;s challenges to Biblical authority, accepted authorship, and historical accuracy continued in Australia; e.g., on 7 July 1873, the Melbourne-based Jesuit, Joseph O&#x27;Malley, author of &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark Vindicated and Explained: A Reply to Dr. Colenso&#x27;s Difficulties&quot; (1871) (which included O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary Plan of the [1080 stalls in the] Ark&quot;), visited Sydney and lectured on &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, delivering the standard Roman Catholic position on Noah&#x27;s Ark and the Deluge, and attempting to explain away many of Colenso&#x27;s challenges. The lecture, chaired by the devout Irish Catholic layman Justice Peter Faucett, Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales who would later (in 1875) express the judicial opinion that Krefft&#x27;s dismissal from his Museum curatorship was justified was well attended.

===Evolution===

Darwin was not the first to speak of &quot;evolution&quot;; and it is important to note that Darwin, himself, did not use the term &quot;evolution&quot; until the sixth (1872) edition of his &quot;Origin&quot; (in its first five editions Darwin spoke of &quot;descent through modification&quot;). Robert Chambers, in his popular works, &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; (1844/1884) and &quot;Explanations&quot; (1845), had already made the notion of &quot;evolution&quot; a matter of public discussion. Also, there were the two earlier (anonymous) articles recently attributed (see: Tanghe &amp; Kestemont, 2018) to Robert Jameson, the Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh and, also, the Journal&#x27;s editor &quot;Observations on the Nature and Importance of Geology&quot; (Anon, 1826; esp. pp. 297–299) and &quot;Of the Changes which Life has experienced on the Globe&quot; (Anon, 1827), that had been published in the &quot;Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal&quot; at the time that Darwin was studying medicine at Edinburgh University. Jameson&#x27;s articles were even more influential in the case of Darwin, given the fact that during the 1826/1827 academic year, Darwin had, as an extracurricular study, &quot;assiduously&quot; attended Jameson&#x27;s popular natural history lectures at Edinburgh University, which involved &quot;lectures five days a week for five months&quot; (Secord, 1991, pp. 134–135), at least one of which was entitled &quot;On the Origins of the Animal Species&quot; (Tanghe &amp; Kestemont, 2018, p. 586).

=== Natural selection ===
::Fertilized by his [1839] &quot;Beagle&quot; journal from his four years as a travelling naturalist and his subsequent experiments and research, &quot;The Origin&quot; was stocked with new biological data drawn from sources across the globe, its wide compass offering a detailed proposal for the progressive development of species and a positivist biological framework for man&#x27;s understanding of the natural world.Moyal &amp; Marks, 2019, p. 5.
In a paper read to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 written separately from, but presented jointly with, that of Alfred Russel Wallace (i.e., Darwin &amp; Wallace, 1858) that was firmly based upon the foundations of the extensive and varied evidence provided by his comprehensive in-the-field observations over two decades, Darwin was the first to propose &quot;natural selection&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;artificial selection&quot; of livestock- or plant-breeders) thereby &quot;[substituting] a natural for a supernatural explanation of the material organic universe&quot; (Abbott, 1912, p. 18) as the process responsible for the diversity of life on Earth.

Along with the Sydney botanist, Robert D. FitzGerald, and the Melbourne economist, Professor William Edward Hearn, Krefft was one of the very few Australian scientists in the 1860s and 1870s who supported Darwin&#x27;s position on the origin of species by means of natural selection.

=== Ellegård&#x27;s five &quot;positions&quot; held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy ===

::What appears so remarkable to [those in] a later age is that in the mid-nineteenth century scientists could look upon a supernatural explanation as a valid alternative to a scientific one.Ellegård (1990), p. 15.
::The law of succession [as demonstrated by The Wellington Caves&#x27; &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils], once firmly established, provided a powerful argument in favour of evolution. If one adopts the theory that new species develop from preexisting ones by a process of descent with modification, then it is absolutely necessary that there be a continuity between existing species and recently extinct species. Moreover, the opposing theories of the anti-evolutionists failed to explain this continuity.Dugan (1980), p. 270.

Alvar Ellegård&#x27;s extensive (1958) survey of the coverage of the &quot;Darwinian doctrine&quot; in the U.K. press between 1859 and 1872 distinguished three aspects &quot;first, the Evolution idea in its general application to the whole of the organic world; second, the Natural Selection theory; and third, [the] theory of Man&#x27;s descent from the lower animals&quot; (Ellegård, 1990, p. 24) and identified five ideological &quot;positions&quot; taken (or ideological &quot;attitudes&quot; displayed) by individual participants over that decade and a half, which were determined, to a considerable extent, not only by their levels of education, but also by their particular politico-social, philosophical, and/or religious orientation.

These five positions (collectively) reflected a simple series, which &quot;indicate[d] an increasing degree of favourableness towards Darwin&#x27;s theory, from total rejection to complete acceptance&quot; (p. 30); and, as one moved from lower (A) to higher (E) along Ellegård&#x27;s series, &quot;less and less of the processes going into the formation of species were recognized [by those holding that position] as supernatural, or outside the range of ordinary scientific explanation ... [and, therefore] anybody accepting a position with a higher [level] accepted &quot;ipso facto&quot; all the scientific explanation already granted by those holding a lower position&quot; (p. 31):
* (A): &quot;Absolute Creation&quot; (p. 30): &quot;the fundamentalist religious position, according to which each species arose as a distinct and instantaneous creation, in the literal and naïve sense of the word&quot;;
* (B): &quot;Progressive Creation&quot; (p. 30): &quot;where species developed mysteriously from the simplest organic form&quot;;
* (C): &quot;Derivation&quot; (p. 30): &quot;which recognised the principle of descent in progressive evolution but allowed that this mechanism was only one of the secondary processes which the Creator employed&quot;;
* (D): &quot;Directed Selection&quot; (p. 31): &quot;which admitted the efficacy of Natural Selection for a considerable number of specific differentiations, but relied on a teleological explanation as an indispensable part of the explanation of the organic world&quot;; and
* (E): &quot;Natural Selection&quot; (p. 31): &quot;the scientific, non-teleological, non-supernatural explanation of the evolution of the whole organic world&quot;.

According to Ellegård&#x27;s survey (p. 32), until 1863, the majority of British scientists belonged to either (A) or (B); but, by 1873, the majority had moved to either (C) or (D), with a small number of them going on to position (E).

However, things were considerably different in Australia. Setting aside disciplinary &quot;outliers&quot; such as FitzGerald, Hearn, and Krefft (each of whom held position (E)) and ignoring the (peripheral) fact that Charles Darwin was elected as an honorary member of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1879, and that pro-Darwinians, the natural historian, Thomas Huxley, and the botanist, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, were awarded the Society&#x27;s prestigious Clarke Medal in 1880 and 1885 respectively it was not really until the late 1890s, due to the influence of the academic appointments of William Aitcheson Haswell to the University of Sydney, Baldwin Spencer to the University of Melbourne, Ralph Tate to the University of Adelaide, and James Thomas Wilson to the University of Sydney, etc., and the administrative/curatorial appointments of Robert Etheridge to the Australian Museum in Sydney, Baldwin Spencer to the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne, and Herbert Scott to the Queen Victoria Museum in Launceston, etc., that the majority of Australian scientists began to move away from (A) or (B), and that &quot;the contributions of Darwin and his successors [could begin to] seriously affect Australian thinking and bring it into the mainstream of scientific thought&quot; (Mozley, p. 430).

== Artist ==

In order to avoid the military draft, Krefft moved to New York City in 1850, where he was employed as a clerk and a draughtsman, and was mainly concerned with producing depictions of sea views and shipping. Whilst in New York, he encountered the work of John James Audubon at the New York Mercantile Library. Having been granted permission to do so, Krefft made copies of some of the Audubon plates, which he then sold to raise his fare to Australia. Krefft arrived in Melbourne, from New York, on 15 October 1852, on the &quot;Revenue&quot;, and worked in the Victorian goldfields &quot;with much success&quot; for some five years. Krefft contributed examples of his drawings to the &quot;Victorian Industrial Society&#x27;s&quot; Exhibition, in Melbourne, in February 1858.

== Victoria (1852 – 1858) ==
=== Melbourne ===

Having met the mining engineer William Blandowski when he (Krefft) was making copies of Gould&#x27;s illustrations of native animals in &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot; in the Public Library of Victoria, the talented artist and draughtsman was hired, by Blandowski, &quot;on the basis of Krefft&#x27;s ability to produce detailed drawings of natural history specimens&quot;, to help sketch and collect specimens for the National Museum of Victoria on William Blandowski&#x27;s expeditions into the relatively poorly-known and semi-arid country around the confluence of the Murray River and Darling River in 1856–1857. Krefft acted as Blandowski&#x27;s amanuensis (&quot;taking dictation from Blandowski by candlelight after dinner&quot;), was responsible for the preparation of specimens, recording of all the biological material, caring for the horses and bullocks, and &quot;much of the day-to-day work around the camp, including cooking&quot; (Menkhorst, 2009, p. 65).

Blandowski was recalled to Melbourne by the Victorian Government in early August 1857, and he took all of his collected material back to Melbourne with him. Krefft then took command of the expedition until it finally returned at the end of November 1857. In 1858 Krefft was appointed to the National Museum of Victoria to catalogue the collection of specimens that he (i.e., Krefft) had brought back to Melbourne with him, which he listed under 3389 catalogue numbers.

===Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy===
Krefft&#x27;s later accounts of the expedition&#x27;s discoveries (viz., 1865a and 1865b) are not only significant in themselves, but have additional significance due to the controversies surrounding Blandowski&#x27;s sudden departure from Australia along with his collection of illustrations, documents, in-the-field notes, and specimens. Apart from Blandowski&#x27;s (1862) controversial &quot;Australien in 142 photographischen Abbildungen nach zehnjährigen Erfahrungen&quot; (&#x27;Australia in 142 Photographic Illustrations after a Decade of Experiences&#x27;), Blandowski never published anything further in relation to that expedition.

Blandowski, one of the inaugural members of the Council of the Philosophical Society of Victoria, had been appointed as the Government Zoologist in 1854 by Andrew Clarke, Surveyor General of Victoria. He also served (&quot;ex officio&quot;) as the curator of the &quot;Museum of Natural History&quot;, which had opened on 9 March 1854, was open to the public for six hours daily, and was located in the Assay Office in La Trobe Street, Melbourne.

Blandowski&#x27;s opposition to the controversial (1856) decision to (permanently, rather than temporarily) move the collection of the &quot;Museum of Natural History&quot; to the (then remote) campus of the fledgeling University of Melbourne, and deliver it over to the custody of the university&#x27;s Professor of Natural Science, Frederick McCoy, who argued (1857) that museums should exist to serve the interests of real science, rather than them &quot;being at best a place merely for [the] innocent amusement of schoolboys and idlers&quot; rather than, that is, follow the example of the British Museum and locate the collection within the premises of the (central) Melbourne Public Library, &quot;which was the first free public library in Victoria and the centrepiece of public education and improvement in the colony&quot; led to many clashes with McCoy (&quot;after his return to Melbourne [Blandowski] never reported back to duty at the museum&quot;).

There were also well-founded accusations that, &quot;[having arrived] in Adelaide in August 1857 with twenty-eight boxes containing 17,400 specimens&quot;, Blandowski had failed to deliver the material collected during his expedition upon his return to Melbourne, despite being &quot;ordered three times by the Victorian government to return his specimens and manuscripts&quot; a fact that explains, in the absence of any coherent account in English of Blandowski&#x27;s collected material, the value of Krefft&#x27;s later accounts (1865a and 1865b) of the expedition&#x27;s discoveries.

When &quot;threatened by legal action by the Victorian government over the ownership of the Expedition notebooks and illustrations&quot; (Menkhorst, 2009, p. 85), Blandowski hurriedly (and secretly) left Melbourne, on 17 March 1859 (on Captain A.A. Ballaseyers&#x27;s Prussian barque &quot;Mathilde&quot;), never to return.

== Germany ==
In 1858, following the death of his father, Krefft was obliged to return to Germany, where he travelled via England where he visited the principal museums, met up with John Gould, John Edward Gray, Albert Günther, and Richard Owen, and presented a paper (Krefft, 1858b) to the Zoological Society of London.

Krefft took many illustrations and specimens with him; however, as Allen (2006, p. 33) notes, &quot;after his return to Germany, Krefft attempted to publish his observations and drawings, but was prevented from doing so by Blandowski ... [with] Blandowski claim[ing to Krefft&#x27;s publisher] that the artwork from the expedition belonged to him, as expedition leader&quot;.

== Natural historian, museum curator and administrator ==
Krefft returned to Australia from his sojourn in Germany, with brief stays &quot;en route&quot; at the Cape of Good Hope and Adelaide, arriving in Sydney on 6 May 1860.

In June 1860, on the recommendation of Governor Sir William Denison, he was appointed Assistant Curator to Simon Rood Pittard (1821–1861) at the Australian Museum, &quot;much to the annoyance of the museum trustees, who would have preferred someone with a formal degree&quot;. Pittard, driven by his Anglo-Catholic, Puseyite views and following the practice of Charles Willson Peale at the Peale Museum, in Philadelphia adorned the walls of the Museum with inscriptions of biblical texts. Less than three weeks after Pittard&#x27;s death (in August 1861) the Trustees decided that these inscriptions were &quot;[to] be removed, and that in future &quot;no words be inscribed on the walls of the Board Room without the consent of the Trustees&quot;.&quot;

Having performed all of the duties of the position since Pittard&#x27;s death in August 1861, Krefft was eventually appointed Curator of the museum in May 1864. During his time at the Australian Museum, Krefft maintained a relationship with the Melbourne Museum, corresponding and exchanged specimens with Frederick McCoy, its Director. He also corresponded with a wide range of eminent overseas naturalists, including Charles Darwin, A.K.L.G. Günther, and Sir Richard Owen in the UK; L.J.R. Agassiz in the USA; &quot;and many learned German scientists&quot;. It is significant that Krefft&#x27;s interactions were &quot;informal communications with individuals rather than official dealings through government agencies, with the ensuing connections giving rise to further interactions with savants and museums in other centres of knowledge and power, including Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Sweden, Argentina, Canada, India and the United States, as well as Britain&quot; (Davidson, 2017, p. 8).

He was also responsible for arranging and cataloguing the Museum&#x27;s collection of donated fossils, as well as those he had discovered during his own exploratory efforts in the field, such as the two important excavations of the fossil remains of megafauna (mammals, birds, and reptiles) he conducted in 1866 (in the company of his assistants Henry Barnes and Charles Tost) and 1869 (in the company of his assistant Henry Barnes, along with William Branwhite Clarke, the Museum trustee, and Edward Deas Thomson, the Chancellor of the University of Sydney) at the Wellington Caves. According to Nancarrow (2009), the expenses for Krefft&#x27;s fossil-collecting field trip to the Wellington Caves were £200, &quot;but the value of the material collected (by exchange with other museums) was over £1,000&quot; (p 149).

=== Darwinism ===
::With the publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; ... the entire problem [of taxonomical representation] was viewed from a different perspective [from the way that &quot;the pre-Darwinian biologists interpreted a natural system&quot;]. Suddenly the reason for the existence of natural systematic categories became apparent: their members were related because of descent from a common ancestor! A taxon was now interpreted as a monophyletic array of related forms.Sokal &amp; Sneath (1963), p. 20.

Krefft&#x27;s scientific career and, in particular, his entire professional life at the Australian Museum was concurrent with (and greatly influenced by) the &quot;Darwinian controversy&quot; and its widespread ramifications; not the least of which was the central administrative (and scientific) question of which individual specimens should be exhibited (or not) in the Museum, and, if so, in what sort of order, and in which sort of way. Another concomitant and equally serious challenge to the disciplinary &quot;status quo&quot; was taxonomical: namely, the extent to which the acceptance of Darwin&#x27;s notions of gradual evolution demanded that naturalists shift from &quot;polythetic&quot; &quot;classification from below&quot;, &quot;the grouping of species into genera, genera into tribes, tribes into families, and so on&quot;, to &quot;monothetic&quot; &quot;classification from above&quot;, &quot;the division of the kingdoms into phyla, phyla into classes, and so on&quot; (Sokal &amp; Sneath, 1963, pp. 15-16).

== &quot;The New Museum Idea&quot; ==
Krefft, who had returned to Australia in 1860 &quot;with a comprehensive knowledge of the new approaches being adopted in Europe to the role and purpose of museums&quot;, was &quot;a dynamic figure who vigorously researched, wrote about and promoted the [Australian] Museum&#x27;s collections&quot;.

He served as curator at a time of significant culture change, both in terms of the place of science and scientific standards within the community, and in terms of the embedded assumptions, foundation principles, and experimental strategies of science itself. With Krefft as its curator, and despite the resistance of its trustees, the museum was slowly shifting &quot;from [being] a colonial offshoot of the British science establishment, managed by a group of gentleman naturalists, towards [becoming] an institution serving the needs of an increasingly independent and professional group of scientists&quot; (Stephens, 2007, p. 305).

=== Cabinets of curiosities ===
::Which is the most important object:that of collecting a cabinet of natural curiosities, to become the admiration of children and their nurses, or that of conveying knowledge and truth to the ignorant, to those in whose persons reside that power which will decide the future of this large and important country?G.H. Rowley, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, 8 August 1865.

For at least two centuries British (and colonial) museums, clearly reflecting their &quot;Wunderkämmer/Cabinets of Curiosities&quot; heritage, had done little more than present &quot;aimless collection[s] of curiosities and bric-à-brac, brought together without method or system of collections&quot;; where, for instance, one of the most famous collections in &quot;bygone days&quot;, that of the seventeenth century&#x27;s &quot;Musæum Tradescantianum&quot; (the collection which later provided the nucleus for Oxford University&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum), &quot;was a miscellany without didactic value&quot;, &quot;its arrangement was unscientific, and the public gained little or no advantage from its existence&quot; (Lindsay, 1911, p. 60).

In August 1846, within the Act establishing the Smithsonian Institution, was a provision transferring the custody of the United States&#x27; official &quot;National Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, that had been previously deposited in the US Patent Office Building, to the Smithsonian.

=== Public museums ===

Acknowledging the differences between a museum&#x27;s research and public pedagogy functions, and expressing his hope that his colleagues would &quot;heartily concur in doing all that is in our power to render [the British Museum] and other institutions conducive to the increase of the knowledge, the happiness, and the comforts of the people&quot;, John Edward Gray, towards the end of his lengthy career as the Curator of the British Museum, remarked that, in his view, &quot;public museums&quot; were meant to serve the dual purposes of &quot;the diffusion of instruction and rational amusement among the mass of the people, and ... to afford the scientific student every possible means of examining and studying the specimens of which the museum consists&quot;.

In the 1860s, a time when &quot;Colonial museums tended to exhibit specimens row upon row, and for the most part neglected to incorporate up-to-date techniques such as explanatory labels and habitat cases&quot; (Sheets-Pyenson, 1988, p. 123), Gray&#x27;s scientific position, his curatorial rationale, and his administrative approach were strongly supported by Krefft. Krefft, who was &quot;devoted to the museum&#x27;s interests&quot;, rather than to those of the trustees, had already begun separating his own museum&#x27;s research collections from its exhibition collections, and had already adopted many of Gray&#x27;s measures by the early 1860s.

Having just received Gray&#x27;s (1868) pamphlet in the mail, he emphasized in the presentation (&quot;Improvements Effected in Modern Museums in Europe and Australia&quot;) he gave to the Royal Society of New South Wales on 5 August 1868 that his (Krefft&#x27;s) ongoing efforts at the Australian Museum were made in the hope of changing it from being &quot;one of the old curiosity shops of fifty years ago&quot; into a &quot;useful Museum&quot; (Krefft, 1868b, p. 15). These curatorial aspirations were not unique to Krefft; they were entirely consistent with the world&#x27;s best practice, as described by Gray, in relation to displaying exhibits and mounted specimens at the British Museum &quot;to the best advantage, both for the student and for the general visitor&quot; (Krefft, 1868b, p. 21).

=== The &quot;new museum&quot; ===

In 1893, Sir William Henry Flower, labelled Gray&#x27;s (1864) view &quot;The New Museum Idea&quot;; and characterized it as &quot;the key-note of nearly all the museum reform of recent date&quot;, (Flower, 1893, pp. 29–30). Although these views were not unique to Gray, it does seem that Gray&#x27;s (1864) axiom had the widest dissemination over the ensuing years, was the most widely quoted and, therefore, can be said to have had the greatest influence influencing many world-wide, including Krefft, and in the UK, such as Flower, at the British Museum (see: Flower, 1898), and in the US, such as G. Brown Goode at the Smithsonian Institution (see: Goode, 1895), and Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the American Museum of Natural History (see, Osborn, 1912), etc.

In 1917, American museum director John Cotton Dana lamented the fact that there was still great room for improvement, noting that the best museum displays were to be found in department stores, rather than in museums of the day.

===Krefft&#x27;s curatorial rationale===
Krefft actively promoted the concept of the museum as a popular institution appealing to a broader audience: that is, an establishment designed to provide experiences that engage, entertain, &quot;and&quot; educate all ages, economic groups, education levels, and social classes, as well as being a place for the collection, preservation, and display of specimens, and the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Krefft&#x27;s curatorial advocacy of the complete separation of the Museum&#x27;s at-the-time confused and disordered collection into:
:(a) the exhibition spaces and the ordered, comprehensive, displays for the public (known today as &quot;synoptical collections&quot;), and
:(b) the (systematically housed elsewhere on the premises) specimens, catalogues, and other research material primarily intended for research, rather than display,
produced the on-going culture-clash with the (predominately expatriate) &quot;gentlemen amateurs&quot; among the Trustees including Dr. James Charles Cox, Edward Smith Hill, Sir William John Macleay, Captain Arthur Onslow, and Alexander Walker Scott, who were collectors themselves, who regarded their privileged access to the museum and its resources one of the perquisites they enjoyed in return for their unpaid services as trustees (Strahan 1979, p. 28), and were &quot;building up [their own] private collections sometimes at the expense of the museum&quot; that eventually led to Krefft&#x27;s later (1874) dismissal.

===Lack of funding===
At the same time that Krefft was experiencing difficulties with his (anti-Darwinian) trustees in relation to matters of specimen display, classification, and presentation, the trustees, themselves who operated under the provisions of the &quot;Australian Museum Act, 1853&quot; continuously complained of the absence of appropriate government funding to allow, regardless of what material they might contain, the construction of the required number of display tables, display cases, and display cabinets.

Many of those annual reports also contain specific, urgent appeals for additional funding to allow the publication of various items, created by Krefft, that were, at the time, complete and printer-ready. An extended, critical editorial in &quot;The Empire&quot; in 1868 noted that, although Krefft had a &quot;voluminous catalogue of the specimens contained in the library arranged for the printer&quot; it appeared that &quot;there are no funds to enable the trustees to carry out this necessary matter&quot;. In 1869, with no funds available for its publication, Krefft paid the Government Printer, himself (&quot;£225 for 700 copies&quot;), to produce his definitive work &quot;The Snakes of Australia&quot; (Strahan, 1979, p. 135).

== Photography ==
One of Krefft&#x27;s most important curatorial innovations was his introduction of photography, initially using his own personal camera, photographic equipment, chemicals, and photographic materials a medium he had first encountered during his time with the Blandowski Expedition in 1856–1857 into the Australian Museum&#x27;s practice.

Photography not only provided a valuable means through which the Museum&#x27;s objects and collections could be documented, but also served to substantiate the veracity of Krefft&#x27;s colonial observations, and enhance his (and the Museum&#x27;s) international recognition overall, due to the fact that, unlike single physical specimens, the photographs could also be &quot;endlessly duplicated&quot; and, therefore, sent simultaneously to a wide range of experts and centres of European and American scholarship other than just to London alone. Moreover, over time, photographs significantly reduced the need to send precious specimens and samples overseas to the detriment of the Museum&#x27;s own collections: see, for instance, the (1870) photograph of Krefft&#x27;s first-ever Queensland lungfish specimen (at Finney, 2022, p. 6), and the four (1870) photographs of the specimen at various stages of its dissection by Krefft (at Finney, 2022, pp. 6–7).

The thousands of meticulously arranged visual images on the glass plates that Krefft and his assistant, Henry Barnes, produced (over 15 years) through the collodion wet plate process, both on-site (at the museum) and in-the-field, recording landscapes and people (on expeditions), demonstrated and validated Krefft&#x27;s expertise to all and sundry.

According to Davidson (2017, pp. 16, 57, 68), given the London&#x27;s scientific elite&#x27;s widespread prevailing mistrust of the observations and material evidence of the colonial explorers and naturalists, Krefft&#x27;s images not only provided &quot;incontrovertible photographic evidence&quot; of his claims for a specific item of interest, but also given the extremely wide range of disciplinary mindsets prevailing at the time served as (inclusive) &quot;boundary objects&quot;: viz., entities that &quot;facilitate[d] an ecological approach to knowledge making and sharing&quot; by &quot;provid[ing] connections between different individuals and groups who nevertheless might view them, interpret them, and use them in distinct ways, or for different aims&quot; (p. 10).

== Queensland lungfish (&quot;Neoceratodus forsteri&quot;) ==

::For Krefft, the &quot;Ceratodus&quot; was not just a new species, it also created a unique device and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to establish and build Krefft&#x27;s own scientific authority and his reputation as a man-of-science and also put Australia at the centre of scientific thought.Vanessa Finney (2023).

=== Louis Agassiz and the &quot;Chimaera&quot; ===
In 1835, having examined teeth that had been extracted from the Rhaetian (latest stage of the Triassic) fossil beds of the Aust Cliff region of Gloucestershire in South West England, the Swiss natural historian Louis Agassiz had identified and described ten different species of a holotype (or &quot;type specimen&quot;), which he named &quot;ceratodus latissimus&quot; (&#x27;horned tooth&#x27; + &#x27;broadest&#x27;), and had supposed based upon the structure of their teeth plates resembling that of a Port Jackson shark that they were a kind of shark or ray, and from this, he had postulated, belonged to an order of the class of cartilaginous fishes (&quot;Chondrichthyes&quot;) collectively known as &quot;Chimaera&quot;.

=== Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous &quot;Burnett Salmon&quot; or &quot;barramunda&quot; ===

Over the 1860s, Krefft&#x27;s regular dinner companion, the pastoralist squatter and former Premier of New South Wales, William Forster, had often spoken of the Queensland fresh-water salmon &quot;with a cartilaginous backbone&quot;, well known to the Queensland squatters as &quot;Burnett Salmon&quot; called &quot;salmon&quot; because of its pink, salmon-coloured flesh and its good eating or &quot;barramunda&quot; (N.B. not barramundi). On each occasion, Krefft expressed his view that Forster&#x27;s claim of the existence of such a salmon was entirely mistaken.

=== January 1870 ===

In January 1870, Forster presented Krefft with an approx. 3 ft (92 cm) specimen of the Burnett Salmon that had been sent to him [Forster] by his cousin, William Forster M&#x27;Cord.

It was the first complete specimen that Krefft had ever seen. From his detailed (and, perhaps, unique to Australia) familiarity with the relevant scientific literature, and from the specimen&#x27;s unusual teeth, Krefft immediately &quot;understood its enormous significance&quot;, and recognized it as being something that &quot;was halfway between &quot;dead&quot; (fossilised, like its nearest relatives) and &quot;alive&quot; (known to science) and, thus, &quot;a living example of [Agassiz&#x27;s] &quot;Ceratodus&quot;, a creature, thought to have been like a shark, which had hitherto been known only from fossil teeth&quot;: a parallel to the (1994) recognition of the true identity of the &quot;Wollemi pine&quot; as a &quot;living fossil&quot;.

The lungfish is now widely recognized as a classic example of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;living fossils&quot; Huxley (1880, p. 660) noted that, &quot;this wonderful creature [sc. &quot;Ceratodus&quot;] seems contrived for the illustration of the doctrine of Evolution&quot; and its recognition as such, by the sagacious Krefft, represents a classic example of one of Walpole&#x27;s &quot;serendipitous discoveries&quot;: i.e., those made by &quot;accident and sagacity&quot;, in that:
Krefft immediately announced his discovery in a letter to the Editor of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, published on 18 January 1870 (1870a); and, in doing so, he also named the specimen after William Foster: &quot;Ceratodus Forsteri&quot;. It is significant that, by announcing his discovery in the pages of a Sydney daily newspaper, rather than in some &quot;learned British journal ... Krefft was not only claiming the lungfish, [but] was also staking a claim for Australian scientific independence&quot;. At the same time Krefft also made a request for regional settlers to provide observations and specimens of the &quot;Ceratodus&quot; for the Australian Museum. 

Krefft&#x27;s discovery was specifically mentioned within the comments of Australian Museum trustee Rev. William Branwhite Clarke on the mineralogical and geological exhibits at the 1870 Intercolonial Exhibition, held in Sydney; and, moreover, it was of such significance that the Exhibition&#x27;s report also included a poem, highlighting Krefft&#x27;s discovery, written by Clarke himself. In November 1889, Norman Lockyer, the founding Editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, noted that Krefft&#x27;s discovery of &quot;the Dipnoous [viz., &#x27;having both gills and lungs&#x27;] fish-like creature &quot;Ceratodus&quot; of the Queensland rivers&quot; was &quot;[one] of the more striking zoological discoveries which come within our [first] twenty years [of publication]&quot;.

== Krefft&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; articles in &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot; ==
In relation to Kreff&#x27;t considerable contributions to &quot;natural history&quot; whilst serving as the Museum&#x27;s curator, it is important to recognize that, over that time, rather than being disinterested in (or not entirely convinced by) Darwin&#x27;s views on the progressive development of species, a wide range of influential individuals in Australia were implacably opposed to Darwin, Darwin&#x27;s theories, and &quot;Darwinism&quot; in general.

=== George B. Mason and &quot;The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal&quot; ===
The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal was a fortnightly temperance-oriented journal with a limited circulation (specifically aimed at young people) that only lasted for three years (1859–1861).

Over the entire three years of the journal&#x27;s existence, the wood engraver, George Birkbeck Mason, supplied a regular series of 49 wood-engravings (as &quot;G. B. Mason&quot;), along with brief companion articles (as &quot;G.B.M.&quot;), under the title &quot;Australian Natural History&quot;, which introduced various Australian animals and birds to its young readers. Mason&#x27;s first article (on 2 July 1859) was on &quot;The Ornithorhynchus; or Water Mole of Australia&quot; (i.e., the Platypus), and his last (on 18 May 1861) was on the recently-introduced-to-Australia animal, the Llama.

=== Krefft and &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot; ===

One of Krefft&#x27;s main objectives, as its curator, was to re-position the Australian Museum as a &quot;forum of people&#x27;s science&quot; (Moyal, 1986, p. 99). With an enterprise anticipating that of the modern information scientist, Krefft recognized the economic, social, and educational value of a wider dissemination of an accurate, up-to-date knowledge and understanding of scientific matters (especially Australian natural history) to the emerging colony and its developing community, as well as &quot;teach[ing] the interested public more about Australia&#x27;s environments and animals&quot; (Finney, 2023, p. 35).
::    But what is the good of it? [viz., a study of Natural History] people frequently ask. Well, the answer is easy enough. The science teaches how to observe facts, and how to speak the truth; it makes us familiar with the habits and economy of various animals, and enables us to add to our comfort and to our wealth; it eases our mind, when travelling, to know that beasts of prey and noxious reptiles do not lurk in every bush; it saves us from starvation, because we can always find some creatures which may serve as food and sustain life; it prevents the useless expenditure of money in boring for coal, for instance, where coal cannot be found, or importing animals which are unable to exist in their new home. In fact, the knowledge of Natural History (Botany included) has brought great enterprises, such as Leichhardt&#x27;s first expedition, to a successful issue; whilst leaders as brave, but less versed in natural sciences, have singularly failed to accomplish their object.&lt;br&gt;    The principal cause of the death of the lamented Burke and Wills has been ascribed to the want of proper nourishment, and with a knowledge of natural history they would have been able to sustain life a good while longer. They were near water, and food in the shape of turtles, fishes, crayfish, mussels, frogs, and lizards could not have been far off. There are simple means of catching these animals, and natural history teaches where to look for them, and how to obtain them.&lt;br&gt;    We remember travelling, towards evening, at a funeral pace, far from the nearest station, in a vehicle which could not be moved quicker on account of the stupid driver having omitted to grease the wheels. All hands seemed to be resigned to a night&#x27;s lodging on the ranges, but one of them was lucky enough to kill a large lizard, and in a moment the frying-pan was out, the lizard&#x27;s fat rendered down, the wheels greased, and comfortable quarters reached before dark. It was the knowledge of the not very popular science again which saved us, and I shall never forget the astonished face of the driver when he saw what was going on.Gerard Krefft, in his first &quot;Natural History of New South Wales&quot; article, 4 March 1871.
In the absence of funding for potential museum publications, and in pursuit of a wider dissemination of these scientific matters, it is significant that from March 1871 until June 1874 Krefft contributed more than one hundred and fifty lengthy articles in the &quot;Natural History&quot; section of the &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot; a widely-read weekly magazine published every Saturday by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; on an extremely wide range of relevant subjects, specifically directed at an educated Australian lay audience; rather than, that is, engaging with his well-informed fellow scientists.

=== Krefft&#x27;s Enterprise ===

In his first article (Krefft, 1871a) reflecting a view that had been expressed a decade earlier by the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker Krefft noted that, although &quot;few countries offer such a wide field to the student of nature as Australia&quot;, there were very few &quot;handy books for the beginner&quot; available in Sydney, &quot;which has caused, in some measure, the apathy of the people to study our natural products&quot;. Moreover, he wrote, because &quot;the most useful books&quot; were little known, and given that many of those were &quot;so expensive that they cannot be purchased, except by the wealthy&quot;, he proposed to present a series of articles on Australian natural history, with the hope that their aggregate would eventually be published as a complete work.

=== Charles Darwin (naturalist) ===
As part of Krefft&#x27;s determination to disseminate up-to-date scientific knowledge, as reflected in the professional literature, a number of his &quot;Natural History&quot; articles mention Darwin&#x27;s matter-of-fact observations and opinions as an in-the-field naturalist: including, for instance, comments such as:
* &quot;According to Mr. Darwin, [earthworms] give a kind of under tillage to the land, performing the same below ground that the spade does above for the garden, and the plough for arable soil.&quot;Krefft (1871d).
* &quot;[In relation to the ruminants, and in] speaking about ten different varieties of oxen, I call attention to a curious breed of South America, of which Mr. Darwin, who first noticed it, remarks ...&quot;Krefft (1873b).
* &quot;Mr. Darwin has been quoted [in this article] at great length, because his experience ... [of] animals under domestication ... will interest all breeders.&quot;Krefft (1873c), etc.

=== Support of Darwin, Darwinism, and Natural Selection ===
By July 1873, according to his (12 July 1873) letter to Charles Darwin, Krefft had become exasperated by the widespread resistance to Darwin&#x27;s theories and observations (and, indirectly, also to those of Bishop Colenso); an unwillingness which, Krefft observed, was not only driven by the persistent outright misrepresentations of Darwin&#x27;s works by certain prominent critics (such as Professor McCoy and Bishop Perry), but was also explained by the fact that the preponderance of those in Australia who were opposed to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;theories&quot; had never read any of Darwin&#x27;s works and (with no other sources of information to go by) were basing their steadfast adversarial positions entirely upon the supposed authority of others: &quot;if ever there was a season when people flock round those who interpret the faith in which they were brought up, it is the present time, in Australia at least&quot; (Krefft, 12 July 1873).

Krefft wrote of the &quot;dreadful [overall] ... ignorance of even well educated people&quot;, and the constant criticisms of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;theories&quot; that were still being voiced in Melbourne, 13 years after the publication of &quot;Origins&quot;, by the devout Irish Roman Catholic Professor Frederick McCoy, Professor of Natural Science at the University of Melbourne, and the director of the National Museum of Victoria, and the Evangelical Anglican Bishop of Melbourne Charles Perry, as well as the recent (7 July 1873) well-attended &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; lectures, that had been delivered in Sydney by the Melbourne-based Irish Jesuit, Joseph O&#x27;Malley, and chaired by the devout Irish Roman Catholic layman, Justice Peter Faucett of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

In his letter to Darwin, noting that he &quot;never meddles with religion&quot;, Krefft stated that he deliberately avoided any reference to questions relating to the existence (or not) of the Abrahamic deity in his articles: &quot;Of course I shall not deny the existence of a supreme superintendent or whatever people choose to call the power of nature as yet unknown to us otherwise rather [to his &quot;astonishment&quot;] religious papers will not like to print my remarks&quot;.

=== July 1873 ===

In his quest to encourage people to read Darwin&#x27;s works, and to present a summary of the relevant scientific advances in the field (as represented in the professional literature), Krefft published two important &quot;Natural History&quot; articles in July 1873 and, as was his habit, Krefft took the position of presenting the latest views and opinions of others (for the edification of his readers), rather than expressing his own:
* &quot;Remarks on New Creations&quot; on 5 July 1873.
* &quot;Remarks on New Hypotheses&quot; on 12 July 1873.

====&quot;Remarks on New Creations&quot;====
The first article, centred upon an objective discussion of the current developments in the scientific understanding of artificial selection and human evolution (contrasted with the supposed &#x27;immutability of species&#x27;), only expressing Krefft&#x27;s personal views towards the end of the article, when speaking of the &quot;poor, ignorant, and superstitious&quot; people, whose artistic representations of angels were &quot;decidedly against the laws of nature&quot;.

====&quot;Remarks on New Hypotheses&quot;====

According to Krefft&#x27;s postscript to his letter to Darwin, the second article was only published after significant censorship by the editor of the &quot;Sydney Mail&quot;, George Eld, at the express (and extraordinary) instruction of John Fairfax, proprietor of the &quot;Sydney Mail&quot;, to remove Krefft&#x27;s favourable references to Darwin and his works according to Krefft, despite being &quot;rather a thorough believer in revealed Religion&quot;, Fairfax generally &quot;allow[ed] me to give an opinion now and then as long as [I] do not come it too strong&quot;. Consequently, rather than expressing his own views, opinions, and explanations of Darwin&#x27;s work, as he had intended, three-quarters of Krefft&#x27;s second article directly refers to the opinions expressed in a recent address, &quot;The Progress of Natural Science During the Last Twenty-Five Years&quot;, given at Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), by the University of Breslau&#x27;s Professor Ferdinand Cohn in late 1872. Krefft&#x27;s direct quotations included:
* &quot;There are three discoveries which, during the last quarter of a century, have entirely changed the position of natural science the mechanical equivalent of heat, spectrum analysis, and the Darwinian theories.&quot;
* &quot;No book of recent times, Dr. thinks, has influenced to such an extent the aspects of modern natural science as Charles Darwin&#x27;s work &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the first edition of which appeared in 1859 (the last or sixth edition in January, 1872); for even so late a period was the immutability of species believed in; so long was it accepted as indubitable that all characteristics which belong to any species of plants and animals were transmitted unaltered through all generations, and were under no circumstances changeable; so long did the appearance of a new fauna and flora remain one of the impenetrable mysteries of science.&quot;

=== Post-dismissal ===
Due to the distractions connected with the last stages of his disputes with the trustees of the Australian Museum, the last item he published whilst still Museum curator was on 27 June 1874. Sixteen weeks later, following his separation from the Museum, he resumed his weekly articles, and went on to publish another thirty-seven &quot;Natural History&quot; articles over the next nine months.

Although Krefft produced more than 250,000 words in the more than 180 &quot;Natural History&quot; articles published over that four-year period, his hope of eventually producing an aggregated single work was never realized; no doubt mainly due to his dismissal from office having greatly limited his resources and significantly restricted his capacity to continue his dissemination enterprise.

== Dismissal from office ==
The Trustees controversially dismissed Krefft from his position of Curator in 1874. &quot;The &quot;casus belli&quot;, now long forgotten, turned on the allegation that Krefft had mishandled a theft that had occurred in the Museum&quot; (MacLeod, 2009, p.145). Krefft&#x27;s position was that the trustees, acting independently of the New South Wales government, had no right to dismiss him.

Krefft&#x27;s assistant curator for the preceding decade, George Masters, had resigned in February 1874 in order &quot;to become curator of the growing collection of Sir William Macleay&quot; (Strahan, 1979, p. 135) a collection which Masters continued to curate, once it was transferred to the Macleay Museum at the University of Sydney, until his death in 1912.

The Museum trustees, at a special meeting held the day after Krefft&#x27;s removal from the Museum&#x27;s premises, appointed the Macleay &quot;protégé&quot;, Edward Pierson Ramsay, to the position of Curator (Strahan, 1979, p. 38), an office that Ramsay held until 1895, when he was succeeded by Robert Etheridge.

=== Gold theft and its aftermath ===

Following his return to the Museum on Christmas Eve 1873, Krefft reported to the trustees (who were individually and collectively unaware that any theft had taken place) that he had discovered a robbery of &quot;specimens of gold to the value of £70&quot;. The crime was never solved; and the trustees (although eager to do so) were unable to find any evidence of Krefft&#x27;s complicity in the theft. By this stage, with his accusations that the trustees were using the Museum&#x27;s resources to augment their own private collections, the &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; Krefft had fallen foul of most of the Trustees, especially William John Macleay, whose own extensive private collection which included the comprehensive collections he had inherited from his uncle, Alexander Macleay (1767–1848), and his cousin, William Sharp Macleay (1792–1865) went on to become the foundation of the collections of the Macleay Museum at the University of Sydney in the 1890s.

=== Museum closure ===
In the process of the escalating dispute between the trustees and Krefft, the Museum was closed to the public, by order of the trustees, for eleven weeks (from 4 July to 23 September 1874), At the same time, a police guard was stationed at the Museum, and Krefft was denied access to all parts of the Museum (including the cellar within which the fuel for his much-needed-in-the-winter fires was stored), except his private residence.

Krefft had been suspended following an investigation by a subcommittee of trustees Christopher Rolleston, Auditor-General of New South Wales, was appointed chairman, and Archibald Liversidge, Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Sydney, Edward Smith Hill, wine and spirit merchant, and Haynes Gibbes Alleyne, of the New South Wales Medical Board who, having examined a number of witnesses, found some of the charges against Krefft sustained, and also claim to have discovered &quot;a number of [other] grave irregularities&quot;.
Krefft had been unable to meet the trustees&#x27; request to appear before them on the Thursday (2 July 1874) because he was unwell (he had supplied a medical certificate to that effect), and that his wife, whose difficult confinement had been attended by George Bennett, had just delivered a stillborn child (on 2 July 1874), a daughter, after two days of intense labour (with Krefft by her side the whole time) in their residence over the Museum.

=== Eviction from his residential quarters ===
On 1 September 1874, three weeks before Krefft&#x27;s forceful eviction, long-term trustees George Bennett (who, at the time, was attending Mrs Krefft&#x27;s confinement) and William Branwhite Clarke both resigned &quot;as a consequence of the steps recently taken by the trustees of the Museum with respect to the Curator&quot;.

On 21 September 1874, Krefft and his family were physically removed from his Museum apartment within which he had barricaded himself, by the &quot;diminutive bailiff&quot; Charles H. Peart i.e., at least &quot;diminutive&quot; when compared with Krefft, &quot;a man of herculean stature&quot; in the company of one of the trustees, Edward Smith Hill, and assisted by two known prizefighters (identified as Kelly and Williams) who had been expressly hired (from Kiss&#x27;s Horse Bazaar) to effect the eviction, because the Police refused to act, on the grounds that Krefft had not been dismissed by the Government, only by the trustees (and, therefore, it was a civil (and not a police) matter).

At the time of his eviction, Krefft was forcibly carried out of his apartment, refusing to move from his chair, and was unceremoniously thrown out into Macquarie street by the prizefighters. The press report of Krefft&#x27;s subsequent (November 1874) damages action noted that, &quot;throughout the affair [Krefft] had denied the trustees&#x27; power to dismiss him; and, on the trustees appealing to the Government, the Colonial Secretary [viz., Henry Parkes] had cautiously told the trustees that, as they thought it expedient to expel [Krefft] without first seeking the advice of the Government, no assistance could be afforded&quot;.

At the time of Krefft&#x27;s forcible eviction, all of his possessions were seized; and, almost two years after the eviction Krefft was still complaining that &quot;my own and my wife&#x27;s personal property, my books, specimens, scientific instruments, medals and testimonials&quot;, all of which had been &quot;illegally taken possession of by the trustees&quot;, were still to be returned to him.

=== Trustee&#x27;s allegations ===

::The Trustees have to express their deep regret that circumstances have occurred during the past year which disclosed an utter want of care and attention in the discharge of his duties on the part of Mr. Krefft, their curator and secretary, and which resulted, after repeated acts of disobedience to the lawful orders of the trustees, in the removal of that officer from his position, and in the closing of the institution to the public for a short period.Trustees&#x27; justification for Krefft&#x27;s dismissal in their Report to the NSW Parliament for the year 1874.
The trustees two members of which, William Macleay and Captain Arthur Onslow (although both were Members of the Legislative Assembly they were not trustees, &quot;ex officio&quot;, but had been elected to their trustee position), &quot;manifested great animus towards Mr. Krefft, and used their utmost exertions to cast obloquy upon that gentleman&quot; responded by accusing Krefft of drunkenness, falsifying attendance records, and wilfully destroying a fossil sent to the Museum by one of its trustees, George Bennett, for its preparation to be sent on the Richard Owen at the British Museum. This entirely false allegation was completely (and independently) refuted by a letter from Owen, that Bennett had received in late June 1874, in which Owen &quot;acknowledged receiving [the fossil specimen] in good order&quot;.

Krefft was even accused of condoning the sale of pornographic postcards. The (fifty to sixty) postcards in question, of which the trustees claimed in their justification of Krefft&#x27;s dismissal, &quot;some of which were of the most indecent character&quot; (and had been &quot;seen&quot; by one of the trustees &quot;in the workshop of the Museum&quot;) which, rather than being salacious items were, in fact, standard &quot;ethnographic photographs&quot; taken in the field had been copied, entirely without Krefft&#x27;s knowledge or consent, by museum employees Robert and Henry Barnes.

=== Legal actions ===

::[In these matters] I am only one against many and you know that law is expensive and only made for the rich. Had I been an Englishman by birth, had I humbugged people, attended at Church, and spread knowledge on the principle that the God of Moses and of the Prophets made &quot;little apples&quot;, I would have gained the day, but [as] a true believer in [your] theory of I am hounded down in this [Paradise] of Bushrangers&#x27; of rogues, Cheats, and Vagabonds&quot;.Krefft to Charles Darwin (22 October 1874), seeking Darwin&#x27;s support.
In November 1874 Krefft brought an action to recover £2,000 damages for trespass and assault against the trustee, Edward Smith Hill, who was physically present at, and had directed his eviction.

The trial lasted four days, and Justice Alfred Cheeke, the presiding judge &quot;ruled that [Hill] and his co-trustees had acted illegally&quot;, and that, &quot;as the trustees had no power to appoint a Curator, they clearly had no power to remove him from office, or expel him from the Museum premises&quot;, and, finally, that &quot;[because] the Curator was an officer receiving his salary from the Government, ... he could not be removed from the premises without the sanction of the Government&quot;. &quot;The jury [of four], after a short deliberation, found a verdict for the plaintiff, with £250 for damages&quot;.

In September 1875, Hill applied to the NSW Supreme Court for a retrial, and his motion for a new trial was heard by Justices John Fletcher Hargrave and Peter (Noah&#x27;s Ark) Faucett over three days (7 to 9 September). Justice Hargrave, noting that the trustees&#x27; behaviour was &quot;altogether illegal, harsh, and unjust&quot;, and that they had acted &quot;without affording [Krefft] the slightest means of vindicating himself personally, or his scientific or official character as Curator of our Museum&quot; was of the opinion that a new trial should be refused. In contrast, Justice Faucett, noting that Krefft &quot;[had] taken an altogether erroneous view of his position and of the powers of the trustees; and [he, Faucett was] clearly of [the] opinion that his conduct justified his dismissal&quot;, was of the opinion that a new trial should be granted. Given these conflicting opinions, the court decided that Hill&#x27;s action could not be heard.

Hill&#x27;s counsel, Sir William Manning, immediately applied for a rehearing of the action before the full court of three judges. The application was unanimously refused by Justices Martin, Faucett, and Hargrave, on the grounds that, because the Chief Justice, Sir James Martin, was a Museum trustee &quot;ex officio&quot; and, therefore, could not sit on the Bench, the opinions of the remaining two members, Faucett and Hargrave, had already been clearly expressed.

&quot;When the courts awarded Krefft damages [in 1874], the trustees refused to pay up, though they had plundered the museum&#x27;s coffers to recoup their own legal costs&quot; (Macinnes, 2012, p. 114). In November 1877 Krefft sued the trustees for damages, and for the value of his medals and property detained by them, and was awarded £925. They offered to return his belongings with only £200.

=== Legislative proceedings ===
In 1876, with John Robertson (rather than Henry Parkes) as Premier, the New South Wales parliament passed a vote of £1,000 to be applied in satisfaction of Krefft&#x27;s claims. The Government refused to pay unless Krefft renounced all other claims, which Krefft refused to do. In December 1876 Krefft failed in his attempt to have the Supreme Court In Banco force the Colonial Treasurer to make the legislated-for payment.

=== Insolvency ===
He was declared insolvent in 1880.

== Death ==

Krefft failed to find new employment after his dismissal; &quot;his reforms and discoveries were recognised by many of his contemporaries and remain on the record as important contributions to imperial and global science&quot;, and &quot;[his] removal resulted in the impoverishment of the Natural sciences in New South Wales until the rise of inter-colonial science in the 1890s&quot;. His subsequent financial difficulties meant that he could not leave Australia, and &quot;many of his research papers remained unpublished and his collections were damaged and muddled&quot; (Rutledge &amp; Whitley, 1974).

He died in Sydney, on 18 February 1881, at the age of 51, from congestion of the lungs, &quot;after suffering for some months past from dropsy and Bright&#x27;s disease&quot;, and was buried in the churchyard of St Jude&#x27;s Church of England, Randwick.

== Research ==

* 1864: Published a &quot;Catalogue of Mammalia in the Collection of the Australian Museum&quot;.
* 1865: Published the pamphlet, &quot;Two Papers on the Vertebrata of the Lower Murray and Darling and on the Snakes of Sydney&quot; (1865a) the two papers had been read before the Philosophical Society of New South Wales.The pamphlet also included a third paper on the Aborigines of the Lower Murray and Darling (i.e., Krefft, 1865b).
* 1869: &quot;The Snakes of Australia&quot; was published, which was the first definitive work on this group of Australian animals.In the absence of funds for its publication, Krefft eventually financed the publication himself, and it was published by the Government Printer. Krefft and his publication were praised at the Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition of 1870 and the Scott sisters, Helena Scott (a.k.a. Helena Forde) and Harriet Scott (a.k.a. Harriet Morgan), received a Very High Commendation for the striking artwork that accompanied Krefft&#x27;s text.
* 1870: Published the first scientific description of the Queensland lungfish (Krefft, 1870a, 1870b, 1870c, 1870d, 1870e).
* 1871: Published &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot;, which also included plates by the Scott sisters.
* 1872: Krefft was one of the few scientists supporting Darwinism in Australia during 1870s; and, as of May 1872, became a correspondent of Charles Darwin see, for instance, Darwin&#x27;s acknowledgement, in &quot;The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms&quot; (Darwin, 1881, p. 122) of Krefft&#x27;s contribution to his investigations.
* 1872: On 30 December 1872, Krefft wrote to Charles Darwin (1872d); and, based upon Krefft&#x27;s direct, in-the-field experience as an anthropological linguist, informed Darwin that &quot;Australian natives&quot; could, indeed, count far beyond the number four thus correcting Darwin&#x27;s erroneous assertion that they could not (in &quot;Descent&quot; (1871a, p. 62), with Darwin apparently following Ludwig Büchner.
* 1873: Catalogue of the &quot;Minerals and Rocks in the Collection of the Australian Museum&quot; was published.
* 1877: Began publishing &quot;Krefft&#x27;s Nature in Australia&quot; see: item in the collection of the State Library of New South Wales a popular journal for the discussion of questions of natural history, but it soon ceased publication.

* He received a gold medal from the Government of New South Wales &quot;for services rendered&quot;.
* He held &quot;a silver medal for exhibits from the Emperor of the French, and ... various other silver and bronze medals awarded in the colony&quot;.
* He was awarded &quot;the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy&quot;.

== Legacy ==
His natural science expertise was often sought on unusual matters. In May 1870, for instance, he appeared as an &quot;expert witness&quot; in a case of infanticide (prosecution, J.E. Salomons; defence, W.B. Dalley) wherein Krefft testified that a set of exhumed bones were from &quot;a human skeleton&quot;.

Apart from his scientific contributions, Krefft is remembered for the demonstration he provided at the Australian Museum, on 14 February 1868, for Prince Alfred at the time, the Duke of Edinburg and, later, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha involving Henry Parkes&#x27; pet mongoose killing several snakes. The mongoose was subsequently presented to the Prince who took it with him when he left Australia on the HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; in May 1868.

He is also renowned for having eaten what may well have been the last extant specimens of the (now extinct) Eastern Chæropus (&quot;Chæropus occidentalis&quot;) then also known as &quot;Chaeropus ecaudatus &quot; whilst on the (1856/1857) Blandowski Expedition: &quot;They are very good eating, and I am sorry to confess that my appetite more than once over-ruled my love for science&quot; (Krefft, 1865a, p. 14).
::Krefft ... is the only person known to have kept the pig-footed bandicoot &quot;Chaeropus ecaudatus&quot; in captivity and his observations [viz., at Krefft, 1865a, pp. 12–14] are virtually the only natural history notes on this animal. Krefft&#x27;s illustration of &quot;C. ecaudatus&quot; far surpasses in capturing the essence of the animal, not least because it was drawn from life rather than from a stuffed skin.Menkhorst (2009), p. 65.
* In 1870 Krefft published the first scientific description of the Queensland lungfish (Krefft, 1870a, 1870b, 1870c, 1870d, 1870e).
* He is honoured in the scientific names of two reptiles endemic to Australia:
** &quot;Dwarf crowned snake (Cacophis krefftii, )&quot;, a species of venomous snake.
** &quot;Emydura macquarii krefftii&quot;, a subspecies of freshwater turtle.
* Other fauna also named after him:
** Freshwater longtom (&quot;Strongylura krefftii&quot;), is a species of euryhaline needlefish.
** Krefft&#x27;s darter (&quot;Telicota augias krefftii&quot;), a butterfly of the family Hesperiidae, found in the north of Australia.
** Krefft&#x27;s glider (&quot;Petaurus notatus&quot;), whose type specimen Krefft collected, was also named after him.
** Long-tailed myna (&quot;Mino kreffti&quot;), a member of the starling family.
** Northern hairy-nosed wombat (&quot;Lasiorhinus krefftii&quot;).
** San Cristobal treefrog (&quot;Papurana kreffti&quot;).
** Snub-nosed garfish (&quot;Arrhamphus krefftii&quot;)
* The mountain group of Krefftberget in the extreme southwestern part of Barents Island, Svalbard, Norway, was named after him in August 1870, by the Austrian explorer Theodor von Heuglin.
* Krefft Street, in Florey, Australian Capital Territory is named after him.

<text>A McLeod gauge is a scientific instrument used to measure very low pressures, down to 10−6 Torr (0.133 mPa). It was invented in 1874 by Herbert McLeod (1841–1923). McLeod gauges were once commonly found attached to equipment that operates under vacuum, such as a lyophilizer. Today, however, these gauges have largely been replaced by electronic vacuum gauges.

The design of a McLeod gauge is somewhat similar to that of a mercury-column manometer. Typically it is filled with mercury. If used incorrectly, this mercury can escape and contaminate the vacuum system attached to the gauge.
McLeod gauges operate by taking in a sample volume of gas from a vacuum chamber, then compressing it by tilting and infilling with mercury. The pressure in this smaller volume is then measured by a mercury manometer, and knowing the compression ratio (the ratio of the initial and final volumes), the pressure of the original vacuum can be determined by applying Boyle&#x27;s law.

This method is fairly accurate for non-condensable gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen. However, condensable gases, such as water vapour, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and pump-oil vapors may be in gaseous form in the low pressure of the vacuum chamber, but will condense when compressed by the McLeod gauge. The result is an erroneous reading, showing a pressure much lower than actually present. A cold trap may be used in conjunction with a McLeod gauge to condense these vapors before they enter the gauge.

The McLeod gauge has the advantage that its calibration is nearly the same for all non-condensable gases. The device can be manually operated and the scale read visually, or the process can be automated in various ways. For example, a small electric motor can periodically rotate the assembly to collect a gas sample. If a fine platinum wire is in the capillary tube, its resistance indicates the height of the mercury column around it.

Modern electronic vacuum gauges are simpler to use, less fragile, and do not present a mercury hazard, but their reading is highly dependent on the chemical nature of the gas being measured, and their calibration is unstable. For this reason, McLeod gauges continue to be used as a calibration standard for electronic gauges.

<text>Business process modeling (BPM) is the action of capturing and representing processes of an enterprise (i.e. modeling them), so that the current business processes may be analyzed, applied securely and consistently, improved, and automated. 

BPM is typically performed by business analysts, with subject matter experts collaborating with these teams to accurately model processes. It is primarily used in business process management, software development, or systems engineering.

Alternatively, process models can be directly modeled from IT systems, such as event logs.

== Overview ==

According to the Association of Business Process Management Professionals (ABPMP), business process modeling is one discipline of business process management that comprises the following five disciplines: (Chapter 1.4 CBOK® structure) ← automatic translation from German
* Process modeling
* Process analysis (understanding the as-is processes and their alignment with the company&#x27;s objectives - analysis of business activities)
* Process design (redesign - business process reengineering - or redesign of business processes - business process optimization)
* Process performance measurement (can focus on the factors of time, cost, capacity, and quality or on the overarching view of waste)
* Process transformation (planned, structured development, technical realization, and transfer to ongoing operations)
However, a completely separate consideration of the disciplines is not possible: Business process modeling always requires a &quot;business process analysis&quot; for modeling the as-is processes (see section Analysis of business activities) or specifications from &quot;process design&quot; for modeling the to-be processes (see sections Business process reengineering and Business process optimization).

The focus of business process modeling is on the representation of the flow of actions (activities), according to Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann consisting &quot;of the cross-functional identification of value-adding activities that generate specific services expected by the customer and whose results have strategic significance for the company. They can extend beyond company boundaries and involve activities of customers, suppliers, or even competitors.&quot; (Chapter 2.1 Differences between processes and business processes) ← automatic translation from German

But also other qualities (facts) such as data and business objects (as inputs/outputs, formal organizations and roles (responsible/accountable/consulted/informed persons, see RACI), resources and IT-systems as well as guidelines/instructions (work equipment), requirements, key figures etc. can be modeled.

The more of these characteristics are incorporated into the business process modeling, the better the abstraction of the business process models reflects reality - and the more complex the business process models become. &quot;To reduce complexity and improve the comprehensibility and transparency of the models, the use of a view concept is recommended.&quot;(Chapter 2.4 Views of process modeling) ← automatic translation from German There is also a brief comparison of the view concepts of five relevant German-speaking schools of business informatics: 1) August W. Scheer, 2) Hubert Österle, 3) Otto K. Ferstl and Elmar J. Sinz, 4) Hermann Gehring and 5) Andreas Gadatsch.

The term &quot;view&quot;s (August W. Scheer, Otto K. Ferstl and Elmar J. Sinz, Hermann Gehring and Andreas Gadatsch) is not used uniformly in all schools of business informatics - alternative terms are &quot;design dimensions&quot; (Hubert Österle) or &quot;perspectives&quot; (Zachman).

M. Rosemann, A. Schwegmann, and P. Delfmann also see disadvantages in the &quot;concept of views&quot;: &quot;It is conceivable to create information models for each perspective separately and thus partially redundantly. However, redundancies always mean increased maintenance effort and jeopardize the consistency of the models.&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German

According to Andreas Gadatsch, &quot;business process modeling is understood as a part of business process management alongside process definition and process management&quot;. (Chapter 1.1 Process management) ← automatic translation from German

Business process modeling is also a central aspect of holistic company mapping - which also deals with the mapping of the corporate mission statement, corporate policy/corporate governance, organizational structure, process organization, application architecture, regulations and interest groups as well as the market.
According to the European Association of Business Process Management EABPM, &quot;there are three different types of end-to-end business processes:
* Leadership processes;
* Execution processes and
* Support processes.&quot; (Chapter 2.4 Process types) ← automatic translation from German

These three process types can be identified in every company and are used in practice almost without exception as the top level for structuring business process models. Instead the term &quot;leadership processes&quot; the term &quot;management processes&quot; is typically used. Instead of the term &quot;execution processes&quot; the term &quot;core processes&quot; has become widely accepted. (Chapter 6.2.1 Objectives and concept) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 1.3 The concept of process) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 4.12.2 Differentiation between core and support objectives) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 6.2.2 Identification and rough draft) ← automatic translation from German

If the &quot;core processes&quot; are then organized/decomposed at the next level in supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and product lifecycle management (PLM), standard models of large organizations and industry associations such as the &quot;SCOR model&quot; can also be integrated into business process modeling.

== History ==
Techniques to model business processes such as the flow chart, functional flow block diagram, control flow diagram, Gantt chart, PERT diagram, and IDEF have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century. The Gantt charts were among the first to arrive around 1899, the flow charts in the 1920s, functional flow block diagram and PERT in the 1950s, and data-flow diagrams and IDEF in the 1970s. Among the modern methods are Unified Modeling Language and Business Process Model and Notation. Still, these represent just a fraction of the methodologies used over the years to document business processes. The term &quot;business process modeling&quot; was coined in the 1960s in the field of systems engineering by S. Williams in his 1967 article &quot;Business Process Modelling Improves Administrative Control&quot;. His idea was that techniques for obtaining a better understanding of physical control systems could be used in a similar way for business processes. It was not until the 1990s that the term became popular.

In the 1990s, the term &quot;process&quot; became a new productivity paradigm. Companies were encouraged to think in &quot;processes&quot; instead of &quot;functions&quot; and &quot;procedures&quot;. Process thinking looks at the chain of events in the company from purchase to supply, from order retrieval to sales, etc. The traditional modeling tools were developed to illustrate time and cost, while modern tools focus on cross-functional activities. These cross-functional activities have increased significantly in number and importance, due to the growth of complexity and dependence. New methodologies include business process redesign, business process innovation, business process management, integrated business planning, among others, all &quot;aiming at improving processes across the traditional functions that comprise a company&quot;.

In the field of software engineering, the term &quot;business process modeling&quot; opposed the common software process modeling, aiming to focus more on the state of the practice during software development. In that time (the early 1990s) all existing and new modeling techniques to illustrate business processes were consolidated as &#x27;business process modeling languages&#x27;. In the Object Oriented approach, it was considered to be an essential step in the specification of business application systems. Business process modeling became the base of new methodologies, for instance, those that supported data collection, data flow analysis, process flow diagrams, and reporting facilities. Around 1995, the first visually oriented tools for business process modeling and implementation were presented.

== Objectives of business process modeling ==
The objective of business process modeling is a - usually graphical - representation of end-to-end processes, whereby complex facts of reality are documented using a uniform (systematized) representation and reduced to the substantial (qualities). Regulatory requirements for the documentation of processes often also play a role here (e.g. document control, traceability, or integrity), for example from quality management, information security management or data protection.

Business process modeling typically begins with determining the environmental requirements: First, the goal of the modeling (applications of business process modeling) must be determined. Business process models are now often used in a multifunctional way (see above). Second the model addressees must be determined, as the properties of the model to be created must meet their requirements. This is followed by the determination of the business processes to be modeled.

The qualities of the business process that are to be represented in the model are specified in accordance with the goal of the modeling. As a rule, these are not only the functions constituting the process, including the relationships between them, but also a number of other qualities, such as formal organization, input, output, resources, information, media, transactions, events, states, conditions, operations and methods.

The objectives of business process modeling may include (compare: Association of Business Process Management Professionals (ABPMP) (Chapter 3.1.2 Process characteristics and properties) ← automatic translation from German):
* Documentation of the company&#x27;s business processes
** to gain knowledge of the business processes
** to map business unit(s) with the applicable regulations
** to transfer business processes to other locations
** to determine the requirements of new business activities
** to provide an external framework for the set of rules from procedures and work instructions
** to meet the requirements of business partners or associations (e.g. certifications)
** to gain advantages over competitors (e.g. in tenders)
** to comply with legal regulations (e.g. for operators of critical infrastructures, banks or producers of armaments)
** to check the fulfillment of standards and compliance requirements
** to create the basis for communication and discussion
** to train or familiarize employees
** to avoid loss of knowledge (e.g. due to staff leaving)
** to support quality and environmental management
* Definition of process performance indicators and monitoring of process performance
** to increase process speed
** to reduce cycle time
** to increase quality
** to reduce costs, such as labor, materials, scrap, or capital costs
* Preparation/Implementation of a &quot;business process optimization&quot; (which usually begins with an analysis of the current situation)
** to support the analysis of the current situation
** to develop alternative processes
** to introduce new organizational structures
** to outsource company tasks
** to redesign, streamline, or improve company processes (e.g. with the help of the CMM)
* Preparation of an information technology project
** to support a &quot;software evaluation&quot;/&quot;software selection&quot;
** to support the customizing of commercial off-the-shelf software
** to introduce automation or IT support with a workflow management system
* Definition of interfaces and SLAs
* Modularization of company processes
* Benchmarking between parts of the company, partners and competitors
* Performing activity-based costing and simulations
** to understand how the process reacts to different stress rituals or expected changes
** to evaluate the effectiveness of measures for &quot;business process optimization&quot; and compare alternatives
* Finding the best practice
* Accompanying organizational changes
** such as the sale or partial sale
** such as the acquisition and integration of companies or parts of companies
** such as the introduction or change of IT systems or organizational structures
* Participation in competitions (such as EFQM).

== Applications of business process modeling ==
Since business process modeling in itself makes no direct contribution to the financial success of a company, there is no motivation for business process modeling from the most important goal of a company, the intention to make a profit. The motivation of a company to engage in business process modeling therefore always results from the respective purpose. &quot;Michael Rosemann, Ansgar Schwegmann und Patrick Delfmann&quot; lists a number of purposes as motivation for business process modeling:
* Organizational &quot;documentation&quot;, with the &quot;objective of increasing transparency about the processes in order to increase the efficiency of communication about the processes&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 2.5.4 Areas of application for process modeling in practice) ← automatic translation from German including the ability to create process templates to relocate or replicate business functions or the objective to create a complete company model
* Process-oriented &quot;re-organization&quot;, both in the sense of &quot;(revolutionary) business process re-engineering and in the sense of continual (evolutionary) process improvement&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German with the objective of a vulnerability assessment (Chapter 2.5.4 Areas of application for process modeling in practice) ← automatic translation from German, &quot;process optimization&quot; (e.g. by controlling and reducing total cycle time (TCT), through Kaizen, Six Sigma etc.) or &quot;process standardization&quot;
* Continuous &quot;process management&quot;, as &quot;planning, implementation and control of processes geared towards sustainability&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German
* &quot;Certifications&quot; according to DIN ISO/IEC 9001 (or also according to ISO/IEC 14001, ISO/IEC 27001 etc.)
* Benchmarking, defined as &quot;comparison of company-specific structures and performance with selected internal or external references. In the context of process modeling, this can include the comparison of process models (structural benchmarking) or the comparison of process key figures&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German
* Knowledge management with the &quot;aim of increasing transparency about the company&#x27;s knowledge resource in order to improve the process of identifying, acquiring, utilizing, developing and distributing knowledge&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German
* &quot;Selection&quot; of ERP software, which &quot;often documents its functionality in the form of (software-specific) reference models, so that it makes sense to also use a comparison of the company-specific process models with these software-specific models for software selection&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German, &lt; (Chapter 2.5.4 Areas of application for process modeling in practice) ← automatic translation from German
* Model-based &quot;customization&quot;, i.e. &quot;the configuration of commercial off-the-shelf software&quot; often by means of &quot;parameterization of the software through configuration of reference models&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 2.5.4 Areas of application for process modeling in practice) ← automatic translation from German
* Software development, using the processes for &quot;the description of the requirements for the software to be developed at a conceptual level as part of requirements engineering&quot;(Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 3 The path to a process-oriented application landscape) ← automatic translation from German, (Chapter 2.5.4 Areas of application for process modeling in practice) ← automatic translation from German
* Workflow management, for which the process models are &quot;the basis for the creation of instantiable workflow models&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German
* Simulation with the aim of &quot;investigating the system behavior over time&quot; and the &quot;identification of weak points that would not be revealed by a pure model view&quot; (Chapter 3.2.1 Relevant perspectives on process models) ← automatic translation from German

=== Business process re-engineering (BPR) ===
Within an extensive research program initiated in 1984 titled &quot;Management in the 1990s&quot; at MIT, the approach of &quot;process re-engineering&quot; emerged in the early 1990s. The research program was designed to explore the impact of information technology on the way organizations would be able to survive and thrive in the competitive environment of the 1990s and beyond. In the final report, N. Venkat Venkatraman summarizes the result as follows: The greatest increases in productivity can be achieved when new processes are planned in parallel with information technologies.

This approach was taken up by Thomas H. Davenport (Part I: A Framework For Process Innovation, Chapter: Introduction) as well as Michael M. Hammer and James A. Champy and developed it into business process re-engineering (BPR) as we understand it today, according to which business processes are fundamentally restructured in order to achieve an improvement in measurable performance indicators such as costs, quality, service and time.

Business process re-engineering has been criticized in part for starting from a &quot;green field&quot; and therefore not being directly implementable for established companies. &quot;Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann&quot; assess this as follows: &quot;The criticism of BPR has an academic character in many respects. ... Some of the points of criticism raised are justified from a practical perspective. This includes pointing out that an overly radical approach carries the risk of failure. It is particularly problematic if the organization and employees are not adequately prepared for BPR.&quot; (Chapter 6.2.1 Objectives and concept) ← automatic translation from German

The high-level approach to BPR according to Thomas H. Davenport consists of:
# Identifying Process for Innovation
# Identifying Change Levers
# Developing Process Visions
# Understanding Existing Processes
# Designing and Prototyping the New Process

=== Certification of the management system according to ISO ===

With ISO/IEC 27001:2022, the standard requirements for management systems are now standardized for all major ISO standards and have a process character.

==== General standard requirements for management systems with regard to processes ====
In the ISO/IEC 9001, ISO/IEC 14001, ISO/IEC 27001 standards, this is anchored in Chapter 4.4 in each case:
Each of these standards requires the organization to establish, implement, maintain and continually improve an appropriate management system &quot;including the processes needed and their interactions&quot;., , 

In the definition of the standard requirements for the &quot;processes needed and their interactions&quot;, ISO/IEC 9001 is more specific in clause 4.4.1 than any other ISO standard for management systems and defines that &quot;the organization shall determine and apply the processes needed for&quot; an appropriate management system throughout the organization and also lists detailed requirements with regard to processes:
* Determine the inputs required and the outputs expected
* Determine the sequence and interaction
* Define and apply the criteria and methods (including monitoring, measurement, and related performance indicators) for effective operation and control
* Determine the resources needed
* Assign the responsibilities and authorities
* Address the risks and opportunities
* Evaluate these processes and implement any changes needed for effective operation and control
* Improve
In addition, clause 4.4.2 of the ISO/IEC 9001 lists some more
detailed requirements with regard to processes:
* Maintain documented information
* Retain documented information for correct implementation

The standard requirements for &quot;documented information&quot; are also relevant for business process modelling as part of an ISO management system.

==== Specific standard requirements for management systems with regard to documented information ====

In the standards ISO/IEC 9001, ISO/IEC 14001, ISO/IEC 27001 the requirements with regard to &quot;documented information&quot; are anchored in clause 7.5 (detailed in the respective standard in clauses &quot;7.5.1. General&quot;, &quot;7.5.2. Creating and updating&quot; and &quot;7.5.3. Control of documented information&quot;).

The standard requirements of ISO/IEC 9001 used here as an example &quot;include&quot; in clause &quot;7.5.1. General&quot;
* Documented information by the standard requirements; and
* Documented information on the effectiveness of the management system must be included;
&quot;Demand&quot; in clause &quot;7.5.2. Creating and updating&quot;
* Labelling and description (e.g. with title, date, author or reference number);
* Suitable format (e.g. language, software version, graphics) and medium (e.g. paper, electronic); and
* Review and approval
And &quot;require&quot; in clause &quot;7.5.3. Control of documented information&quot;
* To ensure suitable and available at the place and time as required;
* To ensure protection (e.g. against loss of confidentiality, improper use or loss of integrity);
* To consider distribution, access, retrieval,and use;
* To consider filing/storage and preservation (including preservation of readability);
* To perform monitoring of changes (e.g. version control); and
* To consider storage and disposition of further whereabouts.

Based on the standard requirements,
* To determine and continuously improve the &quot;required processes and their interactions&quot;
* To determine and maintain the content of the &quot;documented information&quot; deemed necessary and
* To ensure the secure handling of &quot;documented information&quot; (protection, access, monitoring, and maintenance)
Preparing for ISO certification of a management system is a very good opportunity to establish or promote business process modelling in the organisation.

=== Business process optimization ===
Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann point out that the field of improvement of the three methods mentioned by them as examples for process optimization (control and reduction of total cycle time (TCT), Kaizen and Six Sigma) are processes: In the case of total cycle time (TCT), it is the business processes (end-to-end processes) and sub-processes, with Kaizen it is the process steps and activity and with Six Sigma it is the sub-processes, process steps and activity. (Chapter 6.3.1 Total Cycle Time (TCT), KAIZEN and Six Sigma in comparison) ← automatic translation from German

For the total cycle time (TCT), Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann list the following key features: (Chapter 6.3.2 Total Cycle Time (TCT)) ← automatic translation from German
* Identify barriers that hinder the process flow
* Eliminate barriers and substitute processes
* Measure the effects of barrier removal
* Comparison of the measured variables with the targets
Consequently, business process modeling for TCT must support adequate documentation of barriers, barrier handling, and measurement.

When examining Kaizen tools, initially, there is no direct connection to business processes or business process modeling. However, Kaizen and business process management can mutually enhance each other. In the realm of business process management, Kaizen&#x27;s objectives are directly derived from the objectives for business processes and sub-processes. This linkage ensures that Kaizen measures effectively support the overarching business objectives.&quot; (Chapter 6.3.3 KAIZEN) ← automatic translation from German

Six Sigma is designed to prevent errors and improve the process capability so that the proportion of process outcomes that meet the requirements is 6σ - or in other words, for every million process outcomes, only 3.4 errors occur. Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann explain: &quot;Companies often encounter considerable resistance at a level of 4σ, which makes it necessary to redesign business processes in the sense of business process re-engineering (design for Six Sigma).&quot; (Chapter 6.3.4 Six Sigma) ← automatic translation from German For a reproducible measurement of process capability, precise knowledge of the business processes is required and business process modeling is a suitable tool for design for Six Sigma. Six Sigma, therefore, uses business process modeling according to SIPOC as an essential part of the methodology, and business process modeling using SIPOC has established itself as a standard tool for Six Sigma.

=== Inter-company business process modeling ===
The aim of inter-company business process modeling is to include the influences of external stakeholders in the analysis or to achieve inter-company comparability of business processes, e.g. to enable benchmarking.

&quot;Martin Kugler&quot; lists the following requirements for business process modeling in this context: (Chapter 14.2.1 Requirements for inter-company business process modeling) ← automatic translation from German
* Employees from different companies must comprehend business process models, highlighting the critical importance of familiarity with modeling techniques. Acceptance of business process modeling is bolstered by the simplicity of representation. Models should be clear, easy to understand, and as self-explanatory as possible. Standardization of the presentation of inter-company business process models across different companies is essential to ensure consistent comprehensibility and acceptance, particularly given the varied representations used within different organizations. It is imperative to employ an industry-neutral modeling technique to accommodate the diverse backgrounds of companies along the value chain (supplier, manufacturer, retailer, customer), which typically span different industries.

== Topics ==
=== Analysis of business activities ===
==== Define framework conditions ====
The analysis of business activities determines and defines the framework conditions for successful business process modeling. This is where the company should start,
* define the relevant &quot;applications&quot; of business process modeling on the basis of the business model and where it is positioned in the value chain,
* derive the &quot;strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling&quot; from the business strategy and develop an approach for structuring the business process models. Both the relevant &quot;purposes&quot; and the &quot;strategy&quot; directly influence the process map.
This &quot;strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling&quot; can be characterized by the market-oriented view and/or the resource-based view. &quot;Jörg Becker and Volker Meise&quot; explain: &quot;Whereas in the market view, the industry and the behavior of competitors directly determine a company&#x27;s strategy, the resource-oriented approach takes an internal view by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the company and deriving the direction of development of the strategy from this.&quot; (Chapter 4.6 The resource-based view) ← automatic translation from German And further: &quot;The alternative character initially formulated in the literature between the market-based and resource-based view has now given way to a differentiated perspective. The core competence approach is seen as an important contribution to the explanation of success potential, which is used alongside the existing, market-oriented approaches.&quot;(Chapter 4.7 Combination of views) ← automatic translation from German Depending on the company&#x27;s strategy, the &quot;process map&quot; will therefore be the business process models with a view to market development and to resource optimization in a balanced manner.

==== Identify business processes ====
Following the identification phase, a company&#x27;s business processes are distinguished from one another through an analysis of their respective business activities (refer also to business process analysis). A business process constitutes a set of interconnected, organized actions (activities) geared towards delivering a specific service or product (to fulfill a specific goal) for a particular customer or customer group.

According to the European Association of Business Process Management (EABPM), establishing a common understanding of the current process and its alignment with the objectives serves as an initial step in process design or reengineering.&quot; (Chapter 4 Process analysis) ← automatic translation from German

The effort involved in analysing the as-is processes is repeatedly criticised in the literature, especially by proponents of business process re-engineering (BPR), and it is suggested that the definition of the target state should begin immediately.

&quot;Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann&quot;, on the other hand, discuss and evaluate the criticism levelled at the radical approach of business process re-engineering (BPR) in the literature and &quot;recommend carrying out as-is analyses. A reorganisation must know the current weak points in order to be able to eliminate them. The results of the analyses also provide arguments as to why a process re-engineering is necessary. It is also important to know the initial situation for the transition from the current to the target state. However, the analysis effort should be kept within narrow limits. The results of the analyses should also not influence the redesign too strongly.&quot; (Chapter 6.2.2 Critical assessment of the BPR) ← automatic translation from German

==== Structure business processes - building a process map ====
&quot;Timo Füermann&quot; explains: &quot;Once the business processes have been identified and named, they are now compiled in an overview. Such overviews are referred to as process maps.&quot; (Chapter 2.4 Creating the process map) ← automatic translation from German
&quot;Jörg Becker and Volker Meise&quot; provide the following list of activities for structuring business processes:
* Enumeration of the main processes,
* Definition of the process boundaries,
* Determining the strategic relevance of each process,
* Analysis of the need for improvement of a process and
* Determining the political and cultural significance of the process (Chapter 4.10 Defining the process structure) ← automatic translation from German

The structuring of business processes generally begins with a distinction between management, core, and support processes.
* &quot;Management processes&quot; govern the operation of a company. Typical management processes include corporate governance and strategic management. They define corporate objectives and monitor the achievement of objectives.
* &quot;Core processes&quot; constitute the core business and create the primary value stream. Typical operational processes are purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. They generate visible, direct customer benefits.
* &quot;Support processes&quot; provide and manage operational resources. They support the core and management processes by ensuring the smooth running of business operations. Examples include accounting, recruitment, and technical support.

==== Structure core processes based on the strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling ====
As the &quot;core business processes&quot; clearly make up the majority of a company&#x27;s identified business processes, it has become common practice to subdivide the core processes once again. There are different approaches to this depending on the type of company and business activity. These approaches are significantly influenced by the defined &quot;application&quot; of business process modeling and the &quot;strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling&quot;.

In the case of a primarily market-based strategy, end-to-end core business processes are often defined from the customer or supplier to the retailer or customer (e.g. &quot;from offer to order&quot;, &quot;from order to invoice&quot;, &quot;from order to delivery&quot;, &quot;from idea to product&quot;, etc.). In the case of a strategy based on resources, the core business processes are often defined on the basis of the central corporate functions (&quot;gaining orders&quot;, &quot;procuring and providing materials&quot;, &quot;developing products&quot;, &quot;providing services&quot;, etc.).

In a differentiated view without a clear focus on the market view or the resource view, the core business processes are typically divided into CRM, PLM and SCM.
* CRM (customer relationship management) describes the business processes for customer acquisition, quotation and order creation as well as support and maintenance
* PLM (product lifecycle management) describes the business processes from product portfolio planning, product planning, product development and product maintenance to product discontinuation and individual developments
* SCM (supply chain management) describes the business processes from supplier management through purchasing and all production stages to delivery to the customer, including installation and commissioning where applicable

However, other approaches to structuring core business processes are also common, for example from the perspective of customers, products or sales channels.
* &quot;Customers&quot; describes the business processes that can be assigned to specific customer groups (e.g. private customer, business customer, investor, institutional customer)
* &quot;Products&quot; describes the business processes that are product-specific (e.g. current account, securities account, loan, issue)
* &quot;Sales channels&quot; describe the business processes that are typical for the type of customer acquisition and support (e.g. direct sales, partner sales, online).
The result of structuring a company&#x27;s business processes is the &quot;process map&quot; (shown, for example, as a value chain diagram). &quot;Hermann J. Schmelzer and Wolfgang Sesselmann&quot; add: &quot;There are connections and dependencies between the business processes. They are based on the transfer of services and information. It is important to know these interrelationships in order to understand, manage, and control the business processes.&quot; (Chapter 2.4.3 Process map) ← automatic translation from German

=== Definition of business processes ===

The definition of business processes often begins with the company&#x27;s core processes because they
* Fulfill their own market requirements,
* Operate largely autonomously/independently and independently of other business areas and
* Contribute to the business success of the company,
For the company
* Have a strong external impact,
* Can be easily differentiated from other business processes and
* Offer the greatest potential for business process optimization, both by improving process performance or productivity and by reducing costs.
The scope of a business process should be selected in such a way that it contains a manageable number of sub-processes, while at the same time keeping the total number of business processes within reasonable limits. Five to eight business processes per business unit usually cover the performance range of a company.

Each business process should be independent - but the processes are interlinked.

The definition of a business process includes: What result should be achieved on completion? What activities are necessary to achieve this? Which objects should be processed (orders, raw materials, purchases, products, ...)? 

Depending on the prevailing corporate culture, which may either be more inclined towards embracing change or protective of the status quo and the effectiveness of communication, defining business processes can prove to be either straightforward or challenging. This hinges on the willingness of key stakeholders within the organization, such as department heads, to lend their support to the endeavor. Within this context, effective communication plays a pivotal role.

In elucidating this point, Jörg Becker and Volker Meise elucidate that the communication strategy within an organizational design initiative should aim to garner support from members of the organization for the intended structural changes. It is worth noting that business process modeling typically precedes business process optimization, which entails a reconfiguration of process organization - a fact well understood by the involved parties. Therefore, the communication strategy must focus on persuading organizational members to endorse the planned structural adjustments.&quot; (Chapter 4.15 Influencing the design of the regulatory framework) ← automatic translation from German In the event of considerable resistance, however, external knowledge can also be used to define the business processes.

==== General process identification and individual process identification ====
&quot;Jörg Becker and Volker Meise&quot; mention two approaches (&quot;general process identification&quot; and &quot;individual process identification&quot;) and state the following about general process identification: &quot;In the general process definition, it is assumed that basic, generally valid processes exist that are the same in all companies.&quot; It goes on to say: &quot;Detailed reference models can also be used for general process identification. They describe industry- or application system-specific processes of an organization that still need to be adapted to the individual case, but are already coordinated in their structure.&quot; (Chapter 4.11 General process identification) ← automatic translation from German

&quot;Jörg Becker and Volker Meise&quot; state the following about individual process identification: &quot;In individual or singular process identification, it is assumed that the processes in each company are different according to customer needs and the competitive situation and can be identified inductively based on the individual problem situation.&quot; (Chapter 4.12 Individual process identification) ← automatic translation from German

The result of the definition of the business processes is usually a rough structure of the business processes as a value chain diagram.

=== Further structuring of business processes ===

The rough structure of the business processes created so far will now be decomposed - by breaking it down into sub-processes that have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the goal of the business process. This decomposition should be significantly influenced by the &quot;application&quot; and &quot;strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling&quot; and should be continued as long as the tailoring of the sub-processes defined this way contributes to the implementation of the &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot;.

A sub-process created in this way uses a model to describe the way in which procedures are carried out in order to achieve the intended operating goals of the company. The model is an abstraction of reality (or a target state) and its concrete form depends on the intended use (application).

A further decomposition of the sub-processes can then take place during business process modeling if necessary. If the business process can be represented as a sequence of phases, separated by milestones, the decomposition into phases is common. Where possible, the transfer of milestones to the next level of decomposition contributes to general understanding.

The result of the further structuring of business processes is usually a hierarchy of sub-processes, represented in value chain diagrams. It is common that not all business processes have the same depth of decomposition. In particular, business processes that are not safety-relevant, cost-intensive or contribute to the operating goal are broken down to a much lesser depth. Similarly, as a preliminary stage of a decomposition of a process planned for (much) later, a common understanding can first be developed using simpler / less complex means than &quot;value chain diagrams&quot; - e.g. with a textual description or with a turtle diagram (Chapter 3.1 Defining process details) ← automatic translation from German (not to be confused with turtle graphic!).

=== Assigning the process responsibility ===

Complete, self-contained processes are summarized and handed over to a responsible person or team. The &quot;process owner&quot; is responsible for success, creates the framework conditions, and coordinates his or her approach with that of the other process owners. Furthermore, he/she is responsible for the exchange of information between the business processes. This coordination is necessary in order to achieve the overall goal orientation.

=== Modeling business process ===
==== Design of the process chains ====
If business processes are documented using a specific IT-system and representation, e.g. graphically, this is generally referred to as modeling. The result of the documentation is the &quot;business process model&quot;.
;&quot;As is&quot; modeling and &quot;to be&quot; modeling

The question of whether the business process model should be created through &quot;as is modeling&quot; or &quot;to be modeling&quot; is significantly influenced by the defined &quot;application&quot; and the &quot;strategy for the long-term success of business process modeling&quot;. The previous procedure with analysis of business activities, defineition of business processes and further structuring of business processes is advisable in any case.

;&quot;As-is&quot; modeling

Ansgar Schwegmann and Michael Laske explain: &quot;Determining the current status is the basis for identifying weaknesses and localizing potential for improvement. For example, weak points such as organizational breaks or insufficient IT penetration can be identified.&quot; (Chapter 5.1 Intention of the &quot;as is&quot; modeling) ← automatic translation from German

The following disadvantages speak against &quot;as is&quot; modeling:
* The creativity of those involved in the project to develop optimal target processes is stifled, as old structures and processes may be adopted without reflection in downstream target modeling and
* The creation of detailed &quot;as is&quot; models represents a considerable effort, also influenced by the effort required to reach a consensus between the project participants at interfaces and responsibility transitions
These arguments weigh particularly heavily if Business process re-engineering (BPR) is planned anyway.

Ansgar Schwegmann and Michael Laske also list a number of advantages of &quot;as is&quot; modeling: (Chapter 5.1 Intention of as-is modeling) ← automatic translation from German
* Modeling the current situation is the basis for identifying weaknesses and potential for improvement
* Knowledge of the current state is a prerequisite for developing migration strategies to the target state
* Modeling the current state provides an overview of the existing situation, which can be particularly valuable for newly involved and external project participants
* The &quot;as is&quot; modeling can be a starting point for training and introducing project participants to the tools and methods
* The &quot;as is&quot; model can serve as a checklist for later target modeling so that no relevant issues are overlooked
* The &quot;as is&quot; models can be used as starting models for target modeling if the target state is very similar to the current situation, at least in some areas
Other advantages can also be found, such as
* The &quot;as is&quot; model is suitable for supporting certification of the management system
* The &quot;as is&quot; model can serve as a basis for organizational documentation (written rules, specifications and regulations of the organization, ...)
* The requirements for workflow management can be checked on the basis of the &quot;as is&quot; model (definition of processes, repetition rate, ...)
* Key figures can be collected on the basis of the &quot;as is&quot; model in order to be compared with the key figures achieved after a reorganization and to measure the success of the measures.

;&quot;To be&quot; modeling

Mario Speck and Norbert Schnetgöke define the objective of &quot;to be&quot; modeling as follows: &quot;The target processes are based on the strategic goals of the company. This means that all sub-processes and individual activities of a company must be analyzed with regard to their target contribution. Sub-processes or activities that cannot be identified as value-adding and do not serve at least one non-monetary corporate objective must therefore be eliminated from the business processes.&quot; (Chapter 6.2.3 Capturing and documenting &quot;to be&quot; models

They also list five basic principles that have proven their worth in the creation of &quot;to be&quot; models:
* Parallel processing of sub-processes and individual activities is preferable to sequential processing - it contains the greater potential for optimization.
* The development of a sub-process should be carried out as consistently as possible by one person or group - this allows the best model quality to be achieved.
* Self-monitoring should be made possible for individual sub-processes and individual activities during processing - this reduces quality assurance costs.
* If not otherwise possible, at least one internal customer/user should be defined for each process - this strengthens customer awareness and improves the assessability of process performance.
* Learning effects that arise during the introduction of the target processes should be taken into account - this strengthens the employees&#x27; awareness of value creation.

The business process model created by &quot;as is modeling&quot; or &quot;to be modeling&quot; consists of:

==== Sub-processes ====
;Delimitation
August W. Scheer is said to have said in his lectures: &quot;A process is a process is a process.&quot; This is intended to express the recursiveness of the term, because almost every process can be broken down into smaller processes (sub-processes). In this respect, terms such as &quot;business process&quot;, &quot;main process&quot;, &quot;sub-process&quot; or &quot;elementary process&quot; are only a desperate attempt to name the level of process decomposition. As there is no universally valid agreement on the granularity of a &quot;business process&quot;, &quot;main process&quot;, &quot;sub-process&quot; or &quot;elementary process&quot;, the terms are not universally defined, but can only be understood in the context of the respective business process model.

In addition, some German-speaking schools of business informatics do not use the terms &quot;process&quot; (in the sense of representing the sequence of actions) and &quot;function&quot; (in the sense of a delimited &quot;corporate function&quot;/action (activity) area that is clearly assigned to a &quot;corporate function owner&quot;).
For example, in August W. Scheer&#x27;s ARIS it is possible to use functions from the &quot;function view&quot; as processes in the &quot;control view&quot; and vice versa. Although this has the advantage that already defined processes or functions can be reused across the board, it also means that the proper purpose of the &quot;function view&quot; is diluted and the ARIS user is no longer able to separate &quot;processes&quot; and &quot;functions&quot; from one another.

The first image shows as a value chain diagram how the business process &quot;Edit sales pipeline&quot; has been broken down into &quot;sub-processes&quot; (in the sense of representing the sequence of actions (activities)) based on its phases.

The second image shows an excerpt of typical &quot;functions&quot; (in the sense of delimited &quot;corporate function&quot;/action (activity) areas, which are assigned to a &quot;corporate function owner&quot;), which are structured based on the areas of competence and responsibility hierarchy. The &quot;corporate functions&quot; that support the business process &quot;Edit sales pipeline&quot; are marked in the function tree.

;Utilization

A business process can be decomposed into sub-processes until further decomposition is no longer meaningful/possible (smallest meaningful sub-process = &quot;elementary process&quot;). Usually, all levels of decomposition of a business process are documented in the same methodology: Process symbols. The process symbols used when modeling one level of decomposition then usually refer to the sub-processes of the next level until the level of &quot;elementary processes&quot; is reached. Value chain diagrams are often used to represent &quot;business processes&quot;, &quot;main processes&quot;, &quot;sub-processes&quot; and &quot;elementary processes&quot;.

;Workflow

A workflow is a representation of a sequence of tasks, declared as work of a person, of a simple or complex mechanism, of a group of persons, of an organization of staff, or of machines (including IT-systems). A workflow is therefore always located at the elementary process level. The workflow may be seen as any abstraction of real work, segregated into workshare, work split, or other types of ordering. For control purposes, the workflow may be a view of real work under a chosen aspect.

==== Functions (&quot;Tasks&quot;) ====

;Delimitation

The term &quot;functions&quot; is often used synonymously for a delimited &quot;corporate function&quot;/action (activita) area, which is assigned to a &quot;corporate function owner&quot;, and the atomic activity (task) at the level of the &quot;elementary processes&quot;. In order to avoid the double meaning of the term &quot;function&quot;, the term &quot;task&quot; can be used for the atomic activities at the level of the &quot;elementary processes&quot; in accordance with the naming in BPMN. Modern tools also offer the automatic conversion of a &quot;task&quot; into a &quot;process&quot;, so that it is possible to create a further level of process decomposition at any time, in which a &quot;task&quot; must then be upgraded to an &quot;elementary process&quot;.

;Utilization

The graphical elements used at the level of elementary processes then describe the (temporal-logical) sequence with the help of functions (&quot;tasks&quot;). The sequence of the functions (&quot;tasks&quot;) within the &quot;elementary processes&quot; is determined by their logical linking with each other (by logical operators or Gateways), provided it is not already specified by input/output relationships or Milestones. It is common to use additional graphical elements to illustrate interfaces, states (events), conditions (rules), milestones, etc. in order to better clarify the process. Depending on the modeling tool used, very different graphical representation (models) are used.
Furthermore, the functions (&quot;tasks&quot;) can be supplemented with graphical elements to describe inputs, outputs, systems, roles, etc. with the aim of improving the accuracy of the description and/or increasing the number of details. However, these additions quickly make the &quot;model&quot; confusing. To resolve the contradiction between accuracy of description and clarity, there are two main solutions: Outsourcing the additional graphical elements for describing inputs, outputs, systems, roles, etc. to a Function Allocation Diagram (FAD) or selectively showing/hiding these elements depending on the question/application.

The &quot;function allocation diagram&quot; shown in the image illustrates the addition of graphical elements for the description of inputs, outputs, systems, roles, etc. to functions (&quot;tasks&quot;) very well.

==== Master data (artifacts) ====
The term &quot;master data&quot; is neither defined by The Open Group (The Open Group Architecture Framework, TOGAF) or John A. Zachman (Zachman Framework) nor any of the five relevant German-speaking schools of business informatics: 1) August W. Scheer, 2) Hubert Österle, 3) Otto K. Ferstl and Elmar J. Sinz, 4) Hermann Gehring and 5) Andreas Gadatsch and is commonly used in the absence of a suitable term in the literature. It is based on the general term for data that represents basic information about operationally relevant objects and refers to basic information that is not primary information of the business process.

For August W. Scheer in ARIS, this would be the basic information of the organization view, data view, function view and performance view. (Chapter 1 The vision: A common language for IT and management) ← automatic translation from German

For Andreas Gadatsch in GPM (Ganzheitliche Prozessmodellierung (German), means holistic process modelling), this would be the basic information of the organizational structure view, activity structure view, data structure view, and application structure view. (Chapter 3.2 GPM - Holistic process modelling) ← automatic translation from German

For Otto K. Ferstl and Elmar J. Sinz in SOM (Semantic Objektmodell), this would be the basic information of the levels Business plan and Resourcen.

Master data can be, for example:
* The business unit in whose area of responsibility a process takes place
* The business object whose information is required to execute the process
* The product that is produced by the process
* The policy to be observed when executing the process
* The risk that occurs in a process
* The measure that is carried out to increase the process capability
* The control that is performed to ensure the governance of the process
* The IT-system that supports the execution of the business process
* The milestone that divides processes into process phases
* etc.

By adding master data to the business process modeling, the same business process model can be used for different &quot;application&quot; and a return on investment for the business process modeling can be achieved more quickly with the resulting synergy.

Depending on how much value is given to master data in business process modeling, it is still possible to embed the master data in the process model without negatively affecting the readability of the model or the master data should be outsourced to a separate view, e.g. Function Allocation Diagrams.

If master data is systematically added to the business process model, this is referred to as an &quot;artifact-centric business process&quot; model.

;Artifact-centric business process

The artifact-centric business process model has emerged as a holistic approach for modeling business processes, as it provides a highly flexible solution to capture operational specifications of business processes. It particularly focuses on describing the data of business processes, known as &quot;artifacts&quot;, by characterizing business-relevant data objects, their life-cycles, and related services. The artifact-centric process modelling approach fosters the automation of the business operations and supports the flexibility of the workflow enactment and evolution.

====Integration of external documents and IT-systems====
The integration of external documents and IT-systems can significantly increase the added value of a business process model.

For example, direct access to objects in a knowledge database or documents in a rule framework can significantly increase the benefits of the business process model in everyday life and thus the acceptance of business process modeling. All IT-systems involved can exploit their specific advantages and cross-fertilize each other (e.g. link to each other or standardize the filing structure):
* short response times of the knowledge database; characterized by a relatively high number of auditors, very fast adaptation of content, and low requirements for the publication of content - e.g. realized with a wiki
* Legally compliant documents of the rule framework; characterized by a very small number of specially trained auditors, validated adaptation of content, and high requirements for the release of content - e.g. implemented with a document management system
* Integrating graphical representation of processes by a BPM system; characterized by a medium number of auditors, moderately fast adaptation of content, and modest requirements for the release of content

If all relevant objects of the &quot;knowledge database&quot; and / or documents of the &quot;rule framework&quot; are connected to the processes, the end users have context-related access to this information and do not need to be familiar with the respective filing structure of the connected systems.

The direct connection of external systems can also be used to integrate current measurement results or system statuses into the processes (and, for example, to display the current operating status of the processes), to display widgets and show output from external systems or to jump to external systems and initiate a transaction there with a preconfigured dialog.

Further connections to external systems can be used, for example, for electronic data interchange (EDI).

=== Model consolidation ===
This is about checking whether there are any redundancies. If so, the relevant sub-processes are combined. Or sub-processes that are used more than once are outsourced to support processes. For a successful model consolidation, it may be necessary to revise the original decomposition of the sub-processes.

&quot;Ansgar Schwegmann and Michael Laske&quot; explain: &quot;A consolidation of the models of different modeling complexes is necessary in order to obtain an integrated ... model.&quot; (Chapter 5.2.4 Model consolidation) ← automatic translation from German They also list a number of aspects for which model consolidation is important:
* &quot;Modeling teams need to drive harmonization of models during model creation to facilitate later consolidation.&quot;
* &quot;If an object-oriented decomposition of the problem domain is carried out, it must be analyzed at an early stage whether similar structures and processes of different objects exist.&quot;
* &quot;If a function-oriented decomposition of the problem domain is undertaken, the interfaces between the modelled areas in particular must be harmonized.&quot;
* &quot;In general, a uniform level of detail of the models&quot; (in each decomposition level) &quot;should be aimed for during modeling in order to facilitate the comparability of the submodels and the precise definition of interfaces.&quot;
* &quot;After completion of the modeling activities in the teams of the individual modeling complexes, [the] created partial models are to be integrated into an overall model.&quot;
* &quot;In order to facilitate the traceability of the mapped processes, it makes sense to explicitly model selected business transactions that are particularly important for the company and to map them at the top level. ... Colour coding, for example, can also be used to differentiate between associated organizational units.&quot; (Chapter 5.2.4 Model consolidation) ← automatic translation from German

=== Process chaining and control flow patterns ===

The chaining of the sub-processes with each other and the chaining of the functions (&quot;tasks&quot;) in the sub-processes is modeled using Control Flow Patterns.

Material details of the chaining (What does the predecessor deliver to the successor?) are specified in the process interfaces if intended.

=== Process interfaces ===
Process interfaces are defined in order to
* Show the relationships between the sub-processes after the decomposition of business processes or
* Determine what the business processes or their sub-processes must &#x27;pass on&#x27; to each other.
As a rule, this what and its structure is determined by the requirements in the subsequent process.

Process interfaces represent the exit from the current business process/sub-process and the entry into the subsequent business process/sub-process.
Process interfaces are therefore description elements for linking processes section by section. A process interface can
* Represent a business process model/sub-process model without the business process model referenced by it already being defined.
* Represent a business process model/sub-process model that is referenced from two/multiple superordinate or neighboring business process models.
* Represent two/multiple variants of the same business process model/sub-process model.
Process interfaces are agreed between the participants of superordinate/subordinate or neighboring business process models. They are defined and linked once and used as often as required in process models.

Interfaces can be defined by:
* Transfer of responsibility/accountability from one business unit to another,
* Transfer of data from one IT-system to another,
* Original input (information / materials at the beginning of the business process),
* Transfer of intermediate results between sub-processes (output at the predecessor and input at the successor are usually identical) or
* Final output (the actual result / goal of the business process).

In real terms, the transferred inputs/outputs are often data or information, but any other business objects are also conceivable (material, products in their final or semi-finished state, documents such as a delivery bill). They are provided via suitable transport media (e.g. data storage in the case of data).

=== Business process management ===
See article Business process management.

In order to put improved business processes into practice, change management programs are usually required. With advances in software design, the vision of BPM models being fully executable (enabling simulations and round-trip engineering) is getting closer to reality.

==== Adaptation of process models ====
In business process management, process flows are regularly reviewed and optimized (adapted) if necessary. Regardless of whether this adaptation of process flows is triggered by continuous process improvement or by process reorganization (business process re-engineering), it entails an update of individual sub-processes or an entire business process.

== Representation type and notation ==
In practice, combinations of &quot;informal&quot;, &quot;semiformal&quot; and &quot;formal&quot; models are common: &quot;informal&quot; textual descriptions for explanation, &quot;semiformal&quot; graphical representation for visualization, and &quot;formal language&quot; representation to support simulation and transfer into executable code.

=== Modelling techniques ===
There are various standards for notations; the most common are:
* Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), proposed in 2002 by Stephen A. White, published by the Business Process Management Initiative - merged in June 2005 with Object Management Group
* Event-driven process chain (EPC), proposed in 1992 by a working group under the leadership of August-Wilhelm Scheer
* &quot;Value-added chain diagram&quot; (VAD), for visualizing processes mainly at a high level of abstraction
* Petri net, developed by Carl Adam Petri in 1962
* Follow-up plans (e.g. in the specific form of a Flowchart), proposed in 1997 by Fischermanns and Liebelt
* HIPO model, developed by IBM around 1970 as a design aid and documentation technology for software (in a non-technical, but business-oriented form)
* Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML), originally designed by the LML steering committee and published in 2013
* Subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM)
* Cognition enhanced Natural language Information Analysis Method (CogNIAM)
* SIPOC diagram, invented in the 1980s as part of the Total Quality Management movement and then adopted by Lean Management and Six Sigma practitioners
* Unified Modelling Language (UML), proposed in 1996 by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh, continuously revised under the aegis of the OMG (provides extensions for business process)
* ICAM DEFinition (IDEF0), developed for the US Air Force in the early 1980s
* Formalized Administrative Notation (FAN), created by Pablo Iacub and Leonardo Mayo in the 1990s
* Harbarian process modeling (HPM)
* Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), an XML-based language developed in 2002 by OASIS for the description and automation of business processes
* Turtle diagram (also turtle method, turtle model, 8W method), a simple, clear and easy-to-understand graphical representation of facts about the process

Furthermore:
* &quot;Communication structure analysis&quot;, proposed in 1989 by Prof. &quot;Hermann Krallmann&quot; at the Systems Analysis Department of the TU Berlin.
* &quot;Extended Business Modelling Language&quot; (xBML) (seems to be outdated, as the founding company is no longer online)
* Notation from &quot;OMEGA&quot; (object-oriented method for business process modeling and analysis, Objektorientierte Methode zur Geschäftsprozessmodellierung und -analyse in German), presented by Uta Fahrwinkel in 1995
* &quot;Semantic object model&quot; (SOM), proposed in 1990 by &quot;Otto K. Ferstl and Elmar J. Sinz&quot;
* PICTURE-Methode for the documentation and modeling of business processes in public administration
* Data-flow diagram, a way of representing a flow of data through a process or a system
* Swimlane technique, mainly known through BPMN but also SIPOC, the &quot;Process chain diagram&quot; (PCD) and other methods use this technique
* ProMet, a method set for business engineering
* State diagram, used to describe the behavior of systems

In addition, representation types from software architecture can also be used:
* Flowchart, standardized in DIN 66001 from September 1966 and last revised in December 1983 or standardized in ISO 5807 from 1985
* Nassi-Shneiderman diagram or structure diagram, proposed in 1972/73 by Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman, standardized in DIN 66261.

=== Tools ===
Business process modelling tools provide business users with the ability to model their business processes, implement and execute those models, and refine the models based on as-executed data. As a result, business process modelling tools can provide transparency into business processes, as well as the centralization of corporate business process models and execution metrics. Modelling tools may also enable collaborate modelling of complex processes by users working in teams, where users can share and simulate models collaboratively. Business process modelling tools should not be confused with business process automation systems - both practices have modeling the process as the same initial step and the difference is that process automation gives you an &#x27;executable diagram&#x27; and that is drastically different from traditional graphical business process modelling tools.

=== Programming language tools ===
BPM suite software provides programming interfaces (web services, application program interfaces (APIs)) which allow enterprise applications to be built to leverage the BPM engine. This component is often referenced as the &quot;engine&quot; of the BPM suite.

Programming languages that are being introduced for BPM include:
* Business Process Execution Language (BPEL),
* Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL).
* XML Process Definition Language (XPDL),
Some vendor-specific languages:
* Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) supports EPC,
* Java Process Definition Language (JBPM),
Other technologies related to business process modelling include model-driven architecture and service-oriented architecture.

=== Simulation ===
The simulation functionality of such tools allows for pre-execution &quot;what-if&quot; modelling (which has particular requirements for this application) and simulation. Post-execution optimization is available based on the analysis of actual as-performed metrics.
* Use case diagrams created by Ivar Jacobson, 1992 (integrated into UML)
* Activity diagrams (also adopted by UML)

== Related concepts ==
=== Business reference model ===

A business reference model is a reference model, concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of an enterprise, service organization, or government agency. In general, a reference model is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that performs them. Other types of business reference models can also depict the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area&#x27;s business reference model. These reference models can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.

The most familiar business reference model is the Business Reference Model of the US federal government. That model is a function-driven framework for describing the business operations of the federal government independent of the agencies that perform them. The Business Reference Model provides an organized, hierarchical construct for describing the day-to-day business operations of the federal government. While many models exist for describing organizations – organizational charts, location maps, etc. – this model presents the business using a functionally driven approach.

=== Business process integration ===

A business model, which may be considered an elaboration of a business process model, typically shows business data and business organizations as well as business processes. By showing business processes and their information flows, a business model allows business stakeholders to define, understand, and validate their business enterprise. The data model part of the business model shows how business information is stored, which is useful for developing software code. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process models and data models.

Usually, a business model is created after conducting an interview, which is part of the business analysis process. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions to extract information about the subject business process. The interviewer is referred to as a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants, not the facilitator, who provide the business process information. Although the facilitator should have some knowledge of the subject business process, but this is not as important as the mastery of a pragmatic and rigorous method interviewing business experts. The method is important because for most enterprises a team of facilitators is needed to collect information across the enterprise, and the findings of all the interviewers must be compiled and integrated once completed.

Business models are developed to define either the current state of the process, resulting in the &#x27;as is&#x27; snapshot model, or a vision of what the process should evolve into, leading to a &#x27;to be&#x27; model. By comparing and contrasting the &#x27;as is&#x27; and &#x27;to be&#x27; models, business analysts can determine if existing business processes and information systems require minor modifications or if reengineering is necessary to enhance efficiency. As a result, business process modeling and subsequent analysis can fundamentally reshape the way an enterprise conducts its operations.

=== Business process re-engineering ===
Business process reengineering (BPR) aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes that exist within and across organizations. It examines business processes from a &quot;clean slate&quot; perspective to determine how best to construct them.

Business process re-engineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations use this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.

===Business process management===
Change management programs are typically involved to put any improved business processes into practice. With advances in software design, the vision of BPM models becoming fully executable (and capable of simulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality.

====Adaptation of process models====
In business process management, process flows are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, optimized (adapted). Regardless of whether this adaptation of process flows is triggered by continual improvement process or business process re-engineering, it entails updating individual sub-processes or an entire business process.

<text>Francis Hall Johnson (March 12, 1888 – April 30, 1970) was an American composer and arranger of African-American spiritual music. He is one of a group—including Harry T. Burleigh, R. Nathaniel Dett, and Eva Jessye—who had great success performing African-American spirituals.

== Early years ==
Francis Hall Johnson was born on March 12, 1888, the fourth of six children of Alice Virginia Sansom and William Decker Johnson, who was a bishop in the AME Church. Johnson received an extensive education. He attended the private, all-black Knox Institute and earned a degree from Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina. He also attended Atlanta University, the Juilliard School, Hahn School of Music, and the University of Pennsylvania.

As a boy, Johnson was tutored on piano by his older sister, and he taught himself to play the violin after hearing a violin recital given by Joseph Henry Douglass, grandson of Frederick Douglass.

== Career ==
Johnson&#x27;s debut as a professional violinist occurred in a concert in New York in 1910. He went on to play the violin and viola professionally, including in the orchestra for the 1921 musical, &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. Johnson played in the orchestra led by James Reese Europe as it accompanied Vernon and Irene Castle on tour, and he played with the New York Syncopated Orchestra, led by Will Marion Cook in 1918.

In time, however, he became more interested in choral music, forming the Hall Johnson Negro Choir, the first of many choral ensembles, in 1925. The group first performed professionally at the Pythian Temple in 1928. Johnson and his choir became renowned through their participation in the 1930 Broadway production of Marc Connelly&#x27;s &quot;The Green Pastures&quot; as well as in national and international tours of the play, radio versions, the 1936 film adaptation, and Hallmark Hall of Fame television broadcasts.

Johnson would also go on to arrange music for and conduct his choir in more than thirty feature-length Hollywood films, besides a number of short films and cartoons. Johnson wrote &quot;Run, Little Chillun&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1933 and was produced in Los Angeles in 1935–1937 under the auspices of the Federal Theater Project. Another production of the folk opera was featured in San Francisco in 1939 as an exhibit of the Works Progress Administration at the Golden Gate International Exposition.

Also in 1937, the Hall Johnson Choir was featured in the soundtracks of the Frank Capra film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Zenobia&quot;. In 1941 they returned for yet another Disney film, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, specifically for the song &quot;When I See An Elephant Fly&quot;; Johnson himself voiced one of the crow characters, the Deacon Crow. Some members of the choir also provided voices to these characters as well except Cliff Edwards, who voiced the lead Dandy Crow.

In addition to his theatrical work, Johnson wrote the Easter cantata &quot;Son of Man&quot;, which premiered at New York&#x27;s City Center in 1946, the same year that the Hall Johnson Choir sang in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South.&quot; In 1951, the Hall Johnson Choir was selected by the United States Department of State to represent the United States at the International Festival of Fine Arts held in Berlin, Germany.

Johnson wrote of the spiritual:

True enough, this music was transmitted to us through humble channels, but its source is that of all great art everywhere—the unquenchable, divinely human longing for a perfect realization of life. It traverses every shade of emotion without spilling over in any direction. Its most tragic utterances are without pessimism, and its lightest, brightest moments have nothing to do with frivolity. In its darkest expressions there is always a hope, and in its gayest measures a constant reminder. Born out of the heart-cries of a captive people who still did not forget how to laugh, this music covers an amazing range of mood. Nevertheless, it is always serious music and should be performed seriously, in the spirit of its original conception.

Johnson was fluent in both German and French. Among the singers he coached were Marian Anderson, Charles Holland, Robert McFerrin and Shirley Verrett. His arrangements of the spirituals have been recorded by some of the world&#x27;s finest artists.

== Death ==
Johnson, aged 82, died of burns received during a fire at his New York apartment on April 30, 1970.

== Recognition ==
In 1975, Johnson was posthumously honored for his work in films by being elected to the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.

A 1931 bust of Johnson by Minna Harkavy was shown at an exhibition at the Moscow Museum of Western Art and was bought by the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.

In 1934, the Philadelphia Academy of Music recognized Johnson with an honorary doctorate.

Johnson&#x27;s photograph, taken by Sidney Cowell in 1960, is included in the National Portrait Gallery of the United States.

In September 2020, the Athens Cultural Affairs Commission included Hall Johnson in the first ten inductees of the Athens Music Walk of Fame installed downtown, alongside other, more contemporary honorees such as R.E.M., The B-52&#x27;s, and Vic Chesnutt. A plaque mounted in the sidewalk and mobile-app beacon honor Johnson&#x27;s career.

<text>Jeffrey Paul &quot;Jeph&quot; Jacques ( ) (born June 17, 1980) is an American-Canadian cartoonist who writes and draws the webcomic &quot;Questionable Content&quot;. Jacques has formerly created the webcomics &quot;indietits,&quot; &quot;Derelict Orbital Reflector Devices&quot; and &quot;Alice Grove&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Jacques was born in Rockville, Maryland, and was later adopted. He has a younger brother named Justin.

Jacques lived near Northampton, Massachusetts, where &quot;Questionable Content&quot; is set; in 2015, he moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Jacques graduated from Hampshire College with a degree in music. He was married to his business manager Cristi until their amicable separation in 2014. In 2017, Jacques travelled to France and remarried.

==&quot;Questionable Content&quot;==

&quot;Questionable Content&quot; (QC) is a comedic slice-of-life webcomic that Jacques started on August 1, 2003. It was initially published two days a week, and then moved up to three updates a week when Jacques published strip #16. On September 4, 2004, Jacques lost his day job, and decided to try publishing QC every weekday and make a living selling QC-related T-shirts.

==Other artistic endeavors==
Jacques was a member of Dayfree Press, an online webcomic syndicate which included other artists such as Christian Fundin and Pontus Madsen of &quot;Little Gamers&quot;, Sam Logan of &quot;Sam and Fuzzy&quot;, and Ryan North of &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;.

Jacques launched &quot;indietits&quot; as an anonymous side project on April 1, 2005, to use ideas that did not fit into &quot;Questionable Content&quot; setting. Compared to &quot;Questionable Content&quot;, it is a simple strip, eschewing detailed art and linear storyline in favour of reusable pre-drawn panels and one-shot jokes. To further broaden his drawing limits, Jacques created &quot;Jephdraw&quot; to place unnamed drawings of his onto the Internet. He puts anything from favored panels to simple sketches for others to see what he does in his spare time.

In September 2014, Jacques launched a new comic, &quot;Alice Grove&quot;, which updated once per week until the story finished in July 2017.

Early in 2015 Jacques purchased the domain name walmart.horse (using the more recently available ICANN-era generic top-level domains). The website&#x27;s sole page is an image of a horse in front of a Walmart store. Jacques created the website as a piece of postmodernist &quot;nonsense-art&quot;. In March Jacques posted a cease and desist letter he received from Walmart who claimed the website diluted their intellectual property. Although Jacques said he believes the site to be fair use, he said he would be willing to post a disclaimer on the site indicating that it is parody if Walmart requested it. Jacques gave up the domain after Walmart filed a domain dispute.

In October 2015, Jacques launched a new strip titled &quot;Derelict Orbital Reflector Devices&quot; at the URL &quot;dord.horse&quot;. The strip revolves around a pair of sentient solar collection satellites (known as &quot;DORDs&quot;), part of a network of 2 similar satellites that were placed around the Sun to gather energy for a civilization that has long since departed, leaving the DORDs to contemplate their purpose and while away vast stretches of idle time. Each strip consists of a centrally-placed white sun disk on a black starfield, with the two DORDs assuming various positions in front of the sun, and text balloons for either or both of them in most panels. DORD updated on a daily basis, but no strips have been published since November 19, 2015. The domain registration for &quot;dord.horse&quot; expired.

===Deathmøle===
In 2005 Jacques launched Deathmøle, a virtual post-metal band whose works are available online. The band is currently composed of three characters from his comic, &quot;Questionable Content&quot;. The name for the band appears in Strip 554 for the first time. Since its inception, Jacques has periodically released individual Deathmøle songs through his LiveJournal or his Tumblr where they remain available; newer albums have been released on BandCamp.

Jacques states that Deathmøle&#x27;s style &quot;...started out as a joke- I wanted to write and record a really stupid metal song ... and it turned out to be really fun. So fun, in fact, that I started writing more &#x27;serious&#x27; metal tracks, and that’s ... how the music evolved.&quot;

In chronological order, the Deathmøle albums are &quot;Moletopopolis&quot;, &quot;Long Songs&quot;, &quot;???&quot;, &quot;Trial Period&quot; (EP), &quot;Amps&quot;, &quot;Absent Gods &amp; Creatures Foul&quot;, &quot;Fear of Black Horses&quot;, &quot;Meade&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Advances&quot;, &quot;Permanence&quot; (ongoing) and finally &quot;Jephmøle&quot; (ongoing). Each album typically has seven or eight tracks with Trial Period&#x27;s three and Moletopopolis&#x27; fifteen being the extremes. The music is Jacques&#x27; original work, with the exception of a cover of Low&#x27;s &quot;Two-step&quot; on &quot;Long Songs&quot;.

On August 11, 2013, Jacques launched a Kickstarter project with a goal of $9,500 to professionally record the Deathmøle album &quot;Permanence&quot;. On September 10, 2013, the Kickstarter projects funding period ended with a total funding of $141,115 breaking all 10 of his listed stretch goals. Much of the funding came from fans of QC.

==Honors==

Jacques was the Artist Guest of Honor at the 2006 Albacon. His webcomic &quot;Questionable Content&quot; has been honored multiple times in the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards.

==Involvement in internet controversies==
Jacques&#x27;s relationship to major internet companies has twice gotten him attention from the kinds of high-profile media outlets that do not normally cover webcomic news. In 2017, he was part of a creator backlash against a plan by Patreon, a subscription platform, to add fees to donations regardless of their size. He was extensively quoted in the Washington Post as one of the leaders of the creators objecting to this plan: &quot;Jacques&#x27;s average patron gives him between $1 and $2 a month. Creators like him, who rely on small payments, said the new system would discourage their very business model.&quot;

Several years later, he again came to widespread attention when he was banned from Twitter for a prank at the expense of Twitter owner Elon Musk, which led to his being interviewed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

<text>Lyall&#x27;s wren or the Stephens Island wren (Traversia lyalli) was a small, flightless passerine belonging to the family Acanthisittidae, the New Zealand wrens. Now extinct, it was once found throughout New Zealand, but when it came to the attention of scientists in 1894, its last refuge was Stephens Island in Cook Strait. Often claimed to be a species driven extinct by a single creature (a lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cat named Tibbles), the wren in fact fell victim to the island&#x27;s numerous feral cats. The wren was described almost simultaneously by both Walter Rothschild and Walter Buller. It became extinct shortly thereafter.

==Taxonomy==
The bird&#x27;s scientific name commemorates the assistant lighthouse keeper, David Lyall, who first brought the bird to the attention of science. It was described as a distinct genus, &quot;Traversia&quot;, in honour of naturalist and curio dealer Henry H. Travers, who procured many specimens from Lyall. &quot;Traversia&quot; is a member of the family Acanthisittidae, or the New Zealand wrens – which are not wrens but a similar-looking lineage of passerines, originating in the Oligocene, and the sister group to all other songbirds. DNA analysis has confirmed that &quot;T. lyalli,&quot; the only member of its genus, is the oldest and most distinct lineage in the Acanthisittidae.

== Description ==
Lyall&#x27;s wren had olive-brown plumage with a yellow stripe through the eye. Its underside was grey in females and brownish-yellow in males and its body feathers were edged with brown.

Most distinctively, Lyall&#x27;s wren was flightless, with a reduced keel on its breastbone and short rounded wings. It is the best known of the five flightless passerines (songbirds) known to science, all of which were inhabitants of islands and are now extinct. The others were three other New Zealand wrens (the long-billed wren and the two species of stout-legged wren) and the long-legged bunting from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, all of which were only recently discovered as fossils and became extinct in prehistoric times.

Living Lyall&#x27;s wrens were seen only twice. The lighthouse keeper described the &#x27;rock wren&#x27;, as he called it, as almost nocturnal, &quot;running around the rocks like a mouse and so quick in its movements that he could not get near enough to hit it with a stick or stone&quot;.

==Distribution==

Historically, Lyall&#x27;s wren was found only on Stephens Island. Prehistorically, it had been widespread throughout New Zealand before the land was settled by the Māori. Its bones can be found in caves and deposits left by laughing owls on both main islands. Its disappearance from the mainland was probably due to predation by the Polynesian rat or &quot;kiore&quot; (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;), which had been introduced by the Māori. The presence of a flightless bird on an island 3.2 km from the mainland, along with Hamilton&#x27;s frog (&quot;Leiopelma hamiltoni&quot;), which can be killed by exposure to salt water, may seem puzzling, but Stephens Island was connected to the rest of New Zealand during the last glaciation when sea levels were lower.

==Extinction==
Much of what is commonly assumed to be established knowledge about this species&#x27; extinction is either wrong or has been misinterpreted, starting with the account by Rothschild (1905) who claimed that a single cat had killed all of the birds. The research of Galbreath and Brown (2004) and Medway (2004) has uncovered much of the actual history of the bird during the short time that it was known to researchers.

* 1879
** Early June?: A track to the site of the proposed lighthouse site is cleared, starting the period of human activity on the island.
* 1881
** 22 February: Marine engineer John Blackett surveys the site for the proposed lighthouse.
* 1891
** April: Preparations for the construction of the lighthouse are begun by starting to build a tramway and a landing site for boats.
* 1892
** April: Clearance of land for the lighthouse and the associated farm begins (three lighthouse keepers and their families, 17 people in total, would eventually be living on the island). The first report of the species was a note on the island&#x27;s birdlife made by the construction worker F. W. Ingram, which mentions &quot;two kinds of wren&quot; (the other one was probably the rifleman).
* 1894
** 29 January: The lighthouse commences working.
** 17–20 February?: This is a likely date for introduction of cats to Stephens Island. What can be said with any certainty is that at some time in early 1894, a pregnant cat brought to the island escaped.
** June?: A cat starts to bring carcasses of a species of small bird to the lighthouse keepers&#x27; housings. Lyall, who was interested in natural history, has one taken to Walter Buller by A. W. Bethune, second engineer on the government steamboat &quot;NZGSS Hinemoa&quot;.
** Before 25 July?: The specimen reaches Buller, who at once recognises it as distinct species and prepares a scientific description, to be published in the journal &quot;Ibis&quot;. Bethune lends Buller the specimen so it can be sent to London for the famed artist John Gerrard Keulemans to make a lithograph plate to accompany the description.
** Winter – early spring (Southern Hemisphere): Lyall finds several more specimens. He tells Buller about two more (but does not send them to him), and sells nine to Travers.
** 9 October: Travers, who recognizes the commercial value of the birds, sidelines Buller and offers the birds to Walter Rothschild, who was wealthier and thus more likely to pay a high price, further piqueing Rothschild&#x27;s interest by writing, &quot;in a short time there will be [no &quot;wrens&quot;] left&quot;. Rothschild acquires his nine specimens.
** 11/12 October: Edward Lukins makes a list of birds on Stephens Island; he apparently confuses the species with the South Island rockwren.
** 19 December: Rothschild has quickly prepared a description of the bird, as &quot;Traversia lyalli&quot;, which is read by Ernst Hartert at the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club meeting. Philip Sclater, the Club&#x27;s president and editor of the &quot;Ibis&quot; who knows of Buller&#x27;s article in preparation, brings up the matter to Hartert, who says he cannot withdraw Rothschild&#x27;s description without consent.
** 29 December: Rothschild&#x27;s description appears in the &quot;Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club&quot;.
* 1895
** 24 January: Travers offers Rothschild a specimen preserved in alcohol (with viscera intact) for £5 (about £745.92 in 2024&#x27;s money: U.K. House of Commons Library, 2003). Rothschild apparently agrees, but never receives the bird.
** 4–9 February: Travers and three assistants searched the island for the bird, but found none.
** Before 11 February?: Lyall writes to Buller: &quot;...the cats have become wild and are making sad havoc among all the birds.&quot;
** 7 March: Travers supplies Rothschild with some details of the bird&#x27;s habits. To his knowledge, the species had only been seen alive twice until then. He has only been able to procure one additional specimen, brought in by the cat as the bird was dying, which also had been preserved in alcohol.
** 16 March: The Christchurch newspaper &quot;The Press&quot; writes in an editorial:&quot;there is very good reason to believe that the bird is no longer to be found on the island, and, as it is not known to exist anywhere else, it has apparently become quite extinct. This is probably a record performance in the way of extermination.&quot;
** April: Buller&#x27;s description of &quot;Xenicus insularis&quot; appears in the &quot;Ibis&quot;. The name is immediately reduced to a junior synonym. In the same issue, Rothschild&#x27;s description is reprinted, with some additional remarks on the bird&#x27;s apparent flightlessness. The race to describe the bird sparks much animosity between the two men and Buller never forgives Rothschild for beating him to it; for details and quotes, see Fuller (2000).
** August: In a paper for the Wellington Philosophical Society, Buller speaks of a female bird he recently had examined. He later purchases this specimen.
** 28 November: Travers informs Hartert that Lyall was not able to find more specimens during the winter and he believes the bird to be extinct. He offers two alcohol specimens for sale, for the price of £50 apiece (nearly £7,549.06 in 2024&#x27;s money – to compare, the average lighthouse keeper&#x27;s wage in 1895 was £140 a year, equivalent to £15,430.26 in 2024).
** December: Travers tries another search for the bird, again without success.
* 1896
** 13 May: Travers, unable to sell the birds at such a high price, now wants to sell his specimens for £12 each, about £1,338.15 in 2024&#x27;s money.
** June: Lyall gets assigned to another lighthouse and leaves Stephens Island.
** 31 December – 7 January or longer: Hugo H. Schauinsland collects birds on Stephens Island, but cannot find many and no &quot;wrens&quot; at all. On 7 January, he collects the only specimen of the local South Island piopio acquired during his stay. It is the last record of that species.
* 1897
** 31 July: The principal lighthouse keeper, Patrick Henaghan, requests shotguns and ammunition from the Marine Department to destroy the &quot;large number of cats running wild on the island.&quot;
* 1898
** 5 September: Travers writes James Hector that he has one more specimen available. At some time before this date, he had sold Buller one specimen for Henry Baker Tristram and claimed he had &quot;two&quot; additional ones.
** 27 December: Travers writes to Hector, saying that Stephens Island &quot;is now swarming with cats&quot;.
* 1899
** 1 August: The new principal lighthouse keeper, Robert Cathcart, shoots over 100 feral cats since his arrival on 24 November 1898.
* 1901
** Travers offers &quot;his specimen of the Stephen&#x27;s Island Wren&quot; to the government for £35 (c. £3,902.95 in 2024); apparently, the bird is bought and deposited at the Colonial Museum with other skins. The collection is not reviewed until 1904, by which time a fifth has to be discarded due to insect damage. No record is made of the specimen since the offer, but the eventual sales price suggests it was among the collection deposited at the Colonial Museum.
* 1905
** Travers sells one specimen to the Otago Museum.
** Buller publishes his &quot;Supplement&quot;, in which he keeps using his name &quot;Xenicus insularis&quot;. He furthermore quotes an anonymous correspondent to &quot;The Press&quot;:&quot;And we certainly think that it would be as well if the Marine Department, in sending lighthouse keepers to isolated islands where interesting specimens of native birds are known or believed to exist, were to see that they are not allowed to take any cats with them, even if mouse-traps have to be furnished at the cost of the state.&quot;
* 1907
** Rothschild publishes his book, &quot;Extinct Birds&quot;. In a remarkable breach of &quot;nil nisi bonum&quot; (especially considering both men&#x27;s social standing), it contains several acrimonious attacks on Buller, who had died the previous year.
* 1925
** The last cats on the island were exterminated.
Considering Buller&#x27;s August 1895 note, it is probable that the species was exterminated by feral cats during the winter of 1895. Assuming the date of February 1894 for cat introduction was correct (there were certainly cats around in the winter months of that year), the winter of 1895 would see the second generation of cats born on the island reaching an age where the wren would have made ideal prey. Habitat destruction, sometimes given as an additional reason for the birds&#x27; disappearance, was apparently not significant: in 1898, the island was described as heavily forested and there was little interference with habitat beyond the lighthouse and its associated buildings. Large-scale destruction of habitat started in late 1903, by which time &quot;T. lyalli&quot; was certainly extinct.

==Specimens==

About 16–18 specimens (excluding subfossil bones) are now known. They were collected by the lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cat, by the keepers themselves and by professional collectors.

* Rothschild&#x27;s specimens, all of which were collected between July and October 1894:
** Natural History Museum, London: three (NHM 1895.10.17.13; 1939.12.9.76; 1939.12.9.77).
** American Museum of Natural History, New York City: four (AMNH AM 554502; AM 554503; AM 554504; AM 554505).
** Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia: one (ANSP 108,631).
** Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts: one (MCZ 249,400).
* Buller&#x27;s specimens, collected at unknown dates between 1894 and 1899:
** Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh: one (CM P24639), labeled as female and dated 1894 in Buller&#x27;s handwriting. Apart from the date discrepancy, it could be the bird Buller spoke of in August 1895; possibly the specimen was collected months before Buller had examined it. Alternatively, it could be the Bethune bird in case Buller kept it (he initially seems to believe it to be a female), as Rothschild (1907) believed. DNA analysis could, at least, clarify the bird&#x27;s sex.
** Canterbury Museum, Christchurch: AV917 and AV918, a pair from the collection of Buller&#x27;s son, dated 1899. They were acquired between late 1896 and 1899, but may have been collected before that date.
* World Museum, National Museums Liverpool: One confirmed (NML-VZ B.18.10.98.10). Purchased by Buller from Travers for Tristram, probably after late 1896 (but may have been collected earlier). Sold to the museum in October 1898.
* Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington: one (OR.005098) mounted specimen without data; may be Travers&#x27; specimen sold in 1901 or another one. This photograph by Dr Paddy Ryan shows the Te Papa specimen and another one – possibly the Otago Museum bird, but the matter is not clear.
* Otago Museum, Dunedin: one, but two catalog numbers (AV739 and AV7577) exist. It is not clear whether they represent re-cataloguing of the one specimen sold by Travers in 1905, or whether a specimen was lost.

* Unaccounted for (all collected in 1894 or very early in 1895):
** Bethune&#x27;s specimen: lent to Buller for the description, apparently later given back. If so, it was probably deposited at the Colonial Museum (now part of Te Papa) for safekeeping between 1895 and 1897, or
** Buller&#x27;s female mentioned in August 1895, or even both (if neither is CM P24639).
** Two of Lyall&#x27;s first three specimens (one was given to Bethune) remain unaccounted for. They may be part of Rothschild&#x27;s nine, or Buller&#x27;s three. They were not in Buller&#x27;s possession as of early February 1895.
** Travers&#x27; &quot;lost&quot; specimen referred to in January 1895. It is not certain that this specimen was indeed lost; it may have been one of the alcohol-preserved specimens mentioned in November 1895 and Travers may simply have withheld it so he could fetch a higher price as the bird became extinct.

==In the media==

* Lyall&#x27;s wren was featured in the episode &quot;Strange Islands&quot; of the documentary series &quot;South Pacific&quot; that originally aired on 13 June 2009.
* Lyall&#x27;s wren was the topic of the episode &quot;Stephens Island Wren and the Cobra Effect&quot; of the game show &quot;Citaeeded&quot;, published on YouTube on 8 June 2017.

<text>[[Seyyed]] Ahmad Motamedi (; born 1953 in Tehran) is an Iranian politician &amp; member of Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)&#x27;s Electrical Engineering faculty.

He was the chancellor of Amirkabir University of Technology from June 2014 to September 2021. He was the Iranian Minister of Communication and Information Technology until August 24, 2005, and was replaced by Mohammad Soleimani.Seyyed Ahmad Motamedi, Head of the Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of the Ministry of Science and Riyal of the Ministry of Science and Technology (RIA) Currency Quota for the Year 2000 He entered the country claiming to be used for endorsement plans. Despite the claim, he sold imported materials to the open market, but according to the official theory of the Law Office of the Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, there is no evidence that the product entered the warehouse or sold and opened. The Culture News report, in connection with the misconduct, led to the conviction of a trustee and his crime partner (deputy chief financial officer of the organization), both of whom were convicted last year after numerous bans on archery. They appealed, but the court of appeals ultimately upheld the judgment of the second panel of the Tribunal. In his performance record, Moamadi was in charge of the reform of the Ministry of Post and Telegraph and Telephone, which was impeached because of a weak performance on November 7, without the presence of the head of reform, with much scrutiny. Four people were eventually reinstated in their post to consult with MPs to get their opinion. At that time he introduced himself to the forces of value and claimed his impeachment was political. Meanwhile, Motamedi is now a close friend of Hojatoleslam Hashemi Rafsanjani. He was also a member of the outlawed committee of Mir Hossein Mousavi for nine years and his appointment as chairman of Amir Kabir University was met with widespread criticism. 

Motamedi earned his BS in Electronics from Amirkabir University of Technology in 1978 and his MS and PhD, both in Digital Electronics and Informatics Systems, from Pierre and Marie Curie University, France, in 1980 and 1983 respectively. He has been a faculty member of the Electrical Engineering department of Amirkabir University of Technology since 1984.

<text>Block letters (known as printscript, manuscript, print writing, printing or ball and stick in academics) are a sans-serif (or &quot;gothic&quot;) style of writing Latin script in which the letters are individual glyphs, with no joining.

Elementary education in English-speaking countries typically introduces children to the literacy of handwriting using a method of block letters (commonly referred to as manuscript by educators), which may later advance to cursive (joined) penmanship. The policy of teaching cursive in American elementary schools has varied over time, from strict endorsement such as the Palmer method in the early 20th century, to removal by Common Core in 2010, to being reinstated.

On official forms, one is often asked to &quot;please print&quot;. This is because cursive handwriting is harder to read, and the glyphs are joined so they do not fit neatly into separate boxes.

Block letters may also be used as to refer to block capitals, which means writing in all capital letters or in large and small capital letters, imitating the style of typeset capital letters. However, in at least one court case involving patents, the term &quot;block letters&quot; was found to include both upper and lower case.

Handwritten block letters generally can be digitalised more accurately by optical character recognition than handwritten cursive scripts. Block letters are naturally used in crossword puzzles.

<text>Sarah Austin ( Taylor; 1793 – 8 August 1867) was an English editor, linguist and translator from German-language books. She did much to make Germany familiar to the English.

==Life==
Born Sarah Taylor in Norwich, England in 1793, she was the youngest child of John Taylor, a yarn maker and hymn writer from a locally well-known Unitarian family. Her education was overseen by her mother, Susannah Taylor. She became conversant in Latin, French, German and Italian. Her six brothers and sisters included Edward Taylor (1784–1863), a singer and music professor, John Taylor (1779–1863), a mining engineer, Richard Taylor (1781–1858), a printer and editor and publisher of scientific works. Family friends included James Alderson and his daughter Amelia Opie, Henry Crabb Robinson, the banking Gurneys and Sir James Mackintosh.

Sarah grew up to be an attractive woman. She caused surprise by marrying John Austin (1790–1859) on 24 August 1819. During the first years of their married life they lived a wide social life in Queen&#x27;s Square, Westminster. John Stuart Mill testified the esteem he felt for her by the title of &quot;Mutter&quot;, by which he always addressed her. Jeremy Bentham was also in their circle. She travelled widely, for instance to Dresden and Weimar. According to a modern scholar, Austin &quot;tended to be austere, reclusive, and insecure, while she was very determined, ambitious, energetic, gregarious, and warm. Indeed her affections were so starved that in the early 1830s she had a most unusual &#x27;affair&#x27; with Hermann Pückler-Muskau, a German prince whose work she translated. It was conducted solely in letters – she did not meet him until their passions had cooled.&quot;

The only child of the Austins&#x27; marriage, Lucie, was likewise a translator of German works. She married Alexander Duff-Gordon. Her 1843 translation of &quot;Stories of the Gods and Heroes of Greece&quot; by Barthold Georg Niebuhr was erroneously ascribed to her mother. The family history was recorded in &quot;Three Generations of English Women&quot; (1893), by Sarah Taylor&#x27;s granddaughter, Janet Ross.

==Works==
Austin was initially encouraged as an author by the American John Neal, who sent her first works to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. Her writing and literary translations soon became important sources of income for her and her husband. She did much to promote her husband&#x27;s works in his life and published a collection of his lectures on jurisprudence after he died. In 1833, she published &quot;Selections from the Old Testament,&quot; arranged under heads to illustrate the religion, morality, and poetry of the Hebrew Scriptures. &quot;My sole object,&quot; she wrote in the preface, &quot;has been to put together all that presented itself to my own heart and mind as most persuasive, consolatory, or elevating, in such a form and order as to be easy of reference, conveniently arranged and divided, and freed from matter either hard to be understood, unattractive, or unprofitable (to say the least) for young and pure eyes.&quot; In the same year, she published one of the translations by which she is best known: &quot;Characteristics of Goethe from the German of Falk, Von Müller, and others,&quot; with valuable original notes, illustrative of German literature. Her own criticisms are few, but highly relevant.

In 1834, Austin translated &quot;The Story without an End&quot; by Friedrich Wilhelm Carové, which was often reprinted. In the same year she translated the famous report on the &quot;State of Public Instruction in Prussia,&quot; addressed by Victor Cousin to Marthe Camille Bachasson, Count of Montalivet, minister of public instruction. The preface pleads eloquently for the cause of national education. &quot;Society,&quot; she says, &quot;is no longer a calm current, but a tossing sea; reverence for tradition, for authority, is gone. In such a state of things who can deny the absolute necessity of national education?&quot; In 1839 she returned to the subject in a pamphlet, first published as an article in the &quot;Foreign Quarterly Review&quot;, where she argued from the experience of Prussia and France for the need to establish a national system of education in England.

One of her last publications (1859) were two letters addressed to the &quot;Athenæum&quot;, on girls&#x27; schools and on the training of working women, which show she had modified her opinions. Speaking of the old village schools, she admits that the teachers possessed little book lore. They were often widows &quot;better versed in the toils and troubles of life than in chemistry or astronomy... But the wiser among them taught the great lessons of obedience, reverence for honoured eld, industry, neatness, decent order, and other virtues of their sex and stations,&quot; and trained their pupils to be the wives of working men. In 1827 Mrs Austin left with her husband for Germany and settled in Bonn. She collected in her long residence abroad materials for her 1854 work &quot;Germany from 1760 to 1814,&quot; which still holds a place as an interesting, thoughtful survey of German institutions and manners.

In the autumn of 1836 she accompanied her husband to Malta, busying herself while there with investigations into the remains of Maltese art. They returned to Germany, then passed to Paris, where they remained until driven home by the revolution of 1848. In 1840 she translated Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s &quot;History of the Popes&quot;, which was warmly praised by Thomas Babington Macaulay and Henry Hart Milman. When the translation appeared, her intimate friend Sir George Cornewall Lewis wrote to her: &quot;Murray is very desirous that you should undertake some original work. Do you feel a &#x27;Beruf&#x27; of this sort?&quot; However, she felt no such &quot;Beruf&quot; (calling) and most of her subsequent works were translations.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1859 Sarah Austin produced a coherent, near-complete edition of his &quot;Lectures on Jurisprudence&quot;, a huge task that required assembling his scattered notes and marginalia. Her modesty about her contribution to her husband&#x27;s publications was recognized only by later authors. She also edited the &quot;Memoirs of Sydney Smith&quot; (1855) and &quot;Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s Letters from Egypt&quot; (1865).

Sarah Austin&#x27;s style is clear, unaffected and forcible. She adopted a high standard for the duties of a translator and sought to conform to it rigorously. &quot;It has been my invariable practice,&quot; she said, &quot;as soon as I have engaged to translate a work, to write to the author of it, announcing my intention, and adding that if he has any correction, omission, or addition to make, he might depend on my paying attention to his suggestions.&quot; She did much to make the best minds of Germany familiar to Englishmen and she left a literary reputation due as much to her conversation and correspondence with illustrious men of letters as to her works.

Here is a list of her other principal works, not named so far:
*&quot;Translation of a Tour in England, Ireland, and France by a German Prince,&quot; (London, 1832), after Pückler&#x27;s &quot;Briefe eines Verstorbenen&quot;
*&quot;Translation of Raumer&#x27;s England in 1835,&quot; 1836
*&quot;Fragments from German Prose Writers,&quot; 1841
*&quot;History of the Reformation in Germany&quot; and &quot;History of the Popes&quot; (1840), from the German of Leopold von Ranke
*&quot;Sketches of Germany from 1760 to 1814&quot; (1854), dealing with political and social circumstances during that period.
*Translation of François Guizot on the &quot;Causes of the Success of the English Revolution,&quot; 1850
*&quot;Memoirs of the Duchess of Orleans,&quot; 1859
*&quot;Lady Duff Gordon&#x27;s Letters from Egypt,&quot; edited by Mrs. Austin, 1865
*&quot;Letters of Sydney Smith,&quot; 1855 (second volume of Lady Holland&#x27;s Life and Letters)

==Death==
Sarah Austin died at Weybridge, Surrey, on 8 August 1867. She was buried beside her husband in the Weybridge churchyard. Her estate, worth less than £5000, received probate on 28 August 1867 through her executor son-in-law, Sir Alexander Cornewall Duff-Gordon.

<text>Mário de Sá-Carneiro (; May 19, 1890 – April 26, 1916) was a Portuguese poet and writer. He is one of the best known authors of the &quot;Geração D&#x27;Orpheu&quot;, and is usually considered their greatest poet, after Fernando Pessoa.

==Life==
Mário de Sá-Carneiro was born to a wealthy family with a strong military tradition. His mother died in 1892 when he was two years old, and he was subsequently raised by his grandparents. He lived on a farm near Lisbon where he would spend most of his life. Sá-Carneiro started writing poems at the age of 12. By the age of 15, he had already translated several works by Victor Hugo. By 16, he had translated some works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. He began to write fiction in high school, partly due to his work as an actor. In 1911, he left for Coimbra, where he was admitted to law school, although he never progressed beyond his first year. However, he met a man who would soon become his closest friend, Fernando Pessoa, and who introduced him to the group of modernists of Lisbon.

After leaving the &quot;city of students&quot;, as Coimbra is known, Sá-Carneiro went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. Although his father continued to pay for his studies, Sá-Carneiro stopped attending classes very soon after arriving in Paris. He lived a bohemian lifestyle, roaming round the theatres and bars.

It was in Paris that he met Guilherme de Santa-Rita (Santa-Rita Pintor), the legendary Portuguese painter.

===&quot;Orpheu&quot;===
Together with Fernando Pessoa and Almada Negreiros, he wrote for &quot;Orpheu&quot;, a literary journal of poetry and artistic prose influenced by cosmopolitanism and the European &quot;Avant-Garde&quot;. The magazine caused a scandal in Portuguese society because of its futuristic idealism. Only two issues of the magazine were published. A third one was prepared but never published, owing to the controversy surrounding the magazine and a lack of money. Today, &quot;Orpheu&quot; is known for being one of the finest and most important examples of Portuguese literature, and for introducing modernism in Portugal.

===Depression===
In July 1915, Sá-Carneiro returned to Paris by train. He planned, with Fernando Pessoa, to publish issue no. 3 of &quot;Orpheu&quot;, but his father and sponsor of the magazine, living in Mozambique at the time, refused to disburse more money. While World War I was in progress in the north of France, he left the university and started a relationship with a prostitute. A few months later, with growing financial problems and depression, Sá-Carneiro wrote a dramatic letter to Fernando Pessoa on March 31, 1916:

:&quot;Unless there occurs a miracle, next Monday, March (or even the day before), your friend Mário de Sá-Carneiro will take a strong dose of strychnine and disappear from this world.&quot;

Extremely unhappy with his life, he still delayed the suicide by almost one month. But, as he had proclaimed, at the age of 25 he killed himself. &quot;Orpheu&quot; nr.3 was never published.

==Work==
In 1910, he wrote his first play, &quot;Amizade&quot; (the title means friendship), in partnership with Tomás Cabreira Júnior.

On the 9th of January 1911, Tomás Cabreira Júnior fatally shot himself with a shotgun in the middle of the school&#x27;s playground, causing Sá-Carneiro to write the poem &quot;A um suicida&quot; (To a suicidal).

In 1912, he published &quot;Príncipio&quot;, a collection of novellas dedicated to his father.

In 1913, he published &quot;A Confissão de Lúcio&quot;, one of his most famous works. This novella has a story where the fantastic reigns and it&#x27;s a mirror to this age of &quot;Avant-garde&quot;.

In 1915, the work &quot;Céu em Fogo&quot;, that gathered twelve novellas, was published. This book reveals the obsessions and disturbances that Sá-Carneiro was living with at the time.

Sá-Carneiro&#x27;s first publication of poetry was &quot;Dispersão&quot;, published in 1913, which included twelve poems. He wrote another book, &quot;Indícios de Oiro&quot;, but it was not published until over twenty years after his death, in the magazine &quot;Presença&quot;. In 1946 these two books were published along with some of Sá-Carneiro&#x27;s poems in the &quot;Orpheu&quot; magazine as a unique book.

His literary influences include Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Cesário Verde and António Nobre.

English poet Ted Hughes translated three of his poems into English. American poet Sylvia Plath also admired his work, in particular his novel &quot;A Confissão de Lúcio&quot; (&quot;Lúcio&#x27;s Confession&quot;).

==Centennial Anniversary of Mário de Sá-Carneiro&#x27;s death==
The 100th anniversary of Mário de Sá-Carneiro&#x27;s death, on April 26, 2016, was highlighted in Portugal and abroad with a number of publications and events, such as the colloquium &quot;Sá-Carneiro et les autres&quot; (Paris), the exhibit &quot;Mil Anos Me Separam de Amanhã&quot; (Paredes de Coura), integrated in the festival Realizar-Poesia, an exhibit at the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal, titled &quot;Mário de Sá-Carneiro, &#x27;O Homem São Louco&#x27;&quot;, and a conference and audio-theatre at the Casa Fernando Pessoa.

<text>Not This August, also known as &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, is a Hugo Award shortlisted science fiction novel by Cyril M. Kornbluth. It was originally published in 1955 by Doubleday. It was serialized in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine (Canada) in May and June 1955. A revised edition with a new foreword and afterword by Frederik Pohl was published in 1981 by Tor Books, . The title comes from author Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the Next War&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In 1965, the United States and Canada have been at war with the Soviet Union and the Chinese People&#x27;s Republic for three years. Both sides&#x27; atomic weapons are ineffective as surface-to-air missiles shoot down any bombers or guided missiles, so ground forces have done most of the fighting. The Communist nations—whose armies vastly outnumber the North Americans—conquered Western Europe, invaded South America, and are moving toward Texas. All American males must perform agricultural work to feed the armed forces or be drafted into military, construction, or factory service. Food, electricity, and gasoline are rationed, only two CONELRAD stations broadcast on radio, and New York City is reportedly under martial law.

Billy Justin, a 37-year-old commercial artist, and Korean War veteran, is working as a dairy farmer in Chiunga County, New York, when the radio announces that Soviet and Chinese forces have overrun the Canadian-American line at El Paso, Texas. In New Mexico, the Communist armies capture the Los Alamos National Laboratory and destroy the incomplete &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, a satellite capable of dropping hydrogen bombs from orbit that are impossible to shoot down.

The President of the United States surrenders to the Communists, who over the next several months partition the country at the Mississippi River and set up a joint puppet state, the North American People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. Other than a military garrison, disarmament of the civilian population, searches for fissionable material, and establishing production quotas for food, the surrender of the United States leaves Chiunga Center largely untouched. The Soviets execute local fifth column members who had secretly aided the invasion to prevent them from organizing against the new government but are otherwise relatively peaceful and amenable to the black market.

A paraplegic comes to Justin&#x27;s farm asking for work; he is General Hollerith, a veteran of the previous war. He and Justin join a conspiracy to finish the real satellite, a crewed space station buried in Chiunga County that the United States had been building for 15 years. It requires parts and engineering knowledge to launch. MVD troops arrive, shoot the corrupt Soviet soldiers, and are much more cruel. To Justin&#x27;s knowledge, they capture all of the conspirators but himself and the general.

Justin deduces that the contacts he needs to make are in Washington, Pennsylvania. With a traveling preacher, Sparhawk, Justin walks hundreds of miles from Chiunga Center to Washington, benefiting from the Democratic Republic&#x27;s policy of respecting the Americans&#x27; freedom of religion. At Washington, Justin receives instructions from the nationwide resistance movement for an attack planned for Christmas Eve on Chiunga Center to liberate the satellite.

Despite the Soviets&#x27; arrest and torture of a local farmer, they are ignorant of what &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, a mild oath they have heard sworn by various citizens, means until the battle begins. Coordinated by Hollerith, bridges around the area are blown up, and nearby arsenals are sabotaged. The townspeople, many of whom are veterans, battle the Soviets as the space station launches.

Hollerith&#x27;s forces triumph and the Americans transmit an ultimatum to the Soviets and Chinese: The satellite is armed and will destroy Moscow and Peking in 24 hours if occupation forces do not withdraw from American soil and free all prisoners of war. Hollerith offers Justin important positions in the new government and society, but he refuses them and kneels in prayer with Sparhawk, fearing the fulfillment of mutual assured destruction.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as &quot;believable throughout and thoroughly frightening.&quot; The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; gave a positive review, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;The most shockingly realistic science fiction book since Orwell&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;1984&quot;&#x27;...&quot;

<text>Claude Roy Kirk Jr. (January 7, 1926 – September 28, 2011) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 36th governor of Florida from 1967 to 1971. A Republican for most his career, he was the first Republican governor of Florida since Reconstruction.

==Early life==
Kirk was born in San Bernardino, California. Claude R. Kirk Jr.&#x27;s father, Claude Kirk Sr. was a businessperson and later a governmental official in Alabama and Florida. He lived in Chicago, Illinois, and Montgomery, Alabama, where he attended Sidney Lanier High School. After graduating at age seventeen, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps reserve and rose to the rank of second lieutenant, having served stateside during World War II. He briefly attended Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, before he transferred to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Kirk was accepted at the University of Alabama School of Law in Tuscaloosa and graduated in 1949. He was recalled to the Marines for the Korean War and was initially assigned to the 1st Marine Division. He later served aboard the battleship USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; and was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1952.

==Business==
Kirk worked as an insurance salesman and sold building supplies before partnering with W. Ashley Verlander in 1956 to start the &quot;American Heritage Life Insurance Company&quot; in Jacksonville, Florida. He had very little money of his own, so he recruited investors and his brother-in-law to bankroll the venture. The firm catered to the wealthy and quickly became one of the most successful in the industry, earning Kirk a fortune. Six years later, he left American Heritage Life and purchased a partnership in the New York securities firm, Hayden Stone, selling investments to Floridians.

==Early political career==

In 1960, Kirk switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and headed the &quot;Floridians for Nixon&quot; campaign, which helped the Republican Party win the state&#x27;s then ten electoral votes for the third consecutive time.

In 1964, Kirk ran as a Republican against veteran Democratic US Senator Spessard Holland, a former governor and epitome of the Florida Democratic establishment. He was considered a placeholder on the ballot, with Republican presidential nominee Barry M. Goldwater losing Florida to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Kirk polled 36.1 percent of the vote.

Thereafter, Kirk became embroiled in an intraparty squabble with US Representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg. Cramer recalled Kirk having &quot;begged me&quot; to allow him to address meetings held during the 1964 delegate and national committeeman races. Thus, Kirk became acquainted with Republican activists who could be helpful to him his later career.

==Governor==

In 1966, Kirk ran for governor and defeated the Democratic candidate, Robert King High, the mayor of Miami. High had unseated incumbent governor Haydon Burns, a Conservative Democrat, in the Democratic primary. In the general election, Kirk won a majority of the vote in 56 of the state&#x27;s 67 counties.

One of the major themes of Kirk&#x27;s campaign was his strong support for capital punishment, in contrast to Collins&#x27;, Bryant&#x27;s and Burns&#x27; opposition to capital punishment. Kirk promised to resume executions (the last had taken place in Florida in 1964), but no executions occurred during his administration, mostly because of an informal nationwide moratorium. Kirk made headlines when, during the campaign, he visited Florida State Prison and, after shaking hands with several death row inmates, said, &quot;If I&#x27;m elected, I may have to sign your death warrants.&quot;
Burns&#x27;s refusal to support High was a major factor in Kirk&#x27;s decisive victory in the general election. Upon taking the oath of office on January 3, 1967, he became the state&#x27;s first Republican governor in 90 years. During his four-year term in office, Kirk help shepherd a new Florida Constitution bringing Florida into the modern era in 1968. Although he had a Democratic-controlled legislature and Cabinet, Democrats did not have a veto-proof majority during Kirk&#x27;s term of office. The governor was often at odds with both Democrats and his Republican colleagues in the legislature on issues such as growth and taxes. He earned the nickname &quot;Claudius Maximus&quot; because of his brash, acerbic style of leadership and opinionated, colorful personality. In May 1967, in response to lobbying from the Walt Disney Company, Kirk signed into law legislation which created the Reedy Creek Improvement District and granted the Walt Disney Company self-governing status near the area where Walt Disney World was being constructed. During 1967, a riot would occur in Tampa starting on June 11. Kirk himself would be involved with it and visited the city on numerous occasions.

During 1968, there would be a statewide teachers strike in Florida. The Florida Education Association (FEA), a union for teachers in the state wanted to increase salaries along with school budgets during the 1967 legislature session. Kirk would call a special session for the legislature during January 1968 to try an address a crisis that was forming. The Senate would draft a bill that was at the level of the FEA&#x27;s desires but the House would reduce its size and a joint committee ended up passing the bill which the FEA thought was unacceptable. 35,000 teachers and school administrators would go on strike starting on February 19. Most schools would stay open and Florida&#x27;s Commissioner of Education, Floyd T. Christian would use substitute teachers as replacements. The FEA and State Board of Education would end up reaching an agreement and decided that $10.2 million would be decided for educational spending. FEA would end the strike the following day and teachers went back to work. The strike would be the first statewide teacher strike in the United States.

The Apollo 8 mission, which would take the first humans to lunar orbit, and the Apollo 11 mission, which would land the first humans on the Moon, would happen during his tenure. The rocket that carried the Apollo 11 astronauts would be launched at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 1969. Prior to launching, Kirk would issue a news release urging observers of the launch to drive safely around the launch area. During the 1960s and 70s, a drink named Tang would become popular due to its association with the US space program. Orange growers in Florida would be spooked by the success of Tang, which led to the Florida Citrus Commission filing several complaints with the Federal Trade Commission. This would lead to Kirk getting angry and in 1971 he would tell state agencies to cease purchasing from Tang&#x27;s owner, General Foods. He was reported to say once in regards to it: &quot;Why doesn’t Tang attack milk?&quot;

During Kirk&#x27;s term, the Dade County Port Authority began secretly buying land in the Everglades to build an airport. Governor Kirk turned a ceremonial shovel of dirt at the groundbreaking. Kirk was a strong supporter of what would have been the world&#x27;s largest airport despite evidence that it would destroy the water-recharge area South Florida needed. His transportation secretary, Michael O&#x27;Neil, stated, &quot;I call the Everglades a swamp. My children can&#x27;t play in it.&quot; The work was ultimately halted on September 17, 1969, after an Interior Department study ordered by Nixon.

Kirk&#x27;s management style was described as flamboyant and confrontational. He especially opposed court-ordered mandatory busing. In 1970, as he geared for a reelection bid, he tried to halt a desegregation busing plan in the Manatee County School District. He would arrive in Bradenton (the county seat) on April 6 and suspended the district superintendent, Dr. Jack Davidson along with the school board in an attempt to stop halt it. He would threaten a federal judge and stated that he wouldn&#x27;t sign busing students checks. US District Judge, Ben Krentzman would order that Kirk appear in court under the charge of contempt of court charge which he refused. The superintendent and school board members would be reinstated on April 8. Claude would end up staying inside the school board administration building for a week until being threatened by a $10,000 per day fine before leaving the building to return to Tallahassee. He quipped that the pro-busing judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, were &quot;drinking in the French Quarter and reading dirty books&quot;.

After the publication of John Filo&#x27;s photograph showing Mary Ann Vecchio of Florida kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller at the Kent State University shootings on May 4, 1970, then Governor Kirk publicly labeled Vecchio a dissident &quot;Communist&quot;.

==Feud with Cramer==

The schism between Cramer and Kirk accelerated in 1966 to the point that in a 1988 interview, Kirk said that he could not recall Cramer having rendered him any assistance at all in either the 1964 or 1966 campaigns: &quot;Cramer never helped me do anything. At all times he was a total combatant.&quot;
Kirk claimed that Cramer wanted the 1966 gubernatorial nomination himself after Burns, the primary loser, refused to endorse Mayor High, an ally of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York. Kirk said that Cramer&#x27;s legislative assistant, Jack P. Inscoe, later a real estate developer from Tampa, could verify that Cramer had asked Kirk to bow out of the race with High. Kirk claimed that the three met &quot;in a car ... probably in Palm Beach County&quot;. Inscoe said: &quot;This never happened. Kirk is not known for telling too much truth.&quot; Though Cramer said that he had no ambition to be governor, Kirk retorted, &quot;How could I have brought this up if it didn&#x27;t happen?&quot;
Cramer said that he subsequently urged Kirk to merge his own organization into the regular party structure in Cramer&#x27;s home county of Pinellas. However, Kirk maintained a separate entity in the hope of maximizing crossover support from conservative Democrats unhappy with the nomination of Mayor High. Cramer recalled this disagreement over strategy as the &quot;first indication that Kirk intended to do his own thing and attempt to form his own organization within the Republican Party in Florida. I didn&#x27;t get the signal at the time, but it became very obvious later, particularly when he attempted to defeat me as national committeeman in 1968.&quot;
Kirk asked the representative and later Senator Edward Gurney of Winter Park serve as chairman of the 1967 gubernatorial inauguration although Gurney had not been involved in the Kirk campaign. By contrast, Cramer was not even asked to serve on the inaugural committee. In 1968, Governor Kirk dispatched his staff to the Republican state convention in Orlando to push for Cramer&#x27;s ouster as national committeeman. Kirk justified his move against Cramer: &quot;I wanted my own man. After all, I was the leader of the party. If Cramer had been the leader of the party, he would have wanted his own man too.&quot; Cramer said that Kirk was attempting to be &quot;not only the governor but the king of the party, and I was about the only person at the time who stood in his way from taking total control.&quot;
Despite Kirk&#x27;s opposition, Cramer attributed his retention in 1968 as national committeeman to the loyalty of organizational Republicans: &quot;I had proved myself an effective congressman. I was on the House leadership as vice chairman of the Republican Conference and was ranking member on the then named House Public Works Committee.&quot;
In 1988, Cramer recalled a visit 21 years earlier to Kirk&#x27;s office when a former state legislator was denied an appointment with the governor even though the man was a stalwart Republican. According to Cramer, &quot;Kirk made it very clear that he got a great deal of joy in making sure that this guy didn&#x27;t get an appointment. ... He just loved to kick people in the teeth to show how much power he had.&quot;

Despite observing this incident, Cramer said that party unity led him to avoid public criticism of Kirk. Cramer viewed Kirk as &quot;his own worst enemy&quot;. Kirk claimed that he had never had a &quot;serious discussion&quot; on any topic with Cramer. Walter Wurfel, a Floridian who was later U.S. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s deputy press secretary, termed Kirk&#x27;s election in 1966 as &quot;the worst thing that could have happened to the Republicans. He wasn&#x27;t interested in the Republican Party; party was a matter of convenience for him.&quot;
Cramer said he believed that Kirk may have become vice president or even president had he tended to his gubernatorial duties rather than openly seeking the second position. Eyeing the vice presidency in 1968, Kirk stood alone in the Florida delegation at the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach by supporting Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, rather than the clear frontrunner, Richard Nixon. Cramer said that Nixon may have selected Kirk, rather than Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland for the second slot had Kirk concentrated on his duties of office. Kirk claimed that it &quot;had been agreed&quot; that he would run with either Rockefeller or Nixon, but Nixon chose Agnew in the hope of enhancing campaign contributions from Greek American businessmen.

==Defeat==
In 1970, Kirk was challenged in the primary by drug store magnate Jack Eckerd of Clearwater and state senator and later US Representative L. A. &quot;Skip&quot; Bafalis. Eckerd said that though he had supported Kirk in 1966, he became disappointed and embarrassed with Kirk: &quot;I was offended by his public behavior and chagrined that he was a Republican.&quot;

With no candidate getting 50%, Kirk and Eckerd met in a runoff, which Kirk won. The challenges strained Kirk and used up campaign funds. Despite Kirk&#x27;s tactics, Eckerd said &quot;time heals all wounds, and now I chuckle about it.&quot; He added that his defeat in 1970 probably prolonged his life.

In the general election, Kirk lost 57%-43% to Democrat state senator Reubin O&#x27;Donovan Askew, from Pensacola. In that same 1970 general election, William Cramer, Kirk&#x27;s intraparty nemesis, lost to Democrat Lawton Chiles (himself a future Florida governor) of Lakeland for the U.S. Senate seat that Spessard Holland finally vacated. Cramer had defeated Kirk&#x27;s preferred Senate choice, Fifth Circuit Court Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee.

When Kirk&#x27;s term of office ended on January 5, 1971, he returned to his business pursuits. In the 1978 Florida gubernatorial election, Kirk ran as a Democrat. He competed in the 1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and the 1988 United States Senate election in Florida. Returning to the Republican Party, Kirk was nominated by the party for Florida commissioner of education in 1990.

==Personal life==
Kirk met Sarah Stokes while he was in law school. Her family owned an automobile dealership, and the couple married in 1947. They were divorced in 1950, but remarried in 1951. The union produced four children: two daughters, Sarah and Kitty, and twin sons Frank and Will. They divorced for the final time in 1966. In a 1967 interview, Sarah Stokes commented that Kirk &quot;drinks to excess quite often (and) has indiscreet public associations with other women&quot;.

A divorcee when he took office, Kirk, then 41, married German-born Erika Mattfeld, 33, on February 18, 1967. She was an actress whom he had met during an unsuccessful business venture in Brazil. From his final marriage he had two daughters and a son.

Kirk&#x27;s daughter Kitty married Ander Crenshaw, a former U.S. Representative from Florida&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

In February 2011, Kirk survived a mild heart attack. He died in his sleep on September 28, 2011.

==In popular culture==

In an episode of &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-in&quot;, Dan Rowan asked the rhetorical questions: &quot;Did you read about Governor Kirk down in Florida? He says that he would rather go to prison than accept school integration. Now, I wonder what he&#x27;ll do when he finds out that the prisons are already integrated?&quot;

<text>In electronics and computing, a soft error is a type of error where a signal or datum is wrong. Errors may be caused by a , usually understood either to be a mistake in design or construction, or a broken component. A soft error is also a signal or datum which is wrong, but is not assumed to imply such a mistake or breakage. After observing a soft error, there is no implication that the system is any less reliable than before. One cause of soft errors is single event upsets from cosmic rays.

In a computer&#x27;s memory system, a soft error changes an instruction in a program or a data value. Soft errors typically can be remedied by cold booting the computer. A soft error will not damage a system&#x27;s hardware; the only damage is to the data that is being processed.

There are two types of soft errors, &quot;chip-level soft error&quot; and &quot;system-level soft error&quot;. Chip-level soft errors occur when particles hit the chip, e.g., when secondary particles from cosmic rays land on the silicon die. If a particle with certain properties hits a memory cell it can cause the cell to change state to a different value. The atomic reaction in this example is so tiny that it does not damage the physical structure of the chip. System-level soft errors occur when the data being processed is hit with a noise phenomenon, typically when the data is on a data bus. The computer tries to interpret the noise as a data bit, which can cause errors in addressing or processing program code. The bad data bit can even be saved in memory and cause problems at a later time.

If detected, a soft error may be corrected by rewriting correct data in place of erroneous data. Highly reliable systems use error correction to correct soft errors on the fly. However, in many systems, it may be impossible to determine the correct data, or even to discover that an error is present at all. In addition, before the correction can occur, the system may have crashed, in which case the recovery procedure must include a reboot. Soft errors involve changes to datathe electrons in a storage circuit, for examplebut not changes to the physical circuit itself, the atoms. If the data is rewritten, the circuit will work perfectly again. Soft errors can occur on transmission lines, in digital logic, analog circuits, magnetic storage, and elsewhere, but are most commonly known in semiconductor storage.

== Critical charge ==
Whether or not a circuit experiences a soft error depends on the energy of the incoming particle, the geometry of the impact, the location of the strike, and the design of the logic circuit. Logic circuits with higher capacitance and higher logic voltages are less likely to suffer an error. This combination of capacitance and voltage is described by the &quot;critical charge&quot; parameter, Qcrit, the minimum electron charge disturbance needed to change the logic level. A higher Qcrit means fewer soft errors. Unfortunately, a higher Qcrit also means a slower logic gate and a higher power dissipation. Reduction in chip feature size and supply voltage, desirable for many reasons, decreases Qcrit. Thus, the importance of soft errors increases as chip technology advances.

In a logic circuit, Qcrit is defined as the minimum amount of induced charge required at a circuit node to cause a voltage pulse to propagate from that node to the output and be of sufficient duration and magnitude to be reliably latched. Since a logic circuit contains many nodes that may be struck, and each node may be of unique capacitance and distance from output, Qcrit is typically characterized on a per-node basis.

== Causes of soft errors ==

=== Alpha particles from package decay ===
Soft errors became widely known with the introduction of dynamic RAM in the 1970s. In these early devices, ceramic chip packaging materials contained small amounts of radioactive contaminants. Very low decay rates are needed to avoid excess soft errors, and chip companies have occasionally suffered problems with contamination ever since. It is extremely hard to maintain the material purity needed. Controlling alpha particle emission rates for critical packaging materials to less than a level of 0.001 counts per hour per cm2 (cph/cm2) is required for reliable performance of most circuits. For comparison, the count rate of a typical shoe&#x27;s sole is between 0.1 and 10 cph/cm2.

Package radioactive decay usually causes a soft error by alpha particle emission. The positive charged alpha particle travels through the semiconductor and disturbs the distribution of electrons there. If the disturbance is large enough, a digital signal can change from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. In combinational logic, this effect is transient, perhaps lasting a fraction of a nanosecond, and this has led to the challenge of soft errors in combinational logic mostly going unnoticed. In sequential logic such as latches and RAM, even this transient upset can become stored for an indefinite time, to be read out later. Thus, designers are usually much more aware of the problem in storage circuits.

A 2011 Black Hat paper discusses the real-life security implications of such bit-flips in the Internet&#x27;s Domain Name System. The paper found up to 3,434 incorrect requests per day due to bit-flip changes for various common domains. Many of these bit-flips would probably be attributable to hardware problems, but some could be attributed to alpha particles. These bit-flip errors may be taken advantage of by malicious actors in the form of bitsquatting.

Isaac Asimov received a letter congratulating him on an accidental prediction of alpha-particle RAM errors in a 1950s novel.

=== Cosmic rays creating energetic neutrons and protons ===
Once the electronics industry had determined how to control package contaminants, it became clear that other causes were also at work. James F. Ziegler led a program of work at IBM which culminated in the publication of a number of papers (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979) demonstrating that cosmic rays also could cause soft errors. Indeed, in modern devices, cosmic rays may be the predominant cause. Although the primary particle of the cosmic ray does not generally reach the Earth&#x27;s surface, it creates a shower of energetic secondary particles. At the Earth&#x27;s surface approximately 95% of the particles capable of causing soft errors are energetic neutrons with the remainder composed of protons and pions.
IBM estimated in 1996 that one error per month per 256 MiB of RAM was expected for a desktop computer.
This flux of energetic neutrons is typically referred to as &quot;cosmic rays&quot; in the soft error literature. Neutrons are uncharged and cannot disturb a circuit on their own, but undergo neutron capture by the nucleus of an atom in a chip. This process may result in the production of charged secondaries, such as alpha particles and oxygen nuclei, which can then cause soft errors.

Cosmic ray flux depends on altitude. For the common reference location of 40.7° N, 74° W at sea level (New York City, NY, USA), the flux is approximately 14 neutrons/cm2/hour. Burying a system in a cave reduces the rate of cosmic-ray-induced soft errors to a negligible level. In the lower levels of the atmosphere, the flux increases by a factor of about 2.2 for every 1000 m (1.3 for every 1000 ft) increase in altitude above sea level. Computers operated on top of mountains experience an order of magnitude higher rate of soft errors compared to sea level. The rate of upsets in aircraft may be more than 300 times the sea level upset rate. This is in contrast to package decay-induced soft errors, which do not change with location.
As chip density increases, Intel expects the errors caused by cosmic rays to increase and become a limiting factor in design.

The average rate of cosmic-ray soft errors is &quot;inversely&quot; proportional to sunspot activity. That is, the average number of cosmic-ray soft errors decreases during the active portion of the sunspot cycle and increases during the quiet portion. This counter-intuitive result occurs for two reasons. The Sun does not generally produce cosmic ray particles with energy above 1 GeV that are capable of penetrating to the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and creating particle showers, so the changes in the solar flux do not directly influence the number of errors. Further, the increase in the solar flux during an active sun period does have the effect of reshaping the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field providing some additional shielding against higher energy cosmic rays, resulting in a decrease in the number of particles creating showers. The effect is fairly small in any case resulting in a ±7% modulation of the energetic neutron flux in New York City. Other locations are similarly affected.

One experiment measured the soft error rate at the sea level to be 5,950 failures in time (FIT = failures per billion hours) per DRAM chip. When the same test setup was moved to an underground vault, shielded by over of rock that effectively eliminated all cosmic rays, zero soft errors were recorded. In this test, all other causes of soft errors are too small to be measured, compared to the error rate caused by cosmic rays.
Energetic neutrons produced by cosmic rays may lose most of their kinetic energy and reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings as they are scattered by materials. The resulting neutrons are simply referred to as thermal neutrons and have an average kinetic energy of about 25 millielectron-volts at 25 °C. Thermal neutrons are also produced by environmental radiation sources, including the decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium. The thermal neutron flux from sources other than cosmic-ray showers may still be noticeable in an underground location and an important contributor to soft errors for some circuits.

=== Thermal neutrons ===
Neutrons that have lost kinetic energy until they are in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings are an important cause of soft errors for some circuits. At low energies many neutron capture reactions become much more probable and result in fission of certain materials creating charged secondaries as fission byproducts. For some circuits the capture of a thermal neutron by the nucleus of the 10B isotope of boron is particularly important. This nuclear reaction is an efficient producer of an alpha particle, 7Li nucleus and gamma ray. Either of the charged particles (alpha or 7Li) may cause a soft error if produced in very close proximity, approximately 5 μm, to a critical circuit node. The capture cross section for 11B is 6 orders of magnitude smaller and does not contribute to soft errors.

Boron has been used in BPSG, the insulator in the interconnection layers of integrated circuits, particularly in the lowest one. The inclusion of boron lowers the melt temperature of the glass providing better reflow and planarization characteristics. In this application the glass is formulated with a boron content of 4% to 5% by weight. Naturally occurring boron is 20% 10B with the remainder the 11B isotope. Soft errors are caused by the high level of 10B in this critical lower layer of some older integrated circuit processes. Boron-11, used at low concentrations as a p-type dopant, does not contribute to soft errors. Integrated circuit manufacturers eliminated borated dielectrics by the time individual circuit components decreased in size to 150 nm, largely due to this problem.

In critical designs, depleted boronconsisting almost entirely of boron-11is used, to avoid this effect and therefore to reduce the soft error rate. Boron-11 is a by-product of the nuclear industry.

For applications in medical electronic devices this soft error mechanism may be extremely important. Neutrons are produced during high-energy cancer radiation therapy using photon beam energies above 10 MeV. These neutrons are moderated as they are scattered from the equipment and walls in the treatment room resulting in a thermal neutron flux that is about 40 × 106 higher than the normal environmental neutron flux. This high thermal neutron flux will generally result in a very high rate of soft errors and consequent circuit upset.

=== Other causes ===
Soft errors can also be caused by random noise or signal integrity problems, such as inductive or capacitive crosstalk. However, in general, these sources represent a small contribution to the overall soft error rate when compared to radiation effects.

Some tests conclude that the isolation of DRAM memory cells can be circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to adjacent cells. Thus, accessing data stored in DRAM causes memory cells to leak their charges and interact electrically, as a result of high cells density in modern memory, altering the content of nearby memory rows that actually were not addressed in the original memory access. This effect is known as row hammer, and it has also been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits.

== Designing around soft errors ==

=== Soft error mitigation===
A designer can attempt to minimize the rate of soft errors by judicious device design, choosing the right semiconductor, package and substrate materials, and the right device geometry. Often, however, this is limited by the need to reduce device size and voltage, to increase operating speed and to reduce power dissipation. The susceptibility of devices to upsets is described in the industry using the JEDEC JESD-89 standard.

One technique that can be used to reduce the soft error rate in digital circuits is called radiation hardening. This involves increasing the
capacitance at selected circuit nodes in order to increase its effective Qcrit value. This reduces the range of particle energies
to which the logic value of the node can be upset. Radiation hardening is often accomplished by increasing the size of transistors who share
a drain/source region at the node. Since the area and power overhead of radiation hardening can be restrictive to design, the technique is often applied selectively to nodes which are predicted to have the highest probability of resulting in soft errors if struck. Tools and models that can
predict which nodes are most vulnerable are the subject of past and current research in the area of soft errors.

=== Detecting soft errors===
There has been work addressing soft errors in processor and memory resources using both hardware and software techniques. Several research efforts addressed soft errors by proposing error detection and recovery via hardware-based redundant multi-threading.
These approaches used special hardware to replicate an application execution to identify errors in the output, which increased hardware design complexity and cost including high performance overhead. Software-based soft error tolerant schemes, on the other hand, are flexible and can be applied on commercial off-the-shelf microprocessors. Many works propose compiler-level instruction replication and result checking for soft error detection.


=== Correcting soft errors ===
Designers can choose to accept that soft errors will occur, and design systems with appropriate error detection and correction to recover gracefully. Typically, a semiconductor memory design might use forward error correction, incorporating redundant data into each word to create an error correcting code. Alternatively, roll-back error correction can be used, detecting the soft error with an error-detecting code such as parity, and rewriting correct data from another source. This technique is often used for write-through cache memories.

Soft errors in logic circuits are sometimes detected and corrected using the techniques of fault tolerant design. These often include the use of redundant circuitry or computation of data, and typically come at the cost of circuit area, decreased performance, and/or higher power consumption. The concept of triple modular redundancy (TMR) can be employed to ensure very high soft-error reliability in logic circuits. In this technique, three identical copies of a circuit compute on the same data in parallel and outputs are fed into majority voting logic, returning the value that occurred in at least two of three cases. In this way, the failure of one circuit due to soft error is discarded assuming the other two circuits operated correctly. In practice, however, few designers can afford the greater than 200% circuit area and power overhead required, so it is usually only selectively applied. Another common concept to correct soft errors in logic circuits is temporal (or time) redundancy, in which one circuit operates on the same data multiple times and compares subsequent evaluations for consistency. This approach, however, often incurs performance overhead, area overhead (if copies of latches are used to store data), and power overhead, though is considerably more area-efficient than modular redundancy.

Traditionally, DRAM has had the most attention in the quest to reduce or work around soft errors, due to the fact that DRAM has comprised the majority-share of susceptible device surface area in desktop, and server computer systems (ref. the prevalence of ECC RAM in server computers). Hard figures for DRAM susceptibility are hard to come by, and vary considerably across designs, fabrication processes, and manufacturers. 1980s technology 256 kilobit DRAMS could have clusters of five or six bits flip from a single alpha particle. Modern DRAMs have much smaller feature sizes, so the deposition of a similar amount of charge could easily cause many more bits to flip.

The design of error detection and correction circuits is helped by the fact that soft errors usually are localised to a very small area of a chip. Usually, only one cell of a memory is affected, although high energy events can cause a multi-cell upset. Conventional memory layout usually places one bit of many different correction words adjacent on a chip. So, even a &quot;multi-cell upset&quot; leads to only a number of separate &quot;single-bit upsets&quot; in multiple correction words, rather than a &quot;multi-bit upset&quot; in a single correction word. So, an error correcting code needs only to cope with a single bit in error in each correction word in order to cope with all likely soft errors. The term &#x27;multi-cell&#x27; is used for upsets affecting multiple cells of a memory, whatever correction words those cells happen to fall in. &#x27;Multi-bit&#x27; is used when multiple bits in a single correction word are in error.

== Soft errors in combinational logic ==
The three natural masking effects in combinational logic that determine whether
a single event upset (SEU) will propagate to become a soft error are electrical masking, logical masking, and temporal (or timing-window) masking. An SEU is &quot;logically masked&quot; if its
propagation is blocked from reaching an output latch because off-path gate
inputs prevent a logical transition of that gate&#x27;s output. An SEU is 
&quot;electrically masked&quot; if the signal is attenuated by the electrical properties of
gates on its propagation path such that the resulting pulse is of insufficient magnitude to be
reliably latched. An SEU is &quot;temporally masked&quot; if the erroneous pulse reaches
an output latch, but it does not occur close enough to when the latch is actually triggered to hold.

If all three masking effects fail to occur, the propagated pulse becomes latched and the output of the logic circuit will be an erroneous value. In the context of circuit operation, this erroneous output value may be considered a soft error event. However, from a microarchitectural-level standpoint, the affected result may not change the output of the currently-executing program. For instance, the erroneous data could be overwritten before use, masked in subsequent logic operations, or simply never be used. If erroneous data does not affect the output of a program, it is considered to be an example of &quot;microarchitectural masking&quot;.

== Soft error rate ==
Soft error rate (SER) is the rate at which a device or system encounters or is predicted to encounter soft errors. It is typically expressed as either the number of failures-in-time (FIT) or mean time between failures (MTBF). The unit adopted for quantifying failures in time is called FIT, which is equivalent to one error per billion hours of device operation. MTBF is usually given in years of device operation; to put it into perspective, one FIT equals to approximately 1,000,000,000 / (24 × 365.25) = 114,077 times longer between errors than one-year MTBF.

While many electronic systems have an MTBF that exceeds the expected lifetime of the circuit, the SER may still be unacceptable to the manufacturer or customer. For instance, many failures per million circuits due to soft errors can be expected in the field if the system does not have adequate soft error protection. The failure of even a few products in the field, particularly if catastrophic, can tarnish the reputation of the product and company that designed it. Also, in safety- or cost-critical applications where the cost of system failure far outweighs the cost of the system itself, a 1% risk of soft error failure per lifetime may be too high to be acceptable to the customer. Therefore, it is advantageous to design for low SER when manufacturing a system in high-volume or requiring extremely high reliability.

<doc id="1155601" wikidata="Q449734" url="?curid=1155601" title="Elaine Morgan">
<text>Elaine Morgan OBE, FRSL (7 November 1920 – 12 July 2013), was a Welsh writer for television and the author of several books on evolutionary anthropology. She advocated the aquatic ape hypothesis, which advocated as a corrective to what she saw as theories that purveyed gendered stereotypes and failed to account for women&#x27;s role in human evolution adequately. &quot;The Descent of Woman&quot;, published in 1972, became an international bestseller, translated into ten languages. In 2016, she was named one of &quot;the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time&quot; in a press survey.

==Personal life==
Elaine Floyd was born and brought up in Hopkinstown, near Pontypridd, in Wales. Her father was a coal miner. She lived for many years until her death, in Mountain Ash, near Aberdare. She graduated from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, with a degree in English. She married Morien Morgan, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who died in 1997, and they had three sons, the oldest being Dylan Morgan.

==Writing==
Elaine Morgan began writing in the 1950s after winning a competition in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, successfully publishing, then joining the BBC when it began to produce her plays for television. Her works included popular dramas, newspaper columns, and a series of publications on evolutionary anthropology. Her first book, &quot;The Descent of Woman&quot;, published in 1972, became an international bestseller translated into ten languages. The book drew attention to what she saw as sexism inherent in the prevalent savannah-based &quot;killer ape&quot; theories of human evolution as presented in popular anthropological works by Robert Ardrey, Lionel Tiger and others. She argued that such &quot;Tarzanist&quot; anthropological narratives purveyed gendered stereotypes of women that failed to adequately account for women&#x27;s role in human evolution. &quot;The Aquatic Ape&quot; (1982), &quot;The Scars of Evolution&quot; (1990), &quot;The Descent of the Child&quot; (1994), &quot;The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Naked Darwinist&quot; (2008) all explored her alternative account of human evolution in more detail.

She also published &quot;Falling Apart: the Rise and Decline of Urban Civilization&quot; in 1976, and in 2005 &quot;Pinker&#x27;s List&quot;, a critique of Steven Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;.

Morgan wrote for many television series, including the adaptations of &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1975), &quot;Off to Philadelphia in the Morning&quot; (1978) and &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (1979). Her other work included episodes of &quot;Dr. Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; (1963–1970), the biographical drama &quot;The Life and Times of David Lloyd George&quot; (1981) and contributions to the &quot;Campion&quot; (1989) series.

She won two BAFTAs and two Writers&#x27; Guild awards. She also wrote the script for the &quot;Horizon&quot; documentary about the disabled fund-raiser Joey Deacon, winning the Prix Italia in 1975. She was honoured with the Writer of the Year Award from the Royal Television Society for her serialisation of Vera Brittain&#x27;s &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (1979).

In 2003 Morgan started a weekly column for the Welsh daily &quot;The Western Mail&quot;, which won her the 2011 Columnist of the Year award in the Society of Editors&#x27; Regional Press Awards.

She was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Glamorgan University in December 2006, an honorary fellowship of the University of Cardiff in 2007, and the Letten F. Saugstad Prize for her &quot;contribution to scientific knowledge&quot;.

Morgan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours for services to literature and education. She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature the same year, and an honorary freeman of Rhondda Cynon Taf in April 2013.

==Aquatic ape hypothesis==
Morgan has promoted a version of the aquatic ape hypothesis, which proposes that human evolution had an &quot;aquatic phase&quot; in the Miocene or Pliocene epoch.

Although Morgan&#x27;s aquatic ape hypothesis has been debunked by the anthropology and scientific community, and is classified as a pseudoscience, it has achieved popular appeal since the publication of &quot;Descent of Woman&quot; in 1972.

Morgan&#x27;s work has received warm comments from several prominent people. Philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote of the criticisms of her:

And in a BBC/Discovery Channel Documentary, the South African anthropologist Phillip V. Tobias said:

In 2000 Morgan was awarded the Letten F Saugstad prize in Oslo for her &quot;contribution to scientific knowledge&quot; and in December 2008 she was admitted as a Fellow of the Linnean Society, following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.

==Death and legacy==
Morgan died at the age of 92 on 12 July 2013. Welsh author Trevor Fishlock described her in an obituary as a writer &quot;who brought out the flavour of Wales.&quot;

In 2019, Morgan was one of five women on a shortlist for a Cardiff statue.

In 2020, to commemorate the centenary of her birth, two complementary biographies of her life were published. The Welsh historian Daryl Leeworthy wrote one focusing on her earlier career as a writer and Algis Kuliukas wrote one emphasising more her &quot;aquatic ape&quot; work.

On 18 March 2022 a statue of her by Emma Rodgers was installed outside the Tŷ Calon Lân Medical Centre in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf, as part of the Monumental Welsh Women project.

The author, Bruce Lindsay, states in his biography of Scottish poet Ivor Cutler that Cutler dedicated one of his poetry books, &quot;Is that your flap, Jack?&quot; to Morgan saying: &quot;With deep gratitude to Elaine Morgan, author of &#x27;The Descent of Woman&#x27;, for changing my understanding of man&quot;.

While serving with B Company, 11th Engineer Battalion, 3rd Infantry Division in Baghdad, his team was attacked by a group of Iraqi soldiers and after a firefight he was killed by Iraqi fire. For his actions during this battle he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Two years later, the medal, along with the newly approved Medal of Honor flag, were presented to his family on behalf of him; specifically to his eleven-year-old son David, at a White House ceremony by President George W. Bush.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born on September 24, 1969, in El Paso, Texas, to Ivan Smith and Janice Pvirre, but when he was nine the family moved to Tampa, Florida. As a child he attended public schools and enjoyed sports, especially American football. He also liked riding skateboards and bicycles, playing pranks with his friends and younger sister Lisa. In high school he became interested in carpentry, even finding a part-time job as a carpenter&#x27;s assistant. He also liked to work on cars, especially old ones, and enjoyed taking things apart to see how they worked, even restoring a dune buggy with a friend. In 1989 he graduated from Tampa Bay Vocational Tech High School and shortly thereafter joined the United States Army in October 1989.

==Military career==
Smith attended Basic Training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, in 1989, before being sent to Germany for his first duty station, where he joined the 9th Engineer Battalion. Later, he served during the Gulf War. He deployed with B company in October 1996 as part of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the covering force for Operation Joint Endeavor and Operation Joint Guardian; the battalion returned to Schweinfurt in April 1997. In 1999 he was posted to the 11th Engineer Battalion, with which he was deployed to Kosovo in May 2001, where he was responsible for daily presence patrols in the town of Gnjilane. In the spring of 2002, he received a promotion to sergeant first class and completed the Advanced Non-Commissioned Officer Course in August 2002.

As part of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he was assigned to B Company, 11th Engineer Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division.

===Medal of Honor action===
Smith&#x27;s company was supporting the 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment as it made its way through the Karbala Gap, across the Euphrates River and to Saddam International Airport (BIAP) in Baghdad. On April 4, 2003, a 100-man force was assigned to block the highway between Baghdad and the airport, about one mile east of the airport. After a brief battle, several of the Iraqis were captured. Smith spotted a walled enclosure nearby with a tower overlooking it. He and his squad set about building an impromptu enemy prisoner of war (EPW) holding area in the enclosure. Smith and 16 other men used an Armored Combat Earthmover (similar to a bulldozer) to knock a hole in the south wall of the courtyard. On the north side, there was a metal gate that Smith assigned several men to guard. These men noticed 50–100 Iraqi soldiers who had taken positions in trenches just beyond the gate. He summoned a Bradley Fighting Vehicle to attack their position. Three nearby M113 armored personnel carriers came to support the attack. An M113 was hit, possibly by a mortar, and all three crewmen were wounded. The Bradley, damaged and running low on ammunition, withdrew to reload during a lull in the battle. Smith organized the evacuation of the injured M113 crewmen. However, behind the courtyard was a military aid station crowded with 100 combat casualties. To protect it from being overrun, Smith chose to fight on rather than withdraw with the wounded.

Meanwhile, some Iraqi soldiers had taken position in the tower overlooking the courtyard, just over the west wall. The Iraqis now had the Americans in the courtyard under an intense crossfire. Smith took command of the M113 and ordered a driver to position it so that he could attack both the tower and the trenches. He manned the M113&#x27;s machine gun, going through three boxes of ammunition. A separate team led by First Sergeant Tim Campbell attacked the tower from the rear, killing the Iraqis. As the battle ended, Smith&#x27;s machine gun fell silent. His comrades found him slumped in the turret hatch. His armored vest was peppered with 13 bullet holes, the vest&#x27;s ceramic armor inserts, both front and back, cracked in numerous places (the M113 he was manning was not fitted with protective ACAV gun shields which had been standard since the Vietnam War, later in the Iraq conflict, modern gunshields were fielded). However, the fatal shot, one of the last from the tower, had entered his neck and passed through his brain, killing him.

Before deploying to Iraq, Smith had written to his parents, saying &quot;There are two ways to come home, stepping off the plane and being carried off the plane. It doesn&#x27;t matter how I come home, because I am prepared to give all that I am to ensure that all my boys make it home.&quot; Smith was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Gulf of Mexico, where he loved to fish.

He has a memorial marker in Arlington National Cemetery Arlington, Virginia, and his marker can be found in memorial Section MD, lot 67. He also has a memorial at his high school outside of the school&#x27;s Navy Junior ROTC building.

At the time of his death Smith had served in the United States Army for thirteen years, and for his actions during the battle, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor. On April 4, 2005, exactly two years after he was killed, his eleven-year-old son David received the Medal of Honor on behalf of his father from President George W. Bush, along with a Medal of Honor flag.

Smith was survived by his wife Birgit, son David and stepdaughter Jessica.

<text>The Robert Moses Causeway is an state parkway in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island. It is named for the master builder and urban planner Robert Moses. The parkway, originally known as the Captree Causeway, connects West Islip on Long Island to the barrier beach islands, such as Captree Island, Jones Beach Island, and the western tip of Fire Island, to the south. It is designated New York State Route 908J (NY 908J), an unsigned reference route.

==Route description==
The Robert Moses Causeway begins inside Robert Moses State Park, located on the western tip of Fire Island. From here, the parkway heads north across the Fire Island Inlet on the Fire Island Inlet Bridge as a two-lane undivided road. On the north side of the inlet, the parkway becomes enters Captree State Park and approaches a cloverleaf interchange with Ocean Parkway. The parkway becomes a five-lane freeway with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes in the vicinity of the junction.

The parkway then traverses the State Boat Channel Bridge by way of a -long bascule bridge modeled after the Mill Basin Drawbridge in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. The north foot of the bridge contains an unnumbered interchange to a private road on Captree Island, where the rest of the road is surrounded by protected land. On the section that crosses over the Great South Bay, via the Great South Bay Bridge, the New York City skyline can be faintly seen on a clear day. Originally a toll bridge, the remnants of the former toll plaza for the Great South Bay Bridge can be found on the north side in West Islip. At the cloverleaf interchange with NY 27A, the third northbound lane becomes the deceleration ramp, and from there the rest of the parkway is four lanes wide.

The parkway soon takes a slight northeastern turn and later rises to move over Union Boulevard (County Route 50 or CR 50), the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, and Orinoco Drive with no access to either roads. Instead, another cloverleaf interchange is available at NY 27. The road remains elevated as it crosses over Muncey Road and then runs along the west side of Casamento Park, before approaching its northern terminus at the interchange with the Southern State Parkway. The north-to-eastbound ramp to the Southern State Parkway contains an interchange of its own with CR 57 (Bay Shore Road), because that ramp&#x27;s traffic misses the Southern State&#x27;s exit to CR 57. The other ramps exist on a partial cloverleaf just west of Bay Shore Road&#x27;s interchange with the Southern State.

==History==
The first sprawling trestle crossing from West Islip to Captree Island was completed in 1951. The structure is in length with a middle clearance for boats of . Originally, one lane was for southbound traffic and the other for northbound traffic. In a bridge opening ceremony, the first car to drive over the bridge was a Suffolk County Sheriff&#x27;s Office patrol vehicle. In 1967, a new span was built next to the original bridge, carrying three lanes of northbound traffic. The original bridge was reconfigured to carry southbound traffic.

The Fire Island Inlet span was completed in 1964. By 1985 a dual span was proposed to alleviate traffic, but it was never constructed. When first proposed in 1938, the span was to be a vertical-lift bridge with a design similar to that of the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge. Later, the design of the Fire Island Bridge was changed to conform with that of the Great South Bay span, a steel-arch span with a clearance.

<doc id="1155621" wikidata="Q1569360" url="?curid=1155621" title="Silverpoint">
<text>Silverpoint (one of several types of metalpoint) is a traditional drawing technique and tool first used by medieval scribes on manuscripts.

== History ==
A silverpoint drawing is made by dragging a silver rod or wire across a surface, often prepared with gesso or ground of Chinese white. Silverpoint is one of several types of metalpoint used by scribes, craftsmen and artists since ancient times. Metalpoint styli were used for writing on soft surfaces (wax or bark), ruling and underdrawing on parchment, and drawing on prepared paper and panel supports. For drawing purposes, the essential metals used were lead, tin and silver. The softness of these metals made them effective drawing instruments. Goldsmiths also used metalpoint drawings to prepare their detailed, meticulous designs. Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s father was one such craftsman who later taught his young son to draw in metalpoint, to such good effect that his 1484 &quot;Self-Portrait at the Age of 13&quot; is still considered a masterpiece.

In the late Gothic/early Renaissance era, silverpoint emerged as a fine line drawing technique. Not blunting as easily as lead or tin, and rendering precise detail, silverpoint was especially favored in Florentine and Flemish workshops. Silverpoint drawings of this era include model books and preparatory sheets for paintings. Artists who worked in silverpoint include Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer and Raphael. Cennino Cennini&#x27;s &quot;Il Libro dell&#x27;Arte&quot; provides a window on the practice of silver and leadpoint drawing, as well as preparing metalpoint grounds, in the late 14th century. Susan Dorothea White&#x27;s book &quot;Draw Like da Vinci&quot; describes the silverpoint technique of Leonardo da Vinci.

As noted by Francis Ames-Lewis, drawing styles changed at the end of the 16th century, resulting in a decline for metalpoint. The discovery of graphite deposits at Seathwaite in Borrowdale, Cumbria, England, in the early 1500s, and its increasing availability to artists in a pure, soft (and erasable) form hastened silverpoint&#x27;s eclipse. Artists sought more gestural qualities, for which graphite, red and black chalk were better suited. Ink and wash drawings are also prevalent in the period. In addition, these other drawing techniques required less effort and were more forgiving than silver, which resists erasure and leaves a fainter line. Furthermore, the preparation of silverpoint supports, usually with hide glue with finely ground bone ash, was labor-intensive. Modern practitioners use zinc, pre-prepared acrylic-based grounds or titanium white tempera or marble dust as a ground. Natural chalks and charcoal have the advantage of producing immediate results on uncoated papers.

Dutch artists Hendrick Goltzius and Rembrandt maintained the silverpoint tradition into the 17th century, as it declined in other parts of Europe. Rembrandt made several silverpoints on prepared vellum, the best-known being the portrait of his wife Saskia, 1633. Botanical artists and architects continued to use metalpoint because of its exact lines. However, artists who continued this tradition of fine line drawing, such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, turned to graphite, which gradually improved in quality and availability throughout Europe since the 17th century. Silverpoint was for practical purposes rendered obsolete by the 18th century. There has however been a contemporary art revival among European and American artists and academies because the medium imposes considerable discipline in draughtsmanship since drawings cannot be erased or altered.

== Revival ==

Joseph Meder, Alphonse Legros, the Pre-Raphaelites and Joseph Stella helped revitalize the technique. Art historian Meder created interest in the traditional technique in Austria and Germany, while artist and teacher Legros did likewise in England. In the early 20th century, Stella was one of the few American artists working in this method on the East Coast of the United States. Stella explored the technique on zinc white gouache prepared grounds, often with crayon and other media. Stella&#x27;s silverpoint oeuvre includes the 1921 portrait of Marcel Duchamp (MoMA, Katherine S. Dreier Bequest). On the West Coast Xavier Martínez, the Mexican-American artist who had studied in Paris at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in the late 1890s during the resurgence of interest in silverpoint, taught this technique at the California College of the Arts from 1909 to the late 1930s. The last known exhibition of Martinez&#x27;s silverpoints was in 1921 at the Print Room of San Francisco where critics praised his &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;strongly futuristic&quot; action figures on an unconventional dark mottled ground as &quot;archaic in execution ... terse, alert ... with a bit too much flesh.&quot;

An exhibit, &quot;The Fine Line: Drawing with Silver in America&quot; was curated for the Norton Museum of Art, in 1985 by Bruce Weber. In 2015, the National Gallery of Art and the British Museum exhibited &quot;Drawing in Silver and Gold: Leonardo to Jasper Johns&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
A traditional silverpoint stylus is made with a small fine rod of silver, such as jewelry wire, which is inserted into a wooden rod. Another design is a silver-tipped metal stylus with points on both ends. An example of this type is shown in Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;St. Luke Drawing the Virgin,&quot; ca. 1435–40 (Boston Museum of Fine Arts). For a contemporary stylus, jeweler&#x27;s wire may be inserted into a pin vise or mechanical pencil.

The initial marks of silverpoint appear grey as other metalpoints, but silverpoint lines, when exposed to air, tarnish to a warm brown tone. The oxidation becomes perceptible over a period of several months. The speed of oxidation varies according to the level of pollution in the air. Historically, silverpoint styli ranged widely in composition from pure silver to heavily alloyed with copper (over 20% weight).

In the Middle Ages, metalpoint was used directly on parchment for the underdrawing of illuminated manuscripts or model books. On uncoated parchment (and paper), silverpoint is particularly light in value. However, since the 14th century, silverpoint was used more successfully on prepared supports. A traditional ground may be prepared with a rabbit skin glue solution pigmented with bone ash, chalk and/or lead white. Contemporary grounds include acrylic gesso, gouache and commercially prepared claycoat papers. The slight tooth of the ground preparation takes a little of the silver as it is drawn across the surface.
Silverpoint has encompassed a wide range of styles from Dürer&#x27;s curvilinear precision to Rembrandt&#x27;s gestural sketches. Silverpoint has also proven adaptable to modern styles. Thomas Wilmer Dewing&#x27;s late 19th Century silverpoint portraits are essentially tonal, as are Paula Gerard&#x27;s mid-20th-century abstract compositions. Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Vortex&quot; (Fairweather Hardin Gallery) is an innovative combination of silverpoint, goldpoint and watercolor on casein-coated parchment.

Old Master silverpoints are typically intimate in scale, recalling the technique&#x27;s roots in manuscript illumination. However, modern artists have also utilized this fine line technique for works on an increasingly large scale. John Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Great Autobiographical Silverpoint Drawing&quot; (Art Institute of Chicago 1986.8) which is , one of the largest modern silverpoints.

Silverpoint was also used in conjunction with other metal points by 20th-century artists. Pedro Joseph de Lemos, the Director of the San Francisco Art Institute from 1911 to 1917, popularized his &quot;techniques&quot; in California art schools with his published instructions on the easy fabrication of various types of metal points that would react with inexpensive coated paper. In his &quot;The Last of the Old Woodstock Inn&quot;, 1968 (The Art Institute of Chicago), Ivan Le Lorraine Albright used silver with platinum, gold, copper and brasspoint on commercially prepared video media paper. Contemporary artists continue to push the boundaries of this ancient drawing technique. Contemporary American silverpoint artist Carol Prusa combines graphite and binder on acrylic hemispheres with metal leaf, video projection and fiber optics. Susan Schwalb has combined smoke and fire in silver and copperpoints in the 1980s and currently creates drawings and paintings using numerous metals as well as acrylic paint. Jeannine Cook combines touches of colour with monochromatic drawings, employing such media as Prismacolour, watercolour, Plike paper, silk fabric and silk threads. Experimental metalpoint techniques including goldpoint on silicon carbide paper are demonstrated in &quot;Draw Like da Vinci&quot; by Susan Dorothea White, as in &quot;Gilding the Lily&quot; (2005). Elizabeth Whiteley interfaces with computer-based imagery. She draws with a silver stylus over inkjet prints that have been coated with a translucent prepared ground.

<text>The Socialist Party (), now called Socialist Politics () is a Swedish Trotskyist organization and former political party. It the Swedish section of the Fourth International.

==History==
The party was formed at a congress in 1971, through the merger of the Revolutionary Marxists (RM) and the Bolshevik Group (BG). Initially it was called League of Revolutionary Marxists (, RMF). One section of RM did not agree with the formation of RM and formed the Communist Working Groups (, KAG). KAG would later reconcile with RMF. It dissolved in 1972 and former members joined either RMF or the Left Party – the Communists.

At the fifth party congress, held in 1975, the name was changed to Communist Workers League (&quot;Kommunistiska Arbetarförbundet&quot;). In 1982, the party adopted its current name.

In the early 1990s, the party suffered a small split that went on to form the Swedish section of the Pathfinder tendency. In 1994, a smaller group left the SP to form a Swedish section of what is now the League for the Fifth International, Workers&#x27; Power.

The party publishes the weekly paper &quot;Internationalen&quot;. It is currently not represented in local office.

As of 2019, the party has been reorganized from a political party into an ideological organization, and calls for its members to vote for the Left Party.

During the 2023 Brazilian Congress attack the organization expressed solidarity with President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

<doc id="1155631" wikidata="Q1249132" url="?curid=1155631" title="The Cold Equations">
<text>&quot;The Cold Equations&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Tom Godwin (1915–1980), first published in &quot;Astounding Magazine&quot; in August 1954. In 1970, the Science Fiction Writers of America selected it as one of the best science-fiction short stories published before 1965, and it was therefore included in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964&quot;. It has been widely anthologized and dramatized.

==Plot summary==
In the year 2178, a small Emergency Dispatch Ship (EDS) is launched from the interstellar cruiser &quot;Stardust&quot; to deliver desperately needed medicine to the frontier planet Woden. The EDS pilot, Barton, soon discovers a stowaway: 18-year-old Marilyn Lee Cross.

By law, all EDS stowaways are to be jettisoned because an EDS carries only enough fuel to reach its destination. Marilyn wanted merely to visit her brother Gerry on the remote planet and was unaware of the law. When she saw the &quot;UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL KEEP OUT!&quot; sign while she was sneaking onboard, she thought that at most she would have to pay a fine if caught.

Barton sadly explains to her that her additional weight would make it impossible to land safely; they would crash on the planet, killing both them and the colonists needing the medicine. (Barton also cannot sacrifice his own life to save Marilyn, since she would not know how to pilot the ship.) After recovering from her shock and horror, and contacting Gerry, Marilyn willingly climbs into the airlock and is ejected into space.

==Development==
The story was shaped by &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; editor John W. Campbell, who sent &quot;Cold Equations&quot; back to Godwin three times before he got the version he wanted because &quot;Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl!&quot;
Campbell&#x27;s biographer Alec Nevala-Lee noted in 2016 that the story was published at a time when Campbell had embraced contrarianism on the basis that (in Campbell’s words) there was &quot;no viewpoint that has zero validity—though some have very small validity, or very limited application.&quot;
Nevala-Lee also revealed that Campbell described the story as a &quot;gimmick on the proposition ‘&quot;human sacrifice is absolutely unacceptable&quot;’. So we deliberately, knowingly and painfully sacrifice a young, pretty girl... and make the reader accept that it is valid!&quot;

==Reception==
Richard Harter wrote a detailed analysis of the story in 1977, with special attention to the possible negligence of those who designed the situation in which dilemmas like this could occur, and how this paralleled similar concerns involving industrial safety legislation.

Writer Don Sakers&#x27; short story &quot;The Cold Solution&quot; deconstructs the premise. In 1992 it was awarded &quot;the readers&#x27; favorite&quot; &quot;Analog&quot; short story of 1991.

In 1996, critic and engineer Gary Westfahl wrote that because the story&#x27;s premise is based on systems that were built without adequate margin for error, the story is &quot;good physics&quot;, but &quot;lousy engineering&quot;, and that it frustrated him so much he decided it had been &quot;not worth [his] time&quot;.

In 2014, writer Cory Doctorow made a similar argument: he sees the situation presented in the story as an example of a &quot;moral hazard&quot;. Doctorow notes that the constraints under which the characters operate are decided by the writers, and not &quot;the inescapable laws of physics&quot;. He argues that the decision of the writer—to give the vessel no margin of safety and a critical supply of fuel and to focus readers&#x27; attention onto the necessity of tough decisions at a time of crisis, rather than mulling over the responsibility for proper planning from the onset—is intellectually dishonest and that &quot;stories about how we can’t afford to hew to our values in time of crisis are a handy addition to every authoritarian’s playbook&quot;.

In a 2019 essay, Doctorow condemned Campbell for turning the story &quot;into a parable about the foolishness of women and the role of men in guiding them to accept the cold, hard facts of life&quot;.

==Precursors==
There was a similar concept in a number of earlier stories:

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; points to &quot;A Plunge into Space&quot; (Robert Cromie, 1890) as having a subplot very similar to &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;. &quot;A Weighty Decision&quot; (Al Feldstein in &quot;Weird Science&quot;, 1952) and the story &quot;Precedent&quot; (E. C. Tubb in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, 1952) also have been cited as potential inspirations. In all three, as in &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;, a stowaway must be ejected from a spaceship because the fuel aboard is only sufficient for the planned mission mass.

David Drake stated &quot;The plot is lifted directly from &#x27;A Weighty Decision,&#x27; a story in the May–June, 1952, issue of the EC comic &quot;Weird Science&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe that coincidence could have created plots so similar in detail&quot; and ends with &quot;The plot is such an obvious steal from the comic that I think Godwin would have concealed it better if he hadn&#x27;t intended to use a completely different ending. I can also imagine that Godwin wouldn&#x27;t have expressed his qualms at changing the ending to Campbell, who wouldn&#x27;t have winked at direct plagiarism. (Not that EC had any legitimate gripe: Bill Gaines laughed in later years about the way he and his staff at EC stole plots from SF stories and ran them without credit.)&quot;

==Dramatic adaptations==
===Radio plays===
* The story was also adapted into an episode of the radio program &quot;X Minus One&quot; in 1955. In a 1958 episode of &quot;Exploring Tomorrow&quot;, the stowaway is a woman trying to visit her husband to make amends for an affair.
* Another adaptation featured as a part of &quot;Faster Than Light&quot; on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot; in September 2002 by Joe Mahoney. The program was hosted by science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer.

===Film and television===
* An adaptation of the story aired on the 1962 British anthology series &quot;Out of This World&quot; and starred Peter Wyngarde and Jane Asher. The episode was lost soon after broadcast, but an audio-only recording has survived and is available on DVD.
* Another television adaptation aired as part of the 1985–1989 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.
*Episode 8 of the anime &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; is named for and takes elements from the story.
* The story formed the basis for a 1996 made-for-TV movie starring Billy Campbell and Poppy Montgomery, which aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.
* It is the basis of the award-winning 2014 short film, &quot;The Stowaway&quot;, which was released on YouTube.
* A similar premise is used for the 2021 film &quot;Stowaway&quot;.

==Awards==
Tied for 9th place in &quot;Astounding/Analog&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1971 All-Time Poll short fiction category.

Placed 8th in the 1999 Locus Awards for best novelette.

<doc id="1155635" wikidata="Q541298" url="?curid=1155635" title="Anglo-Scottish Cup">
<text>The Anglo-Scottish Cup was a tournament arranged for teams in the English and Scottish football leagues during the summer for several years during the 1970s. It was created in 1975 as a new incarnation of the Texaco Cup, with a similar format to its predecessor, but involving clubs from England and Scotland only.

The competition made every attempt to maintain the status of a top-level tournament. Newcastle United were expelled from the 1976–77 competition for playing a weakened team in the first leg of their quarter-final against Ayr United. Over the years, however, English entrants were increasingly drawn from the lower divisions, and in 1981 the Scottish clubs withdrew as the public showed little interest in the competition. As the final winners, Chesterfield still hold the trophy and it is displayed in their Board Room. The competition continued, with English clubs only, as the Football League Group Cup.

In the 1987–88 season, an attempt was made to revive the competition as the &quot;Anglo-Scottish Challenge&quot;, pitting the holders of the FA Cup and Scottish Cup against each other, but after a poor attendance for the first leg between Coventry City and St Mirren the competition was shelved, with the second leg never played.

Nottingham Forest’s victory in the 1976-77 final over Orient was their first trophy under the management of Brian Clough, who later stated that he took the tournament seriously (when many other clubs did not) and considered it the springboard for Forest&#x27;s future success, as they would go on to win a First Division title and two European Cups over the following three seasons. Clough had taken a similar stance on the competition&#x27;s predecessor, the Texaco Cup, and won it with Derby County in 1972, the same year he guided them to their first league title.

==Format==
The format of the competition remained constant throughout the six years of its existence, and indeed the format was the same as the last edition of its forerunner, the Texaco Cup.

Sixteen English clubs competed in four groups of four, with the winners of each group qualifying for the quarter-finals. Clubs played each of the other teams in their group once, with two points awarded for a win, one for a draw, and a bonus point for each side that scored three or more goals in a single match.

Eight Scottish League clubs played a two-legged knock-out round, with the aggregate winners of each tie qualifying to the overall quarter-finals. For the overall quarter-finals, each club was paired against a club from the other country and the tournament then progressed in a knock-out format, with each tie (including the final) being played over two legs.

In the early years, around half of the English clubs were drawn from that season&#x27;s First Division (excepting clubs playing in Europe), although by the latter years of the tournament only two or three top-level English sides were playing, with participation stretching down to Third and Fourth Division sides.

==List of finals==
NB Finals played over two legs, aggregate score given.

St Mirren became the only Scottish winner of the event following their success in 1979–80, defeating Bristol City 2–0 at Ashton Gate Stadium in the first leg, before a 3–1 home 2nd leg victory on 16 April 1980.

Chesterfield&#x27;s victory in the 1980–81 event was secured with an extra-time goal from Alan Crawford.

<doc id="1155645" wikidata="Q252541" url="?curid=1155645" title="Fire Island National Seashore">
<text>Fire Island National Seashore (FINS) is a United States National Seashore that protects a section of Fire Island, an approximately long and wide barrier island separated from Long Island by the Great South Bay. The island is part of New York State&#x27;s Suffolk County and the Outer Barrier.

There are 17 private communities within the boundaries of Fire Island National Seashore including Saltaire, Fire Island Pines, and Ocean Beach. Only two bridges lead to Fire Island and the national seashore and there are no public roads within the seashore itself. The Robert Moses Causeway leads to Robert Moses State Park on the western end of Fire Island while the William Floyd Parkway leads to the eastern end of the island. The seashore can also be accessed by private boat or by ferry from the communities of Patchogue, Sayville, and Bay Shore on Long Island.

Fire Island National Seashore was established as a unit of the National Park Service on September 11, 1964.

A separate unit of Fire Island National Seashore located on Long Island protects the home and estate of William Floyd, an American Revolutionary War general and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The William Floyd House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in Mastic Beach, New York.

==Attractions==

* The Fire Island Light is located near the western end of the seashore near Robert Moses State Park.
* Lighthouse Beach is a beach at the extreme west end of the seashore, just east of Robert Moses State Park. Since 2013, a nudity ban has been enforced at this former clothing optional beach.
* Sailor&#x27;s Haven is home to a popular boardwalk trail through an area known as the Sunken Forest as well as a visitor center, general store, and a public marina.
* Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness, located on the eastern end of Fire Island, is the only federally designated U.S. Wilderness Area in New York State.

== Wilderness area ==

The Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness, also known as Fire Island Wilderness, is a wilderness area on Fire Island. It is approximately long and located on the eastern side of Fire Island. The United States Congress designated the Otis Pike High Dune Wilderness Area in 1980. The wilderness area is named for former New York Congressman Otis G. Pike, who co-sponsored the bill which created the Fire Island National Seashore and worked hard to secure public support and the legislation&#x27;s passage through Congress to establish the new national park. It is the only federally designated wilderness area in New York State and one of the smallest wilderness areas managed by the National Park Service.

The wilderness includes pine forests, grassy wetlands, and dunes that serve as habitat for white-tailed deer, herons and migratory waterfowl. The wilderness area does not technically include the beaches that face the Atlantic Ocean. Hiking, back-country camping, and fishing access are available within the wilderness.

Access to the Otis G. Pike Wilderness can be obtained either from Watch Hill (which is accessible seasonally by ferry or private boat) or Smith Point County Park, accessible year round by car or bus. The Wilderness Visitor Center is located on the eastern edge of the wilderness, adjacent to Smith Point County Park. Privately owned Bellport Beach is located near the central area of the wilderness.

Old Inlet, just west of Smith Point County Park in the wilderness, has been the site of breaches of Fire Island causing the Atlantic Ocean to join with the Great South Bay.

The most recent breach occurred during the high tides associated with Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The breach was wide on the Atlantic side a week after the storm and wide on April 5, 2013.

National Park Service officials have been debating whether to take action to close the breach. Contingency plans put in place to manage breaches within the wilderness area called for initial monitoring of the breach; as of 2014, the breach has stabilized and monitoring continues. Some residents have called for closure of the breach, due to perceived increases in flooding after the breach&#x27;s opening. However, the breach has been responsible for increased water quality in Great South Bay, which had been becoming increasingly polluted by suburban runoff prior to the breach&#x27;s formation, along with repopulation of fish and clams that had been absent from the bay for decades due to pollution.

Officials moved to close two breaches which formed on either side of Moriches Inlet following Hurricane Sandy — one in Cupsogue Beach County Park and the other in Smith Point County Park. A draft plan for action was scheduled to be released in summer 2016. The National Park Service ultimately decided not to take any action and instead let the landscape evolve naturally. By summer 2022, the breach was filling with sand, having shrunk tenfold to less than 100 feet wide.

<text>Brambles Limited is an Australian company that specialises in the pooling of unit-load equipment, pallets, crates and containers. It is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

==History==
Brambles traces its history to 1875, when Walter Bramble established a butchery business in Newcastle, the operations of which he gradually expanded into transport and logistics. Brambles was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1954, as W E Bramble &amp; Sons Limited and entered the pallet pooling business in 1958 through the purchase of the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool (CHEP), from the Australian Government. This same year the company changed its name to Brambles Industries Limited and moved its head office from Newcastle to Sydney.

In 1970, Brambles entered the waste disposal market with the purchase of the Australian subsidiary of Purle Brothers Holdings. In 1972, Brambles entered the armoured car market in partnership with Brink&#x27;s. In 1972, Brambles purchased the Port Jackson &amp; Manly Steamship Company. Brambles main interest in the business, was a 50% shareholding in Tidewater Port Jackson Marine, which operated six platform supply vessels. Following a threat by Brambles to withdraw the loss-making Manly ferry service, the Public Transport Commission took over the service in December 1974. In 1975, Brambles formed an 80:20 joint venture with UK company Guest Keen &amp; Nettlefold (GKN) to bring CHEP to the United Kingdom.

In July 1984, Grace Removals was purchased. In 1988, Brambles became the largest private rail wagon operator in Europe acquiring Groupe CAIB of Brussels and Procor&#x27;s United Kingdom business. In December 1989 equipment hire business Wreckair was purchased.

In 1990 Brambles acquired Econofrieght a Thornaby based heavy haulage company which was one of the biggest heavy haulage company later the business was sold in two different parts light heavy transport to GE Curtis heavy haulage a Cleveland based subsidiary owned by Sarens in 1997 and rest of the business to ALE in 1999 a Hixon based heavy haulage company which was later acquired by Mammoet in 2020. In 1996, Brambles Transport Services was sold to Toll Holdings.

In June 2000, Brambles sold its Eurotainer container business to Ermewa and Brinks Brambles armoured car unit to Chubb Security.

In August 2001, the support services activities of GKN (which included interest in CHEP and Cleanaway) were merged into a separate company, Brambles Industries plc (listed on the London Stock Exchange) which then entered became a dual-listed company with Brambles Industries Limited. In December 2001, the Wreckair equipment hire business was sold to Coates Hire.

In March 2002, the United Transport and Brambles Project Services businesses were sold to Patrick Corporation. In October 2002, the railway leasing business was sold to VTG-Lehnkering. In November 2002 the Brambles Shipping business, including the ships &quot;Tasmanian Achiever&quot; and &quot;Victorian Reliance&quot;, was sold to Toll Holdings.

In 2006, the company&#x27;s Australian waste management business, Cleanaway Australia and its Brambles Industrial Services business were sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Cleanaway UK was sold to Veolia. Following these divestments, Brambles unified its Australian and British-listed entities into a single entity, Brambles Limited, that was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in November 2006. Brambles maintained a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange until March 2010.

In 2008, Brambles acquired LeanLogistics.

In April 2011 it acquired IFCO. In December 2012 it acquired Pallecon. In December 2013, the Recall storage business was spun-off. In February 2016 it acquired BXB Digital.

<doc id="1155650" wikidata="Q4328354" url="?curid=1155650" title="Maria Stella">
<text>Maria Stella Wynn, Lady Newborough (later Baroness Ungern-Sternberg; ; 16 April 1773 – 23 December 1843) was an Italian-born memoirist, the self-styled legitimate daughter of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. She was the second wife of the Welsh peer Thomas Wynn, 1st Baron Newborough, after whose death she married the Estonian Baron Heinrich George Eduard von Ungern-Sternberg.

According to her, King Louis Philippe I was not the son of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, but a supposititious child, his father being one Lorenzo Chiappini, a constable at the town of Modigliana in Emilia Romagna. The story is that the Duke and Duchess of Orléans, travelling under the incognito of Comte and Comtesse de Joinville, were at this town on 16 April 1773, when the duchess gave birth to a daughter; and that the duke, desiring a son in order to prevent the rich Penthièvre inheritance from reverting to his wife&#x27;s relations in the event of her death, bribed the Chiappinis to substitute their newborn male child for his own.

==Life==
Maria Stella Petronilla Chiappini was born to an ordinary Italian family in 1773, in a small town (later city) called Modigliana, near Forlì. According to Maria&#x27;s autobiography, she was treated poorly by her mother as a child, while her brothers and sisters gained all the attention. Years later after the death of her father, who had sent her a letter confessing that he was indeed not her biological father, she understood the treatment that she had been given by her mother and Countess Camilla Borghi&#x27;s kindness towards her.

Maria Stella, the supposed daughter of Chiappini, went on the stage at Florence, where her putative parents had settled. There, on 10 October 1786 at the age of thirteen, she became the wife of Thomas Wynn, 1st Baron Newborough. The couple had two sons:
* Thomas John Wynn, 2nd Baron Newborough (3 April 1802 – 15 November 1832)
* Spencer Bulkeley Wynn, 3rd Baron Newborough (23 May 1803 – 1 November 1888)

After Lord Newborough&#x27;s death, she married on 11 September 1810 the Estonian Baron Eduard Ungern-Sternberg (9 October 1782 – 17 May 1861) at St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Coxwold. They had one child:
* Baron Edward von Ungern-Sternberg (17 August 1811 – 6 January 1842)

On the death of her putative father in 1821 she received a letter, written by him shortly before his death, in which he confessed that she was not his daughter, adding &quot;Heaven has repaired my fault, since you are in a better position than your real father, though he was of almost similar rank&quot; (i.e. a French nobleman). Maria Stella henceforward devoted her time and fortune to establishing her identity.

Her first success was the judgment of the episcopal court at Faenza, which in 1824 declared that the Comte Louis de Joinville exchanged his daughter for the son of Lorenzo Chiappini, and that the Demoiselle de Joinville had been baptized as Maria Stella, with the false statement that she was the daughter of L Chiappini and his wife. The discovery that Joinville was a countship of the Orléans family, and a real or fancied resemblance of Louis Philippe to Chiappini, convinced her that the duke of Orleans was the person for whose sake she had been cheated of her birthright, a conviction strengthened by the striking resemblance which many people discovered in her to the princesses of the Orléans family.

In 1830 she published her proofs under the title &quot;Maria Stella ou un échange d&#x27;une demoiselle du plus haut rang contre un garçon de plus vile condition&quot; (reprinted 1839 and 1849). This coincided with the advent of Louis Philippe to the throne, and her claim became a weapon for those who wished to throw discredit and ridicule on the bourgeois monarch. He for his part treated the whole thing with amused contempt, and Baroness Newborough-Sternburg de Joinville, or Marie Étoile d&#x27;Orléans, as she called herself, was suffered to live in Paris until on 23 December 1843 she died in poverty and obscurity.

==Analysis==
In spite of much discussion and investigation, the case of Maria Stella remains one of the unsolved problems of history but which could be solved today by DNA as there are direct descendants of all those involved. Sir Ralph Payne Gallwey&#x27;s &quot;Mystery of Maria Stella, Lady Newborough&quot; (London, 1907), is founded on her own accounts and argues in favour of her point of view.

An alternative view is Maurice Vitrac&#x27;s &quot;Philippe-Egalité et M. Chiappini&quot; (Paris, 1907), which is based on unpublished material in the Archives nationales. Vitrac seeks to overthrow Maria Stella&#x27;s case by an . The duke and duchess of Chartres could not have been at Modigliana in April 1773, for the simple reason that they can be proved at that time to have been in Paris. On 8 April the duke, according to the official &quot;Gazette de France&quot;, took part in the Maundy Thursday ceremonies at Versailles; from 7 April to 14 April he was in constant attendance at the lodge of Freemasons of which he had just been elected grand master. Moreover, it was impossible for the first prince of the blood royal to leave France without royal permission, and his absence would certainly have been remarked. Lastly, the duchess&#x27;s &quot;accouchement&quot;, a semi-public function in the case of royal princesses, did not take place till 6 October. Vitrac identifies the real father of Maria Stella with Count Carlo Battaglini of Rimini, who died in 1796 without issue; the case being not one of substitution, but of ordinary farming out to avoid a scandal.

==Legacy==
In 2017 the city council of Modigliana set up a programme of events to commemorate the figure of Maria Stella, including conferences, lectures, studies and a theatre historical drama written and directed by L.A. Mazzoni and played by actors of Filodrammatica Berton. There is now a plaque commemorating the event on the Palazzo Pretorio where the exchange is alleged to have taken place. It consists of a relief with figures of the Count and Countess of Joinville and Lorenzo and Vincentia Chiappini handing babies to each other.

<text>The Museum of Tolerance (MOT), also known as Beit HaShoah (&quot;House of the Holocaust&quot;), is a multimedia museum in Los Angeles, California, United States, designed to examine racism and prejudice around the world with a strong focus on the history of the Holocaust. The museum was established in 1993, as the educational arm of human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center. The museum also deals with atrocities in Cambodia and Latin America, along with issues like bullying and hate crimes. The museum has an associated museum and professional development multi-media training facility in New York City.

The museum is closed on Saturdays, the Jewish day of rest and on all major Jewish holidays and United States public holidays.

== Overview ==
The original museum in Los Angeles, California, opened in 1993. It was built at a cost of $50 million by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after its founder Simon Wiesenthal, a Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter. The museum receives 350,000 visitors annually, about a third of which are school-age children. The museum&#x27;s most talked-about exhibit is &quot;The Holocaust Section&quot;, where visitors are divided into groups to take their own place in some of the events of World War II. The museum also features testimonies of Holocaust survivors, often from live volunteers who tell their stories and answer questions. People also get cards with pictures of Jewish children on them and at the end of the museum trip, it is revealed whether the child on the card survived or was murdered in the Holocaust.

In addition, the museum features a &quot;Tolerancenter&quot; that discusses issues of prejudice in everyday life, a Multimedia Learning Center, Finding Our Families – Finding Ourselves, a collection of archives and documents, various temporary exhibits such as Los Angeles visual artist Bill Cormalis Jr&#x27;s A&#x27; Game In The B Leagues&quot;, which documents through paintings, the Civil Rights Movement during the segregation of colored people in Major League Baseball, and an Arts and Lectures Program.

A classroom visit to the museum is featured in the 2007 movie &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, based on the real-life story of high school teacher Erin Gruwell and her students. The museum was parodied in an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; called &quot;The Death Camp of Tolerance&quot;.

Over 350,000 people visit the museum annually, including 110,000 children.

== Education ==
The museum runs a program called &quot;The Museums Tools for Tolerance (r) for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Professional&quot;. Through its inception in 1996, it has trained over 75,000 law enforcement officers. The success of the program led to the creation of the New York Tolerance Center.

== Criticism ==
In the past, some journalists and academics have criticized the way the Museum deals with its exhibits; Oren Baruch Stier, who specializes in Holocaust research and Jewish studies, criticized the museum in 1996 for not contextualizing the Holocaust. He argued against the separation of the museum&#x27;s &quot;tolerance&quot; section and its area dedicated to the Holocaust. In 2003, Christopher Reynolds wrote, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, that the museum lacked any exhibit about the Armenian genocide. Political theorist Wendy Brown critiqued the museum in a chapter of her 2009 book &quot;Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire&quot;; in the book, Brown analyzed &quot;tolerance as a museum object&quot;, and made connections between the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and genocide directed at non-Jewish groups. She thought that the experience of the museum could make its visitors more vigilant against social prejudice and stereotyping.

<text>Air Wales () was a Welsh airline based at Cardiff International Airport in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan. It operated scheduled regional services within the United Kingdom, as well as to Ireland, Belgium and France. On 23 April 2006, Air Wales ceased all operations, citing &quot;spiralling costs&quot; and &quot;aggressive competition&quot; from larger low-cost airlines.

==History==
Air Wales was established in January 1997 with the assistance of property financier Roy Thomas and started operations in January 2000. Initially based at Pembrey Airport in west Wales and operating two Dornier 228 aircraft, Air Wales expanded to employ over 120 personnel, including 45 flight deck staff, 20 engineers and 20 cabin crew.

Operations transferred to Red Dragon House at the grounds of Swansea Airport, Fairwood Common, in October 2001. Passenger numbers failed to reach the company&#x27;s break-even levels and, after three years, Air Wales gave up all its Swansea routes. The airline decided to concentrate on routes out of Cardiff, moving operations to a new headquarters at Cardiff International Airport in October 2004.

In December 2005, bmibaby and Air Wales had a fallout leaving bmibaby to cancel a partnership between the two airlines. The partnership covered the routes Belfast and Glasgow which were operated by Air Wales.

During February 2006, Air Wales gave up all routes from Plymouth Airport to focus on more popular routes and international routes.

On 23 April 2006, the airline ceased all scheduled services with a loss of 80 jobs to focus on charter and cargo operations, however these operations never materialized and the aircraft were all sold to other airlines.

==Destinations==
Air Wales served 20 destinations across Europe. 

===Partnership with bmibaby===
Air Wales had a partnership with bmibaby to operate on the following routes:

*Paris, France
*Cork, Ireland
*Belfast, Northern Ireland [suspended in March 2006]
*Jersey
*Glasgow, Scotland [suspended in March 2006]

==Fleet==

Air Wales originally operated Dornier 228 aircraft. These were replaced by a fleet of ATR-42-300 aircraft:

In March 2006, Air Wales fleet average age was 13.4 years.

<doc id="1155660" wikidata="Q743598" url="?curid=1155660" title="Stymie Beard">
<text>Matthew Beard Jr. (January 1, 1925 – January 8, 1981) was an American actor. As a child actor, he was most famous for playing Stymie in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short comedy films of 1930–1935. The role was so well known that he adopted the name Stymie Beard, and was so credited in some later roles, such as his 1978 appearance in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;.

==Early life==
Beard was born near Los Angeles, California, to Matthew Beard Sr. and Johnnie Mae Beard (née Clay). His father was the founding pastor of Beloved Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot; years==
Beard previously played baby parts in many films, then signed a five-year contract in 1930 to appear in &quot;Our Gang&quot;. In contrast to Farina, the character whom he replaced, Stymie was a slick-tongued con-artist who was self-assured, nonchalant and ready with a sly comment and clever ideas to solve the problems that he faced. He could offer sound common sense that helped resolve his playmates&#x27; dilemmas.

The character&#x27;s trademark was a bald head crowned by an oversize derby hat, a gift to Beard from comedian Stan Laurel, who also worked under &quot;Our Gang&quot; creator Hal Roach. Stymie is the only member of &quot;Our Gang&quot; who both replaced one of the original gang members (Allen &quot;Farina&quot; Hoskins) and was in turn replaced by one who stayed until the series disbanded: Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas.

The character was originally to be named &quot;Hercules&quot;; however, &quot;Our Gang&quot; director Robert McGowan, frustrated (&quot;stymied&quot;) by little Matthew&#x27;s curious wanderings around the studio, gave him the name &quot;Stymie.&quot; McGowan later recalled that Stymie was his favorite of all the &quot;Our Gang&quot; kids. The then-five-year-old Beard came to the series a year after the transition from the silent/early sound era, and had the distinction of being with the Gang from the sound movies of the early 1930s through the transitional period of the mid-1930s.

In 1934, Roach Studios lent Beard and other &quot;Our Gang&quot; kids to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Eddie Cantor&#x27;s &quot;Kid Millions&quot;, in which they appeared in the Technicolor &quot;ice cream fantasy&quot; finale sequence.

==Family==
Beard&#x27;s paycheck helped support his family in East Los Angeles, including 13 brothers and sisters. After Beard renamed his younger brother Bobbie &quot;Cotton&quot; (which was used as the name of one of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; characters), his parents allowed him to name all of the rest of his siblings as they were born. He named one Dickie after Dickie Moore, another member of &quot;Our Gang&quot; and Beard&#x27;s best friend. Four other members of the Beard family appear in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies:
* His younger sister Betty Jane Beard preceded Stymie in the gang, playing Farina&#x27;s little brother Hector in &quot;Moan &amp; Groan, Inc.&quot; and &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (although she was a girl).
* His younger sister Carlena Beard appears as Stymie&#x27;s younger sister in &quot;Shiver My Timbers&quot;, &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake!&quot;.
* His younger brother Bobbie Beard appears in six &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts from 1932 to 1934 as Stymie&#x27;s younger brother Cotton.
* His mother Johnnie Mae Beard has cameos as Stymie&#x27;s mother in &quot;Big Ears&quot; and &quot;Free Wheeling&quot;.

Beard&#x27;s younger brother Renee Beard appears in two of Hal Roach&#x27;s featurettes of the 1940s, &quot;Curley&quot; and &quot;Who Killed Doc Robbin&quot;, both produced as revivals of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; idea.

==Later years==
After Beard left the series in 1935 at age 10, he acted in minor roles in feature films such as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935) and &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938). At age 15, he appears as Mose the bellboy in the 1940 film &quot;The Return of Frank James&quot;. Beard also appeared in supporting roles in several independent &quot;race films&quot; aimed at African-American audiences, including &quot;Two Gun Man from Harlem&quot; (1938) with Herb Jeffries and &quot;Broken Strings&quot; (1940) with Clarence Muse. Parts dried up as Beard became an older teenager; by the time he was an adult, Beard had retired from acting.

Falling into drug use and street life, Beard was arrested at age eighteen for stealing to fuel a budding marijuana habit. Upon his release, he became addicted to heroin and spent most of his early adult life in and out of jail on drug and theft charges.

In the 1960s, Beard checked himself into Synanon, a drug rehabilitation facility and cult in Los Angeles and successfully ended his heroin use. After leaving Synanon, he made a small comeback, appearing in small roles in feature films and guest-starring in episodes of television shows such as &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot; and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. He appears in episodes of &quot;Maude&quot; as a resident of an apartment complex where the title character&#x27;s husband temporarily lived, and on &quot;Good Times&quot;, where he had a recurring role (1974–1977) as Monty.

In 1978, he appeared in the film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; as a member of the backstage crew at the Apollo Theater, wearing his trademark derby hat.

He also lectured around the United States on drug-abuse awareness.

==Death==
Beard suffered a stroke on January 3, 1981, two days after his 56th birthday, sustained head injuries from falling down a flight of stairs, and died of pneumonia on January 8, 1981. He was living in Los Angeles at the time.

He is interred in the Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles, buried with the famous derby that he wore for all of his life.

==Filmography==
==Legacy==
In the book series &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;, one of the kids is named George Beard. The author Dav Pilkey loved &quot;Our Gang&quot;, so he named the character&#x27;s last name after Beard.

<doc id="1155662" wikidata="Q463683" url="?curid=1155662" title="Karel Roden">
<text>Karel Roden (born 18 May 1962) is a Czech actor, popularly known for his roles in &quot;Hellboy&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, and his voice work in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;.

==Life and career==
Roden followed his father and grandfather into acting. Roden first graduated from the Comprehensive Art Secondary School for Ceramics before being admitted to the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague.

Roden&#x27;s feature film career began almost simultaneous with his theatre work in 1984 as Honza, a medical student in the 2nd part of a trilogy entitled &quot;How the poets are losing their illusions&quot; (Jak básníci přicházejí o iluze), a lighthearted, comic look at life through the lives of young university students. Roden&#x27;s Honza also appeared in the final installation of the trilogy, &quot;How poets are enjoying their lives&quot; (Jak básníkům chutná život). 

Other comic turns include Roden&#x27;s Captain Tuma in &quot;Who&#x27;s That Soldier?&quot;, a humoristic look at life as a soldier in the socialist Czech army, the character Dragan in the action-thriller &quot;Dead Fish&quot; with Gary Oldman and Terence Stamp. In the comedy crime-thriller &quot;Shut Up and Shoot Me&quot;, Roden plays the hen-pecked husband hired to assassinate a grieving widow.

During the 1990s, he spent some time in London, which improved his English and gave him necessary exposure and access to the international scene. Hence, since being outside of Czechoslovakia he has become known mostly for his character actor roles which began in 2001 when Roden secured his first major role in the American psychological thriller, &quot;15 Minutes&quot;, where he played the criminal Emil Slovak partnered with Oleg Taktarov opposite NYPD cop Flemming played by Robert De Niro. This was followed by a similar role, as the lawyer Carter Kounen, in the service of a vampire clan, in the movie &quot;Blade II&quot; in 2002.

This was followed by what became a series of typecast roles, including the action movie &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot;, where he plays the Nazi megalomaniac Strucker. This was no doubt due to his heavy accent and distinct features, which bring him close to the stereotyped Hollywood villain, although his voice was dubbed over by another actor in &quot;Blade II&quot;. This greatly understates, however, the plethora of characters he has portrayed throughout his career, particularly in Czechoslovakia.

His movie roles to date include &quot;15 Minutes&quot; (2001), &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002), &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; (2003), &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), as Grigori Rasputin in &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004), &quot;Running Scared&quot; (2006), &quot;Largo Winch&quot; (2008), &quot;RocknRolla&quot; (2008), and &quot;Orphan&quot; (2009). He also played the Russian movie critic Emil Dachevsky in the film &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (2007). He played Noble Thurzo in &quot;Bathory&quot; (2008), co-production movie filmed by Slovak director Juraj Jakubisko, &quot;A Lonely Place to Die&quot; (2011) and a role as the Czech mobster Karel Benes in the TV series &quot;McMafia&quot; (2019).

For his main character in &quot;Guard No. 47&quot;, Karel Roden received the Czech Lion Award for Best Actor in Leading Role. 8 years later, he received the same award for the portrayal of Jan Masaryk in &quot;A Prominent Patient&quot;. He also received Alfréd Radok Award in 1998 for performing Bruno in &quot;Le Cocu Magnifique&quot; by Fernand Crommelynck. Other notable role was Don Juan in Grabbe&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan and Faust&quot; (Divadlo v Dlouhé). He also appeared in two plays with his brother Marian. He was also a member of the prestigious Prague National Theatre. At the moment he can be found at Theatre Studio DVA in several performances.

Roden has also voiced Mikhail Faustin and Wade &quot;The Fixer&quot; Johnson in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;.

<doc id="1155663" wikidata="Q6270735" url="?curid=1155663" title="Jon Freeman (game designer)">
<text>Jon Freeman is a game designer and co-founder of software developer Automated Simulations, which was later renamed to Epyx and became a major company during the 8-bit era of home computing. He is married to game programmer Anne Westfall, and they work together as Free Fall Associates. Free Fall is best known for &quot;&quot;, one of the earliest titles from Electronic Arts.

==Career==
===Automated Simulations and Epyx===
Freeman worked as a game designer for video game developer and publisher, Epyx, which he co-founded with Jim Connelley in 1978 as Automated Simulations.

Their first game, &quot;Starfleet Orion&quot;, was a two-player only game developed mainly so Connelley could write off the cost of his Commodore PET computer. Freeman provided design while Connelley handled the programming in BASIC. Freeman was amazed when they actually had a finished product and they had to create a company to publish it. So, both he and Connelley fell into the computer game industry by accident.

It was while with this company, still known as Automated Simulations in 1980, that Freeman met his future wife, Anne Westfall, at a computer fair.

&quot;Starfleet Orion&quot; was quickly followed by &quot;Invasion Orion&quot;. What followed was a slew of very successful titles for various platforms. Freeman designed or co-designed a number of Epyx games, such as &quot;Crush, Crumble and Chomp!&quot; and &quot;Rescue at Rigel&quot;. Freeman tired of what he called &quot;office politics&quot; and yearned to get away from the now much larger company.

===&quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;===
In 1980, Freeman, in collaboration with the editors of &quot;Consumer Guide&quot;, wrote &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster under their &quot;Fireside&quot; imprint. In the book, Freeman, explained the history of wargames to that point, the notable companies, the usual components, and evaluated most of the major wargames in print at the time, as well as the role that computer games would play in this field.

===Free Fall Associates===
In 1981, Freeman and Anne Westfall left Epyx to create Free Fall Associates along with game designer Paul Reiche III.

Free Falls&#x27; first game was 1982&#x27;s &quot;Tax Dodge&quot;, which remained obscure. Free Fall went on to develop two highly acclaimed games published by Electronic Arts: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Archon II: Adept&quot;. Originally written for the Atari 8-bit computers, they were ported to other contemporary home systems.

Free Fall developed a few more titles after &quot;Archon II&quot;, but nothing as well-known. Freeman is credited with some recent development work with Square Enix.

<doc id="1155664" wikidata="Q5001911" url="?curid=1155664" title="Business process automation">
<text>Business process automation (BPA), also known as business automation, refers to the technology-enabled automation of business processes.

==Deployment==
BPA tool sets vary in capability, but there is a trend towards the use of artificial intelligence technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured data sets, interact with human beings, and adapt to new types of problems without human-guided training.

==Business process management implementation==
A business process management system differs from BPA. However, it is possible to implement automation based on a BPM implementation. The methods to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools.

==Robotic process automation==

Robotic process automation (RPA) involves the deployment of attended or unattended software agents in an organization&#x27;s environment. These software agents, or robots, are programmed to perform pre-defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes. The goal is to allow humans to focus on more productive tasks, while the software agents handle the repetitive ones.

BPA providers typically focus on different industry sectors, but the underlying approach is generally similar in that they aim to provide the shortest route to automation by interacting with the user interface rather than modifying the application code or database behind it.

==Use of artificial intelligence==
Artificial intelligence software robots are used to handle unstructured data sets (like images, texts, audios) and are often deployed after implementing robotic process automation. They can, for instance, generate an automatic transcript from a video. The combination of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) enables autonomy for the robots, along with the capability to perform cognitive tasks. At this stage, the robot can learn and improve processes by analyzing and adapting them.

<text>Crassula is a genus of succulent plants containing about 200 accepted species, including the popular jade plant (&quot;Crassula ovata&quot;). They are members of the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) and are native to many parts of the globe, but cultivated varieties originate almost exclusively from species from the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

Crassulas are usually propagated by stem or leaf cuttings. Most cultivated forms will tolerate some small degree of frost, but extremes of cold or heat will cause them to lose foliage and die.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Crassula&quot; was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 with 10 species.

=== Etymology ===
The name crassula comes from the Latin adjective &quot;crassus&quot;, meaning thick, referring to the thickening of the succulent leaves.

<text>In mathematics, if formula_1 is a category, then a formula_1-graded category is a category formula_3 together with a functor
formula_4.

Monoids and groups can be thought of as categories with a single object. A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each morphism is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with composition, in the sense that compositions have the product grade.

==Definition==

There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above. A more concrete definition of a graded abelian category is as follows:

Let formula_3 be an abelian category and formula_6 a monoid. Let formula_7 be a set of functors from formula_3 to itself. If

* formula_9 is the identity functor on formula_3,
* formula_11 for all formula_12 and
* formula_13 is a full and faithful functor for every formula_14

we say that formula_15 is a formula_6-graded category.

<text>Hogbacks are stone carved Anglo-Scandinavian style sculptures from 10th- to 12th-century northern England and south-west Scotland. Singular hogbacks were found in Ireland and Wales. Hogbacks fell out of fashion by the beginning of the 11th century. Their function is generally accepted as grave markers. Similar later grave markers have been found in Scandinavia. In Cornwall similar stones are known as &quot;coped stones&quot;.

==Geography and description==
Hogbacks take the form of recumbent monuments, generally with a curved (&#x27;hogbacked&#x27;) ridge, often also with outwardly curved sides. This shape, and the fact that they are frequently decorated with &#x27;shingles&#x27; on either side of the central ridge, show that they are stylised &#x27;houses&#x27; for the dead. The &#x27;house&#x27; is of a Scandinavian longhouse type associated with the &#x27;mead hall&#x27; feasting at Valhalla in pre-Christian Norse religion. One theory is that hogbacks originated among the Danish settlers who emigrated to northern England in the 870s. However, there is not sufficient research to prove or disprove this. The monuments at Govan and Penrith are associated with local native British Cumbric speaking rulers of the period.

It has been suggested that the monument-type was invented about 920. There are particular concentrations of hogbacks in Yorkshire, Cumbria, and in the Govan Stones collection at the former Govan Old Parish Church in Govan on the River Clyde – the first being their likely area of origin. Individual examples are found over a much wider area, however, from Derbyshire to Central Scotland. 

The presence of hogbacks in Scotland is likely due to the Forth-Clyde route, which connected York to Dublin. Most hogback sites in Scotland are along waterway routes. There are stray examples as far afield as the Northern Isles and Orkney.

Ireland has a single example at Castledermot, County Kildare, which is similar to two hogbacks in Ingleby Arncliffe, North Yorkshire.

Wales has a single example of a hogback, located at Llanddewi Aberarth Church.

The most numerous collections are the ones preserved in St Thomas&#x27;s church at Brompton, North Yorkshire. Discovered in 1867 following the restoration of the church, six were taken to Durham Cathedral Library, leaving four whole ones and fragments of others at Brompton. They are characterized by carvings of bears hugging the slabs with strapwork in their mouths. Elsewhere, five impressive examples found in the early medieval churchyard of Govan Old are in the Govan Stones museum, situated in the (former) parish kirk of Govan, Glasgow. There is a fine example in the visitor centre on Inchcolm island in the Firth of Forth. An excellent and highly decorated example exists in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Heysham, near Morecambe.

==Typology==

There are two main types of hogbacks. One is the Brompton type, which is characterized by massive end beasts. The other type is the warrior&#x27;s tomb, which looks more like a house. It does not have massive end beasts. Within the two main groups of hogback styles are smaller subsets. The scroll type hogback is a subset of the warrior&#x27;s tomb type. It is characterized by scroll motifs on the horizontal band below the tegulation.

==Hogbacks at Govan==
Govan sits on the south bank of the Clyde River, and was the Christian centre of the Clyde Britons and the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has the four largest known hogbacks. There are five hogbacks in the Govan Stones museum at Govan Old Parish Church. The earliest, known as &#x27;Govan 2&#x27;, has been dated to the tenth century. It has two rows of tegulation with concave, contoured lines. It has a band of interlace beneath the rows of shingles. The interlace pattern is not the same on either side. It is not continuous on either side. This is the only hogback at Govan with stopped-plait interlacing. The stopped plait on this hogback is characterized by a series of small, separated elements with pellet fillers. It also has a running ring-knot interlace with frets. On the other side, the sections of four-cord plait are stylistically reduced to a contoured diagonal bar crossed with a bar and four small pellets flanking it.

The later four hogbacks at Govan are dated to later in the 10th century. The longest hogback at Govan does not have the decorative motifs that its earlier brother has. It is covered in rows of shingles, but they are not contoured. It is wider with a shallower roof pitch. The third hogback is massive. It has a full-bodied, 3-dimensional end-beast with legs. This single animal straddles the monument from one end to the other. The fourth hogback is also characterized by a single end-beast. Its head faces outward, an uncommon feature in hogbacks. The animal&#x27;s four bent legs point toward its head. The roof ridges resemble a spine and the rows of tegulation are like scales. The fifth hogback has two end-beasts, one at either end. The beasts&#x27; faces and bodies are shown in profile with jaws gaping open, their legs intersecting along the base. This is the only known hogback with end-beasts in this position.

==Coped stones==
In Cornwall grave markers of the hogback type are known as &quot;coped stones&quot;. There are five known coped stones surviving, varying in their resemblance to hogbacks found elsewhere. One is found in St Buryan, another in Lanivet a third at Phillack, a fourth at St Tudy and in 2012 a fifth was excavated in Padstow. Cornish coped stones tend to be longer than normal hogbacks at over 2 metres in length, but shorter in height, and have an unusual hipped roof style. The Lanivet stone is the only known hogback in Cornwall to have beasts carved on the ends. The stones show both Scandinavian and local Cornish influence in their designs, indicating the inclusion of Cornwall in a &quot;western British Viking-age sculptural tradition&quot;.

<doc id="1155691" wikidata="Q5001958" url="?curid=1155691" title="Business transformation">
<text>In management it has been said that business transformation involves making fundamental changes in how business is conducted in order to help cope with shifts in market environment. However this is a relatively narrow definition that overlooks other reasons and ignores other rationales.

A better understanding is achieved by considering that &quot;transformation [..] is generally a response to two things. First, there are underlying problems or causes of organisational pain that need to be addressed. They have to be properly understood but nevertheless they are a key component. Second, there is a desire by the top management and other senior stakeholders to use the opportunity of addressing these causes in ways that fundamentally alter the paradigm of the organisation.&quot; Others describe Business Transformation as &quot;the process of fundamentally changing the systems, processes, people and technology across a whole business or business unit. As such, a business transformation project is likely to include any number of change management projects, each focused on an individual process, system, technology, team or department.&quot;

==When business transformation is used==
The need for business transformation may be caused by external changes in the market such as an organisation&#x27;s products or services being out of date, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition becoming more intense. This management approach may also incorporate business process reengineering (BPR). However application of BPR does not of itself constitute a business transformation, the outcome should be the deciding factor as to whether any activity is truly transformational or simply improvement. Other methods like Lean or Six Sigma are rooted in incremental improvement rather than paradigm shifts in the way things are done:
* To increase revenue or market share
* To improve customer satisfaction
* To cut costs

==Components==
Business transformation is achieved by one or more of: realigning the way staff work, how the organisation is structured, the core product or service portfolio of the business and how technology is used. Typically organizations go through several stages in transforming themselves:
* Recognising the need to change and gaining consensus amongst stakeholders that change is necessary
* Agreeing what form the change should take, the objectives of the change and a vision that describes a better future
* Understanding what the organisation is changing from and what needs to change in detail 
* Designing the new organisational way of working and its support and management
* Testing and implementing changes, usually in waves (this may take place over a number of years)
* Bedding in the change so that the organisation cannot move back to how it was and achieves the intended benefits

Business transformation can lead to developing new competencies and making better use of existing competencies.

==Transformation examples==
Examples of organisational transformation include:
* General Motors&#x27; transformation and restructuring (around 2009)
* BBC&#x27;s Delivering Quality First programme (since 2011)
* Box&#x27;s pivot from consumer to enterprise (around 2009-2010)
* British Airways&#x27; strategic transformation programme in response to low cost airlines (around 2004-2005)

<text>Aufidius Bassus was a renowned Roman historian and orator who lived in the reign of Augustus and Tiberius. 

Bassus was a man much admired in Rome for his eloquence. He drew up an account of the Roman wars in Germany. Uncertainty in his health perhaps prevented him from holding a public office. He suddenly died of illness leaving his works unfinished.

His work, which probably began with the Roman civil wars or the death of Julius Caesar up to the end of the Sejanus, or perhaps Tiberius, was continued in thirty-one books by Pliny the Elder. Pliny the Elder carried it down at least as far as the end of Nero&#x27;s reign. Bassus&#x27; other historical work was a &quot;Bellum Germanicum&quot;, which was published before his &quot;Histories&quot;.

Seneca the Elder speaks highly of Bassus as a historian; however, the fragments preserved in that writer&#x27;s &quot;Suasoriae&quot; (vi. 23) relating to the death of Cicero are characterized by an affected style.

<text>Air Scotland was a Scottish low-cost airline based in Glasgow, Scotland. It operated scheduled services from Glasgow Airport, and other UK airports, to the Mediterranean and Athens using the air operator&#x27;s certificate of Greece Airways, a Greek registered company and licensed by the Greek Civil Aviation Authority.

The airline formerly known as Air Scotland is no longer operating, as the Greek Civil Aviation Authority suspended their Operating Licence and AOC in December 2006.

==History==
Air Scotland was established in November 2002 by Iraqi-born businessman Dhia Al-Ani and started operations on 29 March 2003, using 2 Boeing 757-200 aircraft operated by Electra Airlines, to Spanish holiday resorts. The company was a ticket provider for Electra Airlines until 25 April 2003, when the Electra aircraft were grounded by BAA plc over debts owed to the airport operator. Air Scotland ceased the agreement with Electra and began operating with Air Holland, who agreed to resume operation of the former Electra routes. With the demise of Air Holland, it then began operating under the air operator&#x27;s certificate of Greece Airways, which was formed out of Electra and owned by Mr Al-Ani, albeit with only one 757 aircraft. All aircraft (before 2006) that have operated for Air Scotland have carried the operator&#x27;s livery of white fuselage with the Flag of Scotland design on the aircraft tailfin.

Under Mr Al-Ani&#x27;s ownership, there were reports of Air Scotland looking to lease two Lockheed L-1011 Tristar to utilise on services from Glasgow to Miami, New York City and Cuba, and to fly between Glasgow and London Stansted Airport to Baghdad, but these failed to materialise.

At the start of October 2005 Mr Al-Ani sold his stake in the airline to H Top Hotels Group of Barcelona, Spain. However, administrative difficulties in transferring ownership of the airline resulted in the operator&#x27;s solitary aircraft being grounded at Palma over unpaid fuel bills. Passengers were left stranded for up to 17 hours and in one instance armed police were called to calm angry passengers delayed in Palma. The knock-on effect to the airline&#x27;s network as a result of the delay was considerable. An aircraft was chartered from Fischer Air Polska to help clear the backlog, but returned to Poland empty after the pilot refused service to Air Scotland as he believed that they had not paid. Air Scotland had in fact transferred money to Fischer Air Polska&#x27;s account that morning.

==Destinations==

==Fleet==
On the day the Airline ceased trading, it operated a single A320-211 based in Glasgow, it had also operated a Boeing 757-200 which wore a combination of Air Scotland &amp; Greece Airways decals.

<doc id="1155729" wikidata="Q3918566" url="?curid=1155729" title="Mohan Lal Kashmiri">
<text>Mohan Lal Zutshi KLS (popularly known as Mohan Lal Kashmiri; 1812 – 1877) was an Indian traveler, diplomat, and author. He is credited as being an important player in the so-called Great Game—possibly the first notable Indian one. He also played a central role in the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1838–1842. His biography of Dost Mohammad Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan in Kabul, is a primary source on the war.

Mohan Lal&#x27;s wife, Hyderi Begum, was a Muslim scholar. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, she was said to have maintained a diary of events in Delhi.

== Early life and family ==
Mohan Lal (also called Ram Nath) was from a Zutshi family of Kashmiri Pandits. His great grandfather, Pandit Mani Ram, had a high rank at the Mughal Court in the reign of Shah Alam II. His father, Rai Brahm Nath, also known as Rae Budh Singh, worked for a time for Mountstuart Elphinstone on a diplomatic mission to Peshawar (1808–1809). Mohan Lal studied at the Delhi College, one of the first Indian students to be educated in the English curriculum there.

His only brother, Kedar Nath Zutshi, was a Deputy Collector in Ambala, Panjab Province, and died in 1855.

== Travels with Burnes ==
In 1831 Lieutenant (later Captain) Sir Alexander Burnes of the East India Company&#x27;s service was deputed by the British Government to gather information in the countries lying between India and the Caspian. He was directed to appear as a private individual with a small retinue maintaining a character of poverty. Mohan Lal was engaged by Burnes primarily to assist him in his Persian correspondence and also because Burnes believed that his youth and creed would free him from all danger of his entering into intrigues with the people among whom he was going to travel. Mohan Lal&#x27;s official title was &quot;munshi&quot;, but Mohan Lal preferred the title &quot;Persian secretary&quot;.

Alexander Burnes and Mohan Lal led an expedition to Central Asia in 1832–1834 for procuring political and military intelligence and became firm friends.

== First Anglo-Afghan War ==

Later, Mohan Lal was the Commercial Agent for the British on the Indus and Political Assistant to Burnes in Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War. He witnessed the killing of Burnes by an angry mob in Kabul at the start of the war, which he described in a book he later wrote describing the &quot;Life of Amir Dost Mohammed Khan&quot;. He survived the massacres of 1841 and continued to keep Calcutta informed of events in the Afghan capital from the house of a merchant where he had taken refuge. His reports contained many strong and cogent criticisms of the behaviour of British Officers, and particularly Sir William Hay Macnaghten and General William Elphinstone.

Mohan Lal had learned Persian in Delhi and travelled in the garb of a Muslim, under the pseudonym of &quot;Aga Hasan Jan&quot; or as &quot;Mirza Quli Kashmiri&quot; in Persia and Afghanistan collecting information vital for his British superiors.

During the First Anglo-Afghan War, he was instrumental in setting up and expanding the British intelligence network in Afghanistan and is also alleged to have had a major hand in arranging the assassination, by poisoning, of Mir Masjidi Khan, a major Afghan resistance leader. He found out and handed over to the British authorities secret letters written by the rulers of Kandahar to Mehrab Khan, the ruler of Kalat, exhorting him not to allow passage to the invading British army. He managed to obtain the services of very important functionaries like Mohammed Tahir, Haji Khan Kakari, Abdul Majeed Khan, Akhundzada Ghulam and Mullah Nasooh in Kandahar and Sardar Abdul Rashid Khan, a nephew of the Emir Sardar Dost Mohammad Khan in Ghazni. He played a major role in securing the release of British prisoners held hostage in Bamiyan. He tried to bring peace between the British and the Afghans during such inflammatory situations.

== Later life ==
After the war, Mohan Lal travelled to Europe: In 1844 he sailed from Bombay via Egypt to Britain. During his time in Europe he met Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and Frederick William IV of Prussia, the latter gifting Mohan Lal an inscribed ivory carving of himself.

During his travels in Europe, Mohan Lal was photographed in 1844 by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill. Today his photo is contained in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. While in Scotland, Mohan Lal was also portraited by the famous Scottish painter William Allan. The painting was exhibited by the Royal Scottish Academy in 1845 under the title &quot;Mirza Mohun Lal, Persian secretary to the British Mission at Cabool, and who had previously accompanied Sir Alexander Burnes on his journey to Bokhara&quot;. The current location of the painting, which was sold on 18 April 1850, is unknown. In 1846 he attended the burial of Dwarkanath Tagore in London.

Mohan Lal retired at the age of 32, disappointed that he had not been properly rewarded for his contributions to the British cause in the First Anglo-Afghan War. His later years were spent in obscurity and financial troubles. His marriage to Hyderi Begum is said to have taken place in 1857. His wife was portraited by Paul Fischer.

Mohan Lal died in Delhi in 1877 in obscurity. According to his biographer Hari Ram Gupta, Mohan Lal is reported to have written an extensive diary until his death, but by 1943 its location was no longer known.

<doc id="1155734" wikidata="Q3058206" url="?curid=1155734" title="Graded vector space">
<text>In mathematics, a graded vector space is a vector space that has the extra structure of a &quot;grading&quot; or &quot;gradation&quot;, which is a decomposition of the vector space into a direct sum of vector subspaces, generally indexed by the integers.

For &quot;pure&quot; vector spaces, the concept has been introduced in homological algebra, and it is widely used for graded algebras, which are graded vector spaces with additional structures.

== Integer gradation ==
Let formula_1 be the set of non-negative integers. An formula_2-graded vector space, often called simply a graded vector space without the prefix formula_1, is a vector space together with a decomposition into a direct sum of the form

: formula_4
where each formula_5 is a vector space. For a given &quot;n&quot; the elements of formula_5 are then called homogeneous elements of degree &quot;n&quot;.

Graded vector spaces are common. For example the set of all polynomials in one or several variables forms a graded vector space, where the homogeneous elements of degree &quot;n&quot; are exactly the linear combinations of monomials of degree &quot;n&quot;.

==General gradation==
The subspaces of a graded vector space need not be indexed by the set of natural numbers, and may be indexed by the elements of any set &quot;I&quot;. An &quot;I&quot;-graded vector space &quot;V&quot; is a vector space together with a decomposition into a direct sum of subspaces indexed by elements &quot;i&quot; of the set &quot;I&quot;:
: formula_7

Therefore, an formula_1-graded vector space, as defined above, is just an &quot;I&quot;-graded vector space where the set &quot;I&quot; is formula_1 (the set of natural numbers).

The case where &quot;I&quot; is the ring formula_10 (the elements 0 and 1) is particularly important in physics. A formula_11-graded vector space is also known as a supervector space.

==Homomorphisms==
For general index sets &quot;I&quot;, a linear map between two &quot;I&quot;-graded vector spaces is called a graded linear map if it preserves the grading of homogeneous elements. A graded linear map is also called a homomorphism (or morphism) of graded vector spaces, or homogeneous linear map:

:formula_12 for all &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;.

For a fixed field and a fixed index set, the graded vector spaces form a category whose morphisms are the graded linear maps.

When &quot;I&quot; is a commutative monoid (such as the natural numbers), then one may more generally define linear maps that are homogeneous of any degree &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot; by the property

:formula_13 for all &quot;j&quot; in &quot;I&quot;,

where &quot;+&quot; denotes the monoid operation. If moreover &quot;I&quot; satisfies the cancellation property so that it can be embedded into an abelian group &quot;A&quot; that it generates (for instance the integers if &quot;I&quot; is the natural numbers), then one may also define linear maps that are homogeneous of degree &quot;i&quot; in &quot;A&quot; by the same property (but now &quot;+&quot; denotes the group operation in &quot;A&quot;). Specifically, for &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot; a linear map will be homogeneous of degree −&quot;i&quot; if

:formula_14 for all &quot;j&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, while
:formula_15 if is not in &quot;I&quot;.

Just as the set of linear maps from a vector space to itself forms an associative algebra (the algebra of endomorphisms of the vector space), the sets of homogeneous linear maps from a space to itself – either restricting degrees to &quot;I&quot; or allowing any degrees in the group &quot;A&quot; – form associative graded algebras over those index sets.

==Operations on graded vector spaces==
Some operations on vector spaces can be defined for graded vector spaces as well.

Given two &quot;I&quot;-graded vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, their direct sum has underlying vector space &quot;V&quot; ⊕ &quot;W&quot; with gradation
:(&quot;V&quot; ⊕ &quot;W&quot;)&quot;i&quot; = &quot;Vi&quot; ⊕ &quot;Wi&quot; .

If &quot;I&quot; is a semigroup, then the tensor product of two &quot;I&quot;-graded vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; is another &quot;I&quot;-graded vector space, formula_16, with gradation
: formula_17

==Hilbert–Poincaré series==

Given a formula_18-graded vector space that is finite-dimensional for every formula_19 its Hilbert–Poincaré series is the formal power series
:formula_20

From the formulas above, the Hilbert–Poincaré series of a direct sum and of a tensor product 
of graded vector spaces (finite dimensional in each degree) are respectively the sum and the product of the corresponding Hilbert–Poincaré series.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, Menger&#x27;s theorem says that in a finite graph, the size of a minimum cut set is equal to the maximum number of disjoint paths that can be found between any pair of vertices.
Proved by Karl Menger in 1927, it characterizes the connectivity of a graph.
It is generalized by the max-flow min-cut theorem, which is a weighted, edge version, and which in turn is a special case of the strong duality theorem for linear programs.

==Edge connectivity==
The edge-connectivity version of Menger&#x27;s theorem is as follows:

:Let &quot;G&quot; be a finite undirected graph and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; two distinct vertices. Then the size of the minimum edge cut for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;) is equal to the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint paths from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;.

The implication for the graph &quot;G&quot; is the following version:

:A graph is &quot;k&quot;-edge-connected (it remains connected after removing fewer than &quot;k&quot; edges) if and only if every pair of vertices has &quot;k&quot; edge-disjoint paths in between.

==Vertex connectivity==
The vertex-connectivity statement of Menger&#x27;s theorem is as follows:

:Let &quot;G&quot; be a finite undirected graph and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; two nonadjacent vertices. Then the size of the minimum vertex cut for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (the minimum number of vertices, distinct from &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, whose removal disconnects &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;) is equal to the maximum number of pairwise internally disjoint paths from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;.

A consequence for the entire graph &quot;G&quot; is this version:

:A graph is &quot;k&quot;-vertex-connected (it has more than &quot;k&quot; vertices and it remains connected after removing fewer than &quot;k&quot; vertices) if and only if every pair of vertices has at least &quot;k&quot; internally disjoint paths in between.

==Directed graphs==

All these statements in both edge and vertex versions remain true in directed graphs (when considering directed paths).

==Short proof==
Most direct proofs consider a more general statement to allow proving it by induction. It is also convenient to use definitions that include some degenerate cases.
The following proof for undirected graphs works without change for directed graphs or multi-graphs, provided we take &quot;path&quot; to mean directed path.

For sets of vertices &quot;A,B ⊂ G&quot; (not necessarily disjoint), an &quot;AB-path&quot; is a path in &quot;G&quot; with a starting vertex in &quot;A&quot;, a final vertex in &quot;B&quot;, and no internal vertices either in &quot;A&quot; or in &quot;B&quot;. We allow a path with a single vertex in &quot;A ∩ B&quot; and zero edges.
An &quot;AB-separator&quot; of size &quot;k&quot; is a set &quot;S&quot; of &quot;k&quot; vertices (which may intersect &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) such that &quot;G−S&quot; contains no &quot;AB&quot;-path.
An &quot;AB-connector&quot; of size &quot;k&quot; is a union of &quot;k&quot; vertex-disjoint &quot;AB&quot;-paths.

: Theorem: The minimum size of an &quot;AB&quot;-separator is equal to the maximum size of an &quot;AB&quot;-connector.

In other words, if no &quot;k&quot;−1 vertices disconnect &quot;A&quot; from &quot;B&quot;, then there exist &quot;k&quot; disjoint paths from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;.
This variant implies the above vertex-connectivity statement: for &quot;x,y ∈ G&quot; in the previous section, apply the current theorem to &quot;G&quot;−{&quot;x,y&quot;} with &quot;A = N(x)&quot;, &quot;B = N(y)&quot;, the neighboring vertices of &quot;x,y&quot;. Then a set of vertices disconnecting &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is the same thing as an
&quot;AB&quot;-separator, and removing the end vertices in a set of independent &quot;xy&quot;-paths gives an &quot;AB&quot;-connector.

&quot;Proof of the Theorem:&quot;
Induction on the number of edges in &quot;G&quot;.
For &quot;G&quot; with no edges, the minimum &quot;AB&quot;-separator is &quot;A ∩ B&quot;,
which is itself an &quot;AB&quot;-connector consisting of single-vertex paths.

For &quot;G&quot; having an edge &quot;e&quot;, we may assume by induction that the Theorem holds for &quot;G−e&quot;. If &quot;G−e&quot; has a minimal &quot;AB&quot;-separator of size &quot;k&quot;, then there is an &quot;AB&quot;-connector of size &quot;k&quot; in &quot;G−e&quot;, and hence in &quot;G&quot;.

Otherwise, let &quot;S&quot; be a &quot;AB&quot;-separator of &quot;G−e&quot; of size less than &quot;k&quot;,
so that every &quot;AB&quot;-path in &quot;G&quot; contains a vertex of &quot;S&quot; or the edge &quot;e&quot;.
The size of &quot;S&quot; must be &quot;k-1&quot;, since if it was less, &quot;S&quot; together with either endpoint of &quot;e&quot; would be a better &quot;AB&quot;-separator of &quot;G&quot;.
In &quot;G−S&quot; there is an &quot;AB&quot;-path through &quot;e&quot;, since &quot;S&quot; alone is too small to be an &quot;AB&quot;-separator of &quot;G&quot;.
Let &quot;v1&quot; be the earlier and &quot;v2&quot; be the later vertex of &quot;e&quot; on such a path.
Then &quot;v1&quot; is reachable from &quot;A&quot; but not from &quot;B&quot; in &quot;G−S−e&quot;, while &quot;v2&quot; is reachable from &quot;B&quot; but not from &quot;A&quot;.

Now, let &quot;S1 = S ∪ {v1}&quot;, and consider a minimum &quot;AS1&quot;-separator &quot;T&quot; in &quot;G−e&quot;.
Since &quot;v2&quot; is not reachable from &quot;A&quot; in &quot;G−S1&quot;, &quot;T&quot; is also an &quot;AS1&quot;-separator in &quot;G&quot;.
Then &quot;T&quot; is also an &quot;AB&quot;-separator in &quot;G&quot; (because every &quot;AB&quot;-path intersects &quot;S1&quot;).
Hence it has size at least &quot;k&quot;.
By induction, &quot;G−e&quot; contains an &quot;AS1&quot;-connector &quot;C1&quot; of size &quot;k&quot;.
Because of its size, the endpoints of the paths in it must be exactly &quot;S1&quot;.

Similarly, letting &quot;S2 = S ∪ {v2}&quot;, a minimum &quot;S2B&quot;-separator has size &quot;k&quot;, and there is 
an &quot;S2B&quot;-connector &quot;C2&quot; of size &quot;k&quot;, with paths whose starting points are exactly &quot;S2&quot;.

Furthermore, since &quot;S1&quot; disconnects &quot;G&quot;, every path in &quot;C1&quot; is internally disjoint from 
every path in &quot;C2&quot;, and we can define an &quot;AB&quot;-connector of size &quot;k&quot; in &quot;G&quot; by concatenating paths (&quot;k−1&quot; paths through &quot;S&quot; and one path going through &quot;e=v1v2&quot;). Q.E.D.

== Other proofs ==
The directed edge version of the theorem easily implies the other versions.
To infer the directed graph vertex version, it suffices to split each vertex &quot;v&quot; into two vertices &quot;v1&quot;, &quot;v2&quot;, with all ingoing edges going to &quot;v1&quot;, all outgoing edges going from &quot;v2&quot;, and an additional edge from &quot;v1&quot; to &quot;v2&quot;.
The directed versions of the theorem immediately imply undirected versions: it suffices to replace each edge of an undirected graph with a pair of directed edges (a digon).

The directed edge version in turn follows from its weighted variant, the max-flow min-cut theorem.
Its proofs are often correctness proofs for max flow algorithms.
It is also a special case of the still more general (strong) duality theorem for linear programs.

A formulation that for finite digraphs is equivalent to the above formulation is:
: Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be sets of vertices in a finite digraph &quot;G&quot;. Then there exists a family &quot;P&quot; of disjoint &quot;AB&quot;-paths and an &quot;AB&quot;-separating set that consists of exactly one vertex from each path in &quot;P&quot;.

In this version the theorem follows in fairly easily from Kőnig&#x27;s theorem: in a bipartite graph, the minimal size of a cover is equal to the maximal size of a matching.

This is done as follows: replace every vertex &quot;v&quot; in the original digraph &quot;D&quot; by two vertices &quot;v&#x27; &quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;, and every edge &quot;uv&quot; by the edge &quot;u&#x27;v&quot;&quot;; additionally, include the edges &quot;v&#x27;v&quot;&quot; for every vertex &quot;v&quot; that is neither in &quot;A&quot; nor &quot;B&quot;. This results in a bipartite graph, whose one side consists of the vertices &quot;v&#x27; &quot;, and the other of the vertices &quot;v&quot;&quot;.

Applying Kőnig&#x27;s theorem we obtain a matching &quot;M&quot; and a cover &quot;C&quot; of the same size. In particular, exactly one endpoint of each edge of &quot;M&quot; is in &quot;C&quot;. Add to &quot;C&quot; all vertices &quot;a&quot;&quot;, for &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A,&quot; and all vertices &quot;b&#x27; &quot;, for &quot;b&quot; in &quot;B&quot;. Let &quot;P&quot; be the set of all &quot;AB&quot;-paths composed of edges &quot;uv&quot; in &quot;D&quot; such that &quot;u&#x27;v&quot;&quot; belongs to M. Let &quot;Q&quot; in the original graph consist of all vertices &quot;v&quot; such that both &quot;v&#x27; &quot; and &quot;v&quot;&quot; belong to &quot;C&quot;. It is straightforward to check that &quot;Q&quot; is an &quot;AB&quot;-separating set, that every path in the family &quot;P&quot; contains precisely one vertex from &quot;Q&quot;, and every vertex in &quot;Q&quot; lies on a path from &quot;P&quot;, as desired.

==Infinite graphs==
Menger&#x27;s theorem holds for infinite graphs, and in that context it applies to the minimum cut between any two elements that are either vertices or ends of the graph . The following result of Ron Aharoni and Eli Berger was originally a conjecture proposed by Paul Erdős, and before being proved was known as the Erdős–Menger conjecture.
It is equivalent to Menger&#x27;s theorem when the graph is finite.

:Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be sets of vertices in a (possibly infinite) digraph &quot;G&quot;. Then there exists a family &quot;P&quot; of disjoint &quot;A&quot;-&quot;B&quot;-paths and a separating set which consists of exactly one vertex from each path in &quot;P&quot;.

<text>Universe (&quot;Notre univers&quot;) is a 1960 black-and-white documentary short film made in 1960 by Roman Kroitor and Colin Low for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). The NFB writes: &quot;[The film] creates on the screen a vast, awe-inspiring picture of the universe as it would appear to a voyager through space. Realistic animation takes you into far regions of space, beyond the reach of the strongest telescope, past Moon, Sun, and Milky Way into galaxies yet unfathomed.&quot;

This visualization is grounded in the nightly work of Dr. Donald MacRae, an astronomer at the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Using the technology of his era, MacRae prepares his largely manually-operated equipment and then photographs, by long exposure, one star. He actually strikes an arc between iron electrodes and makes a simultaneous exposure, which he can compare to the star&#x27;s spectrum to determine its movement relative to Earth.

==Production==
Roman Kroitor and Colin Low considered making a film about the universe five years before the launch of Sputnik 1. A budget of $60,000 was requested. Don Mulholland, the Director of Production, wanted the film divided into three parts in order to justify its cost. NFB Commissioner Albert Trueman gave the film $20,000 per year, and they put the film on hold once they used up the money for that year. The film was not completed after three years so more money was given with the requirement that it be completed within the next year. The film was completed on 31 March 1960; its budget was $105,146.

==Release==
300 prints of the film were ordered by NASA and the NFB sold over 3,100 copies by 1976. It was one of the more widely distributed educational films ever made.

==Awards==
==Legacy==
After &quot;Universe&quot; was released, Colin Low worked with Stanley Kubrick on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Kubrick chose narrator Douglas Rain as the voice of the HAL 9000 computer and hired cinematographer Wally Gentleman, who did optical effects for &quot;Universe&quot;, to work on &quot;2001&quot;.

According to Kubrick biographer Vincent Lobrutto:
