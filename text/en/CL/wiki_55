<text>Celso Monteiro Furtado (July 26, 1920 – November 20, 2004) was a Brazilian economist and one of the most distinguished intellectuals of the 20th century. His work focuses on development and underdevelopment and on the persistence of poverty in peripheral countries throughout the world. He is viewed, along with Raúl Prebisch, as one of the main formulators of economic structuralism, an economics school that is largely identified with CEPAL, which achieved prominence in Latin America and other developing regions during the 1960s and 1970s and sought to stimulate economic development through governmental intervention, largely inspired on the views of John Maynard Keynes. As a politician, Furtado was appointed Minister of Planning (Goulart government) and Minister of Culture (Sarney government).

==Biography==
Born in Pombal, a city set in the semi-arid region of the state of Paraíba, Celso Furtado moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1939, to study law, and graduated from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in 1944. That same year, he was conscripted to the Brazilian Expeditionary Force to fight in Italy, during World War II, alongside the Allies. Seeing countries destroyed in post-war Europe had a profound impact on him, leading to the decision that he would study Economics: he enrolled in a doctorate program at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), in 1946, and presented a thesis on the economy of Brazil during the colonial period.

In 1949, he moved to Santiago, Chile, where he joined the team of the newly created United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (best known by its Latin American acronym, CEPAL), which was then headed by Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch. While working at CEPAL, Furtado and Prebisch were decisive for the formulation of socioeconomic policies for the development of Latin America which emphasized industrialization and import substitution.

Upon his return to Brazil in 1959, he published his most famous book – &quot;The Economic Growth of Brazil: A Survey from Colonial to Modern Times&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;Formação Econômica do Brasil&quot;) – and was appointed the director of the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDE) in charge of issues concerning states of the northeastern region, which are poor and face chronic droughts and desertification. During this period, he developed a plan which resulted in the creation of the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast (Sudene), a governmental agency that worked to stimulate economic growth in that region, and was appointed by Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek (1956–1961) the agency&#x27;s first director. During the government of president João Goulart (1961–1964), Furtado became Minister of Planning and was responsible for Brazil&#x27;s Triennial Plan of development.

Furtado was also one of the founders of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), an intergovernmental body created in 1964, whose work has since centered around issues related to development and the asymmetries of international trade.

With the Brazilian military coup d&#x27;état, in 1964, he was forced into exile and worked as professor at Yale University, in the United States, and later at Cambridge University and the University of Paris (Sorbonne), in France. After the Law of Amnesty, in 1979, he returned to Brazil and was appointed Ambassador of Brazil at the EEC, in Brussels (1985–1986) and Minister of Culture in the government of president José Sarney (1985–1990).

In 2004, Celso Furtado was nominated to the Nobel Prize of Economics (Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences).

Furtado published more than 30 books during his lifetime.

==Analysis==
&quot;The Economic Growth of Brazil&quot; (original title, &quot;Formação Econômica do Brasil&quot;) is his best known book and considered by many to be a national classic. First published in 1959, it depicts Brazil&#x27;s economic history and the causes of underdevelopment.

In &quot;O Mito do Desenvolvimento Econômico&quot; (The myth of economic development, in Portuguese), published in 1974, Furtado almost prophetically refers to the &quot;globalisation of the world economy&quot; (&quot;mundialização da economia&quot;) when describing the ongoing economic process known today as globalization and raises questions about issues we experience today:

1) The myth of economic development versus the need for natural resources for economic processes: it is mistaken to think that economic development and its benefits will some day reach everyone in the world if the model of economic development does not change. For instance, there are not sufficient natural resources available for everyone in the world if we take as a benchmark the economic model on which the economy was based in the 1970s and is also based currently, i.e. the model where consumerism and individualism are the basis for corporate actions. For instance, if everybody could afford to buy a car, our cities would be completely gridlocked. Furtado&#x27;s critique of the myths of economic development was based on a report of the Club of Rome, which is summarized in Abstract of The limits to Growth: a report to The Club of Rome;

2) On poverty: in countries that have no &quot;central&quot; economies (countries that are not the base for giant corporations), at most 10% of population could reach the level of wealth achieved by people in the richest countries. Peripheral economies, which would not create an independent and more complete economy, would remain poor and experience growing disparities between their poor and their rich inhabitants;

3) On the world economic superstructure: The world superstructure of the capitalist economy (mainly IMF and GATT, which gave rise to the WTO (World Trade Organization) would, on the one hand, increase control over the world economy, also increasing freedom for capital flows and for the actions of big corporations, while, on the other hand, it would reduce the number of possible choices available for governments, mainly for poor country&#x27;s governments. This is the kind of development that has been taking place for the last 30 years.

<text>The ÚV vz. 38 (), manufacturer&#x27;s designation Škoda A7, was a 37 mm tank gun designed by the Skoda Works in Czechoslovakia prior to World War II.

The gun was the primary armament of the Czech LT vz. 38 light tank, known in German service as the Panzer 38(t).

The primary user of the A7 was the Wehrmacht during World War II where the weapon went by the name Kampfwagenkanone 38(t).

==Performance==
In German service, in addition to conventional high explosive ammunition, the weapon fired two anti-tank rounds. The primary round the Panzergranate Pzgr.(t) umg. armor-piercing capped ballistic cap (APCBC), was ineffective at and beyond. The rarer tungsten Panzergranate 40 armor-piercing composite rigid (APCR), was ineffective at and beyond.

<doc id="1173278" wikidata="Q4898274" url="?curid=1173278" title="Betsy Bloomingdale">
<text>Betty Lee Bloomingdale ( Newling; August 2, 1922 – July 19, 2016) was an American socialite and philanthropist. She was considered a fashion icon, first appearing on the International Best Dressed List in 1962, and in 1970 was named in the list&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Early life and marriage==
Bloomingdale was born on August 2, 1922, and was raised in Los Angeles, California. She was the only child of Vera (née Browner) and Russell Lee Newling, both born in Australia. Bloomingdale attended the exclusive Marlborough School in Hancock Park.

On September 14, 1946, she married Alfred S. Bloomingdale, the son of Rosalind (née Schiffer) and Hiram Bloomingdale, and the grandson of Lyman G. Bloomingdale, a co-founder of the famous department store Bloomingdale&#x27;s. The couple settled in Bel Air, Los Angeles and had three children:
*Geoffrey Bloomingdale (born 1950), who married Elizabeth Fahr in 1972
*Lisa Bloomingdale (born 1951), who married R. McKim &quot;Kim&quot; Bell in 1974
*Robert Russell Bloomingdale (born 1954), who married Justine Hayward Schmidt in 1979

==Lifestyle==
In the early 1960s, Bloomingdale began travelling to Paris regularly to view and purchase haute couture clothing. Over the coming decades, she amassed a collection of over 100 gowns and outfits. Bloomingdale was charged by U.S. customs officials for falsely declaring the value of two imported Dior haute couture gowns in 1975. She pleaded guilty to concealing an invoice from federal customs officials and was fined.

When her husband died of cancer, a media scandal ensued over his estate. Bloomingdale had cut off a financial allowance to her husband&#x27;s mistress Vicki Morgan in 1981. On his death, Morgan took her 12-year relationship with Alfred public. She sued his estate and widow for $10 million, claiming that Alfred had promised her lifetime support. Most of the suit was dismissed in 1983, but after Morgan was murdered the following year, a jury awarded $200,000 to her estate. Bloomingdale&#x27;s life, marriage and the affair were the basis of Dominick Dunne&#x27;s novel &quot;An Inconvenient Woman&quot;.

Bloomingdale was a frequent party host, mainly for charity, for which she was dubbed &quot;Good Queen Betts&quot;. She was well known for her attention to detail, keeping copious notes of each dinner party she hosted, including a photo of the place setting, the menu, the seating arrangement, and her outfit, so that guests would never dine on the same dishes or see her in the same gown twice. Bloomingdale published a book on entertaining and hosting, &quot;Entertaining With Betsy Bloomingdale: A Collection of Culinary Tips and Treasures From the World’s Best Hosts and Hostesses&quot;, in 1994.

Her social circle included Nancy Reagan, Joan Collins, Joan Rivers, Lauren Bacall and Nan Kempner. Her friendship with Reagan began in the 1950s, and was so close that Bloomingdale became known as the &quot;First Friend&quot; during the Reagan presidency. She frequently provided fashion, decorating and style advice to the First Lady.

A practicing Roman Catholic, she was involved in fundraising projects for the Los Angeles Cathedral, and also contributed to the funding for the development of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. She was also a member of the elite charitable group The Colleagues, which funded homes for unmarried mothers and their children.

She was the subject of an exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in 2009. The exhibition, called &quot;High Style: Betsy Bloomingdale and the Haute Couture,&quot; displayed 60 of her haute couture gowns. 

==Death==
Bloomingdale died on July 19, 2016, at her home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, from complications from a heart condition. She was 93 years old.

As their floor general and top perimeter defender, he led the New York Knicks to the franchise&#x27;s only two championships (1970 and 1973), and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. Upon his retirement from basketball, Frazier went into broadcasting; he is currently a color commentator for telecasts of Knicks games on the MSG Network. In 1996, Frazier was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team. In October 2021, Frazier was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Walt Frazier was also named the MVP of the first of two All-Star games played between ABA and NBA players in May 1971.

==Early life==
Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Frazier Jr. was born on March 29, 1945, in Atlanta, Georgia. The eldest of nine children, Frazier attended Atlanta&#x27;s David Tobias Howard High School. He quarterbacked the football team, and played catcher on the baseball team. He learned basketball on a rutted and dirt playground, the only facility available at his all-black school in the racially segregated South of the 1950s.

==College career==
Although he was offered other scholarships for his football skills, Frazier accepted a basketball offer from Southern Illinois University, saying that &quot;there were no black quarterbacks, so I played basketball.&quot;

Frazier became one of the premier collegiate basketball players in the country. He was named a Division II All-American in 1964 and 1965. As a sophomore in 1965, Frazier led SIU to the NCAA Division II Tournament, only to lose in the finals to Jerry Sloan and the Evansville Purple Aces 85–82 in overtime. In 1966, he was academically ineligible for basketball.

SIU and Frazier won the National Invitation Tournament, defeating Marquette University, 71–56, in the final, in the last college basketball game played at the old Madison Square Garden in New York. Southern Illinois was playing in their final season as a College Division team, and became the only non-Division I/University Division team to win the NIT. After the NCAA began operating the NIT in 2006, non-Division I teams were no longer eligible to participate. Frazier was named Most Valuable Player of the 1967 tournament.

==Professional career==

=== New York Knicks (1967–1977) ===
Frazier was drafted fifth overall by the New York Knicks in the NBA (as well as drafted in the first round by the Denver Rockets in the upstart American Basketball Association), going on to average 9.0 points per game and be named to the NBA All-Rookie Team during the 1967–68 season. During his rookie season with the Knicks, he picked up the nickname &quot;Clyde&quot; because he wore a fedora similar to that worn by Warren Beatty in his portrayal of Clyde Barrow in the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.

As a sophomore, Frazier&#x27;s 17.5 points, 7.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game averages made him one of the most improved players in the league.
On October 30, 1969, Frazier recorded 43 points to go along with 9 rebounds and 5 assists in a 123–110 win over the Houston Rockets. Frazier was chosen as an NBA All-Star during the 1969–70 season, the first of seven selections during his 10-year stint with the Knicks.

The Knicks made it to the 1970 NBA Finals thanks to the great play of both Frazier and star teammate Willis Reed. However, in game five, Reed suffered a painful leg injury. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scoring the Knicks&#x27; first four points before limping off. With Reed out, Frazier went on to post one of the greatest performances in NBA playoff history, tallying 36 points, seven rebounds, 19 assists, and six steals in leading New York to victory in what is referred to by ESPN as one of the best game sevens ever played.
The Knicks were unable to repeat as champions in 1971, falling to the Baltimore Bullets and their star shooting guard Earl Monroe in the second round of the playoffs despite Frazier&#x27;s 20.4 points per game average during the series.

During the off-season, in May 1971, Frazier scored 26 points and was named MVP of an exhibition game played between NBA and ABA All-Stars in Houston&#x27;s Astrodome.

Following the 1970–71 season, the Knicks traded for Monroe, who was always difficult for Frazier to guard. Not many people thought the two players’ styles would mesh, but Monroe and Frazier soon became one of the best backcourts in the league, even earning the nickname the &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; backcourt.

The Knicks returned to the NBA Finals in 1972, but fell to the Los Angeles Lakers, who completed a record-setting season with an NBA championship.

Frazier led the Knicks to a second NBA championship in 1973, topping the Lakers in a five-game series. His defense on Jerry West played a major role in defeating the star-filled team.

In 1976, Frazier was selected for his seventh and final NBA All-Star Game.

Frazier held Knicks franchise records for most games (759), minutes played (28,995), field goals attempted (11,669), field goals made (5,736), free throws attempted (4,017), free throws made (3,145), assists (4,791) and points (14,617). Patrick Ewing eventually broke most of those records, but Frazier&#x27;s assists record still stands.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (1977–1979) ===
Frazier was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers after the 1976–77 season for the younger Jim Cleamons. The trade left Frazier stunned, and he later commented that &quot;It was like getting traded to Siberia.&quot;

Due in part to repeated foot injuries, Frazier played only 66 games over the course of three seasons with the Cavaliers. He retired midway through the 1979–80 season, when he only played 3 games and averaged career-lows of 3.3 points and 2.7 assists before being waived.

==Style==
Since the late 1960s, Frazier has been known for being a fashion icon, and was one of the first major pro athletes to be acclaimed as such. The website Clyde So Fly catalogs and grades every suit he wears while broadcasting New York Knicks games on the MSG Network.

Frazier has a line of Puma sneakers named after him. The first Puma Clyde was released in 1973. Until that time, the Converse Chuck Taylor, launched in 1917, was the only basketball sneaker bearing a player&#x27;s name. Frazier, then, is the first modern NBA star to have his own line of sneakers. The promotional material references Frazier&#x27;s &quot;signature colorful style&quot;.

Frazier&#x27;s loquacious, rhyming broadcast commentary has become part and parcel of his image. His phrase &quot;posting and toasting&quot; — a description of player moving close to the basket and scoring over a rival — inspired the name of the popular Knicks blog, postingandtoasting.com. And his phrase for playing tough defense, &quot;tenacious D,&quot; provided the name for actor Jack Black&#x27;s humorous musical duo Tenacious D.

==Personal life==
Frazier lives in Harlem with his long-term girlfriend, Patricia James, and they also have a home in St. Croix. He is the father of a son referred to both as Walt Jr. and, later, Walt III. Frazier is a member of the fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.

<doc id="1173285" wikidata="Q3335437" url="?curid=1173285" title="Nambu pistol">
<text>are a series of semi-automatic pistols produced by the Japanese company Koishikawa Arsenal, later known as the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal. The series has three variants, the Type A, the Type B (also known as the Baby Nambu), and the Type 14 (十四年式拳銃, &quot;Jūyon nen shiki kenjū&quot;). The Nambu pistols were designed to replace Japan&#x27;s earlier service pistol, the Type 26 revolver.

The pistols were designed by Kijirō Nambu and saw extensive service in the Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War and Pacific War. The most common variant, the Type 14, was used mostly by officers, who had to pay for their pistols themselves.

==History==
Prior to the design of the Nambu, the only pistol in Japanese service was the Type 26 revolver, which served with distinction during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). However, in the 1890s, semi-automatic pistol designs began to emerge. Among them was the Mauser C96, which was influential in the production of the Nambu, as it uses the same locking mechanism as the C96. The Nambu was designed shortly after a Japanese commission reported on European military developments.

The first Nambu, the Type A, was completed in 1902. This version was never adopted, but some were sold to China and Siam. The Type B was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy and Royal Thai Army during the 1920s and the later Type 14 was adopted in 1926 (Taishō 14) as the service pistol of the Imperial Japanese Army until its surrender in 1945. Nambu pistols were symbols of prestige, often carried in fanciful holsters, and were used more as a means of ornament and status rather than for fighting. Japan produced about 400,000 Nambu pistols over the course of the war and the United States made over a million M1911 pistols. 

Alongside other Japanese weapons, such as &quot;guntōs&quot; and Arisaka rifles, many American servicemen took Nambu pistols home with them as war trophies. Production of Nambu pistols ceased after the end of the war and Nambu pistols were replaced by M1911A1s provided by the US to the Japan Self-Defense Forces and police.

==Design==

The Nambu pistol is a recoil operated, locked breech, semi-automatic pistol. The Type A and 14 Nambus have magazine capacities of eight rounds, whereas the Type B has seven. A common flaw in the series was that the gun&#x27;s safety catch and its magazine release did not enable the magazine to slide out of the gun once it was empty, forcing the operator to work against the weight of the recoil spring and leaf spring, making reloading difficult. The magazine catch was removed from the Type 14. Another issue with the safety was that it is located just above the trigger guard, meaning that it can not be activated with the same hand that is holding the pistol.

The grip on the Nambu is slanted, which makes feeding the magazine a delicate procedure. The magazine spring is only about 60% effective, and the bullets moving against the walls of the magazine cause frictional loss, weakening the spring further. Furthermore, the size of the bullets has to be exact; soft point and cast lead bullets fail to chamber properly.

The Nambu pistol uses the 8×22mm Nambu cartridge, which made it substantially weaker than other handguns. The 8 mm round&#x27;s muzzle energy is less than half that of the 9×19mm Parabellum (used in the Walther P38), and the 7.62×25mm Tokarev (used in the TT-33). 

===Type A===
The first type of Nambu that was produced was the Type A. Type A Nambus produced from 1903-1906 have differences from those produced after 1906, and, among collectors, the original Nambus are commonly referred to as &quot;Grandpa&quot; Nambus. The &quot;Grandpa&quot; Type A was produced until around serial number 2,400. Production of the Type A Nambu ceased as of 1923, as the Type 14 was both cheaper and more effective. The Nambu Type A somewhat resembles the Luger pistol in appearance, but this is superficial. The Type A had a provision that allowed for the installation of a stock, as seen on the Mauser C96. The stocks could be used as holsters as they were designed to fit a Type A inside of them. These were hand fitted, so interchangeability is limited. The stocks were serialized to the pistol.

A later version of the Type A Nambu, the Type A modified, also known as the &quot;Papa&quot; Nambu, was produced until around serial number 7,000. The trigger guard of the &quot;Grandpa&quot; Nambu was enlarged in later models. Some &quot;Papa&quot; Nambu had stock attachment slots, with four known.

===Type B===

Due to failings with the Type A Nambu, an improvement, the Type B, was devised. Both the pistol itself, and the round it fired, are smaller than the other Nambu pistols, leading to the name &quot;Baby&quot; Nambu. Type B Nambus were produced at the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal. The first 450 models have the bottom part of the magazine made of wood, and only one diameter firing pin, but later Type Bs have the magazine made from aluminium, and incorporate a multiple diameter firing pin. The Type B Nambu was never adopted officially by any Japanese armed forces. As was customary in the Imperial Japanese Army, officers paid for pistols with their own salaries, but the Type B Nambu was unable to achieve market success as it was twice the price of a comparable imported pistol, such as the FN M1900. A Type B Nambu sold for 180 yen, making it cost roughly the same as a captain&#x27;s entire monthly salary. After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, Koishikawa Arsenal stopped producing new parts for Type B Nambus, but continued to assemble ones with existing parts until 1929.

===Type 14===

The Type 14 Nambu gets its name from the year it was produced - the 14th year of the Taishō era, or 1926. It was designed to help lower the manufacturing cost of the Nambus, and like the Type A, fires the 8×22mm Nambu. From 1927, it was a standard issue sidearm for officers and was being sold for 78 yen by 1939. It is believed that around 400,000 Type 14 Nambus were produced, but the exact number is unknown, as Japanese soldiers considered their weapons property of the emperor, and many chose to destroy their pistols or throw them into the ocean to avoid them falling into enemy hands. 

Later production models have a larger trigger guard, following complaints by soldiers stationed in Manchukuo that it was difficult to fire the trigger while wearing gloves. Some of these models also have a knurled steel cocking knob instead of the standard &quot;slotted&quot; cocking knob. After 1940, an auxiliary magazine spring was added to assist in reloading. A redesigned cocking knob was implemented in 1944 to simplify production. The Type 14 also lacks the grip safety used on the previous models.

Pre-1937 Type 14s are well made, with a noticeable decline in quality after the war&#x27;s beginning, to meet wartime production demands. However, later Type 14s remained mostly functional despite the decreased quality. The holsters for the pistols also had to be changed to accommodate wartime. A lack of available raw materials resulted in a move from holsters made of leather to rubberized canvas.

==Legacy==
In 1949, William B. Ruger took design elements of the Nambu in his own design, which became the Ruger Standard. This was the first weapon designed by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. The Ruger Standard would become the most successful .22LR pistol ever produced, and as of 2016, Ruger&#x27;s company produced more firearms than any other American company, and was worth over $600 million.

Because of their rarity and historical significance, Nambu pistols became sought after by gun collectors, with models selling anywhere from $800 to $1,500.

== In popular culture ==

In &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, the character Cara Dune uses a Nambu pistol, modified to fit the sci-fi setting.

<doc id="1173286" wikidata="Q44927" url="?curid=1173286" title="Joseph Lanner">
<text>Joseph Lanner (12 April 1801 – 14 April 1843) was an Austrian dance music composer and dance orchestra conductor. He is best remembered as one of the earliest Viennese composers to reform the waltz from a simple peasant dance to something that even the highest society could enjoy, either as an accompaniment to the dance, or for the music&#x27;s own sake. He was just as famous as his friend and musical rival Johann Strauss I, who was better known outside of Austria in their day because of his concert tours abroad, in particular, to France and England.

Lanner had a lesser-known son, August Lanner, who was just as musically gifted and prodigious as his father, but whose budding career was cut short by his early death at age 20. His daughter Katharina became a well known international ballet dancer, settling in London where she became an influential choreographer and teacher.

==Biography==

Lanner was born in St. Ulrich in Vienna (today the district of Neubau). Largely self-taught on the violin, he joined a small string orchestra of Michael Pamer at about the same time as Johann Strauss I did, although he decided to venture into the music business himself and partnered with Karl and Johann Drahanek, forming a quartet that bore his name. The success of this string quartet led to its gradual expansion, and in 1824 Lanner was able to conduct a small string orchestra playing Viennese dance music. Such was the success of his orchestra that it was a regular feature in many Vienna carnivals, popularly known in the local dialect as the Fasching. It was in 1832 that Lanner allowed his soon-to-be rival Johann Strauss I to deputise in a second, smaller orchestra that was formed that year to meet the busy schedule of the Carnival activities.

Lanner was already gaining a reputation at the end of the 1825 Carnival season and Strauss I was frustrated at having to deputise when necessary and as a result, his works were not getting the recognition he thought they deserved. In the same year, Strauss I parted company with Lanner after a concert at one of the Viennese dance establishments, (The Black Ram). Although many press reports stated a furious encounter between the two composers including a rumor that Strauss forcibly departed the orchestra with a few of Lanner&#x27;s talented musicians, these remained largely unsubstantiated as Lanner had earlier dedicated a waltz to Strauss entitled &quot;Trennungs-Walzer&quot; (&quot;Separation Waltz&quot;), Op. 19, which indicated a decent level of goodwill and respect for the craft of the two composers. Further, Lanner and Strauss I worked together often despite having severed their partnership and even gave a benefit concert for their former employer, Michael Pamer who was taken ill in 1826 at the same establishment where they separated. For their charity work Strauss and Lanner also accepted the honorary citizenship of Vienna in 1836 and jointly took the Citizen&#x27;s Oath.

The music-loving Viennese however were championing both of these two popular dance music composers, and individuals generally identified themselves as &quot;Lannerianer&quot; or &quot;Straussianer&quot;. In fact, it was believed that the ruling Habsburg dynasty was anxious to divert its Viennese populace from politics and the revolutionary ideas that were feverishly sweeping Europe, with many cities preparing to overthrow any unpopular monarch. The answer would be to distract the population with music and entertainment, and the musical positions that both Lanner and Strauss held were soon seen to be very important. Lanner himself was appointed to the coveted post of of the in the Hofburg Imperial Palace of which his primary duties were to conduct concerts held in honor of the nobility and to compose new works for the Court orchestra.

Strauss&#x27;s popularity soon overshadowed Lanner&#x27;s in the early 1840s. Strauss was eager to undertake extensive lucrative tours abroad including England, whereas Lanner held on in Vienna unconvinced that the other nationalities were prepared to listen to Viennese music. Lanner succumbed to a typhus infection that racked Vienna in 1843 and died at Döbling on Good Friday, 14 April, in the same year. The famous rivalry with Strauss I had ended; Lanner&#x27;s death marked the beginning of a period where the Strauss family was to dominate the Viennese dance music scene for well over a half a century and concluded an era of interesting and exciting developments for the waltz and other popular dance music.

==Compositions==
Among Lanner&#x27;s more popular works are the &quot;Pesther-Walzer&quot;, Op. 93, &quot;Hofballtänze Walzer&quot;, Op. 161, &quot;Die Werber&quot; Waltz, Op. 103, &quot;Die Romantiker&quot; Waltz, Op. 167, and probably his most well-known work, &quot;Die Schönbrunner&quot; Walzer, Op. 200, probably the most famous of all waltzes before &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; by Johann Strauss II in the mid-1860s. Most of Lanner&#x27;s waltzes were dedicated to members of the nobility as evidenced from the titles which was part of the nature of Lanner&#x27;s position at that time. His &quot;Styrian Dances&quot; (Steyrische-Tänze), Op. 165, was also played occasionally at the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

<text>Dorothy Tennant, Lady Stanley (22 March 1855 – 5 October 1926) was an English painter of the Victorian era neoclassicism. She was married to explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley.

==Biography==
Tennant was born in Russell Square, London, the second daughter of Charles Tennant and Gertrude Barbara Rich Collier (1819–1918). Her sister was the photographer, Eveleen Tennant Myers. She studied painting under Edward Poynter at the Slade School of Fine Art, London and with Jean-Jacques Henner in Paris. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 and subsequently at the New Gallery and the Grosvenor Gallery in London. Outside of London Tennant featured in exhibitions by the Fine Art Society in Glasgow and also in the Autumn Exhibitions held in Liverpool and Manchester.

In 1890, she married Sir Henry Morton Stanley, and became known as Lady Stanley. She edited her husband&#x27;s autobiography, reportedly removing any references to other women in Stanley&#x27;s life. After Sir Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s death, his widow remarried, in 1907, to Henry Jones Curtis (died 19 February 1944), a pathologist, surgeon and writer.

Lady Stanley was also an author and illustrator, including &quot;London Street Arabs&quot; in 1890.

She died of heart failure on 5 October 1926.

<doc id="1173297" wikidata="Q1664042" url="?curid=1173297" title="Inner child">
<text>In some schools of popular psychology and analytical psychology, the inner child is an individual&#x27;s childlike aspect. It includes what a person learned as a child before puberty. The inner child is often conceived as a semi-independent subpersonality subordinate to the waking conscious mind. The term has therapeutic applications in counseling and health settings. The concept became known to a broader audience through books by John Bradshaw and others.

==Origins==
One method of reparenting the inner child in therapy was originated by art therapist Lucia Capacchione in 1976 and documented in her book &quot;Recovery of Your Inner Child&quot; (1991). Using art therapy and journaling techniques, her method includes a &quot;nurturing parent&quot; and &quot;protective parent&quot; within &quot;inner family work&quot; to care for a person&#x27;s physical, emotional, creative and spiritual needs (her definition of the inner child). It also posits a &quot;critical parent within&quot; and provides tools for managing it. Charles L. Whitfield dubbed the inner child the &quot;child within&quot; in his book &quot;Healing the Child Within: Discovery and Recovery for Adult Children of Dysfunctional Families&quot; (1987). Penny Park&#x27;s book &quot;Rescuing the Inner Child&quot; (1990) provided a program for contacting and recovering the inner child.

In his television shows, and in books such as &quot;Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner Child&quot; (1990), John Bradshaw, a U.S. educator, pop psychology and self-help movement leader, used &quot;inner child&quot; to point to unresolved childhood experiences and the lingering dysfunctional effects of childhood dysfunction: the sum of mental-emotional memories stored in the sub-conscious from conception thru pre-puberty.

==Further developments==
Within the framework of psychosynthesis, the inner child is often characterized as a subpersonality or may also be seen as a central element surrounded by subpersonalities.

Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS therapy) posits that there is not just one inner child sub-personality, but many. IFS therapy calls wounded inner child sub-personalities &quot;exiles&quot; because they tend to be excluded from waking thought in order to avoid/defend against the pain carried in those memories. IFS therapy has a method that aims to gain safe access to a person&#x27;s exiles, witnessing the stories of their origins in childhood, and healing them.

<text>Kandukuri Veeresalingam (16 April 1848 27 May 1919) is a social reformer and writer from the Madras Presidency, British India, current Andhra Pradesh . He is considered as the Father of the Telugu Renaissance movement. He was one of the early social reformers who encouraged the education of women and the remarriage of widows (which was not supported by society during his time). He also fought against child marriage and the dowry system. He started a school in Dowlaiswaram in 1874, constructed the &#x27;Brahmo Mandir&#x27; in 1887 and built the &#x27;Hithakarini School&#x27; in 1908 in Andhra Pradesh. His novel &quot;Rajasekhara Charitramu&quot; is considered to be the first novel in Telugu literature.

He is often considered Raja Ram Mohan Roy of Andhra. He was known by the title Gadya Tikkana, or ‘the Tikkana of Prose&#x27;.

== Early life ==
Kandukuri veeresalingam was born into a Telugu-speaking Brahmin family in Rajahmundry, Madras Presidency, to Subbarayudu and Poornamma. When he was six months old, he had smallpox, a dangerous disease during that time, and when aged four his father died. He was adopted by his paternal uncle, Venkataratnam. After studying in an Indian street school, he was sent to English medium school where his talent was recognised. His good nature and studiousness earned him the best student award in his school. He completed his matriculation in 1869 and got his first job as a teacher in Korangi village.

== Literature ==
Veeresalingam was a scholar in Telugu, Sanskrit, and Hindi. Considering literature as an instrument to fight against social evils, his writings also reflected the same. He wrote plays such as &quot;Prahlada&quot;(1886) and &quot;Satya Harischandra&quot; (1886). He published a novel &quot;Rajasekhara Charitamu&quot; in 1880, originally serialised in &quot;Viveka Chandrika&quot; from 1878. Generally recognised as the first Telugu novel, it is inspired by &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;, a novel by the Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith

His works include:
* &quot;Rajasekhara Charitramu&quot;, first novel in Telugu
* &#x27;Viveka Vardhini&#x27;, a journal for women education in 1887.
* &#x27;Satihita bodhini&#x27;, a monthly magazine for women.
* the first drama in Telugu and first book in Telugu on sciences &amp; history.

== Brahmo Samaj ==
Kandukuri Veeresalingam was inspired by the principles of Brahmo Samaj leaders like Raja Rammohan Roy, Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, &amp; Keshab Chandra Sen. He started Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s first Brahmo Mandir in Rajahmundry in 1887.

== Social reformer ==

=== Supporting Women ===
One of the greatest reforms of Veeresalingam was to promote women&#x27;s education, which was a taboo in those days. In 1876, he started a journal called &quot;Viveka Vardhini&quot; and published articles about women&#x27;s issues of that area. The magazine was initially printed in Chennai (then Madras), but with his writings gaining popularity, he established his own press at Rajahmundry.

Remarriage of widows was not appreciated in the society during those days, and he opposed this practice by quoting verses from the Hindu Dharma Sastra to prove his point. His opponents used to organise special meetings and debates to counter his arguments, and even resorted to physical violence against him when they failed to stop him. Undeterred, Veeresalingam started a Remarriage Association and sent his students all over Andhra Pradesh to find young single men willing to marry widows. He arranged the first widow remarriage on 11 December 1881. For his reformist activities, Kandukuri gained attention all over the country. The Government, in appreciation of his work, conferred on him the title of Rao Bahadur in 1893. Later he established a home for widows.

As per N. Putali Krishnamurthi, Veeresalingam was probably inspired by the writings of Muddu Narasimham Naidu who pioneered the widow remarriage movement and the rationalist movement in Andhra.

==Politics==
Kandukuri Veeresalingam was one of the attendees of the first Indian National Congress (INC) meeting in 1885.

== Personal life ==
Kandukuri Veeresalingam was married to Bapamma Rajyalakshmi in 1861. At the time of marriage, he was 14 years old and she was 9.

== Death ==

Veeresalingam died on 27 May 1919 at the age of 71. His statue has been unveiled on the Beach Road in Vishakhapatnam. In his memory, the Indian Postal service issued a 25-paisa postage stamp in 1974.

<text>The Škoda 149 mm K series was a line of heavy howitzer designs used by Germany, Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia during World War II.

==Description==
The K-series howitzers were modern designs for their time, with a powerful 149.1 mm calibre barrel mounted on a heavy field carriage designed for motorized transport. The K1 model was slightly longer and could be disassembled for horse carrying as well. The K4 model was more modern and used pneumatic wheels as opposed to the K1&#x27;s solid rubber rims. Both howitzers used spade plates that had to be pounded into the ground to anchor the weapon in place.

==History==
The K series was an entirely new design by the Škoda Works company of Czechoslovakia. The original K1 model was in production by 1933, and was a successful export weapon, with sales to Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia. However, the Czechoslovak Army was not a buyer, but desired modifications to the weapon before any purchase. The newer weapon was titled the K4 and was accepted by the Czechoslovak Army as its standard heavy howitzer intended to replace the large variety of World War I era pieces still on inventory. In Czech service it received the designation 15 cm hrubá houfnice vzor 37 and had just begun production when Czechoslovakia capitulated to Germany in 1939. The Germans continued production for service in the Wehrmacht as the 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze 37(t) or sFH 37(t). The weapon was widely used, particularly on the Eastern Front, and some had been supplied to Axis-allied powers such as Slovakia. Yugoslav K1 guns captured by Germany were given the designation sFH 402(j).

Romania purchased a total of 180 pieces between 1936 and 1939, designated as M34. Romania was not able to produce the whole piece by itself, but its Astra Works did manage to produce the gun barrel. Gun barrels of 150 mm were produced by Astra during the war for the replacement of damaged/worn-out barrels.

<text>Talk was an American magazine published from 1999 to 2002. The magazine gained notoriety for its celebrity profiles and interviews. The magazine was a joint venture of Miramax&#x27;s Talk Media and Hearst Magazines. Hearst would manage circulation, manufacturing, newsstand distribution and subscription fulfillment. Talk Media was in charge of advertising sales, editorial content and marketing.

==History and profile==
Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by Miramax Films, Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publish books, the &quot;Talk&quot; magazine and to produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with Hearst Magazines for the magazine only in February 1999.

The first issue of &quot;Talk&quot; appeared in September 1999. The cover story of the debut issue was an interview with Hillary Clinton, which took place shortly after the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, in which she explained that her husband Bill Clinton had a chronic need to please women. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that at times, &quot;&quot;Talk&quot; seemed more interested in promoting such Miramax stars as Gwyneth Paltrow than in politics.&quot;

The magazine never became a commercial success, and its publication was suspended after the final February 2002 issue. Politico estimated that Brown had &quot;bombed through some $50 million in 2 1/2 years&quot; on the failed venture. A $1 million contract settlement in 2002 ended Brown&#x27;s involvement in Talk Media.

<text>Andritsaina () is a village, a community and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andritsaina-Krestena, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 131.247 km2.

==Geography==

Andritsaina is situated in mountainous southeastern Elis, on the borders with Arcadia and Messenia. The town is built on a hillside, northwest of mount Lykaion. The river Alfeios forms the northeastern border of the municipal unit. The predominant land uses in the municipal unit are forestry and small scale farming. Andritsaina is 22 km northwest of Megalopoli, 28 km southeast of Krestena, 41 km west of Tripoli and 46 km southeast of Pyrgos. The Greek National Road 76 (Krestena - Karytaina - Megalopoli) runs through Andritsaina.

==History==
According to tradition, Andritsaina owes its name to the wife of a Cretan shepherd named Andrikos, who -chasing his runaway sheep- came to a spring on mount Lykaion. There he built an inn that after his death was kept by his wife Andrikaina (meaning &quot;the wife of Andrikos&quot;). From her name and from the local pronunciation of &quot;kai&quot; as &quot;tsai&quot;, the inn was named &quot;the hostel of Andritsaina&quot;. When houses were built in the surrounding area, the settlement was named &quot;Andritsaina&quot;.

The area was part of ancient Arcadia. Andritsaina flourished during the Frankish rule (13th-14th centuries AD) and is mentioned in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;. The village played a crucial role during the Orlov Revolt and the Greek War of Independence. In 1826, Andritsaina was destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s troops.

==Sights==
Today, the village has impressive old mansions, cobblestone streets, a square surrounded by tall trees and magnificent views. The fountain in the square (&quot;I Trani Vrysi&quot;) is the Peloponnese&#x27;s oldest fountain, built in 1724. The famous Nikolopouleios library was founded in 1840 from donations of the humanist Agathofron Nikolopoulos, whose family came from Andritsaina. Its collection comprises rare 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, in Greek and in foreign languages, important documents from the period of the Greek War of Independence and rich folklore material. Today, the library has more than 40,000 volumes. The famous Temple of Epicurian Apollo at Bassae is 6 km south of Andritsaina, in Messenia.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Andritsaina is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Andritsaina (Andritsaina, Karmio, Myloi, Sykies)
*Dafnoula (Dafnoula, Chelidoni)
*Dragogio (Dragogio, Kastrougkaina, Plateia)
*Fanari
*Koufopoulo
*Linistaina
*Matesi
*Rovia
*Sekoulas (Sekoulas, Balaiika)
*Theisoa

The community Andritsaina consists of the main village Andritsaina and the small mountain villages Karmio (3 km to the northeast), Myloi (4 km to the northwest) and Sykies (5 km to the north).

==Population==
==People==

*Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos, revolutionary leader

<text>SolarQuest is a space-age real estate trading board game published in 1985 and developed by Valen Brost, who conceived the idea in 1976. The game is patterned after &quot;Monopoly&quot;, but it replaces pewter tokens with rocket ships and hotels with metallic fuel stations. Players travel around the Sun acquiring monopolies of planets, moons, and man-made space structures. They seek to knock their opponents out of the game through bankruptcy, as well as optional laser blasts and dwindling fuel supplies.

&quot;SolarQuest&quot; has attracted a renewed following in recent years due to its availability on eBay and other auction sites. Brost ran a successful Kickstarter campaign (November 8 – December 25, 2016) to fund his new release of &quot;SolarQuest&quot;, expected to enter production in 2017. This &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; will include more up-to-date astronomical data, a magnetic Fuel Tank Card (preventing the accidental movement of its metal markers), modernized graphics, and enhanced gameplay.

== Gameplay (original 1985/1987 versions) ==

=== Mission ===
Players travel through the Solar System acquiring properties, charging rent, and building fuel stations within individual planetary systems. The winner is the player who builds the greatest financial empire and &quot;survives the perils of space travel to become the last player on the board,&quot; according to the 1986 &quot;SolarQuest&quot; rules.

=== Game board ===

A journey around the Sun encompasses:
* 33 moons;
* 9 planets, of which 5 can be landed on;
* 9 federation stations;
* 6 research labs; and
* 5 space docks.

Players roll dice and travel along a blue flight path from planet to planet. There are also Red Shift cards directing players to specific destinations (e.g. Advance to Mars).

Players can buy planets and moons, and trade with one another to acquire monopolies. They can also build fuel stations on these bodies, and charge fees for refueling. Each planet has a deed card with instructions on rent and fuel costs.

Research labs and space docks are similar to the utilities in &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Federation stations cannot be owned, but offer an opportunity to collect cash and purchase spare fuel stations.

There are also 16 black dots, representing planets&#x27; gravity, and 17 blue dots, representing floating in space. Altogether, the board has a total of 91 spaces (compared to &quot;Monopoly&quot;&#x27;s 40).

=== Color groups ===

The color groups are:
* Orange (Jupiter&#x27;s moons): Callisto, Ganymede, Io, Europa, Amalthea, Himalia, Elara, Thebe, Metis, Adrastea, Sinope.
* Yellow (Saturn&#x27;s moons): Titan, Rhea, Iapetus, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, Mimas, Hyperion, Phoebe, Janus.
* Turquoise (Uranus&#x27; moons): Oberon, Titania, Ariel, Umbriel, Miranda, 1985 U1.
* Red: Mars, Phobos, Deimos.
* Pink: Pluto, Charon.
* Blue (Neptune&#x27;s moons): Triton, Nereid.
* Purple: Venus.
* Gold: Mercury.
* Green: Earth (cannot be purchased), Moon.
* Grey: Earth Research Lab, Neptune Research Lab, Uranus Research Lab, Venus Research Lab, Jupiter Research Lab, Saturn Research Lab.
* White: Solar Space Dock, Neptune Space Dock, Saturn Space Dock, Uranus Space Dock, Jupiter Space Dock.

=== Fuel ===
Players have to watch their fuel level carefully since getting stranded with no way to refuel means the loss of the game. Fuel is only used when leaving a planet or moon. According to the rules, &quot;This occurs because the ship must escape the gravitational pull of the planet or moon.&quot; Thus, fuel is not used when leaving a manmade satellite or an empty space.

It is always good to have spare fuel stations on hand. If a player runs out of fuel after landing on a planet that has no fuel station, they can force the sale of the property, build a fuel station, and replenish their fuel tank.

=== Laser battles ===
A suggested variation is that players who are close enough to each other can fire lasers. A roll of doubles damages the ship, allowing the aggressor to charge for repairs. A roll of double sixes completely destroys the opposing ship, knocking them out of the game.

=== Red shift ===

==== Basic &quot;Solarquest&quot; ====
A Red Shift card is drawn when a player rolls doubles. For the &quot;Apollo 13&quot; edition, redshift cards are only drawn when a one and a three are rolled, greatly reducing the amount of redshift cards drawn during gameplay. Rolling doubles allows for a second turn and a $100 Federon reward instead. These are similar to the Chance or Community Chest cards in &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The 36 Red Shift cards consist of:
* 25 cards directing the player to a specific destination (e.g. Advance to Federation Station II orbiting Jupiter – use 1 hydron of fuel)
* 3 cards in the Red Shift series (e.g. Red Shift 4 – Roll dice – Move 4 times the number rolled – use 4 hydrons of fuel)
* 5 cards awarding or taking away property (e.g. A player wins a dispute with the Federation League – choose any unowned property and assume ownership from the Federation)
* 3 miscellaneous cards (e.g. Discover new comet – Collect $400 (Roll Again)).

==== Strategic &quot;Solarquest&quot; ====

The rules also provide for an &quot;Advanced Play&quot; variant known as &quot;Strategic Solarquest&quot; in which
Red Shift cards are only drawn if double sixes are rolled. If another set of doubles is rolled (e.g. 1-1, 2-2, etc.) the player collects 100 federons, moves the number of spaces corresponding to the pips on the dice, and then has the option of either landing on that space or &quot;bypassing&quot; it and rolling again. Bypassing it means that the player does not pay rent, expend fuel when leaving the space, or do the other usual things associated with landing; instead, they continue their turn, rolling the dice and moving again from the bypassed space. Lasers can be fired when bypassing.

In &quot;Strategic Solarquest&quot;, the players&#x27; mobility is diminished because most Red Shift cards cause the player to jump around the board to a different location. This can be good or bad – good, if the player is trying to continue orbiting a planet, buying up properties; bad, if the player ends up paying high rents because they are stuck in orbit around a planet whose moons are mostly owned by another player.

=== Comparison with &quot;Monopoly&quot; ===
&quot;Solarquest&quot; is a relatively complex game, with 48 properties available for purchase (compared to &quot;Monopoly&quot;&#x27;s 28), and the additional considerations of fuel and lasers. The player&#x27;s path is not as linear as in &quot;Monopoly&quot;, since it is possible to continue travelling around a planet for several orbits before finally escaping its gravity. Still, the basic concepts are the same, and experience shows it is easy to learn for anyone who has played &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

Like &quot;Monopoly&quot;, this game can theoretically go on indefinitely as cash accumulates and it becomes difficult to force bankruptcy.

== History ==

=== 1985 and 1987 editions ===

&quot;SolarQuest&quot; was first published by Valen Brost Game Company in 1985, and then by Golden/Western Publishing Company in 1987 with minor rule revisions. For instance, in the 1985 edition, refueling on earth cost $25 per hydron; the 1987 rules provided, &quot;If you land on Earth you may also refuel for free as a welcome home gift from the Federation.&quot; Another example is that the 1985 rules allowed the player to collect $500 for passing on Earth and $1,000 for landing on Earth; the 1987 rules provided that &quot;Every time you land on or pass Earth you collect $500 Federons from the bank.&quot;

=== Major competition ===

In 1994, the game and puzzle division of Western Publishing was purchased by Hasbro (parent company of Parker Brothers, the makers of &quot;Monopoly&quot;) who were then controlling 80% of the U.S. board game market, and they chose to market a &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Monopoly&quot; edition instead of &quot;SolarQuest&quot;. The &quot;Monopoly&quot; brand was thus strengthened, while &quot;SolarQuest&quot; was effectively blocked from the board game market.

=== &quot;Apollo 13&quot; edition ===

In 1995, Universal Games released an &quot;Apollo 13&quot; edition featuring artwork from the 1995 Universal Pictures film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Some differences between the 1995 edition and earlier versions include:
* A slightly smaller playing board that now folds into a square instead of into a rectangle.
* New red shift cards allowing three free laser bursts at any player on the board.
* Elimination of refueling on an unowned planet that has been sold back to the Federation with a fuel station on it; under the new rules, a player cannot refuel unless they purchase the property from the Federation for the deed price plus $500 for the fuel station placed by the previous owner.
* Six more moons to buy around Neptune.
* Increased purchase costs for most moons.
* For several planets, a reduction in rent when many moons are owned (for example, rent on Ganymede if a player has eleven moons of Jupiter is $4,630, instead of $7,400).
* At several Federation Stations, an increase in the amount of Federons that players collect (for example, $800 instead of $200 at Federation Station II).
* Red shifts occur only when the player rolls a three and a one on the dice.

=== &quot;Spaceopoly&quot; ===

A highly simplified spinoff was published in 1997 by Valen Brost Game Co called &quot;Spaceopoly&quot;. A bit like &quot;Monopoly&quot;, players travel round the board (representing the solar system) trying to build monopolies, whilst avoiding the perils of space travel. It has secret mission cards, similar to &quot;Risk&quot;, specifying an assignment that the player can complete to win the game. The rules contain quirky provisions; for example, the last sentence of the rule on laser battles reads: &quot;If an opponent fires a laser at your ship and rolls 12 (i.e., double sixes), your ship is totally disabled and you are out of the game. Your attacker wins all of your money and property. Exception: If you hold the &#x27;Invented a new force field&#x27; mission card you survive the attack and automatically win the game!&quot;

=== Computerized versions ===

No computerized versions have been authorized for development by Valen Brost.

==Reception==
In the August 1997 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 238), Rick Swan reviewed the 1997 re-release and noted, despite its similarities to &quot;Monopoly&quot;, that &quot;the rules are surprisingly sophisticated.&quot; Swan also liked the high production values of the components, calling the overall effect &quot;lavish&quot;.

<text>Jaws 3-D (titled Jaws III in its 2-D form) is a 1983 American horror film directed by Joe Alves and starring Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale and Louis Gossett Jr. As the second sequel to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; it was the third installment in the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise. The film follows the Brody children from the previous films to SeaWorld, a Florida marine park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young great white shark infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park&#x27;s employees. Once the shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a second, much larger shark also entered the park and was the real culprit.

The film made use of 3D during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; and &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot;. Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard polarized 3D glasses to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen. Several shots and sequences were designed to utilize the effect, such as the shark&#x27;s destruction. Since 3D was ineffective in home viewing until the advent of 3D televisions in the late 2000s, the alternative title &quot;Jaws III&quot; is used for television broadcasts and home media.

To a lesser degree than its predecessors, &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; was still commercially successful despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. It was followed by &quot;&quot; in 1987, which retroactively ignores this film. 

==Plot==

Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Brody, son of police chief Martin Brody of Amity Island, is working as chief engineer at SeaWorld Orlando alongside his girlfriend, Kathryn &quot;Kay&quot; Morgan, the park&#x27;s senior biologist. Among the attractions are new underwater tunnels that allow for a view of the undersea life.

While the park&#x27;s lagoon gates are stuck open, a great white shark follows an unsuspecting team of water skiers into the park. Kay and her assistants notice that the resident dolphins, especially two individuals Cindy and Sandy, are afraid of leaving their pen and going out into the lagoon. Later, Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, welcomes his friend, adventurer and hunter Philip FitzRoyce, and Mike&#x27;s younger brother Sean arrives for a visit having taken the summer off from college. That night, Shelby Overman, a mechanic, dives into the water to repair and secure the gates. He is attacked by the shark and killed, severing his right arm. Mike, Kay and Sean go out for drinks and Sean meets and begins dating Kelly Ann Bukowski, one of the park&#x27;s water skiers. Meanwhile, two criminals sneak into the park and go underwater to steal coral they intend to sell, but both are killed by the shark in the process.

The next day, Kay and Mike are informed of Overman&#x27;s disappearance. They go down in a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a juvenile great white, only long. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. They inform Bouchard, and FitzRoyce suggests killing the shark on network television. Kay protests, instead recommending capturing the shark and keeping it alive in captivity, which would generate more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured, and Kay and her staff begin to nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies. Kelly persuades Sean out onto the water in a bumper boat, despite his trepidation due to his experiences in Amity.

Overman&#x27;s corpse is discovered and, reviewing the body, Kay realizes that the shark that killed him is the first shark&#x27;s long mother and that it must also be inside the park. She is able to convince Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater café. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injuring Kelly, and causing a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack Tate, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap to kill it. As Jack closes the pipe&#x27;s gate, FitzRoyce successfully leads the shark into the pipe, but his tether rope suddenly snaps due to the strong current generated by its pumps. Trapped inside the pipe and unable to reach the ladder to the exit hatch, he decides to kill the shark with a bang stick to no effect.

The shark proceeds to eat him whole before he can pull the pin from his grenade and kills him. Hearing that the shark has been lured into the pipe, Mike and Kay go down to repair the underwater tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pumps to be shut down to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows it to break free from the pipe and attack Mike and Kay, but they are again saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room and the civilians in the underwater tunnel are safely evacuated. The shark suddenly appears in front of the window and smashes through the glass, flooding the control room and killing a technician.

When the shark&#x27;s mouth is open, Mike notices FitzRoyce&#x27;s corpse which has drifted there from inside its belly still holding the grenade. Mike uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade&#x27;s explosion and killing the shark while he and Kay take cover. Afterwards, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their battle with the shark.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
David Brown and Richard Zanuck, the producers for the first two films, originally pitched the second &quot;Jaws&quot; sequel as a spoof named &quot;Jaws 3, People 0&quot;. In 1979, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the film would be produced by Matty Simmons, fresh off the success of &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, with Zanuck and Brown serving as executive producers. Simmons outlined a story and commissioned &quot;National Lampoon&quot; writers John Hughes and Todd Carroll for a script. Joe Dante was briefly pursued as a director. The projected was also to star Bo Derek and Richard Dreyfuss. The project was shut down as Steven Spielberg, who directed the first film, managed to convince Universal to not make the film by threatening to never work with the studio again. However, industry magazines also reported that the project failed because Zanuck and Brown wanted to produce a PG rated film, while Universal wished to include material which would have &#x27;destined&#x27; the film to be rated R. According to Simmons, Zanuck and Brown preferred the original script, while Simmons also had other creative differences with Universal. David Brown later said that the studio attitude was that a spoof would have been a mistake and that it would be like &quot;fouling in your own nest,&quot; although he himself felt that the project would have been successful.

Alan Landsburg bought the rights to produce the film. He attempted to involve experimental filmmaker Murray Lerner in &quot;Jaws 3&quot;, telling him that people at the Marineland theme park in Florida had seen his 1978 3D film &quot;.&quot; Lerner said that his &quot;heart sank&quot; when he was sent the first script of &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t really get involved in this&quot;. As the production already had an art director, Lerner, who didn&#x27;t like the script, declined to be involved in the film.

The film was directed by Joe Alves, who was the production designer for the first two films and was the second unit director for &quot;Jaws 2&quot;. It had been suggested that Alves co-direct the first sequel with Verna Fields when first director John D. Hancock left the project. It was filmed at SeaWorld Orlando, a marine zoological park; and Navarre, Florida, a community in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola.

As with the first two films in the series, many people were involved in writing the film. Richard Matheson, who had written the script for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1971 television film &quot;Duel&quot;, says that he wrote a &quot;very interesting&quot; outline, although the story is credited to &quot;some other writer&quot;. Universal forced Matheson to include Brody&#x27;s two sons, which the writer &quot;thought was dumb&quot;. They also wanted it to be the same shark that was electrocuted in &quot;Jaws 2&quot;. Matheson was also requested to write a role specifically for Mickey Rooney, saying that &quot;when Mickey Rooney turned out not to be available, the whole part was pointless&quot;. The writer was unhappy with the finished film.

I&#x27;m a good storyteller and I wrote a good outline and a good script. And if they had done it right and if it had been directed by somebody who knew how to direct, I think it would have been an excellent movie. &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; was the only thing Joe Alves ever directed; the man is a very skilled production designer, but as a director, no. And the so-called 3D just made the film look murky – it had no effect whatsoever. It was a waste of time.

Guerdon Trueblood is credited for the story; a reviewer for the website SciFilm says that the screenplay was based upon Trueblood&#x27;s story about a white shark swimming upstream and becoming trapped in a lake. Carl Gottlieb, who had also revised the screenplays for the first two &quot;Jaws&quot; films, was credited for the script alongside Richard Matheson. Matheson has reported in interviews that the screenplay was revised by script doctors. Alves said in an interview in June 2020 that approximately 20 minutes of footage were cut from the final film due to Landsburg&#x27;s insistence.

The character of Calvin Bouchard (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) was originally intended to be the shark&#x27;s final victim though the producers enjoyed his performance so much the script was rewritten for him to survive.

===Casting===
The film did not use any actors from the first two &quot;Jaws&quot; films. Roy Scheider, who played Police Chief Martin Brody in the first two films, laughed at the thought of &quot;Jaws 3&quot;, saying that &quot;Mephistopheles ... couldn&#x27;t talk me into doing [it] ... They knew better than to even ask&quot;. He agreed to do the film &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; to ensure his unavailability for &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;.

Dennis Quaid stated in a 2015 interview that, of all his films, he made the most aggressive use of cocaine during the filming of &quot;Jaws 3D&quot;, and that he was high on the drug in &quot;every frame&quot; in which he appears.

There was a revival in popularity of 3D at this time, with many films using the technique. &quot;Jaws&quot; second sequel integrated the technology into its title, as did &quot;Amityville 3D&quot;. &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; could also make dual use of the number three. The gimmick was also advertised in the tagline &quot;the third dimension is terror.&quot; As it was Joe Alves&#x27; first film as director, he thought that 3D would &quot;give him an edge&quot;.
Cinema audiences could wear disposable polarized glasses to view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying to the forefront of the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the blue screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.

&quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; had two 3D consultants: the production started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later added to the team for the ArriVision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after a week for the ArriVision system, &quot;which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses&quot;. According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that &quot;the left and right images [in &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it&#x27;s restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache.&quot; Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. The cameras were used in conjunction, a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film. The Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35 mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half, a technique known as &quot;over/under&quot;. This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarized 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation ⁠— something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective &quot;silver&quot; screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18 mm over/under 3D lens.

This kind of 3D effect does not work on television without special electronic hardware at the viewer&#x27;s end, and so with two exceptions, the home video and broadcast TV versions of &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; were created using just the left-eye image, and with the title changed to &quot;Jaws 3&quot; or &quot;Jaws III&quot;. Because the left-eye image only takes up half the 35 mm film frame, the picture resolution is noticeably poorer than would normally be expected of a film shot on 35 mm.

One of the exceptions was a 1986 release of the film for the now-obsolete Video High Density (VHD) video disc system. This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer&#x27;s eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarized 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; released in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.

On June 14, 2016 Universal released a Blu-ray edition of the film. Though advertised as a 2-D release, a complete Blu-ray 3D version is included as a special feature.

==Music==

===Soundtrack===

The score was composed and conducted by Alan Parker, who had previously provided music for British television shows including &quot;Van der Valk&quot; and &quot;Minder&quot;. It was Parker&#x27;s first feature score, but he would later work on &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; and &quot;American Gothic.&quot; John Williams&#x27; original shark motif is, however, integrated into the score. The soundtrack album was released by MCA Records which was absorbed by Geffen Records. The soundtrack was later released on CD by Intrada and was limited to only 3000 copies.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The film was heavily promoted before its wide release across the U.S. As with &quot;Jaws 2,&quot; Topps produced a series of trading cards. Television stations were encouraged to broadcast the featurette, &quot;Making of Jaws 3-D: Sharks Don&#x27;t Die,&quot; in a prime-time slot between July 16 and 22, 1983 to take advantage of an advertisement in that week&#x27;s issue of &quot;TV Guide.&quot; Alan Landsburg Productions found itself in trouble for using 90 seconds of footage from the National Geographic 1983 documentary film &quot;The Sharks&quot; in the featurette without authorization.

===Box office===
The film grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend, which was 1983&#x27;s second highest-grossing opening weekend of the year, playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release and accounting for 29.5% of its final gross. It has achieved total lifetime worldwide gross of $88 million. Despite being No. 1 at the box office, this illustrates the series&#x27; diminishing returns, since &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; has earned nearly $100 million less than the total lifetime gross of its predecessor and $300 million less than the original film. The final sequel would attract an even lower income, with around two thirds of &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;&#x27;s total lifetime gross. After its opening weekend the film&#x27;s box office grosses declined sharply by over 40% during later weeks, although it was still drawing huge audiences when it was pulled from theaters; film historian R.M. Hayes says this action &quot;was pure nonsense considering some cinemas were actually turning over more money per screen than the latest &quot;Star Wars&quot; film&quot;.

===Critical reception===
While &quot;Jaws 2&quot; had received mixed, differentiated reviews and is regarded as the best of the Jaws sequels, reception for Jaws 3-D was generally negative. &quot;Variety&quot; calls it &quot;tepid&quot; and suggests that Alves &quot;fails to linger long enough on the Great White.&quot; It has an 11% &#x27;rotten&#x27; rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;A cheese-soaked ocean thriller with no evident reason to exist, &quot;Jaws 3&quot; bellows forth with a plaintive yet ultimately unheeded cry to put this franchise out of viewers&#x27; misery.&quot; Metacritic, using a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 27 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. The 3D was criticized as being a gimmick to attract audiences to the aging series and for being ineffective. Roger Ebert heavily criticized the film on &quot;At the Movies&quot;, particularly a scene where the shark follows some waterskiing performers which he found unrealistic while his colleague Gene Siskel criticized the 3D finding the scene where the shark breaks the aquarium glass the worst effect of the film. Both named it one of the worst sequels of the year. Allrovi, however, says that &quot;the suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film&#x27;s original release with 3D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel.&quot; Derek Winnert says that &quot;with Richard Matheson&#x27;s name on the script you&#x27;d expect a better yarn&quot; although he continues to say that the film &quot;is entirely watchable with a big pack of popcorn.&quot; Others are disappointed that Matheson and Gottlieb produced this script given their previous success. Later reviews expressed astonishment &quot;that a sequel this downright abominable didn&#x27;t kill the franchise, but that it actually would be followed by a movie that was arguably worse—&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Amongst the flaws, a BBC critic described the film as &quot;still marginally entertaining.&quot; The sound design has been commended, however. The moment when an infant&#x27;s cry is heard when the baby shark dies in the pool is particularly praised by one reviewer. Gossett said he was the &quot;only cast member to survive the generally negative reviews&quot;.

In her screenwriting textbook, Linda Aronson suggests that its protagonist, played by Quaid, is a major problem with the film. She says that after taking too long for him to be introduced, the character is &quot;essentially a passive onlooker.&quot; There is no hunt until the climax when the shark is terrorizing the people in the aquarium; only then does Mike Brody become centre of the action. She also highlights inaccuracies in the plot. For instance, she refutes the idea of a &quot;mother shark protecting her offspring [as] sharks do not mother their young,&quot; and points out that dolphins can attack sharks.

Leonard Maltin calls the film a &quot;road-company Irwin Allen type-disaster film&quot; and notes that its premise is similar to the 1955 sequel to &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;.

&quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; was nominated for five 1983 Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Lou Gossett Jr.), Screenplay, and Newcomer (Cindy and Sandy, &quot;The Shrieking Dolphins&quot;), but received none.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
The film was released in a standard 2-D format on DVD by Universal on June 3, 2003 under the title &quot;Jaws 3&quot;. With the exception of one theatrical trailer, no bonus features were included.

Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the &quot;Jaws&quot; series of films in HD on Blu-ray in 2016, including, &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; on Blu-ray 3D. Universal releases &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 23, 2024, alongside &quot;Jaws: The Revenge&quot;.

<text>The Artognou stone, sometimes erroneously referred to as the Arthur stone, is an archaeological artefact uncovered in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. It was discovered in 1998 in securely dated sixth-century contexts among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, a secular, high status settlement of sub-Roman Britain. It appears to have originally been a practice dedication stone for some building or other public structure, but it was broken in two and re-used as part of a drain when the original structure was destroyed. Upon its discovery the stone achieved some notoriety due to the suggestion that &quot;Artognou&quot; was connected to the legendary King Arthur, though scholars such as John Koch have criticised the evidence for this connection. The stone is on display at the Royal Cornwall Museum.

==Archaeological description==

The dating of the stone has been arrived at by two methods: first, the stone came from a securely stratified context in association with imported pottery of known types dating to the fifth/sixth centuries; second, forms of certain letters noted on the slate appear in British inscribed stones from Scotland to Cornwall post-500 and are certainly known elsewhere from 6th century north Cornwall (part of the kingdom of Dumnonia).

At the top right-hand corner of the fragment is a deeply cut motif consisting (as visible) of a letter A and another incomplete character on either side of a large diagonal cross; the whole may represent a common Christian symbol, a Christogram—the Greek alphabet letters Alpha and Omega flanking a large Greek letter Chi (written like a Roman X), the initial of &quot;Christos&quot; (Christ). Below this and to the left, but overlapping it slightly, is a smaller, more lightly incised inscription in Latin, reading: . This seems to have been repeated lower down and to the right; only the letters and , on two lines, can be seen on the fragment. This repetition, the overlap with the Christogram and the shallow carving (scratching would be a more accurate description) all suggest that this was not a formal inscription but an example of graffiti.

The inscription has been translated by the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project as &quot;Artognou descendant of Patern[us] Colus made (this). Colus made (this).&quot;

The name Artognou means &quot;Bear Knowing&quot;, from the Brittonic root *&quot;arto&quot; &quot;bear&quot; plus *&quot;gnāwo-&quot; &quot;to know&quot;, and is cognate with the Old Breton name Arthnou and Welsh Arthneu.

Also found in the sixth-century fort at Tintagel were numerous remains of expensive pottery, glasswork, and coins from Visigothic Spain and the Byzantine Empire (when excavated in the 1930s by C. A. Ralegh Radford).

==Arthurian controversy==
After its discovery the stone was advanced in popular news media as possible evidence for the historical basis for the legendary King Arthur, with the name &quot;Artognou&quot; proposed as a variant of &quot;Arthur&quot;, and was referred to as the &quot;Arthur stone&quot;. The stone&#x27;s dating fits the general timeframe usually given for an &quot;historical Arthur&quot; and, according to a tradition first recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Arthur was conceived at Tintagel Castle. However, the Celticist John Koch and other scholars have rejected this idea, arguing against the connection between the names and saying there is no reason to suspect an association with an historical Arthur. Koch justifies this by pointing out that the name &quot;Artognou&quot; means &quot;bear-knowledge&quot;, whereas he suggests the name &quot;Arthur&quot; is more likely derived from the Latin &quot;Artorius&quot;.

*Glasgow University: Tintagel Excavations 1998. The archaeological context of the find: &quot;Although Tintagel is often associated with the mysterious and mythical past, we must dismiss any idea that the name on this stone is in any way to be associated with the legendary and literary figure Arthur. Arthur was only associated with Tintagel through the work of Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth century, six hundred years later. As Professor Thomas states, &quot;All this stone shows in the name ARTOGNOU, is the use of this (Celtic) element&quot;.

<text>Tenali Ramakrishna (born Garlapati Ramakrishna; also known as Tenali Ramalinga and Tenali Rama; 22 September 1480 – 5 August 1528) was a Telugu poet, scholar, and advisor in the court of Sri Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire. Hailing from Tenali, he earned acclaim as one of the Ashtadiggajas, a group of eight celebrated Telugu poets in Sri Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s court, and is best known for his sharp wit and humour. His literary contributions include the notable work &quot;Panduranga Mahatmyam&quot;, which is regarded as one of the five great Telugu Kāvyas. He is often referred to by the title &quot;Vikatakavi,&quot; meaning &quot;jester poet,&quot; reflecting his unique ability to blend humour with wisdom. Tenali Ramakrishna&#x27;s legacy continues to inspire various cultural adaptations in literature and media.

== Early life ==
Tenali Ramakrishna was born in a Telugu-speaking Viswa Brahmin family in the village of Tenali in the Vijayanagara Empire. His father, Garlapati Ramayya, was a priest at the Ramalingeswara Swami Temple in Santharavuru. After the death of his father during Ramakrishna&#x27;s childhood, his mother Lakshmamma took him to Vijayanagara. 

Despite not receiving formal education, Ramakrishna&#x27;s thirst for knowledge led him to become a renowned scholar. As per popular legend, after being rejected by Vaishnava scholars for being a Shaiva, he wandered aimlessly until he met a sage who advised him to worship the Goddess Kali. According to the tale, Kali blessed him for his devotion and wit, predicting he would achieve greatness as a poet.

== Vijayanagara court ==
Tenali Ramakrishna was appointed as an advisor and poet in the court of King Krishnadevaraya. He earned the title &quot;Vikatakavi&quot; (jester poet) due to his sharp wit and humour. He was one of the Ashtadiggajas, a group of eight celebrated poets in the Vijayanagara court, and became an important figure in Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s administration, assisting the king in various matters. He was very close to the royal family and Prime Minister Timmarusu.

== Literary works ==
Tenali Ramakrishna&#x27;s most significant literary contribution is &quot;Panduranga Mahatmyam&quot;, considered one of the five great Telugu &quot;Kāvyas&quot;. This work narrates the legend of Panduranga, an incarnation of Vishnu, and focuses on devotion and the afterlife. Additionally, he composed &quot;Udbhataradhya Charitamu&quot;, a narrative poem about the Shaiva teacher Udbhata, influenced by the work of Palakuriki Somanatha&#x27;s &quot;Basava Puranam&quot;. Through his works, Ramakrishna demonstrated his deep connection to Shaivism while gaining recognition for his literary prowess.

== Later years and death ==
Tenali Ramakrishna is believed to have died in 1528 due to a snakebite, a year before the death of Krishnadevaraya. Although historical records of his final years are scarce, he is said to have played a significant role in assisting Krishnadevaraya in state matters and was regarded as the king&#x27;s close friend.

== In popular culture ==
Tenali Ramakrishna&#x27;s life and wit have inspired numerous cultural works:
* The 1956 Telugu film &quot;Tenali Ramakrishna&quot;, starring A. Nageswara Rao
* The 1956 Tamil film &quot;Tenali Raman&quot;, starring Sivaji Ganesan
* The 1982 Kannada film &quot;Hasyaratna Ramakrishna&quot;, starring Anant Nag
* The 1990 Hindi television series &quot;Tenali Rama&quot; aired on Doordarshan
* The 2003 animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tenali Raman&quot; was produced by Cartoon Network
* The Sony SAB series &quot;Tenali Rama&quot; (2017–2020 , 2024 - ongoing) is also based on his legendary tales.
* Tenali Ramakrishna&#x27;s character appears in various Telugu, Tamil, and Kannada films and series.

<text>City Mill River is part of the Bow Back Rivers in London, England. It formerly fed City Mill, used for the production of chemicals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the 1930s, the mill was removed and the river was isolated from the tides by the construction of locks at both ends. City Mill Lock, at the southern end, has been refurbished and reopened in 2010.

==History==
City Mill River leaves the old channel of the River Lea at its northern end, and flows in a south-easterly direction, originally to City Mill. Town plans from 1895 and 1923 both indicate that it was used for the production of chemicals. The mill straddled the channel, and a bypass stream flowed to the west of the present course, to meet the Waterworks River below the mill. The discharge from the mill was into a large pool, which also formed a part of the Waterworks River. By the late 1920s, most of the Bow Back Rivers including the City Mill River were in serious decay, and the Lee Conservancy Board, jointly with West Ham Corporation, obtained a government grant as part of an unemployment relief scheme to carry out a number of improvements to the rivers. The work was authorised by the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act of 1930, and work began in 1931, taking four years to complete.

The course of the river was largely unchanged by the improvements, except at the southern end, where the mill was demolished, and the channel was routed through the mill site. Part of the mill basin was filled in, and the river joined Bow Back River, which was moved slightly further to the north, away from Bow Road and Stratford High Street. The Waterworks River, to the east of the mill basin, was widened and routed further to the west, and a connecting lock was built between the new course of the City Mill River and the new course of the Waterworks River. The river ceased to be tidal, as City Mills Lock isolated the southern end from the tidal Waterworks River, and Carpenter&#x27;s Lock isolated the northern end, allowing the river to be maintained at the same level as Limehouse Cut. It became semi-tidal, since the water level in Limehouse Cut was maintained by Bow Locks, but high tides overtopped the gates, resulting in there being fluctuations at spring tides.
==City Mill Lock==

City Mill Lock, which connects Bow Back River and the bottom of the City Mill River to the Waterworks River, was built as part of the 1930s improvement programme. Unlike Carpenter&#x27;s Lock, which was built at the same time and was fitted with vertical radial gates, City Mill Lock was built with conventional mitre gates. Two pairs of gates pointing to the west, allowing the lock to be used when the level of the water in the Waterworks River was lower than that in the City Mill River, and a third pair pointing to the east, which prevented high tide levels in the Waterworks River forcing the gates open, and the City Mill River draining as the tide fell. The lock was wide, and could handle boats up to long. The original gates lasted for almost seventy years, but by 2000 were deemed to be unsafe, and were replaced by stop planks.

In 2005, the lock was partially restored as part of the planning gain required from the developers of the adjacent Bellamy Homes housing scheme. Three sets of new steel gates, manufactured in Sheffield by Mandall Engineering, were installed at a cost of £200,000, and a further £100,000 was spent on general improvements to the area and the access paths to the lock. This left the lock in good condition, but not operational, since the gates did not have balance beams, and the hydraulic operating mechanism was not included in the work. Funding for the provision of the equipment came from the development of the area for the 2012 Olympic Games. Another £200,000 wes spent on the hydraulic rams, sluices, and the associated controls, and on lock ladders and landing stages to enable the lock to be used safely by boaters. The work was completed in 2010, and the lock was formally opened on 31 July.

The work involved dealing with large amounts of plant growth, particularly water pennywort, &quot;Hydrocotyle ranunculoides&quot;, a member of the apiaceae, which were treated with herbicides to remove them. Water pennywort is a non-native invasive species, which quickly forms a dense mat of vegetation on the surface of slow-moving water, preventing the growth of other species and the movement of animals and boats.

<text>Selwyn District is a predominantly rural district in central Canterbury, on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is named after the Selwyn River / Waikirikiri, which is in turn named after Bishop George Selwyn, the first Anglican bishop of New Zealand who, in 1843 and 1844, travelled the length of the country by horse, foot, boat and canoe, leaving in his wake a sprinkling of locations that now bear his name.

As of the 2023 census, Selwyn District is the fastest-growing territorial authority in New Zealand, with a population increase of 29% over the prior five years.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of the area were the Māori who first settled New Zealand from the Cook and Society Islands about 700 years ago. The predominant Māori tribe today, in Selwyn and most of the rest of the South Island, is Ngāi Tahu, whose local marae (meeting house) is at Taumutu near the exit of Lake Ellesmere (Te Waihora).

In the late 19th century, European (chiefly British) colonists arrived and carved the area up into farmland. This has remained the predominant pattern ever since.

The Selwyn District as a unit of government was formed in the 1989 local government reforms from a legislated merger of the Malvern and Ellesmere counties, along with a portion of Paparua County.

Since this time, the district has enjoyed a stable and prosperous existence. Recent years have seen above-average population growth, making it the fastest-growing local authority in New Zealand in 2013.

Most of Selwyn&#x27;s new residents have moved from Christchurch to settle on small &quot;lifestyle&quot; farms and in Selwyn&#x27;s small towns which are within easy commuting distance of the city (e.g. Rolleston, Prebbleton, Lincoln, West Melton, Kirwee). Rolleston is the largest town in Selwyn.

Selwyn District, along with Christchurch and Waimakariri District, experienced some damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. The earthquake epicentre was located just outside Darfield.

== Government ==
The district is governed by an elected mayor and a council of 11 members, elected simultaneously every 3 years. The current mayor is Sam Broughton, who was first elected mayor in October 2016.

The mayor is elected on a First Past the Post basis.

The 10 councillors are elected from four wards on a multi-member First Past the Post basis; the total number of votes a candidate receives are considered:

a.) 2 councillors are elected from Ellesmere Wardb.) 2 councillors are elected from Malvern Wardc.) 3 councillors are elected from Rolleston Wardd.) 3 councillors are elected from Springs Ward

The Malvern Ward also has a Community Board, which has power delegated to it by the Council.

The Selwyn district is within the Canterbury Region so Canterbury Regional Council has responsibilities for regional planning, and water, air, discharge and river bed resource consents.

The Selwyn district has powers delegated to it by the Government of New Zealand, and carries out its duties regarding laws such as the Local Government Act 2002 and the Resource Management Act 1991.

In national politics, Selwyn is represented in the Selwyn electorate. Nicola Grigg of the National Party is the incumbent MP.

== Geography ==
The Selwyn District lies in central Canterbury, and occupies a central position in the South Island.

Boundaries: On the Canterbury Plains, the Waimakariri River forms the northern boundary; in the hill country the border with the Hurunui District is more arbitrary. The eastern boundary comprises (from north to south) the city of Christchurch, Banks Peninsula, and the South Pacific Ocean. The southern boundary is the Rakaia River, beyond which lies Ashburton District. The western boundary is the main divide of the Southern Alps.

Geographical features: Selwyn District contains within it two distinct regions: the plains and the high country. The plains, where most of the population lives and the majority of activity takes place, form an expanse of low-lying, flat, and comparatively dry grassland. The extreme south-east is dominated by Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, an expanse of water surrounded by marshes, formed by the out-flow of the Selwyn River / Waikirikiri. The tributaries of the Selwyn River include the Waianiwaniwa River, the Hororata River and the Hawkins River.

The high country is a sparsely-populated region, mainly consisting of hill and mountain ranges and narrow river valleys. Most of the high country is grassland, including some tussocklands; areas of beech forest remain within the Craigieburn Forest Park and the Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park.

Climate: The plains have a temperate climate, characterised by warm, dry summers and cool winters. The Southern Alps are responsible for the relatively low rainfall, and also lead to a foehn wind, the &quot;Canterbury Nor&#x27;Wester&quot;. This strong, hot and dry wind is most common in spring and summer, and on occasion reaches damage-causing strength. In the mountain country of the Southern Alps, conditions are much colder and wetter.

Some horsebreeding is also done. There is also a substantial amount of cropping; wheat and barley are grown on the plains, along with smaller amounts of grapes and other fruit, vegetables, mushrooms and flowers.

Selwyn District experienced the strongest economic growth of any district in New Zealand in 2012, with employment growing by 9.5%, compared to the national average of 1%. 1,200 new jobs were created in the district in 2012.

<doc id="1173377" wikidata="Q5278576" url="?curid=1173377" title="Srinatha">
<text>Srinatha ( – 1441) was a well-known 15th-century Telugu poet who popularised the Prabandha style of composition.

==Biography==
Srinatha was born in a Telugu Brahmin family of Bharadwaja gotra in Kalapatam village on Gudur Mandal in Krishna district to parents and in 1355/1360. His grandfather was who allegedly wrote a Telugu translation of Padma Purana.

Srinatha was respected as (King among poets) in Telugu, and patronised by many kings. Srinatha worked as a minister in the court of Pedakomati Vema Reddy of Kondaveedu. He managed to get his king&#x27;s prestigious knife which was taken away by Lingamanedu ruler of Devarakanda in return for his literary prowess. Srinatha produced and dedicated a host of books to kings and enjoyed a luxurious life. However, he seemed to have suffered from poverty at the end of his life. Srinatha died in 1441, after the conquest of Coastal Andhra by Kapileswara Gajapati.

He was not the brother-in-law of another famous Telugu poet Potana as shown in the Telugu movies.

==Works==
Srinatha wrote &quot;Sivaratri Mahatyam&quot;, &quot;Haravilāsamu&quot;, &quot;Bhimakhandam&quot;, &quot;Kasikhandamu&quot;, &quot;Srungara Naishadham&quot;, &quot;Palanati Veeracharitra&quot;, &quot;Dhananjaya Vijjayam&quot;, Marrutaratcharithra, &quot;Srungaradipika&quot; and &quot;Kridabhiramam&quot; over the subjects of history and mythology. He translated &quot;Salivahana Gatha Saptasati&quot; in to Telugu from Prakrit.

==Style==
&quot;Prabandha&quot; can be described as a story in verse form with a tight metrical structure. Srinatha&#x27;s &quot;Srungara Naishadhamu&quot; is a well-known example of the form.

He is also credited with hundreds of extempore poems called Chatuvulu in Telugu.

Moreover, Srinath was considered popular for his composition of the Seesa Meter in his books, where most part of his eloquent poetry is written in. 

==Awards and Titles==
He was widely regarded as the &quot;Kavi&quot; &quot;Sarvabhouma&quot; (The emperor among poets). He had broken the drum of Gouda Dimdimabhattu in the court of Vijayanagara during the reign of Proudhadevarayulu, by his incredible skill of conversing. He was honoured with gold for his dexterity in the Telugu literature by the king. 

==In popular culture==
A biographical film on Srinatha named &quot;Srinatha Kavi&quot; directed by Bapu was released in 1993 starring veteran actor N. T. Rama Rao, also popularly called Nata Sarvabhoumudu, and Jayasudha.

Srinatha is a prominent character in the Telugu film &quot;Bhakta Potana&quot; produced by the Vauhini Studios in 1942. In the fim thespian V. Nagayya played the role of Bammera Potana, and Gowrinatha Sastry played the role of Srinatha as the brother-in-law of Potana.

It is situated at the eastern end of the lake, on the narrow shore between Montreux and Villeneuve, which gives access to the Alpine valley of the Rhône. Chillon is amongst the most visited medieval castles in Switzerland and Europe. Successively occupied by the House of Savoy, then by the Bernese from 1536 until 1798, it now belongs to the canton de Vaud and is classified as a Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance. 

== Etymology ==
According to the Swiss ethnologist Albert Samuel Gatschet, the name &quot;Chillon&quot; derives from the Waldensian dialect and means &quot;flat stone, slab, platform&quot;. The name &quot;Castrum Quilonis&quot;, attested from 1195, would, therefore, mean &quot;castle built on a rock platform.

== Introduction ==
The castle of Chillon is built on the island of Chillon, an oval limestone rock advancing in Lake Geneva between Montreux and Villeneuve with a steep side on one side and on the other side the lake and its steep bottom. The placement of the castle is strategic: it guards the passage between the , which allows access to the north towards Germany and France, and the Rhone valley, a quick route to Italy, and offers a viewpoint over the Savoyard coast on the opposite side of the lake. A garrison could thus control (both militarily and commercially) access to the road to Italy and apply a toll.
Chillon has been a military site since the central Middle Ages and the development of the current castle spans three periods: the Savoy Period, the Bernese Period, and the Vaudois Period.

==History==
===Savoy period===
A square donjon was built on the island in the 11th century, the identity of the works&#x27; commissioner is currently in question. It was built to control the road from Burgundy to the Great Saint Bernard Pass. A charter of 1150, in which Count Humbert III granted the Cistercians of Hautcrêt free passage to Chillon, shows that the castle was under the authority of the House of Savoy.

From the mid 12th century, the castle was summer home to the Counts of Savoy, who kept a fleet of ships on Lake Geneva. The castle was greatly expanded in 1248 and 1266-7 by Count Peter II. During this time the distinctive windows were added by Master James of Saint George, who is believed also to have added similar windows to Harlech Castle in Wales at a later date.

===Chillon as a prison===
The counts and dukes of Savoy used the castle as a residence but also to house prisoners. Its most famous prisoner was probably François de Bonivard, a Genevois monk, prior of St. Victor in Geneva and historian, who was imprisoned there for six years in 1530.

===Bernese period===
In 1536, the castle was captured by a Bernese army, and all the prisoners, including Bonivard, were released. The castle became the residence for the Bernese bailiff.

===Vaudois period===
In 1798, the French-speaking canton of Vaud drove out the German-speaking Bernese authorities and declared the Lemanic Republic. The Vaudois invited in French troops to help them maintain autonomy from the other Swiss. When the French moved in and occupied, Chillon was used as a munitions and weapons depot.

== Restoration ==
At the end of the 19th century, a systematic restoration of the monument was undertaken, through which an ethic of monumental restoration was developed in one of the first cases of the application of archaeology and history to rebuild a structure in a historically accurate way. This was possible because of the combination of four factors:

* The involvement of pioneering specialists in restoration including Johann Rudolf Rahn, one of the founders of the Swiss Society of Historical Monuments in 1880, and , a specialist in Renaissance architecture who was closely associated with the restoration of buildings such as the Romanesque church of in Saint-Sulpice, the in Lausanne, and the Lausanne Cathedral. The initial lead architect of the restoration at Chillon was , who had worked with de Geymüller in restoring Lausanne Cathedral. He initiated a general survey of the fortress, which was continued and intensified by his replacement as lead architect-archaeologist, , who played a major role in the development of archaeology in the Canton of Vaud. Naef devoted twenty years to the study of Chillon. Subordinating aesthetics to historical accuracy, he undertook detailed research into historical archives and conducted extensive archaeological excavations. The process was conscientiously documented in plans, sketches, photographs, and a journal kept by Naef. Until it was abandoned in 1908 the restoration followed a painstaking process of indicating replacement stones with inscriptions on the cut stone (R = Restored; RFS = Restoration facsimile; RL = Free Restoration), or by a change of colour or a red line on the masonry. Naef also restored the interior of the castle, including the tapestries of certain rooms such as the great room of the bailiff, also called the &quot;great Bernese kitchen&quot;.
* The creation in 1887 of The Association for the Restoration of Chillon. From the outset, the Association aimed for an &quot;artistic&quot; restoration with the intention of &quot;giving back to objects the character with which they were clothed, almost a latent life, a life impression of the ideas of their time&quot;. It is also planned to create a historical museum at the castle.
* The appointment in 1889 of a Technical Commission comprising renowned art historians and architects who specialised in monument restoration. Alongside Rahn and de Geymüller, it included Théodore Fivel, architect in Chambéry and connoisseur of Savoyard castle architecture, , restorer of the , and State architect Henri Assinare. The Commission first met on 27 October 1890 and closely supervised the restoration over subsequent years. De Geymüller played a key role in its success. Drawing on principles published in 1865, and enhanced in 1888, by the Royal Institute of British Architects, he established a framework in the &quot;Milestones for the Restoration Program&quot; printed in Lausanne in 1896. Naef also joined the Technical Commission on the death of Fivel in 1895.
* The adoption by the Canton of Vaud in 1898 of a law on historic monuments, the first of its kind in Switzerland, which planned to establish a cantonal Commission for historic monuments and to create a cantonal archeologist&#x27;s post. Naef, who drafted the law, was the first appointee to this function and was responsible for putting in place protection of historical monuments.
The result was judged to be exemplary. In an 1898 lecture to the Zurich Antiquity Society, Johann Rudolf Rahn boasted about it, while the German Emperor, William II, inquired about the Chillon model when planning the reconstruction of the fortress of Haut-Koenigsbourg. Due to these restorations, the castle is in excellent condition and is a good model of feudal architecture.

== Tourism ==
From the end of the 18th century, the castle attracted romantic writers and inspired poets from around the world, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Mary Shelley and Lord Byron. By 1939, helped by its proximity to the popular tourist destination Montreux, the castle was attracting over 100,000 visitors a year. By 2005, this number had increased to 300,000.

Chillon remains open to the public for visits and tours on an entrance fee basis and is, according to the castle&#x27;s website, &quot;Switzerland&#x27;s most visited historic monument&quot;. There are parking spaces and a nearby bus stop. Inside the castle are recreations of the interiors of some of the main rooms including the grand bedroom, hall, and cave stores. Visitors can view four great halls, three courtyards, and a series of bedrooms including the &quot;Camera domini&quot;, which was occupied by the Duke of Savoy and is decorated with 14th century murals.

== In art and popular culture ==

Having been inspired by the story of François Bonivard after a visit to the castle, Lord Byron wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot; in 1816 about François. Byron supposedly carved his name on a pillar of the dungeon The French artist Eugène Delacroix drew inspiration from Byron&#x27;s poem for his painting &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot; which was exhibited at the Salon of 1835.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon included a poetical illustration to a painting of the castle by Samuel Prout (engraved by J. B. Allen), in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838.

Gustave Courbet painted the castle several times during his Swiss exile in nearby La Tour-de-Peilz. The most famous representation is &quot;The Castle of Chillon,&quot; oil on canvas painted in 1874 and currently located at the Musée Courbet in Ornans.

In his 1878 novel &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;, Henry James has his heroine and a young American compatriot, Winterbourne, visit Chillon Castle. The one-time prison of François Bonivard assumes a symbolic and premonitory significance for Daisy Miller, who thinks she can escape the shackles of social conventions.

In 1890, watchmaker Edouard- GabrielWuthrich, finished a mechanical automaton that took five years to make. Made of zinc, steel and brass it is a 1/100 scale model illustrating the capture of the castle and liberation of François Bonivard by the Bernese in 1536. Measuring , it is equipped with a music box with original sheet music handwritten by Genevan composer E. Perrin and includes one hundred moving figurines, including many small soldiers and scenes of torture in dungeons visible through barred windows. The automaton disappeared for decades and was eventually purchased by the Association of Friends of Chillon, the Cantonal Museum of Archeology and History (MCAH) and the Castle Foundation, for 59,000 Swiss francs, at an auction held in Paris in March 2016.

The painter E. Lapierre depicted the castle in oil on canvas in 1896.

Chillon was used as the cover image of Bill Evans&#x27; 1968 live album &quot;Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival&quot; and inspired the castle in the 1989 Disney animated film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

Patrick Caulfield&#x27;s painting After Lunch (1975) includes a photomural of Chateau Chillon.

The castle has twice hosted the Compagnie du Graal theatre company, based in Thonon-les-Bains, in 2009 for a sound and light adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear and again in 2012 for the creation of an epic fresco inspired by the titan of Greek mythology, Hyperion.

<doc id="1173384" wikidata="Q45362" url="?curid=1173384" title="Bijou Phillips">
<text>Bijou Lilly Phillips Masterson (born April 1, 1980) is an American model, socialite, former actress and singer. The daughter of musicians John Phillips and Geneviève Waïte, she began her career as a model. Phillips made her singing debut with &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Eat Glass&quot; (1999), and since her first major film appearance in &quot;Black and White&quot; (1999), she has acted in &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), &quot;Bully&quot; (2001), &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004), &quot;Havoc&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2007), and &quot;Choke&quot; (2008). From 2010 to 2013, she played the recurring role of Lucy Carlyle on the television series &quot;Raising Hope&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Phillips was born on April 1, 1980, in Greenwich, Connecticut, and is the daughter of John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas and his third wife, Geneviève Waïte, a South African model, artist, and actress. She was named for the song &quot;My Petite Bijou&quot; by Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross (&quot;bijou&quot; means &#x27;jewel&#x27; in French). She is the youngest of Phillips&#x27;s children; she has one brother, Tamerlane, and three half-siblings (Mackenzie, Jeffrey, and Chynna). After her parents split up, both were found unfit to have custody of Bijou and she was placed in foster care with a family in Bolton Landing, New York. She lived there on and off, making extended visits with her parents, who had both acquired houses in the area. Her father won custody when she was in third grade, and she moved with him to Lloyd Harbor, a village of the Town of Huntington, Long Island.

According to Waïte, when Phillips was 13 years old, her half-sister Mackenzie informed Bijou of her (Mackenzie&#x27;s) ten-year incestuous relationship with their father, and the information had a devastating effect on Bijou&#x27;s teenage years, stripping her of her innocence and leaving her &quot;wary of [her] father&quot;.

At 14, Phillips left school and moved into her own apartment with a housekeeper, just off Fifth Avenue. Once described by &quot;The Observer&quot; as a &quot;wild child&quot;, she experienced a rebellious childhood in New York City, where she used to party, drink and take drugs, such as cocaine, ecstasy, and heroin. On this period of her life, she remarked: &quot;If you were 14 years old and able to live on your own in an apartment in New York City, and you got invited to all these clubs, and you got a bank account and you had a car service you could call so that you could go wherever you wanted ... What would happen?&quot; Growing up, she became something of a local tabloids&#x27; fixture due to her late-night persona and association with other socialites like sisters Paris and Nicky Hilton. She claimed she lost her virginity to rock singer Evan Dando when she was 15 and he was about 27 or 28. At 17, following the death of a friend, the 20-year-old Manhattan socialite Davide Sorrenti, her father sent her into rehab.

==Career==
===Beginnings (1994–1999)===
Phillips was on the cover of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine when she was 13. Shortly thereafter, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;. Phillips also became an image model for Calvin Klein and appeared in several advertising campaigns in which adolescents showed white underwear. The campaigns were widely condemned as eerily pedophilic. She has expressed her distaste for the modeling world, and once stated in an interview: &quot;It was like, I wanted to go swimming in the ocean, but I was jumping up and down in a puddle.&quot;

After signing a record deal at age 17, Phillips began working on her debut album &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Eat Glass&quot;, produced by Jerry Harrison. It was released on May 11, 1999, by Almo Sounds, and remains her only full-length music release to date. The album&#x27;s title refers to her past as a fashion model, saying she would &quot;rather eat glass&quot; than go back to modeling. Phillips collaborated with a number of artists when writing songs for the album, including Eric Bazilian, Greg Wells, Dave Bassett, Howard Jones and Jill Cunniff. Upon its release, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Eat Glass&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, mostly criticising the work for being immature, but her musical style has been positively compared to Natalie Imbruglia or Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo.

Phillips made her film debut in a brief role of the independent drama &quot;Sugar Town&quot; (1999). Her first major film role came the same year, as an Upper East Side girl trying to fit in with the black hip-hop crowd, in James Toback&#x27;s drama &quot;Black and White&quot;, opposite Robert Downey Jr., Jared Leto, Brooke Shields and Elijah Wood. The film received mixed reviews and found a limited audience in theaters, but &quot;AllMovie&quot; remarked: &quot;[The film] starts off strong with a provocative performance by newcomer Bijou Phillips as the most unapologetic seeker of approval from her hip-hop-loving friends. Phillips eventually fades into the background, and the film becomes hampered by Toback&#x27;s insistence upon grafting a standard crime-drama plot&quot;.

===Acting breakthrough (2000–2005)===
Phillips appeared with Kate Hudson in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s semi-biographical musical drama &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000). The film was a critical success and received four Academy Award nominations. She also was the cover model for the April 2000 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, posing nude in that issue. 2001 saw Phillips star in two independent coming-of-age films. In &quot;Tart&quot;, opposite Dominique Swain and Melanie Griffith, she played the longtime friend of a young woman at a preparatory school in 1980s New York City. &quot;PopMatters&quot; found Phillips to be one of the only intriguing actors in the film, &quot;thanks to yet another fearless performance&quot;.

In &quot;Bully&quot;, based on the 1993 murder of Bobby Kent, she played one of several young adults in South Florida who plotted to murder a mutual friend that had emotionally, physically and sexually abused them for years. The film received a mixed critical response, but famed critic Roger Ebert was a notable admirer who gave it four out of four stars. Her performance in the film led &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; to name her one of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Stars of Tomorrow&quot;.

In 2003, Phillips starred alongside Mischa Barton as a member of a bizarre cult of young criminals in the thriller &quot;Octane&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2004, she played the nanny of an author&#x27;s young daughter, with Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, in &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; by John Irving. She also voiced the character Helena Wankstein, one of the optional in game girlfriends in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Phillips starred with Anne Hathaway in the crime drama &quot;Havoc&quot; (2005) as a spoiled socialite. &quot;ViewLondon&quot; wrote that the &quot;supporting cast are superb, particularly Bijou Phillips&quot; as the &quot;trashy best friend&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; asserted: &quot;As played by Hathaway and Phillips, the friendship between [their characters] rings girlish and true, and comes complete with tantalizing, lesbian-flavored moments&quot;. &quot;Havoc&quot; was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception. She appeared as an ill-fated high school senior in the slasher film &quot;Venom&quot; (also 2005), produced by Kevin Williamson.

===Horror films (2006–2009)===
In 2007, Phillips starred in the independent horror film &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot;, as the girlfriend of a magic magazine&#x27;s publisher. She also collaborated with actress Lauren German in three films, the first of which was the comedy drama &quot;Spin&quot;, about seven people at a popular Los Angeles nightclub. In &quot;&quot;, which served as a sequel to &quot;Hostel&quot; (2005), Phillips starred as one of three American female art students in Rome who are directed to a Slovak village, where they are kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill people. She claimed that her torture sequence, which entails her being scalped by a power saw, required around forty-five setups. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could do something like this again&quot;, she stated in a 2007 interview. &quot;I&#x27;m glad that I had the experience, and I love my job, but we went into places that I didn&#x27;t know existed, and I don&#x27;t need to do that again.&quot; Banned from theatrical release in several countries, &quot;Hostel: Part II&quot; was released theatrically in the United States, to lackluster box office returns.

The biographical film &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot; featured Phillips as Lorna Doom, the Germs&#x27; bassist and a close friend of singer Darby Crash. Director Rodger Grossman cast Phillips when she was 17 years old, and she stayed committed to the project for almost a decade as he worked to bring the film into production. She received critical acclaim for her portrayal; Phil Gallo for &quot;Variety&quot; found her performance to be &quot;striking&quot; and stated that her character &quot;lights up in a unique way whenever she&#x27;s in Crash&#x27;s company or simply talking about him&quot;. In 2008, Phillips appeared in a documentary about the Hotel Chelsea called &quot;Chelsea on the Rocks&quot;, directed by Abel Ferrara. She also starred, opposite Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, as a milkmaid in the well-received black comedy &quot;Choke&quot;, based on the Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel of the same name. In her last film of 2008, &quot;Dark Streets&quot;, Phillips played the alluring star singer of a club in 1930s New York City.

In 2009, Phillips had starring roles in four independent feature films, three of which were opposite Danny Masterson. Her first release in the year was the romantic comedy &quot;Wake&quot;, in which she played an emotionally isolated modern woman who meets a man mourning his fiancée at a funeral. The horror film &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot;, a remake of the 1974 film of the same name written and directed by Larry Cohen, saw Phillips star as the mother of a murderous baby. &quot;Dread Central&quot;, in its review for the film, noted: &quot;Bijou Philips is undoubtedly the star here, jumping into her role in what is admittedly just a piece of schlock cinema with great aplomb&quot;. In the comedy &quot;Made for Each Other&quot;, Phillips reunited with Lauren German to play a woman whose husband decides the only way to morally rectify his cheating is to get his wife to cheat on him. Her last 2009 film was the crime drama &quot;The Bridge to Nowhere&quot;, portraying a sex worker.

===Television and hiatus (2010–present)===
In FOX&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Raising Hope&quot; (2010–2014), Phillips played the title character&#x27;s biological mother, a serial killer sentenced to death. She appeared in a total of seven episodes of the series. In 2010 and 2012, she guest-starred in episodes of the police procedural television series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and in 2011 she appeared in the video for Broken Social Scene&#x27;s song &quot;Sweetest Kill&quot;. Phillips has not acted since her last appearance in &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, opting to focus on her family and health.

==Personal life==
Phillips dated Sean Lennon in the mid-2000s and became the subject matter of his 2006 album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;.

In 2004, Phillips began dating actor Danny Masterson and the two were married in October 2011. They are both Scientologists. On February 14, 2014, Phillips gave birth to their daughter. Phillips has starred with Masterson in several films and in a 2011 episode of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Raising Hope&quot;.

Masterson revealed in February 2017 that Phillips had been suffering from kidney disease for five years. She was born with small kidneys and suffered from a blood infection and was in need of a transplant, and for which she received one in April 2017.

In November 2017, actor Daniel Franzese alleged that Phillips had &quot;ridiculed&quot; him about his sexuality and weight, and physically assaulted him on the set of &quot;Bully&quot;. Phillips subsequently apologized for her behavior. The same month, actress Heather Matarazzo claimed that Phillips had held her against a wall and choked her shortly before filming for &quot;&quot; began.

Phillips has defended both her father and her husband (the former accused of rape and incest by Phillips&#x27;s half-sister Mackenzie; the latter convicted of the rape and sexual assault of multiple women) following allegations of their sexual abuse. Of Mackenzie&#x27;s allegations of sexual assault against their father, Phillips said in 2009, &quot;I&#x27;m 29 now, I&#x27;ve talked to everyone who was around during that time, I&#x27;ve asked the hard questions. I do not believe my sister. Our father [was] many things. This is not one of them.&quot; Phillips also stated that Mackenzie told her about their incestuous relationship, and that the news was &quot;confusing and scary&quot; and that she was &quot;heartbroken&quot; to think that her family left her alone with her father. In a 2000 interview with Bruce LaBruce, she discussed a song she had written about her father with the refrain, &quot;He touched me wrong&quot;, but did not go into detail about whether the lyrics referred to herself or someone else.

In May 2023, Phillips&#x27; husband Masterson was convicted of raping two women in 2003; charges from a third woman resulted in a hung jury. In September 2023, Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. Later that month, she filed for divorce.

<text>Nanduri Venkata Subbarao F.A., B.A., B.L. (16 December 1895 – 29 May 1957) was a famous Telugu poet. His famous works include &quot;Yenki Patalu&quot; (an anthology of songs on and by a woman called Yenki).

He was born in Vasanthavada in West Godavari district to Chinna Bapanna&#x27;s parents. His father was village &quot;Karanam&quot;. He was closely related to Basavaraju Apparao, but considered his guru.

After primary education at Eluru, he joined in Kakinada for College studies. Failing in some examinations, he was encouraged and shifted to Chennai. He passed his F.A. and joined Madras Christian College. He worked as a teacher for some time and succeeded in obtaining Bachelor in Law. He practiced law from 1926 onwards in Eluru. But his main ambition was poetry which he continued till the last days.

==Enki Paatalu==

Subba Rao conceptualized the idea of &#x27;Enki Paatalu&#x27; during his student days at Madras Christian College in 1917–18. He used the local dialects of Godavari and Visakha areas in his poems and received mixed criticism among his peers and friends. The first edition of &#x27;Enki Paatalu&#x27; was released in 1925. After a long gap of 27 years, the second edition was released with some new songs added. The poems left an indelible mark on the Telugu language and literature.

&#x27;Enki&#x27; and &#x27;Naidu Bava&#x27; are the main characters of the Enki Paatalu. &#x27;Enki&#x27; is a washer-woman who is in deep love with &#x27;Naidu Bava&#x27;. The central theme of the poems is the love and romance between them. One of the most famous Telugu singers, Parupalli Ramkrishnayya, set tunes to Yenki Paatalu for the first time. Nanduri always used to sing his songs in the same tunes. Eminent writers and thinkers like Adavi Bapiraju, Sri Sri, Chalam, Devulapalli Krishna Sastry adored &#x27;Enki Paatalu&#x27;. They gained public popularity due to the radio and music concerts.</text><links>

<text>Sergey Kobozev (Kostroma, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union; 20 July 1964 – 8 November 1995) was a Russian boxer, who challenged for the WBC Cruiserweight title in 1995. He is also known as a first boxer to defeat John Ruiz. He proved to be a tough slugger, but his career ended early after he was killed by the Russian mafia.

Kobozev was the Cruiserweight Champion of the Soviet Union. After moving to the United States, he continued his undefeated career and became the International Boxing Federation Cruiserweight Champion in July 1994. He was scheduled to fight Orlin Norris on March 12, 1995, for the WBA World Cruiserweight title, but the fight didn&#x27;t happen. In a bout for the WBC Cruiserweight title on October 24, 1995, he lost his title shot via a split decision. Shortly thereafter he was given another title shot opportunity at a rematch scheduled for December 13 for which he was training, he also had three big matches coming up, but on November 8, 1995, Kobozev was reported missing by his girlfriend Lina Cherskikh. Later surfaced that Kobozev was murdered by Russian mafia after a bar scuffle at Brooklyn&#x27;s Paradise Club the weekend of November 3, 1995.

==Early life==
Kobozev had been a captain in the Soviet Army and held a degree in chemistry from the Institute of Moscow, before he made his name as a cruiserweight on the Soviet national boxing team.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, Kobozev held wins over Ali Al-Baluchi and Garry Delaney.

==Professional career==
In 1990 Kobozev went to the United States, he lived in a fourth-floor apartment on 16th Street in a working-class section of Sheepshead Bay with his live-in companion Yelena Cherskikh, and her 7-year-old son, Vitaly. He was managed by Thomas Gallagher and trained by Peter Kahn.

He received a shot at the WBC title vacated by recently retired Anaclet Wamba, for which Kobozev fought Marcelo Fabian Dominguez in Paris and lost via a controversial decision.

Early in November 1995 Kobozev started training for a December 13 rematch versus Marcelo Fabian Dominguez to whom he lost a split decision, but soon he disappeared.

Kobozev&#x27;s ring record was 22 wins and 1 loss in 23 professional outings.

==Disappearance==
Kobozev disappeared in November 1995, just 2 weeks after losing a close split decision for the WBC Cruiserweight title, his very first career loss.

==Murder==
The mystery surrounding his death was solved when his bones were found by the FBI in March 1999 in the backyard of the Russian Mafia&#x27;s #2: Alexander Spitchenko in Livingston, New Jersey, United States. Kobozev&#x27;s body had been buried in a shallow grave. 

Kobozev was allegedly murdered by two reputed Russian mobsters, Alexander Nosov and Vasiliy Ermichine. Natan Gozman, a third defendant charged in the murder, remained a fugitive until February 2005, when he was arrested in Poland and extradited to New York, where he awaits trial.

Prosecutors said that the Russian mob allegedly turned against Kobozev because he worked as a part-time security guard at a Brooklyn restaurant from which Nosov was ejected after a fight with a musician. Several days after the fight, the defendants and a third member of the gang unexpectedly encountered Kobozev at a car repair shop, where they confronted him about the fight before Nosov shot him, authorities said. Still alive, Kobozev was put in a jeep and driven to the Livingston, N.J., home of a high-ranking member of the crime group, where his neck was broken by Ermichine after Kobozev asked to be taken to a hospital, prosecutors said.

<doc id="1173410" wikidata="Q703019" url="?curid=1173410" title="Kijirō Nambu">
<text>was a Japanese firearms designer and career officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. He founded the Nambu Arms Manufacturing Company, a major manufacturer of Japanese military firearms during the period. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (2nd class) in 1914. Because of his prolific firearms designs, Nambu has been described as the &quot;John Browning of Japan.&quot;

==Biography==
Nambu was born as the younger son to a former &quot;samurai&quot; retainer of the Nabeshima clan, in Saga domain in 1869 (present-day Saga prefecture). His mother died soon after he was born, and as his father had financial difficulties, he was sent out to be raised by a local merchant. Through hard work and determination, he secured a place in the 2nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy at the age of 20. At age 23, he was commissioned a lieutenant of artillery.

In 1897, Nambu was assigned to Tokyo Arsenal, where he was assigned to work under noted weapons designer Nariakira Arisaka on the Type 30 rifle project followed by the Type 26 revolver. He was then promoted to major and ordered to develop a semi automatic pistol for the Japanese military. This design, an 8mm pistol, was the earliest version of the famed Nambu pistol, and was completed in 1902. Nambu built a smaller and lighter 7mm version in 1907. The design was praised by then Army Minister Terauchi Masatake, but the Japanese army did not place it into production due to production costs. The larger version was eventually adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Special Naval Landing Forces, and the smaller version was sold commercially to private customers.

The Type 14 pistol was an improved version of the 1902 version, similar in dimensions and performance. It was issued to non-commissioned officers, while commissioned officers were expected to purchase their own side arms; it became the most common sidearm in use. Most of the pistols were produced by the Tokyo Arsenal with a smaller number manufactured by the Tokio Gasu Denky. Production of Type 14s lasted until the end of World War II in 1945. Total production numbers are estimated at approximately 200,000 for all variants.

During Nambu&#x27;s tour at the Army Rifle Manufacturing Plant (later renamed the Kokura Arsenal) he developed the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun in 1914 and the Type 11 light machine gun in 1922. In 1922, Nambu was promoted to lieutenant general and placed in charge of the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal. He reorganized the army arsenal system in 1923 and was named Commander of the Army Explosives Arsenal and Army Institute of Scientific research. In 1924, he retired from active military service,

Nambu founded the Nambu Arms Manufacturing Company in Tokyo in 1927, with financial backing from the Okura &quot;zaibatsu&quot; . Nambu received many contracts from both the Japanese army and navy for side arms, light machine guns and heavy machine guns, and also for testing and evaluation of many foreign designs. This included the Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, Type 94 8 mm Pistol, Type II machine pistol, Type 100 submachine gun and licensed production of the Type 99 light machine gun.

At the end of World War II, Nambu announced that his company would cease all weapons production; however, his facilities were sequestered under the American occupation authorities and continued to produce equipment (under the name &quot;Shin-Chuō Industries&quot;) for the police and subsequently for the post-war Japanese National Safety Forces, the predecessor to the current Japanese Self-Defense Force. Nambu died in May 1949, and his company was absorbed into the Japanese precision equipment manufacturer Minebea Co.

<doc id="1173454" wikidata="Q3155492" url="?curid=1173454" title="Isocolon">
<text>Isocolon is a rhetorical scheme in which parallel elements possess the same number of words or syllables. As in any form of parallelism, the pairs or series must enumerate like things to achieve symmetry. The scheme is called bicolon, tricolon, or tetracolon depending on whether they are two, three, or four parallel elements.

==Etymology==
The term, a compound of &quot;ísos&quot; &#x27;equal&#x27; and &quot;kôlon&quot; &#x27;member, clause&#x27; was used in the classical Greek rhetorical literature:
The Greek plural is &#x27;isocola&#x27;, but &#x27;isocolons&#x27; is also used in English.

==Bicolon==

An example of bicolon is the advertising slogan &quot;buy one, get one free&quot; (you pay for one item but you get another free).

In Biblical poetry it is standard to see a pair of adjacent lines of poetry in which the second echoes the meaning of the first. This can be considered a bicolon. For example:

# &quot;When Israel went out of Egypt, * the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:&quot;
# &quot;Judea made his sanctuary, * Israel his dominion.&quot;
# &quot;The sea saw and fled: * Jordan was turned back.&quot;
# &quot;The mountains skipped like rams, * and the hills like the lambs of the flock.&quot;
# &quot;What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: * and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?&quot;
# &quot;Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, * and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?&quot;
# &quot;At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, * at the presence of the God of Jacob:&quot;
# &quot;Who turned the rock into pools of water, * and the stony hill into fountains of waters.&quot;
::—Psalm 113:1-8 (Psalm 114 Hebrew)
== Tricolon ==
:&quot;Veni, vidi, vici&quot;
::— (Julius Caesar)

:&quot;I came; I saw; I conquered.&quot;

A tricolon that comprises parts in increasing size, magnitude or intensity is called a &quot;tricolon crescens&quot;, or an ascending tricolon. Tricolon can sometimes be a hendiatris.

Similarly, tricolon that comprises parts that decrease in size, magnitude, intensity, or word length is called a &quot;tricolon diminuens&quot;, or a descending tricolon.

Abraham Lincoln used tricolon in many of his speeches. His Gettysburg Address has the following phrase: &quot;We cannot dedicate – we cannot consecrate – we cannot hallow...&quot; Lincoln wrote in his second inaugural address, &quot;with malice toward none, with charity toward all, with firmness in the right...&quot;.

Winston Churchill used the tricolon frequently, as in his June 1941 speech regarding the German invasion of the Soviet Union, when he stated &quot;It is a war in which the whole British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations is engaged without distinction of race, creed or party.&quot;

Repeating the same thing multiple times is a special case of an isocolon, as a way of saying that only one thing is important, and it is very important. In about 1500, when Louis XII asked Giangiacopo Trivulzio what was necessary to win the war against Ludovico Sforza, Trivulzio answered: &quot;Three things, Sire, Money, money, money!&quot; In the 20th century, the cliché &quot;Location, location, location&quot; was said to enumerate the three most important attributes of real property. This phrase appears in print in Chicago as early as 1926, but is nonetheless frequently credited, incorrectly, to the British real estate magnate Lord Harold Samuel. British Prime Minister Tony Blair set out his priorities for office in 1997 with &quot;Education, education, education&quot;.

==Tetracolon==

Tetracola are sometimes called &quot;quatrains&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; the usual meaning of quatrain).

An example of a tetracolon may be cited from a poem by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio:
Another example can be cited from &quot;Richard II&quot;, by Shakespeare

==Special cases==
A special type of collocation known as an irreversible binomial is a bicolon that is both short and so well known that it becomes a fixed expression. Not all irreversible binomials are bicolons or tricolons, however. Irreversible binomials generally consist of only a few words at most.

Examples of irreversible binomials that are bicolons or tricolons:
*&quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;
*&quot;alive and kicking&quot;
*&quot;cloak and dagger&quot;
*&quot;command and control&quot;
*&quot;each and every&quot;
*&quot;part and parcel&quot;
*&quot;lie, cheat, or steal&quot;
*&quot;name it and claim it&quot;
*&quot;rank and file&quot;
*&quot;signed, sealed, and delivered&quot;
*&quot;tic-tac-toe&quot;
*&quot;finders, keepers; losers, weepers&quot;
*&quot;carpe diem, carpe noctem, carpe vitam&quot;
*&quot;in vino veritas, in aqua sanitas&quot;
*&quot;brain and brawn&quot;
*&quot;meat and potatoes&quot;
*&quot;rape and pillage&quot;
*&quot;divide and conquer&quot;
*&quot;tall, dark, and handsome&quot;
*&quot;pins and needles&quot;
*&quot;brains and beauty&quot;
*&quot;rock and roll&quot;
*&quot;spick and span&quot;
*&quot;chalk and cheese&quot;

Examples of irreversible binomials that are &quot;not&quot; bicolons or tricolons:
*&quot;lost and found&quot;
*&quot;between the devil and the deep blue sea&quot;
*&quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;
*&quot;double trouble&quot; (a verb and noun)
*&quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;
*&quot;over and done with&quot;
*&quot;Skull and crossbones&quot;
*&quot;sugar and spice and everything nice&quot;

<doc id="1173456" wikidata="Q16842898" url="?curid=1173456" title="Hi Rhythm Section">
<text>The Hi Rhythm Section was the house band for hit soul albums by several artists, including Al Green and Ann Peebles, on Willie Mitchell&#x27;s Hi Records label in the 1970s. The band included the three Hodges brothers, organist Charles Hodges, bassist Leroy Hodges and guitarist Mabon &quot;Teenie&quot; Hodges, together with pianist Archie Turner (or Michael Allen) and drummer Howard Grimes (or Stax Records drummer Al Jackson Jr., on most singles until his death in 1975). Many recordings also used The Memphis Horns - Wayne Jackson and Andrew Love - of Stax fame, usually with Willie&#x27;s brother James Mitchell arranging and (Perry) Michael Allen - piano (Alt). The recordings were made at producer Willie Mitchell&#x27;s Royal Recording Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.

==Band history==
The Hodges brothers began playing together in their father&#x27;s band, the Germantown Blue Dots, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Leroy Hodges then formed his own band, The Impalas, and came into contact with Memphis trumpeter and bandleader Willie Mitchell. Younger brother Teenie Hodges, then an aspiring bass player, was unofficially adopted by Mitchell in the mid-1960s, and became a member of his regular band, soon joined by Charles and Leroy. Mitchell also recruited first Al Jackson, and later Howard Grimes, from the Stax house band, and used his stepson Archie Turner as an additional keyboard player.

In the late 1960s, Mitchell and his band cut back on their touring schedule, to focus more on studio work. The Hi Rhythm Section&#x27;s distinctive, warm, swirling soul sound was a major ingredient in the success of the label through the 1970s. Three members of the Hodges family played guitar, organ and bass for the group; their naturally closeknit, familial warmth brought a unique, intuitive groove to the group&#x27;s sound. Along with contributions by other outstanding contemporary 1960s and 1970s Memphis studio sessions bands, such as The Mar-Keys, the Packers, and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, the Hi Rhythm Section helped define the sounds of the classic Memphis soul music genre. By the mid-1970s, they had appeared on nearly 20 gold and platinum albums and countless chart hits for Al Green, Ann Peebles, Syl Johnson, Otis Clay and others.

The Hodges brothers, with Grimes, recorded the 1976 LP &quot;On the Loose&quot; as Hi Rhythm.

The band dissolved after Hi Records was sold in 1977, but regrouped as a touring band in 1979. Through the 1980s and early 1990s, the Hodges brothers toured with singers Albert Collins and Otis Clay, and periodically regrouped with Grimes and Turner. Charles Hodges left in the 1990s, becoming an ordained church minister. In 1994, the album &quot;Perfect Gentlemen&quot; was released, featuring a fourth Hodges with the addition of Fred on keyboards as well as Percy Wiggins on vocals, issued on Velvet Recordings of America as by The Hodges Brothers.

Other band members still played together, sometimes with Jackson&#x27;s cousin Steve Potts on percussion, providing their unique backdrops for Syl Johnson on the Delmark Records CD &quot;Back in the Game&quot; (1994), and the Mitchell-produced Al Green comeback &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and its follow-up for the Blue Note label in 2003 and 2005. They also toured with Cat Power, aka Chan Marshall, and featured on her 2006 album &quot;The Greatest&quot;. In 2016, the group was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.

Canadian singer Frazey Ford recorded her 2014 album &quot;Indian Ocean&quot; songs &quot;September Fields&quot; and, &quot;I&#x27;m Done&quot;, at the Royal Studio, - the Hi Rhythm Section backing her with their unmistakeable signature Memphis sounds.

The Royal Recording Studio in Memphis is now included on the same tour with the landmark studios of Stax and Sun.

<doc id="1173462" wikidata="Q594126" url="?curid=1173462" title="Rolling Stones Records">
<text>Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. On 1 April 1971, the band signed a distribution deal for five albums with Ahmet Ertegun, acting on behalf of Atlantic Records. In the US, the albums were distributed by Atlantic until 1984. In the UK, Rolling Stones Records were distributed by WEA from 1971 to 1977 and by EMI from 1978 to 1984. In 1986, Columbia Records started distributing it in the United States and CBS for the rest of the world until 1991. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue and lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.

==History==
In its original concept, the label was formed to ensure the Rolling Stones would retain the rights over their own music, while also giving each bandmember the option to release solo albums. The first album to be released was &quot;Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka&quot; in 1971, a pioneering world music LP. In 1972 the label released &quot;Jamming with Edward!&quot;, a collection of tracks recorded by Jagger, Wyman, and Watts with Nicky Hopkins and Ry Cooder in 1969.

Bill Wyman released two solo albums through the label, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; in 1974 and &quot;Stone Alone&quot; in 1976. Wyman found that the label&#x27;s promotional and sales people paid very little attention to him, as the Rolling Stones had albums due out shortly after both releases which were the subject of major marketing campaigns. As a result, Wyman chose to record his next solo album with A&amp;M.

The label also released a solo single by Richards in December 1978, featuring a rendition of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot; backed by a version of Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;.

==Other artists==
Unlike Apple Records, Grunt Records, Purple Records, or Swan Song Records (the vanity labels of the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin respectively), Rolling Stones Records never made much of an effort to sign outside artists. Kracker, a Cuban American rock group produced by Rolling Stones producer, Jimmy Miller, was the first outside act to be signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1973. Kracker, along with Billy Preston, opened the show for the Stones during their 1973 European Tour. John Phillips was signed to Rolling Stones Records in 1976.

===Peter Tosh===

In 1977 Peter Tosh, a former member of Bob Marley&#x27;s band the Wailers signed a recording deal with Rolling Stones Records. His debut album on the label, &quot;Bush Doctor&quot;, which featured Jagger on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, was moderately successful. Despite further moderate success, Tosh left the label in 1981 due to personal problems with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, his band members and the recent passing of Bob Marley.

==1980s to the end==
Jagger released his first solo albums, &quot;She&#x27;s the Boss&quot; and &quot;Primitive Cool&quot;, in 1985 and 1987 respectively, through a newly conceived partnership between Rolling Stones Records and CBS Records (now Sony Music). Thus the trademark Rolling Stones logo was affixed to each record and the label &quot;Rolling Stones Records&quot; was also printed on each new release, which angered Richards. In fact, through the 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Rolling Stones Records&quot; continued to be printed on the labels of all new releases up through &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (1991). However, as the back catalogue has been shifted to Virgin/EMI, these markers are the last vapour trails of Rolling Stones Records. In 2008, the group switched distribution of Rolling Stones Records back catalogue material as well as new material to Polydor Records in the UK, and Interscope Records in the US (both imprints of Universal Music Group, also distributor of their pre-1971 catalogue as UMG is the distributor for ABKCO Records).

<doc id="1173470" wikidata="Q516354" url="?curid=1173470" title="Tel Dan stele">
<text>The Tel Dan Stele is a fragmentary stele containing an Aramaic inscription which dates to the 9th century BCE. It is the earliest known extra-biblical archaeological reference to the house of David. The stele was discovered in 1993 in Tel-Dan by Gila Cook, a member of an archaeological team led by Avraham Biran. Its pieces were used to construct an ancient stone wall that survived into modern times. The stele contains several lines of ancient Hebrew. The surviving inscription details that an individual killed Jehoram, King of Israel-Samaria, the son of Ahab, and Ahaziah of Judah, a king of the house of David. The stele is on display at the Israel Museum, It is known as KAI 310.

These writings corroborate passages from the Hebrew Bible, as the Second Book of Kings mentions that Jehoram is the son of an Israelite king, Ahab, by his Phoenician wife Jezebel. The likely candidate for having erected the stele, according to the Hebrew Bible, is Hazael, king of Aram-Damascus, whose language would have been Old Aramaic. He is mentioned in 2 Kings 12:17–18 as having conquered Israel-Samaria but not Jerusalem:

==Discovery and description==
Fragment A of the stele was discovered in July 1993 by Gila Cook of Avraham Biran&#x27;s team who was studying Tel Dan in northern Israel. Fragments B1 and B2 were found in June 1994. The stele was not excavated in its &quot;primary context&quot;, but in its &quot;secondary use&quot;. The fragments were published by Biran and his colleague Joseph Naveh in 1993 and 1995.

=== Overview ===
The Tel Dan stele consists of several fragments making up part of a triumphal inscription in Old Aramaic, left most probably by Hazael of Aram-Damascus, an important regional figure in the late 9th century BCE. The unnamed king boasts of his victories over the king of Israel and his apparent ally the king of the &quot;House of David&quot; (). It is considered the earliest widely accepted reference to the name David as the founder of a Judahite polity outside of the Hebrew Bible, though the earlier Mesha Stele contains several possible references with varying acceptance. 

A minority of scholars has disputed the reference to David, due to the lack of a word divider between &quot;byt&quot; and &quot;dwd&quot;, and other translations have been proposed. The Tel Dan stele is one of only four known extra-biblical inscriptions made during a roughly 400-year period (1200–800 BCE) containing the name &quot;Israel&quot;, the others being the Merneptah Stele, the Mesha Stele, and the Kurkh Monoliths.

The Tel Dan inscription generated considerable debate and a flurry of articles, debating its age, authorship, and authenticity; however, the stele is generally accepted by scholars as genuine and a reference to the house of David.

===Text===

The following is the transcription. Dots separate words (as in the original), empty square brackets indicate damaged/missing text, and text inside square brackets is reconstructed by Biran and Naveh: 
Romanized:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

The 1995 translation by Biran reads;

# [ ]...[...] and cut [...]
# [...] my father went up him when fought at [...]
# and my father lay down, he went to his [ancestors (viz. became sick and died)]. And the king of 
# rael entered previously in my father&#x27;s land, [and] Hadad made me king,
# And Hadad went in front of me, [and] I departed from the seven [...-]
# s of my kingdom, and I slew , who harnessed 
# riots and thousands of horsemen (or: horses). 
# king of Israel, and [I] killed 
# g of the House of David, and I set towns into ruins and turned ]
# their land into ]
# other [... and Jehu 
# led over and I laid]
# siege upon [ ]

Other scholars have presented alternate translations. For example, Andre Lemaire&#x27;s 1998 translation reads;

# [...]..[...] and cut [...]
# [...] my father went up 
# And my father lay down, he went to his [fathers]. And the kings of 
# rael penetrated into my father&#x27;s Hadad made me - myself - king
# And Hadad went in front of I departed from ... [...]
# of my kings. And I killed two who harnessed two 
# riots and two thousand horsemen. 
# king of Israel, and I killed 
# of the House of David. And I set [...]
# their land [...]
# other ...[... and Jehu 
# led over ...]
# siege upon [...]

The main differences are on line 6 and 7; Lemaire suggests that two kings, rather than seventy, were killed and that they possessed two thousand chariots and horsemen.

===Content===
In the second half of the 9th century BCE (the most widely accepted date for the stele), the kingdom of Aram-Damascus, under its ruler Hazael, was a major power in the Levant. Dan, just 70 miles from Hazael&#x27;s capital of Damascus, would almost certainly have come under its sway. This is borne out by the archaeological evidence: Israelite remains do not appear until the 8th century BCE, and apparently Dan was already in the orbit of Damascus even before Hazael became king in c. 843 BCE.

The author of the inscription mentions conflict with the kings of Israel and the &#x27;House of David&#x27;. The names of the two enemy kings are only partially legible. Biran and Naveh reconstructed them as Joram, son of Ahab, King of Israel, and Ahaziah, son of Joram of the House of David. Scholars seem to be evenly divided on these identifications. It is dependent on a particular arrangement of the fragments, and not all scholars agree on this.

In the reconstructed text, the author tells how Israel had invaded his country in his father&#x27;s day, and how the god Hadad then made him king and marched with him against Israel. The author then reports that he defeated seventy kings with thousands of chariots and horses (more on this below). In the very last line there is a suggestion of a siege, possibly of Samaria, the capital of the kings of Israel. This reading is, however, disputed.

==Interpretation and disputes==

===Configuration===
The stele was found in three fragments, called A, B1 and B2. There is widespread agreement that all three belong to the same inscription, and that B1 and B2 belong together. There is less agreement over the fit between A and the combined B1/B2: Biran and Naveh placed B1/B2 to the left of A (the photograph at the top of this article). A few scholars have disputed this, William Schniedewind proposing some minor adjustments to the same fit, Gershon Galil placing B above A rather than beside it, and George Athas fitting it well below.

===Dating ===
Archaeologists and epigraphers put the earliest possible date at about 870 BCE, whilst the latest possible date is &quot;less clear&quot;, although according to Lawrence J. Mykytiuk it could &quot;hardly have been much later than 750&quot;. However, some scholars (mainly associated with the Copenhagen school) – Niels Peter Lemche, Thomas L. Thompson, and F. H. Cryer – have proposed still later datings.

===Cracks and inscription===
Two biblical scholars, Cryer and Lemche, analyzed the cracks and chisel marks around the fragment and also the lettering towards the edges of the fragments. From this they concluded that the text was in fact a modern forgery. Most scholars have ignored or rejected these judgments because the artifacts were recovered during controlled excavations.

===Authorship===
The language of the inscription is a dialect of Aramaic. Most scholars identify Hazael of Damascus (c. 842 – 806 BCE) as the author, although his name is not mentioned. Other proposals regarding the author have been made: George Athas has argued for Hazael&#x27;s son Ben-Hadad III, which would date the inscription to around 796 BCE, and Jan-Wim Wesselius has argued for Jehu of Israel ().

===&quot;Seventy kings&quot;===
While the original translators proposed that line 6 of the inscription refers to the slaying of &quot;seventy kings&quot;, later epigraphers have offered alternative readings. Nadav Na&#x27;aman proposed that the line should be read as Hazael slew &quot;mighty kings&quot;. According to Lemaire, &quot;the reading &#x27;seventy&#x27; is based only on a very small fragment of a letter which is interpreted as part of an &#x27;ayin but could also be part of another letter&quot;. He proposed that the inscription should instead grammatically be read as &quot;two kings&quot; were slain, in line with the subsequent description of the inscription of only having defeated two kings. Other scholars have followed and further developed Lemaire&#x27;s reading.

Matthew Suriano has defended the &quot;seventy&quot; reading, arguing that it is a symbolic trope in ancient near eastern military language, representing the defeat of all other claimants to power. Noting that Hazael was himself a usurper to the throne of Aram-Damascus, he argues that ancient Syria would have posited a number of other rivals for the throne and that Hazael&#x27;s claim to have slain &quot;seventy kings&quot; is a reference to him defeating his rivals in succession to the throne of Aram-Damascus.

===&quot;House of David&quot;===
Since 1993–1994, when the first fragment was discovered and published, the Tel Dan stele has been the object of great interest and debate among epigraphers and biblical scholars. Its significance for the biblical version of Israel&#x27;s past lies particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a &quot;king of Israel&quot; and possibly a &quot;house of David&quot;. The latter reading is accepted by a majority of scholars, but not all.

Dissenting scholars note that word dividers are employed elsewhere throughout the inscription, and one would expect to find one between &quot;byt&quot; and &quot;dwd&quot; in &quot;bytdwd&quot; too if the intended reading was &quot;House of David&quot;. They contend that reading &quot;dwd&quot; as &quot;David&quot; is complicated since the word can also mean &quot;uncle&quot; (dōd) (a word with a rather wider meaning in ancient times than it has today), &quot;beloved&quot;, or &quot;kettle&quot; (dūd). Lemche and Athas suggests that &quot;bytdwd&quot; could be a place-name and Athas that it refers to Jerusalem (so that the author might be claiming to have killed the son of the king of Jerusalem, rather than the son of the king from the &quot;house of David&quot;). R.G. Lehmann and M. Reichel proposes interpreting the phrase as a reference to the name or epithet of a deity.

According to Anson Rainey the presence or absence of word dividers is normally inconsequential for interpretation. Word dividers as well as compound words are used elsewhere in the inscription and generally in West Semitic languages, so it is possible that the phrase was treated as a compound word combining a personal name with a relational noun. Mykytiuk argues that readings other than &quot;House of David&quot; are unlikely. Yosef Garfinkel has been vocally critical of alternate translations, characterizing them as &quot;suggestions that now seem ridiculous: The Hebrew &quot;bytdwd&quot; should be read not as &quot;the House of David&quot;, but as a place named &quot;betdwd&quot;, in parallel to the well-known place-name Ashdod. Other minimalist suggestions included &quot;House of Uncle&quot;, &quot;House of Kettle&quot; and &quot;House of Beloved&quot;.&quot;

Francesca Stavrakopoulou states that even if the inscription refers to a &quot;House of David&quot; it testifies neither to the historicity of David nor to the existence of a 9th-century BCE Judahite kingdom. Garfinkel argues that, combined with archaeological evidence unearthed at Khirbet Qeiyafa, the inscription&#x27;s reference to a &quot;king of the house of David&quot; constitutes primary evidence that David was a historical figure and the founder of a centralized Iron Age II dynasty.

<text>Six Days of the Condor is a thriller novel by American author James Grady, first published in 1974 by W.W. Norton. A suspense drama set in Washington, D.C., the plot was considerably revised for the 1975 film adaptation &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;. 

==Plot==
Ronald Malcolm is a CIA employee who works in a clandestine operations office in Washington, D.C. responsible for analyzing the plots of mystery and spy novels. One day, when he should be in the office, Malcolm slips out a basement entrance for lunch. In his absence a group of armed men gain entrance to the office and kill everyone there. Malcolm returns, realizes he is in grave danger, and telephones a phone number at CIA headquarters he has been given for emergencies.

When he phones in (and remembers to give his code name &quot;Condor&quot;), he is told to meet an agent named Weatherby who will &quot;bring him in&quot; for protection. However, Weatherby is part of a rogue group within the CIA, the same group responsible for the original assassinations. Weatherby tries to kill Malcolm, who manages to escape. On the run, Malcolm uses his wits to elude both the rogue CIA group and the proper CIA authorities, both of which have a vested interest in his capture or death.

Seeking shelter, Malcolm kidnaps a paralegal named Wendy Ross whom he overhears saying she will spend her coming vacation days holed up in her apartment. Knowing no one will notice her absence, Malcolm enlists her aid in finding out more about the forces after him. She is shot and seriously wounded in the process, but survives.

It is then revealed that the rogue group was using the section where Malcolm works to import illegal drugs from Laos. A supervisor stumbled onto a discrepancy in the records exposing this operation, thus necessitating the section&#x27;s elimination.

==Sequels==
Grady followed the novel with &quot;Shadow of the Condor&quot; in 1976, resuming the series in 2015 with the short story &quot;Next Day of the Condor&quot; and the novel &quot;Last Days of the Condor&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Sydney Pollack directed the 1975 film &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;, adapted by David Rayfiel and Lorenzo Semple from Grady&#x27;s novel.

Both the novel and the film were blended for the television adaptation &quot;Condor&quot;, first aired in 2018 on the Audience network, with Max Irons in the role of Condor/Joe Turner.

<text>Drug metabolism is the metabolic breakdown of drugs by living organisms, usually through specialized enzymatic systems. More generally, xenobiotic metabolism (from the Greek xenos &quot;stranger&quot; and biotic &quot;related to living beings&quot;) is the set of metabolic pathways that modify the chemical structure of xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism&#x27;s normal biochemistry, such as any drug or poison. These pathways are a form of biotransformation present in all major groups of organisms and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to detoxify poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is the object of pharmacokinetics. Metabolism is one of the stages (see ADME) of the drug&#x27;s transit through the body that involves the breakdown of the drug so that it can be excreted by the body.

The metabolism of pharmaceutical drugs is an important aspect of pharmacology and medicine. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug&#x27;s pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects multidrug resistance in infectious diseases and in chemotherapy for cancer, and the actions of some drugs as substrates or inhibitors of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous drug interactions. These pathways are also important in environmental science, with the xenobiotic metabolism of microorganisms determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during bioremediation, or persist in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the glutathione S-transferases are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to pesticides and herbicides.

Drug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidases introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalysed by transferase enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognised by efflux transporters and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts lipophilic compounds into hydrophilic products that are more readily excreted.

== Permeability barriers and detoxification ==

The exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress. The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal metabolism. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity enzymatic systems.

All organisms use cell membranes as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these cell membranes, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through transport proteins that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most hydrophilic molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognised by any specific transporters. In contrast, the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude lipid-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers.

However, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolise almost any non-polar compound. Useful metabolites are excluded since they are polar, and in general contain one or more charged groups.

The detoxification of the reactive by-products of normal metabolism cannot be achieved by the systems outlined above, because these species are derived from normal cellular constituents and usually share their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, specific enzymes can recognize and remove them. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the glyoxalase system, which removes the reactive aldehyde methylglyoxal, and the various antioxidant systems that eliminate reactive oxygen species.

== Phases of detoxification ==
The metabolism of xenobiotics is often divided into three phases: modification, conjugation, and excretion. These reactions act in concert to detoxify xenobiotics and remove them from cells.

=== Phase I – modification ===

In phase I, a variety of enzymes act to introduce reactive and polar groups into their substrates. One of the most common modifications is hydroxylation catalysed by the cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase system. These enzyme complexes act to incorporate an atom of oxygen into nonactivated hydrocarbons, which can result in either the introduction of hydroxyl groups or N-, O- and S-dealkylation of substrates. The reaction mechanism of the P-450 oxidases proceeds through the reduction of cytochrome-bound oxygen and the generation of a highly-reactive oxyferryl species, according to the following scheme:

:O2 + NADPH + H+ + RH → NADP+ + H2O + ROH

Phase I reactions (also termed nonsynthetic reactions) may occur by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, cyclization, decyclization, and addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, carried out by mixed function oxidases, often in the liver. These oxidative reactions typically involve a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (often abbreviated CYP), NADPH and oxygen. The classes of pharmaceutical drugs that utilize this method for their metabolism include phenothiazines, paracetamol, and steroids. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted at this point. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate.

A common Phase I oxidation involves conversion of a C-H bond to a C-OH. This reaction sometimes converts a pharmacologically inactive compound (a prodrug) to a pharmacologically active one. By the same token, Phase I can turn a nontoxic molecule into a poisonous one (toxification). Simple hydrolysis in the stomach is normally an innocuous reaction, however there are exceptions. For example, phase I metabolism converts acetonitrile to HOCH2CN, which rapidly dissociates into formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.

Phase I metabolism of drug candidates can be simulated in the laboratory using non-enzyme catalysts. This example of a biomimetic reaction tends to give products that often contains the Phase I metabolites. As an example, the major metabolite of the pharmaceutical trimebutine, desmethyltrimebutine (nor-trimebutine), can be efficiently produced by in vitro oxidation of the commercially available drug. Hydroxylation of an N-methyl group leads to expulsion of a molecule of formaldehyde, while oxidation of the O-methyl groups takes place to a lesser extent.

==== Oxidation ====
* Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system
* Flavin-containing monooxygenase system
* Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase
* Monoamine oxidase
* Co-oxidation by peroxidases

==== Reduction ====
* NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase
Cytochrome P450 reductase, also known as NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase, P450 reductase, POR, CPR, CYPOR, is a membrane-bound enzyme required for electron transfer to cytochrome P450 in the microsome of the eukaryotic cell from a FAD- and FMN-containing enzyme NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase
The general scheme of electron flow in the POR/P450 system is:
NADPH
FAD
FMN
P450
O2
* Reduced (ferrous) cytochrome P450

During reduction reactions, a chemical can enter &quot;futile cycling&quot;, in which it gains a free-radical electron, then promptly loses it to oxygen (to form a superoxide anion).

==== Hydrolysis ====
* Esterases and amidase
* Epoxide hydrolase

=== Phase II – conjugation ===

In subsequent phase II reactions, these activated xenobiotic metabolites are conjugated with charged species such as glutathione (GSH), sulfate, glycine, or glucuronic acid. Sites on drugs where conjugation reactions occur include carboxy (-COOH), hydroxy (-OH), amino (NH2), and thiol (-SH) groups. Products of conjugation reactions have increased molecular weight and tend to be less active than their substrates, unlike Phase I reactions which often produce active metabolites. The addition of large anionic groups (such as GSH) detoxifies reactive electrophiles and produces more polar metabolites that cannot diffuse across membranes, and may, therefore, be actively transported.

These reactions are catalysed by a large group of broad-specificity transferases, which in combination can metabolise almost any hydrophobic compound that contains nucleophilic or electrophilic groups. One of the most important classes of this group is that of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs).

=== Phase III – further modification and excretion ===

After phase II reactions, the xenobiotic conjugates may be further metabolized. A common example is the processing of glutathione conjugates to acetylcysteine (mercapturic acid) conjugates. Here, the γ-glutamate and glycine residues in the glutathione molecule are removed by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidases. In the final step, the cysteine residue in the conjugate is acetylated.

Conjugates and their metabolites can be excreted from cells in phase III of their metabolism, with the anionic groups acting as affinity tags for a variety of membrane transporters of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family. These proteins are members of the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters and can catalyse the ATP-dependent transport of a huge variety of hydrophobic anions, and thus act to remove phase II products to the extracellular medium, where they may be further metabolized or excreted.

== Endogenous toxins ==

The detoxification of endogenous reactive metabolites such as peroxides and reactive aldehydes often cannot be achieved by the system described above. This is the result of these species&#x27; being derived from normal cellular constituents and usually sharing their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, it is possible for enzymatic systems to utilize specific molecular recognition to recognize and remove them. The similarity of these molecules to useful metabolites therefore means that different detoxification enzymes are usually required for the metabolism of each group of endogenous toxins. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the glyoxalase system, which acts to dispose of the reactive aldehyde methylglyoxal, and the various antioxidant systems that remove reactive oxygen species.

== Sites ==

Quantitatively, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cell is the principal organ of drug metabolism, although every biological tissue has some ability to metabolize drugs.
Factors responsible for the liver&#x27;s contribution to drug metabolism include that it is a large organ, that it is the first organ perfused by chemicals absorbed in the gut, and that there are very high concentrations of most drug-metabolizing enzyme systems relative to other organs.
If a drug is taken into the GI tract, where it enters hepatic circulation through the portal vein, it becomes well-metabolized and is said to show the &quot;first pass effect&quot;.

Other sites of drug metabolism include epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys, and the skin.
These sites are usually responsible for localized toxicity reactions.

== Factors affecting drug metabolism ==

The duration and intensity of pharmacological action of most lipophilic drugs are determined by the rate they are metabolized to inactive products. The Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system is a crucial pathway in this regard. In general, anything that &quot;increases&quot; the rate of metabolism (e.g., enzyme induction) of a pharmacologically active metabolite will &quot;decrease&quot; the duration and intensity of the drug action. The opposite is also true, as in enzyme inhibition. However, in cases where an enzyme is responsible for metabolizing a pro-drug into a drug, enzyme induction can accelerate this conversion and increase drug levels, potentially causing toxicity.

Various &quot;physiological&quot; and &quot;pathological&quot; factors can also affect drug metabolism. Physiological factors that can influence drug metabolism include age, individual variation (e.g., pharmacogenetics), enterohepatic circulation, nutrition, sex differences or gut microbiota. This last factor has significance because gut microorganisms are able to chemically modify the structure of drugs through degradation and biotransformation processes, thus altering the activity and toxicity of drugs. These processes can decrease the efficacy of drugs, as is the case of digoxin in the presence of &quot;Eggerthella lenta&quot; in the microbiota. Genetic variation (polymorphism) accounts for some of the variability in the effect of drugs.

In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in fetal, neonatal and elderly humans and animals than in adults. Inherited genetic variations in drug metabolising enzymes result in their different catalytic activity levels. For example, N-acetyltransferases (involved in &quot;Phase II&quot; reactions), individual variation creates a group of people who acetylate slowly (&quot;slow acetylators&quot;) and those who acetylate quickly (&quot;rapid acetylators&quot;), split roughly 50:50 in the population of Canada. However, variability in &quot;NAT2&quot; alleles distribution across different populations is high and some ethnicities have higher proportion of slow acetylators. This variation in metabolising capacity may have dramatic consequences, as the slow acetylators are more prone to dose-dependent toxicity. NAT2 enzyme is a primary metaboliser of antituberculosis (isoniazid), some antihypertensive (hydralazine), anti-arrythmic drugs (procainamide), antidepressants (phenelzine) and many more and increased toxicity as well as drug adverse reactions in slow acetylators have been widely reported. Similar phenomenons of altered metabolism due to inherited variations have been described for other drug-metabolising enzymes, like CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DPYD, UGT1A1. &quot;DPYD&quot; and &quot;UGT1A1&quot; genotyping is now required before administration of the corresponding substrate compounds (5-FU and capecitabine for DPYD and irinotecan for UGT1A1) to determine the activity of DPYD and UGT1A1 enzyme and reduce the dose of the drug in order to avoid severe adverse reactions.

Dose, frequency, route of administration, tissue distribution and protein binding of the drug affect its metabolism. &quot;Pathological factors&quot; can also influence drug metabolism, including liver, kidney, or heart diseases.

&quot;In silico&quot; modelling and simulation methods allow drug metabolism to be predicted in virtual patient populations prior to performing clinical studies in human subjects. This can be used to identify individuals most at risk from adverse reaction.

== History ==

Studies on how people transform the substances that they ingest began in the mid-nineteenth century, with chemists discovering that organic chemicals such as benzaldehyde could be oxidized and conjugated to amino acids in the human body. During the remainder of the nineteenth century, several other basic detoxification reactions were discovered, such as methylation, acetylation, and sulfonation.

In the early twentieth century, work moved on to the investigation of the enzymes and pathways that were responsible for the production of these metabolites. This field became defined as a separate area of study with the publication by Richard Williams of the book &quot;Detoxication mechanisms&quot; in 1947. This modern biochemical research resulted in the identification of glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferases in 1961, followed by the discovery of cytochrome P450s in 1962, and the realization of their central role in xenobiotic metabolism in 1963.

<text>The Monastery of Great Lavra () is the first monastery built on Mount Athos, on the Athos peninsula in northeastern Greece. It is located on the southeastern foot of the Mount at an elevation of . The founding of the monastery in AD 963 by Athanasius the Athonite marks the beginning of the organized monastic life at Mount Athos. At the location of the monastery, there was one of the ancient cities of the Athos peninsula, perhaps Akrothooi, from which the sarcophagi of the monastery that are in the oil storage house come. The history of the monastery is the most complete compared to the history of the other monasteries, because its historical archives were preserved almost intact. It is possible that the study of these archives may contribute to the completion of the knowledge of the history of other monasteries, whose archives were partially or completely lost.

==Founding==
The founder of Great Lavra, Athanasius, began the construction of the buildings in 963, according to the will of his friend and Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas who funded the project. Nikephoros had promised Athanasius that he would soon become a monk of Great Lavra but the circumstances and his death canceled those plans. However, a permanent imperial grant, which was doubled by John I Tzimiskes, allowed the integration of the buildings. The emperors gave also the Great Lavra many other lands of property including the island of Saint Eustratius and the Monastery of Saint Andreas in Thessaloniki. This led to the growth of the monks from 80 to 120.

==Later history==
The building project, according to the biography of Athanasius the Athonite (11th century), began with the protective wall and continued to the church and cells. After Athanasius&#x27; death, the monastery continued its operation normally. The emperors favored its development and during the 11th century there were 700 monks, while smaller monasteries had been ceded to Great Lavra. In the 14th century the monastery suffered, like all the other monasteries of Mount Athos, from Spaniards from the crown of Aragon and other pirates. Additionally, the Russian pilgrim Isaiah confirms that, by the end of the 15th century, the monastery was Greek. The result of the crisis was the formation of a peculiar way of monasticism, the 
Idiorrhythmic Way, despite the objections of the official Church and the emperors. In 1574, the Patriarch of Alexandria, Sylvester, helped and the monastery operated again under cenobitic monasticism, but soon the peculiar monasticism was again introduced. In 1655, the Patriarch Dionysios III, who also became a monk, donated his personal fortune for the return to the cenobitic life but again these attempts were insufficient and the peculiar monasticism remained until the 20th century (1914), when there were new attempts for the return to the cenobitic life but without results.

Since 1980, the monastery has been cenobitic.

==Buildings==
The main church (Katholikon) was founded by Athanasius who lost his life together with 6 other workers when one of the domes fell during the construction. The architectural style of the temple is characterized by the two large areas of the chorus and the prayer. This style was then consecrated and was copied by the other monasteries. The frescoes were made in 1535 by the great painter Theophanis. However, the narthex was painted in 1854.

North of the narthex (&quot;liti&quot;), there is the chapel of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste in which there is the grave of Athanasius. South of the &quot;liti&quot;, there is the chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted by Franco Cantellano, in 1560. The trapeza opposite the central entrance has the shape of a cross and is the largest on Mount Athos. Its interior is full of frescoes, painted by Theophanis or his school.

== Art treasures ==

The library of the monastery is located behind the main church. It contains 2,116 Greek manuscripts and 165 codices. Among them uncial manuscripts of the New Testament: Codex Coislinianus, Codex Athous Lavrensis, Uncial 049, Uncial 0167, and minuscules 1073, 1505, 2524, 1519. There are also over 20,000 printed books, and about 100 manuscripts in other languages. The collection is one of the richest collections of Greek manuscripts in the world.

The vestry is behind the main church. Some of the most important artifacts are a manuscript of a gospel with a golden cover which is a gift from Nikephoros II Phokas and the list (Kouvaras) of the monks since Athanasius. There are also 2,500 icons which cover the whole history of hagiography of the second millennium.

==Climate==

Great Lavra enjoys a sunny and warm Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). January highs are around while July and August highs are around . According to the National Observatory of Athens station data, Great Lavra falls in hardiness zone 10a. 

== Namesakes ==
A plant species, &quot;Campanula lavrensis&quot;, is named after the Great Lavra.

<doc id="1173481" wikidata="Q979385" url="?curid=1173481" title="Heroes Are Hard to Find">
<text>Heroes Are Hard to Find is the ninth studio album by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 13 September 1974. This is the last album recorded with Bob Welch, who left the band at the end of 1974. It was the first Fleetwood Mac studio album recorded in the United States, in Los Angeles.

==Background==
The album was recorded during a low point for the group, with Bob Weston&#x27;s affair with drummer Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s wife causing a temporary disbandment. This led to subsequent legal problems when manager Clifford Davis organized a completely new lineup using the Fleetwood Mac name to fulfill their remaining tour dates. Welch convinced the band to relocate to America so they could be closer to their record label. Christine McVie was initially hesitant, but agreed to travel with the band to Los Angeles.

The band secured an injunction that prevented the fake Fleetwood Mac from performing, although Davis also won an injunction that temporarily barred the lineup of Fleetwood, the McVies, and Welch from touring or releasing any new music. Through the help of concert promoter Bill Graham, the lineup of Fleetwood, the McVies, and Welch managed to convince Warner Brothers that they were the real Fleetwood Mac. They negotiated a new contract with Warner Brothers, which allowed the band to release and perform music under the name Fleetwood Mac. The legal dispute with Davis was eventually settled out of court. &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot; was mixed at Angel City Sound in Los Angeles by Bob Hughes, who also served as a co-producer and engineer on the album.

The title track was edited and issued as a single but it failed to chart. Despite the lack of a charting single to support &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;, the album still managed to peak at No. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, which at the time was the highest &quot;Billboard&quot; placing for any Fleetwood Mac album. It also reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; FM Action chart.

Bob Welch later re-recorded &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; and &quot;Silver Heels&quot; for &quot;His Fleetwood Mac Years &amp; Beyond&quot; (2003). A re-write of &quot;Silver Heels&quot; with explicit lyrics, titled &quot;Hustler&quot;, appeared on &quot;Bob Welch Looks at Bop&quot; (1999).

==Cover art==
The cover art was taken by photographer Herbie Worthington using a three-way mirror. It features a shirtless Mick Fleetwood with his chest puffed out and his three year-old daughter Amelia standing on his shoes. Worthington later supplied the cover art for &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;. The lace underwear worn by Fleetwood was gifted to him by a close friend.

==Reception==
&quot;Heroes are Hard to Find&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; believed that &quot;Heroes are Hard to Find&quot; &quot;stacked up as a pleasant album&quot;, and singled out &quot;Prove Your Love&quot; as &quot;exquisitely pretty&quot; and &quot;Come a Little Bit Closer&quot; as &quot;a gorgeous tune reminiscent of the Beach Boys&quot;. Robert Christgau criticized the band for succumbing to pop cliches of the early 1970s, specifically their use of a string synthesizer, pedal steel, and &quot;half-assed horns&quot;. He dismissed Welch and McVie for sounding bored and &quot;less than perfect&quot; respectively and labeled &quot;Heroes are Hard to Find&quot; as their worst album to date. Retrospective reviews were more positive, with Hal Horowitz of AllMusic complimenting the songwriting abilities of Welch and McVie and praising the album for being both cohesive and diverse.

<doc id="1173482" wikidata="Q7830395" url="?curid=1173482" title="Toxication">
<text>Toxication, toxification or toxicity exaltation is the conversion of a chemical compound into a more toxic form in living organisms or in substrates such as soil or water. The conversion can be caused by enzymatic metabolism in the organisms, as well as by abiotic chemical reactions. While the parent drug is usually less active, both the parent drug and its metabolite can be chemically active and cause toxicity, leading to mutagenesis, teratogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Different classes of enzymes, such as P450 monooxygenases, epoxide hydrolase, or acetyltransferases can catalyze the process in the cell, mostly in the liver.

Parent non-toxic chemicals are generally referred to as &quot;protoxins&quot;. While toxication is generally undesirable, in certain cases it is required for the &quot;in vivo&quot; conversion of a prodrug to a metabolite with desired pharmacological or toxicological activity. Codeine is an example of a prodrug, metabolized in the body to the active compounds morphine and codeine-6-glucuronide.

== Toxication by enzymatic metabolism ==

=== CYP450 enzymes ===

Phase I of drug metabolism are bioactivation pathways, which are catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes, produce toxic metabolites and thus have the potential to damage cells. The unusual level of activity CYP450 enzymes might lead to the changes in drug metabolism and convert drugs into their more toxic forms. Among Phase I CYP450 enzymes, the subfamilies CYP2D6 and CYP3A are responsible for hepatotoxicity during drug metabolism with a number of different drugs, including flucloxacillin, troleandomycin, and troglitazone. Hepatotoxicity indicates the drug&#x27;s toxicity to liver.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is converted into the hepatotoxic metabolite NAPQI via the cytochrome P450 oxidase system, mainly by the subfamily CYP2E1. Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) will detoxify this formed NAPQI quickly if APAP is taken at a proper level. In the case of overdoses, the storage of GSH will not be enough for NAPQI detoxication, thereby resulting in acute liver injury.

=== Other oxidoreductases ===
Oxidoreductases are enzymes that catalyze the reactions that involve the transfer of electrons. Methanol in itself is toxic due to its central nervous system depression properties, but it can be converted to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase, which are significantly more toxic. Formic acid and formaldehyde can cause severe acidosis, damage to the optic nerve, and other life-threatening complications.

Ethylene glycol (common antifreeze) can be converted into toxic glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glycolate oxidase in mammalian organisms. The accumulation of the end product of the ethylene glycol mechanism, calcium oxalate, may cause malfunction in the kidney and lead to more severe consequences.
=== Other examples ===
Other examples of toxication by enzymatic metabolism include:

* Conversion of secondary amines in the stomach into carcinogenic nitrosamines via NO pathway.
* Nicotine into the nitrosated carcinogenic NNK (&quot;4-(methylnitrosamino)- 1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone&quot;) in the lung.
* Benzo[a]pyrene into the carcinogenic &quot;benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide&quot; (BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide) 
* Hypoglycin A into the highly toxic MCPA-CoA

== Toxication by abiotic chemical reactions ==
Increases in toxicity can also be caused by abiotic chemical reactions. Non-living elements affect the abiotic chemical reactions. Anthropogenic trace compounds (ATCs) have potential toxicity to the organisms in aquatic system.

Arsenic contamination in drinking water can be chemically toxic. The uptake and metabolism of arsenic may result in damage to the body. When organic arsenic is converted into more toxic inorganic arsenic, it causes carcinogenesis, cytotoxicity (toxic to cells) and genotoxicity (causing mutations in genes).

<doc id="1173494" wikidata="Q7442069" url="?curid=1173494" title="Seattle Children's">
<text>Seattle Children&#x27;s (previously Children&#x27;s Hospital and Regional Medical Center; previously Children&#x27;s Orthopedic Hospital) is a children&#x27;s hospital in the Laurelhurst neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The hospital specializes in the care of infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 in several specialties.

==History==
The hospital was founded as the seven-bed Children&#x27;s Orthopedic Hospital in 1907 by Anna Herr Clise after her 5-year-old son, Willis, died of inflammatory rheumatism in 1898. It was originally a ward of the downtown Seattle General Hospital. It moved to a cottage on Queen Anne Hill the next year, and in 1911 influential community members including Herbert Gowen and Mark A. Matthews dedicated a full 40-bed hospital at the same location.

The library at the hospital was founded in 1946.

In 1953, Children&#x27;s moved to a new campus in Laurelhurst, east of the University of Washington (See 1951-1953: A New Campaign). 

A research division, Seattle Children&#x27;s Research Institute (SCRI), was established in 2006.

In December 2007, Seattle Children&#x27;s purchased a seven-story building in the Denny Triangle, near downtown Seattle and South Lake Union. With this purchase, Children&#x27;s acquired nearly 2 square blocks for the research institute.

In 2008, the institution formally changed its name to Seattle Children&#x27;s. In 2008, the hospital was awarded Magnet recognition by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) and was recognized again in 2013. Also the same year, the SCRI received a $1M donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

In 2010, Seattle Children&#x27;s opened a clinic in Bellevue, Washington.

In 2011, Seattle Children&#x27;s began charging an added facility charge for hospital-based clinic visits, including urgent care.

In 2013, Seattle Children&#x27;s opened a 330,000 square foot expansion at the main campus in Seattle. The expansion included a new cancer and critical care unit as well as a new emergency department with 38 exam rooms. The facility added 80 new private beds in single patient rooms. The building is expected to use 47 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than similar-sized hospitals in the region.

In 2013 Seattle Children&#x27;s filed a lawsuit against the Washington State Insurance commissioner for certifying insurance plans in the state&#x27;s new health insurance exchange (established under the Affordable Care Act) for failing to provide coverage for the hospital; the hospital also filed an administrative appeal with the insurance commissioner&#x27;s office. The hospital dropped the suit and appeal in 2014 when several insurance plans covered it.

In 2014, Seattle Children&#x27;s received the largest donation in its history: $73.9M from Jack R. MacDonald. The same year, its Research Institute received a $3M donation from the BMGF for an Infant Breathing Support Invention.

In 2017 the hospital had a total of 403 beds.

In 2018, the hospital broke ground on a new 310,000-square-foot addition to the hospital. The new nine floor addition features eight new operating rooms, two cardiac catheterization labs, 20 inpatient rooms, a new outpatient clinical space for the oncology and hematology center and an outpatient infusion center. The new addition will cost around $400 million and open up in 2022.

In 2019, the Seattle Center for Infectious Disease Research was absorbed by the SCRI.

In November 2020, Seattle Children&#x27;s launched Seattle Children&#x27;s Therapeutics, a nonprofit therapeutics development enterprise devoted to envisioning next-generation therapies for pediatric diseases. Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson also collaborated with Microsoft and billionaire Bill Gates to donate Xbox Series X consoles to the Seattle Children&#x27;s along with 19 other children&#x27;s hospitals throughout the country.

== Controversies ==
In 2015 the hospital warned the public that due to its improper sterilization of surgical equipment, around 12,000 children and young adults treated there since 2010 were at risk of infection from bacteria or blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV; it had issued a similar warning two years earlier.

From 2001 on, it was revealed that a strain of deadly mold in the air handling systems of operating rooms (Aspergillus) was detected by hospital administrators. The mold caused 14 infections and 6 deaths. In 2018 the mold was revealed and hospital staff agreed to clean up the mold. HEPA filters were installed and operating rooms were reopened in July that year. In November 2019, mold allegations again resurfaced when an infant tested positive for a mold infection. In early 2020, the health inspectors from the State of Washington came in and questioned hospital authorities on why HEPA filters were not installed in the ORs. The mold has led to a lawsuit.

The move follows a pledge that the hospital would undertake a ‘rigorous’ review following the departure of Dr. Ben Danielson.

===Texas transgender investigation===

In November 2023, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a civil investigative demand to the hospital for any and all medical records of transgender minors being treated at the hospital, as well as the number of children originally from Texas being treated at the hospital, and guidance for how to “wean” trans patients off gender affirming medication. The demand cited Texas laws banning the care, despite the hospital being located outside of Texas. In response, the hospital filed suit.

<doc id="1173504" wikidata="Q1021175" url="?curid=1173504" title="First Ivorian Civil War">
<text>The First Ivorian Civil War was a civil conflict in the Ivory Coast (also known as Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) that began with a military rebellion on 19 September 2002 and ended with a peace agreement on 4 March 2007. The conflict pitted the government of Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo against a domestic insurgency led by the New Forces of Ivory Coast (&quot;Forces nouvelles de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;). Following the war, a second civil war (2010–2011) would begin over the results of the 2010 Ivorian presidential election.

The war was preceded by a tumultuous decade in the Ivory Coast, marked by an economic downturn and, following the death of long-time Ivorian President Félix Houphouët-Boigny in 1993, a leadership succession crisis. The succession crisis manifested in a 1999 military coup d&#x27;état and a violent dispute over the result of the 2000 presidential election. Three successive Ivorian leaders – Henri Konan Bédié from 1993, Robert Guéï from 1999, and Gbagbo from 2000 – exploited the ideology of Ivoirité to repress and marginalise political opposition, notably by disqualifying Alassane Ouattara from contesting elections on the basis of his putative Burkinabé nationality; in the process, these leaders stoked ethnic tensions and xenophobic sentiment in the country. The rebellion which ignited the war was driven by forces which sought a re-run of the 2000 election and reform of exclusionary citizenship policies.

War broke out on 19 September 2002 when troops opposed to President Gbagbo – and under the political leadership of the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast (MPCI, &quot;Mouvement patriotique de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;) – attacked three Ivorian cities, including Abidjan. Though they failed to take Abidjan, the rebels quickly established control over much of the north of the country. Two new rebel groups along the Liberian border, the Movement for Justice and Peace (&quot;Mouvement pour la justice et la paix&quot;) and the Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (&quot;Mouvement populaire ivoirien du Grand Ouest&quot;), battled government forces for western territory, before uniting with MPCI as the New Forces in December 2002. Across the country, opposition supporters clashed with the Young Patriots (&quot;Congrès panafricain des jeunes et des patriotes&quot;) and other pro-government militias.

The conflict attracted an extraordinary amount of international attention. Ivory Coast&#x27;s former colonial power, France, launched a military intervention soon after the initial rebellion. Though Opération Licorne had a protection mandate and pleaded its neutrality in the conflict, the French intervention was attacked by Ivorian nationalists as a manifestation of neocolonialism, leading to sustained public demonstrations and in 2004, fatal clashes between Ivorian and French forces. The United Nations (UN) was involved in the conflict first through a political mission, the UN Mission in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and then through an ambitious peacekeeping mission, the UN Operation in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, which deployed in April 2004 and absorbed the smaller contingent of peacekeepers that had been deployed earlier by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

The violence had largely subsided by the end of 2004, but the country remained under &quot;de facto&quot; partition – with a rebel-held north and a government-held south – while the political crisis continued. Though the multi-party Linas-Marcoussis Accord established a power-sharing Government of National Reconciliation in early 2003, its provisions regarding disarmament and political reform were not implemented. A comprehensive political settlement was finally reached in 2007, when Gbagbo and the New Forces signed the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. However, when the Ivory Coast held its presidential elections in 2010, the first since 2000, Gbagbo refused to accept the result, sparking a renewed political crisis and the beginning of the Second Ivorian Civil War.

==Origins and context==
=== Leadership succession ===
When Ivorian President Félix Houphouët-Boigny died in 1993, the end of his thirty-three-year presidency inaugurated a prolonged &quot;crisis of succession&quot;, which destabilised Ivorian politics for the remainder of the 1990s. Since the Ivory Coast&#x27;s independence from France in 1960, Houphouët-Boigny had maintained Ivorian political and economic stability using mechanisms largely dependent on his own personal charisma, networks, and so-called Françafrique connections; the country lacked established mechanisms to regulate democratic competition. As required by the constitution following his death, Houphouët-Boigny was succeeded by Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly, who also replaced Houphouët-Boigny at the head of the ruling Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI, French: &quot;Parti démocratique de la Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;). However, ahead of the 1995 presidential election, opposition politicians began to organise for democratic regime change in open and competitive elections.

One powerful opposition leader was Laurent Gbagbo, whose Ivorian Popular Front (FPI, &quot;Front populaire ivoirien&quot;) had long agitated for democratisation under Houphouët-Boigny. Another was Alassane Ouattara, Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s Prime Minister, who had launched an abortive challenge to Bédié&#x27;s leadership in the weeks after Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s death, and who in 1994 split from PDCI to establish his own party, Rally of the Republicans (RDR, &quot;Rassemblement des républicains&quot;). Both opposition groups boycotted the 1995 election in protest of changes to the electoral code : Bédié&#x27;s PDCI retained power, but at the cost of harming its popular legitimacy. After 1995, the opposition continued to gain political ground. This political change coincided, from the late 1990s, with renewed economic downturn in Ivory Coast, exacerbated by the liberalisation of key agricultural sectors, notably coffee and cocoa, under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment programme.

=== Ivoirité ===

Ivory Coast has historically received large numbers of immigrants from neighbouring West African countries, especially Burkina Faso, and the flow of immigration was sustained after independence, both due to Ivory Coast&#x27;s relative prosperity and due to the favourable policies of Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s government: for example, between 1960 and 1972, any person born in Ivory Coast could receive Ivorian citizenship, regardless of their parents&#x27; nationality. A majority of immigrants were Muslim: the share of Muslims in the Ivorian population increased from approximately six per cent in 1922 to 38.6 per cent in 1998. By then, they outnumbered the country&#x27;s Christians, and were particularly numerous in the north of the country. Although immigration slowed from the 1990s, the Muslim population continued to grow in demographic importance due to a widening fertility gap.

Academic analyses agree that a key root cause of the Ivorian civil war was the spread of nativist and xenophobic discourse, its mobilisation by opportunistic politicians, and the resulting ethnic tensions. Central in this regard was the rise of Ivoirité as an ideology and state policy under President Bédié, and its use to marginalise and exclude immigrants, their descendants, and certain groups of Ivorian citizens. Ethnic tensions, xenophobic sentiment, and related communal disputes in Ivory Coast predated Bédié&#x27;s rule, but Houphouët-Boigny had been able to accommodate, manage, and suppress them. Under Bédié, however, the rise of Ivoirité politicised such disputes, making origin and religious affiliation &quot;the prime markers of identity&quot; in Ivory Coast. Land disputes were increasingly framed in ethnic terms, and became increasingly common in the late 1990s: Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s liberal land policies had extended access to land to both internal and foreign migrants, and rising urban unemployment in the 1990s – resulting in back-migration to rural areas – led to intensified competition over fertile land.

Sociologist Francis Akindès notes that Ivoirité under Bédié had undertones which valorised Akan identity (the ethnic group of both Bédié and Houphouët-Boigny) and Christian identity; but the central variant of Ivoirité was framed as a form of patriotism and used national origin as the measure of &quot;Ivorianness&quot;. Yet adjudicating residents&#x27; claims to Ivorian nationality was a complicated task, resting on a controversial distinction between &quot;indigenous&quot; Ivorians and Ivorians &quot;of immigrant ancestry&quot;. Groups perceived as foreign had long histories of migration to Ivory Coast, both before and during colonialism – Burkinabés, for example, had been represented among Ivorian residents since before states existed in either Burkina Faso or Ivory Coast – and many of their members had been citizens for multiple generations. In this context, even the more inclusive nationality-based variant of Ivoirité had a marked tendency to denigrate and exclude groups of Ivorian citizens, notably the Dioula population of northern Ivory Coast.

Ouattara was himself Dioula – though he insisted he was an Ivorian national – and drew much of his support base from the predominantly Muslim north, particularly poor immigrants and their descendants on northern agricultural plantations. In November 1994, ahead of the 1995 presidential election, Bédié had the National Assembly amend the electoral code to require that presidential candidates should be Ivorian-born with two Ivorian-born parents (where previously only one such parent had been required). This was viewed as a strategic move to avert a leadership challenge from Ouattara, who at that point remained Bédié&#x27;s rival inside PDCI.

=== Coup and election violence ===
Former army commander Robert Guéï assumed power in December 1999, in a coup d&#x27;état which overthrew Bédié. The coup originated in a mutiny, itself occasioned by Bédié&#x27;s refusal to release detained RDR members or to meet other demands of the relevant faction of the military. Guéï had been fired by Bédié in 1995, reportedly because he declined to deploy the military during pre-election public demonstrations, and, once in office, he said that the new military government would seek to reverse Bédié&#x27;s changes to the electoral code. However, it did the opposite: in July 2000, the Ivory Coast adopted by referendum a constitutional amendment which, under article 35 of the constitution, would permanently restrict eligibility for the presidency to those &quot;of Ivorian origin, born of a father and mother who are also Ivorian by birth&quot;. This provision was used to maintain Ouattara&#x27;s disqualification, and the candidacy of other opposition leaders was also blocked. As a result, Gbagbo was the only major opposition figure allowed to challenge Guéï in the 2000 presidential election. Gbagbo won the election, although Guéï refused to cede power to him until forced to do so by violent public protests in which 206 people were killed and 1,207 injured. In the violence, FPI supporters reportedly targeted not only Guéï&#x27;s forces but also supporters of Ouattara&#x27;s RDR, as well as northerners and immigrants who they assumed supported RDR.

President Gbagbo took up the mantle of Ivoirité and further entrenched it in state institutions. According to Human Rights Watch, Gbagbo&#x27;s security forces committed abuses against civilians, targeting – on the basis of their nationality, ethnicity, or religion – immigrants, their descendants, and Ivorians from the north. Moreover, in 2001, the FPI government introduced a new national identification system, under which residents applying for official identity documents were required to prove their nationality, including the locality of their place of birth, to a new National Identification Office (ONI, &quot;Office national d&#x27;identification&quot;). This policy affected the voting rights not only of immigrants but also of many northern Ivorians. Thus the political transition to Gbago&#x27;s government did little to ease ethnic tensions. For related reasons, and as throughout Guéï&#x27;s rule, the mood in the military remained generally mutinous, and Gbagbo faced opposition from both Guéï loyalists and Ouattara sympathisers within the army. An attempted coup in January 2001, which Gbagbo blamed on the interference of Burkina Faso, led to renewed attacks on Burkinabé residents by FPI supporters.

==Belligerents==
=== Rebel forces ===
The primary rebel force in the civil war was the New Forces of Ivory Coast (FNCI, &quot;Forces nouvelles de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;), created in December 2002 as a coalition between the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast (MPCI, &quot;Mouvement patriotique de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;), the Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (MPIGO, &quot;Mouvement populaire ivoirien du Grand Ouest&quot;), and the Movement for Justice and Peace (MJP, &quot;Mouvement pour la justice et la paix&quot;). Guillaume Soro led the MPCI, whose insurgency began the war, and he became the general secretary of FNCI. At least a significant portion of MPCI was aligned or sympathetic to the Rally of the Republicans (RDR, &quot;Rassemblement des républicains&quot;), Alassane Ouattara&#x27;s opposition party, while MPIGO and MJP claimed allegiance to Ivory Coast&#x27;s former military leader, Robert Guéï, who died at the beginning of the war.

The Ivorian government claimed that MPCI was supported by Burkina Faso, an allegation which Burkinabé President Blaise Compaore repeatedly denied. The International Crisis Group, however, regarded the allegation as plausible: sources in the Burkinabé government reported that arms had been delivered to the rebels by air, and Western intelligence proved that some of the arms used in the rebels&#x27; initial attacks had come from the Burkinabé Presidential Guard stocks. However, both International Crisis Group and Western intelligence reports gave less credence to Gbagbo&#x27;s further accusation that Burkinabé troops had participated directly in the initial attacks. MPIGO and MJP were reported to have received assistance from the Liberian government, reflecting a partial spillover of the Liberian Civil War, and, according to a March 2003 report by Global Witness, 90% of MJP and MPIGO forces were Liberian or Sierra Leonean mercenaries, many of them ex-members of Charles Taylor&#x27;s Revolutionary United Front.

=== Government forces ===
President Laurent Gbagbo was supported by loyalists in the state security services and National Armed Forces (FANCI, &quot;Forces armées nationales de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;). In addition, he reportedly recruited foreign mercenaries, some of whom had previously been affiliated with the South Africa-based Executive Outcomes, and including a number of Belarusian pilots. Various civilian militias supported Gbagbo and his political party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI, &quot;Front populaire ivoirien&quot;) – the most important among them was the Young Patriots&#x27; Pan-African Congress (COJEP, &quot;Congrès panafricain des jeunes et des patriotes&quot;). In 2005, Human Rights Watch reported that the Ivorian government had also recruited foreign combatants, primarily from Liberia, and including child soldiers. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, between 2002 and 2004, the Ivorian government purchased arms from Angola, Belarus, Bulgaria, Israel, Romania, and Ukraine.

=== International forces ===
The French military launched its intervention in Ivory Coast, Opération Licorne, on 22 September 2002, three days after the start of the war, with an initial focus on protecting French and other foreign nationals. Originally a contingent of 700, Opération Licorne comprised 4,000 troops by July 2003. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) deployed its own peace force on 18 January 2003.

The United Nations (UN) had an official presence in Ivory Coast from 6 February 2003, when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed Albert Tévoédjrè as his Special Representative in Ivory Coast. From 27 June 2003, Tévoédirè was supported by the UN Mission in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (MINUCI, &quot;Mission des Nations unies en Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;), established by Resolution 1479 of the UN Security Council, with a mandate to monitor implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Accord. The following year, Security Council Resolution 1528 replaced MINUCI with an ambitious peacekeeping operation, the United Nations Operation in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UNOCI). UNOCI deployed on 4 April 2004 and helped France police the buffer zone between the belligerents. It had an initial authorised strength of 6,240 uniformed personnel, and was further expanded by Resolution 1609 in 2005 and Resolution 1682 in 2006. By mid-2007, it comprised just over 9,000 uniformed personnel from more than 40 countries. ECOWAS re-hatted its troops and handed over to UNOCI in April 2004, but, for practical and financial reasons, the Security Council allowed the French Operation Licorne to remain in place under its own chain of command.

==Outbreak of civil war==

=== Military rebellion: 19 September 2002 ===

The &quot;opening salvo&quot; in the war was a rebellion against Gbagbo&#x27;s government by Ivorian troops, who on 19 September 2002 executed a well-coordinated simultaneous attack on three Ivorian cities, including the largest city, Abidjan. It was reportedly planned by former pro-RDR or pro-Guéï dissidents in the military and in the Student Federation of Ivory Coast (FESCI, &quot;Fédération estudiantine et scolaire de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;). According to the International Crisis Group, the rebellion involved about 750 troops, but it reportedly originated in a smaller protest of about 200 soldiers, primarily from the north of the country, who objected to their demobilisation by the government, viewing it as ethnically motivated.

A severe response from the government – which included demolishing the homes of immigrant workers accused of supporting the rebellion – was supported by &quot;ad hoc&quot; pro-government militias. Guéï was shot dead on the day of the rebellion – according to his family, while having lunch – &quot;in circumstances that lead many to believe the government wanted him eliminated&quot;. After Ouattara&#x27;s house was burned down, he took refuge at the French ambassador&#x27;s residence; while former President Bédié was accommodated at the Canadian ambassador&#x27;s residence. Having failed to take Abidjan, the rebels – who later identified themselves as the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast (MPCI, &quot;Mouvement patriotique de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;) – retreated northwards, and they quickly established control over much of the north, including the cities of Bouaké and Korhogo.

=== French intervention: 22 September 2002 ===
Ivory Coast&#x27;s former colonial power, France, was invested in the outcome of the conflict – given its significant business interests in Ivory Coast, and the presence of more than 20,000 French citizens there – but was extremely reluctant to intervene in support of Gbagbo. Nonetheless, on 22 September, France launched Operation Licorne, with an initial mandate focused on protecting and evacuating French nationals and other foreign nationals. Indeed, in the weeks after the rebellion, French and American forces evacuated 2,500 people – mostly foreign nationals – from the Ivory Coast. Operation Licorne was initially staffed by the 650 troops regularly based in Ivory Coast under the terms of a bilateral defence agreement. These were soon supplemented by additional troops shifted from French bases in Gabon and other African countries, as well as by a deployment of 70 additional paratroopers in October. France emphasised the forces&#x27; protection mandate, saying repeatedly that it was not intervening in the conflict, but the presence of French troops soon became crucial to the government&#x27;s security, for example in barring rebel advances on the capital city, Yamoussoukro. It was also reported that France had agreed to provide Gbagbo&#x27;s government with logistical support and tactical advice. However, both sides – the government and the rebels – accused France of supporting the other, and the French intervention faced opposition from a segment of the Ivorian public: on 22 October, French troops dispersed a demonstration outside their base, using grenades and tear gas to do so.

=== Partial ceasefire: October–December 2002 ===
The conflict continued to intensify, as both sides recruited and armed thousands of civilians – and, on the government side, contracted foreign mercenaries. However, on September 29, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) launched peace negotiations in Accra, Ghana, under the mediation of a high-level contact group comprising representatives from Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo. This initiative resulted on 17 October in a ceasefire between MPCI and the Ivorian government, as well as an agreement to continue substantive peace talks under ECOWAS auspices. Further bilateral talks were held in Lomé, Togo, in October and November, but failed to break a political deadlock: MPCI demanded Gbagbo&#x27;s removal, fresh elections, and a review of the constitution.

By then, moreover, MPCI was no longer the sole rebel group involved in the conflict. While MPCI continued to hold much of the north and the government much of the south, by the end of November, two rebel groups were operating in the west, near the Liberian border: the Movement for Justice and Peace (MJP, &quot;Mouvement pour la justice et la paix&quot;) and the Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (MPIGO, &quot;Mouvement populaire ivoirien du Grand Ouest&quot;). Both groups demanded Gbagbo&#x27;s resignation and revenge for Guéï&#x27;s death. On 28 November, MJP and MPIGO took control of Man, and French troops were drawn into hot conflict for the first time, recapturing the airport in a battle which killed ten rebels and injured one French soldier. On the government side, FPI supporters, led by the Young Patriots (COJEP, &quot;Congrès panafricain des jeunes et des patriotes&quot;), clashed frequently with opposition supporters in violent communal political demonstrations.

By the middle of December 2002, 400 people had died in the conflict and 100,000 more had been displaced. At that time, there were more than 2,500 French troops, including members of the Foreign Legion, in the Ivory Coast; their mission had been enhanced, to include enforcing the 17 October ceasefire by maintaining a buffer zone between rebel forces in the north and government in the south. In December, the rebels regrouped politically, with MJP and MPGIO joined MPCI as junior partners in a new political coalition, the New Forces of Ivory Coast (FNCI, &quot;Forces Nouvelles de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;), led by Guillaume Soro of the MPCI. This merger was viewed as a strategic choice to improve the rebels&#x27; bargaining position ahead of upcoming peace talks. Thereafter, the New Forces administered its northern territories in ten &quot;comzones&quot;, each headed by a zone commander, who was typically a former military officer.

==First round of peace talks==

=== ECOWAS intervention: 18 January 2003 ===
ECOWAS leaders had agreed on 18 December 2002 to deploy an ECOWAS Peace Force for Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, comprising 3,200 military personnel. The force was to arrive before the end of December and take over from France in monitoring the ceasefire. However, its deployment was delayed, and the first contingent of troops did not arrive until 18 January 2003 and consisted of only 172 soldiers. According to the International Peace Institute, the inadequacy of ECOWAS&#x27;s intervention motivated France to lobby in the United Nations (UN) Security Council for a UN peacekeeping operation and, in January 2003, to spearhead peace talks.

=== Linas-Marcoussis talks: 15–26 January 2003 ===
From 15 to 26 January 2003, the various parties – government, rebel forces, and opposition political parties – met at Linas-Marcoussis, near Paris, France, to undertake substantive peace negotiations. The talks were &quot;a French-driven initiative with inputs from regional organizations and the UN&quot;: they were chaired by Pierre Mazeaud, the chairman of the French Constitutional Council, who was assisted by Kéba Mbaye (a Senegalese judge), Seydou Diarra (former Ivorian prime minister and African Union (AU) special envoy), Mohamed Ibn Chambas (the executive secretary of ECOWAS), and Ahmedou Ould Abdallah (the Special Representative for West Africa of the UN Secretary-General). The New Forces had inherited MPCI&#x27;s position in the negotiations: the rebels demanded a fresh election, viewing as illegitimate the results of the 2000 election; while the Ivorian government insisted that Gbagbo should complete his presidential term.

==== Linas-Marcoussis Accord ====
The parties signed a compromise peace agreement, the Linas-Marcoussis Accord, on 26 January. The agreement provided for power-sharing through a Government of National Reconciliation: Gbagbo would remain in office, but Seydou Diarra would be appointed as a non-partisan consensus prime minister, with the understanding that Diarra would not run in the next presidential election. The power-sharing government would include representation for all the agreement&#x27;s signatories: the three major political parties (Bédié&#x27;s PDCI, Ouattara&#x27;s RDR, and Gbagbo&#x27;s FDI), the three major rebel groups in the New Forces (MPCI, MJP, and MPIGO), and four smaller political parties – Movement of the Forces of the Future (&quot;Mouvement des forces de l&#x27;avenir&quot;), Ivorian Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Parti ivoirien des travailleurs&quot;), Citizens&#x27; Democratic Union (&quot;Union démocratique et citoyenne&quot;), and Union for Democracy and Peace in Ivory Coast (&quot;Union pour la démocratie et la paix en Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;). Most controversially, the rebels would control the important ministries of defence and the interior. The ultimate purpose of the Government of National Reconciliation was to allow credible elections to take place in 2005, and the appendix to the agreement outlined a nine-point plan for reforms to be undertaken to this end, including security sector reform, land tenure reform, and – perhaps most importantly – an end to divisive policies on citizenship, national identification, and electoral eligibility. The rebels agreed to disarm in exchange for amnesty and political representation.

The agreement received international backing. On 4 February, the UN Security Council adopted unanimously its first resolution on the Ivorian crisis, calling, in Resolution 1464, for the implementation of the peace agreement, and expressing approval of the French and ECOWAS presence in Ivory Coast. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed Albert Tévoédjrè as his Special Representative in Ivory Coast.
==== &quot;Patriotic&quot; response ====
Inside Ivory Coast, however, FPI and government supporters regarded the Linas-Marcoussis Accord with hostility. Opposition came especially from the military, which rejected New Forces control of the interior and defence ministries and the integration of the rebels into the army. Opposition to the agreement also acquired strong overtones of anti-French sentiment: French neutrality during the early phases of Operation Licorne had already been viewed as suspect, and the Linas-Marcoussis Accord was interpreted, by its Ivorian critics, as providing confirmation that France was attempting to undermine Gbagbo&#x27;s leadership. Gbagbo&#x27;s supporters blamed France for coercing him to accept the agreement. Indeed, in &quot;a clear move to distance himself&quot; from the agreement – which he referred to as a &quot;proposal&quot; – Gbagbo had not signed it, but had sent another representative to sign on FPI&#x27;s behalf.

Immediately after the accord was signed, the Young Patriots organised violent anti-French protests, apparently with Gbagbo&#x27;s backing. A demonstration in Abidjan on 2 February drew 100,000 protesters, who objected to &quot;French occupation&quot; and to the power-sharing deal. The demonstrations continued on a daily basis, and at one point involved an attempt to seize the airport to prevent Diarra from returning to Abidjan to head the new coalition government. Amid attacks on French nationals, businesses, and bases, France carried out another wave of evacuations of French nationals. These protests in early 2003 marked the beginning of a surge in activity by Ivory Coast&#x27;s so-called &quot;patriotic movement&quot;, which continued to depend on mobilisation by the Young Patriots and to receive encouragement from Gbagbo, himself a longstanding nationalist. In the increasingly popular patriotic analysis, the crisis in Ivory Coast was a &quot;war of second independence&quot; from France&#x27;s neocolonial influence, and international intervention in the crisis consisted in an attack on Ivorian sovereignty, particularly insofar as the Linas-Marcoussis Accord was viewed as recognising the legitimacy of the New Forces rebellion and as imposing constitutional change on Ivory Coast. Gbagbo was portrayed as a nationalist pioneer, persecuting for upsetting the status quo of French hegemony. In the months after Linas-Marcoussis, this narrative was used by Gbagbo to deny the legitimacy of international decisions, in favour of reasserting presidential prerogatives, and to justify his reluctance to implement the peace agreement.

== Peace implementation stalled ==

=== Accra II talks: 7–8 March 2003 ===
In a pattern that would be maintained in subsequent years, the signature of the Linas-Marcoussis Accord was followed by significant delays in its implementation, requiring the reopening of peace talks – though the Linas-Marcoussis Accord remained the basic framework within which all such talks took place between 2003 and 2006. On 7–8 March 2003, the first implementation stalemate was temporarily resolved during another summit in Accra, organised by ECOWAS and mediated by Ghanaian President John Kufuor, and therefore intended to mitigate the appearance of French domination of the peace process. The objective of the talks was to revise the power-sharing formula outlined in the Linas-Marcoussis Accord. At Accra II, the parties re-committed to implementing the initial agreement, and, to this end, the New Forces renounced its claims on the defence and interior ministries. Instead, a fifteen-member National Security Council would be established and would agree on candidates to fill those posts.

=== UN intervention: 3 May 2003 ===

The parties signed a comprehensive ceasefire on 3 May, and, the same day, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1479, which established the UN Mission in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (MINUCI, &quot;Mission des Nations unies en Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;) to monitor implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Accord. MINUCI was headed by, and would assist, Tévoédirè, the UN Secretary General&#x27;s Special Representative. MINUCI arrived in Ivory Coast on 27 June 2003; initially comprising 34 officers, it was planned to expand to 76 personnel by the end of the year. Notwithstanding the ceasefire, &quot;extreme violence&quot; continued in the western part of the country, necessitating in late May a joint operation involving elements of both government and rebel forces, as well as French and ECOWAS peacekeepers.

=== End of war declared: 4 July 2003 ===
On 4 July 2003, the government and New Forces announced publicly that the civil war was over, and that they had agreed to work together to implement the peace agreement. However, the violence did not entirely dissipate. In late August, Operation Licorne suffered its first casualties when two French soldiers were killed by rebels near Sakassou. The same week, French intelligence services in Paris arrested 10 people, including Ibrahim Coulibaly, who they said had been plotting to assassinate Gbagbo and destabilise the peace. Moreover, the political conflict raged on. The New Forces refused to begin the demobilisation and disarmament process – or to allow government administrators to return to the north of the country – until Gbagbo had made permanent appointments to the sensitive ministries of defence and the interior. Gbagbo also had not fulfilled his promise to revise electoral eligibility requirements. Progress appeared imminent by September 2003. Ivory Coast reopened its border with Burkina Faso, and the UN downgraded Ivory Coast&#x27;s security rating, reflecting an improvement in conditions. On 13 September, Gbagbo finally made permanent appointments to the defence and interior portfolios. However, he declined to appoint the defence candidate proposed by the National Security Council, retired General Ouassenan Koré. Angered by this unilateral deviation from the Accra II agreement, New Forces representatives announced they would protest the move by suspending their participation in the reconciliation government. They also said that Gbagbo had refused to delegate executive powers to the prime minister and reconciliation government, as stipulated by the Linas-Marcoussis Accord, and warned that the resumption of violence was a real possibility. By the end of 2003, disarmament had not been implemented – in contravention of a 1 October deadline – and military authority in the country remained bifurcated under a &quot;de facto&quot; north-south partition, while inter-ethnic violence continued in the west, particularly between local Guéré and Yacouba. By then, over 700,000 people had been displaced in the conflict.

On 27 February 2004, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1528, authorising the replacement of MINUCI with an ambitious peacekeeping operation, the United Nations Operation in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UNOCI), with a mandate to police the buffer zone between the belligerents. However, in the first half of 2004, events inside Ivory Coast did not bode well for the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Accord, as relations between Ivorian actors continued to deteriorate. In mid-February, Ivorian authorities issued a ministerial decree which would &quot;Ivorianise&quot; workplaces, requiring that companies could only hire foreigners if they submitted a plan to turn the post over to an Ivorian within two years. On 4 March, opposition party PDCI suspended its participation in the reconciliation government, accusing FPI ministers of taking unilateral decisions. On 10 March, one group of Young Patriots stormed the main Ivorian courthouse and physically attacked several magistrates; while another attacked the Hotel du Golf, the residence of the New Forces ministers. The same week, responding to violent demonstrations by students in Daloa, state forces killed one student and wounded 48 others.

=== Peace march: 25 March 2004 ===
On 25 March, opposition parties organised a public demonstration in Abidjan to call on the government to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Accord. In response, the security forces and pro-government militias opened fire on the demonstrators, while other opposition supporters were rounded up by militias in subsequent days. In May, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded an inquiry into the march and aftermath, finding that: at least 120 people were killed, 274 wounded and 20 disappeared. These figures are by no means final... It is equally clear that many of the killings on these two days did not take place in the street but in the dwellings of would-be demonstrators or even innocent civilians targeted by the security forces simply because of their name, origin or community group. It was a well-known fact that police officers or other security officials or parallel forces would harass, try to rob, or search and arrest without warrants people in Abidjan even in the days preceding 25 March. However, these activities had greatly intensified since 23 March and contributed to the explosive environment. Credible accounts received by the Commission indicate that these actions too had been planned and directed by the security forces and later executed in cooperation and collusion with the parallel forces.In protest against the violence, the New Forces and Ouattara&#x27;s RDR announced their withdrawal from the reconciliation government. In May, Gbagbo publicly lambasted the opposition for suspending their participation; shortly afterwards, it was announced that he had sacked (permanently) three opposition ministers: PDCI&#x27;s Patrick Achi, the New Forces&#x27; Youssouff Soumahoro, and Soro, the leader of the New Forces. Soro called the move &quot;tantamount to a coup d&#x27;état against the peace accords&quot;, and said that it would be impossible to establish peace in Ivory Coast until Gbagbo was removed from office.

=== Accra III talks: July 2004 ===
Peace talks resumed in July 2004 in Accra in an attempt to revitalise the peace process. An agreement signed upon the conclusion of the talks once again committed the parties to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Accord, this time &quot;with specific deadlines and benchmarks for progress&quot;. The talks focused on addressing key obstacles to the peace process – notably electoral eligibility, citizenship reform, and the disarmament programme. The rebels agreed to rejoin the reconciliation government, and Gbagbo agreed to revise article 35 of the constitution, which until then had disqualified Ouattara from standing in presidential elections.

However, by October, it was apparent that the Accra III agreement had not broken the implementation deadlock: on 12 October, Gbagbo announced that he would not submit the revised article 35 for National Assembly approval until after the rebels had disarmed; the rebels announced, in response, that they would not disarm until real progress had been made towards credible elections. The New Forces therefore missed the October 15 deadline to begin disarmament, and in early November, as tensions mounted, they formally refused to disarm. By then, the New Forces had imposed a state of emergency in their territories, claiming to have found weaponry hidden in a commercial truck – which they said was a delivery from Gbagbo&#x27;s forces to Soro&#x27;s internal rivals in the north – and warning that &quot;the war isn&#x27;t over yet. It is going to resume shortly&quot;. A sustained assault on the press followed, with newspapers partial to the north being banned and two presses destroyed; dissenting radio stations were silenced.

== Resurgence of violence ==

On 4 November, Gbagbo&#x27;s forces violated the prevailing ceasefire, as the military launched air attacks against rebel positions in Bouaké and Korhogo. The Young Patriots launched another attack on New Forces residences at the Hotel du Golf, expelling Prime Minister Diarra. After the attacks, Soro of the New Forces declared the Linas-Marcoussis Accord and subsequent Accra agreements &quot;null and void&quot;.

===French–Ivorian violence clashes: November 2004===

On 6 November, one or two Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 bombed an Operation Licorne base in Bouaké, killing nine French soldiers and an American aid worker and injuring 31 others, the heaviest casualties suffered by a French operation since the 1983 Beirut barrack bombings. France rejected the Ivorian claim that the bombing had been accidental, and French President Jacques Chirac ordered the retaliatory destruction of both Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 and five MI-24 ground attack helicopters – the entirety of the Ivorian air force&#x27;s fleet. The French–Ivorian clashes which followed represented &quot;a new peak&quot; in the conflict and threatened to derail the peace process entirely, as pro-Gbagbo youths rioted against the French response and looted French-owned businesses, triggering yet another wave of Western evacuations: in two weeks, some 9,000 expatriates left the country. On 7 November, French forces opened fire on rioters in Abidjan, killing between 20 and 60 people according to French and Ivorian estimates respectively.

The clashes strengthened the pro-Gbagbo &quot;patriotic&quot; narrative that the conflict involved a &quot;second war of independence&quot; from France. On 13 November, Mamadou Coulibaly, the President of the Ivorian National Assembly, declared that the government of the Ivory Coast did not take any responsibility for the 6 November bombardment, and announced that the government intended to approach the International Court of Justice to hold France responsible for its destruction of Ivorian air force equipment and for the deaths that the French response had caused. In 2016, a French judicial investigation recommended that three French ministers – Michel Barnier, Dominique de Villepin and Michèle Alliot-Marie – be referred for prosecution for allegedly having obstructed an investigation into the initial Ivorian air raid. In 2021, a Paris court issued life sentences to two Ivorian officers and one Belarusian mercenary, who in absentia had been found guilty of carrying out the air raid.

==Revived peace talks==

The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1572 on 15 November, imposing an immediate arms embargo on Ivory Coast, though the effectiveness of the embargo is debatable. It also authorised targeted sanctions on Ivorian spoilers, and threatened to impose such sanctions if the belligerents did not return to peace negotiations timeously.

=== Pretoria talks: April–June 2005 ===
On 3 to 6 April 2005, South African President Thabo Mbeki chaired peace talks in Pretoria, South Africa, arranged under African Union (AU) auspices with the intention of reviving the peace process. The resulting Pretoria Agreement, intended as a supplement to the Linas-Marcoussis Accord, established a cessation of hostilities and ended the state of war. Mbeki had been involved in the Accra III talks, and, by acknowledging Gbagbo&#x27;s concerns about Ivorian sovereignty, was able to nudge Gbagbo to a deal on sensitive electoral issues – notably the eligibility in elections of all peace talk participants, including Ouattara; and international supervision of the next Ivorian elections. In June, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1603, calling on the UN Secretary-General to prepare to fulfil that supervisory role. Gbagbo also agreed to increase opposition representation on the Independent Electoral Commission and to disband pro-government militias. The New Forces and opposition parties mistrusted Mbeki, viewing him as a biased mediator, but did agree once again to disarm and to rejoin the reconciliation government. Rebel forces started to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line on 21 April, re-establishing the buffer zone, and the parties met in Pretoria again in June 2005 to review and reaffirm the agreement.

=== Further delays: 2005–2006 ===
Nonetheless, and possibly due to intentional delays by Gbagbo, election preparations were slow, even as the end of Gbagbo&#x27;s five-year presidential term – 30 October 2005, according to the constitution – approached. In early September, both the New Forces and the opposition parties said that elections held on 30 October as planned would not be free and fair. In early October, the AU&#x27;s Peace and Security Council conceded that Gbagbo could remain in office for up to 12 months further. Despite objections from the PDCI and RDR, as well as its two smaller partners in the opposition Houphouëtist alliance, the UN Security Council followed suit. On 21 October, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1633, which called for the establishment of an international ministerial working group and mediation group – mandated to draw up a road map for holding elections – and demanded the appointment, by consensus, of a new prime minister in Ivory Coast. Following a delay, both directives were implemented, with Charles Konan Banny appointed the new prime minister in December 2005. On 15 December, the Security Council&#x27;s Resolution 1643 extended the arms embargo and established a new ban against the trade of Ivorian diamonds, marginally affecting the revenues of the New Forces. Although two Young Patriots leaders and one New Forces commander were subject to UN targeted sanctions (a travel ban and asset freezes), the main protagonists avoided such measures; among other factors, discord had emerged in the African regional response, as the AU Peace and Security Council – and South Africa individually – opposed the coercive measures which ECOWAS favoured.

At this stage, the security situation – even around the buffer zone – remained unstable, obstructing UNOCI&#x27;s movement and operations. In mid-January 2006, UN bases in Abidjan, Daloa, Guiglo, and San-Pédro were besieged by thousands of pro-government demonstrators, after the Young Patriots took over the Ivorian state-run radio and television stations and sent out a call for civilians to attack UNOCI and the French. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that four people had died in the clashes. In early November 2006, the UN Security Council agreed to delay elections further, extending Gbagbo and Banny&#x27;s terms for another &quot;new and final&quot; transition period of one year. Resolution 1721, lobbied for by France, also strengthened the powers of Prime Minister Banny, leading Gbagbo to warn that he would not carry out UN directives which were inconsistent with the Ivorian constitution.During this period, the Ivorian national football team was credited with boosting national reconciliation. In 2007, the team qualified for the 2008 African Cup of Nations in a game held in rebel-held Bouaké and attended by troops from both sides; similarly, in October 2005, the team&#x27;s qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup sparked days of public celebration in Abidjan, and on some accounts was responsible for persuading the government and rebels to recommit to peace negotiations.

=== Ouagadougou talks: 2006–2007 ===
Shortly after the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1721, Gbagbo announced that he was preparing his own &quot;new framework&quot; to resolve the crisis, reflecting that, &quot;Confronted by the failure of external solutions, it is time for Ivorians to assume total ownership of the peace process&quot;. The new framework revolved around &quot;direct dialogue&quot; between the New Forces and Gbagbo&#x27;s FPI, to be undertaken bilaterally without international mediation. Bilateral pre-negotiations had in fact been underway in secret since mid-2006.

Although touted as a &quot;home-grown&quot; solution, the talks were facilitated by Burkinabé President Blaise Compaoré, with ECOWAS&#x27;s endorsement, and Mbeki had also been involved in the pre-negotiations. None of the opposition parties were invited to participate, and Gbagbo and Soro held direct talks alone for the first time.

==== Ouagadougou Peace Agreement ====

On 4 March 2007, the parties – the FPI government and the New Forces – signed the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, their eighth peace agreement since 2002. The agreement, which represented a comprehensive political settlement to the conflict, entailed a new power-sharing arrangement, abandoning the notion of a consensus prime minister: instead, Soro was to become prime minister (thus marginalising opposition leaders Ouattara and Bédié) – but Gbagbo&#x27;s constitutional prerogatives as president were also to be re-established. The agreement also implied a reduce role for international supervision: several international monitoring mechanisms agreed to after the Pretoria talks (including the establishment of a UN High Representative for the Election in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) were eliminated, although the UN Secretary General&#x27;s Special Representative retained the right to certify the electoral process. The agreement included mechanisms to expedite voter registration and identification so that a presidential election could be held in ten months. It also included provisions for the disarmament of combatants and, through a joint command centre, for the restructuring of the military and security forces.

==== Implementation ====
Soro took office in early April, and formed a cabinet that retained many of the ministers who had served under his predecessor. On 16 April, Gbagbo declared that the war was over, as he, with Soro, presided over the first steps to dismantle the UNOCI buffer zone, an occasion celebrated by a joint parade of government and New Forces troops. On 18 June, the central government began its administrative redeployment in northern areas formerly held by rebels, with the first new prefect installed in Bouaké. Despite a fatal rocket attack on Soro&#x27;s airplane on 30 June, the reconciliation process continued with the large &quot;Peace Flame&quot; disarmament ceremony on 30 July, in which the two leaders set fire to a pile of weapons, symbolising the end of the conflict. The ceremony also involved Gbagbo&#x27;s first visit, since 2002, to the former rebel stronghold of Bouaké.

On 27 November, Gbagbo and Soro met with Compaoré in Ouagadougou to discuss the implementation of the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement and set a deadline for elections. In late December, they met again, this time in Tiébissou to preside over the beginning of a nation-wide disarmament process, scheduled to unfold over three months as troops from both sides left the front and returned to barracks. When the buffer zone was fully dismantled in July 2008, it was replaced by a &quot;green line&quot; of international peacekeepers, split across seventeen observation points, who would gradually be replaced by joint Ivorian patrols including both New Forces and government troops. Disarmament and demobilisation encountered several hurdles. Opposition politicians Ouattara and Bédié expressed opposition to the sequencing of disarmament, suggesting that elections should take place first, while there were occasional riots by contingents of ex-rebels who demanded payment (or augmentation) of the demobilisation payments they had been promised by the new government. France, Japan, and the United States announced in May 2009 that they would make funds available to cover the election costs and the costs of the disarmament payments.

Preparations for the presidential election began in 2007, with Sagem, a French company, hired to administer the voters&#x27; roll; but, in October 2008, the New Forces suggested postponing the election for no more than a year, in order to provide more time for voter registration. In early November 2008, several Ivorian parties – including Gbagbo, Soro, Bédié, and Ouattara – met in Ouagadougou and agreed to postpone; the UN Security Council called for elections to be held no later than mid-2009. Despite an announcement in May 2009 that the election would be held on November 29, it did not take place until October 2010.

== Impact ==
According to 2009 estimates by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, in its deadliest years between 2002 and 2004, the war had between 933 and 1,689 casualties, with a best guess of 1,265 casualties. UNOCI suffered 36 casualties during the war: fifteen in 2005, thirteen in 2006, and eight in 2007. According to the UN Refugee Agency, approximately 750,000 people were forcibly displaced between 2002 and 2007, including 50,000 refugees who fled primarily to Liberia, Guinea, and Mali.

==Aftermath: Return to war==
Ivory Coast held its first presidential elections since 2000 in October 2010, but a dispute over the result led to renewed political crisis and to the beginning of the Second Ivorian Civil War. Soro did not run in the election, nor did the New Forces endorse a candidate. The Independent Electoral Commission declared Ouattara the winner, a result endorsed by international observers, but was contradicted in this respect by the Constitutional Council; both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential oath of office. Hundreds of people were killed in the violence that followed, and hundreds of thousands were displaced. UN Security Council Resolution 1962 extended UNOCI&#x27;s mandate and called on all parties to recognise Ouattara as Ivory Coast&#x27;s rightful president. The second civil war ended with Gbagbo&#x27;s defeat and arrest in April 2011, but, despite its brevity, had a higher death toll than the first: a 2012 national commission of inquiry recorded 3,248 fatalities.

<text>A  () is a living street, as originally implemented in the Netherlands and subsequently in Flanders (Belgium). Techniques include shared space, traffic calming, and low speed limits. 

The term has been adopted directly by some English-language publications. In the United Kingdom, these areas are called home zones.

==Etymology==
The word, of Dutch origin, literally translates as or .

==History==

Since the invention of automobiles, cities have been predominantly constructed to accommodate the use of automobiles.

The &quot;woonerf&quot; was created by residents of Delft who tore up pavement late at night to make it so cars had to drive slower to avoid the obstacles. The &quot;woonerven&quot; (plural) was incorporated into the national street design standards in 1976.

The entire locality of Emmen in the Netherlands was designed as a in the 1970s.

In 1999 the Netherlands had over 6000 and today around 2 million Dutch people are living in &quot;woonerven&quot;. The benefits of the are promoted by , a network of professionals and residents.

In 2006 it was reported that people in Hesselterbrink, a neighborhood of Emmen, were disillusioned about how the principle had become another traffic engineering measure that &quot;entailed precious little more than signs and uniform standards&quot;. They have now adopted the shared space principles as a way of rethinking the . They are reported to &quot;now know that car drivers should become residents. Eye contact and human interaction are more effective means to achieve and maintain attractive and safe areas than signs and rules&quot;.
==Regulation==

=== Belgium ===

Belgian traffic regulation (art. 2.32) defines the and the generic erf, and their traffic sign. The has a residential focus; the erf can have other primary uses like “crafts, trade, tourism, education and recreation”.

In art. 22bis, the Belgian traffic regulation describes what is and what isn’t allowed in a (woon)erf:

=== Netherlands ===
Under Article 44 of the Dutch traffic code, motorised traffic in a or &quot;recreation area&quot; is restricted to 15 km/h in the Netherlands.

<text>Ketel One is a vodka brand of the Nolet Distillery in Schiedam, Netherlands. Ketel One Vodka is distilled from 100% wheat in copper pot stills (Ketel is Dutch for &quot;pot still&quot;), filtered over loose charcoal, and rests in tile-lined tanks until ready. Ketel One Vodka is named after the original copper pot still, &quot;Distilleerketel #1.&quot; The alcohol content of this spirit is 40% (80 proof (US), 70 degrees proof (international)). The Nolet Distillery also makes Ketel One Citroen, Ketel One Oranje, Ketel One Botanical (in the varietals Peach &amp; Orange Blossom, Cucumber &amp; Mint, and Grapefruit Rose) and Ketel 1 Jenever.

== History ==
=== 17th century ===
Ketel One is produced by the Nolet Distillery in Schiedam, Netherlands. The Nolet Distillery was founded in 1691 by the Nolet family, French Huguenot refugees, and has remained in the Nolet family ever since. Ketel One is so named for the original coal-fired copper still that was used to distill it, Distilleerketel #1.

=== 18th century ===
In 1794, a windmill known as &quot;the Whale&quot; was built on the property. In 1867 the family began to focus on exporting their products.

=== 19th century ===

The town of Schiedam has long been known for the alcohol industry. By the end of the 19th century the town boasted over 400 distilleries. 

=== 20th century ===

The Nolet Family opened a distillery in the United States in 1902 and sold vodka under the Imperial Eagle Vodka brand name. Nolet were forced to close it during the prohibition era, with Joannes Nolet forced to flee the country.

The distillery industry in Schiedam was hit hard by World War II, and by the end of the war only 40 distilleries were left. Within the next few years changes in technology and consolidations and mergers left Nolet as the only distillery still operating in Schiedam.

When Carolus Nolet (1941–), the tenth generation of the family to own the company, took over for his father in 1979, the company made a wide range of spirits. He made the decision to focus on one product, and make it the best it could be. The company began producing jenever exclusively. Ketel 1 Jenever quickly became the best selling Jenever brand in the Netherlands. At that point the company began to look at returning to the United States market. Carolus began to develop a vodka designed specially for the American market, focusing on quality.

Nolet returned to the U.S. market in 1983, launching Ketel One Vodka in San Francisco at the BIX Restaurant and Supper Club. Rather than advertising directly to consumers, the company encouraged bartenders and distributors to sell their product. In 1991 Carl Nolet Jr. moved to the U.S. and founded Nolet Spirits USA. Between 2000 and 2010 the company released two flavored vodkas, Ketel One Citroen and Ketel One Oranje.

Sales of Ketel One increased from 7,000 cases in 1992–1993 to 250,000 cases worldwide in 1997.

=== 21st century ===

Ketel One reached sales of one million cases worldwide in 2002. In 2003 the company launched its first advertising campaign, thanking Ketel One drinkers. By 2008 the company was selling close to two million cases per year.

In 2008, Diageo announced an investment of $900 million in a joint venture with the owners of Ketel One, with the Nolet family continuing ownership of the distillery in Schiedam.

In 2009 the brand attracted attention for its first television commercials, which seemed &quot;tailor-made&quot; for the post-2008 recession economy. Despite being sold in 25 countries, up until 2008 the United States was the only country where the company advertised.

In 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index as having the Ketel One brand at number 2, behind only Grey Goose among vodkas.

<text>Oscar James Dunn (1822 – November 22, 1871) served as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana during the era of Reconstruction and was the first African American to act as lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. 

In 1868, Dunn was elected lieutenant governor of Louisiana, thus becoming the first African-American lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. He ran on the ticket headed by Henry Clay Warmoth, formerly of Illinois. In 1871, he became the first African-American acting governor of a U.S. state after Governor Warmoth injured his foot and left Louisiana to recuperate on two occasions. Article 53 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1868 required the lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor &quot;in case of impeachment of the Governor, his removal from office, death...resignation or absence from the state.&quot; Dunn served as acting governor of Louisiana for a total of 39 days. Dunn died in office, and the state legislature elected state Senator P. B. S. Pinchback, another African American Republican, to replace him as lieutenant governor. A year later, Pinchback became acting governor for his own 34-day interim stint.

== Early life ==
In approximately 1822, Dunn was born into slavery in New Orleans. His mother, Maria Dunn, was enslaved under the law of the time. He received her status and was also enslaved. His father, James Dunn, had been freed in 1819 by his owner. James Dunn was born into slavery in Petersburg, Virginia and had been transported to the Deep South during the forced migration of more than one million African Americans from the Upper South. He was bought by James H. Caldwell of New Orleans, who founded the St. Charles Theatre and New Orleans Gas Light Company. Dunn worked for Caldwell as a skilled carpenter for decades, including after his emancipation by Caldwell in 1819.

After being emancipated, Dunn married Maria, then enslaved, and they had two children, Oscar and Jane. Slave marriages were not recognized under the law. By 1832, Dunn had earned enough money as a carpenter to purchase the freedom of his wife and both children. Their status as free blacks was gained decades before the American Civil War. As English speakers, they were not, however, part of the culture of free people of color in Louisiana, who were primarily of French descent and culture and of the Catholic religion.

James Dunn continued to work as a carpenter for his former master Caldwell. His wife, Maria Dunn, ran a boarding house for actors and actresses who were in the city to perform at the Caldwell theatres. Together, they were able to pay for education for their children. Having studied music, Dunn became both an accomplished musician and an instructor of the violin.

Oscar Dunn was apprenticed as a young man to a plastering and painting contractor, A. G. Wilson. Wilson verified Dunn&#x27;s free status in the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Register of Free People of Color 1840–1864&quot;. On November 23, 1841, the contractor reported Dunn as a runaway in a newspaper ad in the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;. However, Dunn must have returned to work because he progressed in the world.

Dunn was an English-speaking free black in a city in which the racial caste system was the underpinning of daily life. Ethnic French, including many free people of color, believed their culture was more subtle and flexible than that brought by the English-speaking residents, who came to the city in the early-to-mid-19th century after the Louisiana Purchase and began to dominate it in number. Free people of color had been established as a separate class of merchants, artisans and property owners, many of whom had educations. However, American migrants from the South dismissed their special status, classifying society in binary terms, as black or white, despite a long history of interracial relations in their own history.

===Freemasonry===
Dunn joined Prince Hall Richmond Lodge #4, one of a number of fraternal organizations that expanded to New Orleans, out of the Prince Hall Ohio Lodge during the 19th century. In the latter half of the 1850s, he rose to Master and Grand Master of the Eureka Grand Lodge which became the Louisiana Grand Lodge [Prince Hall/York Rite]. Author and historian, Joseph A. Walkes Jr., a Prince Hall Freemason, credits Dunn with outstanding conduct of Masonic affairs in Louisiana. As a Freemason, Dunn developed his leadership skills, and he established a wide network and power base in the black community that was essential for his later political career.

===Marriage and family===
In December 1866, Dunn married Ellen Boyd Marchand, a widow born free in Ohio. She was the daughter of Henry Boyd and his wife, who were from Ohio. He adopted her three children, Fannie (9), Charles (7) and Emma (5). The couple did not have children together. In 1870, the Dunn family residence was on Canal Street, one block west of South Claiborne Avenue and within walking distance of Straight University and the St. James A.M.E. Church complex, where they were members.

Dunn worked to achieve equality for the millions of blacks freed by passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified after the American Civil War. He actively promoted and supported the Universal Suffrage Movement, advocated land ownership for all blacks, taxpayer-funded education of all black children, and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. He joined the Republican Party, many of whose members supported suffrage for blacks.

Dunn opened an employment agency that assisted in finding jobs for the freedmen. He was appointed as Secretary of the Advisory Committee of the Freedmen&#x27;s Savings and Trust Company of New Orleans, established by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. As the city and region struggled to convert to a free labor system, Dunn worked to ensure that recently freed slaves were treated fairly by former planters, who insisted on hiring by year-long contracts. In 1866, he organized the People&#x27;s Bakery, an enterprise owned and operated by the Louisiana Association of Workingmen.

Elected to the New Orleans city council in 1867, Dunn was named chairman of a committee to review Article 5 of the City Charter. He proposed that &quot;all children between the ages of 6–18 be eligible to attend public schools and that the Board of Aldermen shall provide for the education of all children ... without distinction to color.&quot; In the state Constitutional Convention of 1867–1868, the resolution was enacted into Louisiana law and laid the foundation for the public education system, established for the first time in the state by the biracial legislature. Dunn&#x27;s biographer (and descendant) Brian K. Mitchell observed in a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; interview, &quot;The reason he wanted to integrate schools is he believed that it&#x27;s hard to change adults&#x27; minds, but if we have children growing up experiencing each other, we can erode racism in this country.&quot;

Dunn was very active in local, state and federal politics, with connections to U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and U.S. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Long before President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington, President Ulysses S. Grant met him at the White House on April 2, 1869.

Running for lieutenant governor, he defeated a white candidate — W. Jasper Blackburn, the former mayor of Minden in Webster Parish — for the nomination by a vote of 54 to 27. The Warmoth-Dunn Republican ticket was elected, 64,941 to 38,046: That was considered the rise of the Radical Republican influence in state politics. Dunn was inaugurated lieutenant governor on June 13, 1868. He was also the President pro tempore of the Louisiana State Senate. He was a member of the Printing Committee of the legislature, which controlled a million-dollar budget. He also served as President of the Metropolitan Police, which had an annual budget of nearly one million dollars. It struggled to maintain peace in a volatile political atmosphere, especially after the New Orleans Riot of 1866. In 1870, Dunn served on the board of trustees and Examining Committee for Straight University, a historically black college founded in the city.

The Republicans developed severe internal conflicts. Although elected with Warmoth, as the governor worked toward Fusionist goals, Dunn became allied with the Custom House faction, which was led by Stephen B. Packard and tied in with federal patronage jobs. They had differences with the Warmoth-Pinchback faction, and challenged it for leadership of the party. Warmoth had been criticized for appointing white Democrats to state positions, encouraging alliances with Democrats, and his failure to advance civil rights for blacks. William Pitt Kellogg, whom Warmoth had helped gain election as U.S. Senator in 1868, also allied with Packard and was later elected as governor of the state.

Because of Dunn&#x27;s wide connections and influence in the city, his defection to the Custom House faction meant that he would take many Republican ward clubs with him in switching allegiance, especially those made up of African Americans rather than Afro-Creoles (the mixed-race elite that had been established as free before the war). For the Radical Republicans, the city was always more important to their political power than were the rural parishes.

Dunn made numerous political enemies during this period. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dunn &quot;had difficulties with Harry Lott&quot;, a Rapides Parish member of the Louisiana House of Representatives (1868–1870, 1870–1872). He also had differences with his eventual successor as lieutenant governor, State Senator P.B.S. Pinchback over policy, leadership, and direction.

===Death===
On November 22, 1871, Dunn died at home, at age 49, after a brief and sudden illness. He had been campaigning for the upcoming state and presidential elections. There was speculation that he was poisoned by political enemies, but no evidence was found. According to Nick Weldon at the Historic New Orleans Collection, Dunn&#x27;s symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning: vomiting and shivering. Only four out of the seven doctors who examined Dunn signed off on the official cause of death, suspecting murder. No confirmation was made because Dunn&#x27;s family had refused an autopsy.

The Dunn funeral was reported as one of the largest in New Orleans. As many as 50,000 people lined Canal Street for the procession, and newspapers across the nation reported the event. State officials, Masonic lodges and civic and social organizations participated in the procession from the St. James A.M.E. church to his grave site. He was interred in the Cassanave family mausoleum at St. Louis Cemetery No. 2.

==Honors==
W.E.B. Du Bois, leading civil rights activist, later called Dunn &quot;an unselfish, incorruptible leader.&quot;

The Washington Artillery Park in New Orleans was renamed in honor of Oscar Dunn.

The &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; published a poem the day after Dunn&#x27;s death in his honor, entitled &quot;The Death Struggle&quot;:

==Survivors==
After his death, his widow, Ellen, was appointed by the mayor of New Orleans to the position of municipal archives director. Several years later, on November 23, 1875, she married J. Henri Burch. A former state senator from East Baton Rouge Parish, Burch had been an ally of her late husband&#x27;s, as part of the Custom House faction. The Burch family resided in New Orleans and continued there after the withdrawal of federal troops and the end of Reconstruction, in 1877.

<text>CSS &quot;Palmetto State&quot; was one of six casemate ironclad rams built for the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. Completed in 1862, she defended Charleston, South Carolina and was burnt in 1865 to prevent her capture by advancing Union troops.

==Background and description==

The ship was built to a design by the Chief Naval Constructor, John L. Porter, based on his earlier work on the ironclad , retaining the traditional curving ship-type hull, but with flat ends to the casemate. As usual for Confederate ships, dimensions vary slightly between sources. The plan showed an overall length of and a length between perpendiculars of with a maximum beam of , a moulded beam of and a depth of hold of . The ship&#x27;s draft was 12 feet, although Canney says that &quot;Palmetto State&quot; drew of water. She was fitted with a hatch for the pilot above the steering wheel for ease in issuing orders to the helmsman and engine room abaft the funnel even though it blocked the pilot&#x27;s forward vision.

The propulsion systems of the &quot;Richmond&quot;-class ironclads were different for each of the ships, often depending on what could be sourced locally. &quot;Palmetto State&quot;″s pair of single-cylinder, direct-acting steam engines were taken from the gunboat serving in Charleston. They used steam provided by a pair of horizontal fire-tube boilers built by the locally based Cameron &amp; Company to drive a propeller. The boilers were probably tall, long, and wide. The ironclad had a speed of and a crew of 120.

&quot;Palmetto State&quot; was initially armed with one Brooke rifle on a pivot mount at the bow, a Brooke rifle on a pivot mount in the stern, with two muzzle-loading smoothbore guns on the broadside. The ship was later equipped with a spar torpedo on her bow in 1863. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships merely states that her armament consisted of two rifled guns and two smoothbore guns. Naval historian Raimondo Luraghi states that the ship was armed with two Brooke rifles and two smoothbores, Naval historian Donald Canney says that a January 1865 report shows the ship equipped with ten 7-inch Brooke rifles, four on each broadside and one each in the bow and stern. He does not believe that it is accurate because the addition of so many additional guns would require rebuilding the casemate and would strain the ship&#x27;s hull with so much extra weight.

Her casemate armor was thick, backed by of wood, while of iron armor was used everywhere else.

==Construction and career==

Named for the nickname of South Carolina, &quot;Palmetto State&quot; was laid down in January 1862 by Cameron &amp; Company at their shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.

Before dawn on 31 January 1863 &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and her sister ship crept through thick haze to surprise the Union blockading force off Charleston. Taking full advantage of her low silhouette in the darkness, the ironclad steamed in under the guns of the Union gunboat , ramming as well as firing heavy shot point-blank into her hull. Completely disabled, with cannons that could not be depressed low enough to fire at &quot;Palmetto State&quot;, the Union ship was forced to surrender. The ram then turned her attention to , firing several shells into the blockader. Her steam chests punctured, &quot;Keystone State&quot; lost all power and had to be towed to safety. A long-range cannon duel between the Confederate rams and other Union blockaders then took place, but little damage was inflicted by either side before &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and &quot;Chicora&quot; withdrew to safety within Charleston Harbor. The attack by the Confederate rams caused the temporary withdrawal of the blockaders from their inshore positions and led to the claim by the Confederate government, unsuccessfully advanced, that the blockade of Charleston had been broken.

&quot;Palmetto State&quot; also joined in the defense of Charleston during Admiral Samuel Francis du Pont&#x27;s unsuccessful 1–7 April 1863 attack on the harbor forts. Her officers and men were cited for rendering valuable services on the night of 6–7 September 1863 during the removal troops from Fort Wagner and Battery Gregg.

&quot;Palmetto State&quot; was later set afire by the Confederates to avoid capture upon the evacuation of Charleston on 18 February 1865.

<doc id="1173531" wikidata="Q5252775" url="?curid=1173531" title="Deke (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, a deke is a type of feint or fake technique whereby a player draws an opposing player out of position or skates by the opponent while maintaining possession and control of the puck. The term is a Canadianism formed by abbreviating the word &quot;decoy&quot;.

The position of the player performing the deke and the defender determines where the puck will be moved and the speed. The deke can be used to move the puck out of reach of an opposing player, move the puck past the opposing player, or quickly change direction of the puck so the opposing player is caught out of position. Dekes are usually used in combination with either a change of direction or speed, or both; the deke may refer to the entire sequence of actions as well as the maneuver(s) made with the stick. Often a change in direction or a change in speed is enough to get past an opposing player, but dekes are used in combination with these to better protect the puck and get by a defender.

==Types==
One type is the &quot;head fake&quot;, using a movement of the head to fool an opposing player over the player&#x27;s movements or intention.

===Toe drag===
A more complex deke is the &quot;toe drag&quot;, a deke in which the puck carrier brings the puck forward on their forehand, and subsequently turns their stick and pulls the puck towards themselves with the toe of the blade, while moving past the defender, who has presumably attempted to poke check the puck in its previous position.

==Recreational rules==

In recreational hockey in Canada, including ice hockey but also especially floor hockey and street hockey where penalty shots are often awarded in cases of fouls for which timed penalties would be assessed at competitive levels, penalty shooters are often expected to declare whether they intend to &quot;shoot or deke&quot; prior to attempting the shot. Should the offensive player wish to &quot;shoot,&quot; (s)he is expected to shoot the puck/ball on goal from the spot it is placed, which in a recreational game is often less than thirty feet from the goal. Should the offensive player wish to &quot;deke,&quot; the goaltender is usually permitted to leave his or her crease from the moment the puck/ball is touched to attempt to prevent the offensive player from scoring.

<text>Châtenay-Malabry () is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris. It is located from the center of Paris.

The French writer Chateaubriand lived in the estate at Châtenay-Malabry. The Garden City in the Butte Rouge, the , is one of the earliest examples of housing at moderated rents ().

Châtenay was the location of , of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Paris-Sud and is the location of French national laboratory of doping detection. It is also the home of the Arboretum de la Vallée-aux-Loups. The high-speed LGV Atlantique crosses the city through a tunnel covered by a park called (greenway).

From 31 December 2002, it was part of the Agglomeration community of Hauts de Bièvre, which merged into the in January 2016.

==Geography==

Châtenay-Malabry is situated near the Parc de Sceaux.

It borders the department of Essonne which borders the department of Yvelines. Châtenay-Malabry is demarcated by the communes of Sceaux, Antony, Bièvres, Plessis-Robinson and Verrières-le-Buisson.

A highly wooded area, it can be crossed by the , which includes part of Via Turonesis which is one of the routes through France on the pilgrimage to the tomb of St. James the Great. As for the North and South entrances, they are, to say the least, a part of the urban fabric of the town.

The two main entrances to the town are located west and east of the Division Leclerc avenue, which is the main road of the town. In the direction of Verrières Forest is a large roundabout which appears as a clearing in the forest before diving into the urban landscape. In the direction of Antony is a simple roundabout located at the southeast corner of the Sceaux Park.

==History==
Originally simply called Châtenay, the name of the commune officially became Châtenay-Malabry in 1920.

The name &quot;Châtenay&quot; comes from &quot;castellanum&quot; = &quot;petit château&quot; (little castle) and &quot;Malabry&quot; comes from a deformation of &quot;badly located&quot;, &quot;spoiled ground&quot;.

==Transportation==
Châtenay-Malabry is served by Robinson station on Paris RER line B. This station is located at the border between the commune of Châtenay-Malabry and the commune of Sceaux, on the Sceaux side of the border.

<doc id="1173539" wikidata="Q1330121" url="?curid=1173539" title="First pass effect">
<text>The first pass effect (also known as first-pass metabolism or presystemic metabolism) is a phenomenon of drug metabolism at a specific location in the body which leads to a reduction in the concentration of the active drug before it reaches the site of action or systemic circulation. The effect is most associated with orally administered medications, but some drugs still undergo first-pass metabolism even when delivered via an alternate route (e.g., IV, IM, etc.). During this metabolism, drug is lost during the process of absorption which is generally related to the liver and gut wall. The liver is the major site of first pass effect; however, it can also occur in the lungs, vasculature or other metabolically active tissues in the body. 

Notable drugs that experience a significant first pass effect are buprenorphine, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, diazepam, ethanol (drinking alcohol), imipramine, insulin, lidocaine, midazolam, morphine, pethidine, propranolol, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 

First-pass metabolism is not to be confused with phase I metabolism, which is a separate process.

== Factors ==
First-pass metabolism may occur in the liver (for propranolol, lidocaine, clomethiazole, and nitroglycerin) or in the gut (for benzylpenicillin and insulin). The four primary systems that affect the first pass effect of a drug are the enzymes of the gastrointestinal lumen, gastrointestinal wall enzymes, bacterial enzymes and hepatic enzymes.

== Hepatic first-pass ==
After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic portal system. It is carried through the portal vein into the liver before it reaches the rest of the body. The liver metabolizes many drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from the liver to the rest of the circulatory system. This &quot;first pass&quot; through the liver thus may greatly reduce the bioavailability of the drug.

An example of a drug where first-pass metabolism is a complication and disadvantage is in the antiviral drug remdesivir. Remdesivir cannot be administered orally because the entire dose would be trapped in the liver with little achieving systemic circulation or reaching target organs and cells (for example, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2). For this reason, remdesivir is administered by IV infusion, bypassing the portal vein. However, significant hepatic extraction still occurs because of second pass metabolism, whereby a fraction of venous blood travels through the hepatic portal vein and hepatocytes.

== Drug design ==
In drug design, drug candidates may have good druglikeness but fail on first-pass metabolism because it is biochemically selective. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) are used to predict first-pass metabolism, although they require compound-specific adjustments due to variability in intestinal mucosal permeability and other factors. Enzyme expression also varies between individuals, which may influence the efficiency of first-pass metabolism and thus the bioavailability of the drug.

Cytochromes P450, especially CYP3A4, play a crucial role in first-pass metabolism, affecting the bioavailability of drugs.

== Mitigation ==
Converting a drug into a prodrug can help avoid first-pass metabolism, thereby improving its bioavailability. In vitro models, such as the use of microfluidic chips that simulate the gut and liver, allow first-pass metabolism to be studied more accurately, facilitating the development of drugs with better absorption profiles.

=== Routes of administration ===
Alternative routes of administration, such as insufflation, rectal administration, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol, transdermal, or sublingual, avoid or partially avoid the first pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation.

Drugs with high first pass effect typically have a considerably higher oral dose than sublingual or parenteral dose. There is marked individual variation in the oral dose due to differences in the extent of first-pass metabolism, frequently among several other factors. Oral bioavailability of many vulnerable drugs appears to be increased in patients with compromised liver function. Bioavailability is also increased if another drug competing for first-pass metabolism enzymes is given concurrently (e.g., propranolol and chlorpromazine).

<doc id="1173541" wikidata="Q145229" url="?curid=1173541" title="Runlevel">
<text>A runlevel is a mode of operation in the computer operating systems that implements Unix System V-style initialization. Conventionally, seven runlevels exist, numbered from zero to six. &quot;S&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for one of the levels. Only one runlevel is executed on startup; run levels are not executed one after another (i.e. only runlevel 2, 3, or 4 is executed, not more of them sequentially or in any other order).

A runlevel defines the state of the machine after boot. Different runlevels are typically assigned (not necessarily in any particular order) to the single-user mode, multi-user mode without network services started, multi-user mode with network services started, system shutdown, and system reboot system states. The exact setup of these configurations varies between operating systems and Linux distributions. For example, runlevel 4 might be a multi-user GUI no-server configuration on one distribution, and nothing on another. Runlevels commonly follow the general patterns described in this article; however, some distributions employ certain specific configurations.

In standard practice, when a computer enters runlevel zero, it shuts off, and when it enters runlevel six, it reboots. The intermediate runlevels (1–5) differ in terms of which drives are mounted and which network services are started. Default runlevels are typically 3, 4, or 5. Lower runlevels are useful for maintenance or emergency repairs, since they usually offer no network services at all. The particular details of runlevel configuration differ widely among operating systems, and also among system administrators.

In various Linux distributions, the traditional script used in the Version 7 Unix was first replaced by runlevels and then by systemd states on most major distributions.

== Standard runlevels ==
== Linux ==
Although systemd is, , used by default in most major Linux distributions, runlevels can still be used through the means provided by the sysvinit project. After the Linux kernel has booted, the program reads the file to determine the behavior for each runlevel. Unless the user specifies another value as a kernel boot parameter, the system will attempt to enter (start) the default runlevel.

=== Linux Standard Base specification ===
Systems conforming to the Linux Standard Base (LSB) need not provide the exact run levels given here or give them the meanings described here, and may map any level described here to a different level which provides the equivalent functionality.

=== Slackware Linux ===
Slackware Linux uses runlevel 1 for maintenance, as on other Linux distributions; runlevels 2, 3 and 5 identically configured for a console (with all services active); and runlevel 4 adds the X Window System.

=== Gentoo Linux ===
=== Debian GNU/Linux ===
== Unix ==

=== System V Releases 3 and 4 ===
=== Solaris ===
Starting from Solaris 10, SMF (Service Management Facility) is used instead of SVR4 run levels. The latter are emulated to preserve compatibility with legacy startup scripts.

=== HP-UX ===
=== AIX ===
AIX does not follow the System V R4 (SVR4) runlevel specification, with runlevels from 0 to 9 available, as well as from a to c (or h). 0 and 1 are reserved, 2 is the default normal multi-user mode and runlevels from 3 to 9 are free to be defined by the administrator. Runlevels from a to c (or h) allow the execution of processes in that runlevel without killing processes started in another.

The S, s, M and m runlevels are not true runlevels, but are used to tell the init command to enter maintenance mode. When the system enters maintenance mode from another runlevel, only the system console is used as the terminal.

<doc id="1173542" wikidata="Q3407608" url="?curid=1173542" title="Lake Pupuke">
<text>Lake Pupuke (traditionally known in Māori as Pupukemoana) is a heart-shaped freshwater lake occupying a volcanic crater (or maar) between the suburbs of Takapuna and Milford on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand. The heart shape is a result of its formation by the linking of two circular craters – a larger one forming most of the lake and a smaller one forming the arm in the northeast. Separated from the sea by less than 200 m at one point, it has a circumference of about 4.5 km and reaches 57 m in depth. It is popular for recreational activities and the lakefront property around it.

==Geology==
Lake Pupuke is one of the oldest known features of the Auckland volcanic field, erupting an estimated 193,200 years ago.

Other similar craters in the Auckland volcanic field were either buried by later eruptions, or breached by erosion as rainwater collected and overflowed the edge of the crater. Lake Pupuke remains a lake because, unlike the other vents, its eruptions produced substantial lava flows; water can thus escape through cracks in the lava reaching under the crater wall, creating a series of freshwater springs along the beaches between Takapuna and Milford. The lava flow at the end of Takapuna Beach enveloped a kauri forest, producing an internationally significant collection of tree moulds, which has been called &quot;New Zealand’s only example of a fossil forest preserved in a lava flow&quot; and which &quot;ranks among the best examples in the world.&quot; Some moulds have escaped burial by the boat ramp and car park built on top of the lava, and can be viewed at low tide.

A small scoria cone existed to the west of Lake Pupuke, which was quarried during European settlement.

==History==

In 1894, a pump house was built on the shore of the lake to supply fresh water to the local area. This was replaced in 1906 by a second pump house. As a result of increasing demand, the water level of the lake fell and water quality decreased. The use of the lake as a fresh water supply was discontinued in 1944 when new supplies were sourced from reservoirs in the Waitākere Ranges. The second pump house has become a Category II protected building under the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 1983. The building is now home to The PumpHouse Theatre with three performance spaces including an outdoor amphitheatre.

&quot;Vallisneria&quot; plants were introduced to the lake, and dominates much of the lake floor.

==Māori mythology==
A Māori myth surrounding the lake tells of a tupua couple, children of the fire gods. After quarreling and cursing Mahuika, the fire-goddess, their home on the mainland was destroyed by Matahoe, god of earthquakes and eruptions, on Mahuika&#x27;s behalf. Lake Pupuke resulted from the destruction, while Rangitoto Island rose from the sea as their exile. The mists surrounding Rangitoto at certain times are considered the tears of the tupua couple for their former home.

==Human use==
Close to the Takapuna city centre, the lake is popular not only with wild birds (such as shags) but with picnickers, paddlers, kayakers, rowers, yachtsmen, divers, and windsurfers (lessons have been given on the lake). Free divers (no tanks) have practiced in the lake. College rowing crews use it. There have been boating races. and the Pupuke Boating Club operates there. Takapuna Boating Club hosts regattas.

The Auckland Dragon Boat Association runs an annual regionals race event on the lake, with 200m, 500m and 2 km races. The lake is the venue for Dragon Boat, Canoe sprints, Canoe marathon, and Waka Ama sprint racing within the Canoe Competition at the World Masters Games 2017 held in Auckland.
Lake Pupuke is suitable for swimming but is murky and contains thick vegetation, and there have been drownings. The lake has been tested for bacteria and generally meets safe swimming conditions.

In 2007, recreational fishing has become more prominent since rainbow trout were released into the lake from a fish hatchery. However, since there are no actual streams entering or leaving the lake, trout will not be able to reproduce naturally, and new trout will have to be released periodically. Other fish in the lake include tench, perch, rudd, and carp.

The crater wall has been quarried in several places, most intensely on the western side between Shea Terrace and Rangitira Avenue, where Smales Quarry continues to operate. A long thin lagoon called Quarry Lake has been formed there by flooding a former quarry area.

Lakeside real estate is expensive. Empty lakefront land is rare; one (almost 1,200-square meter) undeveloped parcel cost $2.7 million in 2008. Lake Pupuke is identified as a &quot;high risk&quot; area in the event of a tsunami, and a high-tech phone alert system was developed for North Shore residents in case of an emergency.

<text>Bort, boart, or boort is an umbrella term used in the diamond industry to refer to shards of non-gem-grade/quality diamonds. In the manufacturing and heavy industries, &quot;bort&quot; is used to describe dark, imperfectly formed or crystallized diamonds of varying levels of opacity. The lowest grade, &quot;crushing bort&quot;, is crushed by steel mortars and used to make industrial-grade abrasive grits. Small bort crystals are used in drill bits. The Democratic Republic of the Congo provides 75% of the world supply of crushing bort.

== Use and application ==

Bort is commonly used as an abrasive. Smaller flakes and particles are used as an additive for scouring or polishing pastes and agents. Larger particles can be added to cutting, drilling and grinding tools to improve their lifespan and substantially increase their efficiency.

Bort particles varying from one to two nanometers are added to lubricants such as paraffin oil. These particles will embed themselves into minute irregularities and imperfections of moving-part surfaces. Particles that remain suspended in the lubricant oil act as both a polishing agent, further smoothening the surfaces, and as ball bearings between the surfaces. Such nanotechnology applications with paraffin oil containing approximately 1% of these nano-size bort particles may decrease the friction up to half of that without the nano-particles.

<doc id="1173545" wikidata="Q941744" url="?curid=1173545" title="The Libertines (album)">
<text>The Libertines is the second studio album by the English indie rock band The Libertines. Released on 30 August 2004, it is particularly biographical of the relationship between frontmen Carl Barât and Pete Doherty. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 72,189 copies in its first week of release.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The Libertines&quot;, like its 2002 predecessor, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, was re-released with a bonus DVD on 22 November 2004. The DVD, entitled &quot;Boys in the Band&quot;, is a collection of live shows, band interviews, and the &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Me Now&quot; promotional video.

The song &quot;What Katie Did&quot; was released as a one-sided, 7-inch flexi disc given away with &quot;Amelia&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

The song &quot;Arbeit Macht Frei&quot; featured in the 2006 film &quot;Children of Men&quot;.

===Cover art===
The album&#x27;s front cover art features a photograph of Carl Barât and Pete Doherty taken by Roger Sargent during the emotional &quot;Freedom Gig&quot; at the Tap &#x27;n&#x27; Tin club in Chatham, Kent, on 8 October 2003, when Doherty reunited with the Libertines for a gig just hours after being released from jail, where he was sentenced for breaking into Barât&#x27;s flat and stealing various items, including an old guitar and a laptop computer. Doherty returned to the Tap &#x27;n&#x27; Tin club on 20 December 2008 for a one-off gig with Chas &amp; Dave.

==Reception==
The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2006, NME placed the album 47 in a list of the greatest British albums ever. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 99 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. On the other hand, &quot;The Libertines&quot; was voted the third-most overrated album ever made in a 2005 BBC public poll.

<text>A living street or residential street is a street designed with the interests of pedestrians and cyclists in mind. Living streets also act as social spaces, allowing children to play and encouraging social interactions on a human scale, safely and legally. Living streets consider all pedestrians granting equal access to elders and those who are disabled. These roads are still available for use by motor vehicles; however, their design aims to reduce both the speed and dominance of motorized transport. The reduction of motor vehicle dominance creates more opportunities for public transportation.

Living Streets achieve these strategies by implementing the shared space approach. Reducing demarcations between vehicle traffic and pedestrians create a cohesive space without segregating different modes of transportation. Vehicle parking may also be restricted to designated bays.

These street design principles first became popularized in the Netherlands during the 1970s, and the Dutch word &quot;woonerf&quot; (lit. residential grounds) is often used as a synonym for living street.

==Overview==
===Current street infrastructure in the US===
The U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices focuses primarily on vehicular traffic and how to optimize its movement. Streets are developed to simplify the tasks of the road and to create uniformity. Uniform look and feel of the road reduces perception/reaction time giving everyone similar interpretations which is vital for their performance.(2) The design of the traffic control devices also creates a constant when maintenance is required. These devices focus on the vehicle user to provide adequate meaning and command. Conversely, the concept of a living street focuses on creating healthier, more walkable, and more livable places while optimizing environmental benefits. Living streets aim to prioritize the safety of all street users, especially more vulnerable groups such as pedestrians and cyclists, by improving infrastructure to accommodate all street users. The living street puts a higher priority on the pedestrians rather than the vehicle traffic.
Urban Design Professor Donald Appleyard&#x27;s Street Livability Study in the 1970s suggested streets in the United States were often noisy, polluted, and dangerous, and residents and cities both do not feel in control of creating clean and safe street environments. Livable streets aim to create cleaner and safer environments by &quot;greening&quot; streets and creating spaces where cars are guests to pedestrians and cyclists. Greening consists of improving the natural and built environment through reviving and developing community parks, gardens, and street trees. Establishing living streets is one way that communities can grow their urban infrastructure, further developing these urban strategies can ensure that the environmental assets deliver their full potential. This concept prioritizes the environment and the community over accessibility and movement of traffic. The Dutch woonerf is an example of this concept: it eliminates exclusive spaces for pedestrians and vehicular traffic, instead encouraging the whole street to be accessible to pedestrians and providing traffic calming measures for vehicles. The living environment dominates the built environment on the street, residents replaces their brick streets and integrated more greening to produce a winding serpentine path. In their paper &quot;Reclaiming the Residential Street as a Play Place&quot;, Trantle and Doyle argue that woonerfs increase traffic safety and children are more likely to play near or in the street. The woonerf street give equal opportunity for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles but pedestrians have a priority over the vehicles. This urban living street has demonstrated that it is successful in the Netherlands.

===Purpose of the living street===
The living street reimagines the role of the street by reconsidering its purpose and who it is intended to serve. The street may be cooler, safer, and more walkable when implemented. Living streets produce more attractive spaces that promote the user&#x27;s health and well-being. Spaces create social cohesion within a neighborhood and increase the sense of community while reinforcing cultural identity. Living streets can serve as a recreational space for the neighborhood and improve the air quality through reduced carbon emissions and other air pollutants, as well as improve water quantity and quality. Living streets can also prevent erosion and flooding through green infrastructure, stormwater management, and reuse. Living streets combine three significant components: being green, cool and complete.

===Street concepts===
====Green streets====
Green street design involves implementing stormwater management strategies to protect nearby water sources from pollutants, and encouraging water reuse. Green streets help alleviate water security issues. Drainage systems within a city are designed to provide an outlet for the runoff coming from impervious surfaces. Managing water at the source reduces the pollutants carried into local water supplies. Pollutants can be harmful to local ecosystems and water quality. Introducing green infrastructure into urban developments can make up for the lost opportunities for groundwater to infiltrate the natural environment. Green infrastructure includes permeable pavements, these porous surfaces allow runoff to infiltrate the surface. Bioretention cells or bioswales are areas that contain vegetation that is planted in engineered soil. The soil allows for the filtration and storage of stormwater, recharging groundwater supplies. Producing tree canopies is another aspect of green street design. Street trees with adequate draining allow the rainwater runoff to penetrate the soil and slow stormwater runoff. Street trees also reduce the effects of the urban heat island (see &quot;Cool streets&quot; below) by shading paved surfaces from heat, the environment remains cool. They also use evaporative cooling and can sequester carbon, improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions. Implementing green streets helps to reduce stormwater runoff while increasing the water quality and supply to the urban environment. Creating more resilience to climate change with a healthier community.

====Cool streets====
Cool streets aim to reduce the effects of the urban heat island (UHI). Traditional streets are made of dark impervious materials that absorb energy from the sun and create warmer surrounding temperatures, increasing emissions and stormwater temperatures. These surfaces create a demand for air conditioning to cool structures. Increased conditioning contributes to higher electricity needs, escalating the overall demand within a city. Hotter conditions drive the peak energy up during hot summer days, as conditioning, lights, and appliances contribute to the energy need. Overloading systems and energy grids can lead to blackouts. Power companies can implement controlled brownouts or blackouts during this time to reduce the overall outage time. Hotter conditions can harm human health, causing general discomfort, respiratory difficulties, heat cramps, exhaustion, and non-fatal heat stroke. Implementing green infrastructure and replacing dark impervious materials is a solution to cool the surrounding environment and stormwater runoff. Implementing green infrastructure such as rain gardens, planter boxes, and green parking can reduce the effects of the urban heat island. Reducing dark impervious surfaces with lighter-colored materials reduces air temperature as the street surface reflects solar energy. Cool streets assist in creating cooler communities for residents within them. Through reducing energy usage, increasing water quality, and decreasing emissions. Consequently, lower temperatures reduce both emissions and temperature. This means communities may have fewer temperature-related illnesses, and the temperature of stormwater runoff reduces its impact on aquatic life in receiving waters. These lighter surfaces are also more resistant to heat degradation, and their reflective properties allow for more visibility at night. An increase in reflectivity also contributes to the reduction of energy usage. Street lights can run a lower wattage bulb, reducing demand. Cool streets create environments with reduced air temperatures, generating more comfort.

====Complete streets====
Complete streets are accessible, accommodating, and safe for pedestrians and cyclists. By implementing urban development strategies, active travel, community engagement, and safe access are promoted to develop a street for all users. They are intended to provide social equity for all users. Low-income neighborhoods are most vulnerable to Incomplete streets. Incomplete streets adversely affect the surrounding communities as the conditions can be unsafe and create more significant risks for pedestrians. Incomplete streets have a higher potential for crashes or injury, and effects relating to air pollution can also influence pedestrians. incomplete streets create challenging conditions for pedestrians to walk or bicycle. Incomplete streets create car-dependent barriers and are designed only with cars in mind. Complete Streets provide drivers and other pedestrians opportunities to alter their means of transportation. The reduction of vehicular traffic increases walkability as well as bicycle safety. Complete streets provide the highest priority to walking and sustainable transportation. Complete streets assess factors such as trip duration, path gradation, and typical weather conditions are assessed to see if active travel is possible. Each design of a Complete Street includes various elements. Design strategies in complete streets include lane reductions/width reductions - decreasing the right-of-way of vehicles giving the street back to pedestrians, and creating opportunities for bicycle lanes. Raised crosswalks - a traffic calming device that brings motor traffic to the level pedestrians walk at. Curb extensions and medians increase space for street amenities such as plants, benches, and trees. Strategies implemented within complete streets improve overall health and strengthen urban ecosystems. Complete streets create environments enticing pedestrians to walk or bike. The spaces created in a complete street also encourage social interactions and productive areas. Cities are actively designing streets to prioritize pedestrian traffic efficiently and safely, create streets that reduce air pollution, and absorb storm runoff. (40) Developing complete streets also considers future technology. Future development of autonomous vehicles will reduce parking demand.

==History==
===Progress in the United States===

Since the late 19th century American planners have faced problems concerning traffic congestion and street safety. The two typical designs of American neighborhoods were the gridiron plan and curvilinear street, but safety concerns regarding motor vehicles brought new street patterns in the 1920s, one being the &quot;neighborhood unit.&quot; The Radburn plan developed by Henry Wright and Clarence Stein in the late 1920s as well as Clarence Perry&#x27;s proposal in 1933 used the &quot;neighborhood unit&quot; to try to encourage prevention of traffic on residential streets.

In the 1930s and 1940s, increased highway traffic provoked the publication of the Community Builders Handbook. Written by the Federal Housing Administration, the handbook provided a hierarchy of street types such as arterial, collector and minor access. However, unsafe conditions were still being observed, and street types were not meeting their intent. Following this, cul de sacs and diverters were used in places such as Montclair and Grand Rapids to encourage streets to fulfill their assigned street type. In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive urban development projects concerning housing and highway construction brought increased volumes of traffic and improvements focused on the flow of the motorized vehicle. Colin Buchanan&#x27;s Traffic in Towns published in 1963 in England introduced his American companions to the concept of &quot;environmental areas&quot;, places where pedestrians are safe from motorized vehicles. He acknowledged that there was an environmental capacity to every street, and pedestrian safety, air and noise pollution, and lighting were all of particular concern. This report influenced design in countries such as Sweden and Australia as well as San Francisco&#x27;s Urban Design Plan.

At the national level, the Federal Highway Administration sponsored a study conducted by Donald Appleyard in the 1970s looking at the impacts of traffic on residential streets. From the study (which looked at 500 homes in the San Francisco area in comparison to other international street designs) they found that residents were deterred by the unsafe travel speeds of motorized vehicles. This was a particular concern in areas with child and elderly populations. Noise and pollution decreased the overall livability of the streets, while more social interaction and perceived privacy was found on streets with lower traffic volumes. Stress, occupancy turnover, and adapting to unsafe living conditions were also results of unfavorable traffic conditions. The findings of Appleyard&#x27;s Street Livability Study inspired the San Francisco City Planning Board to launch the San Francisco Urban Design Plan in 1971 which introduced the idea of the &quot;protected residential area.&quot; The goal of the design was to slow down traffic to acceptable speeds in residential areas through infrastructure improvements for active transport as well as traffic calming measures. While the city&#x27;s focus in street design used to be increasing the flow of motor traffic, this new approach discouraged high travel speeds. Following this plan, San Francisco developed the Protected Residential Area Program (PRA) which allowed neighborhoods to petition for traffic management measures. This encouraged community participation as well as equity and safety for all residents.

===Influence from other countries===
Dutch, Danish, and German cities have incorporated several design concepts and policies surrounding traffic management. They have seen improvements in overall street safety and for the more vulnerable modes of transport such as walking and cycling. The focus on active transport in countries like the Netherlands may be attributed to the more car restrictive policies they have had in place since the 1970s. The woonerf, home zone and &quot;Spielstraße&quot; require motorists to drive at walking speeds and yield to pedestrians, cyclists, and playing children who have the same rights in road use.

These cities have implemented traffic calming measures, have dedicated auto-free zones for pedestrians and cyclists, enforce lower travel speeds, and have limited and more expensive parking compared to the United States. They have no turn on red, a concept the United States has had since the 1970s which has led to a drastic increase in pedestrian and cyclist injuries. Street design in the United States tends to focus more on travel speed of motorized vehicles. In these European countries, the mindset is that motorists should anticipate the actions of pedestrians and cyclists. Their traffic calming measures have had a significant impact on traffic crashes: Dutch neighborhoods have seen traffic crashes reduced by up to 70% in some areas, whereas a study looking at Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands found that traffic-related injuries in traffic calming neighborhoods fell by about 53%.

These studies and ideas have changed some of the mindsets and ideas of street planning and design in the United States. Some planners and designs in the United States now see the street as a place to live, gather, and play instead of a means to get from one place to another. They have started to address how to make streets clean and safe for everyone, and a place where the community can gather and socialize.

Some cities in the US such as Portland and Minneapolis have increased cycling rates over five-fold from 1990 to 2008 through the implementation of the same practices used in Europe, such as improved cycling infrastructure, public education on traffic safety, integration with public transportation, increased bike sharing, and traffic calming measures. These cities have found that even though the United States has a history and culture associated with using motorized vehicles as a means of commuting, policies and infrastructure can influence people&#x27;s actions and habits.

===Post-COVID city===

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked proposals for radical change in the organization of cities. Barcelona was one city that proposed a radical change. The Manifesto for the Reorganisation of Barcelona was published after COVID-19. One hundred sixty academics and three hundred architects signed the manifesto, written by architecture and urban theorist Massimo Paolini. The manifesto proposed pedestrianization of the whole city, prioritizing bicycle transport and efficient public transportation. The concept of a living street was a vital part of the manifesto. Reduction of vehicle traffic during the pandemic positively impacted the environment as air and noise pollution significantly decreased. Residents put emphasis on the idea of a living street as it would introduce more nature into the city. Living streets in Barcelona create opportunities for children to have a safe environment to play. COVID-19 increased the desire for areas dedicated to urban green spaces, as these areas became places of refuge during the pandemic. The re-naturalization of the city is now held to a higher standard as it guarantees an increase in human health and wellbeing. The manifesto inspired other Spanish cities to publish their own version adapted to the local context: Granada, Zaragoza, Guadalajara, the Basque Country and the initiative Ciudades Sostenibles.

==Design==
The design of the living street aims to promote safe walking and cycling, emphasizing pedestrians. Living Streets are achieved by restricting car use and parking, diminishing convenience to motor vehicles. Decreasing vehicular traffic increases the appeal for Sustainable modes of transportation. This is accomplished through better infrastructure, traffic calming, integration of walking and cycling with public transport, policies that encourage mixed-use development, regulations that are sensitive to more vulnerable populations and commuters, and community traffic education. Proponents believe a successful design cannot simply be individual measures taken but a combined, comprehensive approach that implements all these factors into a fully integrated and incorporated design.

===Environmental design===

Environmental design elements in a living street provide strategies to mitigate stormwater runoff and reduce the urban heat island effect. Green infrastructure such as roadside plantings, rain gardens, and other strategies have a growing importance as stormwater runoff is a fast-growing source of pollution. Impervious pavements repel stormwater, decreasing the amount of water that surfaces can absorb. Stormwater runoff absorbs any pollutants present on the surface. Contaminants such as road salt, fertilizers, oil, or chemicals from cars can dirty the runoff. Storm drains that lead directly into public waterways carries these pollutants, causing harm to the nutrients and health of the public waterways. Managing stormwater through environmental design keeps the water clean and healthy from pollutants. Green infrastructure such as permeable paving and bioretention planters and swales are strategies that can reduce the effects of stormwater runoff. Permeable pavement can be used for sidewalks, bike lanes, parking lanes, and low-volume streets to allow water to infiltrate through surfaces and reduce runoff to nearby water. Pervious pavement promotes healthy runoff by increasing infiltration through the soil layers before reaching a resting state. Bioretention planters and bioswales are typically used in planting strips or curb bulb-outs to treat stormwater runoff. Swales consist of deep channels of native plants combined with engineered soil that allows them to handle large amounts of water. The deep channels increase the water captured and filter out solids and other contaminants. In addition to stormwater management, street trees, and urban canopies assist in shading surfaces and protecting them from the sun. Trees contribute to natural stormwater management by cutting off some rainwater before hitting the ground. Street trees also reduce surrounding temperatures and improve air quality. Providing shade and stormwater management can lead to a longer infrastructure life, saving replacement costs and turnover for the surfaces. Implementing environmental design strategies improves the quality of life by reducing air temperatures and pollution and improving water quality. 

===Traffic calming measures===

In order to reclaim streets as a play area for children and a place for the community to gather and socialize, traffic calming measures can be put in place. This may include introducing speed bumps, changing the surface of the road, or creating artificial chicanes. These measures physically enforce reasonable speeds, rather than signage which can have little effect on the driver&#x27;s actions - instead, drivers are forced to be more aware of their actions and the actions of other street users. Other traffic calming measures include raised intersections and pedestrian crossings which bring the vehicles to the pedestrian level, indicating cars do not have full ownership of the road and must be vigilant of other road users. Chicanes, narrower travel lanes, and roundabouts purposefully slow down cars to safer speeds. Extensive car-free areas, wide, well-lit sidewalks, refuge islands for crossings, crossing signals, and zebra crossings provide safe and convenient facilities for more vulnerable road users. The woonerf in the Netherlands incorporates some of these traffic calming techniques but goes further in that it uses the concept of the shared street where separate spaces are not defined and pedestrians have access to the entire street. Developing the street more by filling in the &quot;street wall&quot; is another design measure to encourage walking and cycling. This concept consists of filling in the empty spaces and large parking lots often found adjacent to streets to make the street not only more attractive or inviting but also more accessible to these active commuters. In addition, moving parking lots to the back of the store like found in European countries gives priority to pedestrians and cyclists near the entrance.

Living streets focus on how to best move people and not just the car. The design aims resolve issues such as high-speed traffic arterials, too few intersections, and lack of sidewalks. There may be dedicated transit lanes, sidewalks and bike lanes, and spaces that serve the entire community regardless of age, income, or ability. Measures such as bike lanes and safe, accessible maintained sidewalks will provide the infrastructure for the community to become active commuters. Further design strategies such as medians can serve as a safety net for pedestrians and indicate pedestrian presence for motor vehicles, while reducing lane and land width and bulb-outs can decrease a pedestrian&#x27;s crossing distance. Speed bumps and traffic circles can make the street seem like less of a highway. Instead, these measures encourage lower travel speeds and therefore bring increased safety for other street users. Adequate signage, signals, and lighting can also be used to make all users aware the street is a shared space. These measures may require even less space to carry more people.

===Compact and mixed-use development===

Compact and mixed-use development is another strategy of the living street since how land is used will determine trip distances and preferred modes of transportation. Cycling is typically done at distances below 3 km and walking is typically done at distances below 1 km. If trip destinations are within walking or cycling distance, people may utilize the sidewalks and bike lanes for their commute. In addition, compact neighborhoods will also make transit a realistic option because the population will exist to provide the necessary ridership. Advocates suggest establishing strong neighborhood centers with local accessibility - instead of creating separate commercial and residential areas, which promote car use through increased trip lengths – that will lead to more sustainable and livable conditions.

==Benefits==
Living streets are sustainable from an economical, environmental, and social view. They can promote public health through the different modes of active transport offered as well as social equity through enhancing livability for all users. The design is intended to reduce traffic danger and increase safety using modes of active transport that have minimal noise and air pollution and use far fewer non-renewable resources compared to motorized transportation. By reducing the number of cars and incorporating public and active transport, living streets can move more people with the same or less amount of space than the current street since these modes take up far less space than cars, whether in use or in storage.

===Health===
The design of living streets makes it easier for people to satisfy the need for daily physical activity since they can walk or cycle as a part of their commute. Walking and cycling provides a form of physical activity and accounts for numerous health benefits that can combat current concerns for public health. In comparing obesity rates with walking and cycling for commuters between countries, studies show that the countries with a greater number of cyclist and pedestrian commuters tend to have lower rates of obesity. Lack of exercise can also lead to other chronic health problems like diabetes or heart disease. In addition, walking and cycling can reduce the number of cars on the street, bringing a reduction in air, water and noise pollution as well as carbon emissions. This cleaner air may also reduce asthma and other respiratory diseases in urban areas. The CLAN study conducted by Carver and Crawford in 2008 revealed that the built environment and street design can also play a role in the health and wellbeing of children.

===Safety===
Government injury rate statistics from Californian cities and European countries show that higher numbers of cycling and walking may increase safety. Public health consultants such as Peter Jacobsen suggest this is because there is a greater awareness of cyclist and pedestrian movements so motor vehicles are more prepared to react and avoid crashes. In addition, motorists may also be cyclists or pedestrians themselves which makes them more sensitive to the needs and rights of these more vulnerable groups. Larger groups of these active commuters may also justify more rights to the road and an increase in improving and enhancing public infrastructure geared toward them. Fewer cars can also reduce traffic congestion.

===Social===
Living streets give more options for how people travel or get from one place to another and balances options so it is safe for all users. In addition, revitalizing existing areas instead of continuing suburban sprawl helps utilize and build upon past investments in infrastructure. This revitalization may include improved infrastructure that encourages people to sit, walk, and gather instead of being driven away by noisy traffic polluting the air. In addition, more people out and about in the streets can help reduce crime.

The concept of living streets also works to prevent alienation children may have with their surroundings by providing them spaces to play and develop in an outdoor environment. The spaces allow children to experience different environments and communities as well as the ability to develop new relationships with others in these safer spaces. As a result, children living near these streets will be healthier individuals since they have a greater and safer exposure to the environment around them and are able to develop relationships and interact with various individuals.

===Equity===
Living street designs are intended to serve all users. The concept hopes to advance livability for the entire community by envisioning the street as providing multiple benefits for several types of users instead of simply a means for motorized traffic to get from one place to another. This investment in public infrastructure also seeks to provide more economical alternatives for the user since they can rely on other modes of transportation to get from place to place.

Instead of focusing solely on the movement of cars, living streets are designed to move people and focus more broadly on several different modes of transportation that can be accessible to all people. A significant deterrent to active transport is a lack of traffic safety, especially to groups of society like the elderly and children who are more vulnerable to these dangers and, with current streets, often need more protection from car traffic. Increased walking and cycling in these groups would improve their physical activity and expand their mobility and independence.

In addition, current streets may have uninviting landscapes or be unsafe to walk or bike on, meaning driving a car is often the only safe or practical option. There is no place to gather or congregate or for children to play, and it is hard for the more vulnerable groups like children and those with disabilities to travel in anything but the car. Since lower income or senior citizens may not be able to afford or operate cars and rely on other modes of transportation to move around and be independent, living streets provide more economical and independent modes of transport. In addition, implementation of street trees, foundations, and plazas can allow people to gather and enjoy the street in a shared and communal experience.

==Counterarguments==
Opponents to the living street believe that if more people opt for active transport alternatives as opposed to utilizing motor vehicles, travel time will increase significantly and will be inconvenient for commuters. They also believe that unless people utilize the infrastructure for active transport the living street provides, other nearby non-living streets will be congested due to the hindrance the living street creates for the motor vehicle.

<doc id="1173560" wikidata="Q1938805" url="?curid=1173560" title="Misericord">
<text>A misericord (sometimes named mercy seat, like the biblical object) is a small wooden structure formed on the underside of a folding seat in a church which, when the seat is folded up, is intended to act as a shelf to support a person in a partially standing position during long periods of prayer.

==Origins==

Prayers in the early medieval church at the daily divine offices (i.e. Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline) were said standing with uplifted hands. The old or infirm could use crutches or, as time went on, a (literally &#x27;pity of the heart&#x27;, to create an act of mercy). For these times of required standing, seating was constructed so that the seats could be turned up. However, the undersides sometimes had a small shelf, a misericord, allowing the user to lean against it, slightly reducing their discomfort. Like most other medieval woodwork in churches, they were usually skillfully carved and often show detailed scenes, even though they were hidden underneath the seats, especially in the choir stalls of the choir around the altar. Despite being located in churches, it was not considered appropriate for these sculptures to portray religious motifs, as people rested their buttocks against them. As such, misericords portrayed a wide range of subjects from secular life and folklore unrelated to the Bible. 

==History==
The earliest mention of the misericord dates to the 11th century. Surviving misericords in English churches date from the start of the 13th century right up until the 21st century, although after the beginning of the 17th century they are viewed as modern copies with little or no historical importance. Remnant&#x27;s 1969 catalogue dismisses everything after that date as &quot;modern&quot;, rarely even affording it a description, but there are many wonderful carvings from the Victorian era, and even the modern day. The earliest set of misericords can be found in the choir stalls of Exeter Cathedral and date from the middle of the 13th century. Slightly earlier individual examples are present at Christchurch Priory and St Mary the Virgin, Hemingbrough. The vast majority of English misericords date from the 14th and 15th centuries and are curiously most often depictions of secular or pagan images and scenes, entirely at odds with the Christian iconography and aesthetic that surround them.

Many stalls with misericords were once part of monastic or collegiate churches, but under the Reformation many were either destroyed or broken up to be dispersed amongst parish churches. Those that survived were further depleted by 17th-century iconoclasts and Victorian reformers. One set at Chester was destroyed by Dean Howson because he deemed it improper, although 43 of the original medieval scenes remain. The woodcarvers came from Lincoln in the late 14th century and moved on to Westminster Hall when they had finished the choir, three years later. It is said that it was the apprentices who were allowed to carve the seats, while the masters did the more impressive works.

==Eastern Orthodox use==
Misericords are found to this day on &quot;kathismata&quot;, the choir stalls used by Eastern Orthodox monastics. These tend to be much simpler than their Western counterparts, usually being a simple strip of rounded wood with little or no ornamentation. Their use is very common in the Greek Orthodox Church, though Russian Orthodox monasteries tend not to have individual choir stalls, but simple benches for the brethren to sit on. Orthodox Christians stand throughout the long divine services, rather than sit or kneel, though some seating is provided for the elderly and infirm. Whereas Greek monks will tend to lean in their stalls during the services, Russian monks usually stand upright.

==Misericord (room)==
A distinct (but related) use of the word is to denote a room in a medieval Benedictine monastery where some part of the community would eat on any given day. The Rule of Saint Benedict included strict rules on the food allowed for monks in the refectory: for example, it provided for a complete ban on the meat of four-legged animals except for the sick. In a late medieval monastery, a schedule would send half of all monks to dine in the refectory, and the other half to the misericord, where the Rule of Saint Benedict was not in effect and they could indulge in meat. At Westminster Abbey, the misericord was constructed sometime between 1230 and 1270.

==Cultural impact==
As the &#x27;hidden&#x27; position and &#x27;vernacular&#x27; iconography of misericords have prompted them to be seen as a subversive art-form, they have re-appeared as motifs in modern art and literature.

<doc id="1173562" wikidata="Q5315790" url="?curid=1173562" title="Dunvegan (electoral district)">
<text>Dunvegan was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting from 1959 to 1971, and again from 1986 to 2004.

The seat for Dunvegan in the Leglislative Assembly was held by the governing party for every year it existed. The riding was named for the small community of Dunvegan, once home to a fur trade post, and now the site of a provincial park and historic site.

==History==

===Boundary history===
The first riding named Dunvegan was created out of the western half of Peace River in 1959. It was bounded on the south by the Peace River and extended north to the Northwest Territories border, containing the entire northwest corner of Alberta. When it was abolished in 1971, the north section of the riding was transferred back to Peace River, and the southern two-thirds of the riding, along with the northern half of Spirit River, became Spirit River-Fairview.

In 1986 Dunvegan was re-created, replacing all of Spirit River-Fairview and a small part of Smoky River. In 1993 it absorbed another part of Smoky River (including the community of Falher) as well as a small part of Peace River (including Grimshaw).

The Dunvegan electoral district was dissolved in the 2003 electoral boundary re-distribution, and replaced by the Dunvegan-Central Peace electoral district for the 2004 Alberta general election with no changes to the district&#x27;s boundaries.

===Representation history===

The first MLA for Dunvegan was Joseph Scruggs, who narrowly picked the riding up for the governing Social Credit. He did not run for re-election in 1963, but Ernest Lee held the riding for the government for two more terms.

The riding was then replaced by Spirit River-Fairview, which was picked up by New Democrat leader Grant Notley, who held that riding almost until it was replaced by Dunvegan in 1986.

In that election, the governing Progressive Conservatives would win the riding for the first time, despite an NDP surge elsewhere in the province. MLA Glen Clegg represented the area for five terms, retiring in 2001.

PC candidate Hector Goudreau would hold the riding for the government in its final term, and went on to represent Dunvegan-Central Peace for both terms it existed, as well as Dunvegan-Central Peace-Notley until 2015.

<doc id="1173571" wikidata="Q1122971" url="?curid=1173571" title="The Warriors (film)">
<text>The Warriors is a 1979 American action thriller film directed by Walter Hill. Based on Sol Yurick&#x27;s 1965 novel of the same name, the film centers on a fictitious New York City street gang who must travel from the north end of the Bronx to their home turf on Coney Island in southern Brooklyn after they are framed for the murder of a respected gang leader. The film was theatrically released in the United States on February 9, 1979, by Paramount Pictures.

After reports of vandalism and violence, Paramount Pictures temporarily halted their advertising campaign and released theater owners from their obligation to show the film. Despite its initially negative reception, &quot;The Warriors&quot; has since become a cult film and has been reappraised by film critics. The film has spawned several spinoffs, including video games and a comic book series.

In his book about the film, author Sean Egan summarized its appeal: &quot;Whereas the milieu of &quot;The Warriors&quot; was one normally only depicted in motion pictures as an examination of a social problem, this movie portrayed life from the street gang&#x27;s point of view. It was an obvious but revolutionary approach that struck a chord with the urban working class, especially its adolescent subset.&quot;

==Plot==
Cyrus, leader of the Gramercy Riffs, the most powerful gang in New York City, requests that each of the city&#x27;s gangs send nine unarmed delegates to Van Cortlandt Park for a midnight summit. The Warriors, a gang from Coney Island, send a delegation consisting of &quot;warlord&quot; (leader) Cleon; &quot;war chief&quot; (second-in-command) Swan; scout Fox; enforcer Ajax; graffiti artist Rembrandt; music-man Snow; bearer Vermin and soldiers Cowboy and Cochise. Cyrus proposes a citywide truce and alliance to the assembled crowd, allowing the gangs to control the city together since they collectively outnumber the police by 3 to 1.

Most of the gang members applaud this idea, but Luther, the unbalanced and sadistic leader of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus dead as police officers arrive to raid the summit. In the chaos, Luther realizes that Fox witnessed his actions and falsely accuses the Warriors of responsibility, leading the vengeful Riffs to attack Cleon fatally. Meanwhile, the other Warriors escape, unaware that they have been implicated in Cyrus&#x27;s killing. The Riffs put out a hit on the Warriors through a radio DJ. To Ajax&#x27;s disappointment, Swan takes charge of the group as they try to get home.

The Turnbull ACs spot the Warriors and try to run them down with a modified school bus, but they escape and board an elevated train. On the ride to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a building fire alongside the tracks, stranding the Warriors in Tremont. Setting out on foot, they encounter the Orphans, who are insecure about their low status as they were excluded from Cyrus&#x27;s meeting. After Mercy, the girlfriend of the Orphans&#x27; leader, instigates a confrontation, Swan throws a Molotov cocktail, and the Warriors run to the nearest subway station. Impressed and desperate to escape her depressed neighborhood, Mercy follows the Warriors.

When the group arrives at the 96th Street and Broadway station in Manhattan, they are pursued by police and separated. Vermin, Cochise, and Rembrandt escape by boarding a subway car. Fox, struggling with a police officer, is thrown onto the tracks and killed by a passing train as Mercy flees the scene. The Baseball Furies chase Swan, Ajax, Snow, and Cowboy into Riverside Park, but they are defeated in a brawl. After the fight, Ajax sees a lone woman sitting on a park bench and leaves the group despite Swan&#x27;s objections. When Ajax becomes sexually aggressive, the woman reveals herself as an undercover police officer and arrests him.

Upon arriving at Union Square, Vermin, Cochise, and Rembrandt are seduced by an all-female gang called the Lizzies and invited into their hideout. They narrowly escape the Lizzies&#x27; subsequent attack, learning in the process that the gangland community believes the Warriors murdered Cyrus. As a lone scout, Swan returns to the 96th Street station, where Mercy joins him (although he spurns her advances). After reaching the Union Square station, they reunite with the remaining Warriors and fight with a roller-skating gang, the Punks, which allows Mercy to prove herself in combat. Meanwhile, an unidentified gang member visits the Riffs and tells them that he saw Luther shoot Cyrus.

At dawn, the Warriors finally reach Coney Island, only to find Luther and the Rogues waiting for them. Swan challenges Luther to single combat, but Luther pulls a gun instead. Swan dodges his shot and throws a switchblade into Luther&#x27;s wrist, disarming him. The Riffs arrive, acknowledging the Warriors&#x27; courage and skill before apprehending the Rogues. As the Riffs descend upon him, Luther screams. The radio DJ announces that the hit on the Warriors has been canceled and salutes them with a song, &quot;In the City.&quot; The film ends with Swan, Mercy, and the rest of the gang walking down a Coney Island beach illuminated by the rising sun.

==Cast==

Featured as gang leaders in the film are Paul Greco as the leader of the Orphans, Jery Hewitt as the leader of the Baseball Furies, Kate Klugman as the leader of the Lizzies, and Konrad Sheehan as the leader of the Punks. Stunt coordinator and future director Craig R. Baxley appears as a member of the Punks, as does stuntman A.J. Bakunas, who was killed on the set of the movie &quot;Steel&quot; before the film&#x27;s release. Steve James and Bill Anagnos portray Baseball Furies, while Dennis Gregory portrays a Gramercy Riff. Mercedes Ruehl plays the policewoman who arrests Ajax, with Irwin Keyes and Sonny Landham also appearing as police officers. Ginny Ortiz portrays the candy store employee whom the Rogues steal from and John Snyder portrays a gas station worker. In a pre-credits scene deleted from the theatrical version but reinstated in television broadcasts, Pamela Poitier (a daughter of Sidney Poitier) portrays Lincoln, Cleon&#x27;s girlfriend.

===Development===
The film is based on Sol Yurick&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The Warriors&quot;, which was, in turn, based on Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;. Film rights were bought in 1969 by American International Pictures but no film resulted.

Rights were then obtained by producer Lawrence Gordon who commissioned David Shaber to write a script. Gordon had made &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978) with Walter Hill; he sent the script to Hill with a copy of Sol Yurick&#x27;s novel. Hill recalls, &quot;I said &#x27;Larry, I would love to do this, but nobody will let us do it.&#x27; It was going to be too extreme and too weird.&quot;

Gordon and Hill were originally going to make a western but when the financing on the project failed to materialize, they took &quot;The Warriors&quot; to Paramount Pictures because they were interested in youth films at the time and succeeded in getting the project financed. Hill remembers &quot;it came together very quickly. Larry had a special relationship with Paramount and we promised to make the movie very cheaply, which we did. So it came together within a matter of weeks. I think we got the green light in April or May 1978 and we were in theaters in February 1979. So it was a very accelerated process.&quot;

Hill was drawn to the &quot;extreme narrative simplicity and stripped down quality of the script&quot;. The script, as written, was a realistic take on street gangs but Hill was a huge fan of comic books and wanted to divide the film into chapters and then have each chapter &quot;come to life starting with a splash panel&quot;. However, Hill was working on a low budget and a tight post-production schedule because of a fixed release date as the studio wanted to release &quot;The Warriors&quot; before a rival gang picture called &quot;The Wanderers&quot;. Hill was finally able to include this type of scene transition in the Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut released for home video in 2005.

===Casting===
The filmmakers did extensive casting in New York City. Hill was considering hiring Sigourney Weaver from &quot;Alien&quot; and watched a movie she had filmed in Israel called &quot;Madman&quot; where the male lead opposite Weaver was played by Michael Beck. The director was impressed with Beck&#x27;s performance and cast him in &quot;The Warriors&quot;. Hill initially wanted a Puerto Rican actress for the role of Mercy, but Deborah Van Valkenburgh&#x27;s agent convinced the film&#x27;s casting directors to see her and she was eventually cast. The filmmakers wanted to cast Tony Danza in the role of Vermin but he was cast in the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; and Terry Michos was cast instead. While there were white characters in Yurick&#x27;s book, none of the central characters or protagonists were white: according to Hill, Paramount did not want an all-black cast for &quot;commercial reasons&quot;.

Hill saw Thomas G. Waites as the next James Dean, and the director &quot;invited the young actor to the Gulf and Western to watch movies like &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot; for inspiration.&quot; During the screening, Hill offered Waites a drink, which Waites refused, resulting in a rift between the two that grew worse during the grueling summer shoot. At one point, Waites threatened to report the working conditions to the Screen Actors Guild, forcing Paramount to provide a second trailer for the eight Warriors to share.

Finally eight weeks into principal photography, when the tension on set between Waites and Hill reached the breaking point, Hill demanded that stunt coordinator Craig Baxley improvise a stunt scene in which Waites&#x27; character would be killed. &quot;Stunned, Baxley demurred. Such a critical scene would take careful planning. But Hill was insistent. &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a shit how you kill him,&#x27; Baxley recalls the director saying. &#x27;Kill him.&#x27;&quot; Baxley found a crew member who resembled Waites and staged a scene in which the character is thrown off a subway platform in front of an approaching train. &quot;It was like someone cut my soul out and left a shell&quot;, Waites remembers. He would later demand that his name be removed from the cast altogether; he remains uncredited to this day. Both Waites and Hill have expressed regret over how the situation was handled and since made up.

===Filming===

Stunt coordinator Craig R. Baxley put the cast through stunt school because Hill wanted realistic fights depicted in the film. In preparation for his role, James Remar hung out at Coney Island to find a model for his character. The entire film was shot on the streets in New York City with some interior scenes done at Astoria Studios. They would shoot from sundown to sunrise. The film quickly fell behind schedule and went over budget. Although the Conclave scene at the beginning was supposed to be in The Bronx, it was actually filmed in Riverside Park in Manhattan. The bathroom fight scene against The Punks was shot in a studio. The entire movie was only filmed in Manhattan, Brooklyn &amp; Queens. Actor Joel Weiss remembers that filming of his scene on Avenue A, in Manhattan&#x27;s notorious Alphabet City, was canceled because there was a double homicide nearby. For the big meeting at the beginning of the film, Hill wanted real gang members in the scene with off duty police officers also in the crowd so that there would be no trouble.

The studio would not allow Baxley to bring any stunt men from Hollywood and he needed someone to double for the character of Cyrus so he did the stunt himself dressed as the character. Actual gang members wanted to challenge some of the cast members but were dealt with by production security. The actors playing the Warriors bonded early in the shoot, on and off the set. Originally, the character of Fox was supposed to end up with Mercy, while Swan was captured by a rival, homosexual gang known as the Dingos, only to escape later. However, Hill watched the dailies and felt that Beck and Van Valkenburgh had great chemistry; the script was rewritten so that their characters ended up together.

The Rogues&#x27; car in the Coney Island confrontation was a 1955 Cadillac hearse. Hill was underwhelmed by the script&#x27;s depiction of Luther taunting the Warriors, and asked actor David Patrick Kelly for ideas. Kelly first proposed using two dead pigeons, which was rejected. While Hill left to adjust some cameras, Kelly went under the boardwalk and emerged with some discarded beer bottles: when Hill returned to the car to ask what he had come up with, Kelly clinked the bottles together with his fingers and ad-libbed the now-iconic line, &quot;Warriors, come out to play.&quot; Hill immediately declared, &quot;Go with that. Don&#x27;t change it. Let&#x27;s shoot.&quot;

Hill wanted Orson Welles to do a narrated introduction about Greek themes but the studio did not like this idea and refused to pay for it. However this sequence was finally included in the 2005 Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut, with Hill providing the narration himself. &quot;I wanted to take it into a fantasy element, but at the same time add some contemporary flash&quot;, said Hill. &quot;Those were some of the hard ideas we had to get the studio to understand. But we did not get along very well with our parent company. After the movie came out and it did well, everybody was sort of friends. But up until then there was a lot of misunderstanding. They thought it was going to be &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; or something.&quot;

==Release==
===Theatrical run===
On , &quot;The Warriors&quot; opened in 670 theaters, without advance screenings or a decent promotional campaign, but still grossed US$3.5 million on its opening weekend (equivalent to $ million in ).

===Violence at screenings===
The following weekend, the film was linked to sporadic outbreaks of vandalism and three killings—two in Southern California and one in Boston—involving moviegoers on their way to or from showings.

Paramount was prompted to remove advertisements from radio and television completely and display ads in the press were reduced to the film&#x27;s title, rating and participating theaters. As a reaction, 200 theaters across the country added security personnel. Due to safety concerns, theater owners were relieved of their contractual obligations if they did not want to show the film, and Paramount offered to pay costs for additional security and damages due to vandalism.

Hill later remembered: 

==Reception==
===Box office===
After two weeks free of incidents, the studio expanded the display ads to take advantage of reviews from reputable critics including Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She wrote, &quot;&quot;The Warriors&quot; is a real moviemaker&#x27;s movie: it has in visual terms the kind of impact that &#x27;Rock Around the Clock&#x27; did behind the titles of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;. &quot;The Warriors&quot; is like visual rock.&quot; At Seattle&#x27;s Grand Illusion Cinema, programmer Zack Carlson remembers, &quot;people were squeezed in, lying on the floor, cheering.&quot; By its sixth week, &quot;The Warriors&quot; had grossed $16.4 million, well above its estimated $4 million to $7 million budget.

Walter Hill reflected:

What made it a success with young people... is that for the first time somebody made a film within Hollywood, big distribution, that took the gang situation and did not present it as a social problem. Presented them as a neutral or positive aspect of their lives. As soon as you said in the old days &quot;gang movies&quot;, it was &quot;how do we cure the pestilence and how do we fix the social waste. We want to take these kids, make sure they go to college...&quot; This was just a movie that conceptually was different. Accepted the idea of the gang, didn&#x27;t question it. That was their lives, they functioned within that context. And the social problem wasn&#x27;t &quot;were they going to college&quot;, but &quot;were they going to survive&quot;. It&#x27;s the great Hawksian dictum, where is the drama? Will he live or die? That&#x27;s the drama.

&quot;Hollywood forgives a lot when you have a hit,&quot; he added. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say about it, other than the fact that it was just a gift in terms of getting it. The studio hated it, and didn&#x27;t even want to release it. There was a lot of friction with management at the time. Some of it might have been my fault.&quot;

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Warriors&quot; received negative reviews from contemporary critics, who derided its lack of realism and found its dialogue stilted. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave it two out of four stars and wrote that, despite Hill&#x27;s cinematic skill, the film is implausible in a mannerist style that deprives the characters of depth and spontaneity: &quot;No matter what impression the ads give, this isn&#x27;t even remotely intended as an action film. It&#x27;s a set piece. It&#x27;s a ballet of stylized male violence.&quot;

However, Ebert later wrote during a review of Hill&#x27;s film &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; that he felt he overlooked some positive qualities in &quot;The Warriors&quot; out of his dislike for Hill&#x27;s general approach to broad characterizations. Gene Siskel gave the film one star out of four, likening the dialogue to that of &quot;Harvey Lembeck in those silly &#x27;60s motorcycle pictures&quot; and concluding, &quot;You would think after watching &#x27;The Warriors&#x27; that gang membership was a victimless crime, save for the occasional sadist who pops up as comic relief. This entire film is a romantic lie.&quot;

Linda Gross of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;an insightful, stylized and shallow portrayal of gang warfare that panders to angry youthful audiences.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;None of Hill&#x27;s dynamism will save &quot;The Warriors&quot; from impressing most neutral observers as a ghastly folly.&quot; In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;Another problem arises when the gang members open their mouths: their banal dialogue is jarringly at odds with Hill&#x27;s hyperbolic visual scheme.&quot;

Frank Rich of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;unfortunately, sheer visual zip is not enough to carry the film; it drags from one scuffle to the next ... &quot;The Warriors&quot; is not lively enough to be cheap fun or thoughtful enough to be serious.&quot; Yurick expressed his disappointment and speculated that it scared some people because &quot;it appeals to the fear of a demonic uprising by lumpen youth&quot;, appealing to many teenagers because it &quot;hits a series of collective fantasies.&quot; President Ronald Reagan was a fan of the film, even calling lead actor Michael Beck to tell him he had screened it at Camp David and enjoyed it.

=== Censorship ===
In France, the movie was X-rated for incitement to violence on June 25, 1979, by the Movies Control Board (&quot;Commission de contrôle des films cinématographiques&quot;, the official organism tasked with classifying films) which deemed that the work gave &quot;a very realistic vision of the urban guerrilla warfare that gangs can develop to conquer a city.&quot; In order to allow the movie to be released in normal theaters, 10 minutes were cut, including the speech by Cleon. In 1980, the movie was finally rerated as banned for viewers under 13 and the missing scenes were finally readded back

===Cult status===

&quot;The Warriors&quot; has become a cult film, and some film critics have since re-examined it. As of December 2023, the film garnered an 88% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;As violent as it is stylish, &quot;The Warriors&quot; is a thrilling piece of pulp filmmaking.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the 16th-greatest cult film on its 2003 &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cult Films&quot; list, and ranked it 14th in its 2008 list of the &quot;25 Most Controversial Movies Ever&quot;.

Hill reflected in 2016:

I love the fact that people still enjoy something I did what, 37 years ago? It makes an old man happy. I&#x27;m surprised by it. But I loved working with my cameraman Andy Laszlo in shooting it, and I loved working with my cast, who were incredibly trusting of this crazy old fucker that was making the movie. They didn&#x27;t get it, I don&#x27;t think—costumed gangs running around New York?—but they just went with it.

===Home video===
The film was first released on VHS in 1980, LaserDisc in 1981, and DVD in 2001. The DVD contained the theatrical cut unrestored; this release has since fallen out of print. Then, in 2005, Paramount Home Entertainment released the &quot;Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; DVD of &quot;The Warriors&quot;. In addition to remastered picture quality and a new 5.1 surround remixed soundtrack, the film was re-edited with a new introduction and comic book-style sequences between scenes. In July 2007, the &quot;Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; was released on Blu-ray and has since been available for online streaming rentals and purchases through Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. The original theatrical cut is available to stream in HD on those same services and was released as a Manufactured On Demand DVD in the U.S. in March 2020 by Paramount. In May 2022, &quot;The Warriors&quot; received another release through [imprint] on Blu-ray in Australia, which included not only the &quot;Ultimate Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, but also the theatrical version, which had not seen a Blu-ray release before. In December 2023, &quot;The Warriors&quot; was released for the first time on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray by Arrow Video with both theatrical and director&#x27;s cut included.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack, featuring music by Barry De Vorzon, Joe Walsh, and others, was released on the A&amp;M label in March 1979.

==In other media==
===Merchandise===
In 2005, Mezco Toyz released several action figures based on characters from the film, including Swan, Cleon, Cochise, Ajax, Luther, and a Baseball Fury.

=== Video games ===
A fighting video game of the same name based on the film was released by Rockstar Games in October 2005. The game expands upon the story of the film, featuring 13 levels that take place before the film&#x27;s events and depict the Warriors&#x27; rise to power. The final five levels directly adapt the events of the film, with only a few changes. Several of the actors from the film returned to reprise their roles. In 2005, Roger Hill (who portrayed Cyrus in the film) sued Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive for royalty fees, claiming the video game used his voice and depiction of his likeness without his consent or paying him royalties. Take-Two asserted its claims that the voice and likeness of Cyrus were a component of its licensing agreement for the film. Roger Hill died in 2014 with the case unresolved.

In 2009, Warner Bros. Entertainment released a beat &#x27;em up scroller game based on the film, titled &quot;The Warriors: Street Brawl&quot;.

===Comic books===
In 2009, Dabel Brothers Productions published a five-issue comic book adaption of the film. In 2013, Dynamite Entertainment published &quot;The Warriors: Jail Break&quot;, a four-issue mini series which takes place several months after the events portrayed in the film and involve the gang&#x27;s attempt to break Ajax from prison.

===Television series===
In July 2016, Joe and Anthony Russo announced they were working with Paramount Television and Hulu for a re-imagined &quot;Warriors&quot; TV series; Frank Baldwin was signed on to write the series. In June 2018, development of the series was moved to Netflix.

=== Board game ===
&quot;The Warriors: Come Out to Play&quot; board game was published by Funko Games in 2022.

=== Stage musical and concept album ===
In August 2023, it was reported that Lin-Manuel Miranda had begun work on a stage musical adaptation of the Sol Yurick novel that provided the basis for the film. In August 2024 it was reported that the project was in fact to produce a concept album with Eisa Davis, adapted from the film. The album, &quot;Warriors&quot;, was released on 18 October 2024. Original film cast members James Remar and David Patrick Kelly contributed vocals to the album, with Remar voicing the cop who arrests Ajax, and Kelly voicing the officer who kills Fox. In December 2024, Lin-Manuel Miranda officially announced via an interview with The New York Times, that he, alongside Eisa Davis would be adapting the well-received concept album into a full stage show. &quot;People really like it, but because we&#x27;re such a visual culture, everyone said to me and Eisa &#x27;OK, when can we see it?&#x27;&quot; he shared. &quot;So I think at the top of the year, Eisa and I will just start having conversations about how to adapt that to the stage.&quot;

==Possible remake==
Tony Scott had planned a remake of the film. In an interview in 2005, Scott said that the remake would be set in modern-day Los Angeles; gangs such as the Baseball Furies and Hi-Hats would not be included in the remake. After the death of Scott, Mark Neveldine showed interest in directing a remake.

<text>A matchbook is a small paperboard folder (known as a matchcover) enclosing a quantity of matches and having a coarse striking surface on the exterior. The folder is opened to access the matches, which are attached in a comb-like arrangement and must be torn away before use in contrast to a matchbox where the matches are loosely packed in the interior tray.

The exterior of the matchcover is usually imprinted with a producer&#x27;s logo, often with artistic decorations, or serves as an advertising/promotional medium for the undertaking by which it is sold or given away. The ease of making matchcovers of different shapes also made them quite a popular cheap promotional item or anniversary souvenir.

Manufacturing of matchbooks peaked during the 1940s and 1950s, then steadily declined because of the availability of disposable lighters and various anti-smoking health campaigns. Recently, matchbooks have begun to regain some of their popularity as a &quot;retro&quot; advertising item, particularly in high-end restaurants.

Although paper matches were patented in the 1880s, an early paper match &quot;folder&quot; was patented in September 1892 by Philadelphia patent attorney Joshua Pusey. However, the matchbook as we know it, with the striking surface on the outside, was patented a few weeks later by Charles Bowman of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Pusey challenged Bowman&#x27;s patent, but Bowman&#x27;s patent was upheld. Pusey sold his patent to the Diamond Match Trust in 1896 and then served as the company&#x27;s patent attorney. Bowman&#x27;s company, the American Safety Head Match Company of Lebanon, PA did not last long, and Diamond Match Co. adapted his design into their product, becoming the first mass-producer of paper matchbooks.

Collecting of matchboxes, matchbooks, match labels and other match-related items is called phillumeny.

==Matchcover==

A &quot;matchcover&quot;, or &quot;matchbook cover&quot;, is a thin cardboard covering that folds over match sticks in a &quot;book&quot; or &quot;pack&quot; of matches. Covers have been used as a form of advertising since 1894, two years after they were patented, and since then, have attracted people who enjoy the hobby of collecting. Many historians point to the Mendelson Opera as the first to use matchbooks for advertising purposes; they hand wrote their promotional information on blank matchbook covers made by the Binghamton Match Company between 1893/94. Inspired by the Opera&#x27;s innovation, Diamond Match salesman Henry Traute began approaching manufacturers to advertise their products on his company&#x27;s matches, promoting them as something that would be viewed by their users many times a day. Among the first companies to order advertising matchbooks were Pabst beer, American Tobacco Company and Wrigley&#x27;s Chewing Gum. He also encouraged his customers to give away matchbooks as a promotional item.

Collectors are known as &quot;phillumenists&quot;, or &quot;lovers of light&quot;, and include people who have a shoe box or fish bowl filled with packs from local stores and restaurants, to serious collectors with covers organized in hundreds of different topics. In 2005, there were over 1800 active collectors in The Rathkamp Matchcover Society (&quot;The Voice of the Hobby Since 1941&quot;), spread over 20 countries worldwide.

The most expensive matchbook cost $6,000 US dollars and was purchased by Kevin Saucier (USA) in Santa Ana, California, USA, on 3 July 2015. The matchbook was created for a rare Charles Lindbergh dinner celebration dated 14 June 1927. The matchbook is missing four matches but is otherwise in mint condition as the cover is generally considered the collectible grade. It is believed that &quot;The Lindbergh Matchbooks&quot; as they are known in the hobby were discarded as they were printed with the rank of Captain; with the world-famous achievement Lindbergh was promptly promoted to Colonel. It is estimated 200 of these books were handed out at a dinner in his honor at the Astor Hotel in New York City. At last count there were about 13 known to exist.

<doc id="1173580" wikidata="Q87444516" url="?curid=1173580" title="Epoxide hydrolase">
<text>Epoxide hydrolases (EHs), also known as epoxide hydratases, are enzymes that metabolize compounds that contain an epoxide residue; they convert this residue to two hydroxyl residues through an epoxide hydrolysis reaction to form diol products. Several enzymes possess EH activity. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (epoxide hydrolase 1, EH1, or mEH), soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, epoxide hydrolase 2, EH2, or cytoplasmic epoxide hydrolase), and the more recently discovered but not as yet well defined functionally, epoxide hydrolase 3 (EH3) and epoxide hydrolase 4 (EH4) are structurally closely related isozymes. Other enzymes with epoxide hydrolase activity include leukotriene A4 hydrolase, Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase, MEST (gene) (Peg1/MEST), and Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase. The hydrolases are distinguished from each other by their substrate preferences and, directly related to this, their functions.

== Classification ==

=== mEH (EH1), sEH (EH2), EH3, and EH4 isozymes ===
Humans express four epoxide hydrolase isozymes: mEH, sEH, EH3, and EH4. These isozymes are known (mEH and sEH) or presumed (EH3 and EH4) to share a common structure that includes containing an Alpha/beta hydrolase fold and a common reaction mechanism wherein they add water to epoxides to form vicinal cis (see (cis-trans isomerism); see (epoxide#Olefin (alkene) oxidation using organic peroxides and metal catalysts)) diol products. They differ, however, in subcellular location, substrate preferences, tissue expression, and/or function.

==== mEH ====
mEH is widely expressed in virtually all mammalian cells as an endoplasmic reticulum-bound (i.e. microsomal-bound) enzyme with its C terminal catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm; in some tissues, however, mEH has been found bound to the cell surface plasma membrane with its catalytic domain facing the extracellular space. The primary function of mEH is to convert potentially toxic xenobiotics and other compounds that possess epoxide residues (which is often due to their initial metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes to epoxides) to diols. Epoxides are highly reactive electrophilic compounds that form adducts with DNA and proteins and also cause strand breaks in DHA; in consequence, epoxides can cause gene mutations, cancer, and the inactivation of critical proteins. The diols thereby formed are usually not toxic or far less toxic than their epoxide predecessors, are readily further metabolized, and ultimately excreted in the urine. mEH also metabolizes certain epoxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) but its activity in doing this is far less than that of sEH; mEH therefore may play a minor role, compared to sEH, in limiting the bioactivity of these cell signaling compounds (see microsomal epoxide hydrolase).

==== sEH ====
sEH is widely expressed in mammalian cells as a cytosolic enzyme where it primarily serves the function of converting epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EQAs), and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (DPAs) to their corresponding diols, thereby limiting or ending their cell signaling actions; in this capacity, sEH appears to play a critical in vivo role in limiting the effects of these epoxides in animal models and possibly humans. However, sEH also metabolizes the epoxides of linoleic acid viz., Vernolic acid (leukotoxins) and Coronaric acids (isoleukotoxins) to their corresponding diols which are highly toxic in animal models and possibly humans (see Vernolic acid#Toxicity, Coronaric acid#toxicity, and soluble epoxide hydrolase). sEH also possesses hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase activity, converting bioactive hepoxilins to their inactive trioxilin products (see below section &quot;Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase&quot;).

==== EH3 ====
Human EH3 is a recently characterized protein with epoxy hydrolase activity for metabolizing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and vernolic acids (leukotoxins) to their corresponding diols; in these capacities they may thereby limit the cell signaling activity of the EETs and contribute to the toxicity of the leukotoxins. mRNA for EH3 is most strongly expressed in the lung, skin, and upper gastrointestinal tract tissues of mice. The function of EH3 in humans, mice, or other mammals has not yet been determined although the gene for EH3 has been validated as being hypermethylated on CpG sites in its promoter region in human prostate cancer tissue, particularly in the tissues of more advanced or morphologically-based (i.e. Gleason score) more aggressive cancers; this suggests that the gene silencing of EH3 due to this hypermethylation may contribute to the onset and/or progression of prostate cancer. Similar CpG site hypermethylations in the promoter of for the EH3 gene have been validated for other cancers. This promoter methylation pattern, although not yet validated, was also found in human malignant melanoma.

==== EH4 ====
The gene for EH4, &quot;EPHX4&quot;, is projected to encode an epoxide hydrolase closely related in amino acid sequence and structure to mEH, sEH, and EH3. The activity and function of EH4 has not yet been defined.

=== Other epoxy hydrolases ===

==== Leukotriene A4 hydrolase ====
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) acts primarily, if not exclusively, to hydrolyze leukotriene A4 (LTA4, i.e. 5S,6S-oxido-7&quot;E&quot;,9&quot;E&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatetetraenoic acid; IUPAC name 4-{(2S,3S)-3-[(1E,3E,5Z,8Z)-1,3,5,8-Tetradecatetraen-1-yl]-2-oxiranyl}butanoic acid) to its diol metabolite, leukotriene B4 (LTB4, i.e. 5&quot;S&quot;,12&quot;R&quot;-dihydroxy-6&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;E&quot;,10&quot;E&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-icosatetraenoic acid; IUPA name 5S,6Z,8E,10E,12R,14Z)-5,12-Dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid). LTB4 is an important recruiter and activator of leukocytes involved in mediation in inflammatory responses and diseases. The enzyme also possess aminopeptidase activity, degrading, for example, the leukocyte chemotactic factor tripeptide, Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP); the function of the aminopeptidase activity of LTA4AH is unknown but has been proposed to be involved in limiting inflammatory reactions caused by this or other aminopeptidase-susceptible peptides.

==== Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase ====
(Cholesterol epoxide hydrolase or ChEH), is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and to a lesser extent plasma membrane of various cell types but most highly express in liver. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of certain 3-hydroxyl-5,6-epoxides of cholesterol to their 3,5,6-trihydroxy products (see Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase). The function of ChEH is unknown.

==== Peg1/MEST ====
The substrate(s) and physiological function of Peg1/MEST are not known; however, the protein may play a role in mammalian development and abnormalities in its expression by its gene (PEG1/MEST)by, for example, loss of Genomic imprinting, overexpression, or promoter switching, has been linked to certain types of cancer and tumors in humans such as invasive cervical cancer, uterine leiomyomas, and cancers of the breast, lung, and colon (see MEST (gene)).

==== Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase ====
Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase or hepoxilin hydrolase is currently best defined as an enzyme activity that converts the biologically active monohydroxy-epoxide metabolites of arachidonic acid hepoxilin A3s and hepoxilin B3s to essentially inactive trihydroxy products, the trioxilins. That is, hepoxilin A3s (8-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5&quot;Z&quot;,9&quot;E&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acid) are metabolized to trioxilin A3s (8,11,12-trihydroxy-5&quot;Z&quot;,9&quot;E&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acids) and hepoxilins B3s (10-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acids) are metabolized to trioxilin B3s (10,11,12-trihydroxy-5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acids). However, this activity has not been characterized at the purified protein or gene level and recent work indicate that sEH readily metabolizes an hepoxilin A3 to a trioxilin A3 and that hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase activity is due to sEH, at least as it is detected in mouse liver.

==== &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; ====
&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the causative agent of tuberculosis, expresses at least six different forms of epoxide hydrolase (forms A-F). The structure of epoxide hydrolase B reveals that the enzyme is a monomer and contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. In addition to providing insights into the enzyme mechanism, this hydrolase currently serves as a platform for rational drug design of potent inhibitors. In particular, urea based inhibitors have been developed. These inhibitors directly target the catalytic cavity. It is hypothesized that the structure of epoxide hydrolase B may allow for drug design to inhibit all other &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; hydrolases as long as they contain similar alpha/beta folds. The structure of hydrolase B contains a cap domain, which is hypothesized to regulate the active site of the hydrolase. Furthermore, Asp104, His333, and Asp302 form the catalytic triad of the protein and is critical to function of the protein. At present, other structures of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; hydrolase have not been solved. Model studies on pharmacological susceptibility of these epoxide hydrolases continue.

<doc id="1173582" wikidata="Q7628685" url="?curid=1173582" title="Stump v. Sparkman">
<text>Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978), is the leading United States Supreme Court decision on judicial immunity. It involved an Indiana judge who was sued by a young woman who had been sterilized without her knowledge as a minor in accordance with the judge&#x27;s order. The Supreme Court held that the judge was immune from being sued for issuing the order because it was issued as a judicial function. The case has been called one of the most controversial in recent Supreme Court history.

==Facts==
In 1971, Judge Harold D. Stump granted a mother&#x27;s petition to have a tubal ligation performed on her 15-year-old daughter, who the mother alleged was &quot;somewhat retarded&quot;. The petition was granted the same day that it was filed. The judge did not hold a hearing to receive evidence or appoint a lawyer to protect the daughter&#x27;s interests. The daughter underwent the surgery a week later, having been told that she was to have her appendix removed.

The daughter married two years later. Failing to become pregnant, she learned that she had been sterilized during the 1971 operation. The daughter and her husband sued the judge and others associated with the sterilization in federal district court.

The district court found that the judge was immune from suit. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, holding that the judge had lost his immunity because he failed to observe &quot;elementary principles of due process&quot; when he ordered the sterilization. Finally, in 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-3 decision, reversed the Court of Appeals, announcing a test for deciding when judicial immunity should apply and holding that the judge could not be sued.

==Background==

On July 9, 1971, Ora Spitler McFarlin of Auburn, Indiana, through her attorney Warren G. Sunday, presented a petition to Judge Harold D. Stump of the DeKalb County Circuit Court asking to have her 15-year-old daughter, Linda Spitler, surgically sterilized. The petition alleged that the daughter was &quot;somewhat retarded&quot;, was associating with &quot;older youth and young men&quot; and that it would be in the daughter&#x27;s best interest to undergo a tubal ligation &quot;to prevent unfortunate circumstances.&quot;

Judge Stump signed the requested order &quot;ex parte&quot; the same day that he received the petition. The daughter had no notice of it. No guardian &quot;ad litem&quot; was appointed to represent her interest, and no hearing was held. Neither the petition nor the order was filed with the clerk of the circuit court, nor did the order cite any statutory authority for the action being taken.

On July 15, Linda Spitler entered DeKalb Memorial Hospital, just four blocks from her home. She was told that she was to have her appendix removed. The next day a tubal ligation was performed on her by Dr. John H. Hines, assisted by Dr. Harry M. Covell, and anesthesiologist Dr. John C. Harvey.

In 1973, Linda Spitler married Leo Sparkman. Failing to become pregnant, she learned from Hines in 1975 that she had been sterilized. The Sparkmans then brought an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) for alleged deprivation of Linda Sparkman&#x27;s civil rights against Ora McFarlin, her attorney, Judge Stump, the doctors who performed the operation and the hospital where it was performed. Leo Sparkman asserted a pendent claim under state law for loss of potential fatherhood. Linda Sparkman also asserted pendent state claims for assault and battery and medical malpractice. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.

Linda Sparkman later changed her name to Jamie Renae Coleman and co-authored a 2003 book, &quot;The Blanket She Carried&quot;, with her friend Paula Headley.

===Lower courts===

The district court judge, Jesse E. Eschbach, dismissed the case, holding that the only state action, which was necessary to the federal claims, was Judge Stump&#x27;s approval of the petition and that he was &quot;clothed with absolute judicial immunity&quot;, thereby cutting off the claims against the other defendants as well. The Sparkmans appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which reversed the dismissal.

Judicial immunity is the principle in which &quot;a judge [has] complete protection from personal liability for exercising judicial functions&quot;. Applying the doctrine of judicial immunity adopted by the U. S. Supreme Court in &quot;Bradley v. Fisher&quot; in 1871 and held applicable to § 1983 actions in &quot;Pierson v. Ray&quot; in 1967, Judge Luther M. Swygert, writing for himself and Judges Harlington Wood Jr., and William G. East, found that immunity is available only when a judge has jurisdiction over the subject-matter of a case and that it is not available when he acts in &quot;clear absence of all jurisdiction.&quot; Although Indiana statute law permitted the sterilization of institutionalized persons under certain circumstances, it provided for the right to notice, the opportunity to defend and the right to appeal. The Court of Appeals found no basis in statutory or common law for a court to order the sterilization of a minor child simply upon a parent&#x27;s petition. It also held that Stump&#x27;s action could not be justified as a valid exercise of the power of courts to fashion new common law. Concluding, Judge Swygert wrote:

Even if defendant Stump had not been foreclosed under the Indiana statutory scheme from fashioning a new common law remedy in this case, we would still find his action to be an illegitimate exercise of his common law power because of his failure to comply with elementary principles of procedural due process. Here a juvenile was ordered sterilized without the taking of the slightest steps to ensure that her rights were protected. Not only was the plaintiff not given representation, she was not even told what was happening to her. She was afforded no opportunity to contest the validity of her mother&#x27;s allegations or to have a higher court examine whether the substance of those allegations, even if true, warranted her sterilization. Finally, the petition and order were never filed in court. This kind of purported justice does not fall within the categories of cases at law or in equity.

Stump and his co-defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted &quot;certiorari&quot; and reversed the Court of Appeals.

==The holding==

Associate Justice Byron White, writing for the five-member majority, disagreed with the determination by the Court of Appeals that there was a &quot;clear absence of all jurisdiction&quot; for Judge Stump to consider Ora McFarlin&#x27;s petition, noting that Indiana law gave circuit courts &quot;original exclusive jurisdiction in all cases at law and in equity&quot; and jurisdiction over &quot;all other causes, matters and proceedings where exclusive jurisdiction thereof is not conferred by law upon some other court, board or officer.&quot; Justice White acknowledged an intervening decision of the Indiana Court of Appeals in 1975 that held that a parent has no common-law right to have a minor child sterilized; but he reasoned that when presented with a petition like Ora McFarlin&#x27;s, an Indiana circuit judge &quot;should deny it on its merits rather than dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction.&quot; Noting that Judge Swygert found no Indiana law that authorized Judge Stump&#x27;s action, Justice White observed:

...[I]t is more significant that there was no Indiana statute and no case law in 1971 prohibiting a circuit court, a court of general jurisdiction, from considering a petition of the type presented to Judge Stump.

Addressing Judge Swygert&#x27;s assertion that even if Judge Stump had jurisdiction he was deprived of immunity because of his failure to observe elementary principles of procedural due process, Justice White countered:

A judge is absolutely immune from liability for his judicial acts even if his exercise of authority is flawed by the commission of grave procedural errors. The Court made this point clear in &quot;Bradley&quot;, 13 Wall., at 357, where it stated &quot;[T]his erroneous manner in which [the court&#x27;s] jurisdiction was exercised, however it may have affected the validity of the act, did not make it any less a judicial act; nor did it render the defendant liable to answer in damages for it at the suit of the plaintiff, as though the court had proceeded without having any jurisdiction whatever...

===Test of a &quot;judicial act&quot;===

The majority opinion went on to decide that the factors determining whether an act by a judge is a judicial act &quot;relate to the nature of the act itself&quot;:

#whether it is a function normally performed by a judge; and
#whether the parties dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.

In the view of the majority, Judge Stump&#x27;s action passed this test. Even if his decision was erroneous, it was within his jurisdiction to consider Ora McFarlin&#x27;s petition. Moreover, the parties dealt with Judge Stump in his capacity as a judge, not as a private individual. Accordingly, he could not be held liable for the consequences of his actions, even if they were arguably tragic.

==The dissent==

===Justice Stewart&#x27;s dissent===

Associate Justice Potter Stewart entered a vigorous dissent. Agreeing that judges of general jurisdiction enjoy absolute immunity for their judicial acts, he wrote, &quot;...what Judge Stump did...was beyond the pale of anything that could sensibly be called a judicial act.&quot; Stating that it was &quot;factually untrue&quot; that what Judge Stump did was an act &quot;normally performed by a judge&quot;, he wrote &quot;...there is no reason to believe that such an act has ever been performed by any other Indiana judge, either before or since.&quot;

Justice Stewart also denounced it as &quot;legally unsound&quot; to rule that Judge Stump had acted in a &quot;judicial capacity&quot;. &quot;A judge is not free, like a loose cannon&quot;, he wrote, &quot;to inflict indiscriminate damage whenever he announces that he is acting in his judicial capacity.&quot;

Concluding, Justice Stewart argued that the majority misapplied the law of the Pierson case:
Not one of the considerations...summarized in the Pierson opinion was present here. There was no &quot;case,&quot; controversial or otherwise. There were no litigants. There was and could be no appeal. And there was not even the pretext of principled decision making. The total absence of any of these normal attributes of a judicial proceeding convinces me that the conduct complained of in this case was not a judicial act.

===Justice Powell&#x27;s dissent===

Joining in Justice Stewart&#x27;s opinion, Justice Lewis Powell filed a separate dissent that emphasized what he called &quot;...the central feature of this case - Judge Stump&#x27;s preclusion of any possibility for the vindication of respondents&#x27; rights elsewhere in the judicial system.&quot; Continuing, he wrote:

Underlying the Bradley immunity...is the notion that private rights can be sacrificed in some degree to the achievement of the greater public good deriving from a completely independent judiciary, because there exist alternative forums and methods for vindicating those rights.

But where a judicial officer acts in a manner that precludes all resort to appellate or other judicial remedies that otherwise would be available, the underlying assumption of the Bradley doctrine is inoperative.
== Legacy ==
The decision has been called one of the most controversial decisions in Supreme Court history.

2007 marked the centennial of the 1907 Indiana sterilization law, the first of its kind in the world. Although Linda Sparkman was not sterilized under any of the eugenics laws still on the books in Indiana in 1971, she was invited to unveil a state historic marker describing the original law on April 12, 2007, in Indianapolis. Indiana repealed all laws concerning sterilization of the mentally ill in 1974.

<doc id="1173584" wikidata="Q2529048" url="?curid=1173584" title="Book of Imaginary Beings">
<text>The Book of Imaginary Beings was written by Jorge Luis Borges with Margarita Guerrero and published in 1957 under the original Spanish title &quot;Manual de zoología fantástica&quot; (&quot;Handbook of fantastic zoology&quot;). It contains descriptions of mythical beasts from folklore and literature. In 1967 the authors published an expanded edition retitled as &quot;El libro de los seres imaginarios&quot;. Borges collaborated on the first English translation, which was praised upon its publication in 1969. 

== Contents ==
Although a work of fiction, the book is situated in a tradition of paper museums, bestiaries, and natural history writing. In the preface, Borges states that the book is to be read &quot;as with all miscellanies... not... straight through... Rather we would like the reader to dip into the pages at random, just as one plays with the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope&quot;; and that &quot;legends of men taking the shapes of animals&quot; have been omitted.

Though Borges conducted research for the book, he also fabricated sources and invented details (and in the case of the peryton, a whole creature). As translator Andrew Hurley writes, &quot;The nature of Borges’ erudition, creativity, and sense of fun is such that it has been simply impossible to ferret out all the originals, where originals in fact ever existed (some of his “quotations” are almost certainly apocrypha, put-ons).&quot;

== Versions ==
The original 1957 publication of &quot;Manual de zoología fantástica&quot; contained eighty-two entries. Thirty-four additional entries were added to the retitled second edition. While collaborating on the 1969 English translation, Borges revised many of the original entries and added another four, bringing the total count to 120. 

In 2005, Penguin published an illustrated edition with a new English translation of the 116 entry 1967 edition as part of its series of Classics Deluxe editions.

=== Original editions ===

* &quot;Manual de zoología fantástica&quot;. Mexico D.F.: Fondo de Cultura Económica , 1957
* &quot;El libro de los seres imaginarios&quot;. Buenos Aires: Editorial Kier, S.A., 1967

=== English translations ===

* &quot;The Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;. Norman Thomas di Giovanni (tr.). E.P. Dutton, 1969.
* &quot;The Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;. Andrew Hurley (tr.), Peter Sís (illus.). Viking Penguin, 2005.

== Reception ==
A review from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the book, describing it as &quot;perfect foils for classic Borgesian musings on everything from biblical etymology to the underworld, giving the creatures particularly vivid and perfectly scaled shape&quot;. Reviewing the book for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caspar Henderson stated that the book was brief but also a &quot;map of the endless labyrinth of human imagination and its contents&quot; that was &quot;dense and deep&quot;. The reviewer also commented that the entries on legends were &quot;delightful&quot;. Benjamin DeMott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; also complimented the book, stating that it was &quot;an amusing tribute to the human gift for seeing the invisible and debating whether it whistles&quot;. An article in &quot;Journal of Modern Literature,&quot; written by Melanie Nicholson, reported that some critics described the book as a &quot;curious but unoriginal compilation of already-told tale&quot;. However, Nicholson stated that it was also &quot;one worthy of serious consideration&quot;.

== Influence ==

Many writers have been influenced by &quot;The Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;; this is especially apparent in the way that many of Borges&#x27;s fabrications are repeated as accurate representations of folklore in later bestiaries and books on fantastical creatures.

British weird fiction author China Miéville credits Borges for inspiring &quot;The Tain&quot;, his 2002 fantasy novella, which features &quot;imagos&quot; that resemble the Fauna of Mirrors entry in &quot;The Book of Imaginary Beings.&quot;

The title of Caspar Henderson&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&quot; is a reference to Borges&#x27;s book. Cuban composer and classical guitarist Leo Brouwer also titled a 2018 album &quot;El Libro de los Seres Imaginarios&quot; after Borges&#x27;s book.

<text>Dezful (; pronounced ) is a city in the Central District of Dezful County, Khuzestan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==History==
Dezful is one of the oldest cities in the Khuzestan province. According to Walther Hinz excavations, Awan (capital of the first Elam empire) was located in Dezful.

The name Dezfūl is believed to be associated with a Sasanian bridge constructed over the Āb-e Dez by Šāpūr II. The Sasanians also built a fortress in close proximity to protect the bridge. This area, encompassing the bridge and the fortress, eventually evolved into the city of Dež-Pol or Dezfūl, although this name was not commonly used until the 12th century.
In the 10th century, the writer Eṣṭaḵrī referred to it as Qanṭarat-al-Andāmeš. It was also known as Qaṣr al-Rūnāš. The stone foundation of the bridge is still visible, while the upper part underwent several brick reconstructions during the early Islamic, Saljuq, and Qajar periods. In the 14th century, Ḥamd-Allāh Mostāwfī described it as 520 paces long and 15 paces wide, with forty-two arches. Šaraf-al-Dīn Yazdī, who visited the area in 795/1393, also provided a detailed description.

According to George Curzon, who visited the area in the late 19th century, the principal local industry in Dezfūl was indigo, with 120 factories in the town. The cultivation of indigo was introduced in the early 19th century. Dezfūl was also renowned for its fine reed pens.

==Etymology==
The name Dezful has been derived from the two words &quot;dej&quot; (fortress) + &quot;pul&quot; (bridge), which in combination could stand for &#x27;the bridge to the fortress&#x27; or &#x27;fortified bridge&#x27; in Persian language. The original name of the city was Dezhpul, but after the Muslim conquest of Persia, the city was renamed Dezful, since the Arabic language does not have &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;zh&#x27; sounds. The city is also known as Dizful and Desful.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
The people of Dezful city speak Dezfuli dialect and Bakhtiari dialect respectively

The people of Dezful, known as Dezfuli, Dezfoolian or Dezfulian, speak Lory dialects of Dezfuli – a dialect distinct to Dezful – and Shushtari, a dialect of Shushtar that is sometimes considered to be one of the most archaic Lory dialects. These dialects belong to the Southwest Iranian language group. However, they differ significantly from standard Persian in terms of pronunciation, word formation, and vocabulary. The most notable distinctions are found in the structure of verbs. Although they share some similarities with nearby Lor dialects, they are still distinct. The differences between Dezfuli and Shushtari are mainly a result of variations in the detailed sound patterns of the language.

Historically, Dezful was home to a Mandaean community for many centuries. One of Dezful&#x27;s best-known residents was the Mandaean priest Ram Zihrun.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 228,507 in 55,711 households. The following census in 2011 counted 248,380 people in 66,715 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 264,709 people in 78,348 households.

==Geography==
Dezful is 650 kilometers away from the national capital of Tehran and 155 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Ahvaz. The city is located 300 kilometres from the Persian Gulf and is at an altitude of 143 meters.

The city lies at the foot of the Zagros Mountains and has a history that dates back to the Sassanian era. The area around Dezful has been home to civilizations for 5000 years.

Dezful sits close to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains on the main north-south highway from Tehran to Ahvaz, the provincial capital of Khuzestan. The main rail line from Tehran to the Persian Gulf is 15 km (9 mi) from Dezful, on the opposite side of the Dez River.

===Climate===
Dezful has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;) with extremely hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is higher than most of southern Iran, but is almost exclusively confined to the period from November to April, sometimes with thunderstorms, though on occasions it can exceed per month or per year. Dust is quite common in the region and happens most frequently in summer.

Snowfall in this city is a very rare event. But in 2020, for the first time, the city of Dezful witnessed snowfall.

==Economy==
Sugarcane, which has been cultivated in the Dezfūl region for more than a thousand years, is still an important economic factor; a modern sugar refinery with a capacity of more than 300 tons has been built in Haft Tappa near the town of Dezfūl. Other major agricultural products of the šahrestān include wheat, barley, clover, alfalfa, sesame, maize, and grass peas; sheep are the most important livestock

===Artisan work===
The Dezful reed pen is one of the important commercial products that has been cultivated in Dezful for the past three hundred years and is recognized as the finest reed pen at the national and global levels . In the past, the Dezful reed pen was exported to countries like Turkey and China, and it is still exported to most cities in Iran.

Dezful is also known for its handmade wooden tools, including hookah bases, hookahs, candlesticks, coat hangers, and salt shakers. Additionally, the city&#x27;s handicraft traditions encompass metalwork, such as varshoosazi (crafting items from a Nickle Silver), engraving on gold and silver, and goldsmithing. 

In the varshoosazi workshops of Dezful&#x27;s old bazaar, artisans craft tools for tea drinking and other purposes. The craft of varshoosazi (the making of varsho items) in Iran dates back to the Safavid era, but its peak occurred during the Qajar period and continued into the Pahlavi dynasty. Varsho metal sheets, also known as German silver or Nickle Silver, were imported from Germany, particularly from Poland. This is why Iranian artisans named the metal varsho(Warsaw), after the city of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and the craft became known as varshoosazi. Artisans from Isfahan, Borujerd, and Dezful were the first to learn how to produce varsho crafts by observing Russian samovars and other products. The varshoosazi industry reached its height in Iran, particularly in the cities of Dezful and Borujerd, during the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. Many individuals adopted the surname Varshoochi or Varshabi in Dezful because it was closely associated with their profession as varsho craftsmen.

==Higher Education==
Dezful is home to various higher education institutions, each offering various academic and professional programs. These institutions have played an integral role in promoting education, research, and professional development in khuzetsan, significantly contributing to Dezful&#x27;s academic and cultural richness.

==Historical monuments==

In an area with a history that extends back to ancient civilization, the city houses a bridge that dates back to 300 AD.

==Transportation==
There are direct flights from Tehran to Dezful (and reverse) at least twice a day. There are also weekly flights from Dezful to Mashhad (mawhad or mašhad). Dezful can also be reached by the Iranian railways.

Buses are available from almost all Iranian major cities to Dezful or one of its adjacent cities. Trains of the Trans-Iranian Railway serve the neighboring town of Andimeshk.

<doc id="1173588" wikidata="Q7621045" url="?curid=1173588" title="Straight University">
<text>Straight University (known as Straight College after 1915) was an American historically black college that operated between 1868 and 1934 in New Orleans, Louisiana. After struggling with financial difficulties, it was merged with New Orleans University to form Dillard University.

==History==
Responding to the post-Civil War need to educate newly freed African Americans in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the surrounding region, the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church founded Straight University on June 12, 1868.

Straight University received its name as recognition for Seymour Straight&#x27;s initial endowment gift. Straight was a wealthy cheese manufacturer from Hudson, Ohio. In 1915, the name &quot;Straight University&quot; was changed to Straight College, which more accurately represented the scope of the school&#x27;s curriculum and program. Missionary work was a core concern, which extended from New Orleans to Africa.

It was a college that admitted students regardless of their backgrounds, advertising in 1871:The old and young can enter at this Institution any day, no distinction made in regard to race or color. The design of the Institution, is to furnish opportunities to those wishing a rapid, thorough and practical business education [...]. Parties having ordinary ability, who have entirely neglected their education now have the opportunity to qualify themselves for almost any position in the State, in an incredible short time. From two to three months is all that requires to complete the commeral [&quot;sic&quot;] course. Terms duced to suit the times [&quot;sic&quot;].Throughout its history, Straight offered courses of study ranging from elementary- to college-level courses in music and theology. In 1934, after struggling with financial difficulties during the Great Depression, Straight College was merged with New Orleans University to form Dillard University.

==Law department==
Straight University also offered professional training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886. Its graduates participated in local and national Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era civil rights struggles. For example, Louis André Martinet, an 1876 graduate of Straight University Law School, published &quot;The Crusader&quot;—a civil rights daily; co-founded the &quot;Comité des Citoyens&quot; (Citizens&#x27; Committee) in New Orleans, which worked for civil rights; and played a significant role in setting up the challenge to segregation of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, a landmark Supreme Court case. His classmate Dan Desdunes joined him in this effort before moving to North Omaha, Nebraska, to become a band leader.

The Law department is historically notable as an integrated institution where blacks and whites were trained side by side. &quot;It is an interesting fact of our 50 law graduates, 35 have been white.&quot; The school struggled to provide its law students with a proper research library. The students typically met for classes in the law professors&#x27; offices.

In 1886, Straight discontinued the Law Department. It began to focus primarily on liberal arts, industrial arts, and teacher training.

==Campus==
The campus faced Canal Street, occupying the block between Tonti and Rocheblave streets backed by Gasquet (now Cleveland Avenue). After the university was merged with the newly created Dillard University, the campus buildings served as a school and YWCA for nearly two decades. They were demolished in 1950.

==Notable alumni==
Some graduates brought education and medical care to African Americans during the early part of the 20th century. Physician James W. Ames, for example, founded the first hospital for blacks in Detroit in 1910. He created Dunbar Hospital for physicians and patients of color, as they were unable to practice in or be admitted to Detroit hospitals operated by whites.

Nellie A. Ramsey Leslie became a pioneer teacher in Indian Territory and later in Texas.
Other notable alumni include Tom Yarborough, the first Black mayor in California; P.B.S. Pinchback (second African-American lieutenant governor of Louisiana and first African-American governor of any U.S. state); Ernest Lyon (educator and U.S. Ambassador to Liberia); Mary Booze (first African American to sit on the Republican National Committee, serving from Mississippi from 1924 to 1948); Alice Dunbar Nelson, forerunner of the Harlem Renaissance; and Theodore K. Lawless, a dermatologist and philanthropist.

<text>Texhnolyze (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese experimental anime television series animated by Madhouse and directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki. Set in the fictional city of Lux, the story focuses on Ichise, a stoic prize fighter who loses an arm and a leg after offending an unnamed figure. Written by Chiaki J. Konaka, with original character design by Yoshitoshi Abe, the series was produced by Yasuyuki Ueda and was broadcast on Fuji Television and its affiliates from April to September 2003.

==Plot==

&quot;Texhnolyze&quot; follows Ichise, an underground fighter whose arm and leg were severed after he displeased an unnamed, presumably influential, man. He is brought back from the brink of death by Eriko &quot;Doc&quot; Kaneda, who replaces his lost limbs with prosthetics through a process known as &quot;texhnolyzation&quot;, the process enabled by the fictional material &quot;raffia&quot;, mined from underneath Lux and which serves as the city&#x27;s only export commodity and its raison d&#x27;être. Doc tells Ichise that the limbs are special prototypes of her own construction, and that they contain the DNA of Ichise&#x27;s deceased mother, the last bits of her remains that she incorporated into prosthetics&#x27; circuits. Through his connection to Doc, Ichise becomes entangled in the strife between the three major factions battling for control of Lux: the Organo, a crime syndicate of &quot;professionals&quot; who are the closest thing to a government in the city of Lux; the Salvation Union, a populist group that foments a revolution against the Organo&#x27;s rule; and the Raccan, a collection of young itinerants with texhnolyzed limbs who wield them as weapons for personal gain.

Soon, Ichise meets a mysterious young girl, Ran, a seer from the nearby village of Gabe who has the power to see possible futures. He also crosses paths with Kazuho Yoshi, a traveler &quot;from above&quot; who is inciting chaos within the city by instigating confrontations between the existing factions. Yoshi wants Lux in utter chaos and violence to sustain his essence that was slowly reduced on the surface. When Yoshi tries to kill Onishi, the putative head of Organo and a former mentor of Ichise, Ichise manages to eliminate him with his powerful prosthetics. As the situation in Lux deteriorates, strange new enemies - &quot;The Class&quot;, an exclusionary group of elites who live in a highly developed enclave outside of Lux, appear trying to convert the three factions to their &quot;cause&quot;. These texhnolyzed &quot;Shapes&quot; are controlled by Kano, a leader of &quot;The Class&quot;, a monstrosity produced by incestuous reproduction over multiple generations.

To stop Kano&#x27;s plans to invade the surface world after conquering Lux, Ichise and Doc travel to the former, while the factions of Lux unite to fight against their common enemy, &quot;The Class&quot; and their minions - &quot;Shapes&quot;. They make their way through miles of empty idyllic countryside before encountering an administrative center, empty save for the assortment of randomly stacked furniture and radios endlessly repeating equally random news broadcasts from an undetermined time. They discover the inhabitants of the surface, the &quot;theonormals&quot;, having lost all desire to live yet kept alive and maintained by the futuristic technology of the surface world. Having resigned themselves to extinction, the &quot;theonormals&quot; ignore the warnings of Ichise and Doc, choosing to wait for their eventual demise.

Aboveground, Doc and Ichise stumble into an empty movie theater, where they watch a newsreel which explains that, centuries ago, the people of the surface, plagued by terrorism and violence, rounded up the &quot;undesirables&quot; of the society and sent them underground to build and live in the city of Lux. Doc, driven to despair by the discovery that the &quot;theonormals&quot; of the surface world have no interest in affecting her future, commits suicide in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Ichise wanders through the city engaging the &quot;theonormals&quot; in obscure conversations. While the latter speak of death as a welcome relief, Ichise decides on a return to Lux, and coming across the fading homunculus of his father, apologizes for holding him responsible for mother&#x27;s death.

Although Lux&#x27;s main entrance was destroyed by a &quot;theonormal&quot; preventing the &quot;Shapes&quot; from reaching the surface world, Ichise is shown the alternative entrance by a mysterious hologram who finally explains to him the plight of the surface people. Arriving at this entry point, Ichise encounters three &quot;Shapes&quot;, among them Haruhiko Tooyama, another former mentor of his in the Organo. Despairing of the bitter end, and now reduced to a &quot;Shape&quot;, Tooyama kills his two companions before challenging Ichise to a duel. Ichise beheads Tooyama to spare him the horrific fate of being rooted to the ground to vegetate as a useless trunk devoid of life and reason. Before expiring, Tooyama thanks him, and Ichise continues on his final journey down to Lux.

In the city, all traces of resistance have been broken. The now useless &quot;Shapes&quot; are now rooted to the ground, the life-support systems keeping their organs, attached to the exoskeletons, barely alive. A flashback details how the citizens of Lux fell to the onslaught of the &quot;Shapes&quot;, with only a few scattered groups of human survivors still clinging to a forlorn hope of salvation. While Ichise makes his way through the city, following phantom images of Ran and encountering former colleagues who are now &#x27;rooted&#x27; to the ground as &quot;Shapes&quot;, the power systems that kept up the artificial light begin to fail, plunging Lux into darkness. While making his way to the Opera House to confront Kano, Ichise witnesses a berserk mob kill Onishi, the last leader of Organo. In a rage he decimates the mob but is himself repeatedly injured in the fight.

In the Opera House, Ichise finds Kano alone surrounded by the multitude of rotting rooted &quot;Shapes&quot;, next to the bas-relief of Ran&#x27;s head. Ran killed herself rather than live in the world created by the demented Kano, who reveals his solipsistic belief in his own exclusive sanity, his work of transmogrifying the &quot;Shapes&quot; into living plants in order to keep them alive indefinitely until such time that humanity overcomes their violent urges. Enraged at Ran&#x27;s death, Ichise decapitates Kano.

Alone on an abandoned rooftop, Ichise begins to deteriorate as the power systems controlling his texhnolyzed limbs fail. Dying, he accepts the inevitability of his end, as the artificial limbs suddenly come to life and briefly flash a crude drawing of a flower which Ran gave him long time ago. He smiles and slowly slumps, succumbing to his injuries.

==Characters==
:
:Ichise is the main protagonist of Texhnolyze. He rarely speaks, and is mostly passive in his behavior, but occasionally lashes out violently. First appearing as an unlicensed boxer, throughout the series he pursues a sense of meaning as he becomes increasingly involved in the conflict between the various factions of Lux.
:
:Ran, a young child, is a seer from the neighboring city of Gabe. She is primarily seen selling orchids while wearing a white fox mask wherever she travels. Ran has the gift of foresight, which allows her to see glimpses of the future. Unfortunately, this ability often pains her, as she is unable to change the events of the future that she sees. She has an unexplained, but profound interest in Ichise, and throughout the series she appears to help guide him.
:
:Doc is a medical specialist from the mysterious Class, a group of elite individuals who live far away from Lux. She studies the process of texhnolyzation, the fictional technology that allows humans to control prosthetic limbs easily. She provides special prototype prosthetics for Ichise to replace his missing limbs, and follows him through the plot out of an interest in both him and the effects her experimental technology have on him.
:
:Onishi is the current chairman of the Organo, and claims to hear &quot;the voice of the city&quot; speak into his mind. He is characterized as a confident man with a clear belief in his own purpose and strong willpower, who is skilled in both combat and diplomacy. Throughout the story, Onishi attempts to maintain peace with the Salvation Union and stay loyal to his organization.
:
:Shinji is the leader of the Raccan. A young, cocky man, Shinji seems to be the extent of what authority exists in the anarchistic Raccan. He often rails against the interference of the other two factions of Lux into the lives of his group, and harbors a particularly deep hatred for the Class. 
:
:Yoshii is a mysterious visitor to the city of Lux, who is first seen descending a large, industrial staircase from an unknown location. Adventurous, charismatic, and purposeful, Yoshii&#x27;s interactions with the citizens of Lux spark a series of changes that send the three factions vying for control of the society into a frenzy.

==Release==
&quot;Texhnolyze&quot; aired for twenty episodes on Fuji Television from April 16 to September 24, 2003. Two un-aired episodes were included in the DVD release. Geneon USA&#x27;s English dub of the series aired in the United States on STARZ!/Encore&#x27;s Action channel in 2006, then aired again on Funimation Channel and Funimation Channel on Demand when Funimation licensed the series from Geneon Entertainment. It also aired in Canada on G4techTV Canada&#x27;s Anime Current block in the mid-2000s. Its opening theme is &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; by the English band Juno Reactor. Japanese visual kei singer Gackt&#x27;s song &quot;Tsuki no Uta&quot; was selected as its ending theme.

<text>The cannone da 65/17 modello 13 was an artillery piece developed by Italy for use with its mountain and infantry units. The designation means 65 mm calibre gun, barrel length 17 calibres, which entered service in 1913. The designation is often shortened to cannone da 65/17.

==Description==

A lightweight design, the 65 mm gun was designed for use in difficult terrain and extreme weather conditions. The barrel had a 17 calibre length, and was designed for firing low-trajectory shots. The carriage was likewise simple in nature, consisting of a single trailing arm and solid-rim spoked wheels for horse draft. The weapon could be broken-down into five loads for transport. A simple folding gun shield was also provided in 1935.

==History==
The 65 mm gun was first accepted into service with Italian mountain troops in 1913, and it served with them throughout World War I. It was used in the Fiat 2000 heavy tank which saw action in Libya. Replacements arrived in the 1920s and the gun was transferred to the regular infantry. It was well liked by the infantry due to its minimal weight and high reliability in adverse conditions. Despite its light calibre, it served through World War II with Italian forces as a close support weapon. It was effective also mounted on truck, particularly on captured Morris CS8 in North Africa, as anti-tank artillery. Guns captured by the Germans after the Italian defeat were given the designation 6.5 cm GebK 246(i).

Some were fielded by the Ecuadorian Army during the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War.

<doc id="1173614" wikidata="Q379054" url="?curid=1173614" title="Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma">
<text>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL or ATLL) is a rare cancer of the immune system&#x27;s T-cells caused by human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). All ATL cells contain integrated HTLV-1 provirus further supporting that causal role of the virus in the cause of the neoplasm. A small number of HTLV-1 individuals progress to develop ATL with a long latency period between infection and ATL development. ATL is categorized into four subtypes: acute, smoldering, lymphoma-type, and chronic. Acute and lymphoma-type are known to particularly be aggressive with poorer prognosis.

Globally, the retrovirus HTLV-1 is estimated to infect 20 million people per year with the incidence of ATL approximately 0.05 per 100,000 per year with endemic regions such as regions of Japan, as high as 27 per 100,000 per year. However, cases have increased in non-endemic regions with highest incidence of HTLV-1 in southern/northern islands of Japan, Caribbean, Central and South America, intertropical Africa, Romania, northern Iran. ATL normally occurs around the age of 62 years but median age at diagnosis does depend on prevalence of the HTLV-1 infection in the geographic location.

Current treatment regimens for ATL are based on clinical subtype and response to initial therapy. Some therapy modalities for treatment may not be available in all countries therefore strategies differ across the world. All patients are referred to clinical trials if available. Beyond clinical trials, treatments are centered on multiagent chemotherapy, zidovudine plus interferon-a (AZT/IFN), and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).

==Signs and symptoms==
ATL is usually a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma with no characteristic histologic appearance except for a diffuse pattern and a mature T-cell phenotype. Circulating lymphocytes with an irregular nuclear contour (leukemic cells) are frequently seen. Several lines of evidence suggest that HTLV-1 causes ATL. This evidence includes the frequent isolation of HTLV-1 from patients with this disease and the detection of HTLV-1 proviral genome in ATL leukemic cells. ATL is frequently accompanied by visceral involvement, hypercalcemia, skin lesions, and lytic bone lesions. Bone invasion and osteolysis, features of bone metastases, commonly occur in the setting of advanced solid tumors, such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers, but are less common in hematologic malignancies. However, patients with HTLV–1–induced ATL and multiple myeloma are predisposed to the development of tumor-induced osteolysis and hypercalcemia. One of the striking features of ATL and multiple myeloma induced bone disease is that the bone lesions are predominantly osteolytic with little associated osteoblastic activity. In patients with ATL, elevated serum levels of IL-1, TGFβ, PTHrP, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1α), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) have been associated with hypercalcemia. Immunodeficient mice that received implants with leukemic cells from patients with ATL or HTLV–1–infected lymphocytes developed hypercalcemia and elevated serum levels of PTHrP. Most patients die within one year of diagnosis.

Infection with HTLV-1, like infection with other retroviruses, probably occurs for life and can be inferred when antibody against HTLV-1 is detected in the serum.

==Transmission==
Transmission of HTLV-1 is believed to occur from mother to child; by sexual contact; and through exposure to contaminated blood, either through blood transfusion or sharing of contaminated needles.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on clinical features and characteristic morphologic and immunophenotypic changes of malignant cells. As clinical features and prognosis can be diverse, the disease is subtype-classified into four categories according to the Shimoyama classification: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering. Normally, identification of at least 5 percent of tumor cells in peripheral blood and confirmation of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 are sufficient for diagnosis of acute, chronic, and smoldering types. For the lymphoma type, histopathologic examination by biopsy of lymph nodes may be needed.

The immunophenotype of ATLL includes positive markers such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD25, with negative markers for CD7, CD8, and cytotoxic markers. Additionally, there is partial positivity for CD30, CCR4, and FOXP3.

==Treatment==
Treatment options that have been tried include zidovudine and the CHOP regimen. Pralatrexate has also been investigated. Recently, it has been reported that the traditional glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy toward ATL is largely mediated by thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/TXNIP/VDUP1), suggesting the potential use of a TBP-2 inducer as a novel therapeutic target.

In 2021, mogamulizumab was approved for relapsed/refractor treatment of ATL in Japan.

At a medical conference in December 2013, researchers reported anywhere from 21 to 50% of ATL patients have disease expressing CD30. Although not FDA approved, treatment with CD30-targeting brentuximab vedotin in CD 30+ cases may be beneficial and supported by current NCCN guidelines.

==Epidemiology==
HTLV-1 infection in the United States appears to be rare. Although little serologic data exists, the prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among African Americans living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among African-American intravenous drug users in New Jersey, and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in New Orleans. The prevalence of infection may be increasing in this risk group. Studies of HTLV-1 antibody indicate that the virus is endemic in southern Japan, in the Caribbean, South America, and in Africa.

ATL is relatively uncommon among those infected with HTLV-1. The overall incidence of ATL is estimated at 1 per 1,500 adult HTLV-1 carriers per year. Those cases that have been reported have occurred mostly among persons from the Caribbean or African Americans from the Southeast United States (National Institutes of Health, unpublished data). There appears to be a long latent period between HTLV-1 infection and the start of ATL.

==Research==
Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation. Pralatrexate is one compound currently under investigation to treat PTCL.

<text>Bethune College is a women&#x27;s college located on Bidhan Sarani in Kolkata, India, and affiliated to the University of Calcutta. It is the oldest women&#x27;s college in India. It was established as a girls&#x27; school in 1849, and as a college in 1879.

==History==
The college was founded as the Calcutta Female School in 1849 by John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune, with the financial support of Dakshinaranjan Mukherjee. The school started in Mukherjee&#x27;s home in Baitakkhana, with 21 girls enrolled. The following year, enrolment rose to 80. In November, on a plot on the west side of Cornwallis Square, the cornerstone for a permanent school building was laid. The name &quot;Hindu Female School&quot; was inscribed on the copper-plate placed in the stone and on the ceremonial silver trowel made for the occasion. Support for the school waned after Bethune&#x27;s death in August 1851.
The government took it over in 1856, renaming it Bethune School after its founder in 1862–63. In 1879 it was developed into Bethune College, the first women&#x27;s college in India and Bethune school was Second (First being in Bhidewada Pune, by Jyotirao Phule) women&#x27;s school in whole Asia.

<text>Alassane Dramane Ouattara (; ; born 1 January 1942) is an Ivorian politician and economist who has been President of Ivory Coast (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) since 2010. An economist by profession, he worked for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Central Bank of West African States (, BCEAO), and was the Prime Minister of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire from November 1990 to December 1993, appointed to that post by then-President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. Ouattara became the president of the Rally of the Republicans (RDR), an Ivorian political party, in 1999.

==Early and personal life==
Ouattara was born on 1 January 1942, in Dimbokro in French West Africa. He is a descendant on his father&#x27;s side of the Muslim rulers of Burkina Faso, then part of the Kong Empire—also known as the Wattara (Ouattarra) Empire. Ouattara is Muslim and is a member of the Dyula people. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1965 from the Drexel Institute of Technology (now Drexel University), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ouattara then obtained both his master&#x27;s degree in economics in 1967 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1972 from the University of Pennsylvania.

Ouattara has two children, David Dramane Ouattara and Fanta Catherine Ouattara, from his first marriage to American Barbara Jean Davis. In 1991, Ouattara married Dominique Nouvian, a French Algerian-born Catholic businesswoman of maternal Jewish descent. Their wedding was held in the town hall of the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

==Career at financial institutions==
Ouattara was an economist for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. from 1968 to 1973, and afterwards he was the &quot;Chargé de Mission&quot; in Paris of the Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (West African Central Bank) from 1973 to 1975. With the BCEAO, he was then Special Advisor to the Governor and Director of Research from February 1975 to December 1982 and Vice Governor from January 1983 to October 1984. From November 1984 to October 1988 he was Director of the African Department at the IMF, and in May 1987 he additionally became Counsellor to the Managing Director at the IMF. On 28 October 1988 he was appointed as Governor of the BCEAO, and he was sworn in on 22 December 1988. Ouattara has a reputation as a hard worker, keen on transparency and good governance.

== Political career ==

===Prime minister===
In April 1990, the IMF under the Structural Adjustment Program forced the Ivorian president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, to accept Ouattara as Chairman of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Coordination of the Stabilization and Economic Recovery Programme of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. While holding that position, Ouattara also remained in his post as BCEAO Governor. He subsequently became Prime Minister of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire on 7 November 1990, still under the IMF imposition, after which Charles Konan Banny replaced him as Interim BCEAO Governor. He also held the position of Minister of Economy and Finance from October 1990 to November 1993.

While serving as prime minister, Ouattara also tried, illegally and against the constitution, to carry out presidential duties for a total of 18 months, including the period from March to December 1993, when Houphouët-Boigny was ill. Houphouët-Boigny died on 7 December 1993, and Ouattara announced his death to the nation, saying that &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire is orphaned&quot;. A brief power struggle ensued between Ouattara and Henri Konan Bédié, the president of the National Assembly, over the presidential succession in total disregard for the constitution that clearly gave Bedié the legal right to lead the country if Houphouet became unfit. Bédié prevailed and Ouattara resigned as prime minister on 9 December. Ouattara then returned to the IMF as Deputy Managing Director, holding that post from 1 July 1994 to 31 July 1999.

===1995 election===
Prior to the October 1995 presidential election, the National Assembly of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire approved an electoral code that barred candidates if either of their parents were of a foreign nationality and if they had not lived in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire for the preceding five years. It was widely thought these provisions were aimed at Ouattara. Owing to his duties with the IMF, he had not resided in the country since 1990. Also, his father was born in Burkina Faso. The Rally of the Republicans (RDR), an opposition party formed as a split from the ruling Democratic Party of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (PDCI) in 1994, sought for Ouattara to be its presidential candidate. In late June 1995, RDR Secretary-General Djéni Kobina met with Ouattara, at which time, according to Kobina, Ouattara said: &quot;I&#x27;m ready to join you.&quot; The party nominated Ouattara as its presidential candidate on 3 July 1995 at its first ordinary congress. The government would not change the electoral code, however, and Ouattara declined the nomination. The RDR boycotted the election, along with the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) of Laurent Gbagbo, leaving the PDCI&#x27;s candidate, incumbent president Henri Konan Bédié, to win an easy victory.

===President of the RDR===
While serving as Deputy Managing Director at the IMF, in March 1998, Ouattara expressed his intention to return to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and take part in politics again. After leaving the IMF in July 1999, he was elected President of the RDR on 1 August 1999 at an extraordinary congress of the party, as well as being chosen as its candidate for the next presidential election. He said he was eligible to stand in the election, pointing to documents he said demonstrated that he and his parents were of Ivorian birth.

He was accused of forging these papers, prompting investigations. President Bédié described Ouattara as a Burkinabé and said that Houphouët-Boigny &quot;wanted Alassane Ouattara to concern himself only with the economy&quot;. Ouattara&#x27;s nationality certificate, issued in late September 1999, was annulled by a court on 27 October. An arrest warrant for Ouattara was issued on 29 November, although he was out of the country at the time; he nevertheless said that he would return by late December.

On 24 December, the military seized power, ousting Bédié. Ouattara returned to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire after three months in France on 29 December, hailing Bédié&#x27;s ouster as &quot;not a coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but &quot;a revolution supported by all the Ivorian people&quot;.

A new constitution, approved by referendum in July 2000, controversially barred presidential candidates unless both of their parents were Ivorians, and Ouattara was disqualified from the 2000 presidential election. The issues surrounding this were major factors in the First Ivorian Civil War, which broke out in 2002.

When asked in an interview about Ouattara&#x27;s nationality, Burkinabé President Blaise Compaoré responded, &quot;For us, things are simple: he does not come from Burkina Faso, neither by birth, marriage, or naturalization. This man has been Prime Minister of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.&quot;

President Gbagbo affirmed on 6 August 2007 that Ouattara could stand in the next Ivorian presidential election. Ouattara was designated as the RDR&#x27;s presidential candidate at its Second Ordinary Congress on 1–3 February 2008; he was also re-elected as President of the RDR for another five years. At the congress, he invited the former rebel New Forces, from whom he had previously distanced himself, to team up with the RDR for the election.

At the time, Ouattara said publicly that he did not believe Gbagbo would organize transparent and fair elections.

The RDR and the PDCI are both members of the Rally of Houphouëtistes, and while Ouattara and Bédié ran separately in the first round, each agreed to support the other if only one of them made it into a potential second round.

===2010 presidential election and aftermath===


The presidential elections that should have been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results announced independently by the president of the Electoral Commission from the headquarters of Ouattara due to concern about fraud in that commission. They showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.

The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council, charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the New Forces. These charges were contradicted by United Nations observers (unlike African Union observers). The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consisted of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote – instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission. After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara—who was recognized as the winner by most countries and the United Nations—organized an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees fled the country.

The African Union sent Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution recognising Alassane Ouattara as winner of the elections, based on the position of the Economic Community of West African States, which suspended Ivory Coast from all its decision-making bodies while the African Union also suspended the country&#x27;s membership.

In 2010, a colonel of the Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao, was arrested in New York in a year-long U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation charged with procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions: 4,000 9 mm handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 tear-gas grenades, in violation of a UN embargo. Several other Ivory Coast officers were released because they had diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.

The 2010 presidential election led to the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis and the Second Ivorian Civil War. International organizations reported numerous human-rights violations by both sides. In the city of Duékoué, hundreds of people were killed. In nearby Bloléquin, dozens were killed. UN and French forces took military action against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was taken into custody after a raid into his residence on 11 April 2011. The country was severely damaged by the war, and observers say it will be a challenge for Ouattara to rebuild the economy and reunite Ivorians.

The developments in the country were welcomed by world leaders. U.S. President Barack Obama applauded news of the developments in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and CNN quoted U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as saying Gbagbo&#x27;s capture &quot;sends a strong signal to dictators and tyrants... They may not disregard the voice of their own people&quot;.

==== 2012 marriage law row ====
In a controversial move in November 2012, President Ouattara sacked his government in a row over a new marriage law that would make wives joint heads of the household. His own party supported the changes, but the elements of the ruling coalition resisted, with the strongest opposition coming from the Democratic Party of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

===Second term, 2015–2020===
Ouattara won a second five-year term in 2015 with almost 84% of the vote. With 2,118,229 votes, or 83.66% of votes cast, and a 54.63% turnout, his victory was a landslide compared to the 50% required to avoid a run-off and the 9% of his closest rival, FPI leader Pascal Affi N&#x27;Guessan.

At the RDR&#x27;s Third Ordinary Congress on 9–10 September 2017, it was expected that Ouattara would be elected as President of the RDR, but he instead proposed Henriette Diabaté for the post, and she was duly elected by acclamation.

In March 2020, Ouattara announced he would not run again in the presidential elections of 31October 2020, and supported Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly as the presidential candidate of the RDR. After the sudden death of Coulibaly on 8July 2020, Ouattara considered putting forward Defense Minister Hamed Bakayoko, before changing his mind due to alleged links to drug trafficking. In July, he announced a run for a third term in office. His candidacy was controversial, for the Ivorian constitution permits only two presidential terms. The Constitutional Court ruled that the first term under a different constitution did not count for the purposes of the two-term rule of the current constitution, thus allowing Ouattara&#x27;s candidacy; this led to violent protests in Abidjan and throughout the country. The election of October 2020 was thus boycotted by a large part of the opposition, and saw the reelection of Alassane Ouattara with 95.31% of the votes under a 53.90% turnout.

<text>A Holocaust memorial day or Holocaust remembrance day is an annual observance to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust, the genocide of six million Jews and of millions of other Holocaust victims by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. Many countries, primarily in Europe, have designated national dates of commemoration. In 2005, the United Nations instituted an international observance, International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Many observances fall on 27 January, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp in 1945, while other countries selected separate dates, often to mark anniversaries of national events during the Holocaust. Holocaust remembrance days often include efforts to combat hatred and antisemitism.

In February 2025, Google announced that Holocaust Remembrance Days would no longer be highlighted by default on Google Calendar, arguing that it was no longer &quot;scalable or sustainable&quot; to continue adding the growing number of national and international &quot;cultural moments&quot; manually to its calendars.

== List of observances ==

, twelve countries observed January 27, the day of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, including Germany, Britain, Italy and Scandinavian countries. In 2003 France designated this date as the day of remembrance of genocides and prevention of crimes against humanity. In 2004 Israel designated this date as a mark of the struggle against antisemitism.

, eleven countries in Europe had chosen dates related to local histories.

==Commemorations and memorials==
* In January 2020, a ceremony was held at Auschwitz to mark the 75th anniversary of its liberation on January 27, 1945. this included speeches by numerous officials and Jewish communal leaders. Large number of Holocaust survivors attended this ceremony. In the United Kingdom, government officials, religious leaders and community leaders gathered in London to commemorate this anniversary. On the same date, German police reported they were investigating the sales of a brand of beer with Nazi-style symbols on its labeling.
* In 2021 a number of Jewish organizations in the United Kingdom incorporated the situation in Xinjiang into their Holocaust Memorial Day remembrances and commemorations.

<text>Reebok Pump is a line of athletic shoes that was first released on November 24, 1989, by Reebok. It was the first shoe to have an internal inflation mechanism that regulated a unique fitting cushion in the lower and upper tongue to provide locking around the ankle.

==History==
In 1988, Design Continuum, an industrial design firm, partnered with Reebok to design a shoe that used inflatable chambers that pump up for a custom fit, the Reebok Pump. A demo version of the Pump, a customizable inflatable/deflatable high-top shoe, was exhibited at the Sporting Goods Manufacturers&#x27; Association in February 1989. On November 24, 1989, the first Reebok Pump was released. That month, Dominique Wilkins was featured on a television commercial introducing the Reebok Pump. Reebok released the Omni Zone, Twilight Zone and the SXT Pump in 1990. That year, Michael Chang&#x27;s Court Victory Pumps was launched.
In February 1991, Dee Brown inflated his Reebok Pumps in front of a national audience before scoring a title-winning dunk during the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. That year, Pump expanded into cross-training, off-road, golf, walking, aerobics and running shoes. The unreleased NES video game &quot;Drac&#x27;s Night Out&quot; would have featured Reebok Pumps as an in-game power-up as part of a sponsorship deal between Reebok and game publisher Parker Brothers. Fullfoot, midfoot, collar, arch, footbed and Dual Chamber support was offered at the time. The pump technology was patented as USPTO #5113599 in May 1992. That year, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal was given his own pair of pumps. The Pump Graphlite, a running shoe endorsed by Dan O&#x27;Brien and Dave Johnson was released in 1992. That year, the film &quot;Juice&quot; included a montage of Omar Epps&#x27; character trying on different Reebok Pumps before meeting up with Tupac. The Blacktop Model was released in 1991. In 1994, Reebok partnered with &quot;Above the Rim&quot;, an American drama directed by Jeff Pollack and Tupac to create a full line of shoes named after the movie. In the same year, the Instapump Fury was launched.

John Cena wore Pumps as part of his old-school hip hop gimmick in 2004. During the NBA All-Star weekend in 2005, Reebok introduced the ATR (Above the Rim) Pump. Allen Iverson, Yao Ming, Steve Francis, Baron Davis and Jerome Williams showcased the ATR Pump during the NBA All-Star Game 2005. In April 2005, the Pump 2.0 was launched. The following year, Allen Iverson&#x27;s The Answer IX featured the Pump Auto/Off Smart Valve. The system automatically engaged or deactivated depending on performance needs. The Reebok Pump X MLB, an edition paying homage to Shea Stadium and the Yankee Stadium was released in 2008. Reebok released an original reproduction of The Fury in its &#x27;Black/Citron/Red&#x27; colorway and 27 additional collaborative design versions of the shoe for its 20th anniversary in 2014. In September 2014, the Keith Haring x Reebok Classic &quot;Crack is Wack&quot; collection Pumps, named after the 1986 mural, were released. That month, the Reebok Court Victory Pump was re-released.

==Collaborations==
From 2007 to 2009 Reebok partnered with ALIFE to create shoe designs. Reebok&#x27;s retro program has collaborated with Rolland Berry, John Maeda, the Commonwealth store in Virginia, Boston&#x27;s own Bodega, Ubiq in Philadelphia and Atmos in Tokyo. Reebok also worked with Orchard St, a New York-based retailer, to create a design for the Reebok Pump Omni Hex Ride. In March 2014, Reebok collaborated with sneaker retailer Limited Edt to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the InstaPump Fury.

===25th anniversary===
In 2014, Reebok collaborated with various designers to release the 25th anniversary edition Pumps.

<doc id="1173631" wikidata="Q465290" url="?curid=1173631" title="Renhō">
<text>, known mononymously as Renhō, is a Japanese politician and former journalist who served as member of the House of Councillors from 2004 to 2024. She was the leader of the now-defunct major opposition party, the Democratic Party from 2016 to 2017. Renhō was a candidate for the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial election with the support of the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), Japanese Communist Party (JCP), and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), but was defeated by incumbent Yuriko Koike, placing third behind Shinji Ishimaru.

== Early and personal life==

Renhō was born Hsieh Lien-fang () in Tokyo to a Japanese mother Saitō Keiko (斉藤圭子) and Han Taiwanese father Hsieh Ge-hsin (謝哲信). She has two brothers: one is a year older, the other is two years younger. Mark Chen, a Taiwanese politician and former Secretary-General of the Office of the President of the Republic of China, is a distant relative of hers. She studied at Aoyama Gakuin in Tokyo from kindergarten through university. She enrolled in the law faculty of Aoyama Gakuin University and graduated in 1990 with the B.L. degree in Public Law.

Born as a citizen of Taiwan, she did not become a citizen of Japan until 1985 when Japanese nationality law was amended to allow Japanese mothers to pass Japanese nationality to their children. She was legally a dual citizen until 2016. She adopted her mother&#x27;s surname, , when she acquired Japanese citizenship; to avoid name confusion in her career, she began to go simply by Renhō.

After her debut as a Clarion Girl in 1988, Renhō appeared on several television and radio programs as a commentator. In 1993, she became a newscaster on TBS and TV Asahi, covering several historical events including the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995.

She was married in 1993. She is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and had also studied it at Peking University in Beijing, China, from 1995 to 1997. Renhō returned to television in 2000, anchoring and reporting on several TBS programs. She reported from Taiwan during Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s presidential campaign, which brought her to the attention of Taiwanese political leaders. In Taiwan, she is often referred to as Lien-fang, the Standard Chinese pronunciation of her given name.

==Political career==
In July 2004, Renhō was elected to the House of Councillors representing Tokyo as a member of the Democratic Party of Japan. Since election, she has been heavily involved in parenting issues and policies. Renhō has criticized Japan&#x27;s diplomacy with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and its refusal to recognize Taiwan, stating that &quot;Japan is too polite when dealing with China, taking a low profile&quot; and &quot;Taiwan is my father&#x27;s country. Why isn&#x27;t Taiwan a country?&quot; Since taking office, she has traveled to Taiwan several times on official and unofficial business, garnering extensive public and media attention, and has become close to senior members of the Democratic Progressive Party.

=== DPJ government (2009–12) ===
After the DPJ assumed the reins of government in September 2009, she received much public attention for her stern stance and direct questions to bureaucrats during special fiscal screening committees of the established under Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.

In June 2010, then Prime Minister Naoto Kan appointed her as Minister for Administrative Reforms. Upon taking the post, Renhō stated that she would be giving particular attention to eliminating waste in the 21 government account. She lost her seat in Cabinet in a subsequent reshuffle, but was retained as a special advisor to the Prime Minister.

In the 2010 House of Councillors election, she garnered a record 1,710,734 constituency votes.

She served as a member of the Cabinet of Japan from 2010 to 2012, serving as Minister for Government Revitalisation and Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety. In September 2011, she was re-appointed as State Minister of Government Revitalization (responsible for administrative reforms) in the cabinet of then prime minister Yoshihiko Noda. Her new portfolio also included responsibility for civil service reform, gender equality and Japan&#x27;s declining birthrate. She served in this post until a cabinet reshuffle in January 2012.

The DPJ was ousted from government in the 2012 general election, following which Renhō returned to the opposition bench. She retained her seat in the 2016 House of Councillors Election.

=== Leader of the Democratic Party (2016–17) ===
In September 2016, she was elected as the leader of Japan&#x27;s Democratic Party, making her the first woman elected as their leader, and the first person with mixed ethnic heritage and born with foreign citizenship to head a major political party in Japan. As head of the Democratic Party, she stated her opposition to revisions of Article 9 of the Constitution, but that she was willing to join debates with the Liberal Democratic Party on other constitutional revisions. She viewed Abenomics to be a partial success, but pushes for greater investment in education, child-rearing and nursing care. She also ruled out forming a coalition government with the Japanese Communist Party and opposed the TPP.

During the presidential election, Renhō claimed that she had given up her Taiwanese citizenship. However, reports emerged that her Taiwanese citizenship had not been properly renounced. In response to doubts regarding her legal status, she took steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship beginning in late 2016.

In July 2017, the Democratic Party suffered a very poor showing in the Tokyo prefectural election. Some senior party members blamed the results, in part, on the ongoing questions surrounding Renhō&#x27;s citizenship. In response to these concerns, she provided evidence of her renunciation of Taiwanese citizenship at a press conference later that month. Days after her press conference, and days following the resignation of former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as party secretary-general, Renhō resigned as party leader, stating that she had not shown sufficient ability to lead it.

=== In the CDP (2017–2024) ===
Dissatisfied with the ambiguous direction of the DP leadership post the 2017 election, Renhō expressed interest in joining the new progressive Constitutional Democratic Party and had an exploratory talk with CDP leader Yukio Edano in mid-December. She applied to join the CDP on December 26, 2017, citing the DP&#x27;s lack of policy directions and the CDP&#x27;s conversely clear policy directions. The CDP admitted her into the party on December 28, 2017.

On May 27, 2024, Renhō announced that she would run in the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial election, an office held at the time by Yuriko Koike. She automatically lost her seat in the House of Councillors on June 20, the day of the official announcement &quot;(kokuji)&quot; of the gubernatorial election. Renhō underperformed expectations, securing 1,283,262 votes, accounting for 18.8% of the total vote share.

== Family ==
Renhō married journalist in August 1993, and gave birth to fraternal twins Rin (a boy) and Suiran (a girl) in 1997; Rin went on to become a male &quot;idol&quot; performer. The couple divorced by mutual consent in August 2020. According to her ex-husband, Renhō proposed the divorce as she wanted to stay in Tokyo and continue her political work, while her husband wanted to move out of the city. Following the divorce, her ex-husband told a television reporter that &quot;our relationship hasn&#x27;t changed; we just don&#x27;t live together.&quot;

<doc id="1173640" wikidata="Q554869" url="?curid=1173640" title="Sonobuoy">
<text>A sonobuoy (a portmanteau of sonar and buoy) is a small expendable sonar buoy dropped from aircraft or ships for anti-submarine warfare or underwater acoustic research. Sonobuoys are typically around in diameter and long. When floating on the water, sonobuoys have both a radio transmitter above the surface and hydrophone sensors underwater.

==Theory of operation==
Sonobuoys are ejected from aircraft in canisters and deploy upon water impact. An inflatable surface float with a radio transmitter remains on the surface for communication with the aircraft, while one or more hydrophone sensors and stabilizing equipment descend below the surface to a selected depth that is variable, depending on environmental conditions and the search pattern. The buoy relays acoustic information from its hydrophone(s) via UHF/VHF radio to operators on board the aircraft.

==History==

With the technological improvement of the submarine in modern warfare, the need for an effective tracking system was born. Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR) was originally developed by the British—who called it ASDIC—in the waning days of World War I. At the time the only way to detect submarines was by listening for them (passive sonar), or visually by chance when they were on the surface recharging their battery banks. Air patrols (the British mostly used small airships which had the advantage of long endurance) could spot surfaced submarines and occasionally, when conditions were right, even submerged ones as the diving depth of submarines of the era was so limited. If contact was made, they would follow the submarine while summoning surface ships by radio to attack it.

Sonar saw extremely limited use and was mostly tested in the Atlantic Ocean with few naval officers seeing any merit in the system. With the end of World War I came the end to serious development of sonar in the United States, a fact that was to be fatal in the early days of World War II. However, considerable development of ASDIC took place in the United Kingdom, including integration with a plotting table and weapon.

While the United Kingdom pursued the development of sonar during the interwar period, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey during the 1920s developed the radio acoustic ranging method of fixing the position of survey ships during hydrographic survey operations by detonating a small explosive at the location of the ship, recording the time it took for the sound of the explosion to reach distant hydrophones mounted at shore stations or aboard crewed station ships, and radioing the time of receipt of the sound to the ship, allowing the crew to make precise position fixes by using triangulation. In 1931, the Coast and Geodetic Survey proposed the replacement of crewed station ships with &quot;radio-sonobuoys&quot;, and placed the new buoys in service beginning in July 1936. These buoys weighed , could be deployed or recovered by Coast and Geodetic Survey ships in five minutes, and were equipped with subsurface hydrophones, batteries, and radio transmitters that automatically sent a radio signal when their hydrophones detected the sound of a ranging explosion. These &quot;radio-sonobuoys&quot; were the ancestors of the sonobuoys that began to appear in the 1940s.

The damage inflicted upon the Allies by German U-boats during World War II made the need for sonar a priority. With millions of tons of shipping being sunk in the Atlantic, there was a need to locate submarines so that they could be sunk or prevented from attacking. Sonar was installed on a number of ships along with radar and high-frequency direction finding (&quot;Huff-Duff&quot;) to detect surfaced submarines. While sonar was a primitive system, it was constantly improved.

Modern anti-submarine warfare methods evolved from the techniques devised for the movement of convoys and battle groups through hostile waters during World War II. It was imperative that submarines be detected and neutralized long before the task group came within range of an attack. Aircraft-based submarine detection was the obvious solution. The maturity of radio communication and sonar technology made it possible to combine a sonar transducer, batteries, a radio transmitter and whip antenna, within a self-contained air-deployed floating (sono)buoy.

Early sonobuoys had limited range, limited battery life and were overwhelmed by the noise of the ocean. They first appeared during World War II, in which they first were used in July 1942 by RAF Coastal Command under the code name &#x27;High Tea&#x27;, the first squadron to use them operationally being No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. They were also limited by the use of human ears to discriminate man-made noises from the oceanic background. However, they demonstrated that the technology was viable. With the development of better hydrophones, the transistor and miniaturization, and the realization that very low frequency sound was important, more effective acoustic sensors followed. The sonobuoy went from being an imposing tall, diameter sensor to the compact suite of electronics it is today.

The advancement in sonobuoy technology aided the development of aircraft such as the P-2 Neptune, S-2 Tracker, S-3B Viking and P-3 Orion for anti-submarine warfare.

==Operation==
Sonobuoys are classified into three categories: active, passive and special purpose.

*Active sonobuoys emit sound energy (pings) into the water and listen for the returning echo before transmitting information—usually range and bearing—via UHF/VHF radio to a receiving ship or aircraft. The original active sonobuoys pinged continuously after deployment for a predetermined period of time. Later, Command Activated Sonobuoy System (CASS) sonobuoys allowed the aircraft to trigger pings (or buoy scuttling) via a radio link. This evolved into DICASS (Directional CASS) in which the return echo contained bearing as well as range data.
*Passive sonobuoys emit nothing into the water, but rather listen, waiting for sound waves (for instance, power plant, propeller or door-closing and other noises) from ships or submarines, or other acoustic signals of interest such as a crashed aircraft&#x27;s black box pinger, to reach the hydrophone. The sound is then transmitted via UHF/VHF radio to a receiving ship or aircraft.
*Special purpose sonobuoys relay various types of oceanographic data to a ship, aircraft, or satellite. There are three types of special-purpose sonobuoys in use today. These sonobuoys are not designed for use in submarine detection or localization.
**BT—The bathythermobuoy (BT) relay bathythermographic and/or salinity readings at various depths. Laying a pattern of sonobuoys is often preceded by laying one or more bathythermobouys to detect density/temperature strata. Such strata can act as sonar reflectors or, conversely, as waveguides.
**SAR—The search and rescue (SAR) buoy is designed to operate as a floating radio frequency beacon. As such, it is used to assist in marking the location of an aircraft crash site, a sunken ship, or survivors at sea.
**ATAC/DLC—Air transportable communication (ATAC) and down-link communication (DLC) buoys, such as the UQC, or &quot;gertrude&quot;, are intended for use as a means of communication between an aircraft and a submarine, or between a ship and a submarine.

This information is analyzed by computers, acoustic operators and tactical coordinators to interpret the sonobuoy information.

Active and/or passive sonobuoys may be laid in large fields or barriers for initial detection. Active buoys may then be used for precise location. Passive buoys may also be deployed on the surface in patterns to allow relatively precise location by triangulation. Multiple aircraft or ships monitor the pattern either passively listening or actively transmitting to drive the submarine into the sonar net. Sometimes the pattern takes the shape of a grid or other array formation and complex beamforming signal processing is used to transcend the capabilities of single, or limited numbers of, hydrophones.

<text>The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (WBNUJS or NUJS or NLU Kolkata) is a National Law University (NLU) located in BidhanNagar, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. In 2023, it was ranked 4th among law colleges in India by National Institutional Ranking Framework and 2nd by &quot;India Today&quot;. It comes under the exclusive chancellorship and purview of the Chief Justice of India.

The university was one of the first law universities to offer a five-year integrated B.A. LLB (Hons.) and an LLM program with five different specializations (Corporate &amp; Commercial Law, International &amp; Comparative Law, Criminal &amp; Security Law, Law &amp; Technology and Intellectual Property Law), later on added a five-year B.Sc. LLB program (with a general B.Sc. degree) as well which was discontinued in 2011 after a change in BCI requirements regarding the same. It then started a B.Sc. LLB (Hons.) course, offering B.Sc. in Forensic science and Criminology, in 2023. Admission to the B.A. LLB or B.Sc. LLB degree program and the LLM. program is through the Common Law Admission Test (a highly competitive, ranked among the top 05 hardest entrance examinations in India), held jointly by the national law schools/universities. NUJS/NLU Kolkata also offers M.Sc. in Forensic science, MPhil, Ph.D., LL.D, and diplomas in business laws and other programs, in addition to a number of online courses. In 2024, it has also started a specialized 2-Year LLM. program on Data Science &amp; Data Protection Law, in collaboration with IISER Kolkata and IIIT Kalyani as knowledge partners and Cognizant as the industry partner.

==History==

NUJS was established in 1999 by the Bar Council of India (BCI), with the government of West Bengal. The Founder-Vice-Chancellor was Professor N.R. Madhava Menon, a former professor of law at Delhi University, and Founder-Director, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bangalore, who is credited with revolutionising the field of legal education in India, by starting the concept of &quot;national law schools&quot;, as opposed to the traditional law colleges prevalent before.

The NUJS, along with NLSIU and GNLU, remain the only three national law schools that have the honourable Chief Justice of India as the Chancellor.

The then Chief Minister Jyoti Basu helped in improving the university. Other aspects of the university was worked on by Sh. Jyoti Basu, former Chief Minister of West Bengal who was a Middle Temple barrister, Sh. Somnath Chatterjee, former Speaker of the Lok Sabha, also a Middle Temple barrister and a leading member of the Calcutta Bar Library; and Justice Chittotosh Mookerjee, a former Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and the Bombay High Court and the acting Governor of Maharashtra. Justice Mookerjee was the university&#x27;s Honorary Treasurer and has been associated with the university&#x27;s work since its inception in 1999. The NUJS is an autonomous university.

Initially, classes, which started in 2000, were held at Aranya Bhavan, where the Environment Ministry of the government of West Bengal is located, and the first batches of students started living in government flats. On 28 October 2002, the university&#x27;s present-day permanent campus was inaugurated by the then Chief Justice of India, B. N. Kirpal. Similarly, the first batch of the B.Sc. LLB (Hons.) program that started in 2023 is being taught in a BSNL office located in Sector I of Bidhannagar, and currently resides in Sector V of Bidhannagar in renovated government apartments of the BSNL Eastern Nodal Training Centre&#x27;s residential society (along with the M.Sc. and LL.M. students). Once the ongoing vertical extension of the main campus is completed, the batch is to be shifted to the main campus permanently. In 2006, NUJS was allotted a plot in Rajarhat, an upscale township, which is being developed by the West Bengal government.

==Campus==
===Hostels===
The Salt Lake Campus consists of an academic block and three residential blocks. The latter comprises two, seven-storied halls of residence for girls and boys, and a double-storied faculty accommodation house-cum-guest house. The second campus in Sector III for the B.Sc. LLB (Hons.), M.Sc., and LL.M. batches has twin three-storied residential blocks, one for boys and one for girls. The university&#x27;s academic block, christened after B.R. Ambedkar, is a four-storied octagonal structure that opens inwardly to a lawn. The building houses classrooms, a library and reading room, two conference halls, offices and an auditorium. The temporary academic block for the B.Sc. LLB (Hons.) program in Sector I is located on the renovated first and second floors of a BSNL office, housing classrooms, a library, a conference hall, offices and an auditorium.

NUJS&#x27;s main campus is located on a plot in Salt Lake City, overseeing the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. The National Institute of Fashion Technology and the College of Leather Technology border the Campus. 
NUJS&#x27;s Rajarhat Campus is yet to be built. No significant construction has been undertaken and the land lies vacant.

Admission to the hostels is conducted simultaneously with admission to the university.

Hostel Names: Kanchenjunga &amp; Nilgiri.

<doc id="1173650" wikidata="Q4708035" url="?curid=1173650" title="Alan Whicker">
<text>Donald Alan Whicker (2 August 1921 – 12 July 2013) was a British journalist and television presenter and broadcaster. His career spanned almost 60 years, during which time he presented the documentary television programme &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot; for over 30 years. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005 for services to broadcasting.

== Early life==

Whicker was born to British parents in Cairo, Egypt, in 1921. When he was two years old his father Charles, a British Army officer, became seriously ill with a heart problem and died. The family, now consisting of his mother Nancy, Alan and his elder sister Mary, moved to Richmond in Surrey. His sister soon died, too. He attended Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys School, an all-boys independent boarding school, where he excelled at cross-country running.

==Military service==
During the Second World War he served in the British Army. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Devonshire Regiment on 8 August 1942. He then joined the British Army&#x27;s Army Film and Photographic Unit in Italy in 1943, filming at Anzio and meeting such influential figures as Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. In March 1944, he was mentioned in despatches &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Sicily&quot;. He transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps on 1 April 1945 with the war substantive rank of lieutenant.

In the documentary &quot;Whicker&#x27;s War&quot; he revealed that he was one of the first in the Allied forces to enter Milan and that he took into custody an SS general and staff who were guarding the SS&#x27;s paymaster&#x27;s payroll money used to pay the SS troops, along with large amounts of cash in various foreign currencies, all contained within a large trunk. Whicker later handed over the SS men and the trunk of cash to the commander of an advancing US armoured column. While in Milan Whicker shot footage of the body of Benito Mussolini and was also responsible for taking into custody British traitor John Amery.

== Broadcasting career ==

After the Second World War, Whicker became a journalist and broadcaster, acting as a newspaper correspondent during the Korean War. After joining the BBC in 1957, he became an international reporter for their &quot;Tonight&quot; programme. In 1958, he started presenting &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;, which began life as a segment on the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme before becoming a fully-fledged series itself in the 1960s. &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot; was filmed all over the globe and became a huge ratings success in the UK. Whicker continued to present the series up until the 1990s, and he won a BAFTA Award in 1964 for his presentation in the Factual category; he also won the Richard Dimbleby Award at the 1978 BAFTA ceremony. Whicker was instrumental in launching Yorkshire Television (which made &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot; for some years), producing television programmes for them from 1969 until 1992. At the beginning of the ITV series, Whicker made &quot;Papa Doc – The Black Sheep&quot; (1969) on Haiti and its dictator François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier who made himself available to Whicker and his team.

Whicker appeared in various adverts for American Express, Barclaycard, and was also the man behind the advertising slogan &quot;Hello World&quot;, for travelocity. He narrated the 2007 and 2008 BBC documentary series &quot;Comedy Map of Britain&quot;.

In the 2005 New Year Honours Whicker was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to broadcasting. In 2009, then aged 88, Whicker returned to some of the locations and people who were originally featured in &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot; for the BBC series &quot;Alan Whicker&#x27;s Journey of a Lifetime&quot;. In this, he met various people whom he had interviewed decades earlier to see how their lives had progressed or changed since the initial programme.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1983 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Berkeley Hotel in Kensington, London.

== Personal life ==

Whicker had a relationship with Olga Deterding from 1966 to 1969. He was with his partner, Valerie Kleeman (who was 25 years his junior), from 1969. He neither married nor had children.

== Death ==

Whicker died on 12 July 2013 from bronchial pneumonia at his home in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, aged 91. Broadcaster Michael Parkinson stated that Whicker was &quot;a fine journalist and great storyteller&quot;, adding: &quot;I can think of no other television reporter before or since who created such a wonderful catalogue of unforgettable programmes.&quot; Michael Palin said that Whicker was &quot;a great character, a great traveller and an excellent reporter&quot;, while travel presenter Judith Chalmers said he was &quot;an icon for the travel industry&quot;.

Most obituary writers said that Whicker was 87 at the time of his death, based on his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; giving a date of birth in 1925. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; pointed out that his age had been queried, with school records showing his birthdate in August 1921, making him 91 when he died.

In June 2015 it was announced that Whicker&#x27;s estate would fund, through The Whickers, three annual awards totalling over £100,000 to be awarded to documentary makers, including funding and recognition prizes for audio documentaries.

== In popular culture ==

While presenting &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;, Whicker was known for his subtle brand of satire and social commentary. &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot; was parodied in a &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; sketch featuring a tropical island, &quot;Whicker Island&quot;, where all the inhabitants dress and act like Whicker. Benny Hill, towards the end of his BBC series in 1968, impersonated Whicker in a parody called &quot;Knicker&#x27;s World&quot;. 

He was parodied again in 1981 by the Evasions, a British funk group whose song, &quot;Wikka Wrap&quot;, featured songwriter Graham de Wilde impersonating Whicker; the song was later sampled in American rapper Coolio&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin&#x27; New)&quot;. De Wilde also composed the theme tune for the 1980s BBC episodes of &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;.

<text>Vegard Sverre Tveitan (born 10 October 1975), better known by his stage name Ihsahn ( ), is a Norwegian musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and composer who is best known for his work with the black metal band Emperor. Tveitan is also a founding member of Thou Shalt Suffer, where he played guitar and keyboard in addition to vocal duties, and Peccatum, a project in collaboration with his wife and fellow musician Heidi Solberg Tveitan, also known as Starofash. Since 2006, Tveitan has primarily devoted himself to solo albums and occasional guest appearances.

Beyond the characteristics typically associated with metal music, Tveitan&#x27;s musical style also includes classical, industrial, and progressive elements. He is a progenitor of the symphonic black metal genre.

== Biography ==
Tveitan was born in Notodden, Norway, where he grew up on a large farm. He began playing piano at age six and guitar at age 10.

=== Early years: Xerasia, Embryonic, and Thou Shalt Suffer ===
At the age of 13, Tveitan met Tomas Haugen (also known as Samoth), who would become his long time collaborator and the co-founder of Emperor. While at a music seminar, Tveitan gained Haugen&#x27;s attention with his Iron Maiden patches.

In 1990 Tveitan joined Haugen&#x27;s band Xerasia, a death metal band in which he played guitar and keyboards. They eventually changed their name to Embryonic sometime that year. In November, the band released a self-financed four-track demo titled &quot;The Land of the Lost Souls&quot;. In 1991 they changed their name again to Thou Shalt Suffer. The project was partially funded by a government grant and the group made several releases in 1990 and 1991. Shortly after, Haugen left the band to focus on other projects. Tveitan later used the name Thou Shalt Suffer to release an album of electronic music that he composed entitled Somnium.

=== Formation of Emperor and Peccatum ===
Later in 1991 Haugen and Tveitan formed Emperor. Emperor had a much more refined black metal sound which showcased Tveitan&#x27;s developing keyboard skills, a distinct feature that would appear in many of his later releases. The band at this time received a lot of support and encouragement from black metal pioneer Euronymous, and after several demos, the &quot;Emperor&quot; EP was released in 1993 to much acclaim.

During this time, bandmates Bård Eithun (also known as Faust) and Haugen were imprisoned; Eithun for murder and Haugen for arson. Tveitan retreated to a property owned by his family to compose much of what would later become &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk,&quot; which was recorded after Haugen&#x27;s parole.

In 1995 the cult album &quot;Blood Must be Shed&quot;, by Zyklon-B was released featuring members of Emperor and Satyricon. Tveitan played synth on the album. In 1998 Tveitan and his wife Heidi Solberg Tveitan—who at the time used the stage name Ihriel—formed the experimental band Peccatum. Tveitan offered his iconic synth sound as well as clean and black vocals to the project. Peccatum would eventually becoming his main project until its termination on 4 March 2006.

In 1999 Emperor released &quot;IX Equilibrium&quot;, Tveitan&#x27;s third studio album with the group. Two years later, in 2001, Peccatum released their second studio album, &quot;Amor Fati&quot;. In the same year, Emperor released their fourth and final studio album, &quot;&quot;. &#x27;Prometheus&#x27; was entirely composed by Tveitan and featured more complex orchestration than previous works; though significantly fewer synthesizers than before. It was at this time that Emperor mutually decided to dissolve, leaving Tveitan and his bandmates with more time to focus on their various side projects.

2004 saw the release of Peccatum&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;Lost in Reverie&quot;, with an EP titled &quot;The Moribund People&quot; following the year after. On 30 September 2005, Emperor made a surprise return at &quot;Scream&quot; magazine&#x27;s 15-year anniversary party at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo. The show was kept top secret, only known by a handful of people. The band played three songs. This was to announce the reuniting of the band for a few shows around Europe and America in 2006, namely at Wacken and Inferno Festival.

=== Solo albums ===

==== 2006–2010: &quot;The Adversary&quot;, &quot;angL&quot;, and &quot;After&quot; ====

In April 2006, Tveitan released his first solo album, &quot;The Adversary&quot;. He recorded and produced the album by himself, with the exception of drums which were contributed by Asgeir Mickelson, and guest vocals on the track &quot;Homecoming&quot; by Kristoffer Rygg of Ulver. The album showcases his progressive influences as well as heavy metal, black metal and classical music. &quot;The Adversary&quot; was recorded at Symphonique Studios in Norway and was released on his label Mnemosyne Productions, which he founded in 2003 with Starofash. A video was made for the opening track, &quot;Invocation&quot;.

He released his second studio album, titled &quot;angL&quot;, the following year, featuring Lars K. Norberg on bass, Asgeir Mickelson on drums, and guest vocals from Mikael Åkerfeldt (of Opeth) on the track &quot;Unhealer&quot;.

In March 2009, Tveitan performed some of his solo material live for the first time, in a one-off performance opening for Opeth in Norway. He has since made many festival appearances, playing a mix of solo material and Emperor covers. Fellow Norwegians Leprous have served as his backing band. &quot;Grimen&quot;, the only album by side project &#x27;Hardingrock&#x27; was released the same year.

Tveitan released his third solo album, &quot;After&quot;, in January 2010. Lars K. Nordberg and Asgeir Mickelson once again contributed bass and drums, respectively, with Jørgen Munkeby (of Shining) playing saxophone on several tracks as well. Later that year, in October, a Mnemosyne web update confirmed that Ihsahn had already begun writing for a fourth solo album, and was also focusing on upgrading his studio at home.

==== 2011–2013: &quot;Eremita&quot; and &quot;Das Seelenbrechen&quot; ====
2011 was a busy year for Tveitan. Aside from making his solo debut in the US at the annual ProgPower USA metal festival in Atlanta, Georgia, he also performed as a guest on two records, co-produced the album &quot;Bilateral&quot; with his wife, and continued to work on his fourth solo album. Collaborators once again included Jørgen Munkeby and Devin Townsend, who in a November 2011 interview mentioned that he was &quot;singing a song for Ihsahn&#x27;s new thing&quot;, but added that he could not elaborate any more at that point in time.

In 2012, Tveitan released his fourth studio solo album, &quot;Eremita&quot;.

&quot;Das Seelenbrechen&quot; was released on 21 October 2013. It was recorded in Juke Joint Studio and Tveitan&#x27;s own Mnemosyne Studio.
==== 2016–present: &quot;Arktis&quot;, &quot;Àmr&quot;, and self-titled eighth album ====
In April 2016, Tveitan released his sixth studio album, &quot;Arktis&quot;, on Candlelight Records. The album was mixed and mastered by Jens Bogren. The album cover features a photograph of Fridtjof Nansen, whose 1896 mission to the North Pole fits with the lyrical atmosphere of the album. They also share their birthday of 10 October.

In 2018, Tveitan released &quot;Ámr&quot;, his seventh studio album. The title of the album is an old Norse word for &quot;loathsome&quot; or &quot;black&quot; and reflects the introspective nature of the songs. Tveitan added that the word &quot;Àmr&quot;, could also mean &quot;rust red&quot; and that the concept of a &quot;room without walls&quot; was a prevalent metaphor when working on the album. In comparison to previous albums, &quot;Àmr&quot; also features a greater use of electronic sounds, including analog synthesizers, that add to the intimate feeling of the music. In November 2023, Tveitan announced that his self-titled eighth album would be released on 16 February 2024. In addition to the traditional album version, the new album also includes an orchestral version. At the same time, the first single from the album, &quot;Pilgrimage to Oblivion&quot;, was released.

== Awards and publications ==
In 2002, Tveitan was awarded the Notodden kommunes kulturpris (Notodden Municipality&#x27;s Culture prize). He won the prize because he is considered the best-known inhabitant of Notodden, a great musician, a music teacher, and he arranges a lot of concerts for unknown bands. The fact that his band sold more than 500,000 copies was also a reason for getting the prize.

Tveitan has instructional videos on playing guitar that have appeared in online publications such as &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

Tveitan&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;After&quot;, was nominated for a Norwegian Grammy, a Spellemannprisen.

Tveitan lent his voice in 2007 to an animated character from the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, Eric von Wiechlinghammer, in the episode &quot;Dethfashion&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==
In an interview in 2012, Tveitan cited Iron Maiden, King Diamond, Judas Priest, and Pink Floyd as influential artists when he was young. He highlighted the conceptual and narrative aspects that these groups constructed their albums around as being particularly influential. His solo albums also strive to maintain a cohesive thread throughout. Tveitan has described planning the atmosphere and conceptual underpinnings of &quot;Arktis&quot; and &quot;Àmr&quot; before beginning the compositional process, and has rejected the idea that albums are mere collections of songs.

== Personal life ==
Ihsahn is married to Heidi Solberg Tveitan, known professionally as Starofash or Ihriel. He has cited her as an important creative collaborator on his solo albums. Ihsahn is the brother-in-law of Einar Solberg, the lead vocalist of the band Leprous, Kenneth Solberg, former guitarist of the band Leprous, and Lord PZ, who was a part of the band Peccatum together with both Ihsahn and his wife.

Ihsahn has a son named Angell Solberg Tveitan. He appears on the album &quot;Ámr&quot; on track 5.

===Beliefs===
Ihsahn described himself a Satanist in the 1990s, when he was 18 years old and mainly known as the Emperor guitarist. As he explained in 1994, he considered Satanism to be hard to define, as there are different ways of Satanism, and to be more of a category the individual would have to set for themselves. He considered most other adolescents to be &quot;soulless&quot; people, too involved in materialistic things. He said the imprisonment of the other Emperor members had both positive and negative effects; it meant a difficult period for the band, but the imprisonment also gave them publicity and therefore more possibilities to spread their ideas. Ihsahn additionally has said he has seen no reason to be physically destructive and has had no personal connection to the church burning cases that rocked Norway. In a 1994 interview, Ihsahn described a social Darwinist influence on his Satanism, calling himself anti-Christian and saying it is &quot;not for a weak person&quot;, while also expressing respect towards European paganism, meditation and stewardship of the environment. He has additionally condemned acts of criminality and other forms of religious intolerance such as the aforementioned arson cases.

<text>Pediatric [[endocrinology]] (British: Paediatric) is a medical subspecialty dealing with disorders of the endocrine glands, such as variations of physical growth and sexual development in childhood, diabetes and many more.

By age, pediatric endocrinologists, depending upon the age range of the patients they treat, care for patients from infancy to late adolescence and young adulthood.

The most common disease of the specialty is type 1 diabetes, which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders, especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. The specialty also deals with hypoglycemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty, as well other adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary problems. Many pediatric endocrinologists have interests and expertise in bone metabolism, lipid metabolism, adolescent gynecology, or inborn errors of metabolism.

Most pediatric endocrinologists in North America and many from around the world can trace their professional genealogy to Lawson Wilkins, who pioneered the specialty in the pediatrics department of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harriet Lane Home in Baltimore in between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s.

== Professional training ==
In the United States and Canada, pediatric endocrinology is a subspecialty of the American Board of Pediatrics or the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics, with board certification following fellowship training. It is a relatively small and primarily cognitive specialty, with few procedures and an emphasis on diagnostic evaluation.

Training for pediatric endocrinology consists of a 3-year fellowship following completion of a 3-year pediatrics residency. The fellowship, and the specialty, are heavily research-oriented and academically based, although less exclusively now than in past decades.

== Professional organizations ==
The principal North American professional association was originally named the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, now renamed the Pediatric Endocrine Society. Other longstanding pediatric endocrine associations include the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group and the Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology. Professional associations of the specialty continue to proliferate.

== Controversial treatment guidelines ==
In 2021, the Pediatric Endocrine Society offered updated recommendations for use of growth-promoting hormone therapy and related medications in children. The Guidelines for Growth Hormone and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Treatment in Children and Adolescents were updated from 2003 and reflect the continuing controversy over how to diagnose, categorize and treat growth failure in children. The guideline was developed following the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

In 2021, the Pediatric Endocrine Society released a position statement in support of Gender Affirming Care (GAC). In it the society states, &quot;Puberty suppression and/or gender-affirming hormone therapy is recommended within this evidence-based approach on a case-by-case basis as medically necessary and is potentially lifesaving.&quot; This position is at odds with the position of England&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS) which maintains that evidence for puberty blockers and hormone treatment for gender transition wholly is inadequate, and has decided to stop routine prescribing of puberty blockers.

<doc id="1173678" wikidata="Q276227" url="?curid=1173678" title="Martha Tilton">
<text>Martha Tilton (November 14, 1915 – December 8, 2006) was an American popular singer during America&#x27;s swing era and traditional pop period. She is best known for her 1939 recording of &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; with Benny Goodman.

Tilton was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States. Her family moved to Edna, Kansas, when she was three months old. They relocated to Los Angeles when she was seven years old. While attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, she was singing on a small radio station when she was heard by an agent who signed her and began booking her with larger stations.

She then dropped out of school in the eleventh grade to join Hal Grayson&#x27;s band. After singing with the quartet Three Hits and a Miss, she joined the Myer Alexander Chorus on Benny Goodman&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Camel Caravan&quot;. Goodman hired Tilton as a vocalist with his band in August 1937. She was with Goodman in January 1938, when the band performed at Carnegie Hall. She continued to appear as Goodman&#x27;s star vocalist until the end of 1939. She had a No. 1 hit with Benny Goodman&#x27;s recording of &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; in 1939.

==Recordings==
Tilton had a major success from 1942 to 1949 as one of the first artists to record for Capitol Records. Her first recording for Capitol was &quot;Moon Dreams&quot;, Capitol 138, with Orchestra and The Mellowaires, composed by Johnny Mercer and Glenn Miller pianist Chummy MacGregor in 1942. &quot;Moon Dreams&quot; would be recorded by Glenn Miller in 1944 and by Miles Davis in 1950.

Among her biggest hits as a solo artist were &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Alone&quot;, a wartime ballad which rose to No. 4 on the charts in 1944; &quot;I Should Care&quot; and &quot;A Stranger in Town,&quot; which both peaked at No. 10 in 1945; and three in 1947: &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra&quot; from &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, which climbed to No. 8; &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;, which hit No. 10; and &quot;I Wonder, I Wonder, I Wonder&quot;, which reached No. 9. After she left Capitol, Tilton recorded for other labels, including Coral and Tops. Among her later albums was &quot;We Sing the Old Songs&quot; (1957, Tops), a mix of older songs and recent standards, recorded with baritone Curt Massey.

Reviewing the two-CD set, &quot;The Liltin&#x27; Miss Tilton&quot;, (Capitol, 2000), critic Don Heckman wrote:

There are those who would say that Martha Tilton wasn&#x27;t a jazz singer at all. But swing-era fans won&#x27;t have any doubts, remembering her for a rocking version of &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; at Benny Goodman&#x27;s 1938 Carnegie Hall concert.

==Radio==
In 1941, Tilton sang on &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and starred on &quot;Campana Serenade&quot;, a program of popular music on first NBC and then CBS in 1942–1944. (Tilton sang on the later CBS version, with the Lud Gluskin Orchestra.) A contemporary newspaper article called Tilton&#x27;s role on &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; &quot;a milestone in her personal history ... Martha&#x27;s biggest transcontinental [broadcast] since her days as soloist with Benny Goodman.&quot;

In the early 1940s, she also sang on Ransom Sherman&#x27;s program on CBS. Massey and Tilton starred in &quot;Alka-Seltzer Time&quot;, a 15-minute radio series broadcast weekdays on both CBS and Mutual. Sponsored by Alka-Seltzer, this show began in 1949 as &quot;Curt Massey Time&quot; (sometimes advertised as &quot;Curt Massey Time with Martha Tilton&quot;) with a title change to highlight the sponsor&#x27;s product by 1952. Prior to that, Tilton had co-starred on &quot;The Jack Smith Show&quot;, another 15-minute radio musical program.

By 1953, the series was heard simultaneously on Mutual (at noon) and later that same day on CBS (at 5:45pm). Ads described the show as &quot;informal song sessions&quot; by vocalists Massey and Tilton, who was often billed as &quot;The liltin&#x27; Martha Tilton&quot;. The two Texan singers performed with Country Washburne and His Orchestra, featuring Charles LaVere on piano. The series ended November 6, 1953. However, Massey and Tilton continued to appear together during the late 1950s on such shows as &quot;Guest Star&quot; and &quot;Stars for Defense&quot;.

==Films==
Her movies include &quot;Sunny&quot; (1941), &quot;Strictly in the Groove&quot; (1942), &quot;Swing Hostess&quot; (1944), &quot;Crime, Inc.&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; (1956). Her last film appearance was as the band vocalist in the TV movie &quot;Queen of the Stardust Ballroom&quot; (1975). Tilton&#x27;s singing voice was used for other actresses including Barbara Stanwyck, Martha O&#x27;Driscoll, and Anne Gwynne.

She appeared in several Soundies musical films of the 1940s.

==Television==
Tilton once again worked with Massey in the late 1950s and early 1960s—this time on KRCA-TV in Los Angeles. They were reunited on that station&#x27;s &quot;Curt Massey Show&quot;. In 1960, Tilton won a Southland Emmy Award as outstanding female personality for her work on KRCA. In 1961, Tilton repeated as outstanding female personality, and the program won the Most Outstanding Musical or Variety Show award. Tilton also appeared as a guest star on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, on February 26, 1963 (Season 13, Episode 21) where they reminisce about their work entertaining soldiers for the USO.

==Personal life==
Tilton initially married Benny Goodman&#x27;s manager Leonard Vannerson, and they had two sons. She married James Brooks, a test pilot, in 1948. They had a daughter.

Tilton was a Republican.

On December 8, 2006, Tilton died of natural causes at her Brentwood home.

<doc id="1173679" wikidata="Q1997698" url="?curid=1173679" title="Praia do Norte">
<text>Praia do Norte is a civil parish of the municipality of Horta, located along the northern coast between Cedros and Capelo, on the Portuguese island of Faial, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 250, in an area of . It is the least populous parish on the island, reached along the &quot;Estrada Regional&quot; E.R.1-1ª regional roadway from the urban centre of Horta. It contains the localities Cerca, Fajã and Praia do Norte.

==History==

This parish, and its church, were first referenced on 30 June 1567, with the first five parishes of the municipality of Horta. Its fertile soils (which produced many of the islands cereals, beans and fruits) were situated in the area known as Nicho, a biforkation between the regional roadway and Norte Pequeno, that stretched to the road at Quinta. By 1643, there were 274 inhabitants and 77 homes in the area (as referenced by Diogo das Chagas). The parish at one time included the region of Capelo, but it was de-annexed.

The primitive parochial church was destroyed completely by the eruption of the Cabeço do Fogo volcano on 24 April 1672. At about one in the morning, a violent explosion awoke many of the residents, and forced them from their homes. Two lava flows escaped Cabeço do Fogo towards the north (Praia do Norte) and south (destroying the community of Ribeira do Cabo in Capelo). The northern flow, after pausing to destroy Lameiros, reached Praia do Norte where it covered the parish in black rock, including many of the large tracts of arable land. Many of the residents of the northern coast abandoned the area, eventually resulting in the parish being incorporated into the neighboring parish (Capelo). According to Américo Costa (in &quot;Dicionário Corográfico&quot;) a large part of the inhabitants of both parishes (Capelo and Praia do Norte) were affected by the eruption; homes and farmlands in Ribeira do Cabo (Capelo), Lameiros and Praia do Norte were destroyed. A niche, located at the intersection to Norte Pequeno, currently marks the position of the old church. Some inhabitants returned gradually, planting vineyards and fruit trees and small agricultural farming developed on the higher elevations.

By the beginning of the 18th century 712 inhabitants lived in 180 buildings in the parish. In 1787, a chapel of &quot;Nossa Senhora de Penha de França&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Peñafrancia&quot;) of was erected by the Madalena-native José Nunes da Silveira in Fajã da Praia. Another chapel, consecrated in the name of &quot;Nossa Senhora das Dores&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;), was constructed in 1797, following the original&#x27;s destruction during the 1672 eruption (which was also destroyed following the Capelinhos eruption).

Its civil parish status was returned on 1 October 1839, but only celebrated definitively in 1845, when it was extended from Praia de Baixo to the site of Ribeira das Canras.

During the course of the eruption of the Capelinhos volcano (between 1957 and 1958) the parish was shaken by earthquakes and inundated with ash. The church of Nossa Senhora das Dores was destroyed completely during the course of the earthquakes associated with the eruptions. The two-year event caused a flight of emigrants to the United States and Canada.

During the middle of the 20th century, the vineyards of the parish were attacked by pests that spread to the orange orchards and potato fields, causing loss of crops.

It was only in 1961 when a new modernist church was built.

===CP Valour/Fajã Oil Spill===

On December 9, 2005 while attempting to navigate to calm waters in the Bay of Praia do Fajã, the container vessel CP Valour, a Bermudan-registered ship, originally traveling between Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Valencia, Spain, ran aground from the coast. It was transporting 800 containers, of which three were environmentally hazardous, and the vessel was filled with two thousand tons of fuel oil. The tugboats &quot;São Luís&quot; (from the port of Horta) and &quot;São Miguel&quot; (from the port of Ponta Delgada) were called out to assist the crippled vessel, and were later aided by the Russian tug &quot;Fortiy Frilov&quot; (in order to stabilize the ship in northerly swells). However, the bay&#x27;s currents forced the ship further to shore, forcing the abandonment of the ship on 25 December. The hulls eventually breached, causing an oil spill into the bay and onto the beach at Fajã. Similarly, some containers containing toxic fire retardant, flammable ink and paint and sodium persulphate were affected, and several containers were damaged or destroyed during the incident, leaking their contents into the bay. In the report on the accident, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch noted several failures including lack of crew management and procedures on the part of the operator, the inexperience and lack of seamanship of the master, and lack of proper nautical charts and anchoring experience. The accident brought world attention to Fajã da Praia, Faial and the Azores.

==Geography==
The parish is part of the Capelo Volcanic Complex, a geologic area of layered ash and pyroclastic deposits produced less than 10,000 years ago. The rural town occupies the space along the regional roadway, while summer homes and some permanent residents occupy the &quot;fajã&quot; along the coast, known as &quot;Fajã da Praia do Norte&quot;.

A &quot;fajã&quot; is the term used to define a small extension of land, located along the ocean, formed from rock debris or a volcanic delta from lava meeting the ocean. The bay in &quot;Fajã&quot; is protected cove, sheltered by steep arriba covered in Laurasilva forest, that developed from the historic eruption of Cabeço do Fogo (1672-1673). The geological formation and the existence of a micro-climate allows human habitation, making it an ideal destination for tourists and local summer homes, as well as the &quot;adega&quot; wine cellars. A small beach, from which the name &quot;Praia do Norte&quot; originates, provides an area of activities along its several metres of dark sand areal during the summer. But, the beach is primarily popular with surfers, since offshore conditions allow for large waves throughout the year. The eastern portion of the parish is a tall and abrupt cliff that is connected to Cedros plateau.

Along the shoreline is also a nascent port, formed by a lava flow resulting in the formation of Xenoliths. With little more than 30 inhabitants, the focus of the small community is the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Penha de França, constructed in 1787.

==Economy==
Following the Cabeço do Fogo eruption, much of the lands in the parish were sterile and uncultivatable due to the ash. Gradually, agriculture returned to the area, although the region has been affected by the collapses in the wine, orange and potato crises during the 19-20th century. Cattle and dairy production are one of the two pillars of the economy today. The residents of the parish also rely on fishing, some boat construction and rock/sand extraction as basic sources of income. Although tourism is not an obvious cash stream, the area has unspoiled coastal areas, panoramic views towards Capelo (visible from &quot;Ribeira das Cabres&quot;) and high cliffs that attract or stop visitors regularly in the area.

==Culture==
The feast day of its patron saint, dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora das Dores&quot;, is celebrated on the Sunday following September 15. It chapel was constructed twice: in 1797, following its destruction by Cabeço do Fogo in 1672; and in 1961, following its destruction during the Capelinhos eruption. The feast days of St. Peter (29 June) are celebrated in Fajã, and Our Lady of Penafrancia (8 September) at its chapel built in 1787.

The area is known for many of the same agricultural dishes emblematic of this region, including a pork stew, its wine (produced from the many rock vineyards of the Fajã) and a traditional corn flat-bread.
