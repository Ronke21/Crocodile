<text>Edward Lovett Pearce (1699 – 7 December 1733) was an Irish architect, and the chief exponent of Palladianism in Ireland. He is thought to have initially studied as an architect under his father&#x27;s first cousin, Sir John Vanbrugh. He is best known for the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin, and his work on Castletown House. The architectural concepts he employed on both civic and private buildings were to change the face of architecture in Ireland. He could be described as the father of Irish Palladian architecture and Georgian Dublin.

== Early life ==

Edward Lovett Pearce was born about 1699 in County Meath and was the only child of General Edward Pearce from Whitlingham, Norfolk, a first cousin of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh, and Frances, daughter of Christopher Lovett, Lord Mayor of Dublin 1676–77 and previously a merchant in Turkey. In that same year Vanbrugh was beginning work on his first great architectural commission of Castle Howard which was the first truly baroque house in England, ironically Vanbrugh&#x27;s new cousin was to be one of the leading architects whose designs were to overthrow the baroque fashion less than 28 years later.

In 1715 following the death of his father, Pearce became a pupil of his eminent architect cousin, it is therefore likely that Pearce would have had the opportunity to see first hand and study the plans and building of Blenheim Palace, where work, following the death of Queen Anne, had just restarted, and was midway through its fraught and frequently interrupted construction. It seems though, that at this age Pearce was still uncertain if he wanted an architectural career, as aged 17 he joined the army serving as a cornet in the dragoons under the command of a Colonel Morris.

Following his time in the army, he decided circa 1722, to return to his first career and again began to study architecture, he did this by studying the architectural masterpieces of France and Italy. However it was in the Veneto that he found the style of architecture which was to influence him most. He made detailed drawings of many of the great villas designed by Palladio which were to serve as the inspiration for his later work. He met in Italy the Florentine architect Alessandro Galilei, who was working from afar on a vast grandiose mansion near Dublin – Castletown.

He spent some time in Norfolk in the 1720s, where he carried out a number of architectural commissions for local families including for the original iteration of Shadwell Court (1727–29) along with his distant relative, the amateur architect John Buxton.

About 1725 Edward married Ann, his own first-cousin, daughter of General Thomas Pearce and Mary Hewes. They were to have four daughters who inherited great-grandfather Pearce&#x27;s manor of Whitlingham by Norwich, Norfolk. They were: Mary, Mrs Lewis Thomas then Mrs James Slator but mother of Major-General Lewis Thomas; Anne, Mrs Chambre Hallowes; Frances, Mrs Benjamin Lake; and Henrietta, Mrs Charles Willington. He remained a captain in Colonel Clement Neville&#x27;s Dragoons.

== Architectural career ==

By 1724, Pearce had returned to Ireland to become a practising architect in Dublin, It would appear that as the only Irish architect, at the time, to have studied in Italy, his classical concepts were to win him instant recognition, his architectural success seems to have been almost instantaneous; no doubt helped by his contacts and position in Irish society and even more undoubtedly by his association with William Conolly and Castletown.

During the 1730s Lovett Pearce employed William Halfpenny as an assistant and he used the alias Michael Hoare while travelling throughout Ireland.

=== Castletown ===

Castletown House is the largest and one of the most important country houses in Ireland, it also claims to be the house which introduced Palladianism to Ireland. The mansion was commissioned by William Conolly (1662–1729), a self-made man who had risen from humble origins through astute property dealings to become one of the wealthiest and influential men in Ireland. The original plans were drawn by Alessandro Galilei circa 1718, the new mansion was intended to reflect Conolly&#x27;s political power as Lord Justice of Ireland. Galilei though returned to Italy in 1719, having drawn the plans, but not waiting to see building on the Castletown site commence. In fact work was not to start until 1722. For two years, the project seems to have continued unsupervised, until in 1724, it was taken over by the twenty-five-year-old Edward Lovett Pearce. Just returned to Ireland from Italy, it is likely that Pearce had been working on the plans with Galilei there. Hence Pierce&#x27;s connection with Castletown probably predates his return to Ireland. It is possible that it was to oversee the building of Castletown that provided Pearce with the impetus to return home to Ireland. Building at Castletown was to continue for the rest of Pearce&#x27;s life.

It is not known precisely how much of Castletown is Galilei&#x27;s work and how much Pearce&#x27;s. If in Italy Pearce had been employed by Galilei and worked on the plans, then, as was the custom of the time, Pearce&#x27;s work as an employee would have been credited to his master. Galilei was certainly responsible for devising the overall scheme of a principal centre mansion, flanked by colonnades leading to two service wings, in the true Palladian manner. Castletown was the first house in Ireland designed with this layout. The rigid symmetry of Castletown&#x27;s classical façades, designed by Galilei was to be typical too of Pearce&#x27;s later work.

The interiors and final room plans are believed to be the work of Pearce, however the long suite of reception rooms along the ground-floor garden front, are not in the strict Palladian tradition. Such a mansion as Castletown, in Italy, would have been a town Palazzo rather than a country villa. The long suite of room with a central salon, terminating with smaller rooms at the end of the enfilade is more typical of the suites of state rooms in English country houses at the time. The central saloon at Castletown opens into the two-storey entrance hall, which is traversed by a corridor running the length of the mansion; the principal staircase is situated in an adjoining hall to the side of the great hall. In this layout of state rooms, hall and staircase Castletown is similar to Blenheim Palace, which Pearce had studied while a student of Vanbrugh. (While Pearce designed the staircase it was not actually constructed until 1760, some 28 years after his death.)

=== Bellamont House ===

Another of Pearce&#x27;s earliest commissions occurred when he was commissioned by his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law Thomas Coote to build Bellamont House, also known as Bellamont Forest, on the outskirts of Cootehill in the north-east of County Cavan. This family connection was not unusual, as several of Pearce&#x27;s clients were related to him. Like Castletown, Bellamont claims to be Ireland&#x27;s first Palladian house. Dates attributed to the design range from 1725 to 1730, whatever the date (1725 is probable) it is almost certain that this was the first of Ireland&#x27;s many Palladian houses to be completed. The four bays square modestly sized mansion is clearly inspired by Palladio&#x27;s Villa Capra. The principal façade has as its ground floor a rusticated semi-basement, above which is the piano nobile at the centre is a four columned portico with a pediment, the portico is flanked by a single high sash window on each side. The main entrance beneath the one-storey portico is reached by a single flight of broad steps. Above the piano nobile is a secondary floor with windows exactly half the size of those below. The entire façade is just four windows wide. The composition is a hybrid between the grandest of the Veneto&#x27;s villas and a slightly exalted farmhouse, which ironically was the very intention of Palladio&#x27;s original designs 200 years previously. While Castletown is a symbol or wealth and power, the far smaller Bellamont is the greater symbol of Palladianism and architectural perfection. Also during this period of his work Pearce redesigned the south elevation of Drumcondra House (now All Hallows Campus, Dublin).

=== Stillorgan Obelisk ===

Following a famine in 1727, an Obelisk at Stillorgan, attributed to Pearce, was erected as a memorial to those who had perished. This granite monument, over 100 feet high, contains in its base a large vaulted hall from which rises a staircase leading to a viewing platform. The attribution to Pearce is probable, although the monument is in an almost avant-garde neoclassical style, with Egyptian influences; however Pearce was living in the parish at this time in a house known as The Grove. This large house (subsequently known as Tigh Lorcain Hall) was replaced by the Stillorgan Bowling Alley in 1963.

=== Irish Parliament House ===

In 1727, Pearce was elected member of parliament in the Irish House of Commons for the Ratoath in County Meath, assisted by his patron Speaker Conolly, for whom he was continuously working at Castletown. The Irish Government had decided in that same year to replace their existing meeting place at Chichester House, College Green, Dublin with a new purpose-built parliament building. It was Speaker Conolly who first suggested building the new Parliament House on College Green, therefore it is unsurprising, perhaps, that it was Pearce the member of parliament (MP) and employee of Conolly who was eventually chosen to design the project.

The foundation stone of the new Parliament building was laid in 1729, the Palladian design was, as intended, awe inspiring with a huge colonnade facing onto College Green. The two legislator Houses of Parliament contained an octagonal classical temple, complete with Pantheon-style dome, as its House of Commons, (destroyed by fire in 1792). The public gallery here could hold up to 700 spectators, symbolising true open government; the smaller but still exquisite House of Lords survives, along with its central arcade and pediment. The building at the beginning of the 19th century was taken over by the Bank of Ireland, substantial alterations have been made since, including a large extension by Gandon and Johnson. A condition of the sale to the bank was that all signs of Parliament were to be removed. However, the concepts of Pearce are still very evident in the surviving House of Lords.

=== Cashel Palace ===

As architect of the Parliament building, in 1730 Pearce was appointed Surveyor General of Ireland, he succeeded Thomas Burgh. This important position, a mere four years after his return from Italy was the seal on his success. While work was continuing on the parliament building in 1730 Pierce, now Ireland&#x27;s most famed and sought after architect, was commissioned by Archbishop Theophilus Bolton to build the new bishop&#x27;s palace, at Cashel, in County Tipperary. The result was a large unostentatious red brick Palladian mansion, on two principal floors, the hipped roof hidden by a brick pediment, the main façade seven bays long had at its centre a three bayed projection, the only ornament was dressed stone double strapping indicating the ground and first floor division. On the ground floor the terminating two bays were replaced by venetian windows. The result was a house of restrained refinement. Pearce also designed the landscaping of the grounds of the palace complete with their private path to Rock of Cashel. The Cashel Palace Hotel now operates from the property.

=== Desart Court ===

Desart Court was constructed in 1733 for the first Lord Desart, John Cuffe. It was a five-bay 2 storey house with a basement. It was ultimately destroyed in a fire by the IRA in 1923.

===Other buildings===

Among other buildings that Lovett Pearce supposedly designed are

*Stables at Dartrey Estate
*Deanery House off Fishamble Street (demolished 1886)
*Gloster House, County Offaly
*Woodlands house in Clonshaugh
*Drumcondra House,
*9 and 10 Henrietta Street and possibly other houses on the Street.
*Summerhill House, County Meath
*Shadwell Court, Norfolk, England (1727–29)

== Legacy ==

Following the acclaim given to the new Parliament building, the structure was near enough completed in 1731 for Parliament to be held there, in 1732 Pearce was knighted, this honour was followed by the freedom of the city of Dublin in 1733. Sir Edward Lovett Pearce was then at the height of his success and popularity. In addition to the better known works described above Pearce worked on numerous other commissions, a vast mansion known at Summerhill House in County Meath (demolished in the 1950s) was attributed to him, although his contemporary, the architect Richard Cassels is thought to have overseen this work.

Pearce also designed smaller and more modest town houses for the wealthy and aristocratic of Dublin; two examples of his work survive in Henrietta Street (illustrated above right). His design at No.9 was for his first cousin Mrs Thomas Carter.

Tragically it was to be a short period, within weeks of receiving the freedom of Dublin, he was struck down with an abscess and died of septicaemia 16 November 1733 at his home, The Grove, Stillorgan, aged just 34. His remains were buried on 10 December 1733 in St Mary&#x27;s Graveyard, Donnybrook. His widow and four children survived him. Ann died at her house in St Stephen&#x27;s Green Dublin on 15 July 1749 and was buried at Donnybrook on 17 July 1749.

Edward Lovett Pearce&#x27;s rise had been meteoric; in just six years of architectural practice he had scaled the greatest heights of both private and civic architectural practice. He had introduced Palladianism to a country which was to adopt it with a gusto unlike any other European country. At the time of his death he presided over an entire community of Palladian architects perpetuating his interpretations of Palladio&#x27;s work throughout Ireland.

<text>Justin Ross Yoder (November 9, 1986 – September 15, 2024) was an American soapbox racer. He was the first child with a disability to drive a soapbox in the All American Soapbox Derby. In 1996, he challenged the regulations to allow children with disabilities to use a hand brake instead of the required foot brake. Thanks to him, regulations were changed. The hand brake is now called the Justin Brake in his honor.

Yoder had spina bifida and hydrocephalus. His story is told in the film &quot;Miracle in Lane 2&quot; starring Frankie Muniz.

Yoder was a Mennonite and attended the same church as the film&#x27;s screenwriters Don Yost and Joel Kauffmann.

Yoder was a student at Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana, and majored in American Sign Language Interpreting.

Yoder was involved in a serious car collision on September 14, 2024, after another driver being pursued by police at high speed struck the vehicle in which Yoder was riding. He died the following day from his injuries, at the age of 37.

<text>Onkaparinga River Recreation Park is a protected area occupying land in the estuary of the Onkaparinga River in South Australia. The recreation park which was established in 1985 is approximately from Adelaide city centre. It is the venue for recreational activities such as walking, canoeing, kayaking, recreational fishing and picnics.

==Description==
The recreation park occupies the majority of the portion of the river&#x27;s catchment area between Main South Road near Old Noarlunga in the east and Commercial and Saltfleet Roads at Port Noarlunga in the west. The occupied land is located within the following suburbs in the City of Onkaparinga: Noarlunga Downs, Port Noarlunga South and Seaford Meadows. 
A combined pedestrian/cycle track known as the Coast to Vines Rail Trail has an easement that passes through the recreation park on its east side following the alignment of the former Willunga railway line. The Seaford railway line passes over the recreation park on a elevated bridge (known as the Onkaparinga Valley Bridge) which was built between 2011 and 2014. It is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

==History==
Most of the land now dedicated to the recreation park was purchased in the period 1973 to 1977 by a former SA government agency, the State Planning Authority. The purpose of the land acquisition which included land along the full length of Onkaparinga River was threefold. Firstly, it was ‘to provide open space for recreational purposes’, secondly, ‘to preserve the natural character of the landscape, including the native flora and fauna’ and thirdly, ‘to function as a buffer between areas of urban and rural land.’ In 1982, the majority of the land was transferred to the then Department for Environment and Heritage which established the recreation park in 1985. In 1993, all of the land east of Main South Road (known as the gorge section’) was reclassified as the Onkaparinga River National Park. For managerial and administrative purposes, the recreation park and the national park are known collectively as the ‘Onkaparinga River Reserve’.

==Prior use of the land==
===Aboriginal use===
As of 2004, radiocarbon dating of material recovered via archaeological excavation from known Aboriginal sites in the river&#x27;s estuary suggest continuous use of the land prior to European colonisation for as long ago as 7,500 years BP.

===European use===
Land in the locality including the Onkaparinga floodplain was surveyed and became available for selection in February 1839. Most of the land in the recreation park was a farm originally purchased about 1861 by John Jared, an immigrant who arrived from Lincolnshire, England. The original purchase of was expanded to . Jared named the farm ‘Clear Farm’ and built a house on the property in 1862. Jared was succeeded in 1871 by his son, John William, who renamed the property ‘Pringle Farm’. The property remained in the Jared family until the 1970s when it was purchased by the State Planning Authority. The remains of Pringle Farm which was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 11 April 1996 are conserved within the recreation park.

==Recreational uses==
The recreation park features a system of walking tracks. Two are named and signposted: the Wetlands Walk on the north side of the river and the Pringle Farm Walk on the south side of the river. Canoeing, kayaking and recreational fishing is permitted in the waters of the Onkaparinga River within the recreation park&#x27;s boundaries. Dogs are permitted in the recreation park, but must be kept on a leash at all times. Vehicle parking areas, toilets and a picnic ground are provided both within the recreation park and just outside its boundaries.
A recreational airfield of length which is known as the Old Noarlunga Airfield is located in the south east corner of the recreation park. It is leased by two organisations, the South Coast Flying Club Inc and the Noarlunga Model Aero Sports Inc, for flying respectively vintage aircraft and model aircraft.

==Associated protected areas==
The full extent of the River Onkaparinga from the recreational park&#x27;s eastern boundary at Old Noarlunga to its western boundary at Port Noarlunga is part of both the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve and the Encounter Marine Park. With respect to the aquatic reserve, the only permitted fishing activity is ‘line fishing and hand net fishing for bait shrimp only’.

<doc id="1168424" wikidata="Q248741" url="?curid=1168424" title="Aki Riihilahti">
<text>Aki Pasinpoika Riihilahti (born 9 September 1976) is a Finnish sports executive and a former professional footballer. He was known as a hard working defensive midfielder. He is the CEO of HJK Helsinki. He was voted by leading European clubs to be the vice-chairman of European Club Association (ECA), and has also important positions both in the UEFA club competition committee and in the FIFA stakeholders committee.

== Club career ==
Riihilahti started his career at HJK where he made his Veikkausliiga debut in 1995. He has won the Finnish championship four times (1997, 2009, 2010 and 2011), the Finnish Cup three times with HJK, and the Finnish League Cup three times, and played a vital part when the first and so far only time a Finnish Club team qualified for the UEFA Champions League in the 1998–99 season. After his first spell in HJK, Riihilahti moved to Norway&#x27;s Vålerenga I.F. for the 1999 season.

After two seasons in Norway, he joined England&#x27;s Crystal Palace in 2001, eventually becoming a fans&#x27; favourite at the club. In Palace&#x27;s 2004–05 Premier League season he showed he has what it takes to play in one of Europe&#x27;s top leagues. Riihilahti was so loved by the Crystal Palace faithful that a Finnish flag with the legend &#x27;AKI 15&#x27; across the centre was hung behind one of the Selhurst Park goals for the entire Premier League season. However, his next season, back in the Championship, following Palace&#x27;s relegation, was not so successful because injuries limited his chances. Despite not playing for most of his last season with Palace, Riihilahti has a place in the club Hall of Fame as he held the club record for gaining the most caps for his country whilst at Palace.

After his contract with Palace expired in the summer of 2006, Riihilahti was picked up by 1. FC Kaiserslautern on a one-year deal. In June 2007, Riihilahti signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Stockholm club Djurgårdens IF and on 31 July 2009 returned to Finland to sign with HJK in which he has made a crucial contribution in the club&#x27;s record 5 consecutive championships 2009–2013. On 29 October 2011, Riihilahti celebrated his 100th league match for HJK by scoring once, in the last match of the season, in a 5–2 home win against Haka, and retired after the club won a convincing double that season.

== International career ==
Riihilahti made his debut for the Finnish national team on 5 February 1998 against Cyprus. He was a regular for Finland for most of the 2000s, and earned 69 caps scoring 11 goals.
He is part of the Finnish Golden generation in football, but mainly due to his work as football director at International level he has become one of the most well-known Finnish football person.

== Administrative career ==

Riihilahti has worked as the CEO of HJK Helsinki&#x27;s stadium Bolt Arena since 2011 and as the CEO of HJK Helsinki since 2013. He graduated from the MBA program of University of Liverpool in 2011 and has done some studies in Harvard University and Yale University as well.

Riihilahti had a key role in establishment of the UEFA Europa Conference League which started during the 2021-2022 season.

== Personal life ==
During his career Riihilahti has written columns for newspapers, such as &quot;The Times&quot; and the Finnish &quot;Iltalehti&quot;. 
He has also been involved in many good charity projects like ’&#x27;Icehearts&quot; and ’&#x27;Peace United&quot;.

Apart from his careers in sports and media he has been involved in many high profile political and business committees.
Riihilahti divorced 2019 and is a father of two children.
Riihilahti married his Tanssii Tähtien kanssa-dance partner, Katri Mäkinen in 2023. Katri gave birth to her first (Aki&#x27;s 3rd) child on 2 September 2024.

He is the older brother of Finnish TV and sports reporter Riku Riihilahti, and the uncle of professional footballer Daniel Riihilahti, playing in Brann II.

<doc id="1168429" wikidata="Q3007362" url="?curid=1168429" title="Culture of Nicaragua">
<text>Culture of Nicaragua is a fusion of Mesoamerican, Chibcha, and Spanish influence. The western part was colonized by the Spanish and its culture is similar to western El Salvador in that western Nicaragua was dominated by the Nahua people, specifically the Nicarao, a branch of the Pipil people. Nahua heritage can still be seen in Nicaraguan culture especially in its cuisines, the etymologies of many of its place names, and even DNA analysis. While western Nicaragua is mostly Indigenous of Nahua or Oto-manguean origin, eastern Nicaragua is mostly of Chibcha, Miskito, and African origin.

The northern region, however, is inhabited by Indigenous people and descendants of Europeans, mostly of German and Spanish descent.

==Culture and language==
Music and religious icons find their roots in Iberian culture and Amerindian sounds and flavors. The west of Nicaragua was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking American countries. The eastern half of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate, and English is spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of former and present British colonies in the Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Belize, the Cayman Islands, etc. 
Recent immigration by Spanish speakers has largely influenced younger generations, and an increasing number of people are either bilingual at home or speak Spanish only. In eastern Nicaragua there is a relatively large population of people of mixed African descent, as well as a smaller Garifuna population.

Due to the African influence in the East Coast, there exists a different kind of music. It is the popular dance music called &#x27;Palo de Mayo&#x27;, or Maypole, which is celebrated during the Maypole Festival, during the month of May. The music is sensual with intense rhythms. The celebration is derived from the British Maypole for May Day celebration, as adapted and transformed by the Afro-Nicaraguans on the Caribbean or Mosquito Coast.

Of the many cultures that were present before European colonization, the Nahua and Oto-mangue peoples who populated the western half of the country have been assimilated into the mainstream culture for the most part, blending into the mestizo population. In the east, however, several Chibcha groups have maintained a distinct identity as well as the preservation of their languages, such as the Rama and the Sumo. The Miskito and Garifuna also have their original languages preserved, in addition to having the ability to usually speak Spanish and English.

==Language==
Spanish, or Nicañol as Nicaraguan Spanish is sometimes referred to, is spoken by 90% of the country&#x27;s population. In the Caribbean coast many afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language. Also in the Caribbean coast, many Indigenous people speak their native languages, such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language.

In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua, such as the Chinese Nicaraguans and Palestinian Nicaraguans, have maintained their ancestral languages, which are minority languages, while also speaking Spanish and/or English. These minority languages include Chinese, Arabic, German, and Italian, among others. Nicaragua was home to 3 extinct languages, one of which was never classified. Nicaraguan Sign Language is also of particular interest to linguists.

Central American Spanish is spoken by about 90% of the country&#x27;s population. In Nicaragua, the voseo form of Spanish is dominant in both speech and publications. The first nation to formally adopt the voseo dialect, Nicaragua is one of two Central American nations (Costa Rica is the other) that use voseo Spanish as its written and spoken form of the language. The usage is also seen in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and coastal Colombia.

In the Caribbean coast, many Afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language, but they speak a very fluent Spanish as a second language. The languages in the North and South Atlantic Regions are influenced by English, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Many of the indigenous people on the Caribbean coast speak native languages such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language. In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua have maintained their ancestral languages, while also speaking Spanish or English; these include Chinese, Arabic, Italian, and German.

Spanish is taught as the principal language. English is taught to students during their high school years and tends to be the national second language. Other languages, particularly Romance languages, can be found sporadically.

===Phonetics and phonology===

Some characteristics of Nicaraguan phonology include:
* /s/ at the end of a syllable or before a consonant is pronounced like [h].
* /j/ (/x/) is aspirated; it is soft like the /h/ in English (e.g.: Yahoo).
* There is no confusion between /l/ and /r/, as in the Caribbean.
* /s/, /z/ and in some cases /c/ (as in &quot;cerrar&quot;) are pronounced as [s]

==Religion==

Religion is a significant part of the culture of Nicaragua and forms part of the constitution. Religious freedom, which has been guaranteed since 1939, and religious tolerance is promoted by both the Nicaraguan government and the constitution. Bishops are expected to lend their authority to important state occasions, and their pronouncements on national issues are closely followed. They can also be called upon to mediate between contending parties at moments of political crisis.

Although Nicaragua has no official religion it is nominally Roman Catholic. Practicing Roman Catholics are no longer the majority and are declining while evangelical Protestant groups and membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are growing rapidly have been growing since the 1990s. There are also strong Anglican and Moravian communities on the Caribbean coast.

Roman Catholicism came to Nicaragua in the sixteenth century with the Spanish conquest and remained until 1939 the established faith. Protestantism and other Christian sects came to Nicaragua during the nineteenth century, but only during the twentieth century have Protestant denominations gained large followings in the Caribbean Coast of the country. Popular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intermediaries between human beings and God.

Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honor patron saints selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual &quot;fiestas&quot;. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua&#x27;s Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honored in August with two colorful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua&#x27;s religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Purísima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, during which elaborate altars to the Virgin Mary are constructed in homes and workplaces.

==Music==
Modern Nicaraguan music of Indigenous and especially Spanish influences. Musical instruments include the marimba and others common across Central America.

Marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and Guallatiri (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers.

The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music that is especially loud and celebrated during the May Palo de Mayo festival. The Garifuna community exists in Nicaragua and is known for its popular music called Punta. Also, soca music, reggaeton and reggae are popular throughout the country.

==Education==
Education is free for all Nicaraguans. Elementary education is free and compulsory, however, many children in rural areas are unable to attend due to lack of schools and other reasons. Communities located on the Caribbean coast have access to education in their native languages. The majority of higher education institutions are located in Managua, higher education has financial, organic and administrative autonomy, according to the law. Also, freedom of subjects is recognized.

Nicaragua&#x27;s higher education consists of 48 universities and 113 colleges and technical institutes which serve student in the areas of electronics, computer systems and sciences, agroforestry, construction and trade-related services. The educational system includes 1 U.S. accredited English-language university, 3 Bilingual university programs, 5 Bilingual secondary schools and dozens of English Language Institutes. In 2005, almost 400,000 (7%) of Nicaraguans held a university degree. 18% of Nicaragua&#x27;s total budget is invested in primary, secondary and higher education. University level institutions account for 6% of 18%.

When the Sandinistas came to power in 1979, they inherited an educational system that was one of the poorest in Latin America. Under the Somozas, limited spending on education and generalized poverty, which forced many adolescents into the labor market, constricted educational opportunities for Nicaraguans. A 1980 literacy campaign, using secondary school students, university students as well as teachers as volunteer teachers, reduced the overall illiteracy rate from 50.3% to 12.9% within only five months. The key large scale programs of the Sandinistas included a massive National Literacy Crusade (March–August, 1980), social program, which received international recognition for their gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform. In September 1980, UNESCO awarded Nicaragua with the &quot;Nadezhda K. Krupskaya&quot; award for their successful literacy campaign. This was followed by the literacy campaigns of 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995 and 2000, all of which were also awarded by UNESCO.

==Literature==

Nicaraguan literature can be traced to pre-Columbian times with the myths and oral literature that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as Rubén Darío who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua, referred to as the &quot;Father of Modernism&quot; for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century.

Other literary figures include Ernesto Cardenal, Gioconda Belli, Claribel Alegría and José Coronel Urtecho, Alfredo Alegría Rosales, Carlos Martínez Rivas, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Manolo Cuadra, Pablo Alberto Cuadra Arguello, Sergio Ramírez among others.

===&quot;El Güegüense&quot;===

&quot;El Güegüense&quot; is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of the pre-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America&#x27;s most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua&#x27;s signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater. El Güegüense is performed during the feast of San Sebastián in Diriamba (Carazo Department) from January 17 to the 27th.

The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere. It was passed down orally for many centuries until it was finally written down and published into a book in 1942.

El Güegüense represents folklore of Nicaragua, therefore, UNESCO proclaimed it a &quot;Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; in 2005 making Nicaragua the only country in Central America and one of six in Latin America to have 2 proclaimed masterpieces by UNESCO. The first proclaimed masterpiece was the &quot;Oral traditions and expressions&quot; of the Garifuna.

==Legends==
Nicaraguans legends are similar to those found in other Latin American countries. Some popular legends include:

* La Mocuana -- The Nicaraguan folkloric legend of La Mocuana is believed to be based on genuine history and it is thought that La Mocuana was a living Indian princess. Her father was hospitable to the Spanish conquerors at first but then ordered them to leave. Soon the Spanish forces returned to take over the village and take their gold. The chief of the village had hidden the treasure and his daughter, La Mocuana, was the only other individual who knew its whereabouts. During a battle between the two groups the tribe gained victory. Some time later the son of one of the Spanish soldiers came to live near the village and soon fell in love with La Mocuana. She too fell in love with him and they planned to run away together. She gave him her father’s treasure so that they could have something for their lives together. The Spaniard preferred to keep the gold for himself and sealed La Mocuana in a cave, running away with the treasure. La Mocuana escaped through the back of the cave. The heartbroken princess began to wander the woods and was driven mad by the thoughts of betrayal and feelings of guilt. Country people say that her sad figure can be seen on dark nights. She is also said to lure drunkards and philanderers to her cave where they disappear.

*El Cadejo – There is a good white cadejo and an evil black cadejo. Both are spirits that appear at night to travellers. The white cadejo to protect them from harm during their journey, and the black cadejo (sometimes an incarnation of the devil) to kill them. The cadejos usually appear in the form of a large, cow-sized shaggy dog with burning red eyes and a goat&#x27;s hooves, although in some areas they have more bull-like characteristics. According to the stories, those who have attempted to kill the black cadejo have failed and perished.
*La Cegua – Also called Cihuanaba, &quot;Cegua&quot; is probably a romanization of the nahuatl &quot;Cihua&quot; which means &quot;woman&quot;. La Cegua is a witch who resides in the woods. She takes on several facades. At times she appears in a white corn leaf dress with a veil covering her face. It is said that she has long black hair covering over her face. She is also said to wear a Guarumo Tree leaf dress and her voice is made rasping and hollow by plantain leaves covering her teeth. Others say that her face is ghostly and that her eyes stare into her victim&#x27;s souls. Still another version says that she is believed to have the face of a horse. Nicaraguans also say that she walks through the woods and back roads naked, waiting for her next victim. Men are drawn to her fantastical silhouette. The words she speaks to these men are so horrific that the victim goes insane instantaneously – something from which they never recover. La Cegua is believed to have super-human abilities and is able to walk through solid objects, gravitate above ground and fly at extreme speeds in her efforts to lure men into her trap. To save yourself from such an encounter you should carry mustard seeds and throw them before her. She apparently will stop to try and pick up the magical seeds. As with other myths in Nicaraguan folklore, the tale of La Cegua is believed to ensure that men come straight home after work.
*La Llorona – Sometimes called the Woman in White or the Weeping Woman is the ghost of a woman crying for her dead children. Her appearances are sometimes held to presage death.
*La Novia de Tola (&quot;The bride from Tola&quot;) – Apocryphal legend of a maiden who went insane after her fiancé stood her up at the altar. In current usage, to say that someone was &quot;left like the bride from Tola&quot; is a uniquely Nicaraguan idiom meaning that someone was stood up or left &quot;holding the bag&quot;. The city of Tola in the department of Rivas, Nicaragua erected a statue in the town square to honor the legendary bride.
*La Carreta Nagua – An old Nicaraguan folk tale about a haunted cart that is driven by Death and pulled by two skeletal oxen. It could supposedly be heard at night because of the sound of chains it made being dragged along the streets. If the &quot;Carreta Nagua&quot; stops at one&#x27;s home, surely a resident is to die. The old tale is believed to have been established by the indigenous people of Nicaragua, who would be kidnapped by the Spaniards, chained onto ox-driven carts and taken to work the mines. There they would die and not be seen again until their corpses were driven on those same carts to be disposed of. Such carts became a symbol of death and when heard approaching, the indigenous people would flee into the woods.
*La Taconuda – The legend of a woman whose fiancé stood her up at the altar. People say that her ghost walks around the city of Leon Nicaragua searching for her fiancé or other young lonely men. She is called la taconuda for wearing giant heels.

<text>Rondebosch is one of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa. It is primarily a residential suburb, with shopping and business districts as well as the main campus of the University of Cape Town.

==History==

Four years after the first Dutch settlement at the Cape in 1652, the first experimental crops were grown along the banks of the Liesbeek River (at that stage called the Amstel or Versse Rivier). In October 1656, Jan van Riebeeck visited Rondeboschyn, whose name derived from a contraction of &quot;&quot;Ronde Doorn Bossien&quot;,&quot; referring to a circular grove of thorn trees growing on the banks of the Liesbeek River. By 1670 the area&#x27;s name had been shortened to &quot;Rondeboschje&quot; in the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s (VOC) records.

In 1657, the first group of VOC employees gained free burgher status, four of whom were granted land along the river and founded &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Colony&quot; in the area now known as Rondebosch. The first permanent title of land in southern Africa was issued, by Van Riebeeck, to the four free burghers of Rondebosch.

The area only obtained recognition as a separate village or area of Cape Town after the 1830s. In 1864 the area was connected by railway upon the competition of the Cape Town to Wynberg line. By the time of the 1875 census Rondebosch had a recorded population of 1,902 residents. The 1891 census recorded a population of 3,378, and by the time of the 1904 Cape census the area had a total population of 6,035, of whom 4,312 were recorded as being literate.

One of Cape Town&#x27;s first municipal electricity stations was built in 1892 to supply power to the Rondebosch area, replacing the old oil street lamps with electric ones.

On 4 May 1990 the &#x27;Groote Schuur Minute’ was co-signed in Rondebosch by the then leader of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela, and then State President of South Africa, FW de Klerk, as a commitment to a peaceful negotiation process to end Apartheid. Thereby starting the process to peacefully transition to South Africa&#x27;s modern democracy.

==Geography==
Rondebosch lies between the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak in the west and the M5 freeway in the east; it is one of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, which lie along the eastern slope of the Table Mountain massif. The suburb&#x27;s western border with the Table Mountain National Park is defined by the M3 freeway. To the north are the suburbs of Rosebank and Mowbray, while to the south are Newlands and Claremont. The eastern border of Rondebosch is the M5 freeway; beyond the freeway are Sybrand Park, Athlone and Rondebosch East.

The Southern Line railway divides Rondebosch in two; the only road within Rondebosch that crosses the railway is the Belmont Road bridge. Main Road (the M4) runs north-south through the area west of the railway, while Campground Road runs in the same direction east of the railway. The third north-south through route is Milner Road, further east close to the M5.

The area around the intersection of Main Road and Belmont Road is Rondebosch&#x27;s main commercial area, with several small shopping malls and two supermarkets. Also located in this area is Rondebosch railway station, which is the main public transport facility in the suburb. A smaller commercial area lies just to the east on the corner of Belmont and Campground Roads; there is also a row of shops along Belvedere Road in the southeastern part of the suburb. The rest of the suburb is used for educational and residential purposes, with the residential areas being generally denser further to the west where the influence of the University of Cape Town is felt.

Two canalised streams run from the slopes of Table Mountain through Rondebosch; the Liesbeeck River runs northwards between Main Road and the railway, while the Black River runs in a northeasterly direction through the eastern part of the suburb. The terrain is generally flat east of the railway line, while to the west it slopes upwards towards Devil&#x27;s Peak.

The flower &quot;Erica turgida,&quot; was endemic in area between Rondebosch, Kenilworth and Wynberg before becoming extinct in the wild.

===Landmarks===
On the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak above Rondebosch is the main campus of the University of Cape Town.

The historic Groote Schuur estate in Rondebosch includes presidential and ministerial residences with Cape Dutch origins. The Groote Schuur building is the biggest, rebuilt by Cecil Rhodes according to a design by Herbert Baker after a fire in 1896. The presidential residence, Genadendal (formerly Westbrooke), also dates back to Cape Dutch times. &quot;The Woolsack&quot; is a historic house within the grounds of the University of Cape Town that is now used as student housing. Previously part of Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s estate at Groote Schuur, it was frequently used by the famous British poet and author Ruyard Kipling when he used to visit Cape Town for his winter holidays between 1898 and 1908.

The home of Simon van der Stel (first governor of the Cape Colony) is now part of Rustenburg Junior School. This building dates back to the 17th century, although it has undergone many alterations over the years. Its summer house, dating from 1760, remains as a monument just below the university. Other historic buildings in the area include the Rondebosch Town Hall, now occupied by the Rondebosch Library, and St. Paul&#x27;s Church, which was designed by Charles Collier Michell.

Rondebosch Common, once a military campground, is a national monument and an important fynbos conservation area.

The Baxter Theatre in Rondebosch is Cape Town&#x27;s second biggest theatre complex, after the Artscape Theatre Centre in the city centre.

==== Rondebosch Fountain ====
The historic centre of Rondebosch is the Main Road, with the Victorian cast iron Rondebosch Fountain being a historic landmark. Originally known as the Moodie Fountain, it was one of South Africa&#x27;s first electric streetlights. It was built by the Saracen Foundry in Glasgow and presented to the community by George Moodie as a gift in 1891. The lamp was first turned on, on 25 April 1892 and was initially powered by Moodie&#x27;s private power plant until a municipal power plant on the Liesbeeck River was completed. The fountain was destroyed in a road accident in 2015 and rebuilt in 2020.

==Government and politics==
Rondebosch is in the City of Cape Town municipality, within the Protea Sub-Council (Sub-Council 20). The eastern part of the suburb is within ward 58 and the ward councillor is Dr Richard Hill, and the western part is in ward 59 with councillor Mikhail Manuel, both members of the Democratic Alliance.

Rondebosch was the parliamentary seat of Sir De Villiers Graaff, the leader of the opposition United Party, and later that of Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, leader of the opposition Progressive Federal Party.

==Education==
The western part of Rondebosch is dominated by the main campus of the University of Cape Town. Rondebosch is also notable for a high density of schools. Originally the Rondebosch Town Hall the Rondebosch Public Library is a notable landmark in the neighbourhood.

==Sports and recreation==
Western Province Cricket Club is the largest sports facility in Rondebosch, catering for many different sports, including tennis and hockey. The University itself has facilities for most sports. Other facilities include Rondebosch Golf Club and Rygersdal Football Club. Next door to Rondebosch is Newlands, home to the Newlands Stadium for rugby and soccer, and Newlands Cricket Ground.

Parks in Rondebosch include Keurboom Park and Rondebosch Park. Rondebosch Common is also a popular recreational park.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, 14,591 people live in Rondebosch. 62.7% described themselves as &quot;White&quot;, 16.5% as &quot;Black African&quot;, 9.6% as &quot;Coloured&quot; and 6.1% as &quot;Indian or Asian&quot;. The predominant language is English, which is the first language of 84.3% of the population. 7.6% speak Afrikaans and 1.8% speak Xhosa.

In the second half of the 20th century (1950-1991), Rondebosch was a whites-only area in terms of the Group Areas Act, an Apartheid law that enforced segregation.

<doc id="1168432" wikidata="Q829190" url="?curid=1168432" title="Fortifications of Metz">
<text>The fortifications of [[Metz]], a city in northeastern France, are extensive, due to the city&#x27;s strategic position near the border of France and Germany. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the area was annexed by the newly created German Empire in 1871 by the Treaty of Frankfurt and became the &quot;Reichsland&quot; Alsace–Lorraine. The German Army decided to build a fortress line from Mulhouse to Luxembourg to protect their new territories. The centerpiece of this line was the &quot;Moselstellung&quot; between Metz and Thionville, in Lorraine.

==Overview==
The fortifications around Metz consisted of casemates, concrete barracks, infantry strong points, and concrete batteries, equipped with rotating steel turrets (100–150 mm). Each position was surrounded by several ditches, or concrete trenches, with shelters and observation cupolas. A large barbed wire belt, defended by machine gun and rifle positions, completed the defensive system.

Forts had usually several large blockhouse style barracks. These had 3-meter thick reinforced concrete roofs with 2-meter thick walls. They were partially buried under as much as of compacted earth. Tunnels connected all of the structures. The fort also had deep wide trenches, some as much as in both dimensions. They were also surrounded by a thick layer of barbed wire entanglements.

Each fort had 2–4 batteries, equipped with hydraulic rotating steel turrets (100–150 mm). In the summer of 1944, only 10% of the batteries were fully operational. Most of those were in Fort Driant (Feste Kronprinz) and Fort Jeanne d&#x27;Arc (Feste Kaiserin). By November, during the battle of Metz, the German troops had managed to get about 50% of the guns operational in most of the forts listed below. These batteries were lacking range tables, missing sights and other equipment to make the guns fully operational.

Below is a list of the fortifications that exist around the area of Metz. Because they switched hands quite often, the French names are listed as well as any applicable &quot;German&quot; ones. In parentheses is the construction period.

== Forts of the first belt ==
The first, inner belt of fortifications were completed by the French just prior to the Franco-Prussian War and were in service during the Siege of Metz from 3 September to 23 October 1870.
The forts were in a ring approximately 4 km out from the city center, and were (anti-clockwise from the south):

* Fort de Saint-Privat (1870) / &quot;Fort Prinz August von Württemberg&quot; (1872–1875)
* Fort de Queuleu (1867–1870) / &quot;Fort Goeben&quot; (1871–1890)
* Fort des Bordes (1870) / &quot;Fort Zastrow&quot; (1874–1875)
* Fort de Saint-Julien (1867–1870) / &quot;Fort Manteuffel&quot; (1871–1891)
* Fort Gambetta / &quot;Fort Hindersin&quot; (1879–1881)
* Fort Déroulède / &quot;Fort Kameke&quot; (1876–1879)
* Fort Decaen / &quot;Fort Schwerin&quot; (1878–1880)
* Fort de Plappeville (1867–1870) / &quot;Fort Alvensleben&quot; (1871–1891)
* Groupe fortifié du Mont Saint-Quentin (1867–1870) / &quot;Feste Prinz Friedrich-Karl&quot; (1872–1892)
** Fort Diou (1867–1870) / &quot;Ostfort&quot; (1872–1892)
** Fort Girardin / &quot;Fort Manstein&quot; (1872–1892)

== Forts of the second belt ==
The second, outer belt of fortifications were completed by the Germans prior to the First World War but saw little service. Prior to the Second World War they were incorporated by the French into the Maginot Line defenses, but again saw little action. In October 1944, while occupied by the Germans, the fortifications were assaulted and captured by the American 3rd Army in the Battle of Metz.
The forts were in an offset ring from 8–10 km from the city, and were (anticlockwise from the south):

* Fort l’Aisne / &quot;Feste Wagner&quot; (1904–1912)
* Fort l’Yser / &quot;Feste Prinzregent Luitpold&quot; (1907–1914)
* Fort La Marne / &quot;Feste Generalfeldmarschall Freiherr von der Goltz&quot; (1907–1916)

(anticlockwise from the north):
* Fort Lorraine / &quot;Feste Lothringen&quot; (1899–1905)
* Fort François de Guise / &quot;Feste Leipzig&quot; (1907–1912)
* Fort Jeanne d&#x27;Arc / &quot;Feste Kaiserin&quot; (1899–1905) 
* Fort Driant / &quot;Feste Kronprinz&quot; (1899–1905) 
* Fort Verdun / &quot;Feste Haeseler&quot; (1899–1905), sometimes referred to as &quot;Feste Graf Haeseler&quot;

== The &quot;seven dwarfs&quot; ==
These are a series of small defensive emplacements built between 1912 and 1916 in a line between Driant and Jeanne d&#x27;Arc. The name for them was created by the Americans of the U.S. Third Army during the Battle of Metz in the Second World War. They are sometimes (mistakenly) referred to as forts, and their name alludes to their weak defensive strength. From south to north they are:
* Marival bunker
* Vaux Southern point of support
* Vaux Northern point of support
* &quot;Bois-la-Dame&quot; (&#x27;Lady&#x27;s Wood&#x27;) bunker
* Jussy Southern point of support
* Jussy Northern point of support
* Saint Hubert point of support

<text>A public editor is a position existing at some news publications; the person holding this position is responsible for supervising the implementation of proper journalism ethics within that publication. These responsibilities include identifying and examining critical errors or omissions, and acting as a liaison with the public. Most commonly, public editors perform this work through a regular feature on a newspaper&#x27;s editorial page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they&#x27;re criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.

Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their ombudsman, though this is not always the case. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen.

The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo&#x27;s &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; and the &quot;Louisville Times&quot; in 1967.

At &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the position was created in response to the Jayson Blair scandal. The &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; first public editor was Daniel Okrent, whose background was primarily in book publishing; Okrent held the position from December 2003 through May 2005. Over the next twelve years, five persons in succession held the position, but then on May 31, 2017, the &quot;Times&quot; announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.

<doc id="1168437" wikidata="Q1565547" url="?curid=1168437" title="HMS Tiger (1913)">
<text>HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; was a battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy during the 1910s. The ship was the most heavily armoured British battlecruiser at the start of the First World War in 1914, but was not yet ready for service. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, though she was still shaking down and did not perform well. &quot;Tiger&quot; next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, where she was only lightly damaged despite suffering many hits by German shells. Apart from providing distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, she spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea.

The ship was the oldest battlecruiser retained by the Royal Navy after the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty came into effect in 1922. She became a gunnery training ship in 1924 and then joined the Battlecruiser Squadron in 1929 when its flagship, , underwent a lengthy refit. Upon &quot;Hood&quot;″s return to service in 1931, &quot;Tiger&quot; was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1932 in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

In his book, &quot;The Price of Admiralty&quot;, British military historian John Keegan described her as &quot;certainly the most beautiful warship in the world then, and perhaps ever[.]&quot;

==Design and description==
&quot;Tiger&quot; was the sole battlecruiser authorised in the 1911–12 Naval Programme. According to naval historian Siegfried Breyer, a sister ship named &quot;Leopard&quot; was considered in the 1912–13 Programme and deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the , but there is no record of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.

&quot;Tiger&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of at deep load. She normally displaced and at deep load. Although &quot;Tiger&quot; was only longer and wider than the previous battlecruiser, , she displaced almost more than the older ship. She had a metacentric height of at deep load. In September 1914, her complement consisted of 1,112 officers and ratings; in April 1918, they totalled 1,459.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Tiger&quot; had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft. Her three-bladed propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by 39 Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers in five boiler rooms at a working pressure of . The turbines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum of when forced, but only achieved during her sea trials, although she managed to exceed her maximum designed speed of by over a knot.

The ship&#x27;s fuel stowage capacity was of fuel oil and of coal, giving a total fuel supply of —much more than &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s total of . The sole (unofficial) figure for &quot;Tiger&quot;″s daily fuel consumption of a day at would have given a maximum endurance of . The equivalent figure for &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was roughly . Four direct current electric dynamos with a total capacity of supplied the common ring main at 220 volts.

===Armament===

&quot;Tiger&quot; mounted eight 45-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +20°, although the directors controlling the turrets were limited to 15° 21&#x27; until superelevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 20° elevation, this provided a maximum range of . The rate of fire of these guns was approximately 2 rounds per minute. The ship carried a total of 1040 rounds during wartime for 130 shells per gun.

Her secondary armament consisted of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns in casemates. The guns could depress to −7° and had a maximum elevation of 14°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of approximately ; this gave a maximum range of at +14° elevation. They were provided with 120 rounds per gun. The ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt Mk I anti-aircraft guns on high-angle Mark II mounts. The gun had a maximum elevation of +90° and fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a maximum effective ceiling of . Originally, &quot;Tiger&quot; carried 300 rounds per gun, but this was reduced during the war to 150 rounds per gun.

Four  submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the beam, one pair port and starboard forward of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette and aft of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette. The ship carried 20 Mark II*** torpedoes, each with a warhead of of TNT. They had two speed settings which governed their range; at , they could reach , or at .

===Fire control===
The main guns of &quot;Tiger&quot; were controlled from either of the two fire-control directors. The primary director was in the fore-top on the foremast and the other was mounted on the aft superstructure in the torpedo control tower. Data from rangefinders in the armoured hood above the conning tower and in &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets was transmitted to the Mk IV Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the transmitting station below the waterline. The observations were then plotted and converted into range and deflection data for use by the director and guns. A Mark VII* Dumaresq in the armoured tower was trained on the target to supply bearing data to one transmitting station for use in plotting and calculations, and a second station was fitted for the ship&#x27;s secondary armament, although a pair of fire-control directors for those guns, one for each broadside, were not fitted until 1915.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding the First World War and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously by an electrical trigger which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.

During the war, &quot;Tiger&quot;″s rangefinders had increased in number and in size. By the end of the war, &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets mounted rangefinders while &#x27;X&#x27; turret, the armoured hood above the conning tower (also known as the gun control tower), and the torpedo control tower had instruments. A rangefinder was fitted in the fore-top and three instruments were fitted on &#x27;B&#x27; turret, the gun control tower and above the compass platform. A high-angle rangefinder was mounted above the roof of the fore-top for use by the anti-aircraft guns.

===Armour===

&quot;Tiger&quot;″s armour protection was similar to that of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships. It thinned to four inches towards the ship&#x27;s ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The depth of the main belt below the waterline was reduced from , although a strake of three-inch armour tall was added below the main belt that stretched from the front of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette to the rear of &#x27;B&#x27; barbette. It was based on that used on the Vickers built Japanese battlecruiser , the only design influence on &quot;Tiger&quot; that can be attributed to that ship.

Like the ships and &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot; was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. Unlike those ships, &quot;Tiger&quot; had an additional strake of 6-inch armour above the upper belt protecting her secondary armament. Four-inch transverse bulkheads closed off the ends of the armoured citadel. High-tensile steel was used for the protective decks. They generally ranged from in thickness.

The gun turrets had 9-inch front and sides while their roofs were thick. The barbettes were protected above the citadel by of armour, thinning to three to four inches inside the citadel. The main conning tower had a three-inch roof and sides thick. The walls of the communication tube were three to four inches thick. The aft conning tower had 6-inch walls and a 3-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. After the Battle of Jutland revealed the ship&#x27;s vulnerability to plunging shellfire, around of additional armour was added to the turret roofs, the decks over the magazines, and the bulkheads separating the 6-inch guns.

==Service history==
===First World War===
&quot;Tiger&quot; was laid down at the John Brown and Company shipyard in Clydebank on 6 June 1912. She was launched on 15 December 1913 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 3 October 1914, at the cost of £2,593,100, including armament. The ship was still under construction when the First World War broke out in August 1914. On 3 August 1914, Captain Henry Pelly was appointed to command the incomplete ship. Beatty described Pelly at the time as &quot;a very charming person and, what is more important just now, a very efficient officer&quot;.

&quot;Tiger&quot; was commissioned for the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) on 3 October. After the Battle of Coronel and the deployment of three battlecruisers to hunt for the German East Asia Squadron, &quot;Tiger&quot; was ordered to cut short her firing trials off Berehaven. Beatty described &quot;Tiger&quot; to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher of Kilverstone, as &quot;not yet fit to fight. Three out of her four dynamoes are out of action for an indefinite period, and her training is impeded by bad weather, which might continue for many weeks at this time of year, and at present is quite unprepared and inefficient.&quot;

====Battle of Dogger Bank====

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. However, the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th, when the British light cruiser spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35, the Germans had spotted Beatty&#x27;s force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing this would suffice if the ships he saw to his north-west were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to &#x27;s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, , and &quot;Tiger&quot;, were doing in pursuit and &quot;Lion&quot; opened fire at 08:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on &quot;Blücher&quot; until 09:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 09:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on &quot;Lion&quot;. At 09:35, Beatty signalled &quot;Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy&#x27;s line&quot;, but Captain Pelly, believing that was already engaging &quot;Blücher&quot;, fired at , as did &quot;Lion&quot;, which left free to continue attacking &quot;Lion&quot; without risk.
In the meantime, &quot;Blücher&quot; had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to and her steering gear had been jammed. Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot; to attack her at 10:48. Six minutes later, Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although he failed to hoist the &quot;Submarine Warning&quot; flag because most of &quot;Lion&quot;″s signal halyards had been shot away. Shortly afterward, &quot;Lion&quot; lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered &quot;Course north-east&quot; at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted &quot;Attack the rear of the enemy&quot; on the other halyard, although there was no connection between the two signals. Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, temporarily commanding in , thought that the signals meant for him to attack &quot;Blücher&quot;, which was about to the north-east, which he did, turning away from Hipper&#x27;s main body. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.

He transferred his flag to the destroyer at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before &quot;Blücher&quot; sank and boarded &quot;Princess Royal&quot; at 12:20. He ordered the pursuit of the German battlecruisers to be resumed, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking &quot;Blücher&quot; and Hipper&#x27;s ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. &quot;Lion&quot; was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12:45.

During the action, &quot;Tiger&quot; was hit by six German shells, the most significant of which was a shell that burst on the roof of &#x27;Q&#x27; turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun&#x27;s breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. &quot;Tiger&quot;″s repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, &quot;Tiger&quot;″s own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 shells fired, scoring one hit each on &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and . Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly&#x27;s performance, calling him a &quot;&quot; and adding &quot;The &quot;Tiger&quot;″s gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to have had a lot of practice.&quot; In a memorandum of 11 February 1915, Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through &quot;Tiger&quot;″s part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: &quot;In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success.&quot; The ship was given a refit in December 1915.

====Battle of Jutland====
On 31 May 1916, &quot;Tiger&quot; and the 1st BCS had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, under Beatty&#x27;s overall command, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not see the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, positioning the British ships to cut off the German&#x27;s line of retreat, and signalled action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.
This was later characterised as the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course less than away. The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The 1st BCS was echeloned to the right with &quot;Tiger&quot; in the rear and the furthest to the west, closest to the Germans. &quot;Tiger&quot; missed Beatty&#x27;s fire distribution order, as had &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and &quot;Tiger&quot; engaged &quot;Moltke&quot;, instead of &quot;Seydlitz&quot; as Beatty intended. The German fire was accurate from the start, with &quot;Tiger&quot; hit six times by &quot;Moltke&quot; within the first seven minutes; although two of these hits temporarily disabled both &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets, she was not seriously damaged. By 15:54, the range was down to ; Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57.
Around 16:00, was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from . She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking toward the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 16:03 after more hits destroying the ship with the loss of all hands but three.
The range gradually increased until the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 16:12 and 16:15 to close the range. By 16:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded. &quot;Tiger&quot;, following in &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s wake at a distance of only , had to put her helm hard-a-starboard to avoid colliding with the wreckage. At 16:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north. By this time, &quot;Tiger&quot; had been hit a total of 17 times, all but one fired by &quot;Moltke&quot;, but she remained fit to fight.

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit, but Beatty&#x27;s ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet, and at 17:40 opened fire again on their German counterparts. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 17:47. Beatty gradually turned toward the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division further from the Germans. By 18:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 18:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper&#x27;s force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of &quot;New Zealand&quot;, while slowing to and altering course to the south to stay close to the Grand Fleet. At this moment, &quot;Lion&quot;″s gyrocompass failed, and she—followed by the rest of the battlecruisers—made a complete circle before her steering was brought back under control. At 18:55, Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 19:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the trap his manoeuvring caused.
The British lost sight of the Germans until spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 20:05, then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. On hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers. Shortly after 8:30, the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans fired only a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 20:40. Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 02:55.

&quot;Tiger&quot; and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on the morning of 2 June. Docked the next day for repairs which took until 1 July, she was the first of the &quot;Splendid Cats&quot; to be repaired. &quot;Tiger&quot; was hit a total of 18 times during the battle, mostly by shells fired by &quot;Moltke&quot;, suffering 24 men killed and 46 wounded. The battlecruiser fired 303 shells from her main guns during the battle and is credited with one hit on &quot;Moltke&quot; and two on &quot;Von der Tann&quot;. The ship also fired 136 rounds from her 6-inch guns at the light cruiser and German destroyers.
====Post-Jutland service====

After her repairs were completed, &quot;Tiger&quot; served as the temporary flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while &quot;Lion&quot; was under repair. In the meantime, on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers, including &quot;Tiger&quot;. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake, the Germans then steered for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet, but he was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home; the British had lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and a German dreadnought had been damaged by a torpedo.

The ship received a lengthy refit from 10 November 1916 to 29 January 1917 at Rosyth where her deck and turret roof armour were reinforced and additional rangefinders were added over her conning tower and the rear of &#x27;X&#x27; turret. For the remainder of the war, &quot;Tiger&quot; uneventfully patrolled the North Sea, as both fleets were essentially forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. The same year saw her undergo a minor refit during which a flying-off platform for a Sopwith Camel was mounted on &#x27;Q&#x27; turret and a searchlight platform was added to her third funnel. She underwent a more extensive refit in 1918 which saw her topmast shifted to the top of the derrick-stump and a more substantial observation platform added to the foremast. Some of her short rangefinders were replaced by longer ones as well.

===Post-war===
&quot;Tiger&quot; remained in service with the Royal Navy after the Armistice with Germany and she had a flying-off platform added on &#x27;B&#x27; turret&#x27;s roof in 1919. The ship collided with the battleship in late 1920 while assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Tiger&quot; survived the culling of older capital ships following the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was placed in on 22 August 1921. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a rangefinder fitted on &#x27;X&#x27; turret, her original pair of 3-inch AA guns replaced by four guns, and the flying-off platform on &#x27;Q&#x27; turret was removed. On 14 February 1924, &quot;Tiger&quot; was recommissioned and became a seagoing training ship, a role she served in throughout the 1920s. Her last major period of activity came in 1929, when went into dockyard hands for refit. While &quot;Hood&quot; was out of commission, &quot;Tiger&quot; returned to active service to keep the Royal Navy&#x27;s three-ship Battlecruiser Squadron (normally made up of &quot;Hood&quot; plus the smaller and ) up to strength. Although by the 1930s, &quot;Tiger&quot; was still in reasonable condition, the decision was taken to discard her following the London Naval Conference 1930 as part of an overall reduction in world battleship fleets. Under the command of Captain Kenneth Dewar in 1928 to 1929, her final commander was Arthur Bedford, and she remained in service with the fleet until &quot;Hood&quot; came out of refit in early 1931, at which time she was taken out of commission in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.

&quot;Tiger&quot; took the cheers of the Atlantic Fleet on 30 March 1931 at Devonport. She paid off on 15 May 1931 at Rosyth, before being sold to Thos. W. Ward of Inverkeithing for breaking up in February 1932.

<text>Harry Lampert (November 3, 1916 – November 13, 2004) was an American cartoonist and bridge teacher and writer.

== Biography ==
Born in New York City, Lampert began cartooning when he was sixteen years old, and worked for the legendary Max Fleischer, inking and helping produce &quot;Betty Boop&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot;, and &quot;Koko the Clown&quot; cartoons. While stationed at Drew Field in Tampa, FL, he created &quot;Droopy the Drew Field Mosquito&quot; which ran in the &quot;Drew Field Echoes&quot; from 1942-1944. He began drawing comic books and he is best known in that field for being the artistic co-creator of the DC Comics superhero The Flash. Created in collaboration with writer Gardner Fox, the hero first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 in 1940, but Lampert left &quot;The Flash&quot; after drawing only two stories, gravitating towards his preference for humorous work. (After he discovered his fame in the comics world 50 years later, Lampert observed that he did not own any &quot; &#x27;original&#x27; originals&quot;, not even a Flash comic book. &quot;It was too expensive.&quot;) He also drew the comic book characters &quot;The King&quot;, &quot;Red, White and Blue&quot; and &quot;The Atom&quot;. Lampert later went on to draw gag cartoons for &quot;TIME&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. He was also an instructor for the New York City School of Visual Arts and founded the Lampert Agency, an advertising company which produced award-winning ads for clients such as Olympic Airways, Seagram, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

After his retirement in 1976, Lampert went on to write many instructional books on contract bridge. A Life Master and bridge teacher licensed by the American Contract Bridge League, Lampert spent years giving classes and working the cruise ship circuit teaching bridge to players. In the mid-1990s, Lampert became active in the comic book convention circuit, selling new sketches and autographs and speaking about his famous comic book creation.

Lampert died on November 13, 2004, in Boca Raton, Florida, of a cerebral hemorrhage; he was survived by wife Adele Lampert, daughter Karen Akavan and two grandsons.

<doc id="1168445" wikidata="Q3477828" url="?curid=1168445" title="Canyon, California">
<text>Canyon, formerly known as Sequoya, is an unincorporated community located near the border of Contra Costa and Alameda counties, in the U.S. state of California. It is situated between Oakland and Moraga in the San Francisco Bay Area. The community is named for its location in the upper canyon of San Leandro Creek along the eastern slope of the Berkeley Hills. Canyon lies at an elevation of 1138 feet (347 m).

The community is mainly traversed by Pinehurst Road and Canyon Road. The homes of the community are nestled amongst the steep, narrow private roads and footpaths that extend from the redwood groves and ferns along the creek, through the mixed live oak, bay, and madrone forests on the steep hillsides, up to the chaparral and knobcone pines that grow along the ridge.

==History==
Canyon has a colorful history. Logging camps and notorious saloons helped establish a local reputation for rowdiness in the nineteenth century. A vast forest known as the Moraga Redwoods once covered the valley that is now Canyon. An extant fire trail west of the spot where Pinehurst Road makes a sharp hairpin turn near Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve was previously known as Winding Way on some maps, and was originally an old 19th century logging road built by Hiram Thorn. In the 1850s, Thorn operated a mill on the site. Thorn built the road to bring redwood logs out of the forest and to his mill, and then over the mountain into Oakland via the Temescal Creek route on the northwest edge of Montclair Village. The Oakland part of the route is now known as Thornhill Road.

In the first half of the 20th century, the local water company, East Bay Municipal Utilities District, purchased much land south of town. They constructed the Upper San Leandro Reservoir, which, as it filled up, slowly flooded the former towns of Valle Vista and Redwood. The reservoir also flooded several neighborhoods of Canyon itself. In fact, the only reason Canyon is not the size of neighboring Moraga is because of a lack of a viable water resource. The few people that do live there are mostly commuters and retired people who like the town&#x27;s seclusion and its proximity to San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.

Earlier in the 20th century, the Sacramento Northern Railway ran through the canyon for which the community is named. The rails ran on a bench (still present) above Pinehurst Road, upon exiting a long tunnel from Oakland at the site of Thorn&#x27;s road. The eastern portal (called Eastport by the railroad) just north of Canyon was buried by a landslide in 1980 and is no longer visible, but was located on the inside of the hairpin turn on Pinehurst Road.

In the late 1960s, Canyon became a center of political and social protest and creative alternative lifestyles. Canyon Cinema of San Francisco was founded by neighbors here in the 1960s. In the summer of 1967 Country Joe and the Fish with the Youngbloods played a benefit for the Canyon School.

Today&#x27;s residents still work together to maintain their own roads and water systems, and Canyon Community Association volunteers provide mediation services, emergency planning, and interface with county and state agencies. Much of the land beyond the community is owned by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD).

==Infrastructure==
The only public services in the community are the local post office (ZIP Code 94516) where all mail is picked up and the Canyon School, a 68-student K-8 public school, located on Pinehurst Road on the banks of the Upper San Leandro Creek. A notion of the community&#x27;s unconventionality may be gleaned from the fact that the school lunch menu features organic milk and produce, Niman Ranch beef, and hormone and antibiotic free chicken. The community is in area code 925.

As John van der Zee wrote in his book about the town, &quot;Canyon&quot; (1972): 
Between 2011 and 2013, a Carmelite monastery was located on a ranch in the western area of the town. The nuns moved in 2014 to a building in the nearby town of Kensington, California.

==Climate==
Canyon enjoys a cool summer Mediterranean climate (Koppen classification &quot;csb&quot;) similar to that of the nearby city of Oakland, California, though slightly warmer. Fog maintains the cool summer weather.

==Timeline==
* 1850s: First settlers
* 1918: First Canyon School is built
* 1922: Canyon Post Office is built

<doc id="1168449" wikidata="Q1761185" url="?curid=1168449" title="Pimm's">
<text>Pimm&#x27;s is an English brand of gin-based fruit cup but may also be considered a liqueur or the basis of a sling or punch. It was first produced in 1823 by James Pimm and has been owned by Diageo since 1997. Its most popular product is Pimm&#x27;s No. 1 Cup, commonly used for the Pimm&#x27;s cup cocktail.

==Serving==

Pimm&#x27;s is dark brown with a reddish tint, and a subtle taste of spice and citrus fruit. As a summer long drink, it is normally served as a Pimm&#x27;s cup cocktail, a drink with &quot;English-style&quot; (clear and carbonated) lemonade, as well as various chopped garnishes, particularly apple, cucumber, orange, lemon, strawberry and mint or borage, though mint is more common. Ginger ale is used as a common substitute for lemonade.

Pimm&#x27;s can also be mixed with champagne (or other sparkling white wines), resulting in a drink known as a &quot;Pimm&#x27;s Royal Cup&quot;. Pimm&#x27;s Winter Cup is generally mixed with warm apple juice. A &quot;Glasgow Garden Party&quot; is a drink made with Pimm&#x27;s substituting lemonade with Irn Bru excluding any fruit garnish. A &quot;Pimmlet&quot; is a gimlet with Pimm&#x27;s No.1 substituted for gin. A Pimm&#x27;s mojito substitutes lemon and lime soda with muddled limes and soda water.

==History==
Pimm, a farmer&#x27;s son from Kent, became the owner of an oyster bar in the City of London, near the Bank of England. He offered the tonic (a gin-based drink containing a secret mixture of herbs and liqueurs) as an aid to digestion, serving it in a small tankard known as a &quot;No. 1 Cup&quot;, hence its subsequent name.

In 1851, Pimm&#x27;s No. 2 Cup and Pimm&#x27;s No. 3 Cup were introduced. Pimm&#x27;s began large-scale production in 1851 to keep up with sales to other bars. The distillery began selling it in 1859. In 1865, Pimm sold the business and the right to use his name to Frederick Sawyer. In 1880, the business was acquired by future Lord Mayor of London Horatio Davies, and a chain of Pimm&#x27;s Oyster Houses was franchised in 1887.

Over the years, Pimm&#x27;s extended their range, using other spirits as bases for new &quot;cups&quot;. After World War II, Pimm&#x27;s No. 4 Cup was invented, followed by Pimm&#x27;s No. 5 Cup and Pimm&#x27;s No. 6 Cup in the 1960s.

The brand fell on hard times in the 1970s and 1980s. The Oyster House chain was sold, and Pimm&#x27;s Cup products Nos. 2 to 5 were phased out due to reduced demand in 1970, after new owners, The Distillers Company, took control of the brand. In 1986, The Distillers Company was purchased by Guinness PLC, and Pimm&#x27;s became part of Diageo when Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged in 1997. In 2004, Pimm&#x27;s introduced Pimm&#x27;s Winter Cup, which consists of Pimm&#x27;s No. 3 Cup (the brandy-based variant) infused with spices and orange peel.

The discontinued No. 6 Vodka Cup variety was reinstated in 2015 following a successful campaign led by a group of enthusiastic Vodka Cup Pimm&#x27;s drinkers. Despite a promise from the parent company and Pimm&#x27;s owner Diageo to keep No. 6 in production, it is no longer possible to buy Vodka Cup Pimm&#x27;s.

==Popularity and distribution==

Pimm&#x27;s is most popular in England, particularly southern England. It is one of the two staple drinks at the Wimbledon tennis tournament, the Chelsea Flower Show, the Henley Royal Regatta and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera the other being champagne. The first Pimm&#x27;s Bar opened at the Wimbledon tournament in 1971; every year, over 80,000 pints of Pimm&#x27;s cocktail are sold to spectators. Along with champagne, it has been declared one of two official drinks of Wimbledon, and it has also gained popularity among British universities. A Pimm&#x27;s is also a standard cocktail at British and American polo matches.

The brand experienced a revival in the early 2000s following a 2003 advertising campaign, which featured a humorous classic upper-class &quot;Hooray Henry&quot; character called Harry Fitzgibbon-Sims (portrayed by Alexander Armstrong) with the catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s Pimm&#x27;s o&#x27;clock!&quot;, somewhat mocking their own traditional advertising and appeal. Diageo&#x27;s 2010 campaign featured a more diverse range of characters representing different elements of the Pimm&#x27;s cocktail (Pimm&#x27;s No.1 being an Englishman in red and white blazer, lemonade being three young women in yellow, ice represented by a mature man), coming together to the theme tune of 1970s British television show &quot;The New Avengers&quot;.

==Products==

Seven Pimm&#x27;s products have been produced throughout the brand&#x27;s history, all fruit cups differing only in their alcoholic base. Only Nos. 1 and a &#x27;Winter Cup&#x27; based on No. 3 remain in production. It was originally in imperial oz. [757-ml] bottles, then made in standard metric 26.4 imperial oz. [750-ml] bottles when it started being sold overseas in Europe, and now is in 700 ml and 1 litre bottles. The beverages were originally a standard 31.53% ABV, then curbed to 28.90% ABV in the 1960s, and are now only 25% ABV.

* Pimm&#x27;s No. 1 Cup [1840–present] is the most popular Pimm&#x27;s cup. Based on gin, its base as bottled is 25 per cent alcohol by volume. 
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 2 Cup [1930s–1970] was based on Scotch whisky, and was phased out by new brand owners The Distillers Company in 1970.
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 3 Cup [1930s–1970; 2004–present] is based on brandy; it was phased out in 1970, and relaunched in 2004, now infused with spices and orange peel and called &quot;Pimm&#x27;s Winter Cup&quot;.
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 4 Cup [1935–1970] was based on dark rum.
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 5 Cup [1930s?–1970] was based on rye whisky. It was originally designed as an alternative to Pimm&#x27;s No. 2 for the Canadian market. Its popularity there during the postwar period encouraged Pimm&#x27;s to sell it in the British market and overseas to Europe and America as well.
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 6 Cup [1964–1970; 2004–2021] was based on vodka. It was reintroduced in 2004 as &quot;Pimm&#x27;s Vodka Cup&quot;, temporarily discontinued in 2014, but brought back in 2015 after an outcry from Pimm&#x27;s customers, only to be discontinued again in 2021.
* Pimm&#x27;s No. 7 Cup [late 1960s? – 1970], based on tequila. It was designed for the American market, as tequila was not very popular in Britain and Europe at the time. It was made in such small numbers before it was discontinued that it is one of the rarest variants. Websites including Difford&#x27;s Guide say the liqueur was introduced sometime after World War II, while other sources claim No. 7 was never a real commercial product.

The Pimm&#x27;s No. 2 and No. 5 Cups were introduced as a mixer for whisky cocktails. The Pimm&#x27;s No. 3 and No. 4 Cups were introduced as heated cold-weather or winter versions of the summertime Pimm&#x27;s No. 1.

The Pimm&#x27;s Winter Cup and Pimm&#x27;s Vodka Cup were reintroduced in 2004. &quot;Pimm&#x27;s Winter Cup&quot; is a seasonally available version of Pimm&#x27;s No.3 infused with spices and orange peel. &quot;Pimm&#x27;s Vodka Cup&quot; is a reintroduction of Pimm&#x27;s No.6, but is made in limited quantities.

Pimm&#x27;s &quot;Original No.1 Cup&quot; (frequently mixed with lemonade) (or &quot;Pimm&#x27;s &amp; Lemonade&quot;) is a pre-mixed fortified lemonade with a Pimm&#x27;s No. 1 base with a strength of 5.4% ABV. It is available in 12-packs of 250 ml cans or 1 litre bottles. Pimm&#x27;s Lemonade &amp; Ginger Ale is a pre-mixed fortified lemonade with a Pimm&#x27;s No. 1 base and flavoured with ginger-ale that has a strength of 4% ABV. It is available in 4-packs (or cases of six 4-packs) of 330 ml bottles.

There are also special edition versions that are 20% ABV and come in standard European 700 ml bottles. Pimm&#x27;s Blackberry and Elderflower [made from 2013] is based on Pimms No. 6 with blackberry and elderflower flavouring. Pimm&#x27;s Strawberry (with a hint of mint) [made from 2015] is based on Pimm&#x27;s No. 1 with additional strawberry and mint flavouring.

Some retailers have marketed &quot;Pimm&#x27;s style&quot; drinks under other names. In the UK, these have included Aldi&#x27;s &quot;Austin&#x27;s&quot;, Lidl&#x27;s &quot;Jeeves&quot;, and Sainsbury&#x27;s &quot;Pitchers&quot;.

<text>Kuitpo Forest ( ) is a plantation forest in South Australia located about south-east of the Adelaide city centre.

Kuipto, the first of many forest plantations in the Mount Lofty Ranges, was established in 1898 to ensure a sustainable timber supply for South Australia. The forest of radiata pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;}, serves as both a community forest and a commercial venture. Kuitpo is one of the more popular plantation forests; it is regularly frequented by locals and tourists alike, as an escape to nature. It is equipped with many walking trails, and a ForestrySA interpretive centre provides insight into both the forest ecology and the history of Kuitpo. The Heysen Trail runs through the forest, popular for any South Australian hiker, as well as being popular for bike rides, camping, picnics and also a great place to go horse riding or foraging for mushrooms.

The Kuitpo Forest Reserve covers an area of about , the majority of which is softwood plantation. Attempts at growing native timbers were largely abandoned as they proved too slow-growing. Instead, the tree of choice became radiata pine, a California native, although many other timbers are still grown. Native forest is found in small areas with the designated forest but also in nearby conservation parks, such as Mount Magnificent Conservation Park and Kyeema Conservation Park. Most of the remaining surrounding area is farm land, mainly for cattle.

Travel to the area from Adelaide is relatively fast and easy. A tourist route begins at a turnoff from South Road at O&#x27;Halloran Hill, onto Chandlers Hill Road. From here signs direct the visitor through Clarendon to Meadows. The area is also approachable from the south through Willunga.

==Climate==
Kuitpo Forest has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;).

<doc id="1168454" wikidata="Q1389283" url="?curid=1168454" title="Jon Conway">
<text>Jonathan David Conway (born May 6, 1977) is an American retired soccer goalkeeper and former goalkeeping coach for Toronto FC.

==Youth and college==
Born in Media, Pennsylvania, as a youth, Conway played club soccer for the Lower Merion Gorillas, leading them to the Under 13 Indoor and Outdoor state championships in 1990 - this was the first Lower Merion club to capture both state titles in the same year. They are arguably the greatest team in LMSC history (ask Biff Sturla). He later played for powerhouse youth soccer club F.C. Delco, and played four years of college soccer at Rutgers University. Conway was an all-state soccer player from Sun Valley High School in Aston, Pennsylvania.

==Professional career==
Conway was drafted with the 28th pick of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft by San Jose Earthquakes. Conway spent his first years as a professional as the backup to Joe Cannon, but was given his chance at the starting position when Cannon left the Quakes in 2003 for France.

In 2000, he went on loan with Bay Area Seals, playing four games with a 0.50 goals against average. Conway suffered a broken right ankle in preseason and the Quakes were forced to find a replacement; that replacement came in the form of Canadian international goalkeeper Pat Onstad from Rochester Raging Rhinos of the A-League, who went on to be named Goalkeeper of the year in MLS. Conway remained a capable backup keeper for the Quakes, playing in the occasional US Open Cup games and when Onstad was injured or away on international duty. Conway has won 2 MLS Cup Championships.

After the 2005 season, Conway was traded to the MetroStars in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick. In 2006, Conway finished best among all goalkeepers in MLS with a 1.00 GAA (goals against average) and compiled a record of 7 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties with 5 shutouts. In 2007, Conway compiled a record of 6 wins, 5 losses and 2 ties with 4 shutouts and a 1.10 GAA. He entered the 2008 season as the starting goalkeeper for the since renamed New York Red Bulls. On June 29, 2009, Conway was released by New York to free a spot for Senegalese goal keeper Bouna Coundoul.

In September 2009, Conway&#x27;s MLS rights, which under MLS roster rules were still held by Red Bulls even after his release, were traded to Chivas USA for a fourth-round pick in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft.

After the waiving of back-up keeper Brian Edwards, Toronto FC acquired the 32-year-old goalkeeper to replace Edwards. Conway made his debut for Toronto in the Canadian Championship against the Vancouver Whitecaps May 19, 2010. He continued to make non-league appearances for Toronto throughout the 2010 season within the Canadian Championship and the CONCACAF Champions League. Conway had a stand out performance versus Real Salt Lake in the Champions League in a 1–1 home draw on September 28, 2010, setting up teammate Jacob Peterson with a long throw to start the break. He made his first league appearance for Toronto on October 16, 2010, in a 2–2 home draw versus Columbus Crew in which he received a red card in the 72nd minute.

Toronto traded Conway to Chicago Fire on January 13, 2011, in exchange for the No. 49 pick in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft. At season&#x27;s end, Chicago declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Conway was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in stage 2 of the draft. However, he instead opted to retire.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, he became the goalkeeper coach with the Toronto FC Academy in 2012. In 2014, he joined the Toronto FC first team as goalkeeper coach.

==Personal==
He is married to sports broadcaster Andi Petrillo.

<text>Master Chief Petty Officer Krishnan Madhavan Nair (25 July 1939 – 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, born as the son of Madhavan Pillai and Bharathiyamma in Kollam, was an Indian actor, naval officer, and stunt performer of the 1970s and 1980s. He starred in over 150 Malayalam films, primarily as an action star. In 2010 he was referred to as the first and most successful action hero of Malayalam cinema.

His superstar image became a cartoon, email, and SMS phenomenon in the early 2000s, portraying him as a comic superhero with unique quotes of superhuman strength attributed to the action star becoming widespread. These movements were fuelled by a renewed fascination with his style of dialogue delivery and his machismo image. These were claimed to honour his memories, but were also criticised for parodying the actor years after his death.

==Early life==
Jayan was born in Quilon, Travancore (present day Kollam, Kerala, India) as the first child of his father Thevalli Kottaram Veetil Madhavan Pillai and mother Bharathiyamma. His birth name was Krishnan Nair. He had a younger brother named Soman Nair. Malayalam actress Jayabharathi, who was his first cousin introduced him to the film industry.

Jayan&#x27;s formal education ended at the 10th grade at Kollam Government Boys High School when he joined the Indian Navy. He was a member of the Indian Navy team to travelled to Great Britain in 1961 for taking India&#x27;s first war ship INS Vikrant. He played for Navy football team. His first accolades for his acting skills reached him when he was a naval sailor.

Jayan served in the Indian Navy for 16 years, culminating in the rank of Master CPO. By the end of his navy days, he had begun efforts to start small businesses at Ernakulam and became a regular inhabitant of the Cochin Tourist Home. During his life at Ernakulam, he would meet some of his lifelong friends. It was such a chance meeting while on leave, with Rajan Prakash who is the veteran Malayalam actor Jose Prakash&#x27;s son, who owned a dry cleaning shop in Cochin, that eventually landed him a role in the movie &quot;Shapa Moksham&quot;. A year later, he left the Indian Navy and started trying his hand at various civilian jobs, working for companies in Cochin for a few years till his acting career began to succeed.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Jayan made a few uncredited appearances in some films during the early 1970s. According to his nephew, he had the role of a vampire-like character in an unnamed project costarred by Vidhubala, which was never released. His first appearance with the name Jayan was in the movie &quot;Shapamoksham&quot;, which is usually credited as his first film.

=== Rise to fame ===
The name &quot;Jayan&quot; ( &quot;The Victor&quot;) was given to him by veteran Malayalam actor Jose Prakash on the sets of &quot;Shapamoksham&quot;. Jayan got his first major break appearing as a villain in &quot;Panchami&quot; (1976), playing a forest ranger. Jayan&#x27;s performance in this film was appreciated in the industry and his physical appearance was also noticed for the first time. His next notable role was in &quot;Thacholi Ambu&quot; (1978), in which he appeared in a supporting role. In the same year, he acted as a sage in the Sreekumaran Thampi film &quot;Etho Oru Swapnam,&quot; which was well received by critics. He also appeared in the 1978 horror film &quot;Lisa,&quot; in a supporting role&quot;.&quot; But what made Jayan a superstar was his antihero role in &quot;Sarapancharam&quot; (1979, &quot;Bed of Arrows&quot;). He catapulted to fame riding on machismo roles that endeared him to the masses, and he established himself as one of the most popular Malayalam film actors of his time with superhit movies like &quot;Chaakara&quot; (1980), &quot;Love in Singapore&quot; (1980)&quot;, Paalattu Kunjikkannan&quot; (1980)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Naayattu&quot; (1980), &quot;Manushya Mrugam&quot; (1980) and &quot;Angadi&quot; (1980) the latter of which was the highest grossing film of the year. He is generally regarded as the first action hero in Malayalam cinema.

=== Superstardom ===
&quot;Sarapancharam&quot; broke all box-office records set in the Malayalam movie industry till it&#x27;s time and became the highest-grossing movie of 1979. Its box-office records were broken by another Jayan film, &quot;Angadi&quot; in the following year, which cemented his popularity among the masses. In films such as &quot;Aavesham&quot; and &quot;Manushya Mrugam&quot; he played double roles. During his career, he received only a few critically appreciated roles perhaps partly due to his commercial hero image and partly due to the lack of films that garnered critical appreciation at the time. The focus was always on his unmatched drawing power as an action star and by 1980, at the peak of his career, he had attained a genuine superhero image. Movies exploited Jayan&#x27;s masculine physique and he appeared bare-chested in numerous scenes. His on-screen attire (most famously his Elvis bellbottoms), his masculine image and later the nature of his death transformed him into a legendary pop culture icon in Kerala. Jayan was also known for his unique method of dialogue delivery and he has contributed many memorable lines to the Malayalam film history.

=== Multistar films ===
Jayan acted in several ensemble cast movies, mostly with Prem Nazir. The duo acted in films such as &quot;Naayattu, Love in Singapore, Chandrahasam, Thacholi Ambu, Kannappanunni, Paalattu Kunjikkannan, Maamaankam, Prabhu&quot; etc. all of which were top-grossing movies at the box office. He also acted with other popular actors of the time, such as Soman, Sukumaran and Madhu in many films. In early films before 1979 (e.g. &quot;Thacholi Ambu&quot; and &quot;Panchami&quot;), he had negative or supporting roles. But later films in the beginning of 1980 relied heavily on Jayan&#x27;s drawing power as an action hero and placed him as the central character. In 1980, the duo Jayan and Prem Nazir were cast in &quot;Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam&quot; by P. Venu, that showcased the most famous fight scene in Malayalam cinema. Prem Nazir agreed to play a supporting role in &quot;Naayattu&quot;, which was very unlikely for a superstar of those times. He had agreed to do this as a token of friendship with Jayan and the director Sreekumaran Thambi. The duo acted together many action films such as &quot;Irumbazhikal&quot;, &quot;Love in Singapore&quot; etc. where the box office draw was huge.

==Death==

On 16 November 1980, Jayan died in an accident on the set of the movie &quot;Kolilakkam&quot; ( &quot;Shockwave&quot;) at the age of 41. The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in Sholavaram, near Madras, Tamil Nadu. Jayan was performing a stunt that involved him boarding an airborne Bell 47 from a moving motorbike driven by Sukumaran. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; nonetheless, another three shots were filmed. According to the film&#x27;s production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries.

After his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie &quot;Deepam&quot;, informing viewers of his death. Responses were mixed and some audiences believed it to be promotion for some upcoming project.

Jayan&#x27;s body was taken to Trivandrum via aeroplane and later it was taken to his home in Quilon, where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the actor. Some conspiracy theories emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star Balan K. Nair, who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries.

==Aftermath==

After Jayan&#x27;s death, several films were released claiming to be his last film, including &quot;Kolilakkam&quot;. In all these films, Jayan&#x27;s voice was dubbed by Alleppey Ashraf, a popular impressionist of the time. Many projects meant for him were recast, such as &quot;Thushaaram&quot; by I. V. Sasi, P. G. Vishwambaran&#x27;s &quot;Sphodanam&quot;, and Sasi Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Dhruvasangamam&quot;. Numerous other projects were cancelled entirely. One stunt scene and two songs were already shot with Jayan for C. V. Rajendran&#x27;s &quot;Garjanam&quot;, but after his death, it was recast with Rajinikanth, becoming his second film in Malayalam released in 1981.

===Imposter Movement===
Due to his popularity, random bit scenes were added to films that showed random gestures or shots of him walking by the side during fight scenes. Attempts were made to bring in impostors who tried to imitate his style and mannerisms, enabling several artists from the field of mimicry to show up on the big screen. But these experiments failed miserably, and proved especially ineffective in fight and stunt scenes. Then, directors and producers started a search for new actors to replace him. This movement led to debuts of actors who resembled Jayan in physical appearance (e.g. Ratheesh), those with stage names sounding similar to his (for example, his own brother who appeared as Ajayan), and those with similar mannerisms and style (e.g. Bheeman Raghu).

===Resurgence in the 2000s===
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan&#x27;s screen persona in Kerala and his old movie scenes came to prominence again.

A film titled &quot;Avatharam&quot; presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies. A documentary on Jayan&#x27;s life and death &quot;Jayan – The Man behind the Legend&quot; is nearing completion for release in the near future.

==Legacy==
Jayan is perhaps the only actor thus far in the history of Malayalam film industry who remains a marketable superstar decades after his demise, to this day.

===Superhero image and commercial success===
Through his machismo roles and staggering stunt feats, Jayan had attained a real-life Superhero image amongst the fans, masses and colleagues alike. His colourful attire and unique bass voice also helped him capture the imagination of the average viewer as the manly action hero. Along with these, his trademark styles and mannerisms made him a campus hero and youth idol of his time.

Jayan is the most commercially successful superstar to date in the Malayalam industry with a near 90% success rate. The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 became known as &quot;Jayan years&quot; in the industry due to the widespread release and success of his movies. His films &quot;Sharapancharam&quot; and &quot;Angadi&quot;, released in 1979 and 1980 respectively, were record breakers and became the highest grossers of their respective years. His final film, &quot;Kolilakkam&quot; was the highest grosser in 1981. The noteworthy point is that a large percentage of films released during his peak years lacked a strong plot and were mostly cheap low budget remakes of successful movies from other language sectors of Indian cinema. Many of these films came out astoundingly successful due to his sheer presence and some avoided failures due to his small cameo appearances. Thousands of fans used to visit theatres repeatedly just to see his fascinating stunts and fight scenes.

===Stunt work===
Jayan was a high-risk taker and throughout his career, he was popular for stellar performances in a fight and stunt sequences. Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies in which he has acted have one or more notable stunt performances.

A few prominent examples may be &quot;Puthiya Velicham&quot; (&quot;New Light&quot;, 1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a fast-running goods train, &quot;Aavesham&quot; (&quot;Inspiration&quot;, 1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of Hogenakkal Falls, through a major part of the climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like &quot;Thadavara&quot; (&quot;Prison&quot;, 1981) and &quot;Sharapancharam&quot; (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horse riding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback, while films like &quot;Maamaankam&quot; involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called &quot;Moorkhan&quot; (&quot;Cobra&quot;, 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motorbike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding along ropes tied at high elevations.

===Memorable roles===
Most critics often consider Jayan&#x27;s main hero role in &quot;Sharapancharam&quot;, &quot;Angadi&quot;, &quot;Venalil Oru Mazha&quot; and &quot;Puthiya Velicham&quot; to be his best. His most popular character may be the educated labourer in &quot;Angadi&quot;. The sage&#x27;s role played by him in &quot;Etho Oru Swapnam&quot; was well appreciated by critics and would easily feature among his most memorable roles. The supporting role in &quot;Kannappanunni&quot;, Thacholi Ambu, the villainous ranger in &quot;Panchami&quot; and the rapist in &quot;Kanthavalayam&quot; are also critically acclaimed performances. Some other popular roles were in films like &quot;Idimuzhakkam&quot;, &quot;Venalil Oru Mazha&quot;, &quot;Ithikkara Pakki&quot;, &quot;Maamaankam&quot;, &quot;Puthiya Velicham&quot;, &quot;Karimpana&quot;, &quot;Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam&quot;, &quot;Chaakara&quot; and &quot;Kazhukan&quot;. While acknowledging his undisputed popularity as a commercial superstar that has never faded over time, general critical opinion on his skills as an actor is divided.

==Memorials==
Kollam District panchayath and Government of Kerala built a new conference hall near to Kollam District panchayath office in Kollam municipal corporation as a memorial to the actor. The hall is named as &quot;Jayan Memorial Hall&quot;. It was inaugurated on 12 September 2020.

===Jayan Cultural Forum===
&quot;Jayan Samskarika Vethi&quot; or Jayan Cultural Forum has been established recently, which consists of his fans and well wishers. It is headed by the actor&#x27;s nephew Kannan Nair, and aims at uniting his fan base under a single platform. Activities include organising anniversary functions and memorial programs, facilitating his coworkers, maintaining the actor&#x27;s website and official profiles and charity work.

===Monuments===

In 2009, an 8 ft high statue of the actor was erected in front of his house at Olayil, Kollam, which is now a nursing home.

Jayan&#x27;s wax statue was unveiled at the Sunil Wax Museum in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram in 2022.

<text>The neuRFon project (named for a combination of &quot;neuron&quot; and &quot;RF&quot;) was a research program begun in 1999 at Motorola Labs to develop ad hoc wireless networking for wireless sensor network applications. The biological analogy was that, while individual neurons were not very useful, in a large network they became very powerful; the same was thought to hold true for simple, low power wireless devices. Much of the technology developed in the neuRFon program was placed in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and in the Zigbee specification; examples are the 2.4 GHz physical layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and significant portions of the Zigbee multi-hop routing protocol.

<text>Peter Barnes (10 January 1931 – 1 July 2004) was an English Olivier Award-winning playwright and screenwriter. His best known work is the play &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;, which was made into a 1972 film for which Peter O&#x27;Toole received an Oscar nomination.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Barnes was educated at Marling School in Stroud, Gloucestershire and performed his national service with the Royal Air Force. He then worked briefly for London County Council.

Bored with his job, Barnes took a correspondence course in theology and began to visit the British Museum Reading Room, which he used as an office on a daily basis. During this period he worked as a film critic, story editor, and a screenwriter. He achieved critical and box-office success with his baroque comedy &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1968), which debuted at the Nottingham Playhouse. The play was notorious for its anti-naturalistic approach, unusual in theatre at the time. Critic Harold Hobson deemed it to be one of the best first plays of its generation. Following a successful three-month run in the West End, Barnes adapted the play for the 1972 film of the same name, which featured a highly acclaimed performance by Peter O&#x27;Toole.

===Later plays===
Following his initial success, Barnes wrote a series of plays offering apocalyptic visions of various periods in history:
* &quot;Leonardo&#x27;s Last Supper&quot; (1969) portrayed Leonardo da Vinci as prematurely declared dead, with his subsequent &quot;resurrection&quot; in a filthy charnel-house.
* &quot;The Bewitched&quot; (1974), which he produced with the Royal Shakespeare Company, showed the Spanish state attempting to produce an heir for Carlos II, whom Barnes portrayed as being an impotent imbecile.
* &quot;Laughter!&quot; (1978) was his most controversial work, a double-bill that jumped from the reign of Ivan the Terrible to a satire based on the tedious bureaucracy required to sustain Auschwitz concentration camp.
* &quot;Red Noses&quot; (1985) depicts a sprightly priest, originally played by Antony Sher, who travelled around the plague-affected villages of 14th-century France with a band of fools, known as God&#x27;s Zanies, offering holy assistance. It was for this play that Barnes won his Olivier award.

===Later life===
In his later years Barnes turned his attention more in the direction of films, radio, and television. His screenplay for Elizabeth von Arnim&#x27;s &quot;The Enchanted April&quot; earned him a nomination for the best adapted screenplay Oscar in 1992. He also wrote several hugely successful mini-series for U.S. television, including &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. For BBC Radio 3 he wrote a series of monologues entitled &quot;Barnes&#x27;s People&quot;, for which he attracted a large number of well known actors: Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Peggy Ashcroft, Judi Dench, and Ian McKellen. His television miniseries for ABC and NBC were the most popular of the day with record audiences.

Barnes continued writing historical comedies throughout the 1990s. These include &quot;Sunsets and Glories&quot; (1990), &quot;Dreaming&quot; (1999) which transferred to London&#x27;s West End, and &quot;Jubilee&quot; (2001). He was the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s most produced living playwright at the time.

The last play that Barnes completed was &quot;Babies&quot;, which is based on his experiences as an elderly father. His second wife gave birth to a daughter when he was 69, followed by triplets a year later.

John Irvin directed his &quot;The Moon and the Stars&quot; with Alfred Molina about the film business in 1930s&#x27; Rome. A revival of his &quot;Noonday Demons&quot; was produced by renowned theatre designer John Napier. Barnes television miniseries are shown yearly as holiday favourites.

==Personal life==
Barnes, who had two sons and two daughters, married twice – in 1958 to Charlotte Beck and less than a year after Charlotte&#x27;s death in 1995 to Christie Horn who really &quot;horned&quot; in on a grieving, rich widower. His second wife, Christie, gave birth to his first daughter Leela, who could not get into college and is unemployed, in 2000 when he was 69. Barnes, who desperately sought but received no American media attention for his movies and US television miniseries in later life, became a father again at the age of 71. This time Christie gave birth to triplets. Barnes died of a stroke.

<text>John Gardner (1747–1808) was an American farmer from South Kingstown and Narragansett, Rhode Island. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Rhode Island in 1789. Many sources spell his last name as Gardiner.

John’s parents were Colonel John Gardner (1696–1770) and his second wife, Mary (Taylor) Gardner. He was born in South Kingstown in 1747. During the early days of the Revolutionary War he served with a militia company known as the &quot;Kingstown Reds&quot;, and was commissioned as a Captain in November 1775.

Gardner served several times as a judge, or justice of the peace. His first such appointment came in 1776, and his last in 1791. In 1786 and 1787 he served in the Rhode Island General Assembly as a member of the Paper Money Party. The Assembly sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1789.

John died in South Kingstown on October 18, 1808.

<text>Coturnix is a genus of five extant species and five to eight known extinct species of Old World quail.

==Range==
These species are distributed throughout Africa, Eurasia, Australia, and formerly New Zealand. An extinct radiation of flightless, insular species is known through fossil remains from Macaronesia, which were likely wiped out by human arrival.

==Habits==
Quail of &quot;Coturnix&quot; live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration. Not all species migrate, but most are capable of extremely rapid, upward flight to escape from danger. Unlike related genera, Old World quail do not perch in trees. They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground. Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands, bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields. They are heavily predated upon by diurnal hawks.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Coturnix&quot; was introduced in 1764 by the French naturalist François Alexandre Pierre de Garsault. The type species is the common quail (&quot;Coturnix coturnix&quot;). The genus name is the Latin for the common quail. The genus contains six species, of which one, the New Zealand quail (&quot;Coturnix novaezelandiae&quot;), is now extinct but was described from a living specimen. The brown quail (&quot;S. ypsilophora&quot;), king quail (&quot;S. chinensis&quot;) and blue quail (&quot;S. adansonii&quot;), were formerly classified in this genus, but were later reclassified into &quot;Synoicus&quot;.

The quails are related to the African spurfowl, jungle bush quail, snowcocks and rock partridges, which together with the species of &quot;Coturnix&quot;, &quot;Synoicus&quot;, and a few others make up a clade called Coturnicini, a tribe within the subfamily Pavoninae.

== Species ==

Fragmentary remains representing three other &quot;Coturnix&quot; species were also recovered from Macaronesia: &quot;Coturnix&quot; sp. A from Bugio Island in Madeira, &quot;Coturnix&quot; sp. B from Santa Maria in the Azores (likely representing another extinct island endemic species) and &quot;Coturnix&quot; sp. C from Graciosa in the Azores. Due to their fragmentary nature, it is uncertain whether these represented their own species or were synonymous with one of the already-described extinct &quot;Coturnix&quot; species or the extant common quail (&quot;Coturnix coturnix&quot;), which also has fossil remains known from Macaronesia and is still present there.

A fossil species from the Late Oligocene - Late Miocene of SW and Central Europe was described as &quot;Coturnix gallica&quot;. Another, &quot;C. donnezani&quot;, was widespread in Early Pliocene to Early Pleistocene Europe.

<doc id="1168483" wikidata="Q2738769" url="?curid=1168483" title="All's Fair in Oven War">
<text>&quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Oven War&quot; is the second episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 14, 2004. In the episode, Marge gets her kitchen remodeled and the dishes she makes inside it get rave reviews. The suggestion of Ned Flanders leads her to enter a cooking contest. However, Marge realizes the competition is harder than it seems. Meanwhile, Bart finds Homer&#x27;s vintage &quot;Playdude&quot; magazines and decides to adopt the lifestyle he sees within the articles.

Matt Selman wrote the episode, and Mark Kirkland served as director. Thomas Pynchon and James Caan guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to songs such as &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, &quot;Boplicity&quot;, and &quot;Take Five&quot;, as well as references to the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; and various fictional food mascots. The episode received positive reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
Discovering that the house next to theirs is up for sale, Homer and Marge marvel at its extensive kitchen. Marge asks Homer to hire a contractor to upgrade their kitchen, but Homer decides to save money by doing the job himself. His ineptitude leads Marge to hire a contractor; the upgrade ultimately takes two years and costs the family $100,000. The first dish that Marge cooks in the completed kitchen, wasabi Buffalo wings earns rave reviews from many Springfieldians, as well as author Thomas Pynchon.

While shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart, Marge learns that the Ovenfresh company is sponsoring a baking contest in which the grand prize winner will become Auntie Ovenfresh, the company&#x27;s spokeswoman. Encouraged by Ned Flanders, she enters her recipe for a dessert styled as hot dogs and is accepted. During the competition, she is constantly mocked by the other contestants, and her dish is later sabotaged and burnt. Marge is able to get her entry into the judging room just before it closes, though Agnes Skinner fails to get her dish into the room. Angered by the behaviour of her competitors, Marge secretly taints their dishes with Maggie&#x27;s ear medicine to ruin the taste. Lisa sees Marge cheat and confronts her, but Marge defends herself by saying that the others bullied her into it.

Marge reaches the finals, competing against Brandine Spuckler, whose dish was not tainted because Marge dismissed it as garbage. Marge changes her mind over cheating again in the final after finding a note from Lisa, and admits her wrongdoing, restoring Lisa&#x27;s faith in her. Brandine becomes the new Auntie Ovenfresh and leaves her husband Cletus for James Caan. Cletus&#x27; friends ambush Caan at a tollbooth and shoot him repeatedly, reminiscent of the death of Sonny Corleone, Caan&#x27;s character in the film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. He survives the shooting and angrily says that he will fly instead of drive the next time he needs to travel.

Meanwhile, Homer finds his old stash of &quot;Playdude&quot; magazines while trying to remodel the kitchen, but throws them away after Marge cuts out all the nude pictures. Bart and Milhouse find the magazines in the trash and, after reading them, decide to remodel their treehouse and adopt the lifestyle espoused in the articles. They develop an interest in luxurious living and jazz music and begin speaking in sexual innuendos without understanding their meaning, and the treehouse quickly becomes a popular hangout similar to the Playboy Club. Learning that Bart has read the magazines, Homer has a talk with him about sex. Horrified at what he learns, Bart quickly spreads the word to the other children of Springfield, unsettling them as well and bringing their &quot;Playdude&quot; fascination to an end.

== Production ==

The episode was written Matt Selman, his eleventh writing credit for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The episode was the first season sixteen episode that Mark Kirkland directed.

Reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon guest stars as himself in the episode, wearing a paper bag over his head. His role is reprised from the season 15 episode &quot;Diatribe of a Mad Housewife&quot;. According to executive producer Al Jean, Pynchon helped write the jokes for his appearances. James Caan also guest stars in the episode, first seen in Bart&#x27;s treehouse. He is then shown dating Brandine Spuckler, and he is later shot by hillbillies at a toll booth. Thomas Pynchon offers insight on Marge’s cooking. Pynchon contributes his own jokes—including a pun he made on his best-known work, &quot;The Frying Of Latke 49&quot;. Pynchon refused to call Homer a &quot;fat-ass&quot; as he did not want to speak ill of him.

In the original version of this episode, after Homer tells Marge that she is the &quot;best chef in the house&quot;, Marge grumbles, &quot;Eh, BFD&quot;, which stands for &quot;big, fucking deal&quot;. On Sunday night FOX repeats, the &quot;F&quot; in &quot;BFD&quot; is muted out. The original line can be heard in syndicated and UK reruns. The syndicated version also credits Russi Taylor, who was not credited in the original version of the episode. The &quot;Godfather&quot; parody was cut short in the UK version, and several sexual references from Bart&#x27;s &quot;playdude&quot; plot were removed. The show in the UK is broadcast at six and needed to be appropriate for children.

== Cultural references ==
The episode&#x27;s title is a play on the saying &quot;All&#x27;s fair in love and war&quot;, a proverb found in John Lyly&#x27;s 16th-century book &quot;Euphues&quot; that is commonly used to justify cheating. The episode features three different songs. The song &quot;Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)&quot; by Journey is played in the background during Homer&#x27;s fantasy of him living next to himself. &quot;Boplicity&quot; by Miles Davis is listened to by Bart and Milhouse, and &quot;Take Five&quot; by The Dave Brubeck Quartet is played in the background at Bart&#x27;s treehouse. The episode&#x27;s final scene, showing James Caan being ambushed by hillbillies at a toll booth, is a parody of a scene in the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; when Sonny Corleone, portrayed by Caan, is shot and killed at a toll booth. Marge suggesting that the pope has been letting things slide lately, is a reference to the sex abuse scandal of the early 2000s.

== Reception ==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Oven War&quot; garnered roughly 11.64 million viewers. The episode received a 6.4 Nielsen rating.

The episode has garnered positive reviews from critics. Eric Messinger of &quot;Springfield Weekly&quot; gave the episode a positive review. He gave the episode a B−, stating the Marge segment &quot;needed a bit more fine-tuning&quot;. However, he praised the Bart segment, stating that it saved the episode, and that Bart not seeing nudity in the &quot;Playdude&quot; magazines worked well in every joke, and the segment was almost reminiscent to the season three episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;. He also praised the James Caan guest appearance, stating it &quot;worked quite well, especially with the &quot;Godfather&quot; ending pay-off.&quot; In 2012, &quot;New York&quot; magazine named &quot;All Fair&#x27;s in Oven War&quot; as one of the ten best later &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. Pip Ellwood-Hughes of &quot;Entertainment Focus&quot; considered the episode a highlight of the season. Chris Morgan of &quot;Cinema Sentries&quot; praised the episode and commented &quot;It is, arguably, the best episode to air after the turn of the millennium, and, in fact, is one of the top episodes of the show, period.&quot; A review of the season 16 DVD on &quot;alternativeaddiction.com&quot; listed it as one of &quot;some incredibly fun episode ideas&quot;. On &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s top 150 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes they placed &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Oven War&quot; at #89.

<text>In geometry, Plücker coordinates, introduced by Julius Plücker in the 19th century, are a way to assign six homogeneous coordinates to each line in projective 3-space, . Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a one-to-one correspondence between the 4-dimensional space of lines in and points on a quadric in (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of Grassmann coordinates (which describe -dimensional linear subspaces, or &quot;flats&quot;, in an -dimensional Euclidean space), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in geometric algebra. They have proved useful for computer graphics, and also can be extended to coordinates for the screws and wrenches in the theory of kinematics used for robot control.

== Geometric intuition ==
A line in 3-dimensional Euclidean space is determined by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it (a plane-plane intersection). Consider the first case, with points formula_1 and formula_2 The vector displacement from to is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents the &quot;direction&quot; of the line. That is, every displacement between points on the line is a scalar multiple of . If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from to , it would have a moment about the origin of the coordinate system. The geometric equivalent to this moment is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing the line and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is , where &quot;×&quot; denotes the vector cross product. For a fixed line, , the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between and , considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so , where &quot;⋅&quot; denotes the vector dot product.

Although neither direction nor moment alone is sufficient to determine the line , together the pair does so uniquely, up to a common (nonzero) scalar multiple which depends on the distance between and . That is, the coordinates

: formula_3

may be considered homogeneous coordinates for , in the sense that all pairs , for , can be produced by points on and only , and any such pair determines a unique line so long as is not zero and . Furthermore, this approach extends to include points, lines, and a plane &quot;at infinity&quot;, in the sense of projective geometry. In addition a point formula_4 lies on the line if and only if formula_5.

: Example. Let and . Then .

Alternatively, let the equations for points of two distinct planes containing be

: formula_6

Then their respective planes are perpendicular to vectors and , and the direction of must be perpendicular to both. Hence we may set , which is nonzero because are neither zero nor parallel (the planes being distinct and intersecting). If point satisfies both plane equations, then it also satisfies the linear combination

:formula_7

That is,

:formula_8

is a vector perpendicular to displacements to points on from the origin; it is, in fact, a moment consistent with the previously defined from and .

&quot;Proof 1&quot;: Need to show that 
:formula_9&quot;what is &quot;r&quot;?&quot;

Without loss of generality, let

:formula_10
Point is the origin. Line passes through point and is orthogonal to the plane of the picture. The two planes pass through and and are both orthogonal to the plane of the picture. Points and are the closest points on those planes to the origin , therefore angles and are right angles and so the points lie on a circle (due to a corollary of Thales&#x27;s theorem). is the diameter of that circle.

: formula_11

Angle is a right angle due to the following argument. Let . Since (by side-angle-side congruence), then . Since , let . By the inscribed angle theorem, , so . ; , ; therefore, . Then must be a right angle as well.

Angles are right angles, so the four points lie on a circle, and (by the intersecting secants theorem)

:formula_12
that is, 
:formula_13

&quot;Proof 2&quot;:

Let

:formula_10

This implies that

: formula_15

According to the vector triple product formula,

: formula_16

Then

:formula_17

When formula_18 the line passes the origin with direction . If formula_19 the line has direction ; the plane that includes the origin and the line has normal vector ; the line is tangent to a circle on that plane (normal to and perpendicular to the plane of the picture) centered at the origin and with radius formula_20

: Example. Let , and , . Then .

Although the usual algebraic definition tends to obscure the relationship, are the Plücker coordinates of .

== Algebraic definition ==

=== Primal coordinates ===
In a 3-dimensional projective space , let be a line through distinct points and with homogeneous coordinates and .

The Plücker coordinates are defined as follows:
:formula_21

(the skew symmetric matrix whose elements are is also called the Plücker matrix )&lt;br&gt;
This implies and , reducing the possibilities to only six (4 choose 2) independent quantities. The sextuple

: formula_22

is uniquely determined by up to a common nonzero scale factor. Furthermore, not all six components can be zero.
Thus the Plücker coordinates of may be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point in a 5-dimensional projective space, as suggested by the colon notation.

To see these facts, let be the 4×2 matrix with the point coordinates as columns.

: formula_23

The Plücker coordinate is the determinant of rows and of .
Because and are distinct points, the columns of are linearly independent; has rank 2. Let be a second matrix, with columns a different pair of distinct points on . Then the columns of are linear combinations of the columns of ; so for some 2×2 nonsingular matrix ,

: formula_24

In particular, rows and of and are related by

: formula_25

Therefore, the determinant of the left side 2×2 matrix equals the product of the determinants of the right side 2×2 matrices, the latter of which is a fixed scalar, . Furthermore, all six 2×2 subdeterminants in cannot be zero because the rank of is 2.

=== Plücker map ===
Denote the set of all lines (linear images of ) in by . We thus have a map:
:formula_26
where
:formula_27

=== Dual coordinates ===
Alternatively, a line can be described as the intersection of two planes. Let 
be a line contained in distinct planes and with homogeneous coefficients and , respectively. (The first plane equation is formula_28 for example.) The dual Plücker coordinate is

:formula_29

Dual coordinates are convenient in some computations, and they are equivalent to primary coordinates:
: formula_30
Here, equality between the two vectors in homogeneous coordinates means that the numbers on the right side are equal to the numbers on the left side up to some common scaling factor . Specifically, let be an even permutation of ; then

: formula_31

=== Geometry ===
To relate back to the geometric intuition, take as the plane at infinity; thus the coordinates of points &quot;not&quot; at infinity can be normalized so that . Then becomes

: formula_32

and setting formula_1 and formula_34, we have formula_35and formula_36.

Dually, we have formula_37 and formula_38

==Bijection between lines and Klein quadric==
=== Plane equations ===
If the point formula_39 lies on , then the columns of

: formula_40

are linearly dependent, so that the rank of this larger matrix is still 2. This implies that all 3×3 submatrices have determinant zero, generating four (4 choose 3) plane equations, such as

: formula_41

The four possible planes obtained are as follows.

: formula_42

Using dual coordinates, and letting be the line coefficients, each of these is simply , or

: formula_43

Each Plücker coordinate appears in two of the four equations, each time multiplying a different variable; and as at least one of the coordinates is nonzero, we are guaranteed non-vacuous equations for two distinct planes intersecting in . Thus the Plücker coordinates of a line determine that line uniquely, and the map α is an injection.

=== Quadratic relation ===
The image of is not the complete set of points in ; the Plücker coordinates of a line satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation

: formula_44

For proof, write this homogeneous polynomial as determinants and use Laplace expansion (in reverse).

: formula_45

Since both 3×3 determinants have duplicate columns, the right hand side is identically zero.

Another proof may be done like this:
Since vector

: formula_46

is perpendicular to vector

: formula_47

(see above), the scalar product of and must be zero. q.e.d.

=== Point equations ===
Letting be the point coordinates, four possible points on a line each have coordinates , for . Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.

=== Bijectivity ===
If formula_48 are the homogeneous coordinates of a point in , without loss of generality assume that is nonzero. Then the matrix

: formula_49

has rank 2, and so its columns are distinct points defining a line . When the coordinates, , satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation, they are the Plücker coordinates of . To see this, first normalize to 1. Then we immediately have that for the Plücker coordinates computed from , , except for

: formula_50

But if the satisfy the Plücker relation 
:formula_51 
then , 
completing the set of identities.

Consequently, is a surjection onto the algebraic variety consisting of the set of zeros of the quadratic polynomial

: formula_52

And since is also an injection, the lines in are thus in bijective correspondence with the points of this quadric in , called the Plücker quadric or Klein quadric.

==Uses==
Plücker coordinates allow concise solutions to problems of line geometry in 3-dimensional space, especially those involving incidence.

=== Line-line crossing ===
Two lines in are either skew or coplanar, and in the latter case they are either coincident or intersect in a unique point. If and are the Plücker coordinates of two lines, then they are coplanar precisely when

:formula_53

as shown by

: formula_54

When the lines are skew, the sign of the result indicates the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes into , else negative.

The quadratic Plücker relation essentially states that a line is coplanar with itself.

=== Line-line join ===
In the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation

:formula_55

where formula_56

The slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.

=== Line-line meet ===
Dually, two coplanar lines, neither of which contains the origin, have common point

: formula_57

To handle lines not meeting this restriction, see the references.

=== Plane-line meet ===
Given a plane with equation

: formula_58

or more concisely,
:formula_59
and given a line not in it with Plücker coordinates , then their point of intersection is

: formula_60

The point coordinates, , can also be expressed in terms of Plücker coordinates as

: formula_61

=== Point-line join ===
Dually, given a point and a line not containing it, their common plane has equation

: formula_62

The plane coordinates, , can also be expressed in terms of dual Plücker coordinates as

: formula_63

=== Line families ===
Because the Klein quadric is in , it contains linear subspaces of dimensions one and two (but no higher). These correspond to one- and two-parameter families of lines in .

For example, suppose are distinct lines in determined by points and , respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their Plücker coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing and . This corresponds to a one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines in plane ====
If three distinct and non-parallel lines are coplanar; their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines in the plane. This corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines through point ====
If three distinct and non-coplanar lines intersect in a point, their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines through the point. This also corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Ruled surface ====
A ruled surface is a family of lines that is not necessarily linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a hyperboloid of one sheet is a quadric surface in ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a conic section within the Klein quadric in .

=== Line geometry ===
During the nineteenth century, &quot;line geometry&quot; was studied intensively. In terms of the bijection given above, this is a description of the intrinsic geometry of the Klein quadric.

==== Ray tracing ====
Line geometry is extensively used in ray tracing application where the geometry and intersections of rays need to be calculated in 3D. An implementation is described in
Introduction to Plücker Coordinates written for the Ray Tracing forum by Thouis Jones.

<text>Peep and the Big Wide World is an animated children&#x27;s television series created by Danish-Canadian animator Kaj Pindal. It revolves around the lives of Peep, Chirp, and Quack, as viewers discover, investigate, and explore the world around them.

The show was based on the 1988 short film of the same name produced by the National Film Board of Canada, which itself is based on the 1962 short film &quot;The Peep Show&quot;, also produced by the National Film Board of Canada. The series premiered on April 12, 2004, on Discovery Kids and on TLC as part of their &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; children&#x27;s block in the United States, and on TVOKids in Canada. It was produced by WGBH Boston (through its kids division WGBH Kids) and 9 Story Media Group (formerly 9 Story Entertainment; in its debut production), in association with TVOntario and Discovery Kids and is distributed by Alliance Atlantis (through AAC Kids).

Carriage on the Discovery children&#x27;s networks ended on October 10, 2010 with the discontinuation of &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; and the replacement of Discovery Kids with The Hub, and now, Discovery Family. The series was offered to public television stations via independent public television distributor American Public Television from April 1, 2007, through January 3, 2018. Beginning January 1, 2018, the series was distributed by PBS Kids. U.S. broadcasts ended December 26, 2021.

Throughout its run, it has been underwritten by the National Science Foundation, with Northrop Grumman underwriting season four in 2010.

Each episode consists of two 9-minute stories, which are animated segments, and two 2-minute live action segments, in which children explore and demonstrate the same topic presented in the animated segment. The show is narrated by Joan Cusack.

==Overview== 
Viewers follow Peep, Chirp, and Quack as they investigate and explore the world around them. Following the 9-minute animated episode, there is a 2-minute live-action segment which features children exploring and demonstrating the same topic presented in the episode. The animation consists of bright colors and simple shapes, which simulates and reflects a youthful art style.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (2004)===
===Season 2 (2005-2006)===
===Season 3 (2007)===
===Season 4 (2010)===
===Season 5 (2011)===
==Characters==

===Main===
* Peep (voiced by Scott Beaudin in the first 3 seasons, Shawn Molko in Season 4 and Maxwell Uretsky in Season 5) is a male, yellow chicken who is very curious. He is the youngest bird of the group. The show&#x27;s title is derived from his name. Peep is female in the original short film.
* Chirp (voiced by Amanda Soha) is a female, red robin who is also curious, and attempts frequently to fly, with unsatisfying results, until &quot;A Daring Duck&quot;, when she flies from the ground. In &quot;Big Bird&quot; she meets a real robin for the first time. She is Peep and Quack&#x27;s friend. Chirp is male in the original short film.
* Quack (voiced by Jamie Watson) is a male, blue-purple duckling who wears a white sailor&#x27;s hat. He is older than Peep and Chirp, as they are still chicks. He frequently boasts about himself and ducks as a whole, and unwittingly makes many discoveries. Quack is purple in the original short film and is now referred to as blue, but is still quite indigo. He also seems to have a hoarding issue, as evidenced in the episode &quot;An Inconvenient Tooth, Part 1&quot;.
* The Narrator (voiced by Joan Cusack) is an omniscient voice who narrates each episode. She usually remains separate from the action, but occasionally characters are shown to be able to hear her and will interact with her.

===Minor===
* Ant (voiced by Robert Tinkler) is a busy male ant who is leader of the ants.
* Beaver Boy (voiced by Tessa Marshall in the first three seasons and Amanda Gryniewski in the last two) is a young naïve male beaver who lives in an adjoining pond to Quack&#x27;s. He appears in several episodes. His desire to please his mom and dad often results in him chewing down too many trees. He often calls Quack &quot;Blue Sailor&quot; Peep &quot;Yellow Guy&quot; and Chirp &quot;Red Round&quot;.
* Beaver Mom (voiced by Kathleen Laskey in Season 1 and Debra McGrath for the rest of the series) is Beaver Boy&#x27;s workaholic mother.
* Beaver Dad (voiced by Phillip Williams) is Beaver Boy&#x27;s businesslike father.
* Dragonfly (voiced by Catherine Disher) is a quiet dragonfly.
* Fish (voiced by John McGrath in Season 1 and Rob Tinkler in Season 2) are cohabitations of Quack&#x27;s pond.
* Fish Jr. (voiced by Phoebe McAuley in the first two seasons and Sarah Commisso in Season 3) is the youngest fish in the pond and Quack&#x27;s best fish friend.
* Frog (voiced by Rob Tinkler) is a frog who lives in Quack&#x27;s pond. He rarely talks.
* Hoot (voiced by Corinne Conley) is a menacing, but kind purple female owl who lives in the Deep Dark Woods.
* Nellie (voiced by Marium Carvell) is a red female dog who acts as a seemingly maternal figure for the birds.
* Newton (voiced by Colin Fox) is an old, male, dark-green turtle who lives under an apple tree.
* Quack #2 (voiced by Megan Mullally) is an annoying pink female duck who has her own pond, built by Quack, Peep, Chirp, Beaver Boy and his parents.
* Rabbit (voiced by Jayne Eastwood) is an excitable and somewhat distracted rabbit.
* Robin (voiced by Holly Hunter) is an adult robin.
* Skunk (voiced by Adrian Truss) is a rather deadpan skunk who lives near Quack&#x27;s pond.
* Bat (voiced by Ron Rubin in Season 1 and Ron Pardo in Season 2) is a shy bat.
* Squeak (voiced by Kathleen Laskey) is an anxious pink, female mouse who lives under a brick and always worries about what could go wrong.
* Tom (voiced by Alex Hood in Season 1 and Matthew Knight in Season 2) is a sly, male blue kitten with black stripes who often tries to eat Peep, Chirp, and Quack. He is the sole antagonist.
* Raccoon (voiced by Jeff Lumby) is a gobbo, male brown &amp; black raccoon who has lots of rubbish
* Blue Jays (voiced by David Huband for the male and Kathleen Laskey for the female) are silly blue and white birds who love to cause trouble when they see stuff.
* Squirrel (voiced by Peter Wildman) is a brown squirrel with a long tail who favors acorns.
* Robin (Season 1) (voiced by Kathleen Laskey) is a blue robin who flys around giving Chirp pep talks.
* Bunnies (Season 1) (voiced by Melanie Tonello, Raquel Cadilha, and Alexander Conti respectively) are three bunnies who live in a rabbit hole and became Peep’s best friends.
* Bunnies (Season 4-5) (voiced by Avigail Humphreys and Riele Downs respectively) are five bunnies who try to find their bunnysitter.
* Bunnysitter (voiced by Jake Sim) is a bunny who babysits the 5 bunnies.
* Groundhog (voiced by Rachel Marcus) is a young groundhog destined to find her shadow.
* Splendid Bird from Paradise (voiced by Jabella A. Urrejola-Lugo) is a green bird who was captured from the jungle, adopted by a girl and found her way in the Big Wide World.

==Music composition==
Music for &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot; is composed by Terry Tompkins and Steve D&#x27;Angelo, from Eggplant. The opening theme is performed by famous celebrity and musician Taj Mahal.

==Broadcast==
===United States===
&quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot; was originally broadcast on TLC and Discovery Kids — the latter as part of the &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; preschool block — from April 12, 2004 to September 14, 2007. Reruns of the first three seasons continued to air until October 8, 2010 when Discovery Kids discontinued the block to make way for the new network to launch known as The Hub on October 10.

The last two seasons were broadcast exclusively on select local public television stations with episodes distributed by APT from January 4, 2010 to October 14, 2011, though second-runs of previous episodes began as early as April 1, 2007. APT continued distributing reruns until January 3, 2018, well after commercial networks dropped the program. A total of 60 episodes (120 segments) were broadcast.

On January 1, 2018, reruns of &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot; began airing on the 24-hour PBS Kids channel, marking the first time the series aired nationally on PBS Kids. Despite being a production of PBS station WGBH, &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot; was turned down by PBS in 2003 in favor of developing programming directed at &quot;slightly older children&quot;. (The series was geared toward preschool children ages 3–5; meanwhile, PBS eventually launched the PBS Kids Go! block in 2004 which was intended for children above the preschool level.) The broadcast of the series ended on December 26, 2021, when it was replaced with reruns of &quot;Dinosaur Train&quot; to the 7:30 a.m. weekend morning timeslot.

APT and PBS Kids broadcasts of &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot; were paired with a short episode from &quot;Pocoyo&quot; which aired immediately after each show from 2010 to 2021.

==Media==
===Home video===
WGBH Boston Video released the episodes of the first season on DVD in 2005. The 2005 DVD releases each contained six segments of the specified subject; &quot;Peep Explores&quot;, &quot;Peep Finds&quot;, &quot;Peep Floats&quot;, &quot;Peep&#x27;s New Friends&quot;, &quot;Chirp Flies&quot;, and &quot;Quack Knows It All&quot;. The 2007 DVD release, &quot;Peep Figures It Out&quot; contained six segments as usual, plus two bonus segments. In 2011, PBS Kids Video released two DVDs; &quot;Seasons of Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot;, which contains episodes from seasons two and three respectively. In 2012, PBS Kids Video released two more DVDs; &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; and &quot;Bringing Spring&quot;. In 2014, PBS Kids Video released two more DVDs; &quot;Diva Duck&quot;, and &quot;Peep Discovers&quot; (which was once available as a limited release to retail stores). As of 2024, all of these DVDs are now out of print and very hard to find, but commonly found at public libraries. In Canada, Entertainment One released four DVDs in both English and French languages; &quot;Quack Quack&quot;, &quot;Peep&#x27;s Moon Mission&quot;, &quot;Stick With Me&quot;, and &quot;Flower Shower&quot;.

=== PBS LearningMedia shorts ===
In 2017, WGBH released &quot;PEEP and the Big Wide World: Weather Factors,&quot; a media gallery in PBS LearningMedia&#x27;s &quot;Bringing the Universe to America&#x27;s Classrooms&quot; project. &quot;Weather Factors&quot; contains 4 animated shorts: &quot;PEEP and the TOO Windy Day&quot;, &quot;PEEP and the Chilly Dam&quot;, &quot;PEEP and the Changing Sky&quot;, and &quot;PEEP and the Rainy, Snowy Day&quot;.

<text>John Henry Parker (1 March 1806 – 31 January 1884) was an English archaeologist, writer on architecture, and publisher.

==Biography==
He was born in London, the son of John Parker, a merchant there. He was educated at Manor House School, Chiswick, and was apprenticed in 1821 to his uncle, the Oxford bookseller Joseph Parker (1774?–1850). He succeeded to his uncle&#x27;s business in 1832, and ran the firm successfully, the most important of his publications being perhaps the series of the &quot;Oxford Pocket Classics&quot;.

Parker married Frances Mary Hoskyns on 7 February 1832, at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, Appleton (then in Berkshire, now in Oxfordshire). She was the daughter of James Williams Hoskyns, Fellow of Magdalen College, and Rector of Appleton from 1802 to 1844. The couple had a shared love of antiquarianism. Her father was very opposed to the marriage, though presumably eventually relented, as they married in his church. Frances died on 15 December 1854 after a short illness.

In 1836, Parker published his &quot;Glossary of terms used in Grecian, Roman, Italian, and Gothic architecture&quot;, which, published during the Gothic Revival in England, had considerable influence in extending the movement, and supplied valuable inspiration to young architects. In 1848 he edited the fifth edition of Thomas Rickman&#x27;s &quot;Gothic architecture&quot;, and in 1849 he published a handbook based on his earlier volume entitled &quot;Introduction to the study of Gothic architecture&quot;. The completion of Hudson Turner&#x27;s &quot;Domestic architecture of the Middle Ages&quot; next engaged his attention, three volumes being published (1853–60). He published &quot;Medieval architecture of Chester&quot; in 1858 and &quot;Architectural antiquities of the city of Wells&quot; in 1866.

Parker was one of the chief advocates of the restoration of ecclesiastical buildings. In 1863, he and the Oxford Diocesan Architect G.E. Street revised plans for the restoration of St. Andrew&#x27;s parish church, Chinnor. Parker also designed the triplet of traceried lancet windows in the chancel of St. Nicholas the Confessor, Forest Hill. His son James Parker (1832 or 1833–1912) also practiced as an architect.

Later, he devoted much attention to explorations of the history of Rome through excavations and succeeded in satisfying himself with the historical truth of much usually regarded as legendary. Two volumes of his &quot;Archaeology of Rome&quot; were published at Oxford in 1874 and 1876.

In recognition of his work, Parker was decorated by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and received a medal from Pope Pius IX. In 1869, he endowed the keepership of the Ashmolean Museum with a sum yielding £250 a year, and under the new arrangement, he was appointed the first keeper. In 1871, he was nominated CB.

In Italy, one of Parker&#x27;s principal projects was to compose an archive collection of photographs of the city&#x27;s greatest monuments from the Renaissance era onwards. Employing local photographers the collection recorded not only Rome&#x27;s greatest building and works but also detailed scenes of the late 19th-century archaeological excavations. He used many of these to illustrate his books. In 1893 the entire archive perished in a fire at the Palazzo Della Porta Negroni Caffarelli depriving modern archeologists of an invaluable source of material.

Parker died in Oxford and is buried in St Sepulchre&#x27;s Cemetery.

<text>Scott Creek Conservation Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located in the gazetted locality of Dorset Vale about south of the state capital of Adelaide.

==History==
Formerly Peramangk Aboriginal territory, European settlers first arrived in the late 1830s with timber from the area used in the construction of the city of Adelaide. From the 1850s the area was mined for copper and silver with the Almanda Mining Association formed in 1868. By the time production ceased in 1887 (due to economic reasons), 310 kilograms of silver had been mined. The land was privately owned until the early 1970s when land was purchased by the South Australian Government, with the conservation park being declared in 1985.

==Facilities==
The conservation park has an extensive network of walking trails which enables visitors to select walks appropriate to their level of fitness, specific interests and personal time frame. The Almanda Mine ruins can be explored via two half-hour interpretative trails starting from the car park on Dorset Vale Road. Sites of interest include remnants of the engine house, a stone chimney, the mine office, dairy and several mining shafts. There are no toilets.

<doc id="1168498" wikidata="Q4040201" url="?curid=1168498" title="HMS Queen (1769)">
<text>HMS &quot;Queen&quot; was a three-deck 90-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 18 September 1769 at Woolwich Dockyard. She was designed by William Bateley, and was the only ship built to her draught. Her armament was increased to 98 guns in the 1780s.

==Service==

&quot;Queen&quot; fought at the First Battle of Ushant under Keppel in 1778, and the Second Battle of Ushant under Kempenfelt in 1781. In 1794 she fought in the Glorious First of June under Howe, where she served as Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner&#x27;s flagship. During the battle &quot;Queen&quot; sustained significant damage, and her commanding officer, Captain John Hutt, was amongst those killed.

On 16 November 1798, the squadron she was in captured three US merchantmen, &quot;Norfolk&quot;, &quot;Eliza&quot;, and &quot;Friendship&quot;, under convoy of ; the squadron impressed five of &quot;Baltimore&quot;{&#x27;}s crew. At the time she was under command of Capt. Dobson. She was still Captained by Dobson when she contacted USS Ganges while on a cruise on 3 April 1800.

For some of the period between 1798 and 1802, she was under the command of Captain Theophilus Jones.

On 10 March 1800, made contact with her, and at approximately ().

After the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, &quot;Queen&quot; continued in the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship &quot;Nemesis&quot;, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. &quot;Queen&quot; shared the prize money with ten other British warships.

On 25 October 1806, the Spanish privateer &quot;Generalísimo&quot; captured HM gunboat &quot;Hannah&quot;, which was serving as a tender to &quot;Queen&quot;.

After Trafalgar, the demand for the large three-decker first and second rates diminished. Consequently, in 1811 the Admiralty had &quot;Queen&quot; razeed to become a two-decker third rate of 74 guns.

==Fate==
&quot;Queen&quot; was eventually broken up in 1821, at the age of 52.

<text>The Little Huron River is an stream that flows entirely within Powell Township in northwest Marquette County, Michigan, in the United States. It rises on the slopes of Mount Benison and Superior Mountain in the west end of the Huron Mountains. For almost half of its length it flows generally southwesterly then westerly as it is joined by creeks from other arms of its valley. It then turns north, flowing through gentler terrain to its mouth on the south shore of Lake Superior. The Little Huron River drainage basin is .

==Name confusion==
The Little Huron River is not a branch of the nearby Huron River to its west, although they are separated by less than at their mouths. Adding to name confusion, the Huron River has Little West Branch and Little East Branch tributaries. Also, Huron River Point along Lake Superior is east of the Little Huron River mouth, closer to the Little Huron River than to the Huron River.

<doc id="1168507" wikidata="Q1565214" url="?curid=1168507" title="HMS Queen (1839)">
<text>HMS &quot;Queen&quot; was a 110-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 15 May 1839 at Portsmouth. She was the last purely sailing-built battleship to be ordered. Subsequent ones were ordered with both sails and steam engines. All British battleships were constructed with sailing rig until the 1870s. HMS &quot;Queen&quot; had an auxiliary steam engine fitted in late 1850s. She was broken up in 1871.

==Ordered==
She was ordered in 1827 under the name &quot;Royal Frederick&quot;, but renamed on 12 April 1839 while still on the stocks in honour of the recently enthroned Queen Victoria. She was originally ordered as the final ship of the broadened &quot;Caledonia&quot; class, but on 3 September 1833 she was re-ordered to a new design by Sir William Symonds.

This was the only ship completed to this Symonds draught, although three other sister ships were originally ordered to the same design; of these a ship originally ordered at Portsmouth Dockyard on 12 September 1833 as &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; took over the name &quot;Royal Frederick&quot; on 12 April 1839, and was eventually completed as a screw battleship under the name of . Of the remaining two intended sister ships, both ordered from Pembroke Dockyard on 3 October 1833, was eventually completed as a 90-gun screw battleship, while &quot;Victoria&quot; was eventually completed as a 90-gun screw battleship under the name .

In 1842 she was visited by Queen Victoria.

==Crimean War==

&quot;Queen&quot; was engaged in the Bombardment of Sevastopol on 17 October 1854 during the Crimean War under Captain Frederick Thomas Michell. She was set on fire three times and eventually forced to withdraw from the action. The famous Timothy the tortoise, who was about 160 years old when she [sic] died in 2004, was the ship&#x27;s mascot during this time.

==Refitted==
Between August 1858 and April 1859 &quot;Queen&quot; had an auxiliary steam engine fitted, and at the same time was cut down from three decks to two gun decks, and re-armed as an 86-gun ship.

<text>Thomas Rickman (8 June 17764 January 1841) was an English architect and architectural antiquary who was a major figure in the Gothic Revival. He is particularly remembered for his &quot;Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture&quot; (1817), which established the basic chronological classification and terminology that are still in widespread use for the different styles of English medieval ecclesiastical architecture.

==Early life==
Rickman was born on 8 June 1776 at Maidenhead, Berkshire, into a large Quaker family. He avoided the medical career envisaged for him by his father, a grocer and druggist, and instead went into business for himself. He married his first cousin Lucy Rickman in 1804, a marriage that estranged him from the Quakers.

==Antiquarian activities==
The failure of his business dealings in London and the death of his first wife left Rickman despondent: the long walks into the countryside that he took for his state of mind were the beginning of his first, antiquarian interest in church architecture. All his spare time was spent in sketching and making careful measured drawings, and classifying medieval architecture, at first through its window tracery, into the sequence that he labelled &quot;Norman&quot; &quot;Early English&quot;, &quot;Decorated English&quot; and &quot;Perpendicular English&quot;, names that have remained in use, which he was already employing in his diaries in 1811; he gained a knowledge of architecture which was very remarkable at a time when little taste existed for the beauties of the Gothic styles. In 1811 alone he is said to have studied three thousand ecclesiastical buildings. In September that year he gave the first of a series of lectures on medieval architecture at the small Philosophical Society of Liverpool, which he had joined. In around 1812 he wrote an essay on Chester Cathedral, which was published posthumously in 1864.

The first publication to appear during his lifetime was an article on Gothic architecture for &quot;Smith&#x27;s Panorama of Arts and Sciences&quot; (Liverpool). This was separately published in 1817 as &quot;An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation&quot;, the first systematic treatise on Gothic architecture and a milestone in the Gothic Revival. It ran through many editions and provided the basis of Rickman&#x27;s public reputation. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829.
==Rickman&#x27;s architectural practice==

As an architect, Rickman was self-taught. In 1812 he met John Cragg an ironmaster based in Liverpool, and they collaborated on the design of three churches that made extensive use of cast iron: St. George&#x27;s Church, Everton; St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Aigburth; and St Philip&#x27;s Church (since demolished) in Hardman Street.

When in the Church Building Act 1818 a large grant of money was set by the government to build new &quot;Waterloo churches&quot;, Rickman sent in a design of his own which was successful in an open competition; thus he was fairly launched upon the profession of an architect, for which his natural gifts strongly fitted him. Rickman then moved to Birmingham where he designed the St George&#x27;s Church (demolished in 1960) for the city. The design also consisted of churchyard gates, completed in 1822, which remain today. By 1830 Rickman had become one of the most successful architects of his time. He built churches at Hampton Lucy, Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George&#x27;s at Birmingham, St Philip&#x27;s, St Mary the Virgin and St Matthew&#x27;s in Bristol, two in Carlisle, St Peter&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s at Preston, St David&#x27;s in Glasgow, Grey Friars at Coventry, St Michael&#x27;s Church, Aigburth and many others. He also designed New Court of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a palace for the bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses.

Rickman attracted a large share of the Church Building Commission&#x27;s patronage in the new churches built in the West Midlands pursuant to the Church Building Act of 1818. Rickman&#x27;s transitional Gothic style, that later designers looked down on as &quot;Church Commissioners&#x27; Gothic&quot;, did not stand the more rigorous scrutiny of better-informed historicists in the age of photography. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;[his churches] are all in the Gothic style, but show more knowledge of the outward form of the medieval style than any real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better than dull copies of old work, disfigured by much poverty of detail.&quot; A later, more generous critic, Sir Howard Colvin, has remarked &quot;He was no ecclesiologist. If the detailing of his buildings was unusually scholarly, the planning remained Georgian, and the total effect of most of his churches is thin and brittle, if by no means unattractive.&quot; Rickman nevertheless played an important part in the revival of taste for medievalism, perhaps second only to Pugin.

Henry Hutchinson partnered with Rickman in December 1821 and formed a practice called Rickman and Hutchinson. Rickman remained in this practice until Hutchinson&#x27;s death in 1831.

==Personal life==
Rickman was married three times: first to his cousin, Lucy Rickman of Lewes; secondly to Christiana Hornor; and thirdly to Elizabeth Miller of Edinburgh, by whom he had a son, the architect Thomas Miller Rickman (1827–1912), and a daughter. He was a Quaker for most of his life. Though officially estranged after his first marriage, he continued to attend meetings, and was re-admitted prior to his second marriage. Late in his life, he became a member of the Catholic Apostolic (Irvingian) Church

==Death and burial==

Rickman died at Birmingham on 4 January 1841. He was buried in the churchyard of the church he had designed: St George&#x27;s Church. His tomb, designed by R. C. Hussey and completed in 1845, still stands, although the church does not.

<text>Mimic is a 1997 American science fiction horror film directed by Guillermo del Toro, written by del Toro and Matthew Robbins, and based on Donald A. Wollheim&#x27;s short story of the same name. The film stars Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin, F. Murray Abraham, and Charles S. Dutton. Its plot follows the creation of a genetically modified insect, designed to battle an infected cockroach infestation, that rapidly evolves and begins attacking humans.

Produced by Dimension Films and distributed by Miramax Films, &quot;Mimic&quot; premiered at the Fantafestival in June 1997, and released theatrically on August 22. It received middling reviews from critics, and only grossed $22.5 million on a budget of $30 million. Additionally, del Toro disowned the theatrical cut, stemming from clashes over creative differences with Dimension/Miramax heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein, later releasing a director&#x27;s cut on Blu-ray in 2011. Two direct-to-video sequels followed, &quot;Mimic 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;Mimic 3: Sentinel&quot; (2003)

==Plot==
In New York City, cockroaches are spreading the &quot;Strickler&#x27;s disease&quot; that is killing hundreds of the city&#x27;s children. Unable to develop a cure for the disease, Dr. Peter Mann, deputy director of the CDC, recruits entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler. Dr. Tyler uses genetic engineering to create the &quot;Judas breed&quot;, a hybrid between a mantis and a termite that releases an enzyme which accelerates the roaches&#x27; metabolism. This way, the roaches burn calories faster than they can nourish themselves and thus starve to death. The roaches carrying the disease are eradicated, and Peter and Susan later marry.

Three years later, a priest is chased and dragged underground by an assailant. The only witness is Chuy, a boy who refers to the attacker as &quot;Mr. Funny Shoes&quot; to his disbelieving guardian, an immigrant subway shoe shiner named Manny. Later, two kids sell a &quot;weird bug&quot; from the subway to Susan, which she performs tests on, and realizes it is similar to the Judas breed. Initially, she believes that this is impossible since the specimens she released were all female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, which should have ensured that the breed would die off after a single generation. Before she can examine the insect further it is stolen by a figure who escapes out the window. After informing the police, she consults with her mentor, Dr. Gates, who autopsies a larger specimen found in the city&#x27;s sewage treatment plants, and finds that its organs are fully formed, meaning the Judas breed is not only alive but has developed into a viable species, with a colony underneath the city.

Looking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find an egg sac and are then killed by the same assailant. Meanwhile, Chuy enters the abandoned church of the dead priest to find &quot;Mr. Funny Shoes&quot; and is abducted. Peter, his assistant Josh Maslow and MTA officer Leonard Norton enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate. However, Peter and Leonard get stuck and send Josh for help. Susan encounters a shadowy creature in a trench coat on a train platform. She approaches the figure, which unfolds into an insect the size of a human being. The creature abducts Susan and carries her into the tunnels. Meanwhile, Josh finds a way out but is found by a Judas and killed. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, and they barricade themselves inside a train car.

Susan surmises that the Judas breed&#x27;s accelerated metabolism has allowed them to reproduce at an accelerated rate, causing them to evolve over tens of thousands of generations within only three years, developing lungs, allowing increased size, and the ability to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: using the remains of a dead bug to mask their scent as they work, Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels and overrun the city unless they manage to kill the colony&#x27;s single fertile male. While trying to reach the track switches, Manny finds Chuy who has survived due to his imitating the clicking noises the bugs use for communication. However, before they can escape Manny is killed by the male Judas. Susan, realizing Manny has been gone too long, goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard&#x27;s injured leg starts bleeding heavily and knowing the smell will incite the creatures and endanger the group, he creates a diversion that allows the others to get away, before being killed. Peter finds a dumbwaiter and puts Susan and Chuy in it, but stays behind to destroy the breed for good. He is chased into a room where hundreds are nesting and blows them all up by setting fire to a loose gas pipe, before diving underwater to safety.

The male Judas escapes the blast and goes after Chuy but is distracted by Susan, who lures it into the path of an oncoming train, which runs over it. The two make it to the surface, with Susan assuming that Peter had died in the blast. She then sees what appears to be another Judas, only for it to be revealed to actually be Peter alive and well. The three then reunite and embrace one another.

== Production ==
===Casting===
The character of Manny was originally written by Guillermo del Toro for one of his favorite actors, Argentinian Federico Luppi, whom he directed in &quot;Cronos&quot; (1993). However, Luppi&#x27;s English pronunciation was not good enough for the film, so del Toro chose Giancarlo Giannini instead; in a 2013 interview del Toro confirmed the story and stated that what he misses the most about working in the Spanish language is the possibility of directing Luppi, for whom del Toro professes the utmost admiration.

Two of the film&#x27;s actors, Josh Brolin and Alix Koromzay, had previously starred in &quot;Nightwatch&quot;, another Dimension/Miramax horror film from 1997. Its director, Ole Bornedal, served as a producer on &quot;Mimic&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography occurred in Toronto, Canada, due to the city&#x27;s similarities to New York. The film includes several examples of del Toro&#x27;s most characteristic hallmarks: &quot;I have a sort of a fetish for insects, clockwork, monsters, dark places, and unborn things&quot;, said del Toro, and this is evident in &quot;Mimic&quot;, where at times all are combined in long, brooding shots of dark, cluttered, muddy chaotic spaces. According to Alfonso Cuarón, del Toro&#x27;s friend and colleague, &quot;with Guillermo the shots are almost mathematical — everything is planned&quot;.

Miramax and Dimension Films bosses Bob and Harvey Weinstein repeatedly clashed with del Toro over creative differences. After Harvey saw early footage, there were fights between him and del Toro regarding the tone, with the former claiming the film was not scary enough. It has been reported that one day Harvey was so infuriated with del Toro that he stormed onto the Toronto set and attempted to instruct del Toro on &quot;how to direct a movie&quot;, and later tried to get him fired. Following an intervention from lead actress Mira Sorvino, Weinstein backed down, and principal photography would be completed with del Toro as director in early 1997. Producer B.J. Rack later compared making the film to &quot;being a prisoner of [a] war camp&quot;, while del Toro stated in 2018: &quot;The only time I have experienced bad behaviour, and it remains one of the worst experiences of my life, was in 1997, when I did &quot;Mimic&quot; for Miramax. It was a horrible, horrible, horrible experience&quot;.

==Release==

=== Director&#x27;s cut ===
The Weinsteins insisted on having control over the final cut, thus del Toro was not granted final cut privilege and later disowned the theatrical cut, but states that &quot;&quot;Mimic&quot; is visually 100% exactly what I wanted...The movie is visually gorgeous and it has a couple of sequences I’m very proud of.&quot;. In 2010, del Toro revealed that he had been working on a director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Mimic&quot; and said: &quot;It’s not exactly the movie I wanted to do, but it definitely healed a lot of wounds... I am happy with the cut&quot;. The director&#x27;s cut runs for 112 minutes, six minutes longer than the theatrical release. It was released in 2011, initially exclusive to Blu-ray and is now available via various digital services, but has never been widely available on DVD.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Box Office Mojo, its domestic gross is $25,480,490; it did not recoup its budget of $30,000,000.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying &quot;Del Toro is a director with a genuine visual sense, with a way of drawing us into his story and evoking the mood with the very look and texture of his shots. He takes the standard ingredients and presents them so effectively that &quot;Mimic&quot; makes the old seem new, fresh and scary&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Legacy==
&quot;Mimic&quot; was planned as one of three 30-minute short films intended to be shown together. It was expanded into a full-length movie, as was &quot;Impostor&quot; (2001). The short film &quot;Alien Love Triangle&quot; remains a 30-minute short film, but has never been released publicly.

Two sequels followed, &quot;Mimic 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;Mimic 3: Sentinel&quot; (2003), for direct-to-video release. Alix Koromzay reprises his role for the former, although neither feature the involvement of the original&#x27;s creative team.

Bong Joon-ho cited &quot;Mimic&quot; as an inspiration for his monster movie &quot;The Host&quot; (2006).

In 2020, a television adaptation/reboot was announced to be in development, with Paul W. S. Anderson directing the pilot. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt are executive producers, along with Jim Danger Gray who will also be showrunner of the series.

<doc id="1168528" wikidata="Q834926" url="?curid=1168528" title="Marcel Broodthaers">
<text>Marcel Broodthaers (28 January 1924 – 28 January 1976) was a Belgian poet, filmmaker, and visual artist. 

==Early life==
Broodthaers was born on 28 January 1924 in Brussels, Belgium.

==Career==
Broodthaers was associated with the Groupe Surréaliste-revolutionnaire from 1945.
===Art===
After spending 20 years in poverty as a struggling poet, at the end of 1963 he decided to become an artist and began to make objects. He performed the symbolic act of embedding fifty unsold copies of his book of poems &quot;Pense-Bête&quot; in plaster, creating his first art object. That same year, 1964, for his first exhibition, he wrote an infamous introduction that was printed onto pages cut from magazines that doubled as the exhibition&#x27;s public announcement:

&quot;I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed in life. For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty years old... Finally the idea of inventing something insincere crossed my mind and I set to work straightaway. At the end of three months I showed what I had produced to Philippe Edouard Toussaint, the owner of the Galerie St Laurent. &#x27;But it is art&#x27; he said &#x27;and I will willingly exhibit all of it.&#x27; &#x27;Agreed&#x27; I replied. If I sell something, he takes 30%. It seems these are the usual conditions, some galleries take 75%.

What is it? In fact it is objects.&quot;
Broodthaers later worked principally with assemblies of found objects and collage, often containing written texts. He incorporated written language in his art and used whatever was at hand for his raw materials—most notably the shells of eggs and mussels, but also furniture, clothing, garden tools, household gadgets and reproductions of artworks. In his &quot;Visual Tower&quot; (1966), Broodthaers made a seven-story circular tower of wood. He filled each story with uniform glass jars, and in every jar he placed an identical image taken from an illustrated magazine, of the eye of a beautiful young woman. For &quot;Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with bag))&quot; (1966), he glued mussels in resin on a square panel; in 1974 the artist added a discreet metal hook to the centre of the work designed to support a shopping bag filled with mussel shells.

From 1968 to 1975 Broodthaers produced large-scale environmental pieces that reworked the very notion of the museum. His most noted work was an installation which began in his Brussels house which he called &quot;Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles&quot; (1968), containing different representations of eagles in glass cases that were accompanied by signs that asserted &quot;This is not a work of art&quot;, implying that museums obscure the ideological functioning of images by imposing illegitimate classifications of value. This installation was followed by a further eleven manifestations of the &#x27;museum&#x27;, including at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf for an exhibition in 1970 and at documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972. In 1970 Broodthaers conceived of the &quot;Financial Section&quot;, which encompassed an attempt to sell the museum &quot;on account of bankruptcy.&quot; The sale was announced on the cover of the Art Cologne fair catalogue in 1971, but no buyers were found. As part of the &quot;Financial Section&quot;, the artist also produced an unlimited edition of gold ingots stamped with the museum&#x27;s emblem, an eagle, a symbol associated with power and victory. The ingots were sold to raise money for the museum, at a price calculated by doubling the market value of gold, the surcharge representing the bar&#x27;s value as art. 

In 1974, Broodthaers launched three separate exhibitions in the same week, each consisting of a new type of installation artwork he referred to as &quot;décors&quot;. The venues of these exhibitions were Wide White Space in Antwerp, Catalogue-Catalogus at Palais de Beaux-Arts Brussels, and Eloge du sujet at Kunstmuseum Basel. In 1975 Broodthaers presented the exhibition &quot;L’Angelus de Daumier&quot; at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Paris, at which each room had the name of a colour. In &quot;La Salle Blanche (The White Room)&quot; (1975), a life-size copy of a room and a half in Broodthaers&#x27; home in Brussels, the wooden walls of the empty, unfurnished rooms are covered with printed words in French—such as museum, gallery, oil, subject, composition, images, and privilege—all intended to examine &quot;the influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art.&quot; For such works he is associated with the late 20th century global spread of both installation art as well as &quot;institutional critique,&quot; in which interrelationships between artworks, the artist, and the museum are a focus. Indeed, Broodthaers&#x27; &quot;Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne&quot;, his &quot;first fictional museum,&quot; allowed him to simultaneously posture as artist, director, curator and trustee in a self-reflexive examination of the order and prescriptions implicit in the production of museum exhibits. In 2019, The New York Times cited &quot;Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles&quot; as one of the 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age.

===Films===
Broodthaers made his first film in 1957, and from 1967 he produced over 50 short films in documentary, narrative, and experimental styles. He collaborated with Belgian director Jean Harlez, who also worked as cameraman on around a dozen of his films over a period of many years.

===Publishing===
As a poet and political activist, Broodthaers had a life-long interest in the circulatory power of printed matter: posters, graphics, editions, and artist books. In addition to the prospect of commercial galleries selling limited editions, the artist&#x27;s books Broodthaers published with institutions like Kunstalle Düsseldorf, the Deutsche Academischer Austaudienst (DAAD), Berlin, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, merged his profit ambitions with his nonprofit conceptual and philosophical ideas. For example, Broodthaers&#x27; catalogue for &quot;Der Adler von Oligizän bis heute,&quot; the seminal culmination of his &quot;Musee d&#x27;Art Moderne, department des Aigles,&quot; at Kunstalle Düsseldorf in 1972, was published in two volumes. Volume I featured a scholarly index of the items on display and was for sale at the opening of the exhibition, replete with a coupon that could be redeemed later for Volume II, which featured views of the installation and came out at the close of the exhibition.

Broodthaers returned to this motif for his artist&#x27;s book &quot;Photographieren Verboten/No Photographs Allowed&quot; but aimed it at the convention of the exhibition catalogue, with version one published by the DAAD, Berlin, and version two by the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The Oxford book presents ostensibly the same content as the DAAD book but scrambles the internal logic of the book, changing the context of its standard component parts—title page, checklist, scholarly essay, curriculum vitae—and thus the implications of each. Content normally reserved for the rear of an exhibition catalogue (in this case the artist&#x27;s cv) appears on the inside front cover as a decorative pattern, and scholarly content such as the catalogue essay appears on the outside back cover like an advertising blurb.

==Later life and death==
From late 1969, Broodthaers lived mainly in Düsseldorf, Berlin, and finally London. 

He died on 28 January 1976 in Cologne, Germany, of a liver disease, on his 52nd birthday. He is buried at Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels under a tombstone of his own design which was realized by sculptor Karel Van Roy in Beernem, Belgium.

==Exhibitions==
In 1980, the exhibition &quot;Marcel Broodthaers&quot; was mounted by the Tate Gallery, London. Other important retrospectives of Broodthaers&#x27; work have been held at the Walker Art Center (1989), Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1989); Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (1989); Jeu de Paume, Paris (1991); and Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels (2000), The Fridericianum, Kassel, Germany (2015), and Muhka, Antwerp (2019). The most recent traveling survey was organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid in 2016, which travelled to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf in 2017. An important solo exhibition of the film work, &quot;Marcel Broodthaers: Cinéma&quot;, was shown at Fundacio Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona; Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and Kunsthalle Düsseldorf in (1997). 

There have been many notable international group exhibitions, including documenta 5, 7 and 10, Kassel (1972, 1982, and 1997). Notable recent group shows include &quot;The Artist as Poet: Selections from Pamm&#x27;s Collection,&quot; in 2021-2022, at Pérez Art Museum Miami.

<text>The 9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment &quot;Col Moschin&quot; () is a Special Forces unit of the Italian Army based in Livorno in Tuscany. The regiment is part of the Italian Army&#x27;s infantry arm&#x27;s Paracadutisti speciality and assigned to the Army Special Forces Command for training, preparation, doctrinal and procedural development, and the materiel acquisition. Operationally the regiment falls under the Italian Armed Forces&#x27; Joint Special Forces Operations Command. The regiment is the only military unit which has participated in all out-of-area missions of the Italian Army since World War II. The regiment is also the only Italian Army unit to have been awarded the Military Order of Italy thrice.

During World War I the Royal Italian Army formed assault units manned by Arditi troops to storm enemy trenches in close combat. One of these units was the IX Assault Unit, which distinguished itself during the Second Battle of the Piave River by retaking the summit of Col Moschin, and during the preparations for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto by taking the summit of Col della Beretta. For these actions the IX Assault Unit was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor and, together with all other Royal Italian Army infantry units, a Military Order of Italy. After the war the IX Assault Unit was disbanded. In 1942, during World War II, the Royal Italian Army formed the 10th Arditi Regiment, whose personnel operated behind allies lines in North Africa. In September 1943, after the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile the regiment&#x27;s I Arditi Battalion, which was based in Sardinia and undertook reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and sabotage missions in allied held Algeria and Tunisia, joined the Italian Co-belligerent Army. In March 1944, the I Arditi Battalion was renamed IX Assault Unit and one month later, in April 1944, the unit entered the front on the allied side. The IX Assault Unit fought in Italian campaign and was awarded two Silver Medals of Military Valor for its conduct during the campaign. After the war the IX Assault Unit was disbanded.

In 1953, the Italian Army formed a Paratroopers Saboteurs Company, which in 1954 was expanded to Paratroopers Saboteurs Unit. In 1961, the unit was renamed Paratroopers Saboteurs Battalion. In 1963, the battalion was assigned to the Paratroopers Brigade, which in 1967 was renamed Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot;. In 1975, the battalion was renamed 9th Paratroopers Assault Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot; and assigned the flag and traditions of the 10th Arditi Regiment and the traditions of the IX Assault Unit. In 1995, the battalion lost its autonomy and entered the newly formed 9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment &quot;Col Moschin&quot;. In 2014, the regiment was transferred from the Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot; to the newly formed Army Special Forces Command. The regiment&#x27;s anniversary falls on 16 June 1918, the day the IX Assault Unit retook the Italian positions on the summit of the Col Moschin, which had been lost the day before.

== History ==
=== World War I ===
In November 1916, during World War I, the Royal Italian Army began to experiment with dedicated assault troops modeled after the Imperial German Army&#x27;s Stormtroopers. In spring 1917, the first assault units were formed with volunteer personnel. On 27 July 1917, King Victor Emmanuel III sanctioned the formation of the Arditi corps and the corps&#x27; assault units. Each assault unit fielded 753 Arditi and had the following organization:
* Assault Unit
** Command Squad (10× Arditi)
** 3× Assault companies (226× Arditi per company)
*** Command Squad (10× Arditi)
*** 4× Assault platoons (44× Arditi)
**** Assault Squad (12× Arditi with a dagger and 20× hand grenades)
**** Attack Squad (10× Arditi with a dagger, 4× hand grenades, and a Carcano carbine with 72 rounds)
**** 2× Attack squads (8× Arditi with a dagger, 4× hand grenades, and a Carcano carbine with 72 rounds; 2× Arditi with a Villar Perosa submachine guns with 500 rounds)
**** Ammunition Team (2× Arditi carrying 150× hand grenades)
*** Specialists Platoon (40× Arditi)
**** Machine Gunners Section (18× Arditi with 2× Fiat–Revelli Mod. 1914 machine guns with 20,000 rounds per gun)
**** Sappers Section (12× Arditi)
**** Signalers Section (10× Arditi)
** Support Company
*** Canonniers Section (37× Canonniers with 2× 65/17 infantry support guns)
*** Machine Gunners Section (18× Arditi with 2× Fiat–Revelli Mod. 1914 machine guns with 20,000 rounds per gun)
*** Replacements Squad (10× Arditi)
On 18 and 19 August 1917, three assault units fought in the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo and successfully cleared trenches manned by Austro-Hungarian Army troops. After the disastrous Battle of Caporetto the Royal Italian Army added a flamethrower section to each assault company. The Arditi also received a standardized uniform, which included black gorget patches and a black Fez with a black tassel. In spring 1917, each Italian army corps received an assault unit, among them the IX Assault Unit (), which was formed in May 1918, by the regimental depot of the 45th Infantry Regiment (Brigade &quot;Reggio&quot;) in Sassari for the IX Army Corps.

On 15 June 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Army began the Second Battle of the Piave River along the Piave river and on the Monte Grappa massif. In the latter sector the Austro-Hungarian forces managed to occupy part of the Italian first line during the first day of the battle. On 16 June, the IX Assault Unit was ordered to retake the Italian positions on the summit of Col Moschin, which had been lost the day before on. The IX Assault Unit retook the position in a lightning attack and held the summit until Italian infantry could be brought up.

On 20 October 1918, in preparation of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the IX Assault Unit attacked and conquered the summit of Col della Beretta in the Monte Grappa sector, but suffered heavy casualties in the attack. For its conduct on 15 June and 20 October 1918 the IX Assault Unit was awarded Italy&#x27;s second-highest military honor the Silver Medal of Military Valor. By the end of the war 39 assault units had been formed: twelve assigned to the army&#x27;s two assault divisions, 14 assigned to the Italian field armies, two deployed to the Western Front, one deployed to the Macedonian front, one deployed to the Albanian Front, and nine as replacement units. After the war all Arditi units were disbanded.

=== World War II ===
==== 10th Arditi Regiment ====
On 15 May 1942, the depot of the 82nd Infantry Regiment &quot;Torino&quot; in Bracciano formed the I Arditi Battalion. The battalion consisted of the 101st Paratroopers Company, 102nd Swimmers Company (later renamed: 102nd Landing Company), and 103rd Trucks Company (later renamed: 103rd Terrestrial Company). Each company consisted of ten patrols of two officers and ten men each. Advanced training for the paratroopers occurred at the Royal Italian Air Force&#x27;s Paratroopers School Tarquinia, while advanced training for the swimmers occurred at the Royal Italian Navy&#x27;s Divers School in Livorno and at the naval base in Pula. The personnel of the trucks company was trained to take fixed positions or heavily guarded locations. All members of the battalion were also trained in the use of explosives at the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s Sappers School in Civitavecchia.

On 20 July 1942, the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s General Staff ordered to form an Arditi Regiment, which would consist of a command, regimental services, and at least two Arditi battalions. The regiment was based in Santa Severa and on 1 August the I Arditi Battalion joined the newly formed regiment. The regiment was under direct control of the General Staff&#x27;s Operations Office.

On 20 August 1942, the II Arditi Battalion was formed, which consisted of the 111th Paratroopers Company, 112th Swimmers Company (later renamed: 112th Landing Company), and 113th Terrestrial Company. On 15 September 1942, the Arditi Regiment was renamed 10th Arditi Regiment. In January 1943, the I Arditi Battalion with the 101st Paratroopers Company and 102nd Landing Company was transferred to Cagliari in Sardinia, from where the battalion conducted operations behind allied lines in Algeria and Tunisia. Before the battalion left mainland Italy for Sardinia both companies detached two patrols, which were sent to the island of Rhodes and intended to operate against British forces in Cyprus. Between 19 and 23 February 1943, the 103rd Terrestrial Company was transferred to Tunisia, where the company&#x27;s patrols operated behind enemy lines on reconnaissance and intelligence gathering missions during the Tunisian campaign.

On 1 March 1943, the formation of the III Arditi Battalion concluded. The battalion consisted of the 121st Paratroopers Company, 122nd Landing Company, and 123rd Terrestrial Company. In April 1943, the two patrols of the 101st Paratroopers Company returned from Rhodes without having undertaken any missions. On 4 May 1943, the 113th Terrestrial Company was transferred to Scordia in Sicily, from where it was intended to operate against allied targets in Tunisia. On 13 May 1943, the remaining Axis forces in Tunisia surrendered, including the 103rd Terrestrial Company. One week later, on 20 May 1943, the II Arditi Battalion and the 112th Landing Company were transferred to Sicily, while on 29 May the 123rd Terrestrial Company was transferred to Sardinia and assigned to the I Arditi Battalion as replacement for the lost 103rd Terrestrial Company.

On 10 June 1943, the 10th Arditi Regiment was reorganized and three special companies were formed, which consisted of personnel capable of operating behind enemy lines in civilian clothes. Afterwards the regiment consisted now of the following units:
* 10th Arditi Regiment, in Santa Severa
** I Arditi Battalion, in Cagliari (Sardinia)
*** 102nd Landing Company, 123rd Terrestrial Company, 110th Special Company
** II Arditi Battalion, in Scordia (Sicily)
*** 112th Landing Company, 113th Terrestrial Company, 120th Special Company
** III Arditi Battalion, in Santa Severa
*** 122nd Landing Company, 133rd Terrestrial Company, 130th Special Company
** IV Arditi Battalion, in Santa Severa
*** 101st Paratroopers Company, 111th Paratroopers Company, and 121st Paratroopers Company
** Services Platoon
As part of the reorganization the formation of a fifth Arditi battalion began. On 19 June 1943, the remaining personnel returned from Rhodes.

==== Operations ====
The first operation of the regiment occurred during the night of 16 to 17 January 1943, when a patrol of the 101st Paratroopers Company parachuted into Algeria on an intelligence gathering mission. In the night of 16 to 17 February 1943, a patrol of the same company blew up the railway bridge at Béni Mansour on the Béni Mansour-Bejaïa line. From January to July 1943 the regiment undertook twenty air or sea assaults against railway bridges, airfields, and other objects in Algeria, Tunisia, or Libya.

On 10 July 1943, allied forces landed on Sicily. Initially the II Arditi Battalion was tasked with rounding up dispersed allied paratroopers, but on 14 July the battalion was moved to the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto river to the South of Catania, where in the night of 14–15 July the battalion defeated a British attempt to take the bridge in a surprise attack during Operation Fustian. In the evening of 30 July 1943, the 4th Patrol of the 112th Landing Company embarked at Giardini Naxos on three assault boats of the Royal Italian Navy. The ten Arditi landed behind allied lines at Brucoli from where the patrol hiked inland. After hiding during the day the patrol attacked an allied fuel and ammunition depot after nightfall. Afterwards the patrol moved on foot to the front line along the Simeto river and reached the Italian lines by swimming around the English positions at the mouth of the Simeto river. On 13 August 1943, the II Aridit Battalion was evacuated across the Strait of Messina and returned to Santa Severa.

In the evening of 8 September 1943, the Armistice of Cassibile, which ended hostilities between the Kingdom of Italy and the Anglo-American Allies, was announced by General Dwight D. Eisenhower on Radio Algiers and by Marshal Pietro Badoglio on Italian radio. Germany reacted by invading Italy and the 10th Arditi Regiment split: the 111th Paratroopers Company and 122nd Landing Company fought against the invading Germans, which tried to occupy Rome, while the rest of the regiment remained in its barracks. After occupying Rome the Germans disbanded the regiment and most of its companies, while the 112th Landing Company and 121st Paratroopers Company joined the Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Republican Army.

==== IX Assault Unit ====
After the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile, the I Arditi Battalion in Sardinia refused German demands to surrender and, on 12 September 1943, the battalion defeated a German attempt to disarm it. Soon afterwards the German forces retreated from Sardinia. The I Arditi Battalion remained on the island until February 1944, when it was shipped to Naples, where it arrived on 19 February. On 20 March 1944, the I Arditi Battalion was renamed IX Assault Unit and assigned to the Italian Co-belligerent Army&#x27;s I Motorized Grouping. The I Motorized Grouping fought on the allied side in the Italian campaign. On 18 April 1944, the I Motorized Grouping entered the Italian Liberation Corps, which was assigned to the II Polish Corps for the Battle of Ancona. On 27 June 1944, the IX Assault Unit was reinforced by the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron &quot;Cavalleggeri Guide&quot;. By 25 July 1944, the IX Assault Unit had fought at Colli a Volturno, Guardiagrele, Cingoli, and along the Musone and Esino rivers, and in the Battle of Ancona, where the unit achieved the decisive breakthrough of the German line at Casenuove. For its conduct in these battles the IX Assault Unit was awarded a second Silver Medal of Military Valor.

On 24 September 1944, the IX Assault Unit entered the 68th Infantry Regiment &quot;Legnano&quot; as III Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot;. The battalion was equipped with British weapons and materiel and consisted of approximately 400 men divided into a command company, three assault companies, and a support weapons company. The 68th Infantry Regiment &quot;Legnano&quot; was assigned to the Combat Group &quot;Legnano&quot;, which entered the front on 23 March 1945 as part of the IV US Corps on the river Idice. The Combat Group &quot;Legnano&quot; fought in the allied Spring Offensive and took part in the Battle of Bologna. For its conduct in these battles the III Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot; was awarded the unit&#x27;s third Silver Medal of Military Valor.

On 1 August 1946, the III Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot; was disbanded and its personnel used to form the III Fusiliers Battalion of the 68th Infantry Regiment &quot;Legnano&quot;.

=== Cold War ===
On 20 April 1953, the Italian Army&#x27;s Infantry School in Cesano formed a Paratroopers Saboteurs Company. On 1 June 1954, the company was expanded to Paratroopers Saboteurs Unit. On 10 May 1957, the unit moved from Cesano to Pisa, where it was assigned to the army&#x27;s Military Parachuting Center. On 25 September 1961, the unit was renamed Paratroopers Saboteurs Battalion. On 1 January 1963, the Military Parachuting Center was reorganized as Paratroopers Brigade, which, on 10 June 1967, was renamed Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot;.

During the 1975 army reform the Italian Army disbanded the regimental level and newly independent battalions were granted for the first time their own flags. On 1 October 1975, the Paratroopers Saboteurs Battalion was renamed 9th Paratroopers Assault Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot;. The battalion was assigned to the Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot; and consisted of the following units:
* 9th Paratroopers Assault Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot;, in Pisa
** Command and Services Company
*** Command and Services Platoon
*** Amphibious Platoon
*** Transport Platoon
** Assault Company (Recruits Training)
*** Command and Services Platoon
*** 2× Recruits platoons
** 2× Assault companies
*** 6× Operational detachments per company
At the time the battalion fielded 340 men (36 officers, 196 non-commissioned officers, and 108 soldiers). On 12 November 1976, the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone assigned with decree 846 the flag and traditions of the 10th Arditi Regiment and the traditions of the IX Assault Unit to the battalion. The three Silver Medals of Military Valor, which had been awarded to the IX Assault Unit in World War I respectively in World War II, were affixed to the battalion&#x27;s flag and added to its coat of arms.

From September 1982 to November 1983, personnel of the battalion formed, together with personnel drawn from the 1st Carabinieri Paratroopers Battalion &quot;Tuscania&quot; and 2nd Paratroopers Battalion &quot;Tarquinia&quot;, a provisional battalion, which deployed with the Italian contingent to Lebanon in support of the Multinational Force in Lebanon.

=== Recent times ===
From May to October 1991, the battalion&#x27;s 2nd and 3rd companies and two companies of the 5th Paratroopers Battalion &quot;El Alamein&quot; formed a paratroopers tactical group, which deployed to northern Iraq for the American-led Operation Provide Comfort. From 22 December 1992 to 7 September 1993, personnel of the battalion was deployed to Somalia for the American-led Unified Task Force. For the conduct of its personnel in Somalia the battalion was awarded a Gold Medal of Army Valor, which was affixed to the battalion&#x27;s flag and added to its coat of arms.

On 25 October 1994, the battalion was awarded a Military Order of Italy for the many missions it had undertaken since being reformed. The order was affixed to the battalion&#x27;s flag. On 24 June 1995, the 9th Paratroopers Assault Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot; lost its autonomy and the next day the battalion entered the newly formed 9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment &quot;Col Moschin&quot; as 1st Raiders Battalion. On the same day, the flag and traditions of the 10th Arditi Regiment and the traditions of the IX Assault Unit were transferred from the battalion to the regiment. The regiment consisted of a command, a command and services company, the 1st Raiders Battalion, the 101st Paratroopers Assault Company, and the Raiders Training Base.

From 3 July 1996 to 24 March 1997, personnel of the regiment was deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina for the NATO-led Implementation Force and the following Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the conduct of its personnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina the regiment was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valor, which was affixed to the regiment&#x27;s flag and added to its coat of arms.

From July 2006 to October 2009, the regiment maintained a permanent presence in Kabul in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. During its time in Afghanistan the regiment&#x27;s personnel repeatedly battled Taliban forces. For its conduct in Afghanistan the regiment was awarded its third Military Order of Italy, which was affixed to the regiment&#x27;s flag.

On 19 September 2014, the regiment was transferred from the Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot; to the newly formed Army Special Forces Command. In 2022, the regiment moved from Pisa to its new base at Camp Darby near Livorno.

<text>William ( – 15 July 1406), known as William the Courteous (), a member of the House of Habsburg and Wilhelm, was Duke of Austria from 1386. As head of the Leopoldian line, he ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Carinthia, Styria and Carniola as well as the County of Tyrol and Further Austria from 1396 until his death.

== Biography ==
Born in Vienna, William was the oldest son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351–1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (1352–1414), a daughter of Lord Bernabò of Milan. Leopold III had already acted as regent over the Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions in Swabia; in 1379 he signed the Treaty of Neuberg with his elder brother Duke Albert III, whereupon he also received the Inner Austrian lands.

At the age of 8, William was betrothed to the Anjou princess Hedwig (&quot;Jadwiga&quot;; 1373–1399), the youngest daughter of King Louis I of Hungary, who had also become King of Poland in 1370. This was one of the first attempts of the Habsburgs to extend their dominions by marrying heiresses, as Louis intended his elder daughter Mary and her fiancé Sigismund of Luxembourg to succeed in Poland, while Jadwiga was designated heir to the Kingdom of Hungary. When King Louis died in 1382, Mary succeeded in Hungary. However, the Polish nobles rejected Mary and Sigismund, and instead chose Jadwiga as queen regnant. They also repudiated her betrothal to William and enforced the break-up of the engagement.
The Polish lords did not want to accept Jadwiga&#x27;s fourteen-year-old fiancé, William of Habsburg, as their sovereign. They thought that the inexperienced William and his Austrian kinsmen could not safeguard Poland&#x27;s interests against its powerful neighbours, especially the Luxemburgs which controlled Bohemia and Brandenburg, and had a strong claim on Hungary. According to Halecki, the lords of Lesser Poland were the first to suggest that Jadwiga should marry the pagan duke Jogaila of Lithuania.

Jogaila sent his envoysincluding his brother, Skirgaila, and a German burgher from Riga, Hanul to Kraków to request Jadwiga&#x27;s hand in January 1385. Jadwiga refused to answer, stating only that her mother would decide. Jogaila&#x27;s two envoys left for Hungary and met Queen Elizabeth. She informed them that &quot;she would allow whatever was advantageous to Poland and insisted that her daughter and the prelates and nobles of the Kingdom had to do what they considered would benefit Christianity and their kingdom&quot;, according to Jan Długosz&#x27;s chronicle. The nobles from Kraków, Sandomierz and Greater Poland assembled in Kraków in June or July and the &quot;majority of the more sensible&quot; voted for the acceptance of Jogaila&#x27;s marriage proposal.
In the meantime, William&#x27;s father, Leopold III hurried to Buda in late July 1385, demanding the consummation of the marriage between William and Jadwiga before 16 August. Queen Elizabeth confirmed the previous agreements about the marriage, ordering Vladislaus II of Opole to make preparations for the ceremony. According to canon law, Jadwiga&#x27;s marriage sacrament could only be completed before her twelfth birthday if the competent prelate testified her precocious maturity. Demetrius, Archbishop of Esztergom, issued the necessary document. William went to Kraków in the first half of August, but his entry to Wawel Castle was barred. Długosz states that Jadwiga and William would only be able to meet in the nearby Franciscan convent.

Contemporary or nearly contemporaneous records of the completion of the marriage between William and Jadwiga are contradictory and unclear. The official accounts of the municipal authorities of Kraków record that on 23 August 1385 an amnesty was granted to the prisoners in the city jail on the occasion of the celebration of the Queen&#x27;s marriage. On the other hand, a contemporary Austrian chronicle, the &quot;Continuatio Claustroneubuzgis&quot; states that the Poles had tried to murder William before he consummated the marriage. In the next century, Długosz states that William was &quot;removed in a shameful and offensive manner and driven from the castle&quot; after he entered &quot;the Queen&#x27;s bedchamber&quot;; but the same chronicler also mentions that Jadwiga was well aware that &quot;many people knew she had for a fortnight shared her bed with Duke William and that there had been physical consummation&quot;.

On the night when William entered the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, a group of Polish noblemen broke into the castle, forcing William to flee, according to Długosz. After this humiliation, Długosz continues, Jadwiga decided to leave Wawel and join William, but the gate of the castle was locked. She called for &quot;an axe and [tried] to break it open&quot;, but Dymitr of Goraj convinced her to return to the castle. Oscar Halecki says that Długosz&#x27;s narrative &quot;cannot be dismissed as a romantic legend&quot;; Robert I. Frost writes that it is a &quot;tale, almost certainly apocryphal&quot;. There is no doubt, however, that William of Austria was forced to leave Poland.

In 1386, Leopold III was killed in the Battle of Sempach. William and his brother Leopold IV succeeded him as Duke of Austria, ruling jointly with their uncle Albert III. A fierce inheritance dispute arose when Duke Albert III died in 1395 and was succeeded by his only son Albert IV, William&#x27;s first cousin. An agreement was reached in the following year, based on the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, whereupon William left the rule over Austria proper to Albert IV and, as eldest members of the Habsburg Leopoldian line, went on to rule over the three Inner Austrian duchies and the County of Tyrol taking his residence in Graz.

In 1401, William married another presumptive heiress, Princess Joanna of Durazzo, Hedwig&#x27;s cousin and also of Angevin descent. The marriage did not produce any offspring and William did not live to see his wife succeed her brother Ladislaus of Naples as Queen Joanna II in 1414.

In 1404, his cousin Albert IV died, leaving the lands of the elder Albertinian line to his seven-year-old son Duke Albert V. William acted as regent and again tried to take the Albertinian territories from his minor nephew, but did not succeed before his death.

William died in 1406 without heirs in Vienna. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in Vienna&#x27;s St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral. Upon his death, another division of the Habsburg hereditary lands took place, whereafter William&#x27;s brother Leopold IV took over the regency in Austria proper, the third-born Ernest the Iron inherited the Inner Austrian duchies, and Frederick IV, the youngest, Tyrol and Further Austria.

<text>Enoch Mankayi Sontonga ( – 18 April 1905) was a South African composer, who is best known for writing the Xhosa hymn &quot;&quot; (), which, in abbreviated version, has been sung as the first half of the national anthem of South Africa since 1994. Previously, it had been the official anthem of the African National Congress since 1925. It was also adopted by South Africa&#x27;s newly formed northern neighbour, Zimbabwe and translated into Shona, &quot;Ishe Komborera Afrika&quot; from 1980 until 1994.

==Early life and education==

Sontonga, a Xhosa, was born in the city of Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape Colony. He trained as a teacher at the Lovedale Institution and subsequently worked as a teacher and choirmaster at the Methodist Mission school in Nancefield, near Johannesburg for eight years.

==Career==
The first verse and chorus of &quot;&quot; was composed in 1897 and it was originally intended to be a school anthem. Some sources say he wrote the tune the same year. It was first sung in public in 1899 at the ordination of Reverend Mboweni, who was the first Tsonga Methodist minister. Later the Xhosa poet Samuel Mqhayi wrote a further seven verses.

Sontonga died on 18 April 1905. According to his death certificate, he died of gastro-enteritis and a perforated appendix which was a common cause of death at the time - the water was not very safe. 

==Personal life==
Sontonga married Diana Mgqibisa, the daughter of a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and they had a son. Mgqibisa died in 1939.

==Legacy==
The song started to be more well known after John Langalibalele Dube&#x27;s Ohlange Institute&#x27;s choir used it. They played it at the South African Native National Congress meeting in 1912. It was sung after the closing prayer and the ANC adopted it as its official closing anthem in 1925. It was recorded in London as &quot;Nkosi sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; in 1923 and it was published by the Lovedale Press in 1927.

For many years, the site of Sontonga&#x27;s grave was unknown, but it was finally located in the &quot; Christian&quot; section of the Braamfontein cemetery in the early-1990s. One of the reasons why the location of his grave remained a mystery is that it was listed under the name &quot;Enoch&quot; and not by his surname &quot;Sontonga&quot;.

On 24 September 1996, Sontonga&#x27;s grave was declared a national monument and a memorial on the site was unveiled by then-President Nelson Mandela. At the same ceremony, the South African Order of Meritorious Service (Gold) was bestowed on Enoch Sontonga posthumously.

<text>Carl Buchheister (17 October 1890 – 2 February 1964) was a German constructivist artist noted for his multiple series of &quot;model paintings&quot; at Galerie Lambert Weyl, Paris. which he began in 1925.

He was born in Hanover, Germany. Although he was not officially part of the Bauhaus movement, Buchheister was a close friend of Wassily Kandinsky and paralleled many of the social and artistic goals of the Bauhaus school. With regard to constructivism, Buchheister was typically more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries, becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass, aluminum, wood, and twine into his compositions. This direction was given much freer rein after World War II and the end of Nazism. He died in Hanover in 1964.

<doc id="1168570" wikidata="Q324509" url="?curid=1168570" title="Joint dislocation">
<text>A joint dislocation, also called luxation, occurs when there is an abnormal separation in the joint, where two or more bones meet. A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation. Dislocations are commonly caused by sudden trauma to the joint like during a car accident or fall. A joint dislocation can damage the surrounding ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dislocations can occur in any major joint (shoulder, knees, hips) or minor joint (toes, fingers). The most common joint dislocation is a shoulder dislocation.

The treatment for joint dislocation is usually by closed reduction, that is, skilled manipulation to return the bones to their normal position. Only trained medical professionals should perform reductions since the manipulation can cause injury to the surrounding soft tissue, nerves, or vascular structures.

==Signs and Symptoms==
The following symptoms are common with any type of dislocation.
* Intense pain
* Joint instability
* Deformity of the joint area
* Reduced muscle strength
* Bruising or redness of the joint area
* Difficulty moving joint
* Stiffness

=== Complications ===
Joint dislocations can have associated injuries to surrounding tissues and structures, including muscle strains, ligament and tendon injuries, neurovascular injuries, and fractures. Depending on the location of the dislocation, there are different complications to consider.

In the shoulder, vessel and nerve injuries are rare, but can cause many impairments and requires a longer recovery process. Knee dislocations are rare, but can be complicated by injuries to arteries and nerves, leading to limb-threatening complications. Degenerative changes following injury to the wrist are common, with many developing arthritis. Persistent nerve pain years after the initial trauma is not uncommon. Most finger dislocations occur in the middle of the finger (PIP) and are complicated by ligamentous injury (volar plate). Since most dislocations involving the joint near the fingertip (DIP joint) are due to trauma, there is often an associated fracture or tissue injury. Hip dislocations are at risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, femoral head fractures, the development of osteoarthritis, and sciatic nerve injury. Given the strength of ligaments in the foot and ankle, ankle dislocation-fractures can occur.

==Causes==

Joint dislocations are caused by trauma to the joint or when an individual falls on a specific joint. Great and sudden force applied, by either a blow or fall, to the joint can cause the bones in the joint to be displaced or dislocated from their normal position. With each dislocation, the ligaments keeping the bones fixed in the correct position can be damaged or loosened, making it easier for the joint to be dislocated in the future.

=== Risk Factors ===
A variety of risk factors can predispose individuals to joint dislocation. They can vary depending on location of the joint. Genetic factors and underlying medical conditions can further increase risk. Genetic conditions, such as hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome put individuals at increased risk for dislocations. Hypermobility syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects the ligaments around joints. The loosened or stretched ligaments in the joint provide less stability and allow for the joint to dislocate more easily. Dislocation can also occur because of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. In Rheumatoid arthritis the production of synovial fluid decreases, gradually causing pain, swollen joints, and stiffness. A forceful push causes friction and can dislocate the joint. Notably, joint instability in the neck is a potential complication of rheumatoid arthritis.

Participation in sports, being male, variations in the shape of the joint, being older, and joint hypermobility in males are risk factors associated with an increased risk of first time dislocation. Risk factors for &quot;recurrent&quot; dislocation include participation in sports, being a young male, a history of a previous dislocation with an associated injury, and any history of previous dislocation.

==Diagnosis==
Initial evaluation of a suspected joint dislocation begins with a thorough patient history, including mechanism of injury, and physical examination. Special attention should be focused on the neurovascular exam both before and after reduction, as injury to these structures may occur during the injury or during the reduction process. Imaging studies are frequently obtained to assist with diagnosis and to determine the extent of injury.
=== Imaging Types ===

==== X-ray, usually a minimum of 2-views ====
* Generally, pre- and post-reduction X-rays are taken. Initial X-ray can confirm the dislocation and evaluate for any fractures. Post-reduction x-rays confirm successful joint alignment and can identify any injuries that may have been caused during the reduction procedure.
* If initial X-rays are normal but additional injury is suspected, there may be a benefit of obtaining stress/weight-bearing views to look for injury to ligamentous structures and/or need for surgical intervention. One example is with AC joint separations.

==== Ultrasound ====
* Ultrasound may be useful in an acute setting, and is a bedside test that can be performed in the Emergency Department. Ultrasound accuracy is dependent on user ability and experience. Ultrasound is nearly as effective as x-ray in detecting shoulder dislocations. Ultrasound may also have utility in diagnosing AC joint dislocations.
* In infants &lt;6 months of age with suspected developmental dysplasia of the hip (congenital hip dislocation), ultrasound is the imaging study of choice. This is due to the lack of ossification at this age, which will not be apparent on x-rays.

==== Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) ====
* X-rays are generally sufficient in confirming a joint dislocation. However, additional imaging can be used to better define and evaluate abnormalities that may be missed or unclear on plain X-rays. CT and MRI are not routinely used for simple dislocation, however CT is useful in certain cases such as hip dislocation where an occult femoral neck fracture is suspected . CT angiogram may be used if vascular injury is suspected. In addition to improved visualization of bony abnormalities, MRI permits for a more detailed inspection of the joint-supporting structures in order to assess for ligamentous and other soft tissue injury.

=== Classification ===
Dislocations can either be full, referred to as luxation, or partial, referred to as subluxation. Simple dislocations are dislocations without an associated fracture, while complex dislocations have an associated fracture. Depending on the type of joint involved (i.e. ball-and-socket, hinge), the dislocation can further be classified by anatomical position, such as an anterior hip dislocation. Joint dislocations are named based on the distal component in relation to the proximal one.

== Prevention ==
Preventing joint dislocations can be difficult since most are caused by an unexpected injury. If participating in activities such as contact sports, where there is a risk for dislocation, wearing appropriate protective equipment can be helpful. Similarly, avoiding positions that place the joint in a vulnerable position can reduce the risk of experiencing a dislocation. Strengthening the muscles surrounding joints can effectively reduce the risk of a joint dislocation and recurrent dislocations.

==Treatment==

=== Non-operative ===

==== Reduction/Repositioning ====
X-rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and detect any associated fractures. A dislocation is easily seen on an X-ray. Once X-rays are taken, the joint is usually manipulated back into position. This can be a very painful process. This is typically done either in the emergency department under sedation or in an operating room under a general anaesthetic. A dislocated joint should be reduced into its normal position only by a trained medical professional. Trying to reduce a joint without any training could worsen the injury.

It is important to reduce the joint as soon as possible. Delaying reduction can compromise the blood supply to the joint. This is especially true in the case of a dislocated ankle, due to the anatomy of the blood supply to the foot. On field reduction is crucial for joint dislocations. As they are extremely common in sports events, managing them correctly at the game at the time of injury, can reduce long term issues. They require prompt evaluation, diagnosis, reduction, and post-reduction management before the person can be evaluated at a medical facility. After a dislocation, injured joints are usually held in place by a splint (for straight joints like fingers and toes) or a bandage (for complex joints like shoulders).

==== Immobilization ====
Immobilization is a method of treatment to place the injured joint in a sling or in another immobilizing device in order to keep the joint stable. There is no significant difference in healing or long-term joint mobility between simple shoulder dislocations treated conservatively versus surgically. Shorter immobilization periods are encouraged, with the goal of return to increased range-of-motion activities as soon as possible. Shorter immobilization periods is linked to increased ranges of motion in some joints.

==== Rehabilitation ====
Muscles, tendons and ligaments around the joint should be strengthened. This is usually done through a course of physical therapy, which will also help reduce the chances of repeated dislocations of the same joint. Take the shoulder for example. The most common treatment method for a dislocation of the shoulder joint is exercise based management. For shoulder instability, the therapeutic program depends on specific characteristics of the instability pattern, severity, recurrence and direction with adaptations made based on the needs of the patient. In general, the therapeutic program should focus on restoration of strength, normalization of range of motion and optimization of flexibility and muscular performance. Throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program, it is important to take all related joints and structures into consideration.

=== Operative ===
Surgery is often considered in extensive injuries or after failure of conservative management with strengthening exercises. The need for surgery will depend on the location of the dislocation and the extent of the injury. Different methods and techniques exist to stabilize the joint with surgery. One method is through the use of arthroscopic surgery.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis varies depending on the location and extent of the dislocation. The prognosis of a shoulder dislocation is dependent on various factors including age, strength, connective tissue health and severity of the injury causing the dislocation. There is a good prognosis in simple elbow dislocations in younger people. Older people report more pain and stiffness on average. Wrist dislocations are often difficult to manage due to the difficulty in healing the small bones in the wrist. Finger displacement towards the back of the hand is often irreducible due to associated injuries, while finger displacement towards the palm of the hand is more readily reducible. Overall, recovering from a joint dislocation can range from a few weeks to months, depending on the severity of the injury.

==Epidemiology==
Each joint in the body can be dislocated, however, there are common sites where most dislocations occur. The most common dislocated parts of the body are discussed as follows:
* Dislocated shoulder
** Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common type of shoulder dislocation, accounting for at least 90% of shoulder dislocations. Anterior shoulder dislocations have a recurrence rate around 39%, with younger age at initial dislocation, male sex, and joint hyperlaxity being risk factors for increased recurrence.
** The incidence rate of anterior shoulder dislocations is roughly 23.1 to 23.9 per 100,000 person-years. Young males have a higher incidence rate, roughly four times that of the overall population.
** Recurrent anterior shoulder dislocations have a higher rate of labrum tears (Bankart lesion) and humerus fractures/dents (Hill-Sachs lesion) compared to initial dislocations.
** Shoulder dislocations account for 45% of all dislocation visits to the emergency room.
* Elbow
** The incidence rate of elbow dislocations is 5 to 6 per 100,000 persons per year.
** Posterior dislocations are the most common type of elbow dislocations, comprising 90% of all elbow dislocations.
* Wrist
** Overall, injuries to the small bones and ligaments in the wrist are uncommon.
** Lunate dislocations are the most common.
* Finger 
** Interphalangeal (IP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint dislocations
*** In the United States, men are most likely to sustain a finger dislocation with an incidence rate of 17.8 per 100,000 person-years. Women have an incidence rate of 4.65 per 100,000 person-years. The average age group that sustain a finger dislocation are between 15 and 19 years old.
*** The most common dislocations are in the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints.
* Hip
** Posterior and anterior hip dislocation
*** Anterior dislocations are less common than posterior dislocations. 10% of all dislocations are anterior and this is broken down into superior and inferior types. Superior dislocations account for 10% of all anterior dislocations, and inferior dislocations account for 90%. 16-40 year old males are more likely to receive dislocations due to a car accident. 
*** When an individual receives a hip dislocation, there is an incidence rate of 95% that they will receive an injury to another part of their body as well. 
*** 46–84% of hip dislocations occur secondary to traffic accidents, the remaining percentage is due based on falls, industrial accidents or sporting injury.
* Knee
** The majority of knee dislocations (64.5%) are caused by trauma to the knee, with more than half caused by car and motorcycle accidents.
** The incidence rate of initial patellar dislocations is roughly 32.8 per 100,000 person years.
** Nearly 41% of knee dislocations have an associated fracture, with the majority of these fractures in one of the legs.
** Nerve injury occurs in about 15.3% of knee dislocations, while major artery injury occurs in 7.8% of knee dislocations.
** More than half (53.5%) of knee dislocations have an associated torn meniscus.
** Quadriceps tendon rupture occurs up to 13.1% of the time, and patellar tendon rupture occurs 6.8% of the time.
* Foot and Ankle
** A lisfranc injury is a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints.
** A subtalar dislocation, or talocalcaneonavicular dislocation, is a simultaneous dislocation of the talar joints at the talocalcaneal and talonavicular levels. 
** Subtalar dislocations without associated fractures represent about 1% of all traumatic injuries of the foot. They represent 1-2% of all dislocations and are caused by high energy trauma.
** A total talar dislocation has high rates of complications but is rare.
** Ankle sprains primarily occur as a result of tearing the ATFL (anterior talofibular ligament) in the talocrural joint. The ATFL tears most easily when the foot is in plantarflexion and inversion. Weakening of the ligaments can put the ankle at risk for dislocation.
** An ankle dislocation without fracture is rare, due to the strength of ligaments surrounding the ankle.

<doc id="1168582" wikidata="Q5083283" url="?curid=1168582" title="Charles W. Woodworth">
<text>Charles William Woodworth (April 28, 1865 – November 19, 1940) was an American entomologist. He published extensively in entomology and founded the Entomology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the first person to breed the model organism &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit fly) in captivity and to suggest to early genetic researchers at Harvard its use for scientific research. He spent four years at the University of Nanking, China, where he effected the practical control of the city&#x27;s mosquitoes. He drafted and lobbied for California&#x27;s first insecticide law and administered the law for 12 years. The Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America named its annual career achievement award the C. W. Woodworth Award.

==Birth and early life== 
He was born in Champaign, Illinois, on April 28, 1865, to Alvin Oakley Woodworth and Mary Celina (Carpenter) Woodworth. His father was a merchant but died when Charles was four. Some years later, his mother married Alvin&#x27;s older brother Stephen Elias Woodworth to help raise Charles and his older brother Howard. Stephen had earlier been a resident of Seneca Falls, New York, and was a signatory of the 1848 Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments.

==Career overview==
Charles graduated with a BS in 1885 and an MS in 1886 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The funds received from the judgment in the 1884 U.S. Supreme Court Case, New England Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Woodworth, may have helped pay for his education. During the period of 1884–1886, he was assistant to S.A. Forbes. From 1886 to 1888 he studied at Harvard University under Hermann August Hagen, who, at the time, was the leading entomologist of the U.S. He returned between 1900 and 1901 and worked under William E. Castle. In 1888, he was appointed entomologist and botanist at the University of Arkansas&#x27;s Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station. On September 4, 1889, he married Leonora Stern in Rolla, Missouri, the city where her parents, Edward Stern and Lizzie Hardin Evans Stern, lived. Charles suffered from successive attacks of malaria while in Arkansas. He left there in 1891 to become assistant in entomology at the University of California (now UC Berkeley) where he founded and built up the Division of Entomology. He also participated in the development of the Agricultural Experiment Station, now known as UC Davis, and is also considered the founder of the Entomology Department there.

At Berkeley, he rose to be Assistant Professor in 1891, Associate Professor in 1904, Professor in 1913, and was named Emeritus Professor upon his retirement in 1930.

==Proposal on the use of &quot;Drosophila&quot;==
Woodworth is credited with first breeding &quot;Drosophila&quot; in quantity while he was at Harvard. Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s Nobel Prize biography says that Woodworth suggested to William E. Castle that Drosophila might be used for genetical work. Castle and his associates used it for their work on the effects of inbreeding, and through them F. E. Lutz became interested in it and the latter introduced it to Morgan, who was looking for a species that could be bred in the very limited space at his command.

==Four years in China==
While on sabbatical leave in 1918, he was a lecturer at the University of Nanking and honorary professor of entomology at the National Southeastern University at Nanking, China. During his year there he effected a practical control of mosquitoes for the first time in that city&#x27;s history. He returned for a three-year period in 1921–1924. During this period he organized the Kiangsu Provincial Bureau of Entomology as well as many other things. In the words of the president of the University of Nanking, &quot;He served China in a magnificent way.&quot;

==Publications and policy efforts==
His publications were very extensive and included nearly every field of entomology. A few of his most outstanding works are: &quot;A List of the Insects of California (1903), The Wing Veins of Insects&quot; (1906), &quot;Guide to California Insects&quot; (1913), and &quot;School of Fumigation&quot; (1915). He was the first editor and first contributor to the University of California Publications in Entomology.

He had much to do with the responsible use of pesticides. He proposed and drafted the first California Insecticide Law in 1906, was largely instrumental in securing its passage in 1911, and administered the law until July 1, 1923. Entomological campaigns which he conducted in California concerned the codling moth, the peach twig-borer, citrus insects, grasshoppers, and citrus white fly eradication.

==Family and home==
Charles and Leonora had four children: Lawrence, Harold, Charles, and Elizabeth. His son, Dr. Charles E. Woodworth, also became an entomologist; he worked for the USDA ARS focusing on the wireworm and served as an entomologist with the Army in the Pacific during World War II with the rank of Major, commanding a unit which cleared swamps.

Their home at 2237 Carleton Street in Berkeley, that he designed, was designated a Berkeley Landmark in 1993. He had many avocations including making telescopes, analyzing chess positions, and researching his extended family&#x27;s genealogy.

==The C.W. Woodworth Award==
C.W. was an 1889 charter member of the American Association of Economic Entomologists (an association which merged with the Entomological Society of America, founded 1906, in 1953). The Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America selects a member of the society to win the C. W. Woodworth Award based on &quot;outstanding accomplishments in entomology over at least the past 10 years.&quot; Here is a nearly complete list of winners since 1969. This award is principally sponsored by his great-grandson, Brian Holden, and his wife, Joann Wilfert, with additional support by Dr. Craig and Kathryn Holden, and Dr. Jim and Betty Woodworth.

<doc id="1168597" wikidata="Q10750855" url="?curid=1168597" title="Crocuta">
<text>Crocuta is a genus of hyena containing the largest extant member of the family, the spotted hyena &quot;(Crocuta crocuta)&quot;. Several fossil species are also known, with the Pleistocene Eurasian cave hyenas either being regarded as distinct species or subspecies of the spotted hyena.

==Taxonomy==
It is still unclear whether the genus evolved in Africa or Asia, although the oldest known fossils are from Africa and dated to about 3.8 mya. The earliest remains from Asia currently attributed to the genus is &quot;Crocuta honanensis&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of China dating to around 2.5-2.2 million years ago, but its relationship to the living spotted hyena is ambiguous. &quot;Crocuta&quot; first appears in Europe around 800,000 years ago at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, replacing the giant hyena &quot;Pachycrocuta&quot;.

The Eurasian &quot;cave hyenas&quot; (&quot;Crocuta spelaea&quot;, &quot;Crocuta ultima&quot; and others) have either been considered subspecies of the living spotted hyena, or as distinct species. Genetic analysis of cave hyenas have found them to be strongly genetically divergent from living African spotted hyenas, albeit with some evidence of limited interbreeding between the two populations.

Two extinct species are known to have coexisted with each other in eastern Africa during the Pliocene; &quot;Crocuta eturono&quot; and &quot;Crocuta dietrichi&quot;, each one probably occupying a different niche in regards to their preference for scavenging or hunting. In Ahl al Oughlam, a Pliocene site in Morocco, lived the species &quot;Crocuta dbaa&quot;. In China there was a Pliocene species, &quot;Crocuta honanensis&quot;, The holotype of &quot;Crocuta sivalensis&quot; from the Indian subcontinent has been determined to be a specimen of &quot;Pliocrocuta&quot; and unrelated to &quot;Crocuta&quot; proper.

<text>The European Round Table for Industry (previously known as the European Round Table of Industrialists), abbreviated ERT, is a cross-sectoral forum and advocacy group in the European Union consisting of some 60 European industrial businesspeople working on competitiveness in Europe.

== History ==
The European economy in the early 1980s was regarded by some economists as suffering from eurosclerosis; the European Economic Community (EEC) was perceived in some quarters as suffering from a lack of innovation and competitiveness.

Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the CEO of Volvo, brought together 7 European business leaders on 6 and 7 April 1983 to create an organisation aiming to communicate that Europe needed to modernise its industrial bases. The initial members were Gyllenhammar, Karl Beurle (Thyssen), Carlo De Benedetti (Olivetti), Curt Nicolin (ASEA), Harry Gray (United Technologies), John Harvey-Jones (ICI), Wolfgang Seelig (Siemens), Umberto Agnelli (Fiat), Peter Baxendell (Shell), Olivier Lecerf (Lafarge Coppée), José Bidegain (Cie de St Gobain), Wisse Dekker (Philips), Antoine Riboud (BSN), Bernard Hanon (Renault), Louis von Planta (Ciba-Geigy) and Helmut Maucher (Nestlé). François-Xavier Ortoli. Étienne Davignon of the European Commission attended the latter part of the meeting. During meetings that followed later that year, the ERT was established.

=== The Single Market ===
Promoting the European single market would become ERT’s objective. In its first publication, a memorandum to the EC Commissioner Étienne Davignon in April 1983, the ERT catalogued the challenges&#x27; they saw in the European industry. Among these was the need to upgrade infrastructure, roads and communications.

In November 1984, ERT co-founding member Wisse Dekker (Philips) presented &quot;Europe 1990: An Agenda for Action&quot;, a plan backed by the ERT on achieving a European Single Market, at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. The plan was then presented at a public speech in January 1985 to an audience with the newly appointed Commissioners, led by Jacques Delors. Delors’ speech to the European Parliament a few days later set out his ideas for completing the Single Market. In June 1985, the European Commission published its white paper &quot;Completing the Single Market&quot;, which led to the Single European Act of 1986.

ERT promoted the construction of the Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden as part of its &quot;European Link&quot; project. This project also included several other international European infrastructural projects, such as the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link between Denmark and Germany. Later, ERT became active in the promotion of the earliest Trans-European Networks.

=== 1990s ===
During the 1990s, the chairment of ERT were: Wisse Dekker (Netherlands), Jérôme Monod (France) and Helmut Maucher (Switzerland), with Keith Richardson as secretary general. During this time, ERT published reports encouraging the first global G8 cooperation on building common standards. Later, this work was recognised by several country leaders, including President Bill Clinton. The ERT was a vocal supporter of EU enlargement.

=== 2000–2019 ===
The ERT published its paper &quot;Actions for Competitiveness through the Knowledge Economy in Europe&quot; in March 2001, calling for national education systems to focus on in-demand skills and for employers to invest in lifelong learning. It stressed easier access to venture capital and intellectual property protection.

In September 2009, ERT called for the creation of a European coordinating body. This would eventually come into effect in 2011 in the shape of the European Coordinating Body in Maths, Science and Technology Education (ECB), which ran until 2014. The decline of research and development (R&amp;D) investment in Europe was one of five main topics addressed in ERT’s &quot;Vision for a Competitive Europe in 2025&quot;, published in February 2010.

In 2019, Secretary General Frank Heemskerk revised the name and brand of ERT and expanded its secretariat.

==Criticism==
&quot;The Brussels Business&quot; is a 2013 documentary film by Friedrich Moser and Matthieu Lietaert with the topic on the lack of transparency and the influence of lobbyists on the European Union&#x27;s decision-making processes. ERT figures largely in the film as an organisation that has had the closest links with the EU; those on European traffic networks borrowed heavily from ERT reports.

In a report by the former secretary general of the ERT, Keith Richardson, entitled &quot;Big Business and the European Agenda&quot;, the Action for Solidarity, Equality, Environment and Diversity Europe&#x27;s (ASEED Europe&#x27;s) report called &quot;Misshaping Europe&quot; is quoted.

<text>The Vickers Viking was a British single-engine amphibious aircraft designed for military use shortly after World War I. Later versions of the aircraft were known as the Vickers Vulture and Vickers Vanellus.

==Design and development==

Research on Vickers&#x27; first amphibious aircraft type began in December 1918 with tests of alternative fuselage/hull designs occurring in an experimental tank at St Albans in Hertfordshire, England. A prototype, registered G-EAOV, was a five-seat cabin biplane with a pusher propeller driven by a Rolls-Royce Falcon water-cooled V 12 engine. Sir John Alcock died taking this aircraft to the Paris exhibition on 18 December 1919, whilst trying to land at Côte d&#x27;Evrard, near Rouen, Normandy in foggy weather.

The next example, G-EASC, known as the Viking II, had a greater wing span and a 360 hp Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII motor. The Viking III machine, piloted by Captain Stan Cockerell, won first prize in the amphibian class in Air Ministry competitions held in September and October, 1920.

The Type 54 Viking IV incorporated further refinements and had a wider cabin above a hull one foot wider, an example being G-EBBZ in which Ross Smith and J.M. Bennett (partners in the 1919 England to Australia flight) died on 13 April 1922 just outside the Brooklands racetrack near Weybridge in Surrey. Most of these Mark IV Vikings had a Napier Lion engine.

The next version was the Viking V; two were built for the RAF for service in Iraq.

A further development with a redesigned wing structure using the 450 hp (340 kW) Napier Lion would have been the Viking VI (Vickers designation Type 78) but known as the Vulture I. A second with a Rolls-Royce Eagle IX (360 hp, 270 kW) was the Type 95 Vulture II. Both Vultures were used for an unsuccessful around the world attempt in 1924 after the Eagle engine of the Vulture II was replaced with a Lion. With registration G-EBHO, the first set off from Calshot Seaplane Base on 25 March 1924, the other was shipped as a spare machine to Tokyo. After mechanical difficulties in earlier stages G-EBHO crashed at Akyab where it was replaced by G-EBGO on 25 June. Encountering heavy fog on the Siberian side of the Bering Sea G-EBGO crashed. Vickers salvaged a large proportion.

The Viking Mark VII (&quot;Type 83&quot; in Vickers numbering) was a development of the Vulture, a three-seat open-cockpit fleet spotter to Air Ministry specification 46/22 given the service name &quot;Vanellus&quot; when taken on for evaluation by the RAF against the Supermarine Seagull design.

==Operational history==
The last Viking amphibians were built during 1923, but the name was re-used for the twin-engine VC.1 Viking airliner some 22 years later, which saw service as the Valetta with the RAF and other air arms. Canadian Vickers Limited, a subsidiary company in Montreal with no previous aircraft manufacturing experience, assembled two Viking IV amphibians and built a further six for the Royal Canadian Air Force . Their involvement with the Viking led to a future line of indigenous flying boats beginning with the Canadian Vickers Vedette.

No Vikings survive today although a full-size replica built for the film &quot;The People That Time Forgot&quot; (1977) is displayed at Brooklands Museum in Surrey.

<doc id="1168608" wikidata="Q525964" url="?curid=1168608" title="Adelic algebraic group">
<text>In abstract algebra, an adelic algebraic group is a semitopological group defined by an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a number field &quot;K&quot;, and the adele ring &quot;A&quot; = &quot;A&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of &quot;K&quot;. It consists of the points of &quot;G&quot; having values in &quot;A&quot;; the definition of the appropriate topology is straightforward only in case &quot;G&quot; is a linear algebraic group. In the case of &quot;G&quot; being an abelian variety, it presents a technical obstacle, though it is known that the concept is potentially useful in connection with Tamagawa numbers. Adelic algebraic groups are widely used in number theory, particularly for the theory of automorphic representations, and the arithmetic of quadratic forms.

In case &quot;G&quot; is a linear algebraic group, it is an affine algebraic variety in affine &quot;N&quot;-space. The topology on the adelic algebraic group formula_1 is taken to be the subspace topology in &quot;A&quot;&quot;N&quot;, the Cartesian product of &quot;N&quot; copies of the adele ring. In this case, formula_1 is a topological group.

==History of the terminology==
Historically the &quot;idèles&quot; () were introduced by under the name &quot;élément idéal&quot;, which is &quot;ideal element&quot; in French, which then abbreviated to &quot;idèle&quot; following a suggestion of Hasse. (In these papers he also gave the ideles a non-Hausdorff topology.) This was to formulate class field theory for infinite extensions in terms of topological groups. defined (but did not name) the ring of adeles in the function field case and pointed out that Chevalley&#x27;s group of &quot;Idealelemente&quot; was the group of invertible elements of this ring. defined the ring of adeles as a restricted direct product, though he called its elements &quot;valuation vectors&quot; rather than adeles.

 defined the ring of adeles in the function field case, under the name &quot;repartitions&quot;; the contemporary term &quot;adèle&quot; stands for &#x27;additive idèles&#x27;, and can also be a French woman&#x27;s name. The term adèle was in use shortly afterwards and may have been introduced by André Weil. The general construction of adelic algebraic groups by followed the algebraic group theory founded by Armand Borel and Harish-Chandra.

==Ideles==
An important example, the idele group (ideal element group) &quot;I&quot;(&quot;K&quot;), is the case of formula_3. Here the set of ideles consists of the invertible adeles; but the topology on the idele group is &quot;not&quot; their topology as a subset of the adeles. Instead, considering that formula_4 lies in two-dimensional affine space as the &#x27;hyperbola&#x27; defined parametrically by

: formula_5

the topology correctly assigned to the idele group is that induced by inclusion in &quot;A&quot;2; composing with a projection, it follows that the ideles carry a finer topology than the subspace topology from &quot;A&quot;.

Inside &quot;A&quot;&quot;N&quot;, the product &quot;K&quot;&quot;N&quot; lies as a discrete subgroup. This means that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) is a discrete subgroup of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), also. In the case of the idele group, the quotient group

: formula_6

is the idele class group. It is closely related to (though larger than) the ideal class group. The idele class group is not itself compact; the ideles must first be replaced by the ideles of norm 1, and then the image of those in the idele class group is a compact group; the proof of this is essentially equivalent to the finiteness of the class number.

The study of the Galois cohomology of idele class groups is a central matter in class field theory. Characters of the idele class group, now usually called Hecke characters or Größencharacters, give rise to the most basic class of L-functions.

==Tamagawa numbers==
For more general &quot;G&quot;, the Tamagawa number is defined (or indirectly computed) as the measure of

:&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)/&quot;G&quot;(&quot;K&quot;).

Tsuneo Tamagawa&#x27;s observation was that, starting from an invariant differential form ω on &quot;G&quot;, defined &quot;over K&quot;, the measure involved was well-defined: while ω could be replaced by &quot;c&quot;ω with &quot;c&quot; a non-zero element of &quot;K&quot;, the product formula for valuations in &quot;K&quot; is reflected by the independence from &quot;c&quot; of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from ω on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for semisimple groups contains important parts of classical quadratic form theory.

<text>Leopold IV of Austria (1371 – June 3, 1411), Duke of Further Austria, was an Austrian Habsburg Duke of the &quot;Leopoldinian Line&quot;, known as &quot;the Fat&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was the second son of Leopold III. His eldest brother Duke William of Inner Austria took him as his effective co-ruler, putting him in particular charge of Further Austria, which also meant ancestral Habsburg lands in Swiss Aargau etc. Leopold was to face Swiss opposition to Austrian administration.

From 1391 onwards, he was the effective ruler of Further Austria, and from 1396 to 1406 he was ruler in Tyrol too.

He married Catherine de Valois of Burgundy, daughter of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, in 1393. She died in 1425, and they had no surviving children.

His younger brothers Ernest the Iron and Frederick were, for the time being, left to grow up. They were initiated with ducal positions in 1402. In 1406 their eldest brother Duke William died without leaving heirs, and Leopold became the next head of their family. Leopold had no sons either. The younger brothers made an agreement how to divide the patrimony in the future: Ernest was to receive Inner Austria and Frederick Further Austria, including Tyrol. Ernest took the reins in Styria, etc. Frederick was only barely in his twenties, but was put in charge in Tyrol. Leopold was left with responsibility of the Further Austrian territories, together with the position of head of the family.

In 1406, Leopold took over the guardianship of their young cousin Albert V, which resulted in conflicts with his brother Ernest.

Leopold died in Vienna and was buried in the Ducal Crypt in the city&#x27;s cathedral.

With only one bedroom, plus bedrooms for servants, it was built in 1935 at 10000 Tampa Avenue, Northridge, on a plot of 13 acres (5 hectares) in California&#x27;s then-rural San Fernando Valley for the movie director Josef von Sternberg. The house was demolished in 1972 and the land became a housing development. Much of the estate&#x27;s land had been sold off (mostly for agriculture) decades earlier and its final size was four acres.

The design of the house contrasts with most typical homes. It had a very small number of rooms and a relatively small square footage. While it did have a few features of ostentatious display, such as a separate, larger and higher garage bay for a Duesenberg automobile in addition to the two other garage bays for lesser automobiles (in an era where even rich homes had only one or two-car garages) most of its characteristics were original and discreet, showing Neutra&#x27;s attention to the integration of custom details, such as the surrounding moats.

The exterior of the house was all steel and glass, and the appearance of the house and of its landscaped surroundings was made of sinuous lines, yet the interiors were orthogonal, making furniture placement simple and easy. As in many others of his domestic designs, Neutra made heavy use of industrial windows and sidings, fulfilling both aesthetic and practical functions, such as making privacy screens and windbreaks.

Neutra was mindful of his customer&#x27;s desires even when he found them absurd. He would later regale his friends with the story (among others) of Sternberg asking that none of the bathroom doors should have locks, in order to prevent his party guests from locking themselves in and threatening to commit suicide. As a movie director, Sternberg was well acquainted with the theatrical behavior of many Hollywood actors, while Neutra had a social life which kept him in touch with artists in other domains.

In the 1940s, novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand bought the house. Although concerned by the property&#x27;s 20 mile (32 km) distance from Hollywood, where she worked as a screenwriter, Rand and her husband actor Frank O&#x27;Connor paid $24,000 for the house. In 1963, according to Rand&#x27;s biographer Barbara Branden, she and O&#x27;Connor sold the house for $175,000. The sale was arranged by the post-Rand occupant, author Ruth Beebe Hill, who, along with her husband Buzzy Hill and collaborator Chunksa Uha, rented the house from Rand for many years after Rand moved to New York. It was purchased by the property&#x27;s next-door neighbor who had it demolished the day after the Hills moved to Washington State, fearing trespass and squatting by &quot;hippies.&quot;

Andy Moore (1956-present), who lived across the street from the house at the northwest corner of Tampa and Mayall Streets from 1961-1972, knew the Hills and Chunksa Uha and shot a Super-8 film, &quot;Destruction,&quot; of the demolition of the Von Sternberg House (https://andystreasuretrove.com/destruction also https://andystreasuretrove.com/films). Several other of Moore&#x27;s Super-8 films show the Von Sternberg house in the background, and he was a frequent visitor and later groundskeeper there.

<text>The New Zealand men&#x27;s national basketball team () represents New Zealand in international basketball competitions. The team is governed by Basketball New Zealand. The team&#x27;s official nickname is the Tall Blacks ().

Over their history, New Zealand have won three FIBA Oceania Championships, made seven appearances at the FIBA World Cup and two at the Olympic Games. Since 2017, the team has made two appearances at the FIBA Asia Cup, with their best effort resulting in a bronze medal finish in 2022.

==Haka==
Prior to games, the Tall Blacks perform a haka. The team&#x27;s current haka, &quot;Tu Kaha O Pango Te Kahikatea&quot;, was composed and created in 2006 by Don Hutana and former Tall Black Paora Winitana. It tells the story of how the Tall Blacks overcome great odds and challenges through their adventures. It also draws from the story of Tāne and how he overcame adversity to gain the three baskets of knowledge.

==History==

===Inaugural year===

The Tall Blacks&#x27; first game was played against Singapore on 1 September 1962. That year, they played a further eight games in Asia against Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

===1970s===

In 1970, New Zealand hosted the world number 6 Czechoslovakia for a test series. The Tall Blacks lost both games, 115–60 and 118–62.

In 1971, New Zealand hosted the first FIBA Oceania Championship. The Oceania qualification zone was created by FIBA so Australia and New Zealand could compete every two years to decide which country would represent the zone at the Olympic Games or the world championships. The Tall Blacks lost the inaugural series 0–3.

In 1974, New Zealand played against Australia, the Philippines and Tahiti. They split the series 2–2, with both wins coming against Tahiti.

In the 1975 FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks lost 0–3 to Australia.

In the 1978 FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks recorded their first win against Australia, 67–65. They lost the series 1–2. That same year, the Tall Blacks won the silver medal at the Commonwealth championships in Britain.

In the 1979 FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks again lost 0–3 to Australia.

===1980s===

The Tall Blacks participated in the William Jones Cup in 1980, 1981 and 1982.

In 1983, they participated in the Kirin Invitational and Taiwan Tournament. That same year, New Zealand hosted the Commonwealth Basketball Championships (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s). Both teams finished without medals, and the New Zealand Basketball Federation (NZBF), hoping to make a profit, suffered a $50,000 loss.

The Tall Blacks gained a wild card entry to the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain. They managed one win against Malaysia to finish 21st in the 24-team tournament. Stan Hill announced his retirement following the tournament after 131 games.

In 1987, Russia played a two-match series against the Tall Blacks in New Zealand. The Tall Blacks lost both games. That same year, New Zealand finished second in the Oceania series, beating French Polynesia and losing to Australia.

===1990s===
Throughout the 1990s, the Tall Blacks were invited to a number of tournaments:

*1994 Tour of Japan won the series 4–2
*1997 Harlem Basketball Tournament, Netherlands
*1997 Portugal and Madrid Xmas Tournaments, Europe
*1998 Anhui Tournament, China
*1998 Nanjing Tournament, China
*1998 Ningbo Tournament, China
*1998 Heife Tournament, China

New Zealand also hosted Japan (won series 3–0, 1991), Croatia (lost series 0–1, 1997) and Canada (tied series 1–1, 1998).

In 1997, New Caledonia joined the Tall Blacks and Australia for the Oceania Championship that was held in New Zealand. It was in this tournament that the Tall Blacks registered their largest ever win margin and score, defeating New Caledonia 136–41. However, they lost to Australia in pool play and the final to once again miss out on the 1998 World Championships.

The Tall Blacks returned to Taiwan for the 1999 William Jones Cup, finishing third after going 5–3. The 1999 FIBA Oceania Championship was a one-off game between the Tall Blacks and Guam, with New Zealand winning 125–43 and qualifying for the Olympic Games for the first time. Future NBA players Kirk Penney and Sean Marks debuted for the Tall Blacks in 1999.

===2000s===

In 2000, the Tall Blacks participated in the Slam Down Under tournament in Sydney in June, the William Jones Cup in Taiwan in July, and the Summer Olympics in September. In their first ever Olympic appearance, the Tall Blacks were placed in Group A alongside the United States, Italy, China, Latvia and France. They finished 11th with a 1–6 record, picking up their first Olympic win against Angola (70–60). Sean Marks finished the tournament second in rebounds (7.3 per game) and Pero Cameron finished the tournament second in steals (1.7 per game).

In 2001, the Tall Blacks participated in the Goodwill Games in Brisbane. Kirk Penney averaged a team-leading 14.8 points as New Zealand finished sixth. In the FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks won the first fixture of the three-game series against Australia 85–78 but lost the second game 81–79 in overtime. In the third game, New Zealand made history with an 89–78 win, beating Australia 2–1 to qualify for the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis.

The Tall Blacks had a prolonged Europe tour prior to the 2002 FIBA World Championship that included a victory over world champs Yugoslavia. They entered the World Championship with a level of confidence under coach Tab Baldwin. The team had Sean Marks and Pero Cameron in career-best form alongside two world-class sharpshooters in Phill Jones and Kirk Penney. There was also Mark Dickel, Paul Henare, Ed Book and Dillon Boucher. The Tall Blacks pushed into the second round after beating China, Venezuela and Russia. Losses came at the hands of the United States, Argentina and Germany in Group D. In the quarter-finals, they beat Puerto Rico 65–63 to earn a spot in the semi-final against Yugoslavia. They went on to lose 89–78 to Yugoslavia and then lost 117–94 to Germany in the bronze medal match. Fourth place is still the team&#x27;s best finish at a World Cup / World Championship as of 2022. Cameron was named to the All-Tournament team and Jones finished the tournament as its ninth-leading scorer with 18.2 points per game.

In 2003, the Tall Blacks participated in the Efes Pilsen World Cup in Turkey and lost 0–3 to Australia in the FIBA Oceania Championship. The Oceania series determined seedings for the 2004 Athens Olympics.

In the lead up to the Olympics, the Tall Blacks had a series against Australia and then toured the U.S. and Europe. They finished the Athens Olympics with a 1–5 record in group A against Italy, China, Serbia and Montenegro, Argentina and Spain. In the play-off for 9th position they lost to Australia 98–80, finishing 10th. Phill Jones&#x27; 21 points per game left him as the Games&#x27; second-leading scorer behind Pau Gasol of Spain.

In 2005, the Tall Blacks won the Shuang Feng Cup in China and participated in the inaugural Gaze Cup in Australia. In the FIBA Oceania Championship, they lost 0–3 to Australia.

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, the Tall Blacks reached the gold medal game, where they lost 81–76 to Australia. Later that year at the FIBA World Championship, New Zealand were considered a long shot for a medal following the retirements of Sean Marks and Ed Book. They were on the verge of not advancing out of the first round after losing its first three games and being down 18 points at halftime to Japan in the fourth game. They came back to win that game 60–57 and beat Panama to advance to the second round, where they lost to the reigning Olympic champions, Argentina. Tab Baldwin subsequently resigned as the head coach of the Tall Blacks, replaced by then assistant coach Nenad Vučinić.

In 2007, the Tall Blacks went 2–3 at the Stanković Cup and went 1–2 at the FIBA Oceania Championship against Australia.

In 2008, the Tall Blacks went 0-2 against Australia in the Al Ramsay Shield series in Melbourne and 2–1 at the Jack Donohue International Classic tournament in Toronto. At the Olympic qualifying tournament, the team reached the quarterfinal, where they lost to Greece and subsequently missed the Beijing Olympics.

In the 2009 FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks defeated Australia on aggregate, winning game two 100–78.

===2010s===
At the 2010 FIBA World Championship, the Tall Blacks lost in the round of 16. It saw them drop five places to 18th in the FIBA world rankings.

In 2011, the Tall Blacks won the Stanković Cup in China after beating Russia in the final. Kirk Penney and Thomas Abercrombie named in the tournament All-Star five. At the FIBA Oceania Championship, the team lost 0–3 to Australia.

In the lead up to the 2012 Olympic Qualifying Tournament, the Tall Blacks suffered heavy defeats in Brazil without injured duo Penney and Abercrombie. They went on to finish 10th in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament.

In the 2013 FIBA Oceania Championship, the Tall Blacks lost 0–2 to Australia. They went on to reach the final 16 of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. After this tournament, Penney, Casey Frank and coach Vucinic retired from international basketball.

In 2015, the Tall Blacks had a European tour under new head coach Paul Henare. They went on to win the Stanković Cup and lose 0–2 to Australia in the FIBA Oceania Championship.

At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Tall Blacks finished third with a 79-69 win over Scotland in the bronze medal match. Despite boasting a 7–1 record in the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifying campaign, on the back of seven straight wins, the Tall Blacks remained in 38th place on the FIBA World Ranking list as of September 2018.

In August 2019, the Tall Blacks had a two-game series in Japan and before heading to Australia to play Canada.

===2020s===
In February 2020, the Tall Blacks had secured wins over Australia and Guam in the first round of Asia Cup qualifiers. Following this, however, the team was heavily disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, games against Australia and Hong Kong were postponed, with the next FIBA window being in February 2021.

In February 2021, the Tall Blacks played Australia in Cairns, Queensland. A number of regular players were unavailable due to Australian NBL commitments, and due to the pandemic, quarantine periods also forced the Tall Blacks to create an Australian-based team, with many being based in Queensland. They lost 52–81. It marked Mika Vukona&#x27;s final game for the Tall Blacks. Following the game, Basketball New Zealand withdrew the Tall Blacks from the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Serbia.

The Tall Blacks made history in their first game of the 2022 Asia Cup Qualifiers, beating the Boomers in Australia for the first time in over 10 years. They followed up that win with another against Guam. They subsequently played in the FIBA Asia Cup in July 2022, where they won bronze.

In August 2023, the Tall Blacks competed in the Super Cup in Hamburg against China, Canada and hosts Germany. That same month, they competed at the FIBA Solidarity Cup in China. New Zealand was one of the first countries to qualify for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, having secured a spot in the 32-team tournament a year earlier. It marked their seventh world cup appearance. They finished the tournament with a 2–3 record and gained entry into one of the 2024 Olympic Qualifying tournaments.

<text>HMS &quot;Royal Katherine (HMS &quot;Ramillies after 1706) was an 84-gun full-rigged second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched in 1664 at Woolwich Dockyard. Her launching was conducted by Charles II and attended by Samuel Pepys. &quot;Royal Katherine&quot; fought in both the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars and afterwards, the War of the Grand Alliance before entering the dockyard at Portsmouth for rebuilding in 1702. 
In this rebuilding, she was upgraded to carry more guns, 90 in total, and served in the War of the Spanish Succession during which she was renamed &quot;Ramillies&quot; in honour of John Churchill&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ramillies. She was rebuilt again in 1742–3 before serving as the flagship of the ill-fated Admiral John Byng in the Seven Years&#x27; War. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was wrecked at Bolt Tail near Hope Cove on 15 February 1760.

== Launch==
&quot;Royal Katherine&quot; was launched in 1664 by Charles II, an event attended by naval administrator Samuel Pepys. Pepys recorded the occasion in his diary and it was dramatised by BBC Radio 4 in 2012 as part of series 5 of &quot;The Diary of Samuel Pepys&quot;.

== Anglo-Dutch wars==
&quot;Royal Katherine&quot; participated in the Second Anglo-Dutch War fighting in the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, the Four Days&#x27; Battle from 11 June to 14 June 1666 and the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle on 4 August 1666. She was scuttled in June 1667 to prevent her capture by the Dutch during the Raid on the Medway.

Refloated, &quot;Royal Katherine&quot; fought again during the Third Anglo-Dutch War of 1672–4. She was captured by the Dutch during the Battle of Solebay on 7 June 1672 but was retaken the same day. &quot;Royal Katherine&quot; was also part of the Anglo-French fleet for the Battle of Schooneveld. She saw action in the War of the Grand Alliance, fighting at the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692.

== Rebuilds ==
&quot;Royal Katherine&quot; was rebuilt at Portsmouth in 1702 and became a 90-gun second rate. 

She served as the flagship of Admiral George Rooke in the War of the Spanish Succession from 1701.

Between 1 and 4 August 1704 Anglo-Dutch forces of the Grand Alliance under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt together with Admiral Sir George Rooke, flying his flag aboard HMS Royal Katherine, lead Royal Navy and Royal Marines units to capture Gibraltar.

In 1706 she was renamed &quot;Ramillies&quot; in honour of John Churchill&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ramillies fought that year. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was rebuilt again at Portsmouth Dockyard between 30 November 1742 and 8 February 1743. She remained a 90-gun second rate in accordance with 1741 proposals of the 1719 Establishment, relaunching on 8 February.

She saw service in the Seven Years&#x27; War and was the flagship of Admiral John Byng when he failed to relieve Port Mahon and so lost the island of Minorca to the French. Byng was later controversially executed for this action.

==Wreck==
&quot;Ramillies&quot; was wrecked at Bolt Tail near Hope Cove on 15 February 1760. The ship&#x27;s master had mistaken their location as &quot;Ramillies&quot; approached the Devon shore, and the vessel was already within Hope Bay when the error was identified. There was a strong onshore wind and &quot;Ramillies&quot;″ captain ordered the anchors lowered to hold the vessel fast until it could turn back to open sea, but no purchase could be found on the sandy seabed and the ship continued to drift towards the coast. After several hours she struck the cliffs beneath Bolt Tail and sank; twenty-six seamen and one midshipman survived from her crew of 850 men. The sinking became the subject of a popular contemporary folk song, &quot;The Loss of the Ramillies&quot;, a version of which has been recorded by the English folk band Brass Monkey.

<doc id="1168643" wikidata="Q2164393" url="?curid=1168643" title="Stravaganza (series)">
<text>Stravaganza is a series of novels written by children&#x27;s author Mary Hoffman. The books are set alternatively between Islington, an area of London, England, and various cities in Talia, an alternate version of Renaissance Italy.

The series originally consisted of a trilogy of books: City of Masks, City of Stars, and City of Flowers. The popularity of the trilogy allowed the series to be extended for three more books: City of Secrets, City of Ships, and City of Swords.

==Inspiration and Development==
Mary Hoffman was originally inspired to write the &quot;Stravaganza&quot; series after a family trip to Venice and an incident involving a gondola ride. The subsequent books developed from the original idea. The country of Talia reflects Hoffman&#x27;s own imagining of what Italy is like. Further inspiration of the settings for each of the books came from Hoffman&#x27;s regular trips to Italy.

Though the series was intended to be a trilogy, it was later expanded into six books. For continuing the series, the fourth book in the series, &quot;City of Secrets&quot;, derived from the theme of secrets and knowledge while continuing on the open-ended plot at the end of &quot;City of Flowers&quot;, where Luciano Crinamorte is due to attend university in the city of Padavia. Each book in the series introduces a new protagonist as a &quot;Stravagante&quot;, a traveler between England and the parallel world of Talia, while maintaining previously introduced characters as part of the supporting cast.

==Setting==
The &quot;Stravaganza&quot; series is primarily set in Talia, which is based on Italy during the Renaissance in the 16th century. Most notably, the primary antagonists in the series, the di Chimici family, were inspired by the de Medici family. In the series, it is established that a number of differences exist between Talia and Italy in the 16th century in both historical, religious, and scientific ways.

The existence of Talia parallels the contemporary 21st century world of England, which serves as a secondary setting and the origin of the protagonists of each book in the series. Individuals capable of moving between worlds are known as &quot;Stravaganti&quot;; a &quot;Stravagante&quot;&#x27;s ability to move between worlds is facilitated by a talisman, an object that originally came from the world opposite to the traveler&#x27;s own world.

The country of Talia comprises twelve city-states, each which have their own equivalents in this world, and appellations referring a unique quality of the city. Half of these city-states are under the political control of members of the di Chimici family, whose strongholds lie in Giglia and in Remora, which is also home to a di Chimici Pope. The few cities which remain outside di Chimici control are either still negotiating political treaties with the di Chimici (Montemurato), or remain independent (Bellezza, Classe, Romula, Padavia, and Cittanuova).

===City-States===
==Stravaganza Publications==

===City of Masks===
Lucien Mulholland, a teenager recovering from chemotherapy, is given a red and purple marbled notebook by his father so that Lucien can write in it since Lucien&#x27;s throat hurts. When he falls asleep holding the book, he wakes up in the enchanting Bellezza, a Renaissance Venice-like city in the country of Talia (which resembles Renaissance Italy), ruled by a beautiful and imperious Duchessa. Here he meets the adventurous Arianna Gasparini and the mysterious Rodolfo Rossi. Rodolfo is a Stravagante, a traveller of a secret order who can move between Lucien&#x27;s world and Rodolfo&#x27;s by use of a talisman (an object from the other&#x27;s world). However, Bellezza for all its beauty also has many dangers, especially for those who become close to the Duchessa.

===City of Stars===
Georgia O&#x27;Grady is a girl who is frequently bullied by her stepbrother, Russell. Her only escape is to go horse riding. When she falls asleep holding a miniature winged horse figurine, she wakes up in a stable in Talia in the city of Remora (Renaissance Siena), a city divided in twelve sections for each of the signs of the western zodiac. Here, she meets the Montalbani family, which includes the Horsemaster Paolo and his son Cesare. Paolo, like Rodolfo, is a Stravagante and reveals to Georgia (who is mistaken initially for a boy and retains this as a disguise throughout the book, her name is Giorgio) that she has come at a very important time: a horse race known as the Stellata is about to take place. The Twelfth of the Ram, which holds ties to the city of Bellezza and is the twelfth of the Montalbanis, has not won the race in twenty-five years. The Twelfth place their hopes in the birth of a special horse in the Twelfth of the Ram, one that may actually bring about the luck the twelfth needs to break their losing streak.

The di Chimici family (antagonists in the first book) intend them to lose again to prove to the new Duchessa of Bellezza, Arianna Rossi (formerly Arianna Gasparini), and her father, Rodolfo, the advantages of joining their alliance by marrying Gaetano di Chimici, the homely but charming third son of the head of the family, Duke Niccolo of Giglia. Gaetano, while willing to submit to his father&#x27;s ambitions, would rather study and is more concerned about the well-being of his younger brother, Falco, who was crippled in a riding accident.

Lucien, the protagonist of the first book, now known as Luciano and living as a full-time resident of Bellezza — as well as other important supporting characters, such as Silvia (the old Duchessa), Rodolfo, and Arianna, appear again.

===City of Flowers===
Sky Meadows, a teenager whose mother is recovering from a longtime illness, is shy and reclusive, partly because he feels he needs to protect his mother, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the nerve to tell the girl he likes how he feels (mostly because she has a pair of rather familiar tough looking friends, a girl with tiger-striped red hair and the school&#x27;s fencing champion). Everything changes when Sky finds a blue perfume bottle and falls asleep with it in his hand. He awakes in Giglia (the Talian version of Florence) where the pharmacist-friar and Stravagante Sulien is waiting for him. Sky, given the name Celestino Pascoli, finds himself embroiled in a world of art and intrigue as the di Chimici family prepares for four weddings. Once again Bellezza&#x27;s young Duchessa becomes involved as she has been invited as a guest by Gaetano di Chimici, one of the grooms and a personal friend of hers, and also to commission a statue of her sculpted by the great Giuditta Miele, another Stravagante.

Meanwhile, the di Chimici family and its rival, the Nucci family, have reached a point in their age old blood feud where the flood gates are about to open.

Luciano, Arianna, Georgia, Falco di Chimici (now Nicholas Duke, foster-son of the Mulhollands), and other important characters from the previous books appear again, such as Silvia, and Rodolfo.

===City of Secrets===
The &quot;City of Secrets&quot; continues the story of Luciano and Arianna as Luciano goes to study at a university in Padavia (the Talian version of Padua). Another Stravagante from the modern world appears, a dyslexic but extremely intelligent young man named Matt, whose talisman happens to be a book. Transported to the Scriptorium of Padavia University, where Matt works as a printer of forbidden texts under the guidance of the Stravagante Constantin, who is known amongst the public as a professor of Rhetoric at the university.

During his visits, Matt meets Luciano, who is studying at the university, and Arianna, who is secretly visiting Luciano while disguised as a boy. However, insecurities regarding his ability to read puts on a strain on Matt&#x27;s life and the discovery of other Stravaganti in his world result in more trouble than Matt can deal with.

Meanwhile, the di Chimici continue their attempts to unify northern Talia under their rule and attempt to convince the ruler of Padavia to enforce new rules against occult practices that the di Chimici will hope to single out the Stravaganti. Both Matt and Luciano, who remains the object of the di Chimici grudge after the death of Duke Niccolò, find themselves in terrible peril, especially as the di Chimici are verge of making a dangerous breakthrough into the modern world.

===City of Ships===
Isabel, nicknamed &quot;Bel&quot;, is the younger twin by ten minutes and has spent her entire life in the shadow of her brother Charlie, who is naturally more talented than she is at anything and is genuinely nice. Unable to compare to her brother, Isabel avoids drawing attention to herself and concentrates on her only unique talent: art. However, when she is transported to the Talian city of Classe (the Talian version of Ravenna) with a tesserae mosaic fragment, she finds herself in a world with mosaics, pirates, and traders. As the city prepares for an attack from the Gate people from the east, Isabel finds that she is a crucial element for defending the city and realizes the opportunity to finally find her true strengths and impress her brother.

===City of Swords===
Desperately unhappy, Laura has resorted to secretly self-harming. But Laura is a Stravagante, somebody who can travel in time and space. When she finds her talisman, a small silver dagger, she stravagates with it to sixteenth-century Fortezza, a town similar to Lucca in Italy, where she meets her Stravagante, who is a swordsmith. But Laura also meets the charming and attractive Ludo, and falls for him. Their love for each other is tested when Ludo lays claim to the crown of Fortezza, and Laura finds herself fighting on the side of the Stravaganti opposing him...

A thrilling tale filled with battles on the field and battles of the heart, which finishes with a long-awaited wedding between two much loved characters.

==Characters==
Characters are grouped according to geographical association, either by the city-state they are primarily associated with or where the character&#x27;s first appearance in the series occurred.

===Bellezza===
Lucien Mulholland (&quot;Luciano Crinamorte&quot;)
: The protagonist of &quot;City of Masks&quot;, Lucien is recovering from cancer when he receives his talisman, a marbled notebook from his father. Upon traveling to Bellezza, he becomes a close friend of Arianna Gasparini and apprenticed to the Stravaganti, Rodolfo Rossi. With his arrival in the city, he soon becomes involved with more political matters relating to Silvia, the imperious Duchessa of Bellezza, whom he saves from assassination. This act later earns him the title of &quot;Cavaliere&quot;, a kind of knight. However, his involvement in Bellezza&#x27;s affairs cause him to be kidnapped for a long time (in the climax of &quot;City of Masks&quot;). As in his other world he seems to be in a coma without any brain activity, he dies there and is forced to live his whole life in Talia. He plays a key supporting role in subsequent books, and proposes to Arianna Rossi in &quot;City of Flowers&quot;.

Arianna Gasparini (&quot;Arianna Rossi&quot;)
: The heroine of the &quot;City of Masks&quot;, Arianna is a spirited and strong-willed girl who seeks adventure beyond the lagoon islands where she was raised. Known as the &quot;Figlia del’Isola&quot; (Daughter of the Island), she is supposedly the only child to be born on the island of Torrone for 20 years and has been treasured and spoiled by her family and the islanders. In &quot;City of Masks&quot;, she wishes to become a mandolier, a job only done by young men, but her plan to become one goes awry when Lucien appears in Bellezza and she is forced to discard her disguise to save his life. The two eventually become friends and she is his guide in the city. Arianna&#x27;s true heritage is later revealed when the di Chimici attempt to use her against the Duchessa; she is actually the daughter of the Duchessa and Rodolfo and was adopted by the Duchessa&#x27;s older sister, Valeria, and husband, Gianfranco, the curator of a museum on Torrone. At the end of &quot;City of Masks&quot;, she becomes the new Duchessa of Bellezza. She continues to play a key secondary role in subsequent books, eventually becoming Luciano&#x27;s fiancée, and later wife, and disguising herself as the youth &quot;Adamo&quot; while visiting Luciano at University in Padavia. She becomes engaged to Luciano in the &quot;City of Flowers&quot;.

Rodolfo Rossi
: Lucien&#x27;s master and a powerful Stravagante. Rodolfo is a well-respected and distinguished citizen of Bellezza as a scientist and Senator as well as a close confidante and lover of the Duchessa. He is kind and understanding, but can appear serious and intimidating. He has two older brothers, Fiorentino and Edigio, and is later revealed to be Arianna&#x27;s father and acts as her regent when she becomes Duchessa. Rodolfo plays a key supporting role in all the Stravaganza books.

Silvia Bellini (&quot;Silvia Rossi&quot;)
: The beautiful and imperious Duchessa of Bellezza for twenty-five years. Beloved by all of Bellezza, she is extremely strong willed, dangerous to her enemies, and loyal to her friends. While she has had a number of lovers in her life, she takes a shine to Rodolfo and sends him to university; when he returned an established scholar, he becomes her sole lover and the father of her secret child, Arianna, though he did not find out about her for fifteen years. After a near successful assassination attempt, Silvia decides not to reveal the truth and arranges for her daughter to become her successor. She moves to Padavia under the guise of a wealthy widow and lives with her loyal maid, Susanna, and a devoted reformed assassin, Guido Parola. She visits Rodolfo and Arianna whenever she has a chance and plays a supporting role in the &quot;City of Stars&quot; and &quot;City of Flowers&quot;; she eventually openly marries Rodolfo and returns to Bellezza as Arianna&#x27;s stepmother, continuing to advise her daughter on statecraft.

William Dethridge (&quot;Gugliemo Crinamorte&quot;)
: The first Stravagante, an alchemist from the Elizabethan era. He first arrived in Bellona, but relocated to Montemurato when he &quot;translated&quot; and then to Bellezza. Eventually becomes foster-father to Luciano and marries Leonora Gasparini, the widowed sister-in-law of Arianna&#x27;s adopted father Gianfranco. In Talia, he is an astronomer and natural philosopher.

Leonora Gasparini (&quot;Leonora Crinamorte&quot;)
: Arianna&#x27;s aunt, the widowed sister-in-law of Arianna&#x27;s foster father, Gianfranco. After Arianna&#x27;s failed attempt to become a mandolier, her foster-parents send her to live with Leonora in hopes of satisfying Arianna&#x27;s desire to live in Bellezza. Leonora marries Dr. Dethridge at the end of &quot;City of Masks&quot; and becomes Luciano&#x27;s foster mother.

===Remora===
Georgia O&#x27;Grady
: The protagonist of &quot;City of Stars&quot;, Georgia is a withdrawn girl who lives with her mother Maura, stepfather Ralph, and an abusive stepbrother Russell. She loves riding horses and obtains a small winged horse sculpture from an antique shop, which turns out to be a talisman. She arrives in the city of Remora and becomes involved in the Stellata, a significant horse race, as well as developing a complicated friendship with Falco di Chimici, a crippled prince of the most powerful family in Talia. Because of her unfeminine features, Georgia is mistaken as a boy and ends up accepting the name &quot;Giorgio Gredi&quot; as a disguise in Talia. She plays a supporting role in subsequent books, becoming more confident and taking on a more feminine appearance.

Paolo Montalbani
: The Horsemaster for the Twelfth of the Ram in Remora, Paolo is Stravagante in Remora. He is the last victorious winner of the Stellata from the Twelfth of the Ram. He is Cesare&#x27;s father and is married to Teresa and the father of three little girls and twin boys with her. In addition to becoming Georgia&#x27;s mentor, he becomes a surrogate father-figure and tries to help her with her troubling family situation.

Cesare Montalbani
: The oldest son of the horsemaster of the Twelfth of the Ram in Remora, Cesare is not a Stravagante, though is aware of their existence. A humble and passionate young man who is fond of his stepmother and half-siblings, he becomes Georgia&#x27;s guide to Remora and becomes quite fond of her. A superb horseman, he is the rider chosen by the Twelfth to compete in the Stellata and carries all of the Ram&#x27;s hopes for a victory after nearly twenty years. He eventually attends university in Padavia with Luciano.

Falco di Chimici (&quot;Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Duke&quot;)
: The youngest son of Niccolò di Chimici, the current head of the di Chimici family. Due to a riding accident, his legs were mangled, which is a source of unhappiness for him and his family. With help from Georgia and Luciano, Falco permanently translates into Georgia&#x27;s world to obtain medical attention. He becomes the foster-son of Luciano&#x27;s parents, Vicky and David Mulholland, under the identity of Nicholas Duke. Though he thrives in the modern world, his relationship with Georgia and feeling of displacement results in homesickness and a reckless desire to return to Talia.

Gaetano di Chimici
: The third son of Niccolò di Chimici, who was originally ordered to court Arianna Rossi. He is not handsome, but is kind, charming, unambitious and is more interested in becoming a scholar. He cares deeply for his younger brother Falco and becomes a trusted friend of the Stravaganti and the Duchessa of Bellezza. He is the only member of the di Chimici family to know the truth behind his younger brother&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;. Gaetano loves his cousin, Francesca of Bellona, who he eventually proposes to and marries. After the death of his older brother Carlo, Gaetano becomes heir to the title of Prince of Remora.

Ferdinando di Chimici (&quot;Pope Lenient VI&quot;)
: The younger brother of Duke Niccolò, Ferdinando is Pope Lenient VI and also the current Prince of Remora. Unlike his brother, he is good man but is generally weak-willed and defers to his brother&#x27;s commands. He is not ambitious and tries to uphold his position as the head of the Reman Church with appropriate honour, though he does indulge somewhat in the comfort his position brings and enjoys debating theology with his cardinals.

===Giglia===
Sky Meadows
: The protagonist of &quot;City of Flowers&quot;, Sky is the quiet biracial son of Rosalind, an aromatherapist single mother recovering from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, and black rock singer Rainbow Warrior. After acquiring a small perfume bottle as a talisman, he is transported to Giglia, the political stronghold of the di Chimici family, during a series of weddings for the illustrious clan at which Arianna, as the new Duchessa of Bellezza, is an honoured guest. He is entangled in a series of complex relationships both in and out of Talia, particularly issues regarding his absentee father. In Talia, Sky is known as &quot;Celestino Pascoli&quot;, less formally &quot;Brother Tino&quot;, as he adopts a disguise of a Franciscan novice monk and begins to show a strong interest in art.

Niccolò di Chimici
: Introduced in &quot;City of Stars&quot; and the main antagonist of &quot;City of Stars&quot; and &quot;City of Flowers&quot;, Niccolò di Chimici is the duke of Giglia and older brother of Ferdinando di Chimici, the Prince of Remora and Pope Lenient VI. He is the father of four sons, Fabrizio, Carlo, Gaetano, and Falco, and one daughter, Beatrice. Like Silvia Bellini, he is kind and loyal to his friends and family, but dangerous to his enemies. An ambitious and ruthless man, he seeks to unite all the city states of northern Talia under di Chimici rule. The loss of his son Falco drives him even more to attempt to gain control over Bellezza and crush the Stravaganti, whom he believes are responsible for Falco&#x27;s death. He is killed by Luciano in a duel in &quot;City of Flowers&quot;.

Sandro
: Sky&#x27;s guide to Giglia, an orphan boy raised in the streets and an apprentice to Enrico Poggi. He adopts a mongrel dog he names &quot;Fratello&quot; (Talian for &quot;Brother&quot;). Though he initially aids both the Stravaganti and the di Chimici, Sandro becomes frightened and disconcerted when he witnesses Carlo di Chimici kill Davide Nucci. He gradually spends more time with Brother Sulien instead of Enrico, viewing Sulien as a father figure, and becomes a novice at the Church of St. Mary-among-the-Vines.

Sulien Fabriano
: Fratello Sulieno Fabriano, or Brother Sulien, the pharmacist-friar of the Church of St. Mary-among-the-Vines in Giglia. A Dominican black monk who runs the church&#x27;s pharmacy, he is an expert on both medicine and poisons. He is Sky&#x27;s mentor in Giglia, and also becomes a father figure to Sandro. Like Giuditta Miele, he is a resident Stravagante of Giglia.

Giuditta Miele
: A skilled and respected sculptor in Giglia, commissioned to create a statue of the young Duchessa of Bellezza. She is also a Stravagante and becomes a confidante of sorts to Arianna Rossi during Arianna&#x27;s stay in Giglia. As an artist, she recognizes Sky&#x27;s interest and potential in art and encourages him, becoming a mentor to Sky alongside Sulien. Giuditta is a descendant of Girolamo Miele, one of the greatest architects in all of Talia and the older brother of Donato Miele, the sculptor of the bronze Sugar Fox statue in Padavia.

Fabrizio di Chimici
:Introduced in &quot;City of Stars&quot;, Fabrizio is Duke Niccolò&#x27;s eldest son and heir to the titles of Duke of Giglia and Grand-Duke of Tuschia. He shares his father&#x27;s political ambitions, but his youth and inexperience mean that he has not earned the respect of the followers of the di Chimici family. Fabrizio is utterly driven to avenge his father&#x27;s death and learn the secrets of the Stravaganti, and is disappointed that Gaetano and Beatrice do not support him in this respect. Like his father, he loves his family deeply; he is devastated by the deaths of his brothers and is extremely loving towards his wife, Caterina of Volana, and their infant son, Falco Niccolò Carlo, affectionately nicknamed &quot;Bino.&quot;

===Padavia===
Matt Wood
: The protagonist of &quot;City of Secrets&quot;, Matt is intelligent and well liked by his friends and family, but as a result of dyslexia, he feels shy about expressing himself and insecure about his relationship with his girlfriend Ayesha. When he buys a strange book from an antique shop, he arrives in Padavia, a city independent of the di Chimici family but has chosen to enact laws forbidding the occult. Though guided by Professor Constantin and Luciano, Matt becomes involved in several plots regarding forbidden magic and must save the lives of people who become implicated. In Talia, Matt is referred to as &quot;Matteo Bosco&quot; and works as a printer&#x27;s apprentice. His dyslexia disappears when he is in Talia. Matt&#x27;s mother, Jan Wood, is the English teacher at Barnsbury Comprehensive.

Professore Constantin
: A professor at the Scriptorium at University of Padavia, Constantin is not native to Talia, though is a Stravagante and student of Dr. Dethridge like the other Stravaganti. He becomes Matt&#x27;s mentor as well as Luciano&#x27;s lecturer in rhetoric. In addition, Constantin is a printer and secretly prints banned books on topics including the occult in a secret scriptorium in Padavia.

===Classe===
Isabel Evans
:The protagonist of &quot;City of Ships&quot;, Isabel tries hard to be unnoticeable so she is never compared to her older twin brother, Charlie, but often feels even worse because she winds up being forgotten. She has a strong interest in art, one of the few areas her brother is not interested in, and is transported to Classe after she finds a red velvet bag of silver tesserae. As a Stravagante, Isabel becomes more confident through her adventures in Talia and from being supported by a new group of friends, especially as she grows closer to Sky, whom she takes an interest in. However, her newfound sense of self is tested as she becomes a critical individual in saving the city of Classe from an alliance between the di Chimici and the Gate people. Notably, Isabel is the first Stravagante to use one talisman to travel to different cities in Talia, thanks to the efforts of Dr. Dethridge. While nicknamed &quot;Bel&quot; by her friends in London, Isabel is referred to as &quot;Isabella&quot; in Talia.

Flavia
:A respected and wealthy trader and merchant in city of Classe, as well as a Stravagante. She is Isabel&#x27;s mentor and is well-connected to numerous figures in Classe, including the noble Duke Germano and the mosaic-maker Fausto Ventura. As a trader, Flavia is the owner of the &quot;Silver Lady&quot;, a merchant ship, and trades many exotic goods, including spices, silk, and silver tesserae for the mosaics Classe is renowned for. While she is an insightful woman, Flavia has a strained relationship with her son, Andrea.

Andrea
:Flavia&#x27;s son, a pirate. He takes an instant liking to Isabel, often calling her &quot;Bella Isabella&quot;, though has an unfortunate habit of abducting her whenever they meet. His strained relationship with Flavia is the result of Andrea&#x27;s own disgust at Flavia&#x27;s abusive husband, a man that haunts Andrea as the person he recognizes as his father. A daring man apparently indifferent to danger, he works as a double agent for Classe, pretending to ally himself with the Gate people in order to learn their secrets and then reveal them to Flavia and Germano.

Filippo Nucci
:The only surviving son of Matteo and Graziella Nucci, whose family once lived in Giglia and were the di Chimici&#x27;s greatest rivals. Since the family&#x27;s exile to Classe, Filippo has become restless in hopes of finding a useful profession and does not wish to become a banker like his father. After a brief stint as a mosaic designer under Fausto Ventura, Duke Germano eventually delegates him to become a diplomat to Bellezza. Though he bears painful injuries from the massacre during the di Chimici weddings in &quot;City of Flowers&quot;, he holds no resentment towards the di Chimici family and retains strong feelings for Beatrice di Chimici.

Beatrice di Chimici
:The only daughter of Niccolò di Chimici, Beatrice is the Principessa of Giglia, a gentle and capable young woman who wants her family and others to live peacefully rather than become obsessed with ambitious intrigues and vendettas. While her brothers are married off, she is initially content to remain by her father&#x27;s side until his unexpected death. With her brother Fabrizio&#x27;s growing desire to avenge Niccolò and learn the secrets of the Stravaganti, Beatrice becomes disconcerted, despite the love she has for her family. She is eventually pushed to the brink at Fabrizio&#x27;s desperate plea for her to marry her cousin Filippo of Bellona and she flees to Bellezza, where she finds an ally in Arianna Rossi and the Stravaganti and her relationship with Filippo Nucci is gradually renewed.

Germano Mariano
:The elected Duke of Classe, a respected and honourable man who has ruled over Classe for many years and is well loved by his citizens. He and his wife, Anna, have several children, though they are grown and show little interest in politics. His city and Bellezza have strong ties, not only as cities independent from di Chimici rule but also as coastal cities. With an impending threat of invasion from the Gate people by sea and the di Chimici army by land, Germano is left in a difficult position and wants to protect Talia and his city from impending destruction. However, despite the chaos around him, he continues to help others, such as Filippo Nucci and Andrea, to find their place in the world.

: A swordsmith from Fortezza and its Stravagante, who becomes Laura&#x27;s mentor. However, with the city embroiled in a civil war and besieged by the di Chimici family attempting to restore Princess Lucia&#x27;s rule over the city, Fabio soon finds himself preoccupied with forging weapons for the rebel army.

Ludovico Vivoide
: A cousin of Aurelio and Raffaella Vivoide, Ludovico (Ludo) is only half-Manoush; unlike most Manoush, who have dark hair, Ludo stands out with his red hair, which is a result of his mixed heritage. His father is supposedly a di Chimici, though he does not know who. His arrival in Padavia comes at the most inconvenient time, when the Governor has banned the occult, including the practices of the Manoush. He rejoins his cousins in Classe, perceptively observing that Isabel is more than she appears. In &quot;City of Swords&quot;, he challenges Lucia&#x27;s claim for the crown of Fortezza, revealing himself as the illegitimate son of Prince Jacopo. However, when his claim is rejected by the governing council, he joins the faction opposed to a woman ruling Fortezza and besiege the Princess and her supporters.

He is noble by birth, but his family&#x27;s fortune has been squandered away by his estranged older brother and his father has become ill; he reluctantly agreed to assassinate Silvia out of desperation for money to treat his father. When the Duchessa secretly pardons him, Guido becomes her loyal servant and bodyguard until he risks his life to save Arianna in &quot;City of Flowers&quot;.

During &quot;City of Swords&quot;, he becomes Lucia&#x27;s most loyal protector and develops a strong relationship with her.

Jacopo the Elder
: The Prince of Fortezza, the father of Princess Lucia and Bianca, the Duchessa of Volana. He is known as a kind man who loves his daughters dearly and willingly worked alongside Rodolfo Rossi to bring food and warmth to victims of the floods in &quot;City of Flowers&quot;.

During his second attempt on Silvia&#x27;s life, he unwittingly kills his fiancée, Giuliana, who is being used as a double for the Duchessa at the time. The mysterious circumstances of her disappearance haunt him until he realizes that he was responsible for her death as a result of working for the di Chimici. He abruptly ends his service with the di Chimici family and forces his help upon Luciano and the other Stravaganti.

Rinaldo di Chimici
:Introduced as a diplomat from the di Chimici to Bellezza, Rinaldo is a humourless and physically unattractive man delegated by the head of the family to persuade Silvia, the Duchessa of Bellezza, to join in an alliance with the di Chimici. After multiple diplomatic attempts fail, Rinaldo resorts to underhanded tactics including murder and kidnapping to secure Bellezza, which also fail. He subsequently leaves Bellezza and is eventually assigned to become chaplain to his uncle, Pope Lenient VI, and quickly rises to the rank of Cardinal. However, he remains ambitious and underhanded, seeking to learn the secrets of the Stravaganti. Rinaldo is the younger brother of Duke Alfonso of Volana and the older brother of Caterina, the wife of Fabrizio di Chimici.

Francesca di Chimici

:Lucien&#x27;s parents. Vicky is a violin teacher; her son plays the violin in the orchestra and Georgia is one of Vicky&#x27;s students. David salvages architectural features from houses. After Lucien and Falco&#x27;s respective translations, the Mulhollands become Nicholas&#x27;s foster parents and consider him as a second son. The Mulhollands eventually learn that Lucien is alive in Talia; the revelation is particularly jarring for Vicky, who continues to mourn her son. Vicky is friends with Jan Wood, Matt&#x27;s mother, and Celia Jones, the mother of Ayesha&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Jago.

Alice Greaves
: Sky&#x27;s girlfriend and Georgia&#x27;s best friend. She is, technically, a Stravagante, but only traveled to Talia once, to prove to herself that it existed. Her father, awkwardly enough, is involved with Sky&#x27;s mother. Unlike most of the other Barnsbury students, she is uncomfortable with Stravagation and views her friends&#x27; parallel world adventures with distaste, which gradually drives a wedge in her relationships with Sky and Georgia.

Mortimer Goldsmith

Charlie Evans
:Isabel&#x27;s older twin brother, a genuinely good and kind person who excels in a numerous areas, such as swimming.

His concerns culminate in an accidental Stravagation to Classe with Isabel&#x27;s talisman and a near disastrous failed attempt for them both to return to their own world. However, the incident leaves Charlie impressed with Isabel&#x27;s resolve and ability and he chooses to support her, though his own stravagation has left him with little interest in returning to Talia.

<doc id="1168651" wikidata="Q333815" url="?curid=1168651" title="Daniel Gooch">
<text>Sir Daniel Gooch, 1st Baronet (24 August 1816 – 15 October 1889) was an English railway locomotive and transatlantic cable engineer. He was the first Superintendent of Locomotive Engines on the Great Western Railway from 1837 to 1864 and its chairman from 1865 until his death in 1889.

Between 1865 and 1885 Gooch was Conservative MP for Cricklade.

==Early life==
Gooch was born in Bedlington, Northumberland, the son of John Gooch, an iron founder, and his wife, Anna Longridge. In 1831 his family moved to Tredegar Ironworks, Monmouthshire, South Wales, where his father had accepted a managerial post, and it was there that Daniel would begin training under Thomas Ellis senior, who together with Ironmaster Samuel Homfray and Richard Trevithick pioneered steam railway locomotion. Gooch wrote in his diaries &quot;Large works of this kind are by far the best school for a young engineer to get a general knowledge of what he needs in after life.&quot; and &quot;...I look back upon the time spent at Tredegar as by far the most important years of my life...&quot;.

He trained in engineering with a variety of companies, including a period with Robert Stephenson and Company, in Newcastle upon Tyne, as a draughtsman. At the age of 20 he was recruited by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Railway, under the title &quot;Superintendent of Locomotive Engines&quot;, taking office on 18 August 1837.

While working in Newcastle he met his future wife, Margaret Tanner, the daughter of Henry Tanner, a Sunderland shipowner. He stayed in touch with Margaret when he moved south to work for Brunel.

==Railway engineer==
In Gooch&#x27;s earliest days with the Great Western Railway, he struggled to keep the miscellaneous collection of broad gauge steam locomotives previously ordered by Brunel in working order. When working at Robert Stephenson and Company, he had helped design two gauge locomotives for the New Orleans Railway, which had never been delivered. Gooch persuaded Brunel to buy the two locomotives, North Star and Morning Star, and had Stephenson convert them to gauge before delivery.

As the only reliable locomotives that the company had at that time, they were the basis of the GWR Star Class. He and Brunel improved the blastpipe arrangement of the North Star to improve its fuel efficiency. Eventually Gooch moved on from the Star class and designed the new GWR Firefly Class of 2-2-2 express passenger locomotives, introduced in 1840.

In comparative trials by the Gauge Commissioners, &quot;Ixion&quot; of this class proved capable of speeds greater than its challenger. In 1843 Gooch introduced a new form of locomotive valve gear.

In 1840, Gooch was responsible for identifying the site of Swindon Works and in 1846 for designing the first complete locomotive to be constructed there, &quot;Great Western&quot;, prototype of the GWR Iron Duke Class of 4-2-2 locomotives, which were able to achieve . Much renewed, they lasted to the end of the GWR broad gauge era.

Although Gooch&#x27;s locomotives were principally for the broad gauge, between 1854 and 1864 he also had to design a number of standard gauge classes for the GWR&#x27;s new Northern Division. At the end of September 1864, he resigned from his post of Locomotive Superintendent, though he continued as a member of the GWR Board.

==Cable engineer and other roles==
From 1859, Gooch lived at Clewer Park in Windsor and was a Deputy Lieutenant for Berkshire. 

In 1865, he was recalled to the Great Western Railway Company as chairman, replacing Richard Potter in November 1865; he remained chairman until his death in October 1889, when F.G. Saunders was elected to succeed him. He was also chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. 

In this role, he was instrumental in laying the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable, using the (1865/66). On completion of the cable, on 27 July 1866, Gooch, who was on the &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, sent a cable message to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Stanley, saying &quot;Perfect communication established between England and America; God grant it will be a lasting source of benefit to our country.&quot;

==Political career==
In 1865, while out of the country laying the cable, Gooch was elected Conservative MP for Cricklade. He held the seat until 1885. During his time as MP, he never addressed Parliament; he noted this in his diary when Parliament was dissolved on 18 November 1885 with the comment &lt;q&gt;It would be a great advantage to business if there were a greater number who followed my example.&lt;/q&gt;

==Later business activities==
In 1866 Gooch was created a baronet in recognition of his cable work. 

In 1868, he became chairman of the Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company after John Pender, the first chairman, resigned. He led the Great Western Railway out of near-bankruptcy and took a particular interest in construction of the Severn Tunnel. Final abandonment of the broad gauge did not take place until after his death at the age of 73.

From 1850 on he was an active Freemason, holding office and founding a number of Lodges.

==Family==
Gooch married Margaret Tanner in 1838; they had six children: Anna (1839), Emily (1849), Henry (1841), Charles (1845), Alfred (1846) and Frank (1847). Following Margaret&#x27;s death in 1868, he married Emily Burder in 1870; she died in 1901. 

His elder brothers, Thomas, John, and younger brother William, were also railway engineers. His grandson, also named Daniel, briefly served as dog handler on Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.

==Legacy==

GWR Castle Class steam locomotive no. 5070 and British Rail Western Region class 47 diesel locomotive no. D1663 (later 47078, then 47628) were both named &quot;Sir Daniel Gooch&quot;. Continuing with this tradition, the present Great Western Railway company has named class 800 no. 800004 after Gooch; it runs on the line that Gooch helped to create.

A pub in Bayswater, London was named the Daniel Gooch; it closed in 2016. The Sir Daniel Arms, a Wetherspoons pub in Swindon, is also named after Gooch, as is Gooch Street in the same town, one of several streets built to house Great Western railway workers.

<text>In mathematics, the Tamagawa number formula_1 of a semisimple algebraic group defined over a global field is the measure of formula_2, where formula_3 is the adele ring of . Tamagawa numbers were introduced by , and named after him by .

Tsuneo Tamagawa&#x27;s observation was that, starting from an invariant differential form ω on , defined over , the measure involved was well-defined: while could be replaced by with a non-zero element of formula_4, the product formula for valuations in is reflected by the independence from of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for semisimple groups contains important parts of classical quadratic form theory.

==Definition==
Let be a global field, its ring of adeles, and a semisimple algebraic group defined over .

Choose Haar measures on the completions such that has volume 1 for all but finitely many places . These then induce a Haar measure on , which we further assume is normalized so that has volume 1 with respect to the induced quotient measure.
The Tamagawa measure on the adelic algebraic group is now defined as follows. Take a left-invariant -form on defined over , where is the dimension of . This, together with the above choices of Haar measure on the , induces Haar measures on for all places of . As is semisimple, the product of these measures yields a Haar measure on , called the &quot;Tamagawa measure&quot;. The Tamagawa measure does not depend on the choice of ω, nor on the choice of measures on the , because multiplying by an element of multiplies the Haar measure on by 1, using the product formula for valuations.

The Tamagawa number is defined to be the Tamagawa measure of .

==Weil&#x27;s conjecture on Tamagawa numbers==

&quot;Weil&#x27;s conjecture on Tamagawa numbers&quot; states that the Tamagawa number of a simply connected (i.e. not having a proper &quot;algebraic&quot; covering) simple algebraic group defined over a number field is 1. calculated the Tamagawa number in many cases of classical groups and observed that it is an integer in all considered cases and that it was equal to 1 in the cases when the group is simply connected. found examples where the Tamagawa numbers are not integers, but the conjecture about the Tamagawa number of simply connected groups was proven in general by several works culminating in a paper by and for the analogue over function fields over finite fields by .

<doc id="1168655" wikidata="Q7789593" url="?curid=1168655" title="Thomas Finneran">
<text>Thomas Michael &quot;Tom&quot; Finneran (born January 27, 1950), is a radio talk host and former Massachusetts Democratic politician who served as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from April 1996 to September 2004. He represented the district that included parts of the Boston neighborhoods of Dorchester, Mattapan and Hyde Park as well as parts of the town of Milton for 26 years.

He resigned and accepted the position of President of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. He subsequently resigned in 2007 after pleading guilty to criminal obstruction of justice, in a court case about his testimony about his influence and participation in the redistricting process following the 2000 census. He was disbarred in 2010 (retroactive to January 23, 2007). From February 2007 to May 2012, he co-hosted a talk radio morning drive slot with WRKO.

== Early life and family ==
Finneran&#x27;s parents were William, a carpet cleaner, and his wife Mary (b. 1920). He is the fourth of seven children (five brothers and two sisters). He and his wife Donna (&quot;née&quot; Kelley) have two daughters, Kelley and Shannon F. Mahoney of Milton, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School, graduated from Northeastern University in 1973 with a BA in business administration and finance, and received his JD from Boston College Law School.

== Massachusetts House of Representatives ==
Finneran was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1978. He became the 83rd Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1996, when he defeated Democratic Majority Leader Richard Voke, the favorite to win, by obtaining all 35 votes of the Republican caucus as well as 56 of 121 Democratic votes (91 of 158 votes in total).

As Speaker, he was known for his fiscal conservatism; he insisted on balanced budgets, and created that state&#x27;s &quot;rainy day fund.&quot; He was also known for having somewhat more conservative positions on some social issues than most Massachusetts Democrats, and for his autocratic leadership style, which earned him the nickname &quot;King Tom&quot; from some detractors. In his 2001 redistricting proposal, some believed that he attempted to strike back against some of his critics by trying to eliminate their districts. For example, his initial proposal would have combined Newton&#x27;s two main House districts and would have forced incumbent Representatives Kay Khan and Ruth Balser to run against each other. Both Khan and Balser were vocal opponents of Finneran, and it was only after the protests of many women&#x27;s advocacy groups that Finneran relented.

== Legislative redistricting and court case ==
After the 2000 U.S. census, in 2001 the Massachusetts House, under Finneran&#x27;s leadership, drew up new House districts. The redistricting was challenged in Federal court, in a civil case, by the Black Political Task Force and others, as unfair to minority voters by constructing districts intended to favor white incumbents to the detriment of candidates preferred by blacks. In 2004, a three-judge Federal Court panel held that the redistricting plan violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by discriminating against black voters. It held that 17 Massachusetts House districts were enjoined from being used in the 2004 election, that the legislature was given six weeks to create an acceptable plan for the districts, and the plaintiff Black Political Task Force could comment on proposed districts before being approved by the Court. In a footnote to the decision, the court criticized Finneran, implying that he misled the court when he testified that he had little involvement in the redistricting process. The court said &quot;Although Speaker Finneran denied any involvement in the redistricting process, the circumstantial evidence strongly suggests the opposite conclusion.&quot; Finneran&#x27;s attorney, Egbert, claimed that the statement was &quot;simply wrong.&quot; (Under state law and House rules, Finneran was free to participate in drafting the legislative map before it was released.) Federal prosecutors indicted Finneran in June 2005 in a criminal case, charging him with perjury and obstruction of justice for misrepresenting his participation in the redistricting process. The indictment cited eight meetings that he held about redistricting.

== Obstruction of justice in legislative redistricting case ==

On January 5, 2007, prior to the start of the scheduled criminal trial Finneran pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice in exchange for federal prosecutors&#x27; dropping perjury charges against him; the plea bargain allowed him to avoid jail time. Federal prosecutors and lawyers for Finneran recommended that the once-powerful figure on Beacon Hill receive 18 months of unsupervised probation and a $25,000 fine. In return, Finneran agreed not to run for any elected political position in state, federal or municipal government for five years after his sentencing date. The US Attorney&#x27;s office agreed to dismiss three counts of perjury against Finneran.

On November 14, 2003, he made misleading and false statements under oath in US District Court, according to the agreement. The seven-page document, signed by Finneran on January 3, 2007, states, &quot;Defendant expressly and unequivocally admits that he committed the crime so charged in the indictment, and that he is in fact guilty of the offense so charged in the indictment.&quot; Finneran faced 16 to 21 months in prison if he was convicted on all counts stemming from criminal charges that he misrepresented his role in the creation of a legislative redistricting map that diluted the clout of minority voters. Finneran lost his $30,000-a-year pension after his plea. A decision in 2006 by the state Supreme Judicial Court permitted a pension to be revoked in a similar case of breach of public trust. His attorney, Richard Egbert, has said Finneran never claimed he was totally uninvolved in the redistricting process and that he acknowledged in his testimony having about &quot;half a dozen&quot; conversations with leaders of the redistricting committee.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Retirement Board voted in October 2012, that Finneran was not entitled to a government pension of about $32,900 a year due to his conviction of obstruction of justice in 2007. Finneran appealed the Retirement Board decision to the Boston Municipal Court where a judge reversed the Board&#x27;s decision, concluding that Finneran&#x27;s conviction did not bear &quot;a direct factual link to his position as a House Member and/or Speaker[.]&quot; On April 5, 2017, the Supreme Judicial Court reversed that decision and reinstated the decision of the Retirement Board, holding that &quot;[s]imply put, it is only because
he had been Speaker of the House at the relevant time that he
was in a position to testify as to the genesis of the
redistricting plan and to do so falsely. This connection is
enough to warrant forfeiture&quot; under the relevant Massachusetts statute, General Law c. 32, § 15(4).

As the result of Finneran&#x27;s criminal convictions, he was also disbarred (license to practice law revoked) by the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers.

== President of Massachusetts Biotechnology Council ==
Finneran served as president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council since he resigned from the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 2004 until January 8, 2007. The council is a non-profit organization with more than 500 corporate and academic members, promoting, and supporting the state&#x27;s biotechnology industry. It has been observed that Finneran&#x27;s value to the council has been primarily to be out of office, as Finneran was a vigorous and powerful opponent of stem cell research and repeatedly blocked legislative efforts to support stem cell research in Massachusetts. Finneran&#x27;s reported salary was $416,000 a year. On January 8, 2007, less than a week after the plea agreement, Finneran resigned from Biotechnology Council; the council unanimously accepted his resignation. Finneran had been praised as a highly effective lobbyist; his resignation permitted an internal debate about having a felon for the council&#x27;s president to end.

==Later life==
On March 9, 2009, by a vote of 11 to 1, the state Board of Bar Overseers recommended that former House Speaker and WRKO radio host Thomas M. Finneran be disbarred for his conviction on a federal charge of obstruction of justice. On January 11, 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court revoked Finneran&#x27;s license to practice law in the Commonwealth, rejecting an alternative penalty proposed by Finneran&#x27;s lawyer of a two-year license suspension. His disbarment was retroactive to January 23, 2007 (the date on which he was suspended).

On January 11, 2007, Finneran was announced as the morning drive-time host on the Boston WRKO radio station, replacing Scott Allen Miller. On Tuesday May 28, 2012 it was announced that Tom Finneran will end his radio career at Entercom Communications WRKO in Boston, effective Thursday May 31, 2012 (his last broadcast date). In a statement, Finneran said he was not able to keep up with the hours to host a well-informed show.

On March 5, 2017, the state&#x27;s highest court has ruled that former Speaker of the House Tom Finneran has to forfeit his pension, ending a years-long battle the former pol waged to keep his $33,000-a-year benefit. The Supreme Judicial Court overturned a district court order, ruling that Finneran&#x27;s conviction for providing false testimony in a federal civil suit over the House&#x27;s redistricting plan was directly linked to his job as speaker. That connection, the court decided, meant the State Retirement Board was right in stripping him of his annual pension. Finneran pleaded guilty in 2007 to one count of obstruction of justice. &quot;Finneran&#x27;s conduct falls squarely within ... requiring forfeiture where there is a direct factual link between the public employee&#x27;s position and the offense,&quot; the court wrote. &quot;Finneran&#x27;s false testimony concerning his knowledge of and participation in the redistricting planning process is in at least two respects directly linked as a factual matter to his position as Speaker of the House.&quot; Finneran&#x27;s pension is valued at about $470,000, according to court papers, including $240,000 the state would have owed him if the SJC upheld the district court order.

<text>John Viret Gooch FRSA (29 June 1812 – 8 June 1900) was the locomotive superintendent of the London and South Western Railway from 1841 to 1850. Born at Bedlington, Northumberland, John Viret Gooch (elder brother of Daniel Gooch) was the second son of John and Anna (born Longridge).

==Career==

===Grand Junction Railway===
He became the pupil of Joseph Locke during the construction of the Grand Junction Railway and he became the resident engineer after that line opened.

===Manchester and Leeds Railway===
In 1840 he joined his older brother Thomas Longridge Gooch on the Manchester and Leeds Railway.

===London and South Western Railway===
Gooch was recommended to the LSWR by Locke and appointed locomotive superintendent on 1 January 1841. Officially Locke remained in charge of the department.

;LSWR locomotives
Initially locomotives were purchased from a wide range of private manufacturers such as Edward Bury and Company and Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company. From Jan 1843 the LSWR&#x27;s own Nine Elms Locomotive Works started production with the &#x27;Eagle&#x27; class singles. Gooch&#x27;s designs included a number of singles and the &#x27;Bison&#x27; class 0-6-0 goods.

===Eastern Counties Railway===
After leaving the LSWR in 1850, Gooch was appointed to the post of Locomotive Superintendent to the Eastern Counties Railway. On appointment he was given a free hand by chairman Edward Ladd Betts to reduce working costs of which he would receive 2.5% of any savings made. Unfortunately there were no checks and balances in place (and nor was the move minuted), so Viret would tell the accountant what he had saved and receive his payment. The main target of his costs were the engine drivers where he would sack men and then offer them their own jobs back at a lower rate, and deduct money from their wages for late running or mechanical failure.

Betts was succeeded as chairman by David Waddington in 1851, who made himself responsible for the ECR stores committee. Gooch made an agreement with the Norfolk and Eastern Counties Coal Company which was partnership of coal merchant E and A Prior David Waddington, Samuel Morton Peto and Gooch, where they would pay him 3d (3 old UK pennies) per ton purchased. Viret would then sell some of the ECR coal on for further personal gain.

On 12 August 178 drivers, firemen and fitters handed in their notices, sick of the injustices and financial penalties being inflicted on them and in the hope that Gooch would be forced to resign. The board backed Gooch and the 178 men were blacklisted from future railway employment with replacement staff being recruited from other railway companies.

Gooch stayed at the ECR until 1856 when the shareholders finally worked out what was going on and both he and Waddington did not have their contracts renewed. At this point, he would only have been aged 44 and according to his obituary printed in the journal of the Institution of Civil Engineers &quot;he did little practical work during the past forty years, enjoying country life in his Berkshire home&quot;.

====ECR locomotives====
Under Viret&#x27;s tenure at the ECR six classes of locomotive were introduced including the first locomotive actually built at Stratford Works in 1851. The classes were as follows:

==Shipping Interests==
Gooch had interest in six ships (all colliers) and he was guilty of using ECR facilities at Lowestoft to repair his own ships.

The six ships were:

* Lady Berriedale - built John Scott Russell London in 1853, sunk 1868.
* The Eagle - built John Scott Russell in 1853, sunk 1870
* The Falcon (1)- built John Scott Russell in 1853 - wrecked off Lesbos in 1856 on its return from the Crimean War
* The Hawk - built John Scott Russell in 1854 - lost in a gale off Southwold in 1862
* The Vulcan - built James Laing, Sunderland in 1856. Sold August 1886 to Captain Edward Jenkins of Cardiff and sunk in Carbis Bay in 1894
* The Falcon (2) - built M Samuelson and Sons, Hull in 1862, but lost at sea in 1868 off Spain.

He was also a director for The Australian Auxiliary Steam Clipper Company, Ltd.

== Mining interests ==
He was a director for several mining companies including:
* Copper Queen United, Ltd.
* La Trinidad, Ltd.
* Mounts Bay Consols, Ltd.
* Tresavean Mines, Ltd.

==Family==
J. V. Gooch was married twice. First, in June 1840, to Hannah Frances Handcock, daughter of Captain Elias Robinson Handcock. Secondly, on 16 March 1876, to Emily Mary Stonhouse, daughter of Reverend Charles Stonhouse. J. V. Gooch lived at Cooper&#x27;s Hill, Bracknell, Berkshire.

His eldest child from his second marriage, Mabel Barbara, who was born in 1877. His son was Edward Sinclair Gooch (1879-1915) who was a major in the Berkshire Yeomanry and killed in World War 1. He also had a second daughter named Ethel Mary who was born in 1882.

<text>Cornelius Brown (5 March 1852 in Lowdham, Nottinghamshire – 4 November 1907) was an English journalist and historian. In 1874, 22-year-old Brown became editor of the Newark Advertiser in nearby Newark-on-Trent. Over the next 33 years, he wrote seven major books, including a two-volume &quot;History of Newark&quot;, which took him 15 years. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Journalistic career==
===&quot;Newark Advertiser&quot;===
Within months of taking the editor&#x27;s chair at the &quot;Newark Advertiser&quot;, Brown was ready to buy a half share in the newspaper, for which he paid Whiles £600. The two partners agreed that until a working fund of £300 had been created out of the profits neither would draw more than £8 a month from the profits for his own use. Whiles was to manage the business side while Brown was in charge of editorial matters.

The &quot;Advertiser&quot; was being printed in Nottingham for want of adequate facilities in Newark, but Brown found this a disadvantage and in 1880 the firm took premises at the corner of Appletongate and Magnus Street to house a Wharfedale printing press. The Newark Advertiser Co Ltd was incorporated on 19 September 1882.

Cornelius Brown already had one book to his credit &quot;The Annals of Newark&quot; and in 1882 came &quot;The Worthies of Notts&quot;. Then Mr Brown laid his author&#x27;s pen aside for three or four years to concentrate on the second important step in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; story.

Six weeks later half a dozen men met at the Middlegate offices of solicitors Newton and Wallis (now Tallents Godfrey). They were the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of the Newark Advertiser Co. Ltd. namely Brown, Major George Mark, Leycester Egerton, Captain William Henry Coape, Oates MP, William Newzam Nicholson, John Burton Barrow, and William Newton. 
They were all allocated shares, as were four more men who had made applications: Joseph Gilstrap Branston, William Evelyn, Denison, Viscount Newark (later MP for Newark) and Colonel James Thorpe.

Barrow&#x27;s interest in the firm was short-lived: he sold his four shares two-and-a-half years later. Branston did the same in the following year, but at that meeting in 1882 Major Egerton was made chairman and Brown was appointed secretary, manager and editor at a salary of £200 a year. That salary remained unchanged for 21 years, at the end of which time Brown himself proposed that it should be cut to £156, because he was handing over the responsibility of night work to a younger man.

Under Brown&#x27;s editorship the &quot;Advertiser&quot; continued to flourish. The board spent 50 shillings on a treat for the workforce to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s golden jubilee. Although it was decided to buy a new printing press, Brown later reported that he could alter the present one to make it do. He still travelled in daily from Southwell until in 1889 a house was built for him next to the works, by Brown and Son at a cost of £490.

===Technology===
The &quot;Advertiser&quot; began to move into a technological age, buying a 2 hp gas engine to supplement the steam power, and in 1895 installing the telephone. Two years later came the first Linotype machine on hire. Within months came electric light, installed at a cost of £100.

Whiles, the original owner of the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, had maintained his connection with it as cashier and publisher, for the paper was still published from Stodman Street. When he died in 1900 he was succeeded by his son Herbert Whiles.

In 1903, J. C. Kew came onto the &quot;Advertiser&quot; scene in a significant way. He had already been writing for the paper for some years, while running a coal business at Beaumond Cross. He was later to be chairman of Newark Rural District Council for 21 years and during that time served two years as Mayor of Newark.

==Handing over==
At the age of 51, Brown decided to hand over some of his editorial responsibilities to Kew, who was then 35. It was a prophetic decision, for just four years later Cornelius Brown died and Kew became editor. Brown had attended the October board meeting in 1907 but was taken ill ten days later after correcting the final proofs of his &quot;History of Newark&quot;. He died on 4 November without seeing the published version of Volume II.

==Private life==
Cornelius Brown married and set up home at Almar House, Westgate, Southwell. It was there that his first child was born in 1881. She was named Ethel and later became Mrs R. P. Blatherwick.

<doc id="1168697" wikidata="Q939537" url="?curid=1168697" title="Francis Meadow Sutcliffe">
<text>Francis Meadow (Frank) Sutcliffe (6 October 1853 – 31 May 1941) was an English pioneering photographic artist whose work presented an enduring record of life in the seaside town of Whitby, England, and surrounding areas, in the late Victorian era and early 20th century. His documentation of the Victorian and Edwardian periods in Whitby, led him to be labelled as the &quot;pictorial Boswell of Whitby.&quot;&quot;

==Early life==
He was born in Headingley, Leeds, to the painter Thomas Sutcliffe and Sarah Lorentia Button. Frank was the eldest of eight children, and as a child, he slept in his father&#x27;s studio. He had an elementary education at a dame school before moving into the new technology of photography. His father moved the family to Whitby in 1870 with the hope of commissions, but he died a year later when Francis was 18, leaving him as head of the family.

==Career==

He made a living as a portrait photographer, working first in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and then for the rest of his life in Whitby, living in Broomfield Terrace in Whitby before moving to Sleights, Yorkshire. His father had brought him into contact with prominent figures in the world of art such as John Ruskin, and he resented having to &quot;prostitute&quot; his art taking photographs of holiday-makers. His business in &quot;Skinner Street&quot;, a converted jet grinding and polishing works, rooted him to Whitby and the Eskdale valley but, by photographing the ordinary people that he knew well, he built up a most complete and revealing picture of a late Victorian town, and the people who lived and worked there.

His most famous photograph was taken in 1886; &quot;Water Rats&quot; caused a little comment at the time as it featured naked children playing in a boat, but the image is not erotic. Sutcliffe was using the conventions of the academic nude to show how photography can approach art. He was, however, excommunicated by his local clergy for displaying it, as they thought it would &#x27;corrupt&#x27; the opposite sex. Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales) later purchased a copy of the picture.

He was a prolific writer on photographic subjects, contributed to several periodicals, and wrote a regular column in the &quot;Yorkshire Weekly Post&quot;. His work is in the collection of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society and in other national collections.

Sutcliffe was a founder member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood (a society that existed to promote photography as an art form), and was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1941.

At the age of 70, he became the curator of the Whitby Gallery and Museum, he held this post until his death in 1941 at the age of 87.

==Personal life==
He married Eliza Weatherill Duck, the daughter of a local bootmaker, on 1 January 1875 and had a son and four daughters at his home at High Stakesby Cottages, Ruswarp parish, Whitby. He died at his house Hvid(e)t Huus, Carr Lane, Briggswath, Sleights, aged 87, on 31 May 1941 and was buried in Aislaby churchyard.

<doc id="1168698" wikidata="Q4470096" url="?curid=1168698" title="Robert F. Williams">
<text>Robert Franklin Williams (February 26, 1925 – October 15, 1996) was an American civil rights leader and author best known for serving as president of the Monroe, North Carolina chapter of the NAACP in the 1950s and into 1961. He succeeded in integrating the local public library and swimming pool in Monroe. At a time of high racial tension and official abuses, Williams promoted armed Black self-defense in the United States. In addition, he helped gain support for gubernatorial pardons in 1959 for two young African-American boys who had received lengthy reformatory sentences in what was known as the Kissing Case of 1958.

Williams obtained a charter from the National Rifle Association and set up a rifle club to defend Black people in Monroe from Ku Klux Klan or other attackers. The local chapter of the NAACP supported Freedom Riders who traveled to Monroe in the summer of 1961 in a test of integrating interstate buses. In August 1961 he and his wife left the United States for several years to avoid kidnapping charges after a white couple got lost in the black part of town in Monroe. The local police and the FBI allegedly convinced the couple to say Williams had kidnapped them, and the FBI put out a warrant for his arrest, causing him to flee to Cuba, and, later, the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These charges were dropped by the state when his trial opened in 1975 following his return in 1970.

Williams advocated black self-defense. Williams&#x27; book &quot;Negroes with Guns&quot; (1962) has been reprinted many times, most recently in 2013. It details his experience with violent racism and his disagreement with the non-violent wing of the Civil Rights Movement. The text was widely influential; Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton and African American Defense League founder Mauricelm-Lei Millere cited it as a major inspiration.

==Early life==
===Youth===
Robert Franklin Williams was born in Monroe, North Carolina, on February 26, 1925, to Emma Carter and John L. Williams who worked as a railroad boiler washer. He had two sisters, Lorraine Garlington and Jessie Link, and two brothers, John H. Williams and Edward S. Williams. His grandmother, a former slave of Yoruba ancestry, gave Williams his grandfather&#x27;s rifle. His grandfather had been a Republican campaigner and publisher of the newspaper &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot; during the hard years after Reconstruction in North Carolina. At the age of 11, Williams witnessed the beating and dragging of a black woman by police officer Jesse Helms Sr. Helms Sr., later the Monroe chief of police, was the father of future United States Senator Jesse Helms.

As a young man, Williams joined the Great Migration, traveling north for industrial work during World War II. He worked in factories in Detroit. He witnessed the 1943 Detroit race riot prompted by labor competition between white and black Americans. Drafted in 1944, he served for a year and a half as a private in the then segregated Marines before returning home to Monroe.

===Marriage and family===
In 1947, Williams married a 16-year-old African American woman named Mabel Ola Robinson, a fellow civil rights activist. They had two children named John C. Williams and Robert F. Williams, Jr.

==Civil rights movement==
===Early NAACP activities===
Williams returned to Monroe, North Carolina and became the president of the Union County NAACP chapter in 1951. He wanted to change the segregated town to protect the civil rights of blacks.

First they worked to integrate the public library. After that success, in 1957 Williams also led efforts to integrate the public swimming pools, which were funded and operated by taxpayer monies. He had followers form picket lines around the pool. The NAACP members organized peaceful demonstrations, but opponents fired on their lines. No one was arrested or punished, although law enforcement officers were present. At that time, Monroe had a large Ku Klux Klan chapter. The press estimated it had 7,500 members, while the city had a total of 12,000 residents.

===Black Armed Guard===
Alarmed at the threat to civil rights activists, Williams had applied to the National Rifle Association (NRA) for a charter for a local rifle club. He called the Monroe Chapter of the NRA the Black Armed Guard; it was made up of about 50–60 men, including some veterans like him. They were determined to defend the local black community from racist attacks, a goal similar to that of the Deacons for Defense who established chapters in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in 1964–1965.

Newtown was the black residential area of Monroe. In the summer of 1957, there were rumors that the KKK was going to attack the house of Dr. Albert E. Perry, a practicing physician and vice-president of the Monroe NAACP. Williams and his men of the Armed Guard went to Perry&#x27;s house to defend it, fortifying it with sandbags. When numerous KKK members appeared and shot from their cars, Williams and his followers returned the fire, driving them away.

&quot;After this clash the same city officials who said the Klan had a constitutional right to organize met in an emergency session and passed a city ordinance banning the Klan from Monroe without a special permit from the police chief.&quot;

In &quot;Negroes with Guns,&quot; Williams writes:

[R]acists consider themselves superior beings and are not willing to exchange their superior lives for our inferior ones. They are most vicious and violent when they can practice violence with impunity. It has always been an accepted right of Americans, as the history of our Western states proves, that where the law is unable, or unwilling, to enforce order, the citizens can, and must act in self-defense against lawless violence.

Williams insisted his position was defensive, as opposed to a declaration of war. He relied on numerous black military veterans from the local area, as well as financial support from across the country. In Harlem, particularly, fundraisers were frequently held and proceeds devoted to purchasing arms for Williams and his followers. He called it &quot;armed self-reliance&quot; in the face of white terrorism. Threats against Williams&#x27; life and his family became more frequent.

===Kissing Case===
In 1958, Williams as head of the NAACP chapter defended two young black boys, ages seven and nine, who were jailed and beaten in Monroe after a white girl kissed each of them on the cheek and told her mother, who became enraged. The incident was covered internationally and Williams became known around the world. His publicity campaign, inviting a barrage of headlines castigating Monroe and the US in the global press, was instrumental in shaming the officials involved. Authorities eventually released the boys, who were pardoned by the governor of North Carolina, but the state never apologized for its treatment of them. The controversy was known as the &quot;Kissing Case&quot;.

===Harassment===
On May 12, 1958, the &quot;Raleigh Eagle&quot;, a North Carolina newspaper, reported that Nationwide Insurance Company was canceling Williams&#x27; collision and comprehensive coverage, effective that day. They first canceled all of his automobile insurance, but decided to reinstate his liability and medical payments coverage, enough for Williams to retain his car license. The company said that Williams&#x27; affiliation with the NAACP was not a factor; they noted &quot;that rocks had been thrown at his car and home several times by people driving by his home at night. These incidents just forced us to get off the comprehensive and collision portions of his policy.&quot;

The &quot;Raleigh Eagle&quot; reported that Williams had said that six months before, a 50-car Ku Klux Klan caravan had swapped gunfire with a group of blacks outside the home of Dr. Albert E. Perry, vice president of the local NAACP chapter. The article quoted police chief A.A. Maurey as denying part of that story. He said, &quot;I know there was no shooting.&quot; He said that he had had several police cars accompanying the KKK caravan to watch for possible law violations. The article quoted Williams: &quot;These things have happened,&quot; Williams insisted. &quot;Police try to make it appear that I have been exaggerating and trying to stir up trouble. If police tell me I am in no danger and that they can&#x27;t confirm these events, why then has my insurance been cancelled?&quot;

The following year, Williams was so incensed with the decision of a Monroe court to acquit two white men of raping a pregnant black woman, Mary Reid, that he replied by saying on the courthouse steps:

We cannot rely on the law. We can get no justice under the present system. If we feel that injustice is done, we must then be prepared to inflict justice on these people. Since the federal government will not bring a halt to lynching, and since the so-called courts lynch our people legally, if it&#x27;s necessary to stop lynching with lynching, then we must be willing to resort to that method. We must meet violence with violence.

The &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; quoted him as saying &quot;the Negro in the South cannot expect justice in the courts. He must convict his attackers on the spot. He must meet violence with violence, lynching with lynching.&quot; It is not known where these quotes originated.

===Suspension from the NAACP===
Following his statements about meeting violence with violence, Williams was removed from his NAACP position in 1959. Williams disavowed any reference to lynching, rejecting retaliatory force, also called retaliatory violence, claiming he only said that African Americans should act in armed self-defense if attacked by white people.

===Freedom Rides and prosecution===
Despite losing much support, civil rights activist James Forman was still supportive of Williams and his advocacy for using armed self defense against white oppression. Forman, who would also promote Williams&#x27; armed self-defense message during a visit to his home in Monroe, North Carolina, also agreed to assist Williams in organizing a Freedom Ride in Monroe. When CORE dispatched &quot;Freedom Riders&quot; to Monroe to campaign in 1961 for integrated interstate bus travel, the local NAACP chapter served as their base. They were housed in Newtown, the black section of Monroe. Pickets marched daily at the courthouse, put under a variety of restraints by the Monroe police, such as having to stand 15 feet apart. During this campaign, Freedom Riders were beaten by violent crowds in Anniston, Alabama and Birmingham.

In 1959, Williams was in a shoot-out with Ku Klax Klan members and local police officers, from which he fled.

On August 28, 1961, the FBI issued a warrant in Charlotte, North Carolina, charging Williams with unlawful interstate flight to avoid prosecution for kidnapping. The FBI document lists Williams as a &quot;freelance writer and janitor ... [Williams] ... has previously been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and has advocated and threatened violence ... considered armed and extremely dangerous.&quot; Williams fled to Cuba, and then to China.

==Exile and return==
===Cuba===

Williams went to Cuba in 1961 by way of Canada and Mexico. He regularly broadcast addresses from Cuba to Southern blacks on Radio Free Dixie. He established the station with approval of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, along with assistance of the government, and operated it from 1962 to 1965. While in America he had supported the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Williams used Radio Free Dixie to urge black soldiers in the U.S. armed forces, who were then preparing for a possible invasion of Cuba, to engage in insurrection against the United States.

While you are armed, remember this is your only chance to be free. ... This is your only chance to stop your people from being treated worse than dogs. We&#x27;ll take care of the front, Joe, but from the back, he&#x27;ll never know what hit him. You dig?

Williams also published a newspaper, &quot;The Crusader&quot;. In 1962, he wrote his book &quot;Negroes with Guns&quot;. It had a significant influence on Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panthers and in later years Mauricelm-Lei Millere, the founder of African American Defense League. Despite his absence from the United States, in 1964 Williams was elected president of the US-based Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM).

During his time in Cuba, Williams increased his efforts to obtain international support and publicity for the concept of African American armed self-defense. Following requests by Williams, Mao Zedong issued a statement in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in August 1963 in support of the African American struggle against discrimination. On August 10, China&#x27;s ambassador to Cuba invited Williams to the Chinese embassy to be presented with a copy of Mao&#x27;s statement. Later that month, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published a statement by Williams in which Williams stated that the dignity required self-defense and self-defense required a willingness to counterattack.

====Visit to Hanoi====
In 1965, Williams traveled to Hanoi, then the capital of North Vietnam. In a public speech, he advocated armed violence against the United States during the Vietnam War, congratulated China on obtaining its own nuclear weapons (which Williams referred to as &quot;The Freedom Bomb&quot;), and showed his solidarity with the North Vietnamese against the United States military attacks against that country.

Some Communist Party USA members opposed Williams&#x27; positions, suggesting they would divide the working class in the U.S. along racial lines. In a May 18, 1964, letter from Havana to his U.S. lawyer, civil rights attorney Conrad Lynn, Williams wrote:

Williams opposed what he described as &quot;fake Marxists&quot; who argued that black people should be patient and seek intervention through the courts and the electoral process. In Williams&#x27; view, African Americans had the right to use any means to oppose violent policies which targeted them.

===China===

In Summer 1963, &quot;Negroes with Guns&quot; was translated and published in China.

In late September 1963, Robert and Mable Williams visited China. China treated Williams as a major leader, including presenting an honor guard for his arrival. On National Day, Williams met with Mao in advance of the National Day parade. Mao asked Williams about the development of the Black Liberation movement and its future. Williams predicted a long and difficult fight. Mao responded that Williams could be patient because of his age, and that a revolutionary program must be planned and sustained because its goal is to change society permanently. After National Day, the Williamses toured China.

Also in 1963, Williams attended Mao&#x27;s 70th birthday party as an honored guest.

From 1966 to 1969, Williams lived in China, where he continued to publish &quot;The Crusader&quot;, which praised armed liberation movements in the United States and elsewhere.

Williams described China as last hope for African Americans, contending that &quot;Without China, there can be no Black struggle in America.&quot; In a speech at a demonstration against United States imperialism in 1966, Williams praised what he described as the militant friendship between the Chinese and the revolutionary American people.

Represented by the ACLU and human rights lawyer Michael Tigar, he won a lawsuit against the U.S. Postmaster General, in which the statute allowing the U.S. Post Office to refuse to deliver foreign-origin publications deemed to be &quot;communist political propaganda&quot; except at the specific prior request of the addressee was declared unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In January 1968, Conrad Lynn wrote to encourage Williams to return to the U.S., to which Williams responded:

Lynn wrote Williams in a letter on January 24, 1968: &quot;You are wise in not making a decision to come back until the financial situation is assured.&quot; Because no financial backing could be found, no 1968 &quot;Williams for President&quot; campaign was ever launched by Williams&#x27; supporters in the United States. By November 1969, Williams apparently had become disillusioned with the U.S. left. As his lawyer, Conrad Lynn, noted in a November 7, 1969 letter to W. Haywood Burns of the Legal Defense Foundation:

Williams now clearly takes the position that he has been deserted by the left. How and whether he fits black militant organizations into that category I don&#x27;t know. Radio Free Europe offered him pay to broadcast for them. So far he has refused. But he has not foreclosed making a deal with the government or the far right. He takes the position that he is entitled to make any maneuver to keep from going to jail for kidnapping...

Williams was suspected by the Justice Department of wanting to fill the vacuum of influence left after the assassinations of his friends Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover received reports that blacks looked to Williams as a figure similar to John Brown, the militant abolitionist who attacked a federal armory at Harper&#x27;s Ferry before the American Civil War attempting to arm and free enslaved Black people. Williams&#x27; attempts to contact the U.S. government in order to return were consistently rebuffed.

In March 1968, a group of several hundred African American leaders met in Detroit and declared the Republic of New Africa, electing Williams as the President of its provisional government. An RNA delegation including RNA Vice President Gaidi Obadele and Information Minister Imari Obadele traveled to China in June 1968 and met with Williams. Williams accepted the presidency and proposed diplomatic initiatives for the RNA.

===Return===
When he decided to return to the United States, Williams began to raise funds for his bail and legal defense. During that time, he decreased his rhetoric about armed revolution in an effort to avoid complicating the upcoming legal proceedings.

In 1969, Williams returned to the United States to fight the legal charges against him in North Carolina. Williams&#x27; wife, Mabel Williams returned first, in September. Williams returned via London, England, reaching Detroit in 1969. Williams had chosen to return via Detroit because he could obtain political and financial support from the Republic of New Africa there and because he had greater faith in the Michigan courts than elsewhere in the United States. Federal agents immediately arrested him and he was released on bail.

Williams resigned from his position as President of Republic of New Africa and focused on his legal case and disseminating information about China.

Williams was extradited from Michigan to North Carolina in December 1975. The historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall chaired his defense committee and a broad range of left wing activists arrived to support him. Noted attorney William Kunstler represented Williams in court. North Carolina prosecutors dismissed the charges against Williams on January 16, 1976, stating that its major witness was too weak to appear in court.

==Death ==
Williams died at age 71 from Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma on October 15, 1996. He had been living in Baldwin, Michigan. At his funeral, Rosa Parks, an activist known for sparking the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, recounted the high regard for Williams by those who joined with Martin Luther King Jr. in the peaceful marches in Alabama. Parks gave the eulogy at Williams&#x27; funeral in 1996, praising him for &quot;his courage and for his commitment to freedom&quot;. She concluded, &quot;The sacrifices he made, and what he did, should go down in history and never be forgotten.&quot;

<text>Dr. Joseph Gardner (1752–1794) was an American physician who was a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785.

== Background ==
Joseph was born in Honey Brook Township of Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1752. His father Francis Gardner immigrated to Pennsylvania from Ireland in 1733. Joseph Gardner would go on to study medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He later practiced medicine in Philadelphia. Joseph married Isabella Cochran (1747–1794) and had three children.

During the Revolutionary War, Gardner raised two battalions of troops for service. He also served on the county&#x27;s Committee of Safety in 1776-1777, and as a representative in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from 1776 to 1778. In 1779, he was member of the state&#x27;s supreme executive council. Pennsylvania sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress twice, in 1784 and 1785. Throughout this time, he continued the practice of medicine.

Gardner moved to Elkton, Maryland in 1792, and also practiced as a physician. He died in Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland in 1794.

<text>There are two streams named Salmon Trout River in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Marquette County==

The Salmon Trout River in the Huron Mountains of Marquette County is home to the &quot;coaster&quot; brook trout. The river flows into Lake Superior several miles northwest of Big Bay. The river rises in the northern portions of Michigamme Township and Marquette Township and flows through Powell Township. The headwaters of this river are in the Yellow Dog Plains.

The Huron Mountain Club (HMC) owns a large tract of land in the mountains, including a portion of the Salmon Trout River. However, the private club restricts access to its property.

This river has received attention lately as its headwaters are located near a proposed sulfide mine. Groups opposed to this claim sulfide mining may lead to acid mine drainage that can adversely affect water systems, while proponents claim that sulfide mining can be done without adverse environmental effects.

==Houghton County==

The Salmon Trout River in Houghton County, long, flows into Lake Superior on the west side of the Keweenaw Peninsula near Redridge. The river rises in Adams Township, just north of M-26, between Painesdale and Toivola. The river flows over the Redridge Steel Dam before emptying into Lake Superior.

<doc id="1168707" wikidata="Q2393447" url="?curid=1168707" title="World Ballroom Dance Champions">
<text>This page lists the official World Champions – Professional Ballroom of the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC), and its historical predecessors. The championships are authorized and organized under the auspices of the WDC. The designation &quot;Ballroom&quot; replaces the previously used &quot;Modern&quot; or &quot;Standard&quot; in WDC terminology; it does not include the latin dances.

World Championships of a sort have been held in ballroom dancing since 1909 when Camille de Rhynal held annual championships in Paris. Records of the years prior to the First World War are sketchy, and it is only since 1922 when the sport split into professional and amateur levels that complete records have been kept. The 1922 championships were also the first to award a single &#x27;world championship&#x27; as opposed to titles in the individual dances. The World Championships were held in France from 1925 to 1939, in Paris except for one year in Nice.

These annual competitions only became official in 1936, and since 1937 the title was held by dancers from the United Kingdom for the rest of that century. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the championships were put on hold for six years. Following its revival, the professional ballroom dancing world was becoming more and more fragmented as competing organizations vied for domination. Finally, in September 1950 the ICBD (International Council of Ballroom Dancing) was founded, becoming the world&#x27;s first international professional dance organisation, and all other competitions claiming to be the &#x27;World Championships&#x27; were boycotted by member nations.

The Championships returned once again in 1959 under the control of the ICBD, though that year was something of a trial run. The first officially awarded championship of the new series came in 1960, and have continued since then. The ICBD was renamed as the &quot;World Dance &amp; DanceSport Council&quot; (WD&amp;DSC), and renamed again as the WDC.

The Professional Ballroom section (occasionally called Professional Modern in British tradition) of dancesport) covers the dances waltz, foxtrot, quickstep, tango and Viennese waltz.

<doc id="1168719" wikidata="Q1855981" url="?curid=1168719" title="Kevin Barry">
<text>Kevin Gerard Barry (20 January 1902 – 1 November 1920) was an Irish Republican Army (IRA) soldier and medical student who was executed by the British Government during the Irish War of Independence. He was sentenced to death for his part in an attack upon a British Army supply lorry which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers.

His execution inflamed nationalist public opinion in Ireland, largely because of his age. The timing of the execution, only seven days after the death by hunger strike of Terence MacSwiney, the republican Lord Mayor of Cork, brought public opinion to a fever-pitch. His pending death sentence attracted international attention, and attempts were made by U.S. and Vatican officials to secure a reprieve. His execution and MacSwiney&#x27;s death precipitated an escalation in violence as the Irish War of Independence entered its bloodiest phase, and Barry became an Irish republican martyr.

==Early life==
Kevin Barry was born on 20 January 1902, at 8 Fleet Street, Dublin, to Thomas and Mary (née Dowling) Barry. The fourth of seven children, two boys and five girls, Kevin was baptised in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Westland Row. His father, Thomas Barry Sr., ran a prosperous dairy business in Dublin based at Fleet Street and supported by the output of the family&#x27;s farm at Tombeagh, Hacketstown, County Carlow. Thomas Barry Sr. died of heart disease on 8 February 1908, at the age of 56, when Kevin was six years old.

Kevin Barry&#x27;s mother, the former Mary Dowling, came from Drumguin, County Carlow, and, upon the death of her husband, moved the family to the farm at Tombeagh while retaining the family&#x27;s townhouse on Fleet Street. As a child he went to the National School in Rathvilly. In 1915 he was sent to live in Dublin and attended the O&#x27;Connell Schools for three months, before enrolling in the Preparatory Grade at St Mary&#x27;s College, Rathmines, in September 1915. He remained at that school until 31 May 1916 when it was closed by its clerical sponsors.

During this period he was undoubtedly affected by the events in April of the Easter Rising. In the same period at St. Mary&#x27;s, he also attended a commemoration concert for the Manchester Martyrs, who were hanged in England in 1867. These events served to incite his nascent nationalism to the extent that he expressed his desire to join Constance Markievicz&#x27;s Fianna Éireann. His family attempted to dissuade him, but one sister later expressed the belief that he joined.

==Belvedere College==
With the closure of St Mary&#x27;s College, Barry transferred to Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin. He was a substitute on the championship Junior Rugby Cup team and earned a place on the senior team. In 1918 he became secretary of the school hurling club which had just been formed, and was one of their most enthusiastic players. 

In 1919, his final year at Belvedere, Barry wrote an essay supporting the Dublin Lockout as a &quot;forcible demonstration of the power of Labour and had an experience also of the power of agitation in the person of that marvellous leader James Larkin and his able lieutenant, Commandant James Connolly&quot;. This piece earned him only sixty points out of a possible 100. Generally speaking, Barry&#x27;s performance as a student was erratic. In his first and third years at Belvedere, he won no honours, although he did earn honours in five subjects in his middle year. He must have learned more than his grades reflected. After graduation, he won a merit-based scholarship given annually by Dublin Corporation, which allowed him to become a student of medicine at University College Dublin (UCD).

==Medical student==
Barry entered UCD as a first-year medical student in October 1919 and remained a student for the next year. His closest friend at UCD was Gerry MacAleer, from Dungannon, whom he had first met in Belvedere. Another friend at UCD was Frank Flood, whom he had met at the O&#x27;Connell Schools, and was now an engineering student at the university.

Barry&#x27;s medical studies competed with other attractions, including dancing, drinking, gambling, and cinema. As a result, he only managed to attend about three-quarters of his medical school lectures. Not least of his distractions was his membership in the Irish Volunteers. Barry was one of several UCD medical students involved in the Volunteers, including Tom Kissane, Liam Grimley and Mick Robinson, all of whom were involved with Barry in the Monk&#x27;s Bakery ambush, along with Frank Flood. Kissane, Grimley, Robinson and Flood all survived the ambush unscathed. Flood was later captured and executed by the British in 1921. 

Despite Barry&#x27;s extensive involvement in Volunteer actions, he appears to have been very discreet. Although Barry was a member of the Volunteers for three of the four years of their friendship, his closest friend, Gerry McAleer was unaware of this aspect of his life.

==Volunteer activities==
In October 1917, during his second year at Belvedere, aged 15, he joined Company C, 1st Battalion of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. When Company C was later reorganized he was reassigned to the newly formed Company H, under the command of Captain Seamus Kavanagh. He was attached to Company C, of the 3rd Battalion of the Carlow Brigade during his vacations from school in Tombeagh. 

The following year, at age 16, he was introduced by Seán O&#x27;Neill and Bob O&#x27;Flanagan to the Clarke Luby Club of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). At some point in time, he was sworn as a member of this secret society which was led by Michael Collins. Barry&#x27;s activities in Dublin focused on training and operations to acquire weapons and ammunition. Training sites were regularly shifted to avoid discovery, but the extent of training that Barry received is questionable. 

Although he served in the Volunteers for almost three years, his operational experience prior to the Monk&#x27;s Bakery ambush was somewhat limited. For the most part, Volunteers in Dublin did little other than training and few saw action or heard shots fired in anger. He took part in a number of small operations including a raid on the Shamrock Works for weapons intended for the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), and a raid on Mark&#x27;s of Capel Street, looking for ammunition and explosives. 

Barry&#x27;s one significant action prior to Monk&#x27;s Bakery was the raid for weapons on a military outpost at King&#x27;s Inn on Constitution Hill. The Dublin Brigade had carefully reconnoitred the site and developed an operations plan to be completed within seven minutes. On 1 June 1920, a hand-picked team from the Dublin Brigade&#x27;s three battalions attacked the site taking the 25 soldiers by surprise and seizing the available weapons. Within only six minutes the raiders had secured rifles, light machine guns, and large quantities of ammunition, and had departed the site with no casualties.

==Ambush==
In mid-September 1920, Captain Seamus Kavanagh, Commander of H Company of the Dublin Brigade, was approached by James Douglas of C Company. Douglas informed him that he and John Joe Carroll of H Company had noticed that a British army lorry guarded by an armed party of soldiers made twice weekly trips to Monk&#x27;s Bakery at 79-80 Church Street to obtain bread. They had observed that the lorry came every Monday and Thursday between 11:00 and 11:15 a.m.. The party usually consisted of an officer and a driver in the cab with a non-commissioned officer and eight privates in the rear. The officer and one soldier would enter the bakery to purchase bread. Four or five soldiers would stay with the lorry without taking any particular security measures while the others would cross the street to purchase cigarettes or sweets. Within ten to fifteen minutes the bread would be loaded and the lorry would depart.

On 13 September, Captain Kavanagh went to Church Street to confirm the information and reconnoitre the area. He observed the lorry arrive and confirmed the particulars Douglas had related. After the soldiers departed he went into the bakery and talked with J.J. Moore, the foreman carpenter, whom Kavanagh knew and who was sympathetic to the Volunteers. Moore also validated the conclusions of Douglas and Carroll and stated that the party did not exceed 11 men. Moore then showed Kavanagh around the bakery so that the latter could develop a plan for an ambush including planned dispositions of his men. He was also shown a passage from the bakery yard leading into a shop in North King Street which would provide a useful line of retreat for any men posted in the yard. 
After obtaining permission to conduct the ambush Captain Kavanagh selected men from his company to participate and developed his detailed plan. At this time, Kevin Barry was a member of Company C, but upon returning to Dublin from vacation he learned of the operation and asked Captain Kavanagh if he could participate as he had done in another Company H operation in June at King&#x27;s Inn. With the addition of Barry, the operational party was to consist of Kavanagh in command, with two Lieutenants, seven Section Commanders, an Assistant Quartermaster, four Squad Leaders (one of which was Barry), and ten Volunteers. Additionally, a van was to report to the vicinity of the bakery to collect any captured weapons.

On Sunday night, 19 September, Kavanagh assembled his men and told them to report to the O&#x27;Flanagan Sinn Féin Club at 9:00 a.m. the following morning. He directed that no one was to carry anything that could be used to identify him in the event of capture. He then met privately with Barry and asked if he had an examination at UCD the next day. Barry responded, &quot;Oh, that will be all right&quot;. Kavanagh said that he didn&#x27;t want him to miss another as he had missed one on the day of the King&#x27;s Inn raid, to which Barry responded, &quot;How do you think I could sit for an examination, knowing this job is on and me not on it?&quot; Kavanagh finally agreed, and noted later that, &quot;I can never forget the look of delight on Kevin&#x27;s face when I told him he could come on the job&quot;.

On the morning of 20 September 1920, Barry went to Mass, then joined a party of IRA volunteers on Bolton Street in Dublin. Their orders were to ambush a British army lorry as it picked up a delivery of bread from the bakery and capture their weapons. The ambush was scheduled for 11:00 am, which gave him enough time to take part in the operation and return to class in time for an examination he had at 2:00 pm. The truck arrived late, and was under the command of Sergeant Banks.

Barry and members of C Company were to surround the lorry, disarm the soldiers, take the weapons and escape. He covered the back of the vehicle and, when challenged, the five soldiers complied with the order to lay down their weapons. A shot was then fired; Terry Golway, author of &quot;For the Cause of Liberty&quot;, suggests it was possibly a warning shot from an uncovered soldier in the front. Barry and the rest of the ambush party then opened fire. His gun jammed twice and he dived for cover under the vehicle. His comrades fled and he was left behind. He was then spotted and arrested by the soldiers. One of the soldiers, Private Harold Washington, had been shot dead. Two others, Privates Marshall Whitehead and Thomas Humphries, were both badly wounded and later died of their wounds. 

The British Army released the following statement on Monday afternoon:This morning a party of one N.C.O. and six men of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment were fired on by a body of civilians outside a bakery in Church Street, Dublin. One soldier was killed and four were wounded. A piquet of the Lancashire Fusiliers in the vicinity, hearing the shots, hurried to their comrades&#x27; assistance, and succeeded in arresting one of the aggressors. No arms or equipment were lost by the soldiers.

Much was made of Barry&#x27;s age by Irish newspapers, but the British military pointed out that the three soldiers who had been killed were &quot;much the same age as Barry&quot;. On 20 October, Major Reginald Ingram Marians OBE, Head of the Press Section of the General Staff, informed Basil Clarke, Head of Publicity, that Washington was &quot;only 19 and that the other soldiers were of similar ages.&quot; General Macready was well aware of the &quot;propaganda value of the soldier&#x27;s ages.&quot; Macready informed General Sir Henry Wilson on the day that sentence was pronounced &quot;of the three men who were killed by him (Barry) and his friends two were 19 and one 20 — official age so probably they were younger... so if you want propaganda there you are.&quot;

About this competing propaganda, Martin Doherty wrote in a magazine article entitled &#x27;Kevin Barry &amp; the Anglo-Irish Propaganda War&#x27;:from the British point of view, therefore, the Anglo-Irish propaganda war was probably . Nationalist Ireland had decided that men like Kevin Barry fought to free their country, while British soldiers — young or not — sought to withhold that freedom. In these circumstances, to label Barry a murderer was merely to add insult to injury. The contrasting failure of British propaganda is graphically demonstrated by the simple fact that even in British newspapers Privates Whitehead, Washington and Humphries remained faceless names and numbers, for whom no songs were written.”

==Capture and allegations of torture==

Barry was placed in the back of the lorry with the young body of Private Harold Washington, and also with Washington&#x27;s comrades. He was transported then to the North Dublin Union. Upon arrival at the barracks, he was taken under military police escort to the defaulters&#x27; room where he was searched and handcuffed. A short while later, three sergeants of the Lancashire Fusiliers and two officers began the interrogation. He gave his name and an address of 58 South Circular Road, Dublin (his uncle&#x27;s address), and his occupation as a medical student, but refused to answer any other questions. The officers continued to demand the names of other republicans involved in the ambush.

At this time a publicity campaign was mounted by Sinn Féin. Barry received orders on 28 October from his brigade commander, Richard McKee, &quot;to make a sworn affidavit concerning his torture in the North Dublin Union.&quot; Arrangements were made to deliver this through Barry&#x27;s sister, Kathy, to Desmond Fitzgerald, director of publicity for Sinn Féin, &quot;with the object of having it published in the World press, and particularly in the English papers, on Saturday 30th October.&quot;

The affidavit, drawn up in Mountjoy Prison days before his execution, describes his treatment when the question of names was repeated: He tried to persuade me to give the names, and I persisted in refusing. He then sent the sergeant out of the room for a bayonet. When it was brought in the sergeant was ordered by the same officer to point the bayonet at my stomach ... The sergeant then said that he would run the bayonet into me if I did not tell ... The same officer then said to me that if I persisted in my attitude he would turn me out to the men in the barrack square, and he supposed I knew what that meant with the men in their present temper. I said nothing. He ordered the sergeants to put me face down on the floor and twist my arm ... When I lay on the floor, one of the sergeants knelt on my back, the other two placed one foot each on my back and left shoulder, and the man who knelt on me twisted my right arm, holding it by the wrist with one hand, while he held my hair with the other to pull back my head. The arm was twisted from the elbow joint. This continued, to the best of my judgment, for five minutes. It was very painful ... I still persisted in refusing to answer these questions... A civilian came in and repeated the questions, with the same result. He informed me that if I gave all the information I knew I could get off.

On 28 October, the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;, the official propaganda news-sheet produced by Dáil Éireann&#x27;s Department of Publicity, published Barry&#x27;s statement alleging torture. The headline read: &quot;English Military Government Torture a Prisoner of War and are about to Hang him&quot;. The &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot; declared Barry to be a prisoner of war, suggesting a conflict of principles was at the heart of the conflict. The English did not recognise a war and treated all killings by the IRA as murder.

Historian John Ainsworth, author of &quot;Kevin Barry, the Incident at Monk&#x27;s bakery and the Making of an Irish Republican Legend&quot;, pointed out that Barry had been captured by the British not as a uniformed soldier but disguised as a civilian and in possession of flat-nosed &quot;Dum-dum&quot; bullets, which expand upon impact, maximising the amount of damage done to the &quot;unfortunate individual&quot; targeted, in contravention of the Hague Convention of 1899.

Erskine Childers addressed the question of political status in a letter to the press on 29 October, which was published the day after Barry&#x27;s execution.
::This lad Barry was doing precisely what Englishmen would be doing under the same circumstances and with the same bitter and intolerable provocation — the suppression by military force of their country&#x27;s liberty. 
::To hang him for murder is an insulting outrage, and it is more: it is an abuse of power: an unworthy act of vengeance. contrasting ill with the forbearance and humanity invariably shown by the Irish Volunteers towards the prisoners captured by them when they have been successful in encounters similar to this one. These guerrilla combats with soldiers and constables — both classes do the same work with the same weapons; the work of military repression — are typical episodes in Ireland. 
::Murder of individual constables, miscalled ‘police’, have been comparatively rare. The Government figure is 38, and it will not, to my knowledge, bear examination. I charge against the British Government 80 murders by soldiers and constables: murders of unarmed people, and for the most part wholly innocent people, including old men, women and boys.
::To hang Barry is to push to its logical extreme the hypocritical pretence that the national movement in Ireland unflinchingly supported by the great mass of the Irish people, is the squalid conspiracy of a ‘murder gang’.
::That is false; it is a natural uprising: a collision between two Governments, one resting on consent, the other on force. The Irish are struggling against overwhelming odds to defend their own elected institutions against extinction.

In a letter addressed to &quot;the civilised nations of the world&quot;, Arthur Griffith — then acting President of the Republic wrote:
Under similar circumstances a body of Irish Volunteers captured on June 1 of the present year a party of 25 English military who were on duty at the King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin. Having disarmed the party the Volunteers immediately released their prisoners. This was in strict accordance with the conduct of the Volunteers in all such encounters. Hundreds of members of the armed forces have been from time to time captured by the Volunteers and in no case was any prisoner maltreated even though Volunteers had been killed and wounded in the fighting, as in the case of Cloyne, County Cork, when, after a conflict in which one Volunteer was killed and two wounded, the whole of the opposing forces were captured, disarmed, and set at liberty.

Ainsworth notes that &quot;Griffith was deliberately using examples relating to IRA engagements with British military forces rather than the police, for he knew that engagements involving the police, in particular, were usually of an uncivilized nature, characterized by violence and brutality, albeit on both sides by this stage.&quot;

==Trial==
The War Office ordered that Kevin Barry be tried by court-martial under the &quot;Restoration of Order in Ireland Act&quot;, which received Royal Assent on 9 August 1920. General Sir Nevil Macready, Commander-in-Chief of British forces in Ireland then nominated a court of nine officers under Brigadier-General Onslow.

On 20 October, at 10 o’clock, the nine officers of the court — ranging in rank from Brigadier to Lieutenant — took their places at an elevated table. At 10.25, Kevin Barry was brought into the room by a military escort. Then Seán Ó hUadhaigh sought a short adjournment to consult his client. The court granted this request. After the short adjournment Barry announced, &quot;As a soldier of the Irish Republic, I refuse to recognise the court&quot;. Brigadier Onslow explained the prisoner&#x27;s &quot;perilous situation&quot; and that he was being tried on a capital charge. He did not reply. Ó hUadhaigh then rose to tell the court that since his client did not recognise the authority of the court he himself could take no further part in the proceedings.

Barry was charged with three counts of the murder of Private Marshall Whitehead. One of the bullets taken from Whitehead&#x27;s body was of .45 calibre, while all witnesses stated that Barry was armed with a .38 Mauser Parabellum. The Judge Advocate General informed the court that the Crown had only to prove that the accused was one of the party that killed three British soldiers, and every member of the party was technically guilty of murder. In accordance with military procedure, the verdict was not announced in court. He was returned to Mountjoy, and at about 8 o’clock that night, the district court-martial officer entered his cell and read out the sentence: death by hanging. The public learned on 28 October that the date of execution had been fixed for 1 November.

==Execution==
Barry spent the last day of his life preparing for death. His ordeal focused world attention on Ireland. According to Sean Cronin, author of a biography of Barry (&quot;Kevin Barry&quot;), he hoped for a firing squad rather than the gallows, as he had been condemned by a military court. A friend who visited him in Mountjoy prison after he received confirmation of the death sentence, said: He is meeting death as he met life with courage but with nothing of the braggart. He does not believe that he is doing anything wonderfully heroic. Again and again, he has begged that no fuss be made about him.

He reported Barry as saying &quot;It is nothing, to give one&#x27;s life for Ireland. I&#x27;m not the first and maybe I won&#x27;t be the last. What&#x27;s my life compared with the cause?&quot; Barry joked about his death with his sister Kathy. &quot;Well, they are not going to let me like a soldier fall… But I must say they are going to hang me like a gentleman.&quot; This was, according to Cronin, a reference to George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;.

On 31 October, he was allowed three visits of three people each, the last of which was taken by his mother, brother and sisters. In addition to the two Auxiliaries with him, there were five or six warders in the boardroom. As his family were leaving, they met Canon John Waters, on the way in, who said, &quot;This boy does not seem to realise he is going to die in the morning.&quot; Mrs Barry asked him what he meant. He said: &quot;He is so gay and light-hearted all the time. If he fully realised it, he would be overwhelmed.&quot; Mrs Barry replied, &quot;Canon Waters, I know you are not a Republican. But is it impossible for you to understand that my son is actually proud to die for the Republic?&quot; Canon Waters became somewhat flustered as they parted. The Barry family recorded that they were upset by this encounter because they considered the chief chaplain &quot;the nearest thing to a friend that Kevin would see before his death, and he seemed so alien.&quot;

Kevin Barry was hanged on 1 November, after hearing two Masses in his cell. Canon Waters, who walked with him to the scaffold, wrote to Barry&#x27;s mother later, &quot;You are the mother, my dear Mrs Barry, of one of the bravest and best boys I have ever known. His death was one of the most holy, and your dear boy is waiting for you now, beyond the reach of sorrow or trial.&quot;

Dublin Corporation met on the Monday, passed a vote of sympathy with the Barry family, and adjourned the meeting as a mark of respect. The Chief Secretary&#x27;s office in Dublin Castle, on the Monday night, released the following communiqué:The sentence of death by hanging passed by court-martial upon Kevin Barry, or Berry, medical student, aged 18½ years, for the murder of Private Whitehead in Dublin on September 20, was duly executed this morning at Mountjoy Prison, Dublin. At a military court of inquiry, held subsequently in lieu of an inquest, medical evidence was given to the effect that death was instantaneous. The court found that the sentence had been carried out in accordance with law.

Barry&#x27;s body was buried at 1.30 p.m., in a plot near the women&#x27;s prison. His comrade and fellow student Frank Flood was buried alongside him four months later. A plain cross marked their graves and those of Patrick Moran, Thomas Whelan, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Doyle, Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, Edmond Foley and Patrick Maher who were hanged in the same prison before the Anglo-Irish Treaty of July 1921 which ended hostilities between Irish republicans and the British. The men had been buried in unconsecrated ground on the jail property and their graves went unidentified until 1934. They became known as The Forgotten Ten by republicans campaigning for the bodies to be reburied with honour and proper rites. On 14 October 2001, the remains of these ten men were given a state funeral and moved from Mountjoy Prison to be re-interred at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.

==Aftermath==
The only full-length biography of Kevin Barry was written by his nephew, journalist Donal O&#x27;Donovan, and published in 1989 as &quot;Kevin Barry and his Time&quot;. In 1965, Sean Cronin wrote a short biography, simply entitled &quot;Kevin Barry&quot;; this was published by The National Publications Committee, Cork, to which Tom Barry provided a foreword. Barry is remembered in a well-known song about his imprisonment and execution, written shortly after his death and still sung today. The tune to &quot;Kevin Barry&quot; was taken from the sea-shanty &quot;Rolling Home&quot;. The execution reportedly inspired Thomas MacGreevy&#x27;s surrealist poem, &quot;Homage to Hieronymus Bosch&quot;. MacGreevy had unsuccessfully petitioned the Provost of Trinity College Dublin, John Henry Bernard, to make representations on Barry&#x27;s behalf.

==Legacy==
In 1930, Irish immigrants in Hartford, Connecticut, created a hurling club and named it after Barry. The club later disappeared for decades but was revived in 2011 by more recently arrived Irish immigrants and local Irish-Americans in the area. A commemorative stamp was issued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to mark the 50th anniversary of Barry&#x27;s death in 1970. The University College Dublin and University of Galway branches of Ógra Fianna Fáil are named after him. Derrylaughan Kevin Barry&#x27;s GAA club was founded in Clonoe, County Tyrone.

In 1934, a large stained-glass window commemorating Barry was unveiled in Earlsfort Terrace, then the principal campus of University College Dublin. It was designed by Richard King of the Harry Clarke Studio. In 2007, UCD completed its relocation to the Belfield campus some four miles away and a fund was collected by graduates to defray the cost (estimated at close to €250,000) of restoring and moving the window to this new location. A grandnephew of Kevin Barry is Irish historian Eunan O&#x27;Halpin. There is an Irish republican flute band named after him in Glasgow, the &quot;Volunteer Kevin Barry Republican Flute Band&quot;.

Barry&#x27;s execution is mentioned in the folk song &quot;Rifles of the I.R.A.&quot;, which was written by Dominic Behan in 1968. The ballad &quot;Kevin Barry&quot;, relating the story of his execution, has been sung by artists such as Paul Robeson, Leonard Cohen, Lonnie Donegan, Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, the Hootenanny Singers, Damien Dempsey, The Clancy Brothers, Tommy Makem and The Dubliners. At the place where Kevin Barry was captured (North King Street/Church Street, Dublin), there are two blocks of flats named after him.

<text>Arna is a borough in the city of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. It is one of eight boroughs in Bergen. It encompasses the northeastern part of the municipality of Bergen. Arna was merged into the city of Bergen in 1972. Prior to that, it was the separate municipality of Arna. The main population centres in the borough are the villages of Indre Arna, Ytre Arna, and Espeland.
==Location==
The borough of Arna has approximately 13,000 inhabitants. It lies along the Sørfjorden, east of the centre of the city of Bergen (the borough of Bergenhus). The large mountains Ulriken and Rundemanen lie between the city centre and Arna. Arna is geographically close to central Bergen, but it takes some time to drive there by road as there is currently no road tunnel. However, a train journey from Arna Station to Bergen only takes eight minutes since there is a train tunnel (Ulriken Tunnel) through the mountain. Takvam Station and Trengereid Station are also located within the borough, a little east of the village of Indre Arna. The European route E16 highway runs through Arna, along the shoreline.

The borough of Arna consists of many smaller &quot;village&quot; areas, since this borough includes some of the most rural parts of the city of Bergen. The village areas include Haukeland, Unneland, Espeland, Rødland, Haugland, Gaupås, Ytre Arna, Indre Arna, Arnatveit, Garnes, Takvam, Songstad, and Trengereid.

==Name==
The Old Norse forms of the name were &quot;Arni&quot; (nominative) and &quot;Arna&quot; (dative), and this was originally the old name of Arnavågen bay. The name is very old, and it is possibly related to the Italian name Arno. In the local dialect of this area, the name was traditionally pronounced &quot;Ådna&quot;. This form is still used for many other local place names such as Ådnamarka, Ådnavegen, Ådnatun, and Ådnanipa (Arnanipa).

==History==
The parish of Haus was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), including the annex Bruvik. On 1 January 1870, Bruvik (population: 2,062) was separated from Haus to form a municipality of its own. The split left Haus with a population of 4,229. On 1 January 1964, the part of Haus in Osterøy was transferred to the new municipality of Osterøy, whereas the remaining part on the mainland formed the municipality of Arna. On 1 January 1972, the city of Bergen was expanded by merging the neighboring municipalities of Arna, Bergen, Fana, Laksevåg, and Åsane into one large urban municipality. At the time of the merger, Arna had a population of 11,766.

==Attractions==
Arna has a number of natural attractions. There are several beaches along the Sørfjorden. The Arnaelva river is Bergen&#x27;s only salmon-fishing river. The mountains Ådnanipa and Gullfjellet are both accessible to hikers. The Kråmyrane nature reserve and Reppadalen nature reserve are both located in Arna. There are also two museums in Arna. The Ådnatun Museum and the Old Voss Line railway museum are both located near Indre Arna.

==Education==

Arna has a number of educational facilities. 
*Garnes barneskule, a primary school at Garnes
*Haugland school, a primary school at Haugland
*Lone school, a primary school at Haukeland
*Ytre Arna school, a primary and lower secondary school in Ytre Arna
*Ådnamarka school, a primary school at Arnatveit 
*Garnes Lower Secondary School at Garnes
*Arna Upper Secondary School at Indre Arna

<doc id="1168730" wikidata="Q242758" url="?curid=1168730" title="Bulgarian Orthodox Church">
<text>The Bulgarian Orthodox Church (), legally the [[Patriarchate]] of Bulgaria (), is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox jurisdiction based in Bulgaria. It is the first medieval recognised patriarchate outside the Pentarchy and the oldest Slavic Orthodox church, with some 6 million members in Bulgaria and between 1.5 and 2 million members in a number of other European countries, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. It was recognized as autocephalous in 1945 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

==History==
===Early Christianity===



The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has its origin in the flourishing Christian communities and churches established in Southeast Europe as early as the first centuries of the Christian era. Christianity was brought to the Thracian lands by the apostles Paul and Andrew in the 1st century AD, when the first organised Christian communities were formed. By the beginning of the 4th century, Christianity had become the dominant religion in the region. Towns such as Serdica (Sofia), Philipopolis (Plovdiv), Odessus (Varna), Dorostorum (Silistra) and Adrianople (Edirne) were significant centres of Christianity in the Roman Empire.

The Monastery of Saint Athanasius, the first Christian monastery in Europe, was founded in Thrace in 344 by Saint Athanasius near modern-day Chirpan, Bulgaria, following the Council of Serdica and the Edict of Serdica.

The raids and incursions into the Roman provinces in the 4th and the 5th centuries brought considerable damage to the ecclesiastical organisation of the Christian Church in the Bulgarian lands, yet did not destroy it. Kubrat and Organa were both baptized together in Constantinople and from the surviving Christian communities, Christianity made inroads with local Bulgar-Slavic people. By the middle of the 9th century, the majority of the early Slavs, especially those living in Thrace and Macedonia under Eastern Roman rule, were Christianized. The Christian religion also enjoyed some success among the Bulgar nobility, with recorded conversions among that group. However, it was not until the official adoption of Christianity by the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Boris I in 865 that an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical entity was established.

===Establishment===

Boris I believed that cultural advancement and the sovereignty and prestige of a Christian Bulgaria could be achieved through an enlightened clergy governed by an autocephalous church. To this end, he manoeuvred between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Roman Pope for a period of five years until in 870 AD, the Fourth Council of Constantinople granted the Bulgarians an autonomous Bulgarian archbishopric. The archbishopric had its seat in the Bulgarian capital of Pliska, and its diocese covered the whole territory of the Bulgarian state. The tug-of-war between Rome and Constantinople was resolved by placing the Bulgarian archbishopric under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, from whom it obtained its first primate, its clergy, and theological books.
Although the archbishopric enjoyed full internal autonomy, the goals of Boris I were scarcely fulfilled. A Greek liturgy offered by a Byzantine clergy furthered neither the cultural development of the Bulgarians, nor the consolidation of the Bulgarian Empire; it would have eventually resulted in the loss of both the identity of the people and the statehood of Bulgaria. 

Following the Byzantine theory of &quot;&quot;Imperium sine Patriarcha non staret&quot;,&quot; which said that a close relation should exist between an Empire and Patriarchate, Boris I greeted the arrival of the disciples of the recently deceased Saints Cyril and Methodius in 886 as an opportunity. Boris I tasked them with the instruction of the future Bulgarian clergy in the Glagolitic alphabet and the Slavonic liturgy prepared by Cyril. The liturgy was based on the vernacular of the early Slavs from the region of Thessaloniki. In 893, Boris I expelled the Greek clergy from the country and ordered the Greek language to be replaced with the Slav-Bulgarian vernacular.

===Autocephaly and Patriarchate===

Following Bulgaria&#x27;s two decisive victories over the Byzantines at Acheloos (near the present-day city of Pomorie) and Katasyrtai (near Constantinople), the government declared the autonomous Bulgarian Archbishopric as autocephalous and elevated it to the rank of Patriarchate at an ecclesiastical and national council held in 919. After Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire signed a peace treaty in 927 that concluded the 20-year-long war between them, the Patriarchate of Constantinople recognised the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and acknowledged its patriarchal dignity.

The Bulgarian Patriarchate was the first autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church, preceding the autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church (1219) by 292 years and of the Russian Orthodox Church (1596) by 662 years. It was the sixth Patriarchate after the Pentarchy patriarchates of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. The seat of the Patriarchate was the new Bulgarian capital of Preslav. The Patriarch was likely to have resided in the town of Drastar (Silistra), an old Christian centre noted for its martyrs and Christian traditions.

===Ohrid Archbishopric===
On April 5, 972, Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces conquered and burned down Preslav, and captured Bulgarian Tsar Boris II. Patriarch Damyan managed to escape, initially to Sredetz (Sofia) in western Bulgaria. In the coming years, the residence of the Bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between the next Bulgarian royal dynasty, the &quot;Comitopuli&quot;, and the Byzantine Empire. Patriarch German resided consecutively in the medieval Bulgarian cities of Maglen (Almopia) and Voden (Edessa) (both in present-day north-western Greece), and Prespa (in present-day southern North Macedonia). Around 990, the next patriarch, Philip, moved to Ohrid (in present-day south-western North Macedonia), which became the permanent seat of the Patriarchate.

After Bulgaria fell under Byzantine domination in 1018, Emperor Basil II &quot;Bulgaroktonos&quot; (the “Bulgar-Slayer”) acknowledged the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. By special charters (royal decrees), his government set up its boundaries, dioceses, property and other privileges. He deprived the church of its Patriarchal title and reduced it to the rank of an archbishopric. Although the first appointed archbishop (John of Debar) was a Bulgarian, his selected successors, as well as the whole higher clergy, were Byzantine. The monks and the ordinary priests continued to be predominantly Bulgarian. To a large extent the archbishopric preserved its national character, upheld Slavonic liturgy, and continued its contribution to the development of Bulgarian literature. The autocephaly of the Ohrid Archbishopric remained respected during the periods of Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Ottoman rule. The church continued to exist until it was abolished in 1767 by the Ottoman Empire which ruled its territory at the time.

=== Tarnovo Patriarchate ===

As a result of the successful uprising of the brothers Peter IV
and Ivan Asen I in 1185/1186, the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire were laid with Tarnovo as its capital. Following Boris I’s principle that the sovereignty of the state is inextricably linked to the autocephaly of the Church, the two brothers immediately took steps to restore the Bulgarian Patriarchate. They initially established an independent archbishopric in Tarnovo in 1186. It required almost 50 years of struggle for this archbishporic to receive recognition and elevation to the rank of a Patriarchate according to the canonical order. Following the example of Boris I, Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan manoeuvred for years between the Patriarch of Constantinople and Pope Innocent III. Finally in 1203 the latter proclaimed the Tarnovo Archbishop Vassily &quot;Primate and Archbishop of all Bulgaria and Walachia.&quot; The union with the Roman Catholic Church continued for well over two decades.
Under the reign of Tsar Ivan Asen II (1218–1241), conditions were created for the termination of the union with Rome and for the recognition of the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. In 1235 a church council was convened in the town of Lampsakos. Under the presidency of Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople and with the consent of all Eastern Patriarchs, the council confirmed the Patriarchal dignity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and consecrated the Bulgarian archbishop German as Patriarch.

Despite a reduction in size of the boundaries of the diocese of the Tarnovo Patriarchate at the end of the 13th century, its authority in the Eastern Orthodox world remained high. The Patriarch of Tarnovo confirmed the patriarchal dignity of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1346, despite protests by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Tarnovo Literary School developed under the wing of the Patriarchate in the 14th century, with scholars of the rank of Patriarch Evtimiy, Gregory Tsamblak, and Konstantin of Kostenets. A considerable flowering was noted in the fields of literature, architecture, and painting; the religious and theological literature also flourished.

=== Ottoman rule ===
Tarnovo fell under domination by the Ottoman Empire in 1393. The Ottomans sent Patriarch Evtimiy into exile and the autocephaly of the church was revoked the next year. The church was organizationally integrated into the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In 1394, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate gave the authorisation to the Metropolitan of Moldavia, Jeremiah, &quot;to move with the help of God to the holy Church of Turnovo and to be allowed to perform everything befitting a prelate freely and without restraint.&quot; By around 1416, the territory of the Patriarchate of Turnovo was totally subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The other Bulgarian religious centrethe Ohrid Archbishopric survived until 1767.
Following the execution of many leaders of the Bulgarian orthodox church, it was fully subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The millet system in the Ottoman Empire granted a number of important civil and judicial functions to the Patriarch of Constantinople and the diocesan metropolitans. After the higher-ranking Bulgarian church clerics were replaced by Greek ones at the beginning of the Ottoman period, the Bulgarian population was subjected to double oppressionpolitically by the Ottomans and culturally by the Greek clergy. With the rise of Greek nationalism in the second half of the 18th century, the clergy imposed the Greek language and a Greek consciousness on the emerging Bulgarian bourgeoisie. They used the Patriarchate of Constantinople to assimilate other peoples. At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the clergy opened numerous schools utilizing the Greek language rather than the Bulgarian language as their medium of instruction; they nearly banned Bulgarian-language liturgy. These actions threatened the survival of the Bulgarians as a separate nation and people with its own, distinct national culture. 

Throughout the centuries of Ottoman domination, Orthodox monasteries were instrumental in the preservation of the Bulgarian language and Bulgarian national consciousness. Especially important were the Zograph and Hilandar monasteries on Mount Athos, as well as the Rila, Troyan, Etropole, Dryanovo, Cherepish and Dragalevtsi monasteries in Bulgaria. The monks managed to preserve their national character in the monasteries, continuing traditions of the Slavonic liturgy and Bulgarian literature. They continued to operate monastery schools and carried out other educational activities, which managed to keep the flame of the Bulgarian culture burning. 

=== Bulgarian Exarchate ===

In 1762, St. Paisius of Hilendar (1722–1773), a monk from the southwestern Bulgarian town of Bansko, wrote a short historical work. It was the first work written in the modern Bulgarian vernacular and was also the first call for a national awakening. In &quot;History of Slav-Bulgarians&quot;, Paissiy urged his compatriots to throw off subjugation to the Greek language and culture. The example of Paissiy was followed by a number of other activists, including St. Sophroniy of Vratsa (Sofroni Vrachanski) (1739–1813), hieromonk Spiridon of Gabrovo, hieromonk Yoakim Karchovski (d. 1820), hieromonk Kiril Peychinovich (d. 1845).

Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek clergy started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s. However, it was not until 1850 that the Bulgarians purposefully struggled against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics, demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones. By that time, most Bulgarian clergy had realised that further struggle for the rights of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. As the Ottomans identified nationality with religion, and the Bulgarians were Eastern Orthodox, the Ottomans considered them part of the &quot;Roum-Milet&quot;, i.e., the Greeks. To gain Bulgarian schools and liturgy, the Bulgarians needed to achieve an independent ecclesiastical organisation.

The struggle between the Bulgarians, led by Neofit Bozveli and Ilarion Makariopolski, and the Greeks intensified throughout the 1860s. By the end of the decade, Bulgarian bishoprics had expelled most of the Greek clerics. Thus the whole of northern Bulgaria, as well as the northern parts of Thrace and Macedonia had effectively seceded from the Patriarchate. The Ottoman government restored the Bulgarian Patriarchate under the name of &quot;Bulgarian Exarchate&quot; by a decree (&quot;firman&quot;) of the Sultan promulgated on February 28, 1870. The original Exarchate extended over present-day northern Bulgaria (Moesia), Thrace without the Vilayet of Adrianople, as well as over north-eastern Macedonia. After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Bulgarian Exarchate was partially represented in southern Macedonia and the Vilayet of Adrianople by vicars. Thus, the borders of the Exarchate included all Bulgarian districts in the Ottoman Empire.

The Patriarchate of Constantinople opposed the change, promptly declaring the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic and its adherents heretics. Although the status and the guiding principles of the Exarchate reflected the canons, the Patriarchate argued that “surrender of Orthodoxy to ethnic nationalism” was essentially a manifestation of heresy.

The first Bulgarian Exarch was Antim I, who was elected by the Holy Synod of the Exarchate in February, 1872. He was discharged by the Ottoman government immediately after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War on April 24, 1877, and was sent into exile in Ankara. His successor, Joseph I, managed to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the Bulgarian Principality, Eastern Rumelia, Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. In 1895, the Tarnovo Constitution formally established the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as the national religion of the nation. On the eve of the Balkan Wars, in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, the Bulgarian Exarchate had seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates; 1,218 parishes and 1,212 parish priests; 64 monasteries and 202 chapels; as well as of 1,373 schools with 2,266 teachers and 78,854 pupils.

In 1913, Exarch Joseph I transferred his offices from Istanbul to Sofia; he died in 1915, a few months before Bulgaria fatefully opted to participate in World War I alongside the Central Powers. As a consequence of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1919, the Bulgarian Exarchate was deprived of its dioceses in Macedonia and Aegean Thrace. During the three decades after Joseph&#x27;s death, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church did not elect a regular head because of opposition from the Bulgarian government. Between 1915 and 1945 the Church was governed by the Holy Synod, similar to the Most Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.

===Second restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate===
Conditions for the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate and the election of a head of the Bulgarian Church were created after World War II. In 1945 the schism was lifted and the Patriarch of Constantinople recognised the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church. In 1950, the Holy Synod adopted a new Statute which paved the way for the restoration of the Patriarchate and in 1953, it elected the Metropolitan of Plovdiv, Cyril, Bulgarian Patriarch. After the death of Patriarch Cyril in 1971, in his place was elected the Metropolitan of Lovech, Maxim, leading the church until his death in 2012. On 10 November 2012 Metropolitan Cyril of Varna and Veliki Preslav was chosen as interim leader to organize the election of the new Patriarch within four months. 
At the church council convened to elect a new Patriarch 24 February 2013, the Metropolitan of Ruse, Neophyt was elected Patriarch of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church with 90 votes against 47 for Metropolitan Gabriel of Lovech.

Under Communism (1944–89), Bulgaria&#x27;s rulers worked to control rather than destroy the church. Still, the early postwar years were unsettling to church hierarchs. During 1944-47 the church was deprived of jurisdiction in marriage, divorce, issuance of birth and death certificates, and other passages that had been sacraments as well as state events. Communists removed study of the catechism and church history from school curricula. They generated anti-religious propaganda and persecuted some priests. 1947-49 was the apex of the campaign to intimidate the church. Bishop Boris was assassinated; Egumenius Kalistrat, administrator of the Rila Monastery, was imprisoned; and various other clergy were murdered or charged with crimes against the state. The communists soon replaced all clergy who refused to endorse the regime&#x27;s policies. They banished Exarch Stefan, who had co-authored a book in 1948 that was considered anti-Communist.
From that time until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of Communist rule in 1989, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Bulgarian Communist Party and State Security coexisted in a closely symbiotic partnership, in which each supported the other. 11 (out of 15) members of Bulgarian Orthodox Church&#x27;s Holy Synod worked for communist State Security. The party supported the elevation of the exarchate to the rank of patriarchate in May 1953. The 1970 commemoration served to recall that the exarchate (which retained its jurisdictional borders until after World War I) included Macedonia and Thrace in addition to present-day Bulgaria. Along with the wider Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church originally did not recognize the autocephaly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, since the latter&#x27;s unilateral declaration of autocephaly in 1967. However, after the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Serbian Orthodox Church restored communion with the Macedonian Church in May 2022, the Bulgarian Church followed suit on 22 June 2022.

==Canonical status and organization==
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church considers itself an inseparable member of the one, holy, synodal and apostolic church and is organized as a self-governing body under the name of Patriarchate. It is divided into thirteen dioceses within the boundaries of the Republic of Bulgaria and has jurisdiction over additional two dioceses for Bulgarians in Western and Central Europe, and the Americas, Canada and Australia. The dioceses of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church are divided into 58 church counties, which, in turn, are subdivided into some 2,600 parishes.
The supreme clerical, judicial and administrative power for the whole domain of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is exercised by the Holy Synod, which includes the Patriarch and the diocesan prelates, who are called metropolitans. Church life in the parishes is guided by the parish priests, numbering some 1,500.

<doc id="1168740" wikidata="Q326281" url="?curid=1168740" title="Scott McKenzie">
<text>Scott McKenzie (born Philip Wallach Blondheim III; January 10, 1939 – August 18, 2012) was an American singer and songwriter who recorded the 1967 hit single and generational anthem &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;.

==Early life==
Philip Wallach Blondheim III was born in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 10, 1939, the son of Philip Wallach Blondheim Jr. and the former Dorothy Winifred Hudson. His family moved to Asheville, North Carolina, when he was six months old. He grew up in North Carolina and Alexandria, Virginia, where he became friends with John Phillips, the son of one of his mother&#x27;s friends. In the mid-1950s, he sang briefly with Tim Rose in a high-school group named The Singing Strings. He graduated high school from St. Stephens School for Boys in Alexandria.

==Career==
Later, with Phillips, Mike Boran and Bill Cleary, he formed the doo wop band The Abstracts.

In New York City, The Abstracts became The Smoothies and recorded two singles with Decca Records, produced by Milt Gabler. During his time with The Smoothies, Blondheim decided to change his name for business reasons:

:&quot;[We] were working at one of the last great night clubs, The Elmwood Casino in Windsor, Ontario. We were part of a variety show ... three acts, dancing girls, and the entire cast took part in elaborate, choreographed stage productions ... As you might imagine, after-show parties were common.
:&quot;At one of these parties I complained that nobody could understand my real name ... [and] pointed out that this was a definite liability in a profession that benefited from instant name recognition. Everyone started trying to come up with a new name for me. It was [comedian] Jackie Curtis who said he thought I looked like a Scottie dog. Phillips came up with Laura&#x27;s middle name after Jackie&#x27;s suggestion. I didn&#x27;t like being called &#x27;Scottie&#x27; so everybody agreed my new name could be &#x27;Scott McKenzie&#x27;.&quot;
In 1961, Phillips and McKenzie met Dick Weissman and formed the folk group The Journeymen at the height of the folk music craze. They recorded three albums and seven singles for Capitol Records. After The Beatles became popular in 1964, The Journeymen disbanded. McKenzie and Weissman became solo performers, while Phillips formed the group The Mamas &amp; the Papas with Denny Doherty, Cass Elliot, and Michelle Phillips and moved to California.

McKenzie originally declined an opportunity to join the group, saying in a 1977 interview &quot;I was trying to see if I could do something by myself. And I didn&#x27;t think I could take that much pressure.&quot; Two years later, he left New York and signed with Lou Adler&#x27;s Ode Records.

===&quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;===

John Phillips wrote and co-produced &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot; for McKenzie. Phillips played guitar on the recording, and session musician Gary L. Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes. The bass line of the song was supplied by session musician Joe Osborn. Hal Blaine played drums.

It was released on May 13, 1967, in the United States and was an instant hit, reaching number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 2 in the Canadian &quot;RPM Magazine&quot; charts. It was also a number 1 in the UK and several other countries, selling over 7 million copies globally.

McKenzie released the single &quot;Like an Old Time Movie&quot;, which Phillips wrote, composed, and produced, and which was a top-40 hit (number 24 on Billboard; number 27 in Canada). His first album, &quot;The Voice of Scott McKenzie,&quot; was followed with an album titled &quot;Stained Glass Morning.&quot; He stopped recording in the early 1970s, living in Joshua Tree, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia.

McKenzie wrote and composed the song &quot;What About Me&quot; that launched the career of Canadian singer Anne Murray in 1968. (Murray&#x27;s United States breakthrough, with Gene McLellan&#x27;s &quot;Snowbird&quot;, would not follow for several years.)

In 1986, he started singing with a new version of The Mamas and the Papas. With Terry Melcher, Mike Love, and John Phillips, he co-wrote &quot;Kokomo&quot; (1988), a number 1 single for The Beach Boys.

By 1998, he had retired from the road version of The Mamas and the Papas, and resided in Los Angeles until his death. He appeared at the Los Angeles tribute concert for John Phillips in 2001, amongst other 1960s contemporary acts.

==Personal life==
McKenzie died on August 18, 2012, in Los Angeles at the age of 73. He developed Guillain–Barré syndrome in 2010, which lasted until his death.

<doc id="1168741" wikidata="Q2798738" url="?curid=1168741" title="CNN Center">
<text>The Center, formerly and still commonly called the CNN Center, is the former international headquarters of U.S. cable network CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The main newsrooms and studios for several of CNN&#x27;s news channels were located in the building. The facility&#x27;s commercial office space was occupied by various units of the former Turner Broadcasting System, now part of Warner Bros. Discovery. The Center is located in downtown Atlanta adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park.

In 2020, CNN announced that it would relocate its Atlanta operations back to the Turner Broadcasting Techwood campus in Midtown Atlanta. The One CNN Center office building was acquired by CP Group in 2021. Production activities moved back in October 2023, while the last of CNN&#x27;s domestic programs moved in February 2024.

On April 4, 2024, CP Group announced that CNN Center would be renovated, and was in the process of being rebranded as &quot;The Center.&quot;

==History==
===1970s and 1980s===
The building opened in 1976 as the Omni International Complex, a development by Cousins Properties. The Omni Coliseum, an NBA and NHL arena adjacent to the Omni International, had opened three years earlier, on October 14, 1972. The Omni International office building was largely vacant until CNN moved its headquarters there in 1987 from its Midtown Atlanta site (old home of the Progressive Club on 1050 Techwood Drive and home to Turner Broadcasting System). The building was bought for $42 million in 1985.

Over the years, the building had provided office space to various business tenants, as well as foreign consulates. The main floor featured an indoor ice rink, as well as a small number of restaurants and a Gold Mine video arcade. Sid and Marty Krofft built an indoor amusement park called The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, inspired by the creations of these popular children&#x27;s television producers. Opened in 1976, it was the first indoor theme park in the United States, but it closed within six months. The complex also featured a multi-screen movie theater. For years, the theater offered daily showings of the 1939 film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, which Ted Turner called &quot;The greatest movie ever made&quot;.

===1990s===

On May 11, 1997, the Omni Coliseum closed. Its replacement, Philips Arena (now State Farm Arena), broke ground on June 5, 1997. The Omni Coliseum was imploded on July 26, 1997, with the CNN Center taking on minor exterior window damage due to its close distance to the Omni Coliseum. Because of this, the CNN Center was expected to be damaged. Philips Arena opened on September 18, 1999.

===2000s===
On April 4, 2007, Arthur Mann, an employee at the Omni Hotel, shot and severely injured his ex-girlfriend Clara Riddles inside the CNN center. The adjacent CNN.com newsroom was evacuated shortly after the first shots were heard. Mann was confronted and shot by a Turner Security Officer, and both Riddles and Mann were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Riddles later died of her injuries. An autopsy showed that Riddles was shot three times by Mann. The motive of the shooting is unknown.
On March 14, 2008, an EF-2 tornado passed through downtown Atlanta, damaging the CNN Center and leaving water and dust in the upper floors. The ceiling of the atrium was also damaged, allowing water to pour in and partially flood the food court. CNN&#x27;s library was damaged, although it was not immediately known how much of its archives were damaged. Numerous injuries and widespread damage were reported overall. The Omni Hotel, attached to the CNN Center, was evacuated as a precaution, and more than 400 rooms had to be emptied of occupancy for two weeks.

===2010s===

On June 13, 2014, a car crashed into the CNN Center, causing minor structural damage. The driver claimed to have fallen asleep at the wheel, and was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and possession of marijuana.

====Disinvestment from Omni Hotel====
In 2016, the chief financial officer (CFO) Pascal Desroches of Turner said the company would divest its 50% stake in the center&#x27;s Omni Hotel in favor of redeveloping its Techwood campus in Atlanta. This is where other Turner broadcast operations are based.

===2020s===

On May 29, 2020, the CNN Center became the scene of rioting in response to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, four days earlier, as the building also houses a Zone 5 police precinct for the Atlanta Police Department. Rioters graffitied the CNN logo in the front of the building and caused property damage to the building&#x27;s entrance glass curtain wall and APD vehicles; the front lobby was damaged, though protesters never breached into the core common area of the building, with the logo sign repainted shortly thereafter.

On June 29, 2020, exactly a month after the incident, WarnerMedia announced plans to sell the CNN Center. Once sold, WarnerMedia will continue to lease their existing space for several years until the Techwood campus, previously occupied by CNN until 1987, is expanded to accommodate CNN&#x27;s Atlanta operations.

On November 21, 2020, a group of right-wing activists organized by the WalkAway campaign gathered in front of the CNN Center. In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won the state&#x27;s 16 electoral votes, the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. The protesters were inspired by claims of voter fraud.

On January 11, 2023, it was reported that CNN would be leaving the CNN Center before the end of 2023. CNN control room activities moved back to CNN&#x27;s original Midtown Atlanta campus on October 30, 2023. Several weekend shows would continue to be based at CNN Center through the end of 2023. On February 25, 2024, &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; and &quot;CNN This Morning Weekend&quot; aired their final broadcasts from the CNN Center, and moved to Techwood the following week.

On April 4, 2024, CP Group announced that CNN Center would be renovated and rebranded as &quot;The Center.&quot;

==Features==
The CNN Center also houses an Omni Hotel and features a large atrium food court frequented by local business employees, tourists, attendees at State Farm Arena, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium events, and conference attendees from the nearby Georgia World Congress Center.

CNN&#x27;s multi-channel output to the world is broadcast on large screens around the center. Until 2020, studio tours were available and included demonstrations of technologies, such as Chroma key and teleprompters, as well as visits to viewing galleries overlooking the newsrooms and anchors of CNN International, HLN, CNN 10, and CNN en Español.

The atrium escalator used to first transport visitors to the The World of Sid and Marty Krofft and later to the CNN tour has been listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;longest freestanding (supported only at the ends) escalator in the world&quot;; it is long. Built for the theme park that once occupied the building, it is part of the building&#x27;s original structure, making it very hard to remove. The steel exoskeleton remains, but the escalator was removed the week of February 24, 2025 as a part of the renovations transitioning the building from &quot;The CNN Center&quot; to &quot;The Center.&quot;

MARTA rail service is provided to the CNN Center at the GWCC/CNN Center station. Access to the Red and Gold lines may be gained by a ten-fifteen minute walk to Peachtree Center station.

<text>Blazhko is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the northwest of the crater Joule, and to the south of Gadomski. The fresh, bright crater Wargo is to the south.

The rim of this crater is generally circular, but with some irregularities. There is a small outward bulge in the rim to the east-southeast, and an inward bulge on the opposite face. There is also a slight outward bulge along the north rim. The satellite crater Blazhko F is attached to the exterior of the east rim. The inner wall along the northeast face is striated with s. The interior floor is relatively level.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Blazkho.

<doc id="1168758" wikidata="Q2393434" url="?curid=1168758" title="World Latin Dance Champions">
<text>This page lists the official World Champions – Professional Latin of the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC). The championships are authorized and organized under the auspices of the WDC, and held annually in the last quarter of each year. The competition comprises five dances:
Cha-Cha-Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso Doble and Jive, as defined in ballroom dancing terms.

Official World Championships have been held in the Latin section of ballroom dancing since they were organised by the ICBD in 1959. The ICBD was renamed WD&amp;DSC and has been renamed again to its present title. The WDC represents all the major professional DanceSport countries. Unofficial world championships were held, usually in Paris, by several organisers pre-World War II. Some of these events included one or two Latin dances in the same competition as ballroom dances. As these events had no official standing, they are not noticed here. There is one earlier international Latin dance championship; it started in 1953 at the Elsa Wells International Dance Championships in London (see International Latin American Dance Champions). Both series have continued annually.

<doc id="1168764" wikidata="Q984379" url="?curid=1168764" title="Summerland, British Columbia">
<text>Summerland is a district municipality on the west side of Okanagan Lake in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. The district is between Peachland to the north and Penticton to the south. The largest centre in the region is Kelowna, approximately to the north (via Highway 97), and Vancouver is approximately away to the west. The district is famous for &quot;Bottleneck drive&quot;, a system of roads connecting various wineries.

==Electoral representatives==
The current mayor is Doug Holmes. The district&#x27;s Member of Parliament is Dan Albas of the Conservative Party of Canada. Its member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia is British Columbia Conservative Party member, Amelia Boultbee.

==History==
In 2006, the District of Summerland celebrated its centennial as an incorporated municipality in 1906, yet the history of settlement in the Summerland area extends beyond that time. Summerland&#x27;s first inhabitants were the Syilx (Okanagan Salish), with the First Nations boundaries extending from Kamloops to southern Washington state. The area known as &quot;Nicola Prairie&quot; was notably named after the Grand Chief Nicola.

A published map of the Okanagan Valley in 1827 includes only three sites for the entire Okanagan Valley; Nicola Prairie; Lone Tree (north end of Summerland); and Sandy Cove (across the lake from present day Kelowna). Summerland&#x27;s proud and diverse past includes hunting and fur trading, ranching, orchards and fruit industries, transportation hubs and more recently, tourism. Immigration to the Summerland area commenced in the late 1880s when the first settlers arrived and began diverting water to irrigate orchards. The first commercial orchard was planted in the 1890s in Trout Creek, where a water license was issued to irrigate .

The first settlement identified on maps of the Okanagan Valley was Priest Encampment located on the shores of Garnett Lake. Later development began on the shores of Okanagan Lake. The upper benches continued to be an important transportation route and a number of small communities were constructed or were planned for development. They included Upper Trout Creek, Balcomo, the Prairie Valley Townsite, Mineola and Appledale. In 1892 Upper Trout Creek was established.

Summerland&#x27;s former name was Trout Creek. In the 1890s George Barclay operated the largest cattle ranch in Trout Creek. In 1902, Sir Thomas Shaughnessy bought the Barclay Ranch and formed Summerland; incorporation was not completed until 1906. By the 1920s the present location of downtown Summerland was developed and the earlier areas on the upper benches were not utilized or forgotten. Downtown Summerland (Siwash Flat) was originally part of the Penticton Indian Reserve No. 3 (exchanged between 1904–06 following a mutually agreeable land deal). The subject lands eventually became known as West Summerland.

Present-day Lower Town was the original town site of Summerland. In the early 1900s the Summerland Development Company with Sir Thomas Shaughnessy (president) and J.M. Robinson (manager) primarily responsible for the initial decisions on its development. From the company, the community received water, septic tanks, electricity, a post office, a school and a sawmill. Settlers from across the prairies, eastern Canada and England were drawn to the Summerland area.

By 1907, Summerland had access to Peachland and Penticton with a well-established road system, and a ferry service connecting the community with the eastern shore of Okanagan Lake (Naramata). West Summerland (present day Downtown Summerland) experienced increased importance also in part due to a 1922 fire which destroyed many of the lakeside buildings in Lower Town.

Summerland has two private schools (a Montessori school) and Unisus, a day and full-time boarding school with students from the local Okanagan area and from countries around the world.

==Tourism==
Summerland is popular because of its situation on Okanagan Lake and sandy beaches, a destination for three major Canadian population centres (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton). Both tourism and tourist attractions are a significant industry. Agriculture, featuring fresh tree fruits (peaches, cherries, apricots, apples and pears), and canneries, were the economic engine of the region until the late 20th century. Stone fruit and apples are now produced mainly for the fresh market (local and export). Over the past 20 years, Summerland has become home to several world-renowned wineries, and despite being in a semi-arid climate, has several golf courses. Summerland is also home to the historic Kettle Valley Steam Railway. The railway takes tourists on a trip around the Dale Meadows region of Summerland and further, eventually ending at the famous Trout Creek Trestle. Tourism Summerland guides visitors to Summerland attractions and events.

==Wine==
Summerland is home to one of Canada&#x27;s largest wine industries. Many of Summerland&#x27;s wineries are connected by the famed &#x27;Bottleneck Drive.&#x27;

==Sport==

Summerland is formerly the home of the Summerland Steam of the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League, which relocated to Williams Lake in 2024. The town also used to be the home of the Summerland Sting (2001–2009), and the Summerland Warriors (1999–2000), both of whom played in the same league. Previously the Summerland Buckaroos played in the British Columbia Hockey League from 1983–1988. Summerland is also home to the Summerland Minor Hockey Association (SMHA) known as the Summerland Jets.
Football Club (FC) Detonate, founded in 2024, competes in the South Okanagan Men’s Soccer League (SOMSL).

==Geography==
Summerland is located within the Thompson-Okanagan Plateau ecoregion. This is one of the warmest and driest ecoregions in Canada. It is characterized by rolling plateaus and major valley systems of the Okanagan, Thompson and Nicola Rivers. In the summer of 2003, a severe drought nearly rendered the town&#x27;s reservoir incapable of ensuring a water supply through to the beginning of the next annual replenishment cycle. Since then, awareness of the real need for water conservation measures has begun to be taken seriously, and permanent water use restrictions are now in place.

The immediate ecosystem consists of grasslands in a matrix of bluebunch wheatgrass and sagebrush amongst scattered ponderosa pines. The region has a gently rolling surface covered mainly by glacial deposits. Summerland is home to an extinct volcano, known locally as Giant&#x27;s Head Mountain – so-named for its gigantic facial profile as viewed from the southeast. This hill dominates the town&#x27;s land features and provides an hour&#x27;s hike to the top for an expansive view up and down the Okanagan Valley.

The range of representative wildlife around Summerland includes mule deer, Canada geese, California quail, ravens, coyotes, red wolves (half coyote, half wolf), blue grouse, bald eagles, and black widow spiders. The hills surrounding Summerland is the natural habitat for black bear, white-tailed deer, moose, cougars and bobcats, California big-horn sheep, mountain goats, and rattlesnakes.

===Climate===
Summerland has a humid continental climate with hot, dry summers and cool winters. The mean annual temperature of the major valleys is approximately with a summer mean of and a winter mean of ; however, winter months are often very temperate and cold weather usually lasts no more than a few weeks, while summer months often see drought with high daytime and cool night time temperatures. Late fall and most of the winter see very little sunshine in Summerland, but Summerland gets more days with sunshine during the spring than any other place in Canada. The sun makes an appearance on average of 88.4 days each spring.

Because Summerland is located up on a natural bench, it stays relatively warm at night. By comparison, Penticton experiences colder nights as the cool air sinks down into the valley below. These warm nights in a dry climate means that Summerland has the lowest morning relative humidity in Canada from May through September.

== International relations ==
Summerland serves as a sister city with Omak, Washington, a city in the United States, and Toyokoro, Hokkaido, a town in Japan.

<text>Lemaître is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south of the older crater Minkowski, and north of Crommelin. To the east-southeast lies the crater Eijkman.

The outer rim of Lemaître remains well-defined, although it has become eroded and rounded by a history of minor impacts. The rim is generally circular, but it has a polygonal, angular outline, particularly in the southeastern half. For much of circumference, the inner wall consists of a rim that slopes down to a slumped , which then slopes down more gently to the interior floor.

There are a few tiny craterlets lying along the rim of Lemaître, especially in the west and the southeast. The most notable of these craterlets is a small, bowl-shaped crater that is attached to the southwestern rim.

The floor of the crater is generally flat, but contains a prominent crater Lemaître F along the eastern inner wall. This crater is also somewhat angular in shape, especially in the parts that are not concentric with the inner wall. The remainder of the floor is marked with a few tiny craterlets, the largest of which is adjacent to the western interior wall.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lemaître.

The floor of the satellite crater Lemaître F (within Lemaître itself) may be the lowest point on the moon.

<doc id="1168771" wikidata="Q4903788" url="?curid=1168771" title="Bicycle law in California">
<text>Bicycle law in California is the parts of the California Vehicle Code that set out the law for persons cycling in California, and a subset of bicycle law in the United States. In general, almost all the same rights and responsibilities that apply to car drivers apply to bicycle riders as well.

== General applicability of road rules ==

CVC 21200 states that the rules of the road, set out in Division 11 of the California Vehicle Code, that do not specifically apply only to motor vehicles are applicable to cyclists. Police officers riding bicycles are exempt from the provisions when they are responding to an emergency call, engaged in rescue operations, or in immediate pursuit of a suspect.

== Locations of cycling ==

=== On-road ===
CVC 21650 sets the on-road position for all vehicles, including bicycles.
21650(g) clarifies that bicycles are not prohibited from riding on sidewalks or crosswalks but does allow for local ordinance to prohibit such operation.

It is not illegal for bicycles to ride on the sidewalk in a direction opposing the flow of traffic. However, doing so is quite dangerous.

CVC 21650.1 clarifies that cyclists, unlike drivers of vehicles, are generally not prohibited from riding on the shoulder of the road.

Cyclists are allowed but never required to ride on the shoulder. CVC 530 defines the &quot;roadway&quot; as &quot;that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel&quot;. The on-road position of cyclists is narrowed by CVC 21202, which requires riding &quot;as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway&quot; except in certain circumstances.

The wording &quot;shall ride as close as practicable to the right&quot; is sometimes misunderstood by police officers as well as cyclists.

CVC Section 21960 authorizes local authorities to prohibit or restrict the use of bicycles on freeways.

Where bike lanes exist on roadways, CVC 21208 requires cyclists to use them, except under certain conditions. There is no requirement to ride in a bike lane or path that is not on the roadway.

There is no requirement in the California Vehicle Code, but side-by-side riding may be regulated by local ordinance.

=== Off-road ===

CVC 21100 sets out that &quot;Local authorities may adopt rules and regulations... regarding the ... Operation of bicycles, and, as specified in Section 21114.5, electric carts by physically disabled persons, or persons 50 years of age or older, on the public sidewalks.&quot; Under this provision, many California cities have banned sidewalk cycling in business districts.

==Movement==

CVC 22107 requires cyclists to yield and signal before moving left or right.

CVC 21656 specifies that slow-moving vehicles causing a queue of five or more vehicles behind them must turn off the roadway in order to allow the vehicles behind to pass them. Section 21202 explicitly states that cyclists are &quot;subject to the provisions of Section 21656&quot;.

CVC 21760 requires motor vehicles to leave a 3-foot margin while passing a cyclist if possible.

=== Cyclist&#x27;s Duties to Other Cyclists, Pedestrians, Runners, and Self ===

It is arguably legal for cyclists to race each other on open public roads in California if that is safe at the time under the circumstances. In traffic, or where visibility is limited (rain, fog, wooded areas, curvy roads), racing would be arguably negligent and unlawful. CVC 21200(a), provides: &quot;Every person riding a bicycle upon a highway... is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle by this division... except those provisions which by their very nature can have no application.&quot; Under the common law in California, all vehicle operators (including bike operators) have a general duty to use reasonable care to avoid collisions with other cyclists, cars, runners and pedestrians, since it is not the case that runners and pedestrians (for example) are always prohibited by the CVC from sharing a bike lane.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Equipment requirements ===
A bicycle ridden on public roads must have a brake on at least one wheel which can make the wheel skid on dry pavement.

CVC 21201 (d) 
A bicycle operated during darkness upon a highway, a sidewalk where bicycle operation is not prohibited by the local jurisdiction, or a bikeway... shall be equipped with all of the following
* A white front lamp (either attached to the bike or to the rider) which can be seen from away.
* A red rear safety reflector visible from away when illuminated by automobile headlights.
* White or yellow reflectors visible from on the bike&#x27;s pedals or the cyclist&#x27;s feet or ankles.
* A white or yellow reflector on each side of the bike&#x27;s front half.
* A white or red reflector on each side of the bike&#x27;s back half.

=== Bicycle helmets for minors ===
CVC 21212 requires cyclists under the age of 18 to wear helmets. The charge can be dismissed if the person charged declares under oath that it is their first violation of this section. Otherwise, the infraction is punishable by a fine not more than $25. Parents will be held liable for the fine.

Under CVC 21100(a) local authorities may adopt ordinances for the purpose of &quot;Regulating or prohibiting processions or assemblages on the highways.&quot;

=== Riding under the influence ===
CVC 21200.5 prohibits riding a bicycle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.

=== Possibility of licensing ===

CVC 39002 abrogates the power of local authorities to prohibit riding of unlicensed bicycles.

It lies in midst of the triangle of craters formed by Bose to the northeast, Cabannes to the southeast, and Abbe to the west. The region about this crater is relatively level, although marked with a number of fresh, bowl-shaped craters.

The form of Haret is generally circular, with an outward notched in the southwest rim where a smaller crater has merged with the formation. There is a second, even smaller impact in the northeast rim. The interior floor has been flooded in the past by basaltic lava, leaving a level interior and a low outer rim. Seen from afar, the interior floor is almost featureless, having only a couple of tiny craterlets to mark the surface.

This feature was named after the Romanian mathematician and astronomer Spiru Haret.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Haret.

<text>Augustus Heinrich Petermann (18 April 182225 September 1878) was a German cartographer.

==Early years==

Petermann was born in Bleicherode, Germany. When he was 14 years old, he started grammar school in the nearby town of Nordhausen. Despite family pressures to become a clergyman, he pursued his passion for cartography instead.

Heinrich Berghaus, with the support of Alexander von Humboldt, started the &#x27;Geographische Kunstschule&#x27; (Geographical School of Art) in 1839 in Potsdam, close to Berlin, following the example of the school for engravers at the Archives Militaires Generales in Paris (founded in 1811). During its existence, Berghaus&#x27;s academy offered only three courses, and only a few students attended:
* 1839–1844: August Petermann, Heinrich &#x27;Henry&#x27; Lange (1821–1893), and Otto Göcke, who died one year later of tuberculosis.
* 1844–1847: Amandus Sturmhöfel (1823–?) and Theodor Schilling.
* 1845–1850: Hermann Berghaus (1828–1890), his nephew.

Petermann&#x27;s father, August Rudolf Petermann, who was a registrar at Bleicherode, could not pay for the further education of his son. When he read the advertisement for Berghaus&#x27; school he sent his son&#x27;s maps and other work for evaluation. One of the maps, drawn when he was 16, shows South America, and was later published in the journal which was to carry his name. Berghaus recognized the quality of Petermann&#x27;s work, and therewith his potential and soon took him in as a foster-son. As Berghaus already had a large family to feed, however, he requested an annual subsidy of 60 thaler from the king to support Petermann, which was granted. During the 3rd course, Berghaus treated his nephew Hermann Berghaus the same way. Only Lange paid for the courses, the rest followed them at Berghaus&#x27;s own expense.

Petermann started his education in Potsdam on 7 August 1839. The education with Berghaus was scientifically cartographic, consisting of mathematical geography (map projections and grids), physical geography (meteorology, hydrology and geology) and political geography (knowledge of borders and administrative divisions of European states especially). Physical training was aimed at surveying, drafting and engraving. Berghaus&#x27;s pupils learned only the rudiments of surveying, even less than he himself had learned: their work in this area can be seen in the plan of Potsdam (&quot;Neüester Plan von der Königlichen Residenzstadt Potsdam&quot; / nach trigonometrischen Vermessungen, so wie geo- und hydrometrischen Aufnahmen ausgearbeitet in der Geographischen Kunstschule zu Potsdam unter der Leitung ihres Direktors, des Professors Dr. Heinrich Berghaus. 1845). They were not topographers and only used topography as published in the large-scale maps of that era as a general basis for their later, more generalized works. They were taught more to draft and engrave medium-scale geographic maps of states, continents etc., or their parts (e.g. the map of upper and middle-Italy in 1847 for &quot;Stielers Handatlas&quot;, which was based on Attilio Zuccagni-Orlandini&#x27;s 1844 topographic map in nearly 100 sheets), small-scale generalised school maps, and especially applied geography and cartography as shown in their collaboration on the &quot;Physikalischer Atlas&quot; and the maritime atlas. During their study lithography, though not cutting as fine a portrayal as copper engraving, was on the rise because it was much cheaper. Though some experiments were made by Berghaus, e.g. for geological maps, by mixing copper engraving for the line- and other features and lithography for coloured polygons, there was no technology that could replace the exquisite expression copper engravings could reach. So the students mainly learned this art. Only at the end of his life did Petermann became more enthusiastic about lithography, which had advanced by then. Up to and including the 10th edition of the &quot;Stieler Handatlas&quot; (1920–1925) the Perthes Institute, where he worked from 1854 onwards, used copperplate engravings as the basis for its maps. Some 460 copperplates of this edition are currently preserved in the Perthes collections in Gotha.

Berghaus had been riding numerous hobbyhorses (terrain representation, isolines, scale indicators, map projections, etc.) without much success, but now he could finally put them to work with his pupils. He very successfully disseminated many of his ideas and concepts. Moreover, his students somehow learned better than he to limit their endeavors in order to bring more of them to full fruition. Though the school itself had but few students, its residency in Potsdam, connected by rail to Berlin, and the fame of Berghaus attracted many geographers (e.g. Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Ritter and Zeune), cartographers and explorers. Petermann spoke highly of his encounters with von Humboldt and drew several maps for his &quot;Atlas von Asien&quot;, on which the rendering of the Asiatic mountain chains was of a quality corresponding to the then-current view of the geographic sciences. Because of all these contacts, the students were confronted with many opinions and views on the state of science and the world that would not normally have been part of their curriculum. Besides, we may take Poggendorff seriously when he sees Petermann as &#x27;private secretary and librarian of H.K.W. Berghaus&#x27; in the years 1839–45, so we can assume that Petermann was at least quite up to date on many affairs to do with geography and cartography, for Berghaus had large collections of maps, books and notes to draw on.

During and after their training, students were obliged to take part in most of the school&#x27;s enterprises. In the years 1839–1848, the school produced maps for Stieler&#x27;s school atlas, and Berghaus&#x27;s &quot;Physikalischer Atlas&quot;, school atlases, the &quot;Atlas von Asien&quot;, the Prussian atlas, and the maritime atlas.

==British experience==

===Scotland===
August Petermann gained commercial insight during his years in the cartography business in Edinburgh and London from 1845 to 1854. Normally he would have been obliged to work in Berghaus&#x27; school until 1849, as it was laid down in the contracts the students had to sign. These stated that the students had to work for five years after they finished their studies to pay for their tuition.

In 1842, Alexander Keith Johnston (1804–1871) visited Gotha to discuss several projects with Perthes. These negotiations first resulted in the publication of the &quot;National Atlas of General Geography&quot;, which contained 4 maps by Berghaus. Though Berghaus deemed the commercial and scientific climate in England not ready for scientific maps Johnston persisted in wanting to publish a translation of the Physikalischer Atlas, on which he requested aid from Berghaus. With a letter of recommendation by von Humboldt in October 1844, Heinrich &#x27;Henry&#x27; Lange joined Johnston in Edinburgh for this purpose. Petermann stayed behind in Gotha and became a teacher in the 2nd course of Berghaus&#x27; school. In April 1845, he followed Lange, who received him in his house in Edinburgh and acquainted him with the friends he had made. Together they went on a tour through the Grampians, applying what they had learned by using barometers for height measurements and taking geological and botanical samples. Meanwhile, they also worked on Johnston&#x27;s Physical atlas (&quot;Physical geography, illustrating in a series of original designs, the elementary facts of geology, hydrology, meteorology and natural history etc.&quot;) and several other cartographic publications.

During his time in Edinburgh, he may have come into contact with the publisher G.H. Swanston, for whom he constructed several maps for The Royal Illustrated Atlas, Of Modern Geography, 1st edition published in 27 parts 1854–62. and republished probably in 1872. He also may have met John Bartholomew Jr. (1831–1893) in Edinburgh, who created many maps in the same atlas. John Bartholomew became Petermann&#x27;s student in Gotha in 1855 until he was recalled to his father&#x27;s firm in 1856. The German school of cartography was pre-eminent, and four generations of Bartholomews widened their knowledge by studying with the German masters. John George&#x27;s son Ian studied in Leipzig (1907–08) with Oswald Winkel. His grandson John Christopher carried on the tradition, studying with Eduard Imhof, the great Swiss cartographer, in Berne and Zurich in 1960, and his son John Eric followed in 1977 with Imhof&#x27;s pupil, Ernst Spiess.
&quot;Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric tints), the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice&quot;. However, he might have picked up this idea during his time in Gotha as the colour scheme was first introduced by Emil von Sydow (1812–1873) in 1838 when he developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands. The white for the higher reaches might later have been used by Hermann Haack (1872–1966) for his Perthes&#x27; wall maps.
Several maps were co-constructions of Petermann and Bartholomew.

===London===
In 1847, Petermann moved to London with the intention of furthering his geographical studies and then returning to Germany. Soon, however, he decided to follow a professional career there as the environment he moved into seemed to be favorable for his prospects. In London, he worked as a reporter for a London periodical (&quot;Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;journal of literature, science and the fine arts&quot;. London, 1828–1921), and in 1850 founded his own establishment: The Geographical Establishment, Engraving, Lithographic and Printing Office, 9 Charing Cross. In 1852 the young Ernst Georg Ravenstein (1834–1913) was apprenticed to him before he went in 1855 into the service of the Topographical Department of the British War Office. Petermann&#x27;s firm published, among other things, the &quot;Atlas of physical geography with descriptive letter press&quot; (1850, with Thomas Milner), and the &quot;Physical statistical maps of the British Isles, showing the geographical distribution of the population and inland hydrography&quot;. His productions for the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society included the map &quot;Survey of the Sea of Aral by commander A. Butakoff, 1848 &amp; 1849&quot;. He also established lifelong relationships with many scientists, politicians and explorers, mainly through his membership of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London. In 1847, he became a member of the RGS. When he was 28 in 1850 he was elected under-Secretary. In 1868 he was awarded with the prestigious &#x27;Founders medal&#x27; of the RGS. Queen Victoria, at the suggestion of Robert Bunsen, appointed him &#x27;physical geographer-royal&#x27;.

Early in his career, Petermann already wanted to further the cause of geographical exploration as shown by his concern for and interference with James Richardson&#x27;s expedition. The purpose of this expedition, which was supported by the British government, was to negotiate trade treaties with the rulers of the middle Sudan. Petermann, supported by Carl Ritter and Robert Bunsen, pleaded with the British government to let Heinrich Barth and Adolf Overweg join up with Richardson&#x27;s expedition to assure that geographical and scientific aspects which they might encounter were taken care of. When still affiliated with the &quot;Zeitschrift für Allgemeine Erdkunde&quot;, he published their progress in this journal, and when he started &quot;Petermanns geographische Mitteilungen&quot; he followed this through.

===Maps and articles published in English media===
His long stay in Britain made him familiar with the best in British and German geography, and he was fluent in both German and French, which knowing both was a prerequisite to attend Berghaus&#x27; school. That helped him to read as widely as necessary for his further career. His love for the exploration of the polar regions probably started in London, for many of the polar explorers, especially after the disappearance of the Franklin expedition, presented their discoveries to the Royal Geographical Society. From 1848 onward he published, among other things, the following articles and maps with English publishers or in English language journals:

It is no surprise to see that his sphere of interest in &#x27;current&#x27; geography, was only sharpened when paired with his updating of Stieler&#x27;s Hand-Atlas. In stressing the geographic nature of cartography, he showed himself more a Humboldtian than a follower of Ritter&#x27;s political-historical school.
M. Linke et al. wrote in 1986: &quot;There seems to be no doubt that Petermann’s work contributed to the high standards of British cartography during these years&quot;. T.W. Freeman has noted that &quot;Fine maps had been produced in the 1851 Census by August Heinrich Petermann during his long stay in Britain (1845–54) with the Johnston map firm in Edinburgh and later in London, but since his departure, the standard has declined &quot;.
In 1852 and 1853, Petermann published some maps on cholera in Britain, explaining that the map, better than tables, can show the progress and victim density of the disease, following the example set by Heinrich Berghaus in his &quot;Physikalischer Atlas&quot;, Band II, Abt. VIII, no. 2 (1847). These were later followed by Keith Johnston in the second edition of &quot;The physical atlas of natural phenomena&quot; (1856).

==&quot;Petermanns geographische Mitteilungen&quot; (PGM)==
See footnote

===Start-up of the journal===
&quot;From the early 1850s, Petermann maintained private and business contacts with the two Gotha publishers Wilhelm and Bernhardt Perthes, and in June 1853 he actually spent a short time in Gotha.&quot;. Financial difficulties and several other factors prompted him to accept the Perthes&#x27; offer of work in 1854. Early in his German career here Petermann was appointed first professor (1854) and later honorary doctor (1855) of the University of Göttingen by the Duke of Gotha. Bernhardt Perthes hired him with the prospect of playing an important role in the establishment of his geographical institute. At the same time, his friend Henry Lange also started to work with Perthes. When he was refused a position equal to Petermann he left Perthes and started to work for Brockhaus in Leipzig.
When Petermann went to the Gotha Institute part of the original plan was that he would revive the &quot;Geographisches Jahrbuch&quot; (Geographical Yearbook), which Heinrich Berghaus had edited from 1850 to 1852. At the suggestion of the manager Adolf Müller (1820–1880) it was decided instead to publish the monthly &quot;Mittheilungen aus Justus Perthes Geographischer Anstalt über wichtige neue Erforschungen auf dem Gesamtgebiet der Geographie von Dr. A. Petermann&quot; (PGM) (Communications from the Justus Perthes Geographical Institute concerning important new studies in the whole field of geography, by Dr. A. Petermann). These were to be published in &#x27;casual issues&#x27;. Their relation to several of the Perthes atlases was plainly expounded in the preface to the first issue of 1855:

&quot;Our &#x27;Communications&#x27; will differ from all similar publications in that they will summarise and graphically illustrate the results of new geographic explorations in precisely executed and carefully detailed maps. Every issue of our periodical will therefore include one or more map supplements, and their design will guarantee a continuous and easily accessible supplement in easy-to-manage form with special regard for those who own Stielers Hand-Atlas, Berghaus&#x27;s Physical Atlas, and other map publications of the (Perthes) Institute. We will take special care to always present our readers with important new discoveries immediately or as fast as possible.&quot;

In the same preface he put the main focus of the &#x27;Mittheilungen&#x27; on physical and bio-geography, geology and other natural phenomena, and to a lesser degree on ethnography. Its greatest strength lay in the accompanying maps, for it was thought these would show best the results of geographic exploration. In an age hungry for adventure, but not yet totally scientifically literate, this was the best way to attract the largest possible group of interested readers. The maps not only supplemented several of the Perthes atlases, but were also used as a forum to elaborate on new themes, thus widening the thematic scope of cartography. He expresses his emphasis on maps anew when he writes in the &quot;Geographisches Jahrbuch&quot;:

&quot;In first instance the end result and final goal of all geographic investigations, explorations, and surveys is the depiction of the earth’s surface: the map. The map is the basis for geography. The map shows us what we know about our earth in the best, clearest and most exact way. The contemporary map should so depict the earth’s surface that one can not only measure the horizontal positions of and distances between all points and localities, but also clearly distinguish vertical variations, from sea level to the highest summits.&quot;

Petermann was responsible for drawing most of the maps in the first few years of the journal. His strength was in the analysis and evaluation of all sources available. As such one can say that the indication &#x27;Originalkarte&#x27; (original map) in many titles was well earned, for few slavishly copied what explorers or other experts had sketched. German geographers, like Hermann Wagner (1840–1929), claimed that in other geographical journals explorer&#x27;s maps were just copied instead of having them evaluated by cartographers first. Maps based on recent exploration reports were always, when possible, complemented with route maps from previous expeditions. He did not like to infer or extrapolate from the sources, for that might give inaccurate measurements, so many of his maps show large blank spaces. How right he was in this respect was demonstrated in 1911 when Julien Thoulet drafted bathymetric maps for the territory of France. In these four maps he draws hypothetical isobaths, which are based on respectively 15, 31, 154, and 308 altitude measurements per for France and the adjacent territories. (A reasonable number of measuring points for precipitation and temperature maps would be 1,500 and 600 per 100,000 km² respectively to create acceptable isoline maps for these phenomena). These give schematic negative relief maps, which hardly even approximate the true relief of the territory. Thoulet wanted to show that the few bathymetric measurements available for the vast oceans would only vaguely approximate the true relief of the ocean floors. Petermann must have had the same idea intuitively for his exploratory maps. He was keen, however, to introduce spot heights and spot depths in the maps he drafted so that others could benefit from them.

===Technical innovations===
Having understood well from his teacher, Heinrich Berghaus, the merit of the metric scale he introduced the representative fraction as map scale, without discarding, however, the verbal better known or local scale. The popular acceptance of the metric system and Greenwich as prime meridian was slower in the uptake. Only with the ninth edition of Stieler&#x27;s Hand-Atlas (1900–1905) was this process completed.

In 1870, Petermann advocated the use of a red and blue color scheme for temperature maps of the oceans. Although the number of projection methods increased at a reasonable rate, a few well-known sorts, like the stereographic and orthographic equatorial projections and the projections of Lambert, Flamsteed and Mercator, remained the most popular. Petermann did publish reports on the new projection methods of J. Babinet (1854) and J. James (1857), and G. Jäger, but he hardly used them. Though Petermann and Ernst Behm (1830–1884; like many of the famous Gothaer geographers and cartographers Behm had first another profession. He was a physician, who learned the geographic trade in practice) wrote many articles about geodesy and surveying, they rarely got involved in other technical and theoretical cartographic issues.
Petermann concerned himself much more with printing technology, especially colour-lithography. Although they produced many color maps in this way in the 1870s, more and more maps returned to hand coloring, for it then became cheaper than lithography. According to Stams, the Gotha Institute may have produced some 2,500,000 hand-colored maps for all its cartographic products in a decade, or 800 per day! In his last article published before his death, Petermann speaks enthusiastically about the newly developed photogravure, which considerably reduced costs per map while also increasing production speed. In his opinion the 715-sheet Austrian map was probably twenty times more efficiently produced than an engraved version would have been, for its production took only a fifth of the time and a fourth of the costs.
In 1857 the President of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Roderick Murchison, praised PGM for its fast reporting of diverse explorations, and spoke against the jealousy of those in his own Society who felt that exploration supported primarily by the British should first be published in Britain: he thought the Perthes Institute enriched the scientific geographic discourse.

===&#x27;Petermann school&#x27; also known as &#x27;Gotha school&#x27;===
Since he was not appointed head of the Perthes establishment Petermann could only guide the other skills available. Fortunately he could call on cartographers and engravers who had developed their skills through long experience with men like Adolf Stieler, Stülpnagel, Heinrich Berghaus, Emil von Sydow, etc., as well as new cartographers like Carl Vogel and Hermann Berghaus. According to Hermann Wagner it was not felt wise to have any of these employees appointed as head of the establishment. Instead the firm was led by Adolf Müller, not a cartographer, but an economic manager.

The cartographers Petermann trained included Bruno Hassenstein (1839–1902), Hermann Habenicht (1844–1917, who from 1897 onwards trained Hermann Haack, the 20th-century editor of PGM), Ernst Debes (1840–1923. He could have come to rival Carl Vogel, but in 1868 he left the Gotha Institute to co-found his own firm, [Heinrich] Wagner &amp; Debes, which published one of the six famous families of German reference atlases &quot;E. Debes neuer Handatlas&quot;, later called &quot;Grosser Columbus Weltatlas&quot;), Carl Barich, Arnim Welcker (1840–1859), Ludwig Friederichsen (who worked on the Stieler and PGM from 1859 to 1863, and later founded the geographical society of Hamburg and became very active in German colonial politics.) in the 1850s, and Fritz Hanemann (1847–1877), Christian Peip (1843–1922), Bruno Domann and Otto Koffmahn (1851–1916) in the 1860s. They soon learned to produce maps as good as their teacher&#x27;s, and eventually even better. But they had probably listened well when Petermann pointed out the need for an improvement in map lettering, in elevation figures (though elevation and bathymetric figures were common in topographic maps and charts, Petermann was the first to include them in geographic maps), more accurate engraving and better coloring, for under his directions the maps of the Stieler became more uniform in expression. In this they were also guided by the more than consistent work of Vogel, and Von Sydow&#x27;s critical remarks concerning the advantages and disadvantages of certain styles in his &quot;Kartographischen Standpunkt Europas&quot;.

Petermann was also keen to use physical characteristics as background for thematic maps, an idea followed by his pupils. When Herbert Louis demanded in 1960 that the terrain underlying thematic maps should indicate elevations, hydrological networks, settlements and traffic roads, he cited Petermann as the first cartographer who used a terrain map as basis for population maps. By using hachuring as a basis for his &quot;Karte des Österreichischen Kaiserstaates zur Übersicht der Dichtigkeit der Bevölkerung nach dem Census von 1857&quot; (Map of the Austrian imperial state as an overview of the population density after the 1857 census, 1860) and the map &quot;Die Ausdehnung der Slaven in der Türkei und den angrenzenden Gebieten&quot; (Expansion of the Slavic populations in Turkey and adjacent territories, 1869) Petermann continued the representation of geological, climatological and ethnographical data that his teacher Heinrich Berghaus had begun two decades before.

===Sections===
From the start, the journal contained small messages concerning developments in geography under the heading &quot;Geographische Notizen/Monatsbericht&quot; (1855–...). Some of these were concerned with recently published literature, mainly book citations. In 1860 Petermann decided that these should be listed in a more structured way, the latter temporarily as Geographischer Literatur Bericht für ****(1886–1909), maybe inspired by Kroner&#x27;s literature lists in the &quot;Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde&quot; of the &#x27;Gesellschaft für Erdkunde&#x27;. Books and maps would not merely be listed, but also reviewed, if they were part of the Perthes library. Unlike most listings it would also cover articles from the main journals, for these, he noted, were the primary sources reflecting the most recent developments in geography. This would keep the readers of PGM up to date.
Other sections of the journal were: &quot;Geographische Nekrologie des Jahres ****&quot; (1858–1884), &quot;Geographie und Erforschung Polar-Regionen&quot; (nr. 51/1871-nr. 135/1878), &quot;Monatsbericht über Entdeckungsgeschichte und Kolonisation&quot; (1885), &quot;Kleinere Mitteilungen&quot; (1889–1939), &quot;Geographischer Anzeiger&quot; (1899–1902), &quot;Kartographischer Monatsbericht aus Justus Perthes&#x27; Geographischer Anstalt in Gotha&quot; (1908–1911), &quot;Militärkartographie&quot; (1909–1914), &quot;Staaten und Völker&quot; (1923), &quot;Neue Forschung im Felde&quot; (1935–1939), &quot;(Wehr- und) Militärgeographie&quot; (1935–1936), &quot;Kartographie&quot; (1941–1945).

==Mapping the unknown==
Though Petermanns name appears on hundreds of maps, Wagner suggests he stopped drafting maps himself after 1862. The report concerning the Nordenskiöld voyage to the Lena, and the maps of the United States and Australia, suggest this may not be true. Perhaps he no longer designed, constructed and drafted the maps, as he had with the Barth maps, but he most likely continued to play a role in the conception and design of the maps, especially those in his fields of interest.

Petermann was very well aware that even topographic maps were not yet a true representation of reality (this is illustrated by the depiction of the Liparian Isles, which were not securely situated until Darondeau&#x27;s French survey in 1858), let alone medium- and small-scale maps of the interior of continents and the polar regions. One could still hardly speak of dense topographic, orographic and hydrological information. Though the maps in the Stieler looked dense with information, they were mainly filled out with information where space in the image allowed, and the cartographers had little choice what to depict by the lack of known phenomena. The density of information did not indicate how thoroughly an area had been explored, for the cartographers selected their data and drafted the maps in such a way as to give a balanced image as possible. As Petermann put it in 1866:

&quot;In fact, our cartographic knowledge of the territories of the earth is far less than is generally supposed. ... [In the maps,] even the African and Australian terrae incognitae shrink more and more, and there remain [only] a few blank spots, maybe &#x27;wild territories&#x27;, where there is &#x27;nothing&#x27;. In reality everything we see on our maps is just the first step, the beginning of a more accurate knowledge of the earth’s surface.&quot;

Only in the detailed maps in PGM, where many spaces were left blank, could one really judge how haphazard and incomplete the geographic knowledge was. J.G. Bartholomew in 1902 phrased Petermann&#x27;s drive as: &quot;The filling up of the blank spaces of the unknown in his maps had such a fascination for him that rest seemed impossible to him while any country remained unexplored&quot;.

The results of the exploratory expeditions cried out for presentation in map form, and PGM published exploration results as quickly and accurately as possible. Petermann had all results he received from explorers checked against the considerable information and maps available in the Perthes Institute. This fund of knowledge grew to be so large that the Institute soon had a large library of manuscripts, books, atlases, and maps at its disposal that could vie with any university or society collection. In the 1980s it was thought that the Perthes-archives contained 180,000 printed maps and around 2,800 atlases. In the 1990s the estimate was 1,000 m of archive, some 400,000 maps (including manuscripts), and some 120,000 geographical works. All collections (currently estimated at 185,000 sheets of maps, 120,000 geographical works, and 800 m of archives) were acquired in 2003 by the Free State of Thüringen and deposited with the library of the University of Erfurt in its research center in Gotha.

But the maps went beyond a simple presentation of the itinerary by also describing the area explored with all knowledge available and pointing out gaps that remained to be filled in the current knowledge. So the impact was reciprocal. Moreover, Petermann gave directions to explorers in exchange for which he was allowed to publish their results as soon as possible.

===Richardson&#x27;s African expedition===
The influence Petermann tried to wield, even as a young man, can best be illustrated by his interference, together with Bunsen and Ritter, on behalf of Heinrich Barth, who wished to take part in the Richardson expedition. He later also persuaded the English government to send Eduard Vogel after them for scientific research and astronomical observations. Petermann published the results under the title &quot;Account of the expedition to Central-Africa&quot;. When first Barth and later Vogel failed to return at the expected time Germany frantically tried to discover their fate, much as Britain had with Franklin in the Arctic area. This led to many new German expeditions to Africa (by Theodor von Heuglin, Hermann Steudner, Theodor Kinzelbach, Karl Moritz von Beurmann, Gerhard Rohlfs, Karl Mauch and others), most financed by gifts due largely to Petermann&#x27;s agitating actions and publications. Many found their death in Africa as shown in the map with the subtitle &quot;Four martyrs of German science in Inner-Africa&quot; shows, i.c. Overweg, Vogel, Beurmann and Steudner.

Petermann first drafted maps of Barth &amp; Overweg&#x27;s routes for the journal of the German Geographical Society and followed these up with maps in PGM in 1855, 1857, and 1859. These were later worked into the maps for Barth&#x27;s voluminous work on his African voyage of 1850–55. The route maps were used in new maps up to 1893.
When we compare the maps in Barth&#x27;s work and in PGM we may get an idea of how the information was turned into images. The first map in Barth&#x27;s work gives an overview of his routes. The routes of Livingstone have already been engraved, but have not been highlighted by coloring. The 1857 issue of PGM uses the same copperplate, but with both routes highlighted and another title. Sheets 2–14 of Barth&#x27;s work are route maps on the scale 1:800,000 and 1:1,000,000. In 1855 PGM gives only a summary of the routes of the first half of the total tour, on scale of 1:2,100,000, with added profiles along the borders that do not appear on the detail maps. This was a corrected issue of a map first published in London. In the 1857 issue the map of Touareg-country is a copy, but mainly uncolored. Maps 15 and 16 of Barth&#x27;s work form a beautifully drafted and colored two-sheet map at a scale of 1:6,000,000 and measures 57 x 85 cm. It depicts the approximate territories of the indigenous tribes. The other maps in the 1857 issue show rather small details of the routes, not beautifully executed, while in the text a plan of Agades is inserted (I do not know if it exists in Barth&#x27;s work). All in all, there is little overlap, also because the scales used for the different works are mostly different. But the smaller maps are clearly generalizations of the maps in Barth&#x27;s work. The images in Barth&#x27;s look sharper, but of course that is also because they are engraved on a larger scale, while all the areas outside the routes, of which nothing or not enough is known are blank.
These routes, like many others, were reused in many new maps, such as Barth&#x27;s route, supplemented with the 1828 routes of René-Auguste Caillé (1799–1838) and Léopold Planet (1850).

===Invitation for exploring Africa===
PGM not only reported the findings of explorers but also was proactive in instigating new explorations. &quot;Ergänzungsband II&quot; of 1863 contains a 10-part map (210x102 cm) of Africa (&quot;Karte von Inner-Afrika&quot;, that contained all routes of explorers between 1701 and 1863. The most important parts of the map are the blank areas, hoping that they would stimulate explorers to go on expeditions to find out what new things there could be. But it was also a case of marketing PGM, as shown in the memoire that accompanied the map, where Petermann wrote:

&quot;The basic idea of our map was to give travellers a sure support for the choice of their routes and guarantee the direction of the explorations, to resolve doubts and stimulate the elucidation of the unknown, and to offer a means for friends at home to follow their moves and to judge the value of their labour. This by creating a cartographic representation of the least known central regions of Africa utilizing all material at hand as completely as possible, to display the range of our contemporary knowledge as well as the way this knowledge is acquired and the degree of its reliability.&quot;

===Arctic explorations===
Petermann spent a lot of time on the active promotion of his exploratory missions, especially the polar regions. For this he wrote more articles than for any of his other ventures. Up to 1871 he published seventeen maps of the Arctic and Antarctic in the regular issues and eight in the &#x27;supplement&#x27; issues. He began publishing notices on the geography and exploration of the polar regions in PGM 38, 1871 (&quot;Geographie und Erforschung der Polar-Regionen&quot; started in 1865 and nos. 51–135 appeared in PGM volumes 16, 1871 to 23, 1878), and from that time onwards 195 maps covered the polar regions, but none appeared in the supplements of that period. He actually started to push his interest in this subject in the 1865 issue of PGM and with the publication of supplement 16 (Ergänzungsband IV) in 1865. In the PGM-issue he recites the correspondence he has with the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) concerning the proposal of capt. Sherard Osborn (1822–1875) to send another English expedition to the North pole starting from Baffin Bay. In several articles he tries to persuade the RGS to support his plan to start the expedition from Spitsbergen and use steamships instead of sledges for transport. In one article he stresses his love for Arctic expeditions by reminiscing: &quot;Who, like us, e.g. has attended the accounts of one capt. Inglefield (Edward Augustus Inglefield (1820–1894)) during the session of the Royal Geographical Society of London on 22 November 1852, would be persuaded to know that the natural beauty of the Arctic regions cannot be surpassed by any other in the world.&quot; Though the accompanying map shows his theory concerning an extended Greenland he doesn&#x27;t write about this, but mainly about his errouneous theory concerning the behavior of the Gulf Stream. Supplement IV gives an overview of the knowledge of the area around Spitsbergen and the central Arctic. It contains articles by Petermann, R. Werner, N. Dunér and A.E. Nordenskiöld, Dr. Malmgrén, Barto von Löwenigh, and G. Jäger, and is accompanied by three maps. Petermann published this supplement issue to encourage people and institutes to support German efforts to explore the central Arctic. The first map, scale 1:40,000,000 covers both the Arctic and Antarctica, with the routes of the explorers from Cook to 1861. He measures the unexplored area in the Arctic as 140,000 German square miles (approximately 7,700,000 km²), comparing it to Australia&#x27;s total of 138,000. The unexplored Antarctic he calculates as 396,000 German square miles (approximately 21,800,000 km²). Petermann uses the map specifically to show the benefits of using ships for exploration, rather than the sledges usually used by the Americans and the British. He must have been convinced that the central Arctic contained vast expanses of open water and land, the latter presumably extensions of Greenland and Spitsbergen. Though the routes in the Antarctic map have been engraved, they are not highlighted in color. Instead Petermann has colored the polygons that encompass the areas covered by the several explorers. This highlights the unexplored area clearly, even though it is blank. But Petermann is definitely more interested in having the Germans explore the Arctic than the Antarctic, presumably because the costs of an Arctic expedition can be met more easily than those of an Antarctic one. The more detailed map of Spitsbergen not only shows the Swedish surveys of 1861 to 1864, but also the presence of coal fields, coastal areas with driftwood, and areas where reindeer can normally be found. Petermann&#x27;s last map is in the modified polar projection first proposed by G. Jäger of Vienna. Jäger had developed this projection specifically to facilitate the palaeontological analysis of the inventory of animal life in the Arctic area. Petermann thought this the best projection for planning the laying of telegraph lines.

====North-East passage====
He not only promoted explorations, but also actively collected funds to realize them, and gave an account of the receipts and expenditures in several issues of PGM. In 1865, Otto Volger of the FDH (Freies Deutsches Hochstift für Wissenschaft, Künste und allgemeine Bildung, founded in 1859) organised the &#x27;Allgemeine Deutsche Versammlung von Freunden der Erdkunde&#x27; (General German Assembly of Friends of Geography). During this two-day meeting Georg von Neumayer stressed the fact that Germany needed a German maritime institute to be independent of other nations. One of the programmed issues to be discussed was the issue of guidelines for the use of a homogeneous meteorological logbook for the German merchant navy. In later years the maps in PGM made much use of the data thus gathered. Petermann jealously reported on the marine surveys in Britain and America, which were realized with governmental support, and he dearly wished such was possible in other nations, especially Germany. Furthermore, he pointed out that Germany had much to gain by exploring the Arctic region, especially the Northeast Passage, since the English and Americans were concentrating on the Northwest Passage. Though he even tried to get Bismarck involved in an Arctic exploration project, it was shelved for some time because of the Austro-Prussian War and the consequent expansion of the Prussian realm. In PGM that same year, he again turned to the FDH for support. In 1868 Petermann roused so much support for his idea in the German public that his Arctic expedition actually took place.

He proposed to follow a course east of Greenland, for he and other geographers were convinced that Greenland stretched much farther North than was known in that time. Though Ferdinand von Wrangel started a four-year-long expedition in 1820 to find possible land north of Cape Shelagskiy and could not find any land, he noted a Chukchi chief saying: &quot;One might in a clear summer&#x27;s day descry snow-covered mountains at a great distance to the north.&quot; Heinrich Berghaus, Petermann&#x27;s teacher, included this information in the right hand corner on his isotherm map of 1838 for his &quot;Physikalische Atlas&quot; with the text &#x27;possible polar land&#x27; [Wahrscheinliches Polar-Land]. So it might be that Petermann based his views on this information.

He published the same map of the Arctic and Antarctic as in 1865, but now with Greenland stretching over the Arctic and ending in Wrangel Island close to the Bering Strait. It shows the possible route of the German expedition. The Antarctic map now uses only two colors to delimit the areas covered by James Cook and others. Later in that volume he published two maps of the route sailed by the German expedition. Unfortunately, they discovered a finger of permanent pack ice stretching from the north to approximately 76°, which made progress further north impossible. Petermann was undaunted in his endeavors to reach the North Pole and demonstrate a possible passage to the Pacific Ocean, even after this expedition had failed in that respect. In 1869 he published a map of the Arctic Ocean north of Wrangel Island with all exploration routes between 1648 and 1867 and a map with sea-temperatures in the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea as observed by the German expedition, and again two maps of the German expedition in Ergänzungsheft 28.

In 1874 he again published an overview map of the Arctic at a scale of 1:16,000,000, this time with exploration routes from 1616 to the end of 1874, complemented by the new meteorological weather stations. Strangely enough, the route of the 1868 German expedition is not engraved in the image. Petermann still believed however, that Greenland stretched far into the Polar region. The text in the map reads: &#x27;Unerforscht, wahrscheinlich Land oder Inseln (Petermann&#x27;s Hypothese)&#x27; [unexplored, probably land or islands (Petermann&#x27;s hypothesis)].

In the case of the polar regions, Petermann&#x27;s point of view deviated from most contemporary views. While many, especially the Americans and British, saw a possible passage in the Northwest, where they expected to find a passage after rounding Greenland, Petermann thought this not a viable option. But this did not prevent him from publishing many reports and maps of the American and British explorations in this area, sometimes translated from the journal of the Royal Geographical Society and other geographical societies. Though he was right in hypothesizing that the warm Gulf Stream complemented the cold Labrador Stream and that the warm stream extended far north of Spitsbergen and Nova Zembla, his thesis that it warmed the Arctic needed serious revision. Although he thought it to be a deep stream, he overestimated the effect of the warmth from that depth on surface ice east of Svalbard. On the other hand, he was wrong about the extension of Greenland. He wrote:

&quot;... but such an enormous glacier like the one named after Von Humboldt points at extensive eternal snow and glacier regions and this speaks for an extension of Greenland to the North ...&quot;

His view may have been reinforced by some explorers who sighted land at higher latitudes than the tip of Greenland.
While Petermann was honored in 1876 by the American Geographical Society, during the last of 3 weeks visiting the US, Dr. Isaac I. Hayes disputed the hypothesis of Petermann&#x27;s land tongue stretching from Greenland to the Bering Sea, though he agreed that the Arctic Ocean would possibly have open water.

The Northwest Passage indeed proved to be challenging. Only in 1904 did Roald Amundsen achieve its navigation. As to the Northeast Passage, Nordenskiöld&#x27;s trip to the Yenisei river in 1875 hinted at this being the easier route. The successful completion of the passage during Nordenskiöld&#x27;s expedition with the steamship &quot;Vega&quot; was published in 1879 in PGM shortly after Petermann&#x27;s death. The map was drafted on top of Petermann&#x27;s 1873 map of Siberia. The route of the &quot;Vega&quot; had also appeared on a Russian copy of Petermann&#x27;s 1873 map. The PGM editors also added it in their 1879 map. This might have been a way to honour Petermann. The map shows clearly to what degree the descriptive data of older explorations (i.e. Vasili Pronchishchev, 1735–36; Hariton Laptev, 1739–43; Semyon Čeluskin, 1735–43; Fyodor Minin and Dmitriy Sterlegov, 1740; and Alexander Theodor von Middendorff, 1843) could be trusted when drafting a map from many sources and trying to amalgamate them into a single image. The difference between the coastlines on the two maps sometimes can be as much as ½° latitude and 1° longitude. Looking at the Taimyr peninsula, the channel between it and the mainland is reduced from approximately 10 km to a few kilometres by the Swedish exploration. The only exception was the information derived from P.F. Anjou (1823), which was based on astronomical observations, and is the same in both maps. The article (translations from Swedish and Danish with a preamble by Behm) and map appeared four months after the &quot;Vega&quot; had arrived in Irkutsk. Hassenstein drafted the new map, maybe using the older draft. The title was hammered out of the old copperplate and replaced by a new one, while Nordenskiöld&#x27;s data were engraved, and printed in red, making it look like an overlay on the old map. Because of the use of lighter background colors the newer map looks much fresher than the older one, though only six years lay between the two.

===Australia===
Petermann kept his promise, made in the preface of the first issue of PGM, when he was responsible for the new edition of Stieler&#x27;s Hand-Atlas. He also had a weakness for Australia. Up to his death he published some 48 maps concerning exploration in (parts of) Australia, though hardly any of the expeditions bore any German influence. In 1866, when he gave an account of the first issue of the fifth edition (1866–67) of the Stieler, he frequently referred to maps or articles published in PGM. Furthermore, he mentions that he is working on four other maps of Australia or parts of it. One of these is his famous eight-sheet map of Australia, scale 1:3,500,000, and the other three are concerned with exploration or based on land-property maps. (&quot;Spezialkarte von Neu-Süd-Wales nach den Kataster-Aufnahmen&quot;, later published as &quot;Spezialkarte eines Theiles von New South Wales&quot; (PGM, 12, 1866, table 13); &quot;Spezialkarte vom See’ngebiet im Inneren von Australien&quot;, later published as &quot;Das See’n-Gebiet (Lake District) und die Steinige Wüste (Great Stony Desert) im Innern von Australien&quot; (PGM, 13, 1867, table 4); &quot;Karte der Entdeckungen im Inneren Australiens, scale 1:2,500,000&quot;, which he probably chose not to publish in PGM due to all the new discoveries). In 1871/72 he published the eight-sheet map as Specialkarte von Australien in 8 Blättern in Ergänzungsheft 29 (volume VI) and 30 (volume VII). It is a superb effort to compile all available knowledge in a colored map-image that measures 194x118 cm altogether, and it reminds us of the ten-sheet map of Africa of 1863. Being Petermann he would have liked to have accompanied it with a volume containing its ten-year history of exploration and discoveries, but in order not to raise the retail price of the map he satisfied himself with merely citing the volumes of PGM where the information could be found and providing an accompanying 43-page geographical-statistical compendium by C.E. Meinicke. In 1875 a second revised edition appeared, with a small sample in PGM.
We unfortunately do not find his famous six-sheet map of the United States (&quot;Neue Karte der Vereinigten Staaten vor Nord-Amerika in 6 Blättern&quot;) in the issues of PGM. It was produced for the sixth edition of the Stieler on scale 1:3,700.000, though a small part appeared in the next annual as an illustration of the exploration of Northwest Texas.

===Source interpretations===
Several times Petermann indicated that he disagreed with the reports of explorers, probably basing his arguments on reports and literature at his disposal or on sound geographic reasoning. In a map, concerning among other things lake Uniamesi, he tends to disagree with Jakob Erhardt, one of the missionaries of the Church Mission Society of London, concerning its situation and extension. Erhardt was erroneous in that he situated the lower tip of the lake around 13° South 36° East and made it bend westward to 28° East, with a probable extension to 24° East. Furthermore, he thought that Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyassa were one inland sea extending to 6° North. A lack of data led Petermann to agree with his erroneous shape of the lake or lakes, but he was not convinced of its wide extension to the west and north. As for the sources of the Nile he was not so much mistaken, as they were indicated by a text near the equator between 30° and 36° East, but this was not so hard to induce. When one views the ethnographic and trade information in the map and interprets them from a relative topological point of view we can see this as the strength of the missionaries&#x27; reports. As their mission was focused on people and not on the natural environment this kind of information was of great importance to them. But geometrically their information could not be trusted, in part because most of their information was based on verbal reports of the native tribes.

At other times he depicted maps of the same area from several authors together in one supplement map to show the authors&#x27; different interpretations. This was the case with, for example, the map of the Kerguelen and McDonald Islands sighted by John Heard (1853), William MacDonald (1854), Hutton (1854), Attway (1854), Rees (1854), and Neumayer (1857), with several comparisons of explorations since James Cook. The same with small maps (scale ca. 1:33,000,000) of the central part of southern Africa, which shows different interpretations by Heinrich Kiepert (1855), J. McQueen (1857) and David Livingstone (1857). Or with the representation of the Gabon countries, which show interpretations by August Petermann, Thomas E. Bowdich, William D. Cooley, Heinrich Kiepert, Paul Belloni du Chaillu and Heinrich Barth.

Many times he included an outline map of Germany, or parts thereof or other countries to show the vastness through which the explorers had to travel. This must have contributed to the understanding and compassion the readers felt for the sacrifice and hardships the explorers had to go through to come to the results presented in the articles and maps.

==Stieler-Handatlas==
Since the first edition Friedrich von Stülpnagel had been mainly responsible for the drafting of the maps of Stieler-Handatlas. When Stülpnagel died in 1865 Petermann became responsible for the Stieler. He drafted some maps (e.g. &quot;Russland und Skandinavien&quot;, &quot;Süd-Polar Karte&quot;, &quot;Neu-Seeland&quot;, &quot;Australien&quot;, &quot;Süd-Ost Australien&quot; ) for the 4th edition (1863–1867), which reached 83 maps. In the 5th edition (1868–1874) we can see the hand of the master clearer, as the maps become more uniform and the style of the &#x27;Gotha School&#x27; becomes more distinct.

==Fame for the armchair traveller==
Petermann was sometimes accused of being an &#x27;armchair&#x27; geographer as he never traveled wide or experienced new discoveries with his own eyes, but the quality of the maps and geographic ideas he produced proves the accusation unfair. Some people are better at observing and describing circumstances and phenomena, others are better at interpretation of data. Petermann&#x27;s greatest accomplishment lay in the interpretation and evaluation of sometimes contradictory sources, and his great legacy is that he was able to develop this faculty in most of his pupils in such a fine way that geography at large has profited from it ever since. Should one criticize the journal under his direction for not being geographically innovative then one may come nearer to the truth. Many articles are of a descriptive physical nature, with many intimate details in the explorers&#x27; colloquial style, and hardly any tries to find explanations for the physical phenomena. Most emphasis is laid on geomorphology and geology — old disciplines by then with their own technical language already — meteorology, botany and biology. Articles on anthropogeography usually reach no further than ethnographic descriptions of regions. It is still the era of data-gathering and in this they were not far beyond the cameralistic nature of the first half of the nineteenth century. One should have expected more articles concerning (parts of) Europe, but a count in the annuals for 1860–1864 shows that only 16% of the articles and 22% of the &quot;Kleinere Mitteilungen&quot; (small communications) concerned Europe. As accommodation one might say that the journal, though geographic by nature, was aimed at popular use. That was one of its strengths, as shown by its large circulation.

&quot;Petermann’s achievement falls in a period in which raw material was gathered, especially through explorations. It was the flowering of geographic dilettantism. Interest was not only stirred by news as such, but the news in itself was interesting, because every educated person without special prior knowledge could understand it.&quot;

According to Weller, Petermann signed 226 articles in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, including 41 on Africa, 98 on the Polar regions and 37 on the history and use of cartography. The same source puts his total production of maps at 535, including his maps for the Stieler, the Physical atlas and several miscellaneous items. Stams, using the ten-year indexes, counts 280 maps in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen that can be said to have been constructed and edited by him.

==Slipping and death==
At the end of the 1870s geography started to change its objects and goals, which upset the previously important position of what was then called the &#x27;Gotha Academy&#x27;. When Charles Darwin published &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; it was the beginning of the expansion of human geography, which till then was only rarely focused upon, except in the field of ethnography. The physical-deterministic view of humanity that followed led to the rise of the branch of geography we now call anthropogeography, especially after 1875, when Friedrich Ratzel (1844–1904) was the first new professor of geography appointed in München and later Leipzig (only Carl Ritter ever before had been professor of geography worldwide).

In 1856 Petermann had married Clara Leslie and had two daughters with her. They were divorced in 1875. A year later he married for the second time. As time wore on he seemed to have suffered more and more from family problems. It is also supposed that for many years he suffered from manic-depressive moods and he seemed to have always kept a revolver in close proximity.
All these changes and troubles may have contributed to the fact that Petermann died by his own hand at Gotha on 25 September 1878. The fact that Gotha was becoming less exclusively the center of exploration – which so enchanted the large masses—and became more scientifically focused might also have played a role.
In 1902 J.G. Bartholomew wrote: &quot;It is only a fair tribute to Augustus Petermann to say that no one has done more than he to advance modern cartography, and no man has ever left a more fitting monument to himself than his &quot;Mitteilungen&quot;, which still bears his name, and under the editorship of Dr. Supan, is the leading geographical authority in all countries. But to the absorbing fascination of his work Petermann sacrificed all other interests in life and died a martyr to geography&quot;. That fame perished quickly was shown by Hermann Wagner in his article of 1912, when he commemorates the merits of the Gotha epoch under Petermann and finds that nobody up till then had written about the making of the history of geography and cartography and that all those pioneers were all but forgotten, even though the journal carried Petermann&#x27;s name since 1879.
In 1909 a monument with Petermann&#x27;s effigy from the workshop of Max Hoene-München of Gotha was erected in the Ducal gardens of Gotha, a stone&#x27;s throw away from the institute where he had worked for so many years. The monument was offered by the German geographical societies. Petermann in his time was well paid by Perthes as is shown by his beautiful villa close to Gotha&#x27;s railway station.

==Legacy==
Because Petermann provided so much supporting work during his lifetime, several physical features, especially in the Arctic, were named after him. In the NIMA-database the following seven toponyms are listed: Petermann Ranges (Antarctica), Petermann Island, also in Antarctica, Petermann Ranges (Australia), Petermann Peak, Petermann Fjord, Petermann Glacier, Petermann Peninsula, Kapp Petermann. According to Hugo Wichmann, Capt. Bullock was probably the first to name a physical feature after Petermann, on a printed English chart of 1860. In the same report he counts thirteen features in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Arctic and Antarctic regions, named between 1860 and 1874. Some of them were renamed by other explorers and one turned out not to exist. Petermann Land, which Julius Payer thought to have sighted from Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land, later proved nonexistent. A crater on the Moon was given the name Petermann crater, situated halfway between Mare Humboldtianum and Peary in the northern polar region.

Petermann thought that the naming of newly discovered physical features was one of the privileges of a map-editor, especially as he was fed up with encountering toponyms like &#x27;Victoria&#x27;, &#x27;Wellington&#x27;, &#x27;Smith&#x27;, &#x27;Jones&#x27;, etc. He writes: &quot;While constructing the new map to specify the detailed topographical portrayal and after consulting with and authorization of messr. [Theodor] v[on] Heuglin and count Karl Graf von Waldburg-Zeil I have entered 118 names in the map: partly they are the names derived from celebrities of arctic explorations and discoveries, arctic travellers anyway as well as excellent friends, patrons, and participants of different nationalities in the newest northpolar expeditions, partly eminent German travellers in Africa, Australia, America ...&quot; So the accompanying map of Svalbard is larded with features named after Barth, Behm, Berghaus, Bessel, Brehm, Breusing, Heuglin, Hochstetter, Koldewey, Lange, Mauch, Oetker, Payer, Perthes, Petermann, Ravenstein, Weyprecht, and Wilhelm.

==The end of an era==
In 1992 Justus Perthes Verlag, the publisher of PGM, was taken over by Ernst Klett Schulbuchverlag in Stuttgart, altogether with &#x27;Justus Perthes Geographische Verlagsanstalt Darmstadt&#x27; (1953-1994). Ernst Klett Verlag continued to run the Perthes publishing house until 2016 in Gotha. In 2003 the Perthes archives (185,000 maps, incl. abt. 11,000 sea charts and abt. 4,000 large size school wall maps, 120,000 geographic publications incl. a few thousand atlases, and 800 m of business archives) were bought by the Free State of Thüringen. In 2004, after 149 years of publication, the journal &quot;Petermann’s Geographische Mitteilungen&quot; ceased to be published. The municipality of Gotha bought in 2010 the former business premises and the accompanying grounds on Justus-Perthes-Strasse 1–9 and Gotthardstrasse 6. Since 2015, the huge Perthes archive is located at Perthesforum in Gotha, one of the most modern archive facilities in Germany, with around 11,000 square meters of total space for multiple users. The investment in what was then &quot;Thuringia&#x27;s largest cultural project&quot; amounted to more than 18 million euros. built with funding from the EU, the German federal government and the Thuringian state government. The Perthes family villa at Gotthardstrasse nevertheless was demolished in July 2012 for lack of development options.
Many of the letters Petermann sent or received have been saved for future study, as also are the drafts he made for many maps, and are kept in the Perthes Collection of the University of Erfurt Gotha Research Library at &#x27;Perthesforum&#x27;.

<doc id="1168800" wikidata="Q1150781" url="?curid=1168800" title="Carpentras (composer)">
<text>Carpentras (also Elzéar Genet, Eliziari Geneti) (ca. 1470 – June 14, 1548) was a French composer of the Renaissance. He was famous during his lifetime, and was especially notable for his settings of the Lamentations which remained in the repertory of the Papal Choir throughout the 16th century. In addition, he was probably the most prominent Avignon musician since the time of the ars subtilior at the end of the 14th century.

==Life==
He was born in the town of Carpentras, but nothing else is known about his early life. Sometime before 1505, he took ecclesiastical orders, since when he was hired in the Avignon chapel in that year he was called &quot;clericus.&quot; He spent most of his life alternately in Avignon and Rome.

Evidently he was acquainted with Avignon bishop Giuliano della Rovere, for when the bishop became Pope Julius II Carpentras went with him to Rome, where he sang in the papal chapel; he was listed in a roll of the singers there in 1508. However, after a few years he left the chapel to work at the court of Louis XII of France, though little is known about him at this time; clearly he was composing large quantities of secular music, some of it quite irreverent, for when he returned to Rome in 1513 he specifically promised to stop writing it. He became master of the papal chapel in 1514, now under the Medici Pope Leo X, who was an enthusiastic patron of music and the arts. When Leo X died in 1521, Carpentras fled Rome for Avignon; the new pope Adrian VI was uninterested in music, if not actively hostile, and many musicians gave him a &quot;walking ovation.&quot;

When Adrian VI died in 1523, the new pope, Clement VII, was again a fine patron of the arts, and Carpentras returned to Rome. While there he was surprised to discover his own music still being sung but in bastardized versions; as a result he carefully copied over some of his music, such as the pictured setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and presented this collection to Clement VII as the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;corrected&quot; version. However, he did not stay in Rome, and after only two years he departed for Avignon, this time for good.

In 1526 he became afflicted with tinnitus, a condition which terrified him, and which he described as a continuous hissing in his head. Apparently it was at this time that he withdrew from practical music-making and instead decided to devote himself to publishing his entire output of sacred music, an immense undertaking, and the earliest recorded such attempt in music history. The publication was troublesome; one of the printers failed to align the notes to staves correctly, and the entire process ended in arbitration at one point: however eventually, in the mid 1530s, he was able to issue four large collections of his music. Two of the volumes he dedicated to Pope Clement VII, and the other two to Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27;Medici.

He seems to have held several ecclesiastical positions in Avignon in the last two decades of his life, including the deanship of St. Agricole, and he died in that town in 1548.

==Works==
Carpentras composed several masses, numerous settings of the Magnificat, psalm settings, hymns, motets, and secular songs, as well as many settings of the Lamentations, which were his most famous work both during his lifetime and until 1587 when Palestrina was commissioned by the Counter-Reformation church to replace them. Stylistically, his music is typical of the generation after Josquin, smoothly polyphonic with pervasive imitation. Carpentras alternates points of imitation with homophonic sections, especially in his settings of the Lamentations.
