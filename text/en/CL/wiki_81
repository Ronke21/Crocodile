<doc id="1183281" wikidata="Q7416877" url="?curid=1183281" title="Bus 174 hijacking">
<text>On 12 June 2000, a bus was hijacked at gun-point by Sandro Barbosa do Nascimento in Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and hostages were held for 5 hours.

==Hijacking==
On Pentecost Monday, 12 June 2000, Nascimento boarded a public bus, line number 174 in Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro. He carried a .38 caliber revolver with the intention to rob the passengers. Moments after he announced the robbery, a passenger gestured to a passing Rio de Janeiro military police vehicle, prompting the officers to intercept the bus.

Nascimento proceeded to take the passengers hostage. The bus was soon surrounded by police, television crews and civilian onlookers. At first, Nascimento said he didn&#x27;t intend to kill anyone but demanded weapons and a new bus driver since the original driver had escaped through a window to ease Nascimento&#x27;s escape. As his demands were rejected, he threatened to kill a hostage at 6 p.m.

Nascimento singled out several hostages for dramatic threats, repeatedly using them as human shields. At about 7 p.m., he fired his revolver at the ground near Janaína Lopes Neves, who was on the floor, pretending to have shot her. He had previously told the other hostages to react as though she had been fatally shot.

Shortly afterwards, Nascimento exited the bus, using schoolteacher Geisa Firmo Gonçalves as a human shield. As he looked away, an officer with a submachine gun approached him from behind. Just prior to the officer reaching him, Nascimento turned directly toward the officer and reacted by jerking away from the officer and falling to the ground, taking Gonçalves with him. The officer reacted by continuing his advance and firing two or three shots at Nascimento while doing so. The first shot struck Gonçalves in the face; none of the other shots hit anyone. Nascimento fired three shots at Gonçalves, killing her. Officers converged on Nascimento and Gonçalves as they lay on the ground. Surrounding crowds rushed the area, with some intending to lynch him. Nascimento was immobilized and taken into police custody.

After being taken into custody, Nascimento died of asphyxiation. The officers who took him were charged with murder but were found not guilty after a jury trial. Rumors said Nascimento was intentionally killed by police in retaliation for the public nature of the hostage event.

Gonçalves was shot four times. Police reports said she was shot once in the face by the advancing police officer and then three times in the back by Nascimento in the ensuing struggle. The officer&#x27;s shot was ruled unintentional by a court.

== Perpetrator ==

Sandro Barbosa do Nascimento (7 July 1978 – 12 June 2000) was the perpetrator of the Bus 174 hostage crisis in Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He boarded the bus with the intent to rob the passengers but the incident turned into a hostage situation broadcast live by most Brazilian national television channels.

According to Nascimento&#x27;s relatives, he witnessed the murder of his mother. Shortly after the incident, he ran away from his home and lived on the streets.

At one point, Nascimento resided near Candelaria, a historical church in Rio de Janeiro, where he witnessed the Candelaria church massacre, in which Brazilian police killed eight minors and injured several others, on 23 July 1993. Nascimento was unharmed but cited the event as a reason for taking hostages on the bus.

==Bus route==
The number &quot;174&quot; was used to identify a specific bus route between Central do Brasil and Gávea. Due to the stigma caused by this incident, the route was rebadged as &quot;158&quot; in November 2001, then to &quot;143&quot;, and in February 2016 for &quot;Troncal 5&quot;.

==Films==
At least two films have been made depicting the events of the hostage crisis.

&quot;Bus 174&quot; (2002) retells the incident, discussing the life of Nascimento, and speculates on the social factors that led him to actions. The film contains a large amount of original video footage of the event, and recounts from several people surrounding the event, including the hostages, family of Nascimento, police officials, and news reporters.

&quot;Última Parada 174&quot; (2008) relates a fictionalized account of the life of Nascimento, street kid in Rio de Janeiro that survived the Candelaria massacre, and in 2000, hijacked a bus. On September 16, 2008 the film was chosen by the Ministry of Culture as the representative of Brazil in the Oscar competition for best foreign film at the ceremony in 2009.

<text>HM Prison Pentridge, better known as Pentridge Prison, was an Australian prison established in 1851 in Coburg, Victoria. The first convicts arrived at the gaol in 1851. The facility closed on 1 May 1997, although some of the heritage-listed buildings still stand.
Pentridge was often referred to as the &quot;Bluestone College&quot;, &quot;Coburg College&quot; or &quot;College of Knowledge&quot;. The grounds were originally landscaped by landscape gardener Hugh Linaker.
The site is split into two parts. The northern part of the prison, referred to as the &quot;Pentridge Coburg&quot; or &quot;Pentridge Piazza&quot; site, is bordered by Champ Street, Pentridge Boulevard, Murray Road and Stockade Avenue. It is under development by the developer Shayher Group, who has owned the site since 2013. The southern part of the prison, referred to as the &quot;Pentridge Village&quot; site, is bordered by Pentridge Boulevard, Stockade Avenue, Wardens Walk and Urquhart Street. It is partially owned by the developer, Future Estate. D Division is owned privately by Pentridge Cellars Pty Ltd.

== Divisions ==


The prison was split into divisions, named using letters of the alphabet.

* A – Short- and long-term prisoners of good behaviour. During the late 1980s, until its closure it became a scene of many monthly bashings, stabbings and bludgeonings.
* B – Long-term prisoners with behaviour problems
* C – Vagabonds and short-term prisoners, where infamous bushranger Ned Kelly was imprisoned. Demolished in the early 1970s.
* D – Remand prisoners
* E – The hospital, later turned into a dormitory division housing short-term prisoners
* F – Remand and short-term
* G – Psychiatric problems
* H – High security, discipline and protection
* J – Young Offenders Group. Later for long-term prisoners with record of good behaviour
*Jika Jika – maximum-security risk and for protection, later renamed K Division

=== Panopticons ===

In 2014, archaeological work in the former prison grounds led to the discovery of three rare panopticons (named after Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s prison design of 1791) located near the A and B Divisions that were built of bluestone in the 1850s. The first uncovered and excavated was to the north of A division. The circular design, with walls coming out from the centre, created wedge shaped &#x27;airing yards&#x27; where prisoners would be permitted access for one hour per day without coming into contact with each other. The panopticons fell out of use, due to prison overcrowding, and were largely demolished in the early 1900s. The panopticons were based on the design concepts of British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. The footings of the first panopticon that was excavated and uncovered is located to the north of A Division and remains relatively intact. The excavation and uncovering of the other two panopticons next to B Division only revealed the remains of its rubble footings.

=== Jika Jika high-security unit (K Division) ===
Jika Jika, opened in 1980 at a cost of A$7 million, was a &#x27;gaol within a gaol&#x27; maximum-security section, designed to house Victoria&#x27;s hardest and longest-serving prisoners. It was awarded the &#x27;Excellence in Concrete Award&#x27; by the Concrete Institute of Australia before being closed, eight years later, amidst controversy after the deaths of five prisoners in 1987.

The design of Jika Jika was based on the idea of six separate units at the end of radiating spines. The unit comprised electronic doors, closed-circuit TV and remote locking, designed to keep staff costs to a minimum and security to a maximum. The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in aviary-like escape-proof yards.

In 1983 four prisoners escaped from &#x27;escape-proof&#x27; Jika Jika. When two prison officers were disciplined in relation to the Jika Jika escape, a week-long strike occurred.

=== 1987 Jika Jika prison fire ===
In 1987, inmates Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris from one side of the unit, and convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates on the other side, sealed off their section doors with a tennis net. Mattresses and other bedding were then stacked against the doors and set on fire. Wright, Loughnan, Gallagher, McGauley and Morris died in the blaze. Minogue and the three others were evacuated and survived.

== Prison works ==

In 1851, an ad hoc group of structures built by prison labour using local materials existed. None of these structures survived, other than the boundaries of the prison that were established. The second phase of construction, undertaken in the late 1850s and early 1860s, was the construction of Inspector General William Champ&#x27;s model prison complex, based on British and American precedents.
In 1924, Pentridge replaced the Melbourne Gaol as the main remand and reception prison for the metropolitan area. In 1929, Melbourne Gaol was closed and its prisoners relocated to Pentridge. The Victorian Government confirmed its intention to close Pentridge and replace it with two new male prisons, each accommodating around 600 prisoners, in December 1993. In April 1995, the Office of Corrections ordered that the six main towers at Pentridge be closed, since most of the high-security prisoners from the gaol had been relocated to Barwon as part of the downgrading of Pentridge to a medium-security prison. The prison was finally closed in 1997 and sold by the State Government of Victoria.

Since the site was closed, almost all of the buildings identified as being of no significance in the 1996 Pentridge Conservation Management Plan (1996 CMP) prepared by Allom Lovell &amp; Associates have been demolished with the approval of Heritage Victoria. The remaining heritage buildings and landmarks of significance, including A, B, D, E and H Divisions, B Annexe, Pentridge&#x27;s iconic entrance, the administration building, the warden&#x27;s quarters, the rock-breaking yards, the guard towers/posts (or observation posts) and the wall surrounding the site have been retained and will undergo restoration works to ensure their stability and preservation into the future. The site as a whole is also classified as a place of state significance by the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) (National Trust). The National Trust has adopted the levels of significance identified in the 1996 CMP.

== Future of the site ==

A number of the heritage buildings are protected in the Victorian Heritage Register and will be retained and integrated into a new community precinct a mix of housing types, retail, public open space and open piazza as set out in the Pentridge Coburg Design Guidelines and Masterplan of February 2014 (Pentridge Coburg Masterplan).

This document forms part of the Moreland Planning Scheme and was approved by The Hon. Matthew Guy, the Victorian Minister for Planning, between December 2010 and December 2014. A similar Masterplan exists for the Pentridge Village site (Pentridge Village Masterplan). The National Trust has expressed strong concerns about the nature of these masterplans, which involves building high-density high-rise between the historic divisions.

In 2016, Shayher Group revealed plans for a new &quot;urban village&quot; including up to 20 new buildings with community spaces and landscaped gardens as set out in the Pentridge Coburg Masterplan. Work has been undertaken to restore the roof of A Division, and seven guard towers. The H Division&#x27;s rock-breaking yards were demolished.

== Grave sites ==
The grave site of bushranger Ned Kelly formerly lay within the walls of Pentridge Prison. Ronald Ryan&#x27;s remains have been returned to his family. Kelly was executed by hanging at the Melbourne Gaol in 1880 and his remains moved to Pentridge Prison in 1929, after his skeleton was disturbed in April 1929, by workmen constructing the present Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) building. Peter Norden, former prison chaplain at Pentridge Prison, has campaigned for the site&#x27;s restoration.

As of 2011, most of the bodies have been exhumed by archaeologists and have either been re-interred in the original cemetery near D Division, are awaiting identification at the Melbourne morgue, or have been returned to their families.

In 2011, Ned Kelly&#x27;s remains were again exhumed, and returned to his surviving descendants for a family burial. The identified remains of Kelly did not include most of his skull. DNA testing established that another complete skull believed to be Kelly&#x27;s was not his.

==Executions==

===Last execution===
Ronald Ryan, the last man executed at Pentridge Prison, was also the last man to be executed in Australia.

He was hanged in D Division at 8:00 am on 3 February 1967 after being convicted of shooting dead prison officer George Hodson during an escape from the prison. Later that day, Ryan&#x27;s body was buried in an unmarked grave within the D Division prison facility.

<doc id="1183291" wikidata="Q3818322" url="?curid=1183291" title="Alias Grace">
<text>Alias Grace is a historical fiction novel by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood. First published in 1996 by McClelland &amp; Stewart, it won the Giller Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

The story fictionalizes the notorious 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery in Canada West. Two servants of the Kinnear household, Grace Marks and James McDermott, were convicted of the crime. McDermott was hanged and Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Although the novel is based on factual events, Atwood constructs a narrative with a fictional doctor, Simon Jordan, who researches the case. While Jordan is ostensibly conducting research into criminal behaviour, he slowly becomes personally involved in the Marks story and seeks to reconcile his perception of the mild-mannered woman he sees with the murder of which she has been convicted.

Atwood first encountered the story of Marks in &quot;Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush&quot; by Susanna Moodie. In 1970, Atwood published &quot;The Journals of Susanna Moodie&quot;, a cycle of poems informed by the published works of Moodie. It became a classic of Canadian literature, as it lyrically evokes the experience of life in the wilderness, immigrant life, and colonial times. Subsequently, Atwood wrote the 1974 CBC Television film &quot;The Servant Girl&quot; about Marks, also based on Susanna Moodie&#x27;s account. However, in &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, Atwood says that she has changed her opinion of Marks, having read more widely and discovered that Moodie had fabricated parts of her third-hand account of the murders.

== Plot summary ==
Grace Marks, the convicted murderess, has been hired out from prison to serve as a domestic servant in the home of the Governor of the penitentiary. A Committee of gentlemen and ladies from the Methodist church, led by the minister, hopes to have her pardoned and released. Grace cannot remember what happened on the day of the murders, and she exhibits symptoms of hysteria, so the minister hires Dr. Simon Jordan, a psychiatrist, to interview her, hoping he will find her to be a hysteric, and not a criminal. An arrangement is made so that Jordan will interview Grace during afternoons in the sewing room in the governor&#x27;s mansion.

Jordan tries to lead Grace into talking about her dreams and her memories, but she evades his suggestions, so he asks her to start at the beginning, and she proceeds to tell him the story of her life. Grace tells of early childhood in Ireland where her father was often drunk and her mother often pregnant and Grace had to take care of the younger children. She tells the doctor details of the filthy crowded conditions in the hold of the ship where her mother sickened and died. In Canada, because her father continued to spend his earnings on alcohol, she and the children nearly starved and with her mother gone, Grace&#x27;s father began abusing her and even at one point attempted to rape her. Jordan listens but is impatient, viewing her early privations and abuse as irrelevant to the case.

As a serving girl, Grace tells the doctor how she met Mary Whitney, then her roommate and only friend. Mary taught Grace how to act the role of a servant, and joked with her about the family&#x27;s upper class airs, when nobody else was listening. Giving motherly advice on how to stay out of trouble with young men, Mary told her &quot;if there is a ring, there had better be a parson&quot; (p. 165). Mary herself became pregnant – presumably by a son of the family – and died from a botched abortion. Grace had helped Mary get home and into bed, but awoke the next morning to find Mary dead. Grace was troubled afterwards by the idea that she should have opened the window during the night when Mary died to let her soul out (p. 178).

Grace continues her story in vivid detail, making an effort to keep the doctor interested. He is aroused by Grace&#x27;s descriptions of James McDermott&#x27;s advances and Thomas Kinnear&#x27;s affair with Nancy Montgomery. The doctor&#x27;s landlady, whose drunken husband had by then left her, throws herself at him. He is not attracted to her and turns her away several times. He gives her money so she can keep the house thinking she will stop bothering him, but that only provokes her to try harder until she finally seduces him once, only for him to tell her that he wished it to be with someone else and never with her.

A spiritualist on the committee has long since proposed that a Dr. DuPont, &quot;Neuro-Hypnotist&quot;, should put Grace in a trance and arouse her unconscious memory. Jordan, now mostly concerned with escaping the designs of his landlady, can no longer dissuade the committee. It appears to all present that after DuPont puts Grace to sleep, the voice of Mary Whitney takes over, gleefully telling everyone she haunted Grace because her soul was not freed when she died. She said she possessed Grace&#x27;s body on the day of the murders, and drove McDermott to help her kill Montgomery and Kinnear. She says Grace does not remember because she did not know what happened. Jordan allows that there have been some scientific reports of a &quot;double personality&quot; phenomenon, but he evades the committee&#x27;s request for his report and leaves town, claiming his mother is ill. He promises to send them the report, but returning home, he promptly joins the Union Army. After he is wounded in the war, he moves into his mother&#x27;s house. The last word he says is &quot;Grace&quot;. Grace eventually is pardoned, and according to the novel she changes her name and begins a new life in the United States.

== Main characters ==
* Grace Marks the murderess was in fact a model prisoner and eventually pardoned. In the novel, she maintains a carefully respectful demeanour. She is more intelligent and observant than she lets on. While she very much resents being made a spectacle as the famed murderess, she is grateful for the effort being made to have her pardoned.
* Thomas Kinnear was a wealthy Scottish farmer who was murdered in his home in Richmond Hill, Ontario.
* Nancy Montgomery, Kinnear&#x27;s mistress and housekeeper and the murder victim of James McDermott and Grace.
* James McDermott was convicted of the murder of Kinnear and executed. He was employed as a stableman and handyman at Kinnear&#x27;s. He was reputed to be a rough character, a rebellious Irishman, resentful of the English. In the novel, being told to answer to Kinnear&#x27;s housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery, infuriated McDermott.
* Simon Jordan, M.D., is a fictional character, a well-traveled and educated young physician who intends to make his career in mental health, planning to open a private asylum someday.
* Mary Whitney is a fictional character, a maid, and friend of Grace. Mary believes in herself and in Canada as a place that a hard-working girl can earn her way. She plans to save her wages for a dowry so she can marry a farmer and be mistress of her own home.
* Jeremiah Pontelli is a fictional character. Jeremiah the peddler, alias Geraldo Ponti, magician, alias Dr. Jerome DuPont, &quot;Neuro-Hypnotist&quot;, first met Grace when she was a new housemaid and he was peddling house to house in Toronto. When he called at the Kinnear house, he told her he feared she might be in danger there and told her a glimpse into her future.

== Setting ==
Grace Marks, born in 1826, lived in or near Toronto from age 12 until 16, when the famous murders took place. She had resided in the Kingston Penitentiary in Kingston, Ontario for 15 years in 1859, when the novel begins. Among Toronto and Kingston society, Atwood portrays the highly moralistic, straitlaced language and behaviour of the Victorian era. By contrast, it is evident that Mary Whitney&#x27;s crude comments would have been shocking even among servants of that time.

The study of mental health, called &quot;alienism&quot;, was a new development at the time. It was first taught in European universities, and advocated that inmates be treated as patients rather than prisoners. Although the Victorian era was a time of some scientific progress, many Victorians were very much interested in the paranormal, supernatural and occult, hence the use of mesmerism, hypnotism, or spiritualism were viewed as legitimate methods of inquiry.

Atwood chose Richmond Hill, Ontario as the location of the Kinnear farm within Upper Canada. In September 2009, 13 years after the release of the book, Richmond Hill introduced &quot;Alias Grace Park&quot; named after the book.

== Politics ==
The Rebellion of 1837 had taken place six years before the Kinnear and Montgomery murders in 1843, but it still affected public sentiment. The Rebellion terrorized the upper classes even though the rebels were quickly defeated. Government reforms made soon after the Rebellion reduced corruption and restricted the power of the ruling oligarchies, which also worried the upper classes. The idea that the lower classes could rise above their station by hard work or cleverness (rather than by ancestry and inheritance) was finding acceptance in the United States, so the Canadian aristocracy, basing their identity on their English heritage, felt threatened.

== Style ==
The novel is written in the Southern Ontario Gothic style, highlighting the social ills of the time, while exhibiting the corruption and moral hypocrisy of the upper class. Supernatural phenomena, like the ghost of Mary Whitney, fit the Gothic style, as well as the Victorian spiritualist sensibility, justifying the ghost of Mary Whitney&#x27;s gleefully evil confession. Returning from the dead is a recurring theme in Atwood&#x27;s novels.

The main narrator is Grace, whose thoughts and speech are in the first person, and sometimes blend into one another without quotation marks to indicate what is said out loud and what is not. This creates uncertainty at times, echoing the doctor&#x27;s uncertainty about Grace&#x27;s truthfulness, and the reader&#x27;s uncertainty about her guilt. Dr. Jordan&#x27;s thoughts and actions are told by a focalized third-person narrator, as well as his own point of view, allowing the reader to see the contradictions between his words, sometimes even his thoughts, and his actions, as does the inclusion of his correspondence in the book. Similarly, other people&#x27;s letters and quotations from newspapers, letters, poems, and other textual sources echo the patchwork quilting metaphor in that the author used many sources from various perspectives to piece together the whole story.

The portrayal of Grace Marks through a postmodern narrative has been viewed as a deliberate contrast with her faithful reproduction of the details of Victorian domestic life, or as a deliberate defense against Grace&#x27;s objectification. The idea that a gentleman in Victorian Canada would sit in a sewing room day after day listening to the life story of a female servant (no matter how pretty or well-mannered or notorious she might be) is of course, incongruous. However, as Margaret Atwood herself pointed out, &quot;In a Victorian novel, Grace would say, &quot;Now it all comes back to me&quot;; but as &quot;Alias Grace&quot; is not a Victorian novel, she does not say that, and, if she did, would we—any longer—believe her?&quot;

== Main themes ==
===Women&#x27;s history===

Atwood has often used images of sewing and other domestic arts in her novels, illustrating women&#x27;s creativity, constrained as it was, historically, to domestic objects. Names of quilt patterns are used as titles of the 15 book sections in &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, making parallels between Grace&#x27;s interest in quilts and the meanings of their patterns and Grace&#x27;s storytelling, her creation of a domestic history, in which Dr. Jordan hopes to discern patterns. Grace tells her life story to the doctor as a chronology, but, as she does, she reflects on what she tells him like it was a patchwork of experiences. Each patch is destined to fill a particular place in the quilt, and they must all be created before the quilt can be assembled, much as historical research, and especially research on women in history, requires examination of many disparate sources in order to construct a chronological account.

===Identity===
Modern readers may not be satisfied with the idea that Mary, alias Grace, was the murderer. Others might view the use of the term &quot;alias&quot; in the title as suggesting that in their search for the truth about Grace Marks, both readers and characters may be frustrated by duplicity. Grace resists being completely comprehended by these men of power, scientific or religious. She belongs instead to the marginal communities of immigrants, servants, and mad people, who are always vulnerable, and often lost—as Grace lost her mother, and Mary Whitney (her only friend). The only simple truths for Grace are about things—quilts, sheets, carpets, petticoats, the laundry of her life; she gains confidence from a needle and thread. As Margaret Atwood says, &quot;The true character of the historical Grace Marks remains an enigma.&quot; It may be noted that the publication of this book corresponds in time with the height of psychiatric interest in &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; as a legitimate category of illness. This idea goes back to the late 19th century and is associated with the practice of Mesmerism, which evolved into a technique called clinical hypnosis that was often relied upon as a source of &quot;truth&quot; in patients who were otherwise prone to telling the clinician what the clinician wanted to hear. This technique has been largely discredited by the accumulated evidence that trance causes in its subjects increased certainty of the truth of certain memories, whether or not they are in fact true, and that what we remember is often substantially distorted by our own desires. From a psychiatric perspective, Atwood&#x27;s version of Grace&#x27;s story is entirely consistent with a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder, including the perplexing fact that the clinician can rarely be certain of the actual events &quot;remembered&quot; by the patient.

==Adaptations==

In 2012, Sarah Polley announced that she would be adapting &quot;Alias Grace&quot; into a feature film. This has since evolved into a television miniseries which aired on CBC Television in Canada in October and November 2017, and streams globally on Netflix.

In 2016, Ball State University premiered a stage version written by Jennifer Blackmer. The same adaptation was then produced by Rivendell Theatre Ensemble in Chicago, IL, directed by Karen Kessler.

<text>The Casa de Contratación (, House of Trade) or Casa de la Contratación de las Indias (&quot;House of Trade of the Indies&quot;) was established by the Crown of Castile, in 1503 in the port of Seville (and transferred to Cádiz in 1717) as a crown agency for the Spanish Empire. It functioned until 1790, when it was abolished in a government reorganization.

Before the establishment of the Council of the Indies in 1524, the Casa de Contratación had broad powers over overseas matters, especially financial matters concerning trade and legal disputes arising from it. It also was responsible for the licensing of emigrants, training of pilots, creation of maps and charters, probate of estates of Spaniards dying overseas. Its official name was &quot;La Casa y Audiencia de Indias&quot;.

==Establishment==
Unlike the later East India Companies, chartered companies established by the Dutch, English, and others, the &quot;Casa&quot; collected all colonial taxes and duties, approved all voyages of exploration and trade, maintained secret information on trade routes and new discoveries, licensed captains, and administered commercial law.

In theory, no Spaniard could sail anywhere without the approval of the &quot;Casa&quot;. However, smuggling often took place in different parts of the vast Spanish Empire.

The &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; was created by Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1503, eleven years after Christopher Columbus&#x27;s landfall in the Americas in 1492. Ochoa Alvarez de Isasaga (Ysasaga) was named factor for the Crown by King Ferdinand &quot;the Catholic: and Queen Juana I of Castile in 1509 for the Casa.

The &quot;Casa&quot; was the Spanish counterpart of the Portuguese organization, the &quot;Casa da India&quot;, or House of Índia of Lisbon, established in 1434 and destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Dr. Sancho de Matienzo became the first treasurer, Jimeno de Bribiesca the first &quot;contador&quot;, and Francisco Pinelo the first factor. They soon controlled the economic development of Hispaniola.

==Operation==
A 20 per cent tax, the &quot;quinto real&quot; (royal fifth) was levied by the &quot;Casa&quot; on all precious metals entering Spain.

The other taxes could run as high as 40% to provide naval protection for the trading ships or as low as 10 per cent during financial turmoil to encourage investment and economic growth in the colony. Each ship was required to employ a clerk to keep detailed logs of all goods carried and all transactions.

The &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; produced and managed the &quot;Padrón Real&quot;, the official and secret Spanish map used as a template for the maps carried by every Spanish ship during the 16th century.

It was constantly improved from its first version in 1508, and was the counterpart of the Portuguese map, the &quot;Padrão Real&quot;. The &quot;Casa&quot; also ran a navigation school; new pilots, or navigators, were trained for ocean voyages here.

Spain employed the then standard mercantilist model, governed (at least in theory) by the &quot;Casa&quot; in Seville. Trade with the overseas possessions was handled by a merchants&#x27; guild based in Seville, the &quot;Consulado de mercaderes&quot;, which worked in conjunction with the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot;. Trade was physically controlled in well-regulated trade fleets, the famous &quot;Flota de Indias&quot; and the Manila galleons.

==Reductions==
By the late 17th century, the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; had fallen into bureaucratic gridlock, and the empire as a whole was failing, due primarily to Spain&#x27;s inability to finance both war on the Continent and a global empire.

More often than not, the riches transported from Manila and Acapulco to Spain were officially signed over to Spain&#x27;s creditors before the Manila galleon made port.

In the 18th century, the new Bourbon kings reduced the power of Seville and the &quot;Casa de Contratacion&quot;. In 1717 they moved the &quot;Casa&quot; from Seville to Cádiz, diminishing Seville&#x27;s importance in international trade. Charles III further limited the powers of the &quot;Casa&quot;, and his son, Charles IV, abolished it altogether in 1790.

The Spanish treasure fleets were also officially ended due to the abolition, bringing an end to the prosperous Spanish colonial income.

== Mapmakers ==
The cartographic enterprise at the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; was a huge undertaking, and critical to the success of the voyages of discovery. Without good navigational aids, the ability of Spain to exploit and profit from what it found would have been limited. The &quot;Casa&quot; had a large number of cartographers and navigators (pilots), archivists, record keepers, administrators and others involved in producing and managing the &quot;Padrón Real&quot;.

Explorer Amerigo Vespucci, who made at least two voyages to the New World, was a pilot working at the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; until his death in 1512. A special position was created for Vespucci, the &quot;piloto mayor&quot; (chief of navigation), in 1508; he trained new pilots for ocean voyages.

His nephew, Juan Vespucci, inherited his famous uncle&#x27;s maps, charts, and nautical instruments, and along with Andrés de San Martín was appointed to Amerigo&#x27;s former position as the official Spanish government pilot at Seville.

In 1524, Juan Vespucci was appointed &quot;examinador de pilotos&quot; (Examiner of Pilots), replacing Sebastian Cabot who was then leading an expedition in Brazil.

In the 1530s and 1540s, the principal mapmakers (known as &quot;cosmographers&quot;) in the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; working on the &quot;Padrón Real&quot; included Alonso de Santa Cruz, Sebastian Cabot, and Pedro de Medina. The mapmaker Diego Gutiérrez was appointed as cosmographer in the &quot;Casa&quot; on October 22, 1554, after the death of his father Diego in January 1554; he also worked on the Padrón Real.

In 1562, Gutierrez published the map entitled &quot;Americae ... Descriptio&quot; in Antwerp. It was published in Antwerp instead of Spain because the Spanish engravers did not have the necessary skill to print such a complicated document. Other cosmographers included Alonso de Chaves, Jerónimo de Chaves, and Sancho Gutiérrez (Diego&#x27;s brother).

In the late 16th century, Juan López de Velasco was the first &quot;Cosmógrafo-Cronista Mayor&quot; (Cosmographer-Chronicler Major) of the Council of the Indies in Seville.

He produced a master map and twelve subsidiary maps portraying the worldwide Spanish empire in cartographic form.

Although these maps are not especially accurate or detailed, his work represented the apogee of Spanish mapmaking in that period, and surpassed anything done by the other European powers.

Cartographers in England, the Low Countries, and Germany, however, continued to improve their skills in making maps and in organizing and presenting geographic information, until by the end of the 17th century, even Spanish intellectuals were lamenting that the maps produced by foreigners were superior to those made in Spain.

<text>James Rogers, VC (4 July 1873 – 28 October 1961) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Rogers received his award for his actions at Thaba &#x27;Nchu in Orange Free State on 15 June 1901 while serving in the South African Constabulary during the Second Boer War.

==Early life==
James Rogers was born on 4 July 1873 in Moama, New South Wales, the son of John Rogers, a Welsh-born farmer, and his wife Sarah Louisa, née Johnstone, from Sydney. In 1886 his family moved to Heywood, Victoria, where he worked on his father&#x27;s farm.

==Military service==
Rogers joined a local company of the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1898. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War he enlisted as a private in the 1st Victorian Mounted Infantry Company. He subsequently arrived at Cape Town in South Africa in November 1899, where his contingent was allocated to a composite Australian regiment which served in the Cape Colony and Orange River. In May 1900 he was seconded to the Provincial Mounted Police in Orange River Colony as a corporal. Rogers subsequently remained in South Africa at the conclusion of his period of service, joining the South African Constabulary. He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in the South African Constabulary, South African Forces when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

After returning to Australia in late 1901 Rogers was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 6th Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse, and embarked for South Africa again on 19 May 1902. Following the conclusion of the war his battalion returned to Australia, and he received his Victoria Cross from the acting governor-general, Lord Tennyson, on 18 September 1902 at Government House, Melbourne. He had previously been mentioned in despatches. Rogers then unsuccessfully sought to obtain a commission in the Australian Military Forces and, after buying and selling a property near Yea, Victoria, returned to South Africa where he worked as detective with the Cape Police until February 1904. On 25 April 1907, Rogers married Ethel Maud Seldon at Portland, Victoria and they later had two sons.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Rogers was appointed as a lieutenant with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade Train, Australian Army Service Corps. He was wounded at Anzac Cove on Gallipoli on 4 August 1915, and after recovering in hospital in Egypt later served in the Anzac Provost Corps before being returned to Australia for medical reasons in June 1916. Although his appointment in the Australian Imperial Force was terminated on 31 December 1916, he continued to serve on home duties as a captain until the end of the conflict. He subsequently transferred to the reserves on 1 June 1922.

==Later life==
Rogers later worked as a grazier, running a property in the Mallee district in Victoria, before moving to Kew in Melbourne where he lived for 30 years. While living in Kew he had a series of accidents including a fall in his garden resulting in a broken leg for which he was treated at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. He later sprained his ankle. Rogers was treated at the Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic with physio-therapy on 9 April 1948 for an old wound he sustained to his back.

Following the death of his wife he moved to Roseville in Sydney. He died on 28 October 1961, in Concord Repatriation Hospital, Sydney. He was buried in Springvale Cemetery, Victoria. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

<text>A Tactical Coordinator (Tacco, pronounced &#x27;TACK-oh&#x27;) is the aircrew member responsible for coordinating the activities of the part of the crew responsible for the tactical operation of the aircraft and its systems. The TACCO may, depending on the country, be the Mission Commander of the crew.

Typically, TACCOs run the missions in Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King helicopters, Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopters, Lockheed P-3 Orion and Boeing P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft and Lockheed S-3 Viking aircraft. They are specially trained for antisubmarine warfare tactics, but also participate in other missions in which these aircraft are involved.

TACCOs not only operate anti submarine warfare abilities but may also assist in controlling major operational fields and areas of conflict.

<text>Hopkins Correctional Centre is an Australian medium security protection prison for males, located in Ararat, Victoria, approximately west of Melbourne. The centre is operated by Corrections Victoria, part of the Department of Justice of the Victorian Government. 

The centre accepts prisoners convicted of an indictable offence under Victorian and/or Commonwealth legislation, including a high proportion of sex offenders and protection or special needs prisoners.

==History==

Initially known as HM Ararat Prison, the prison was opened in 1967, replacing the century-old Ballarat Gaol. Built at an initial cost of 1.25 million, an ongoing redevelopment program has included a new external security fence, new kitchen and mess room, major industries complex, new accommodation and program areas, and a new visit centre.

In November 2011, the Minister for Corrections and for Crime Prevention, Andrew McIntosh announced that the name of the centre would change to the Hopkins Correctional Centre in recognition of the major contribution made to its operation by the local community. The opportunity was taken to rename the prison as part of the project to add 350 beds to the complex, which was due to be completed in December 2012. A new transition centre has opened, accommodating 40 beds. The facility was expected to add an additional 150 jobs to the region, adding to the existing 160 full-time staff at the centre. The extension was officially opened on 15 October 2015. The Hopkins River is located in the area surrounding Ararat.

== Notable prisoners ==
* Gerald Ridsdale, former Catholic priest, believed to be Australia&#x27;s most prolific child sex abuser
* Brian Keith Jonesalso known as &quot;Mr Baldy&quot;, originally released on parole July 2005.
* Michael Glennon, convicted child molester, died there on 1 January 2014

<doc id="1183312" wikidata="Q4811550" url="?curid=1183312" title="Astrochicken">
<text>Astrochicken is the name given to a thought experiment expounded by theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson. An Astrochicken is a small, one-kilogram spacecraft, a self-replicating automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a crewed craft could due to its innovative mix of technology.

== Description ==
In his book &quot;Disturbing the Universe&quot; (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, self-replicating automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a crewed craft could. He attributed the general idea to John von Neumann, based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled &quot;The General and Logical Theory of Automata&quot;. Dyson expanded on von Neumann&#x27;s automata theories and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram spacecraft unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, artificial intelligence and modern microelectronics—a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an ion drive engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet&#x27;s vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by bombardier beetles. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

== History ==
The term &quot;astrochicken&quot; does not occur in Dyson&#x27;s earliest essays regarding von Neumann-inspired automata. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in Adelaide, Australia, on the subject of space exploration with biotechnology. An audience member called out &quot;Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken.&quot; and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson&#x27;s Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist Rodney Brooks has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of NASA for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the Mars Pathfinder mission. Physicist and noted author Michio Kaku wrote in his work &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, &quot;Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to &#x27;eat&#x27; ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets&quot;.

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson&#x27;s theories, such as the Dyson sphere and the Dyson tree, have become popular in the scientific and science fiction communities. The more whimsically named &quot;Astrochicken&quot; has not achieved this same level of fame.

<doc id="1183313" wikidata="Q5635185" url="?curid=1183313" title="HM Prison Geelong">
<text>HM Prison Geelong was a maximum security Australia prison located on the corner of Myers Street and Swanston Street in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The prison was built in stages from 1849 to 1864. Its panopticon design is based on Pentonville Prison in England. The prison was officially closed in 1991 and prisoners were moved to the newly built HM Prison Barwon in Lara. The building now functions as a museum for the history of the prison.

==History==
The gaol was built by prisoners who slept on high security barges on Corio Bay during construction. The three-storey central block is cruciform with east and west wings serving as cells, the north wing as an administration block, and the southern wing as a kitchen, hospital and a tailoring workshop. The Australian Army used the prison as a detention barracks during, and for a few years after, World War II.

The government closed the gaol in 1991 and the site now operates as a museum. It is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and daily during public and school holidays. The gaol remains mostly unchanged. A gallows exhibit recreates the 1863 hanging of James Murphy, who battered Constable Daniel O&#x27;Boyle to death at the Warrnambool court house. Cell 47 is of special interest as it contains a mural painted on a wall by a prisoner, titled &quot;Window of Freedom&quot;. In 2021, buildings constructed in the 1970s were removed to restore the site to a more historic look.

===Timeline===
* 1853–1865: Gaol for convicts and prisoners
* 1865–1872: Industrial school for girls (typically those convicted of vagrancy)
* 1877–1940: Hospital gaol
* 1940–1947: Army detention barracks during World War II
* 1947–1958: Hospital gaol
* 1958–1991: Training prison
* 2011–current: Guided tours.

==Notable prisoners==
*Frank McCallum (alias Captain Melville) Australian bushranger
*Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Read
*Angus Murray an associate of gangster Squizzy Taylor who escaped in 1923 only to be executed for his role in a murder in Melbourne shortly after. He was in cell 74 and the hole in the floor that was caused when he dropped a brick upon leaving still remains.

==Executions==
==In media==
The 1994 film &quot;Everynight ... Everynight&quot; was shot at the prison. In 2015, the prison also served as a location for &quot;Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race.&quot;

The prison was opened when William Gardner was appointed Governor on the 1st of July 1887. The Sale prison remained on that site until it closed in April 1997. The site now houses the Sale Police Station, which features some of the old prison walls.

Demolition halted for several months due to a legal battle, but resumed soon after.

<text>A signaller, signalman, colloquially referred to as a radioman or signaleer in the armed forces is a specialist soldier, sailor or airman responsible for military communications. Signallers, a.k.a. Combat Signallers or signalmen or women, are commonly employed as radio or telephone operators, relaying messages for field commanders at the front line (Army units, Ships or Aircraft), through a chain of command which includes field headquarters. Messages are transmitted and received via a communications infrastructure comprising fixed and mobile installations.

==Duties==
In the past, signalling skills have included the use of: Heliograph, Aldis lamp, semaphore flags, &quot;Don R&quot; (Dispatch Riders) and even carrier pigeons.

Modern signallers are responsible for the battlefield voice and data communication and information technology infrastructure or in common English terms, they may carry a backpack radio transceiver used to communicate to forward operating bases (large and small outposts for the military), using a variety of media. All types of wire (line), satellite and ionospheric radio communication are employed. These include common radio systems such as HF/VHF radio and UHF/SHF radio (operated in line of sight, for example). Cellular radio and telephone systems such as TETRA are also becoming common.

In addition to day-to-day soldiering, the signaller is required to be competent at a number of skill levels in the following topics:

*Maintaining Power Supplies (Batteries and Charging for example)
*Radio sets; storage and logistics; installation and operation; maintenance and repair at unit level.
*Station Organisation; Managing Radio Nets and Maintaining Net Discipline for example, map marking, log keeping etc.
*Voice and wireless telegraphy procedure (using Morse code or RATT (Radio assisted Teletype) for example). Formal message procedure, electronic mail.
*Electronic Warfare (EW); Communications Security (COMSEC) - including the encryption and deciphering of coded messages using paper/voice and electronic codes for example.
*Telephone and Line
*Information and Communication Technology
*Antennae selection and design

==Air Forces==
In an air force, a signaller, an aircrew member, is a person trained to communicate between the aircraft, its base and units in the area of operation, by means of radio or other digital communications.

==Navy Forces==
In the navy, a signaller is usually a seaman trained to communicate between the fleet forces and naval bases in the area of operation, by means of radio or other digital communications.

==Armies==
===Australia===
In the Australian Army, a signaller is often referred to as a Chook (Australian Slang for Chicken) by soldiers outside the Signal Corps, because the Morse code used by Signallers has been likened to the chirping of chickens.

===Canada===

In the Canadian Army, a signaller is often referred to as a &quot;Jimmy&quot; in reference to the flag and cap badge feature Mercury (Latin: Mercurius), the winged messenger of the Roman gods, who is referred to by members of the corps as &quot;Jimmy&quot;. The origins of this nickname are unclear. According to one explanation, the badge is referred to as &quot;Jimmy&quot; because the image of Mercury was based on the late medieval bronze statue by the Italian sculptor Giambologna, and shortening over time reduced the name Giambologna to &quot;Jimmy&quot;. The most widely accepted theory of where the name Jimmy comes from is a Royal Signals boxer, called Jimmy Emblem, who was the British Army Champion in 1924 and represented the Royal Corps of Signals from 1921 to 1924.

Signallers in Canada are responsible for the majority of radio, satellite, telephone, and computer communications within the Canadian military. 
Trained signallers of the rank of private in Canada are referred to as &quot;Sig&quot; as a replacement for private (i.e. Sig Smith).

===United Kingdom===
In the British Army, signaller may refer to a member of the Royal Corps of Signals specifically to the rank of Signaller (formerly Signalman) or a trained signals specialist in other areas of the army such as the Infantry or Royal Artillery. The rank is equivalent to that of Private.

== Modern age ==

The US and European powers, especially during World War 1 and World War 2, have employed extensive use of field telephones and other methods of transmitting messages like carrier pigeons, runners were essentially army messengers and couriers that ran from place to place, culminating in the extensive World War 2, Korea and Vietnam use of the backpack transceiver, eventually becoming unit-based radio and unit-to-HQ based field &quot;telephone&quot;.

Specially designated soldiers in a unit would and still do, have a single soldier with a backpack transceiver and large telescoping antennae that can be as tall as 10 meters or 20 feet.

It is also called RTO, which stands for &quot;Radio Telephone Operator&quot;. At the field, soldiers usually call them RTO, rather than Signaller. They are soldiers specializing in military communications in the military, mainly operating wired/wireless communication equipment or sending telegrams to commanders from the front line according to the command line, including field headquarters and control agencies.

<doc id="1183319" wikidata="Q951075" url="?curid=1183319" title="Jerry Litton">
<text>Jerry Lon Litton (May 12, 1937 – August 3, 1976) was an American politician from Missouri who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing Missouri&#x27;s 6th congressional district from 1973 until his death in 1976. A member of the Democratic Party, he ran for United States Senate in 1976. Litton won the Democratic primary; however, he died in a plane crash while heading to his victory party.

==Early life==
Litton was born near Lock Springs, Daviess County, Missouri, in a house without electricity. He was national secretary of the Future Farmers of America (1956–1957), and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1961 with a B.S. in Journalism. He was president of the University of Missouri Young Democrats and chair of the National Youth for Stuart Symington during Symington&#x27;s unsuccessful 1960 run for U.S. President. Litton served as President of the Theta chapter of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.

He made his fortune raising cattle at the Litton Charolais Cattle Ranch in Chillicothe, Missouri. This ranch was maintained as a beautiful showplace where he entertained both the well-connected and constituents. Litton made a point to bring schoolchildren and low-level local leaders to his home. Before he began his political career, he was active in promoting youth involvement in leadership in agriculture and rural communities. His family (including his parents, Mildred and Charley Litton) was very prominent in the Charolais cattle business.

==U.S. Representative==
Litton was elected to the U.S. House as a Democrat in 1972. He was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, and his television show &quot;Dialogue with Litton&quot; was broadcast statewide. Among the guests were Jimmy Carter, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz, Congressman Tip O&#x27;Neill, and House Speaker Carl Albert.

Green bumper stickers (like those used in his prior Congressional campaigns) circulated in the state, saying &quot;Litton for President&quot;. Jimmy Carter said that he thought Litton would be president one day.

==1976 U.S. Senate election==

In 1976, after only two terms in the House of Representatives, Litton entered into what amounted to a three-way Democratic Party primary race for the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Senator Stuart Symington. The other major contestants were Symington&#x27;s son James W. Symington and former Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes. Final election results showed Congressman Litton winning with 45.39%, former Governor Warren Hearnes second at 26.38%, and Congressman James Symington finishing third with 25.16% of the statewide vote. Seven other candidates, including Kansas City, Missouri Mayor Charles Wheeler, split the remaining 4 percent of the vote.

==Death==
Litton won the primary but died on August 3, 1976, along with his entire family (wife Sharon and their two children, Linda and Scott), pilot Paul Rupp Jr., and the pilot&#x27;s son, Paul Rupp III, as they departed the airport for a victory party in Kansas City. Their plane, a Beechcraft Model 58 Baron, crashed on take-off from the Chillicothe airport shortly after 9 p.m. on election night. The investigation into the crash determined the twin-engine plane broke a crankshaft in the left engine. The plane was about above the airport&#x27;s only hard-surfaced runway when the engine failed. The plane veered to the left and crashed rapidly into a soybean field, where it exploded on impact, burning all victims beyond recognition. The NTSB reported that the pilot did not retract the wheels when the engine cut off and that this contributed to the sudden loss of control. The report said the plane had been airborne for only 19 seconds before striking the ground. The plane was owned by Rupp Automotive, which was the car parts store owned by Rupp.

The State Democratic Committee held a vote on a new nominee on August 21, and Hearnes defeated Missouri State Treasurer Jim Spainhower, garnering 63.3% of the vote. Hearnes lost the general election to Missouri Attorney General John Danforth, who garnered 56.93% of the vote.

A museum of Litton memorabilia was opened in the Jerry L. Litton Visitor Center near the dam at Smithville Lake in Smithville, Missouri.

<doc id="1183322" wikidata="Q2905448" url="?curid=1183322" title="Loadmaster">
<text>A loadmaster is an aircrew member on military transport aircraft or civilian aircraft (with cargo ramp) tasked with the safe loading, transport and unloading of aerial cargoes. Loadmasters serve in the militaries and civilian airlines of many nations.

==Duties==
 
The Loadmaster role involves complex mathematical and engineering calculations to ensure aircraft balance and safety throughout a flight. Loadmasters utilize physics, moments, engineering formulas, charts, graphs, and heavily applied basic algebra and trigonometry mathematics to determine the proper placement of cargo and passengers, ensuring the aircraft remains within permissible center of gravity limits. These skilled and certified weight and balance planners act as aviation engineering technicians (devoid of this title), with many holding an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Aviation Operations, which provides the foundational knowledge necessary for this technical job. While not all loadmasters officially obtain their AAS degree, every qualified loadmaster who earns their wings and completes Loadmaster School is awarded 45 accredited Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) credits toward the AAS. To complete the degree, loadmasters only need to take five elective classes at either the CCAF or any accredited university or community college.

Beyond basic planning, loadmasters must ensure that cargo is placed in such a way as to prevent overloading sensitive sections of the airframe and cargo floor. Unusual cargo may require special equipment to be loaded safely aboard the aircraft, which can limit the feasible placement of other cargo. Tactically, loadmasters play a critical role in combat readiness as they are responsible for determining the load order of aircraft so that more tactically important material (e.g., ammunition) is off-loaded first and therefore ready to deploy faster than other support items. This is especially crucial at forward operating bases.

While the loadmaster may physically load the aircraft, their primary responsibility is to supervise loading crews and procedures. Once positioned aboard the aircraft, the loadmaster ensures that cargo is properly secured, as an unexpected shift of the load can cause serious handling problems for the aircraft. Chains, straps, and integrated cargo locks are among the most common tools used to secure cargo. Because cargo may shift during abrupt maneuvers, the loadmaster must determine the appropriate types, quantity, and placement of cargo restraints to prevent such occurrences.

Many loadmasters are also required to be qualified for &quot;aerial delivery&quot; of paratroops or cargo by parachute. Compared to the relatively routine transportation of cargo, airdrops are a highly technical and potentially dangerous undertaking. In some situations, the most effective way to resupply ground troops is by aerial delivery of equipment, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Many military victories have been dependent in large part upon these aerial deliveries.

Cargo helicopter loadmasters also provide aircraft clearance information and direct pilots to safe positions when landing and taking off.

==History==
===Development, early 1940s, and WWII===
Although the aircraft loadmaster career field was not formally established by the US Air Force until 1953, duties eventually assumed by loadmasters began early in World War II when laundry personnel assigned to Air Corps quartermaster units began flying on troop carrier transports in the Australia and New Guinea, later in the China-Burma-India area of operations, to eject cargo bundles they have previously prepared for airdrop from the doors over drop zones. By 1944 the IX Troop Carrier Command in Europe included personnel designated as &quot;dropmasters&quot; in its troop carrier squadrons. Also in 1944 the Air Transport Command began assigning enlisted men, most of whom had been in training for aircrew duty in other fields, including pilots, navigators and bombardiers, as &quot;flight clerks.&quot; The first flight clerks were assigned to special flights known as &quot;Red Ball&quot; which were set up to deliver crucial aircraft parts to ATC units in India assigned to the India-China Ferry. By the end of the war, flight clerks were flying on most four-engine transports to be responsible for cargo manifests and take care of passengers. Weight and balance computation does not appear to have initially been one of their duties, although it has been associated with the loadmaster career field since it was established. They were given the MOS 2967 - Flight Traffic Clerk. The new MOS was obviously an outgrowth of the 967 MOS, which had been given to men assigned to air cargo units as air traffic specialists.

During World War II, aircraft were initially loaded haphazardly, with ground personnel piling as much cargo into an airplane as possible, which often led to weight and balance problems. To alleviate the situation, air terminal squadrons were set up by the troop carrier wings overseas and, after the establishment of the Air Transport Command, at air terminals in the United States. Officers, pilots and navigators, were trained to perform weight and balance calculations and became responsible for load planning. Aerial engineers on bombers and four-engine transports were also trained in weight and balance calculations using special slide rules developed for each airplane and commonly known as &quot;slipsticks&quot;.

===Late 1940s, Korean War, and the 1950s===
The term &quot;loadmaster&quot; is believed to have been created by the Douglas Aircraft Company, because the first known use of the term appears in the flight manuals for the C-124 Globemaster II aircraft in the late 1940s, the largest piston-engine transport aircraft in the US inventory at the time.

A fixed-wing aircraft is supported in flight only by its wing(s). For an aircraft to become and remain airborne, the wing must move through the air at a specified &quot;angle of attack&quot;. To assure that the wing moves through the air at the proper angle of attack, the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity must fall within a range specified by the aircraft&#x27;s designers. An aircraft that is too nose-heavy or too tail-heavy will not fly properly, because the angle of attack is affected adversely. This can destroy lift, and cause a stall in certain maneuvers.

The center of gravity of a transport aircraft is a function of a number of factors: the weight of the empty aircraft (the so-called &quot;basic weight&quot;), the weight of the fuel load (usually carried only in the wings), the weight of the cargo and passengers, and the weight of the crew, and the positions of each of these factors. The weight of each of these factors is known before a flight. What varies from flight to flight is not only the weight of any or all of these factors, but the position of such factors as fuel, passengers and cargo. The weight of each of these factors is converted into a moment by multiplying the weight of each item times its distance from a reference point which was established when the aircraft was designed. The sum of all moments is then divided by the sum of all weights and the result is the &quot;center of gravity&quot; for the aircraft with crew, fuel, cargo and passengers aboard. This center of gravity must be within a range specified by the designers. Furthermore, as fuel is burned off during flight the center of gravity changes continually, so that the aircraft becomes either more nose-heavy or more tail-heavy as the flight continues. This must be taken into account when the aircraft is loaded. An aircraft which was &quot;within limits&quot; on takeoff could, in the course of a flight, become &quot;out of limits&quot; because of fuel burnoff.

Throughout the 1950s, loadmasters in troop carrier units were assigned primarily to aerial port squadrons. In the Military Air Transport Service, they were assigned to air transport squadrons and flew on missions when cargo was carried. MATS loadmasters were considered cabin crewmembers rather than part of the flight crew and were not afforded crew rest as were members of the cockpit crew.

===1960s, the Vietnam War, and 1970s===
In the early 1960s with the advent of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the increasing role of troop carrier transports in Southeast Asia, loadmasters were reassigned from aerial port units to troop carrier squadrons where they assumed duties previously assigned to scanners and became part of the flight crew. Loadmasters became extremely important in the harsh conditions of Southeast Asia, where troop carrier aircraft operated into forward airfields that were often under fire, especially after the Tet Offensive of 1968 when soldiers and Marines began calling C-123s and C-130s &quot;mortar magnets.&quot; The loadmaster&#x27;s task was to discharge the load as quickly as possible so the airplane could get off the ground to avoid incoming rocket and mortar fire. Loadmasters were also trained to drop flares and leaflets, and to operate retrieval equipment used in special operations aircraft.

In 1964, MATS became the Military Airlift Command (MAC) and assumed more of an operational role. Loadmasters, often first-term airmen, continued the previous role, but were also trained for tactical operations, particularly aerial delivery of troops and cargo from C-141s. When the gigantic C-5A entered service, the loadmaster field became more technical as loadmasters became responsible for operating complex systems to operate the hydraulic systems that operated the forward and aft cargo doors and to kneel the airplane for loading and unloading.

The Vietnam War also led to the assignment of loadmasters to Airlift Control Elements, commonly known as ALCE (aka TALCE when deployed), where they were responsible for planning loads at forward locations with Army and Marine Corps units.

===1980s and after===

Until the 1980s, loadmasters were found primarily within the military, but as civilian airlines became more involved in air freight operations with large airplanes, particularly, the Boeing 747, many companies began using loadmasters on flights where complex cargo loads were carried.

==Loadmasters decorated for valor==
Airman First Class John Levitow became the only loadmaster to be decorated with the Medal of Honor after his AC-47 gunship was struck by a Viet Cong mortar near Bien Hoa in 1968. Badly wounded, Levitow managed to throw an armed flare out of the airplane before it ignited the airplane&#x27;s ammunition stores.

Staff Sergeant Charles Schaub was awarded the Air Force Cross for his actions when his C-130 was struck by ground fire during an airdrop mission over An Loc in 1972.

Staff Sergeant Maynard Grubbs was awarded the Silver Star for his role as the loadmaster on the C-123 crew commanded by Lt. Col. Joe M. Jackson, who landed his C-123 at Khe Sanh to pick up members of an Air Force airlift control team that had been stranded at the besieged camp at Kham Duc. (Lt. Col. Jackson was awarded the Medal of Honor for the action.)

Several other loadmasters received Silver Stars for actions in Blind Bat C-130 flareships and Staff Sergeant Ralph Bemis received the medal after the C-130 he was on was shot down over An Loc.

Sergeant Daniel Baxter (RAF) was a Chinook loadmaster and a crew member of the standby Chinook at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. He was mentioned in dispatches for actions on 6 September 2006 that he acted with exceptional professionalism and bravery under enemy fire three times.

Sergeant Graham Jones, 32, a Chinook crewman, has been honoured for going beyond his duties by leaving the aircraft in order to fire at the enemy in the heartland of the Taliban so that a quadbike rider could make his getaway on the ground.

<doc id="1183326" wikidata="Q4970935" url="?curid=1183326" title="British Rail Metro-Cammell Lightweight">
<text>In 1955, Metropolitan Cammell produced its first lightweight diesel multiple units, the prototypes of what were to become British Rail&#x27;s most successful and longest-lived &quot;First Generation&quot; DMU type, the Class 101.

== Operations ==
The seven London Midland Region sets (formed DMBS + DTCL) were used on the Bury-Bacup line services, while the other sets (formed DMBS + DTSL) were all allocated to the Eastern Region. These sets were used on a variety of lines in East Anglia as well as the (then) non-electrified lines in Essex (Romford-Upminster and Wickford-Southminster branches).

A unit consisting of 79066 and 79282 worked the last passenger service on the Aldeburgh Branch Line in 1966.

==Withdrawal==
They proved to be very successful, but with line closures continuing through the 1960s, including many in East Anglia where the type was first used, their non-standard coupling arrangements left them prone to early withdrawal, which took place during 1967–1969.

==Departmental use==
All were scrapped following withdrawal, except two (79047 + 79053), which were taken into departmental (non-revenue earning) service as 975018 + 975019. They were used at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby as &quot;Laboratory 21: Plasma Torch Research&quot;. When this extended life was complete, they too were scrapped, in 1981.

<doc id="1183339" wikidata="Q7412373" url="?curid=1183339" title="Samuel Pearse">
<text>Samuel George Pearse, VC, MM (16 July 1897 – 29 August 1919) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Serving in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, he saw action during the final weeks of the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 and later on the Western Front from 1916 to 1918. Following the Armistice he fought as part of the North Russia Relief Force with the British Army during the North Russia Campaign in 1919. He was killed after charging a machine gun post during an action at Emtsa, in North Russia, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Samuel George Pearse was born on 16 July 1897 at Penarth, Glamorganshire, Wales, to George Stapleton Pearse and his wife Sarah Ann, née Sellick. Initially educated at Penarth Boarding School, he moved to Australia with his family in 1911, with his father acquiring a property near at Koorlong, near Mildura, Victoria. Pearse later worked as a fruit-picker, labourer, trapper, and as a deck-hand on a paddle-steamer.

==Military service==
Pearse served in the Militia for two years with the 73rd Infantry Regiment, before volunteering for overseas service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War. At the time of his enlistment in the AIF in July 1915 just before he turned eighteen, Pearse&#x27;s occupation was as a rabbit-trapper. He sailed from Melbourne on 10 September 1915 aboard the &quot;Star of Victoria&quot;, assigned to the 9th Reinforcement for the 7th Battalion reaching Gallipoli shortly before the evacuation and spending two weeks in the line there in December 1915.

After transferring to the 2nd Machine Gun Company, assigned to support the 2nd Brigade, Pearse subsequently saw action on the Western Front where he was wounded on 24 August 1916 but soon returned to his unit. On 28 September 1917 he was awarded the Military Medal for an action in single-handedly raiding a German machine gun-post east of Ypres in Belgium:

Challinger records that Pearse was awarded his Military Medal in the field by General Sir William Birdwood but that at the time Birdwood had run out of medals and decorated Pearse with a strip of medal ribbon. Challinger also references Pearse&#x27;s army record which quite apart from his awards for valour includes entries for neglect of duty, absence from guard and disobedience to orders. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 November 1917, and to corporal on 10 April 1918. He was wounded in action for a second time on 19 May 1918. He subsequently returned to England to recover, but did not return to his unit until the end of the war. After undergoing training at the Machine Gun Depot, he was posted the 1st Machine Gun Battalion on 1 December 1918.

Following the Armistice, Pearse was attracted by the prospect of a tour of duty with the North Russia Relief Force and like the other 150 Australian soldiers who volunteered, Pearse was discharged from the AIF on 18 July 1919 and re-enlisted in the British Army as a private soldier. Many of the volunteering Australians had come late to action in First World War but Pearse was a battle-hardened veteran and was soon promoted to sergeant. He was a 22-year-old sergeant in the 45th Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers during the North Russia Campaign under the command of Brigadier General Lionel Sadleir-Jackson when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:


==Burial and medals==
Samuel Pearse was buried in a military graveyard near the Obozerskaya railway station, between Emtsa and Archangel, North Russia. A photo taken in September 1919 shows his grave to be intact, but all visible traces of the graveyard eventually disappeared and the location forgotten. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission records him being buried in the Obozerskaya Burial Ground and then commemorated at the Archangel Allied Cemetery. The Allied War Cemetery in Archangel has plaques on its walls listing the names of all those buried elsewhere. His Victoria Cross, Military Medal and 1914–15 Star are on display under his photo in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra. Two other service medals were issued but their whereabouts is unknown.

In 2018, a small team of Russian volunteers found a grave believed to be that of Sgt. Pearse after part-time searching for more than ten years. Guided by a 1925 map and 1919 aerial photograph, the remains were exhumed and are currently being stored at the Archangel Morgue. As of 2019, formal DNA identification of the remains has not yet been undertaken but the skeleton is the same height as Sgt. Pearse (5&#x27;6&quot;); the remains of a slouch hat were found in the grave; the grave was precisely as shown on the 1925 map; a toe was missing from the right foot, as mentioned in Pearse&#x27;s Australian army records; and the whitewashed stones found during the exhumation appeared to be those shown in the 1919 photograph.

On 29 August 2019, a brief ceremony with nine people in attendance took place at the remains of the bunker where Pearse died, unofficially commemorating the 100th anniversary. Those in attendance included seven Russians – three members of the search team, a priest, a female interpreter, a female reporter and her cameraman – and two Australians, Damien Wright, historian and author (Churchill&#x27;s Secret War With Lenin, 2017), and Richard Christen, grandson of Pearse.

==Family life==
While on leave in England in January 1918 Pearse met Kitty Knox, an ambulance driver serving in the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps. They were engaged in May 1918 and that same month spent time together while Pearse was convalescing after suffering a foot wound. They were married on 1 June 1919 in Durham and when Kitty became pregnant they had decided to delay returning to Australia. The couple had a daughter, Victoria Catherine Sarah Pearse, born in February 1920, after his death. Kitty and Victoria later emigrated in May 1920 to Australia and Kitty married Albert Rose.

<doc id="1183350" wikidata="Q4800390" url="?curid=1183350" title="Arthur Sullivan (Australian soldier)">
<text>Arthur Percy Sullivan VC (27 November 1896 – 9 April 1937) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British Armed Forces. Born in South Australia, Sullivan worked for the National Bank of Australasia prior to enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in April 1918 for service in World War I. He had arrived in the United Kingdom, but had not completed training when the Armistice came into effect on 11 November. Sullivan was promoted to corporal in March 1919, but wanting to see active service he sought and received his discharge from the AIF on 28 May. On the same day, he enlisted in the British Army for service with the North Russia Relief Force, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.

Sullivan was deployed to northern Russia with the relief force. Following a successful attack, he was a member of the rearguard of a column withdrawing across the Sheika River. As his platoon crossed the river on a crude one-plank bridge in the early hours of 11 August 1919, it came under intense fire from Bolshevik troops, and four members fell into the river. Sullivan immediately jumped in and rescued them all, one by one, and was awarded the VC for his actions. Demobilised from the British Army after completing his service, Sullivan returned to Australia and resumed his civilian career as a banker. He was in London for the coronation of King George VI as part of the Australian Coronation Contingent in 1937, when he died of head injuries received in a fall. His medal set is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Early life==
Arthur Percy Sullivan was born on 27 November 1896 at Prospect, South Australia, the only child of Arthur Monks Sullivan, a storekeeper, and his wife Eliza Dobbs of Crystal Brook in the mid-north of the state. Beginning on 9 February 1904, he was educated at Crystal Brook Public School and from 1910 at Gladstone High School where he was the school captain. Sullivan was also editor of the school magazine and the best Australian rules football player for his school.

After completing his education in mid-1913, he gained employment at a branch of the National Bank of Australasia in Gladstone on 25 September. After six months&#x27; probation, he was taken on as a clerk on 8 April 1914. Only 17 at the outbreak of World War I, Sullivan wanted to enlist, but his parents would not give the necessary permission. On 25 May 1915, he was promoted and transferred to a branch at Broken Hill, New South Wales, just over the northeastern border of South Australia, where he was promoted to ledger keeper. The following year he returned to his home state to work at a branch in Maitland commencing on 30 October, where he was promoted to teller. Sullivan played golf and Australian rules football, and was the secretary of the Maitland Patriotic Society, which organised farewells and welcome home events for local men who had enlisted or returned from the war. He turned 20 soon after his arrival in Maitland, and his parents permitted him to enlist, although he did not do so immediately.

==Military service==
===World War I===
On 27 April 1918, Sullivan attended a fund-raising parade in Port Pirie for the Returned Soldiers&#x27; Appeal. After the parade, the attendees congregated at the town recreation grounds, where a sports carnival was held, and volunteers for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) were encouraged to come forward. Sullivan enlisted that day as a private in the AIF and was allocated as a general reinforcement. He underwent training at Mitcham Camp in Adelaide between 14 May and 4 June, and was then farewelled in Maitland at an event similar to those he had organised for other recruits before their departure. He embarked with about 700 others on the troopship HMAT A74 &quot;Marathon&quot; in Melbourne on 23 July bound for the United Kingdom. The convoy in which the &quot;Marathon&quot; travelled sailed via Albany, Western Australia, Durban and Cape Town, South Africa, and Freetown, Sierra Leone. Upon arriving in Tilbury in the UK on 27 September, Sullivan was briefly allocated as a reinforcement to the 10th Battalion before transferring to the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery training camp at Heytesbury, Wiltshire, on 5 October 1918. He was still in training when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918, and Sullivan therefore saw no action in World War I.

===Russia===

While posted to the camp at Heytesbury, Sullivan contracted gonorrhea and was hospitalised at Bulford Camp between 25 November 1918 and 11 March 1919. Upon discharge from hospital he was transferred to a training battalion at Codford, and on 23 March he was promoted to acting corporal, and employed as a camp orderly room corporal. He was keen for a tour of active duty with the North Russia Relief Force (NRRF) as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. This intervention had begun after the Bolsheviks had overthrown the Russian government and made peace with the Central Powers in 1917. Allied troops had become involved in the ongoing civil war, and after the Armistice in November 1918, their involvement continued, albeit with poorly defined objectives. In March 1919, the NRRF was conceived to intervene against the Bolsheviks and create a situation where the original force could be withdrawn. Although no Australian contingent was being sent with the NRRF, it was recruiting amongst Australians then in the UK, and a recruiting officer visited Codford in April. Sullivan was attracted by the high pay and potential for adventure. The Australian government limited recruitment to single Australians who were willing to forgo their right to repatriation. Sullivan was discharged from the AIF on 28 May 1919, and enlisted in the British Army on the same day as a corporal.

The NRRF was an 8,000-strong force of two brigades that included about 150 Australians who had been awaiting repatriation from the UK. Sullivan was allotted to the 45th Battalion, the Royal Fusiliers (45th RF), part of the NRRF brigade commanded by Brigadier General Lionel Sadleir-Jackson. The Australians were permitted to continue wearing the Australian uniform, and wore the NRRF colour patch on their sleeve. The commanding officer of the 45th RF was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Davies, an Australian who had commanded the 32nd Battalion on the Western Front. Sullivan and the other Australians went into camp at Sandling in Kent where they prepared for their deployment. The Australians who volunteered for the NRRF were concentrated in two units: the 45th RF, and the 201st Company, Machine Gun Corps. 
Sullivan sailed directly from Leith to Russia with an advance party on board the cargo ship &quot;Steigerwald&quot; on 9 June, and, travelling via Murmansk, landed at Archangel on 20 June. A 50-man detachment of the advance party was almost immediately sent up the Dvina River by paddle steamer to the village of Pinega, where they stayed for five days, ostensibly to quell rioting, although they actually encountered no trouble. They returned downstream to the village of Osinovo where they were reunited with the rest of the advance party. Osinovo was about behind the frontline at the village of Seltso, and the camp contained about 4,000 troops. At Osinovo, they went into camp with the rest of the advance force, and underwent intensive training. On the river was a flotilla of British monitors and gunboats. The main body of the NRRF arrived in Archangel on 11 July, following two mutinies by British-led White Russian battalions in the area. The Bolsheviks held a fortified line about south of Osinovo.

===Dvina offensive===
In August the NRRF was ordered to advance down the Dvina River to attack the Bolsheviks. About 4,000 men of the NRRF, supported by the river flotilla, artillery and aircraft, were set against about 6,000 Bolshevik troops of the 3rd Brigade of the 18th Division, also supported by artillery. D Company of the 45th RF, which included Sullivan and about 20 other Australians, was to push down the western side of the Dvina and take the villages of Sludka and Lipovets from the rear. Other columns were to attack other villages on the river. The D Company column included machine gun sections, mortars, mountain guns and some cavalry. They were ferried across the river to the village of Yakovlevskoye and set off on the afternoon of 7 August. They then undertook a wide-sweeping approach march of nearly through a thick forest to be in position for the attack at 12:00 on 10 August. The aims of the overall offensive were three-fold: to lower Bolshevik morale; to push back the Bolshevik river flotilla so that mines could be laid to impede any follow-up of the imminent British withdrawal; and to improve the morale of the anti-Bolshevik forces.

Sludka was the column&#x27;s first objective, but on 9 August, scouts reported that the location of a swamp made a direct attack on the village impossible. As a result, the column pushed further south to attack the village of Kochamika, after which they would turn north and capture Sludka. The approach march began at 06:00 on 10 August, and the men slogged through the mud to positions at the edge of the forest by 11:00. Thirty minutes later, the British artillery, the river flotilla and aircraft began bombarding Kochamika. At 12:00, the D Company column, which included Sullivan&#x27;s 16 Platoon, launched its assault, although without the support of the mountain guns and cavalry that had been left behind owing to the difficult terrain. With bayonets fixed, the force easily put the stunned Bolshevik defenders to flight. As soon as the village was taken, they came under fire from the Bolshevik river flotilla.

D Company then pushed northwards, capturing several hamlets and many Bolshevik prisoners, although D Company&#x27;s commander was killed by river gunboat fire. After scouting out Sludka, a successful assault was mounted on that village as well, while another column led by A Company captured Lipovets. The D Company column then joined A Company at Lipovets aiming to then reunite with the rest of the force, which had been unsuccessfully attacking the village of Seltso from the north. The Bolsheviks landed around 100 sailors between the two Allied columns, cutting off the southerly column including A and D Companies. Without their commander and running low on ammunition, the remaining officers decided to try to break out rather than push on towards Seltso. Impeded by their own wounded, over 500 prisoners-of-war, and local townspeople forced to accompany the column to stop them informing the Bolsheviks, the column made slow progress. Sullivan&#x27;s 16 Platoon was designated as the rearguard.

About 02:30 on 11 August, having covered in eight hours, the column crossed the Sheika River, which at this point resembled a deep swamp about wide. The crossing was over a crude single-plank bridge. Sullivan&#x27;s platoon was holding the near bank. As the long column crossed in single file, it was hit by Bolshevik rifle and machine gun fire at a range of less than . The fire from the ambush increased as the rearguard crossed, and four men fell into the swamp and were in danger of drowning owing to exhaustion. Despite the intense Bolshevik gunfire and already nearly across the river himself, Sullivan immediately set about rescuing them. The first man that Sullivan saved from the swamp was Lieutenant Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, Lord Settrington, who had been wounded prior to falling off the bridge. He was the eldest son of the 8th Duke of Richmond and heir to the dukedoms of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon. He died of his wounds two weeks later in hospital at Bereznik. The second and third soldiers rescued were similarly pulled out of the swamp by Sullivan after either being hit or avoiding enemy fire. The fourth man was some distance away and Sullivan waded out with a piece of broken handrail from the temporary bridge that the soldier was able to grab and be pulled to safety. All four would have drowned without Sullivan&#x27;s action. The fusiliers returned fire from the far bank, and suppressed the Bolshevik fire. After the river crossing, some members of the column broke off into smaller groups, but all remaining members made their way back to the British lines at Troitsa about 07:00. Total British casualties during the overall attack were less than 30 killed with over 100 wounded.

For his actions on 11 August, Sullivan was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British armed forces. Two other Australians were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), second only to the VC, for their actions at the river crossing.

British forces successfully evacuated from North Russia by late September, leaving Troitsa by 10 September, and sailing from Archangel on 27 September, with Sullivan having spent 100 days in Russia. On 26 September, Sullivan&#x27;s VC was formally announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. The citation read:
When told of his award, Sullivan said that his comrades were also worthy of recognition and stated that his VC should be raffled, although the latter did not occur.

===Return to Australia===
The Australians arrived in Plymouth on 9 October, and were then sent to a repatriation camp near Winchester. After a rowdy night out on leave following their arrival, a British sergeant tried to get the names of all the miscreants in his notebook. When questioned about his name, Sullivan replied, &quot;Corporal Sullivan VC to you, you pommie bastard&quot;. Despite the insubordination, no action was taken against him. Sullivan gave only one interview about his VC exploits, and was modest and unassuming, saying that it was &quot;not much to talk about&quot;, and that he had been lucky. He remained reluctant to talk about his VC actions, and became known as the &quot;Shy VC&quot;.

The NRRF was demobilised upon its return to the UK. Sullivan wished to return to Australia immediately without waiting for his investiture by King George V. He left England on 1 November aboard the troopship &quot;Nestor&quot;, and travelling the reverse of the route he had followed in 1918, Sullivan returned to Adelaide, the South Australian capital, on 12 December where he was greeted as a hero and afforded a reception at the Adelaide Town Hall. During the voyage he became friends with a Tasmanian VC recipient, Walter Brown. On his return to Maitland, the Maitland Patriotic Society held one last welcome home event, on 6 January 1920, at which Sullivan was the guest of honour.

On hearing of his VC, the National Bank decided to give Sullivan a gratuity of A£100, which was enough to pay for a small house in Adelaide. He was presented with his VC at Government House, Adelaide, on 13 July 1920 by Edward, the Prince of Wales, during his royal tour of Australia. The prince smiled at Sullivan and quipped &quot;Aren&#x27;t you the man who ran away from father?&quot; Soon after his investiture, he became seriously ill with malaria, which he had contracted while in Russia, but he soon recovered. For his service in World War I and the Russian Civil War, in addition to the VC, he was also awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal.

==Later life==
Arthur Sullivan was a very popular man, and his reputation as the &quot;Shy VC&quot; was enhanced by his &quot;unassuming character and reluctance to talk of his exploits&quot;. Upon his return to Australia, he resumed his former employment with the National Bank of Australasia, initially at Maitland from 9 February 1920, and re-immersed himself in the local community and sports. In July 1921, he was promoted and had to be transferred to take up his new appointment as part of the bank&#x27;s relieving staff. He fulfilled this role until 7 May 1925, when he took up the position of accountant at the Orroroo branch which he held until November 1927. While there, he met Dorothy Frances Veale, a nurse at the local hospital, and they began a courtship. During this time he donated a machete he had carried in North Russia to the Australian War Memorial. In 1927 he travelled to Melbourne to participate in a dinner and in the Anzac Day Commemorative March alongside 28 other VC recipients. Later that year he was transferred back to the South Australian relieving staff for four months, followed by a move to New South Wales, still as part of the relieving staff pool. After writing to each other daily during their separation, Sullivan married Dorothy, whose family were from the state of Victoria, at an Anglican church in Fairfield, Victoria, on 5 December 1928.

In 1929 he transferred to the bank&#x27;s head office in Sydney where he and Dorothy lived at Manly for five years. They had three children, Moya born in 1931, and twins Brian and Shirley in 1933. In July 1934, Sullivan was made the manager of the bank&#x27;s branch in Casino, New South Wales. He was closely involved with the community, was president of the local Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia sub-branch, and was widely admired and respected in the town.

===Australian Coronation Contingent===
In 1937, Sullivan was selected to join the Australian contingent to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, although Sullivan had another reason to want to travel to the UK. His friend, British Sergeant Arthur Evans, VC, DCM, formerly of the Lincolnshire Regiment, had died in Australia, and Sullivan had promised to escort Evans&#x27; ashes to his family in the UK. The Australian Coronation Contingent (ACC) comprised 100 soldiers, 25 sailors and 25 airmen. Half the soldiers were serving troops and half were returned members of the AIF. Sullivan was the only VC recipient in the group. As a condition of joining the ACC, Sullivan was re-enlisted as a gunner in the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery on 31 January. The ACC went into camp in Melbourne on 1 February, where they were subjected to drill, physical exercise, route marches and picquet duty for two weeks. On 16 February, the ACC embarked at Melbourne on the ocean liner , and Sullivan was upgraded to a first-class berth. Sullivan did not take to being under military discipline again, and he was charged with two disciplinary offences whilst aboard. 

&quot;Oronsay&quot; sailed via Adelaide, Perth, Colombo, Aden, Suez, Naples, Monte Carlo and Toulon, including several opportunities for shore leave. The ship docked in London on 25 March. Sullivan handed his friend&#x27;s ashes to representatives of the British Legion at Lytham St Annes in Lancashire on 27 March, and they were passed on to Evans&#x27; sister. Despite an intense schedule of parade ground drill, the main purpose of the visit was ambassadorial and ceremonial, so leave was granted most afternoons and evenings and there were many offers of hospitality.

On 9 April 1937, a little over a month before King George VI&#x27;s coronation, Sullivan attended an afternoon tea in St James&#x27;s along with about fifty members of the ACC. He left the tea party early in order to get ready for a reunion dinner that evening at the Royal Fusiliers regimental headquarters located in the Tower of London. About 19:40, as it was getting dark, he was returning to his accommodation at Wellington Barracks on Birdcage Walk, Westminster, when he was mobbed by autograph hunters. While attempting to avoid them, he slipped and struck his head against the kerb, fracturing his skull; a cyclist also struck him. He was taken to hospital, but died soon after, aged 40.

In the wake of Sullivan&#x27;s death, the ACC cancelled all their scheduled activities for three days, including an honour guard they were to mount for the arrival in London of the ACC commander, General Sir Harry Chauvel and his wife. Chauvel was also a friend of Sullivan&#x27;s and, as a director of the National Bank of Australasia, knew Sullivan on a professional level. Sullivan&#x27;s death deeply affected the members of the ACC as well as both governments, with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth sending a message to the Australian high commissioner and former prime minister of Australia, Stanley Bruce, to express their sadness. Because of legislative requirements, Sullivan&#x27;s inquest was conducted with his coffin in the court. The coroner found that his death was accidental, and was caused by a fracture to the base of the skull and lacerations to the brain. One of the autograph hunters provided compelling evidence that Sullivan had fallen before the cyclist collided with him.

===Legacy===
After lying in state with an ACC catafalque party for ninety minutes, Sullivan was afforded a full military funeral at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, on 13 April, which was attended by many notables, including between nine and twelve VC recipients, including one Australian, Frank McNamara. The funeral was said to have been the largest military funeral given to a soldier of his rank. Afterwards, his body was cremated at Golders Green after a short service by the former Australian World War I chaplain George Green. The ACC lined the route to Golders Green, along with thousands of onlookers. On 12 May, to acknowledge Sullivan&#x27;s death, a gap was deliberately left in the ranks of the ACC as they marched in the coronation parade. His ashes were returned to Sydney with the ACC where they were met by Dorothy. A pallbearer party including nine VC recipients was one element of a long procession from Man O&#x27;War Steps to the Northern Suburbs Crematorium with much of the route lined with onlookers. After a short service, his ashes were interred under a tree marked by a simple metal plaque.

The National Bank of Australasia gave Dorothy a gratuity of £250, sufficient to purchase a cottage near Manly so she could be close to friends and family. In March 1939, Sullivan&#x27;s mother presented an enlarged photograph of her son to the Crystal Brook Primary School. In the same year, a bronze plaque was made by a member of the ACC, but owing to World War II it was not placed upon the iron railings of Wellington Barracks, close to where Sullivan was killed, until January 1946. Dorothy attended the 1956 VC centenary celebrations in London, with her travel costs picked up by the National Bank of Australasia. When she died in 1980, she left his medal set, including the VC and King George VI Coronation Medal, to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. They are displayed in the Hall of Valour. In 1996, the Vietnam veteran Keith Payne VC unveiled a plaque in Crystal Brook dedicated to him. In 2015, a memorial to Sullivan was unveiled in Crystal Brook. His name is inscribed on the Maitland War Memorial.

<text>Lizard King Records was a London-based independent record label founded in 2002 by Martin Heath and Dominic Hardisty.

==History==
The label signed US rock band The Killers in July 2003. According to Heath in an interview with HitQuarters, &quot;Everyone in America had turned them down. They had been out for a year looking for a deal but nobody was interested.&quot; The label then released the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;, on a limited press of 500 within the UK and then on a mass scale worldwide in 2004 and 2005. They also released second singles and a debut album before they were then signed by Island Records.

Around 2005/06 Heath and Hardisty decided to go their separate ways and Hardisty formed a new label Marrakesh Records.

Lizard King&#x27;s distribution goes through ADA in America and Pinnacle in the UK.

<text>The tactical crew of a modern military aircraft are the crew members trained and skilled in the use of the aircraft and its warfare systems during combat. They are often directed by a tactical coordinator (tacco) and range from three to nine members. Their responsibilities include directing the pilot(s) on the best way to engage the enemy. The tactical crew operate sensors to detect the enemy, make decisions about the situation and then may direct, local or remote weapons and ordnance to neutralise the activities of the enemy&#x27;s weapons.

In some military forces the tactical crewmembers may also have duties in maintaining the tactical systems when the aircraft is on the ground.

<doc id="1183383" wikidata="Q3472490" url="?curid=1183383" title="Sansa Stark">
<text>Sansa Stark, later Alayne Stone, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin. Introduced in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Sansa is the eldest daughter and second child of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark. She subsequently appeared in the following three novels: &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998), &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), and &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005). While absent from the fifth novel, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, Sansa will return in the forthcoming book, &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;.

In the television adaptation of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, she is portrayed by English actress Sophie Turner. Sansa&#x27;s character development in the novels has received critical praise, though her television counterpart has been met with a more mixed reception. Turner and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Turner also received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019.

==Character and appearances==
Sansa Stark is the second child and the elder of the two daughters born to Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Stark, the ruling liege of the North. She was born and raised in Winterfell with an older brother, Robb, a younger sister, Arya, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, and an older bastard, half-brother Jon Snow. Through her mother, Sansa is also first cousin to Robert Arryn, the lord paramount of The Vale, and the niece of Edmure Tully, the lord paramount of the Riverlands. She was once betrothed to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon and is still legally married (though never consummated) to Tyrion Lannister by the end of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;.

Raised as a noblewoman, Sansa embodies the traditional femininity stereotype expected by the Westerosi society and is widely praised as a courteous and lovable young maiden. Sansa has been described as tall, slim, womanly, and classically beautiful, destined to be a lady or a queen. Inheriting from her mother, Sansa has the Tully features, blue eyes, high cheekbones, and thick auburn hair, but later has her hair dyed dark brown while hiding in the Vale under the guise of &quot;Alayne Stone&quot;, the alleged bastard daughter of Petyr Baelish. Sansa&#x27;s interests are music, poetry, and singing, and she excels in embroidery. She fantasizes about becoming like the damsels of romantic tales who will find a prince, knight, or gentleman to fall in love with. She once owned a direwolf cub named Lady, which was killed in place of her sister Arya&#x27;s direwolf Nymeria after the latter fled after attacking and wounding Crown Prince Joffrey.

Sansa is 11 years old at the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and nearly 14 at the end of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;. The most naive of the Stark children at the start of the series, Sansa chooses the treacherous Queen Cersei over her father. She finds herself abused by her then-fiancé Joffrey and becomes a pawn in the machinations of House Lannister. However, as the story progresses, she matures and becomes more of a strategic player in the political game.

==Storylines==
===&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;===
Sansa Stark begins the novel by being betrothed to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon, believing Joffrey to be a gallant prince. While Joffrey and Sansa are walking through the woods, Joffrey notices Arya sparring with the butcher&#x27;s boy, Mycah. A fight breaks out and Joffrey is attacked by Nymeria (Arya&#x27;s direwolf) after Joffrey threatens to hurt Arya. Sansa lies to King Robert about the circumstances of the fight in order to protect both Joffrey and her sister Arya. Since Arya ran off with her wolf to save it, Sansa&#x27;s wolf is killed instead, estranging the Stark daughters.

During the Tourney of the Hand to honour her father Lord Eddard Stark, Sansa Stark is enchanted by the knights performing in the event. At the request of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey spends a portion of the tourney with Sansa, but near the end he commands his guard Sandor Clegane, better known as The Hound, to take her back to her quarters. Sandor explains how his older brother, Gregor, pushed his face into a brazier of hot coals for playing with one of Gregor&#x27;s wooden toys.

After Eddard discovers the truth of Joffrey&#x27;s paternity, he tells Sansa that he is sending her and Arya back to Winterfell. Sansa is devastated and wishes to stay in King&#x27;s Landing, so she runs off to inform Queen Cersei of her father&#x27;s plan, providing Cersei with the information needed to prevent her and Arya&#x27;s departure from King&#x27;s Landing. After Robert dies and Eddard is arrested for treason, Sansa begs Joffrey to show mercy on her father and he agrees, if Ned will swear an oath of loyalty, but Joffrey executes Eddard anyway, in front of Sansa. Sansa is now effectively a hostage in King&#x27;s Landing and finally sees Joffrey&#x27;s true nature, after he forces her to look at the tarred head of her now-deceased father.

===&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;===
Sansa is a hostage in King&#x27;s Landing, and has learned to be outwardly loyal to King Joffrey to avoid severe physical abuse.

At the celebration for Joffrey&#x27;s name day, she ostensibly saves the life of Ser Dontos Hollard, when he shows up late and inebriated, begging Joffrey to spare him, in turn winning Dontos&#x27; loyalty. Sansa is routinely beaten by Joffrey&#x27;s guards. After her brother has won a battle against Joffrey&#x27;s maternal family, she is publicly beaten in the throne room and has her clothes torn. Tyrion Lannister intervenes on her behalf, and Sandor Clegane gives her his cloak to cover herself. Later, Sandor Clegane saves Sansa from a riot in King&#x27;s Landing.

During the Battle of Blackwater Bay, all of the highborn ladies in King&#x27;s Landing seek refuge within a doubly secure, moated chamber within the Red Keep. There, Queen Cersei talks about her own life experiences with Sansa, when Cersei then flees to the throne room with her son, Tommen, when the tide of the battle falls. This leaves Sansa to stay to give comfort to the ladies before retreating to her own quarters. There she finds Sandor Clegane, who offers to take her away from any imminent danger and the Lannisters themselves, in which Sansa declines. When Sansa awakens, the battle is over. House Lannister has won, but her betrothal to Joffrey is soon ended, so as he may marry Margaery Tyrell whose family just helped turn the tide of battle. However, Joffrey informs Sansa that he still has use for her when married, and to &quot;expect a nightly visitor for a long while&quot;.

===&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;===
In the third book, Sansa is invited to dine with Margaery and her grandmother, Olenna Redwyne. The two women seek to learn the true nature of Joffrey Baratheon now that he and Margaery are betrothed. In turn, Olenna suggests that Sansa should marry her grandson Wilas Tyrell. Sansa reveals the marriage plan to Ser Dontos, who warns her of the Tyrells; however, Sansa develops a close friendship with Margaery and is excited about becoming a part of her family. However, when Tywin learns of the marriage plot he schemes to have Sansa&#x27;s brother Robb Stark killed, knowing that would leave Sansa to inherit Winterfell and the North. He then commands his son Tyrion Lannister to marry Sansa. Tyrion is initially opposed to the marriage, but is eventually enticed by the prospect of becoming Lord of Winterfell, and so agrees to marry her.

Sansa is shocked one morning to learn that she is being fitted for a gown to marry Tyrion that day. Joffrey taunts Sansa and acts on behalf of her father to give her away during the ceremony to add further insult. Sansa ignores Tyrion and refuses to bend as he attempts to put his cloak around her, a marriage ceremony custom in Westeros. In turn, Joffrey commands Ser Dontos to act as a stool so that Tyrion can cloak his bride in spite of his short stature. At the banquet, Sansa dances with many lords, who offer words of comfort; however, Joffrey merely threatens to rape her. Tyrion intervenes and states a desire to castrate Joffrey. After the wedding ceremony, Tyrion chooses not to consummate the marriage due to Sansa&#x27;s lack of desire in him. It is not long before many in King&#x27;s Landing come to know that the marriage was never consummated.

Not long after Sansa&#x27;s marriage, Joffrey and Margaery are wed and afterward a grand feast. At the wedding, Joffrey is poisoned. As Joffrey begins to choke to death, Cersei orders both Tyrion and Sansa arrested, but Sansa manages to flee in the chaos. Once in her room, she gathers her belongings and notices that one of the amethysts from her hairnet, a gift from Ser Dontos, is missing. Sansa immediately realizes that the prince had been poisoned and starts to doubt Ser Dontos&#x27; rescue plan. Understanding that she will be implicated in the murder of Joffrey, she chooses to flee King&#x27;s Landing with the knight anyway. Ser Dontos is later killed by Petyr Baelish, who reveals that he is the mastermind behind nearly all of the capital intrigue. He reveals that he was the one who sent Dontos to her and that Olenna took the amethyst from Sansa&#x27;s hairnet.

Baelish smuggles Sansa to safety in the Vale of Arryn, where she poses as his bastard daughter Alayne Stone. She is taken to her aunt Lysa Arryn, now married to Baelish. Lysa declares that Sansa must marry her sickly boy Robert, heir to the Vale. Petyr Baelish and Lysa are wed; however, Lysa becomes jealous when she witnesses Baelish kissing her niece. Lysa later attempts to murder Sansa, but she is saved once again by Baelish, who kills Lysa.

===&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;===
After Lysa&#x27;s death, Sansa becomes mistress of the Eyrie and still pretends to be Baelish&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, Alayne Stone. Baelish successfully pacifies the lords of the Vale, who suspected Baelish&#x27;s hand in Lysa&#x27;s death. Afterwards, Baelish reveals to Sansa his plans to eventually marry her to the heir to the Vale, Harrold Hardyng, and his long-range plans to reveal her true identity and reclaim the North. Sansa acts as a mother figure to Robert Arryn, caring for him after the death of Lysa. By now she has lost much of her naivety, as well as trust for Baelish.

==Adaptations==
===Media===
Sansa appears in several adaptations of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. She is a main character for eight seasons of the HBO television series, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2011—2019), and the graphic novel series, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (2011—2014). She has also appeared in the video game &quot;&quot; (2018) based on the television series interpretation of the character.

In the television series, Sansa is adapted by D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. She first appears in the series two years older than her book counterpart, and her storyline diverges significantly from the fifth season onwards. However, there are also numerous differences from the beginning of the series.

===Television storylines===
====Season 1====
Sansa is first seen with Arya at Winterfell, during their embroidery lesson with Septa Mordane. Following the arrival of Robert Baratheon and his escort at Winterfell, he insists to Ned that Joffrey and Sansa should be married in order to join their houses. Sansa, who is desperate to leave Winterfell, begs Catelyn to make Ned agree to the engagement.

Joffrey is bitten by Arya&#x27;s direwolf Nymeria while bullying Mycah the butcher&#x27;s boy and Arya. Sansa, an eyewitness, claims to be ignorant of the event at the inquest. As retribution for Joffrey&#x27;s injury, Cersei convinces Robert to have Sansa&#x27;s direwolf, Lady, killed in place of the now-missing Nymeria.

After arriving at King&#x27;s Landing, Sansa attends the Hand&#x27;s Tourney where Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish tells Sansa and Arya the story behind Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane&#x27;s gruesome facial burns. As time passes, Sansa wears her hair like a southerner and is more flippant with Mordane, expressing fears she will fail to give Joffrey a male heir.

Following Ned&#x27;s initial resignation as Hand of the King, Sansa is devastated to hear she must return to Winterfell. She likens Joffrey to a lion and says he is nothing like Robert Baratheon. This statement inspires Ned to investigate the Baratheon family line, prompting him to realise that Cersei&#x27;s children are bastards fathered by her twin brother Jaime Lannister, not Robert Baratheon.

Following Robert&#x27;s death and Ned&#x27;s arrest for treason, all Stark servants in King&#x27;s Landing are executed. Cersei exhorts Sansa to write Robb and Catelyn, imploring them to swear fealty to Joffrey. At court, Sansa pleads for her father&#x27;s life; all agree on the condition Ned confesses his treason and swears fealty. Sansa is present at the Great Sept of Baelor and is horrified when Joffrey orders Ned&#x27;s execution, fainting as Ned is beheaded.

Grieving the death of her father, Sansa is forced by Joffrey to look upon the spiked heads of both Ned and Septa Mordane. She begs to return home, but he informs Sansa that they are still to be married, and she will stay and obey. Joffrey promises to present Robb&#x27;s head also, to which she retorts that Robb may give her Joffrey&#x27;s head, instead. While on the catwalk, Sansa moves to push Joffrey to his death but is stopped by Sandor Clegane, who offers practical consoling advice.

====Season 2====
As the War of the Five Kings progresses, Sansa&#x27;s position in King&#x27;s Landing becomes increasingly perilous. On Joffrey&#x27;s name day celebration, Sansa saves an inebriated Ser Dontos Hollard from execution, by convincing Joffrey to instead make Dontos his fool. While at the celebration, Tyrion offers his condolences for Ned&#x27;s death, in response to which Sansa insists her family are all traitors, and she is loyal to Joffrey. Later on, when her eldest brother Robb wins a battle against the Lannisters, Sansa is publicly beaten and humiliated in front of the court by Joffrey and Ser Meryn (on Joffrey&#x27;s orders), as payment for her brother&#x27;s crimes.

Tyrion Lannister enters the court and rescues Sansa. Despite being a dwarf, Tyrion takes pity on Sansa&#x27;s situation and offers to have the engagement called off. Sansa maintains her facade that she is loyal to Joffrey, which impresses Tyrion to the point he believes Sansa might just survive King&#x27;s Landing.

Tyrion has his lover, Shae, positioned as Sansa&#x27;s handmaiden. Sansa and Shae form a friendship in which Sansa is able to vent about her hatred of the Lannisters without fear of being betrayed. Sansa is present when the royal family bids farewell to Joffrey&#x27;s sister, Myrcella, on her departure to Dorne to form an alliance between the Lannisters and the Martells. While returning to the Red Keep, a riot breaks out in the streets of King&#x27;s Landing, amidst which Sansa finds herself caught in the fray. Three peasant men chase Sansa and attempt to rape her before she is rescued and returned to the castle by Sandor Clegane.

The following morning, Sansa has a nightmare of the incident and wakes up in a bloodstained bed. Sansa has her first period, thus meaning she can now bear Joffrey&#x27;s children. Sansa and Shae attempt to conceal this, which involves Shae&#x27;s threatening to kill a witness handmaiden if she tells anyone. However, Sandor Clegane sees the blood, and both Cersei and Joffrey are informed.

Cersei invites Sansa to her chambers to share some of her wisdom and experience as a wife and a mother. Cersei reminisces that her husband Robert was not interested in her childbirth. Cersei explains to Sansa that while Sansa may never love Joffrey (and vice versa), she will love his children. Cersei warns Sansa that the more people she loves, the weaker she will be. Therefore, Sansa should only love her children, as it is the only love she has no choice in.

Before the Battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey forces Sansa to kiss the blade of his sword, while bragging he will kill Stannis himself. Sansa taunts Joffrey by remarking he must be battling in the vanguard, which he would not be. Joffrey promises that she will lick Stannis&#x27;s blood, and later her brother Robb&#x27;s blood off his sword. During the battle, Sansa takes refuge with Cersei, Shae, and the other women and children of King&#x27;s Landing. A drunk Cersei declares to Sansa and the women that if the city falls, they will all be raped while the city is sacked. Cersei continues her taunting by also telling Sansa that tears are not the only weapons women have; the greatest weapon they own is between their legs. Following Cersei&#x27;s departure from the refuge with Tommen, Sansa leaves to hide in her bedchamber, where she finds Sandor Clegane. Sandor, about to leave King&#x27;s Landing, offers to take Sansa home. Sansa declines, insisting Stannis would not harm her. After the battle is won by the Lannister-Tyrell forces, Loras Tyrell asks Joffrey to take his sister, Margaery, as his bride. Joffrey accepts the proposal, which annuls his betrothal to Sansa. Sansa, while pretending to be devastated, is secretly delighted she no longer has to marry Joffrey. However, Petyr Baelish warns that while Sansa is no longer engaged, Joffrey would have greater rein to abuse Sansa, especially now she is a woman. Petyr assures Sansa he will help get her home, in which Sansa once again displays a facade, asserting King&#x27;s Landing is her home. Petyr advises Sansa that everyone in King&#x27;s Landing is a liar and that they are much more cunning than her.

====Season 3====
With her engagement to Joffrey annulled, Sansa does not have to worry about spending the rest of her life with him, but is with lesser protection from tormentors. Petyr Baelish, an old friend of her mother&#x27;s with a reputation for being sadistic and cunning, tells her that he can smuggle her out of the city, but she is reluctant. Sansa finds a friend in Loras Tyrell, who is kind to her and whom she hopes will ask for her hand. His sister, Joffrey&#x27;s new fiancée, Margaery, is also kind to her and takes her to dine with her grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, who asks her for her opinion of Joffrey. Sansa reveals Joffrey&#x27;s true, cruel personality, but Margaery and Lady Olenna merely pass it by as a trivial matter, saying there is nothing to be done to change a man&#x27;s character, especially a king&#x27;s. Sansa&#x27;s affection for Loras grows; she is unaware that Loras is gay and, while he likes her and enjoys spending time with her, he can never love her. Margaery proposes the idea that Loras will marry Sansa, meaning Sansa can leave King&#x27;s Landing, which delights Sansa. However, when this plan is reported to the Lannisters, they fear that the Tyrells will pose an even greater threat with a member of House Stark as one of their allies and quickly end the idea of the engagement, by betrothing Loras to Cersei and engaging Sansa to Tyrion, which both Sansa and Shae are against. However, the day of the wedding, Tyrion promises not to harm her and, as she prepares to consummate the marriage, Tyrion realizes how unhappy Sansa is and tells her that she doesn&#x27;t have to consummate it unless she wants to. When Sansa asks Tyrion what would happen if she never wants him in her bed, he quips, &quot;And so my watch begins.&quot;

Sansa and Tyrion do form a somewhat friendly relationship, as he is kind to her and treats her well, and she soon realizes there are worse Lannisters to be wed to. However, their cordial relationship suffers a crushing blow when Sansa receives news of Robb and Catelyn&#x27;s deaths at the Red Wedding, an event orchestrated by Tywin Lannister, Tyrion&#x27;s father.

====Season 4====
Sansa, still distraught over the death of Robb and Catelyn, is approached by Dontos Hollard, a former knight whom Sansa had convinced Joffrey to make his fool instead of executing him. Dontos gives her a necklace, claiming it was his mother&#x27;s. However, the necklace turns out to be a fake; one of the gems contains the poison which Lady Olenna Tyrell uses to poison Joffrey at his wedding to Margaery Tyrell. In the commotion, Sansa is taken by Dontos, to Baelish&#x27;s boat in Blackwater Bay. Baelish smuggles Sansa from King&#x27;s Landing after revealing the nature of the necklace and has Dontos killed with a crossbow.

Lord Baelish, with Sansa posing as his niece Alayne Stone, pass through the Blood Gates to the Eyrie and to the keep of Lysa Arryn. Lysa initially invites them with open arms, revealing she knows exactly who her niece is, and they are welcome to be housed. It is soon revealed however, Lysa mistrusts the relationship between Sansa and Baelish accusing Baelish of violating Sansa and accusing him of never loving her. Later in the keep, Sansa strikes Lysa&#x27;s son Robin and Baelish appears. Baelish then proclaims his undying love for her deceased mother, Catelyn, and he shares a kiss with a stunned Sansa, with Lysa watching from above. Sansa is immediately summoned to Lysa&#x27;s throne room, where she believes she had been summoned for striking her son. Lysa reveals she had observed the kiss, and though defending herself and Baelish&#x27;s actions against her, Lysa holds her to the Moon Door, a trap door that leads hundreds of feet down into the mountains below. Baelish intervenes before she gets the chance to execute Sansa and pushes Lysa to her death instead as he proclaimed his love for her sister. Then Baelish later claimed to the lords of the Vale that she committed suicide. Sansa is called to give testimony, and although she reveals her true identity, she supports Baelish&#x27;s story. She then joins Baelish and her cousin Robin Arryn on a tour of the Vale.

====Season 5====
Baelish brokers a marriage between Sansa and Ramsay Bolton, now the heir to the North after the death of Robb Stark. Though Sansa is reluctant to marry Ramsay, as his father Roose had personally murdered Robb, Baelish persuades her by claiming that the marriage will give her the opportunity to avenge her family. On the way to Winterfell, they encounter Brienne of Tarth, who had sworn to Catelyn Stark to take Sansa to safety and tries to convince Sansa to come with her; Baelish has her chased off by his men, but Brienne follows Sansa to Winterfell regardless. Though initially charming, Ramsay&#x27;s sadistic nature becomes apparent when Sansa discovers that he has captured and enslaved Ned&#x27;s former ward Theon Greyjoy, and forced him to assume the identity of his serving man, Reek. Sansa and Ramsay wed in front of the Godswood. That night, Ramsay rapes Sansa, and forces Reek to watch. Over the next few days, Ramsay continues to rape and beat Sansa every night, and keeps her locked in her bedchamber. Sansa begs Reek to help her signal her northern allies by lighting a candle in the broken tower. Reek, wishing to spare Sansa from Bolton&#x27;s wrath, instead tells Ramsay. He proceeds to flay the maid who had told Sansa of the signal, and forces Sansa to look at her corpse. Furious, Sansa confronts Reek, and goes so far to claim that he deserved to be tortured by Ramsay. Theon agrees but reveals that he had failed to capture Sansa&#x27;s brothers Bran and Rickon, and killed two farm boys in their place. Theon&#x27;s revelation causes Sansa&#x27;s anger towards her former friend to cool down somewhat. While the Boltons prepare to battle Stannis Baratheon&#x27;s advancing forces, Sansa signals to Brienne, unaware that she has left to kill Stannis. When help does not come, Sansa attempts to return to her room but is caught by Ramsay&#x27;s paramour Myranda, who threatens to mutilate Sansa. Finally snapping, Theon throws Myranda to her death, just as the Bolton forces return. Fearful of Ramsay&#x27;s reaction, Theon and Sansa jump from Winterfell&#x27;s battlements into the snow.

====Season 6====
Sansa and Theon are captured by Bolton soldiers in the forest outside Winterfell, but Brienne and her squire Podrick Payne arrive in time to rescue them and kill the Bolton soldiers. This time, Sansa accepts Brienne&#x27;s loyalty. While Theon returns to the Iron Islands, Sansa, Brienne, and Podrick journey on to Castle Black, where she reunites with her half-brother Jon Snow, who has just resigned as Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch. Sansa tries to persuade Jon to help her drive the Boltons out of Winterfell; although Jon initially refuses, he changes his mind after Ramsay sends a letter to Jon in which he gloats that he holds Rickon Stark captive and threatens to kill the Starks and the Wildlings Jon has let through the Wall if Sansa is not returned. Before Jon and Sansa leave Castle Black, Baelish arranges a meeting with Sansa in Mole&#x27;s Town. He insists that he was unaware of Ramsay&#x27;s nature and offers the support of the Knights of the Vale, also mentioning that her great-uncle Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully has captured Riverrun from House Frey. Sansa sends Baelish away, declaring that she never wants to see him again, but sends Brienne to the Riverlands to convince the Blackfish to aid the Starks.

Although Jon and Sansa are only able to win over a handful of Northern lords, Jon insists that they must march on Winterfell, despite Sansa&#x27;s objections. Sansa sends a letter to Baelish asking for his aid, and the Vale forces arrive at Winterfell in time to defeat the Boltons, though too late to save Rickon. Ramsay is captured and Sansa has him fed to his hounds. In the aftermath of the battle, Sansa apologizes for not telling Jon about Baelish and the Knights of the Vale. Jon forgives her and asks that they trust each other completely from now on. While in the godswood, Baelish tells Sansa the North will rally behind her and confesses his ambition to rule Westeros with Sansa at his side, but Sansa rebuffs his advances. Later, the Northmen and Valemen declare Jon the new King in the North.

====Season 7====
Jon travels to Dragonstone to negotiate with Daenerys Targaryen for her support against the White Walkers, leaving Sansa as regent in his absence. Soon after, Bran and Arya return to Winterfell. Littlefinger seeks to drive a wedge between Sansa and Arya by letting Arya find Sansa&#x27;s letter to Robb asking him to bend the knee to Joffrey, causing Arya to confront Sansa. Sansa sneaks into Arya&#x27;s quarters and comes across the &quot;faces&quot; Arya has taken from the various people she has killed on her travels; Arya catches Sansa and tells Sansa of her ability to assume people&#x27;s identities with the faces before she threatens her.

Sansa later receives an invitation to King&#x27;s Landing, where Jon intends to present Cersei, who is now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, with proof of the White Walkers&#x27; existence. Refusing to return to King&#x27;s Landing, she sends Brienne as her representative.

Sansa shows Littlefinger the letter she received from Jon following the meeting in King&#x27;s Landing, in which Jon states that he had pledged his support to Daenerys Targaryen. Littlefinger continues his manipulation of Sansa by claiming that Jon has betrayed the North, Sansa should seize power from Jon, and suggests Arya intends to murder her to become Lady of Winterfell. Sansa summons Arya to the great hall and begins an accusation of treason and murder, before directing the accusation towards Littlefinger. With help from their brother Bran (now known as Three-Eyed Raven), Sansa and Arya reveal that they are aware of Baelish&#x27;s numerous crimes, including the murder of Lysa Arryn, orchestrating the murders of both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, and manipulating the Starks and Lannisters to war. Baelish tries to plead for his life, but Sansa refuses and sentences Littlefinger to death. Arya executes him. The Stark sisters later resolve their differences and acknowledge that the Starks must stand together to survive the winter. They remember their father telling them, &quot;The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.&quot;

====Season 8====
Sansa welcomes Daenerys and her court, including Tyrion, to Winterfell. Tyrion declares that the Lannister troops will be marching north as well to defend against the dead, but Sansa is skeptical; her fears are confirmed when Jaime Lannister arrives in Winterfell and he reveals Cersei&#x27;s treachery. Sansa wishes Jaime dead for attacking Ned in King&#x27;s Landing, but spares him when Brienne vouches for him. Sansa suspects that Jon&#x27;s decision to pledge to Daenerys as queen is due to his love for Daenerys. Sansa is wary of Daenerys but when speaking with her in private, Daenerys assures Sansa that her love for Jon is also genuine and they reach common ground. However, the situation becomes tense when Sansa asks of the North&#x27;s independence after Daenerys has conquered Westeros. They are interrupted by Theon&#x27;s arrival, who has come to help defend Winterfell.

Sansa watches the battle against the dead from Winterfell&#x27;s battlements, but when the Dothraki are easily overrun, Arya orders Sansa to seek refuge in the crypts with the other non-combatants. The Night King reanimates the dead around Winterfell, including the Starks buried in the crypts, but the undead fall when Arya kills the Night King, allowing Sansa, Tyrion, and the others in the crypts to survive. Sansa is present for the funeral for those fallen in battle, including Theon, who was killed defending Bran. She places a Stark pin in Theon&#x27;s armor before he is cremated to honor him as an ally of the Starks.

Sansa is reunited with the Hound at the victory feast. The Hound declares that Sansa would not have experienced the horrors she faced had she fled King&#x27;s Landing with him, but Sansa acknowledges that her experiences made her wiser. At the war council, Sansa and Daenerys disagree over giving the Northern army time to recover before marching on King&#x27;s Landing. After the council, Sansa and Arya tell Jon they don&#x27;t trust Daenerys but Jon defends Daenerys. Jon confides he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark after swearing Sansa and Arya to secrecy. Sansa reveals this to Tyrion.

Daenerys takes King&#x27;s Landing, but lays waste to the surrendered populace during which Cersei is also killed. Jon tries but fails to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. When Jon is arrested by the Unsullied, Sansa camps the Northern army outside the city and travels to King&#x27;s Landing to convene a council to determine the fates of Jon, Tyrion, and Westeros. Tyrion suggests Bran be crowned king, to near-unanimous approval. Arya and Sansa abstain, and Sansa asserts to Bran that the North has sacrificed too much to remain part of the Seven Kingdoms, declaring the North&#x27;s independence. Sansa, Arya, and Bran bid farewell to Jon, who is exiled. Sansa returns to Winterfell and is crowned Queen in the North.

==Reception==
As her storyline has progressed, Sansa has received critical scrutiny and praise for the development of her character and her emergence from a naive girl to a strong young woman. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Sansa as No. 4 on a list of the &quot;Top 40 &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; Characters&quot;, saying that Sansa is &quot;often overlooked in favor of her killer kid sister&quot;, but that her &quot;quiet, innate political shrewedness and emotional strength have enabled her to survive&quot;, and calling her &quot;the show&#x27;s best-kept secret&quot;. In &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranking of the 48 best &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; main characters in the first five seasons, Sansa was ranked at No. 4, ahead of the more popular Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Tyrion Lannister, stating that &quot;Sansa has been kind of great in Season 6, turning into the sort of badass we always hoped but never thought she actually could become&quot;.

Writing for Mic, Julianne Ross said that Sansa is &quot;often cited as one of the most reviled characters on &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;&quot;, and &quot;not coincidentally, she is also one of the most classically feminine characters on the show.&quot; Ross criticized the heavy hatred for Sansa, particularly in contrast to her sister Arya, opining that this is because &quot;she doesn&#x27;t fit the narrow &#x27;strong female character&#x27; mold we&#x27;re used to rooting for.&quot; In an MTV article, Crystal Bell regarded Sansa as the most relatable character in the series. &quot;She&#x27;s often despised for having no agency&quot;, Bell wrote, but she is hated for her passivity as a woman as it &quot;denotes weakness&quot; and &quot;she is the epitome of femininity&quot; in the series. Bell felt that Sansa&#x27;s greatest strength is her &quot;unwavering resilience&quot;.

Sansa received acclaim in Season 6 of the show, during which she began her quest to retake her family home and exact revenge on those who wronged her. Megan Garber of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; praised the show&#x27;s decision to have Sansa be the one orchestrating Ramsay&#x27;s death in &quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot;, saying that &quot;in the end, it was Sansa making the decisions about who would be the victim.&quot; Bennett Madison of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote: &quot;As far back as King&#x27;s Landing, Sansa&#x27;s been quietly protecting herself ... learning how to game the system, and slithering through situations that would have gotten the best of the show&#x27;s more flashy or impulsive characters.&quot; In &quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot;, she was &quot;defiantly, gloriously correct in her convictions&quot; and &quot;saved the day with her foresight and savvy&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, actress Sophie Turner said that &quot;[Sansa is] no longer a pawn in anyone&#x27;s game; she&#x27;s no longer a prisoner...she&#x27;s the one taking charge and doing her own thing, which is very exciting&quot;. Turner later told &quot;Time&quot; magazine about how gratifying it was to watch Sansa&#x27;s development during Season 6 and defended the show on the criticism of its cruel treatment of women: &quot;In my opinion, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; is not sexist, and it&#x27;s accurate to medieval time. The show puts social boundaries on the women, and they break out of these boundaries.&quot;

=== Controversy ===
In the episode &quot;Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken&quot;, Sansa&#x27;s rape was the main subject of controversy for the season&#x27;s deviations from the books. The majority of professional criticism concerned the showrunners&#x27; decision to have Ramsay rape Sansa, with most critics describing the scene as gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. &quot;This grim scene was difficult for the show to justify,&quot; said Charlotte Runcie of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Joanna Robinson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; added, &quot;this rape scene undercuts all the agency that’s been growing in Sansa since the end of last season. [...] I’d never advocate that &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (or any work of fiction) shy away from edgy plots out of fear of pushback or controversy. But edgy plots should always accomplish something above pure titillation or shock value and what, &quot;exactly&quot;, was accomplished here?&quot; Christopher Orr wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;I continue to be astonished that showrunners Benioff and Weiss still apparently believe that their tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence of George R.R. Martin’s source material is a strength rather than the defining weakness of their adaptation.&quot; Myles McNutt of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;The issue with the show returning to rape as a trope is not simply because there have been thinkpieces speaking out against it, and is not solely driven by the rational concerns lying at the heart of those thinkpieces. It’s also that the show has lost my faith as a viewer.&quot; Writers from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; and &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; all disapproved of the decision to use Sansa&#x27;s victimization as a motivating agent for Theon, saying that the scene undermined Sansa&#x27;s character development: &quot;Was it really important to make that scene about Theon&#x27;s pain?&quot; wrote Joanna Robinson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Other critics responded positively to the scene. Sean T. Collins of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;[B]y involving a multidimensional main character instead of one introduced primarily to suffer, the series has a chance to grant this story the gravity and seriousness it deserves. Sarah Hughes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;I have repeatedly made clear that I’m not a fan of rape as a plot device—but the story of Ramsay and Sansa’s wedding was more than that. [...] The writers are walking a very fine line here. They handled it well tonight, telling a gothic tale of innocence sacrificed&quot;. Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the scene &quot;managed to maintain a fine balance, employing a dignity and care for the experiences of victims that &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; has not always demonstrated.&quot;

Some critics questioned why this scene in particular should generate outrage when similar scenes have not. Sara Stewart of the &quot;New York Post&quot; pointed out that the rape and sexual abuse of both female and male characters is typical for &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;: &quot;Why are we suddenly so outraged about the rape of Sansa Stark, when this show has served up a steady diet of sexual assault and violence against women since its first season began?&quot; Cathy Young of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, writing in &quot;Time&quot; noted what she calls a lack of complaint in response to the sexual mistreatment of male characters in earlier seasons, specifically the literal emasculation of Theon Greyjoy and the sexual assault of Gendry.

Robinson wrote in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;if we can say one positive thing about that scene it&#x27;s that Allen nailed his performance. Theon&#x27;s horror mirrored our own and the camera—focusing on his reaction—let our minds fill in the blanks.&quot; Turner defended the scene as an artistic challenge for herself as an actor, saying, &quot;When I read that scene, I kinda loved it. I love the way Ramsay had Theon watching. It was all so messed up. It&#x27;s also so daunting for me to do it .. [it is] so emotional for her.&quot;

Some viewers, including U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, announced that they would stop watching the show because of this scene. According to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, this scene and increased use of streaming services are likely reasons why ratings dropped from 6.2 million viewers for this episode to 5.4 million for the next episode, &quot;The Gift.&quot;

===Recognition and awards===
Sophie Turner has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Sansa including an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019. For her performance in the series she earned the Glamour Award for Best UK TV Actress in 2016 and 2017, and an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016.

<text>The Ochoco National Forest is located in the Ochoco Mountains in Central Oregon in the United States, north and east of the city of Prineville, location of the national forest headquarters. It encompasses of rimrock, canyons, geologic oddities, dense pine forests, and high desert terrain, as well as the headwaters of the North Fork Crooked River. A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was .

In descending order of forestland area, it occupies lands within Crook, Harney, Wheeler, and Grant counties. The national forest also administers the Crooked River National Grassland, which is in Jefferson County.

==Wilderness==
The forest contains three wilderness areas comprising :
*Mill Creek Wilderness at 
*Bridge Creek Wilderness at 
*Black Canyon Wilderness at 

== Administration ==
The land is divided into three ranger districts:

* Lookout Mountain Ranger District
* Paulina Ranger District
* Crooked River Grasslands District

The Lookout Mountain and Paulina districts are located in Prineville while the Crooked River Grasslands are administered from office in Madras.

The former Snow Mountain Ranger District is now administered by the Malheur National Forest, as part of the Emigrant Creek Ranger District.

== Ecology ==
The Ochoco mountains are home to numerous species of interest to the Oregon Conservation Strategy under the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife including the Pacific Marten, Ferruginous Hawk, Greater Sage Grouse, Wolverine, and Piliated Woodpecker.

Due to sections of the forest representing winter range for mule deer and elk, sections of the forest prohibit the use of motorized vehicles from December through May.

==Recreation==
Popular recreational activities in the Ochoco National Forest include hiking, fishing, camping, hunting, horseback riding, stargazing, birding, rock hounding, kayaking, and rock climbing.

<text>Thames Ditton is a suburban village on the River Thames, in the Elmbridge borough of Surrey, England. Apart from a large inhabited island in the river, it lies on the southern bank, centred southwest of Charing Cross in central London. Thames Ditton is just outside Greater London but within the Greater London Urban Area as defined by the Office for National Statistics. Its clustered village centre and shopping area on a winding High Street is surrounded by housing, schools and sports areas. Its riverside faces the Thames Path and Hampton Court Palace Gardens and golf course in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Its most commercial area is spread throughout its conservation area and contains restaurants, cafés, shops and businesses.

Its railway station, one of two on the Hampton Court branch line, is from the riverside end of the village centre and the village of Weston Green that hived off from it in 1939.

Thames Ditton joins Long Ditton and Weston Green in occupying the land between Surbiton, Esher and East Molesey. Although reduced to less than , it formerly covered more than .

==History==
===Pre–1800===
The first written record of Thames Ditton is in a charter dated 983 when King Æthelred the Unready granted to Æthelmær, his minister, nine hides (&quot;cassati&quot;) at Thames Ditton, Surrey. In &quot;The Cartulary of the Abbey of Eynsham Transaction&quot;, King Æthelred sent to Eynsham Abbey confirmation of the foundation (in 1005) by Æthelmær, the endowment including 20 hides at Esher, Surrey (granted by Beorhthelm, bishop, to Æthelweard, and bequeathed by Æthelweard to his son, Æthelmær); and land at Thames Ditton, Surrey, among several other items.

Two Dittons appear in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ditone&quot; and &quot;Ditune&quot;. Under the Normans, the one now identified with Thames Ditton was held by Wadard from the Bishop of Bayeux. Its Domesday assets were: hides; part of a mill worth 1s 3d, ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 20 hogs. It rendered £4. There were four households. Other manors that came to form part of Thames Ditton were those of Weston, Imworth (or Imber), and for a while, Claigate (Claygate). From Domesday, the combined population of Thames Ditton (4), Long Ditton (11), Immeworth (2) and Weston (9) was some 26 households of villagers and smallholders.

Later, the manors of both Dittons were reunited when Anne Gould inherited the manor of Thames Ditton and married Thomas Evelyn, who had inherited the manor of (Long) Ditton. By that time the manor of Thames Ditton amounted to little by way of land and, to all effects, Thames Ditton comprised mainly the manors of Imworth and of Weston, with some lands from Claygate, Long Ditton and even Kingston extending into the present-day boundaries of Thames Ditton and Weston Green. Thus it remained still in 1848, comprising &quot;about &quot;.

Under Eynsham Abbey, Thames Ditton had been parcelled with Esher. It was in the Saxon&#x27;s Elmbridge hundred, where its local aristocracy would convene for strategic and administrative purposes. Salter&#x27;s introduction to the &quot;Cartulary&quot; notes that along with Esher, Eynsham appears to have lost Thames Ditton by the time of the Norman Conquest. The Domesday survey recorded that (before the Conquest) Ditton had been held by Earl Harald (subsequently King until 1066). In Domesday, Thames Ditton (as well as adjacent Long Ditton and &#x27;Ember&#x27; or Immeworth, later Imber Court) is listed within Kingston Hundred; in Speed&#x27;s map of Surrey (1611) it is said to be in Kingston Hundred. Subsequent records assert not only Thames Ditton was in Kingston Hundred but remained part of its parish as a chapelry.

Following the Normon Conquest, part of the land was granted to the monks of Merton Priory by Gilbert the Norman. A chapel – now the church – was built, the first recorded incumbent being in 1179. The chapelry of Thames Ditton was subordinate to Kingston Rectory until the late 1700s. By Act of Parliament in 1769, Thames Ditton, which had from the early 1600s assumed the civilian vestry responsibilities of a parish, became a separate curacy and an ecclesiastical parish in its own right, subsuming Hinchley Wood, Claygate and Weston Green. (Long Ditton remained a separate parish, not within the Kingston Rectory, despite attempts during Cromwell&#x27;s time to fuse the two).

But, the advowson remained in the hands of the Hardinge family of Kingston until Nicholas Hardinge sold it, along with the advowson of Kingston and other subordinate chapelries, to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1781, subject to a long lease otherwise disposed of. The Hardinges retained the right of presentation for a period (then subsequently leased that too). Rev Henry Hardinge, Rector of Kingston, was also the incumbent at St Nicholas for a brief and ill-starred time.

Isolated on marshy wetlands, the village seems to have avoided the travails of Kingston (a strategic garrison town often pillaged). It remained a relatively insignificant settlement of farming Manors. The Chancery Rolls of 1212 do note that King John was entertained at Ditton by Geoffrey Fitz Pierre, the Chief Justice. This was most likely on the site of Imber Court. Another substantial house was on the site close to the chapel of ease, now the Church.

Thames Ditton became more significant after Hampton Court Palace was built by Thomas Wolsey in the early 16th century. Once the palace was claimed by Henry VIII in 1525, palace officials and other workers took up residence in Thames Ditton. With Thames Ditton Island, it was a useful crossing point across the River Thames from Surrey to the palace in Middlesex, before the bridge at Hampton Court was built in 1752–1753.

Development in the village suffered greatly when Henry VIII acquired most of the lands and enclosed them within the deer Chase in the Honour of Hampton Court. Following his death, residents of the area successfully petitioned for it to be de-Chased, and normal activities resumed. From that time the convenience of Thames Ditton to London – two or three hours by horse or carriage; the cachet of nearby Hampton Court, Claremont and Esher Place, Royal Kingston with its market and coach service, and the still rural aspect of the village prompted many to make their main or second homes there. A richly diverse crop of residents both notable and less so resulted.

During the 18th century, lawlessness grew in the region, and the roads around the village were plagued with highwaymen, in particular the turnpike to Portsmouth. Influential men began to band together to deal with crime. Following a meeting at the Harrow Inn on 26 January 1792, a group of some 80 local men (a significant percentage of the sparse population) formed a group for &quot;the protection of persons and property&quot;. They made a list of crimes, fines and rewards (transcript of document in the T. S. Mercer Collection of parish records, Dittons Library).

An Act of Parliament of 1769 enabled the parish to be formally established and to secede from the parish of All Saints&#x27;, Kingston. Many significant residents of Thames Ditton were also senior figures in the administration of Kingston, and the courts of Kingston held jurisdiction over both Kingston and Elmbridge Hundreds. Thames Ditton came under the Metropolitan Police rather than the Surrey Police until the present millennium. Most other aspects of local administration in the Victorian era: roads, drains, gas, electricity, the Poor Union, were managed by Kingston until reform of local government led to the establishment of the Esher and the Dittons Urban District Council in 1894. But, Thames Ditton was always clearly outside the area governed by the Corporation of Kingston. In 1965 the government had difficulty drawing the boundaries of Greater London satisfactorily to please various interests.

===Post–1800===
In 1801, the population of Thames Ditton parish, which at that stage included Weston Green, Hinchley Wood and Claygate, was still small: 1,288 people living in 265 houses; 167 of the workers were occupied in agriculture and 87 in trade, manufacture and handicraft. Due to the large number of mansions and estates in the area, there would have been many domestic and ancillary employees living in the village, some working at Hampton Court Palace.

During the 19th century, the village continued to grow, with the arrival of the London and South Western Railway in 1849 and the building of the first school. Market gardens were established in the fields around the Church to supply the metropolis. By the end of the century, the population had almost doubled but was still fairly sparse. In 1913 a booklet of &#x27;The Suburban and Provincial Development Association&#x27; noted: &quot;the population of the district is only about two to the acre&quot; and &quot;some of the trains perform the journey to Waterloo in as little as 24 minutes.&quot; And another local booklet of that period commented that &quot;Thames Ditton...may be said generally to abound in pretty villas whose inhabitants seem to vie with each other in friendly rivugalry to beautify them.&quot; Either side of 1900 the convenience to London and boating attractions of the Thames helped to make Thames Ditton a destination of choice for weekenders including a sizeable community from the world of popular entertainment in London. Local life was completely changed by the expansion of London&#x27;s suburbs, and in the period between the World Wars most of the farming fields were sold off for housing development, and the big landowners, now richer, decamped.

Around 1812, a school for girls was started thanks to wealthy people such as Baroness de Ros. Some form of National School for girls operated from September 1812, and boys were taught from 1818. At least 60 girls were being educated in 1816–17, some coming from Molesey and Tolworth.

In the 1840s, there was a National School housed near St Nicholas&#x27; churchyard. In 1860, the Rev EH Rogers laid the first stone of the schools at the end of Church Walk where generations of Thames Ditton children were educated. It was expanded in 1877.

There had long been a wharf near the Swan Inn on the river and this became a site for local industry. A &#x27;Melting House&#x27; between the churchyard and the river became the Thames Ditton Foundry, a skilled bronze foundry in 1874, and successively as Cox &amp; Son (1874–1880), Drew &amp; Sons (1880–1883), Moore &amp; Co (1883–1897), Hollinshead &amp; Burton (1897–1902) and A.B. Burton (1902–1939); the foundry was supreme in its field. It produced fine bronze statues exported worldwide, including the statue commonly known as Eros Piccadilly Circus, Victoria Memorial (London) and the giant Quadriga (Wellington Arch) at Hyde Park Corner. and the Captain James Cook statue in Hyde Park, Sydney. Nearby, at Ferry Works on the river bank, was the factory of Willans &amp; Robinson who in the late 19th century made a high-speed steam engine (the Willans engine) used for early generation of electric power in places such as the Vienna State Opera. The works is preserved and in use by a number of commercial companies including a broadcast software developer, an international communications and information technology company serving government and commercial markets, a company specialising in numerically controlled machines and a leading architectural practice.

During 1901 and 1908, John Ernest Hutton produced a motorcycle called Princeps at Thames Ditton.

Between 1911 and 1984, the village was home to the AC Cars factory, first at Ferry Works and later in the High Street at a site since developed into a residential and office complex.
Celestion manufactured for some years at Ferry Works and adjacent buildings, producing the &quot;Ditton&quot; range of loudspeakers. British Rola bought Celestion in 1947 and moved production to Thames Ditton a year later. The name of the company changed to Rola Celestion; with its products sold under the brand name &quot;Celestion&quot;. (MPP, later a camera maker, was formed as a subsidiary during the war.)

From its creation in 1933 to its dissolution in 1994 the Milk Marketing Board, a government agency to support milk production and distribution in the United Kingdom, was headquartered at Giggs Hill Green in Thames Ditton. Its large site, already licensed for commercial use, was targeted by Tesco for a supermarket and garage in the early 1990s but local action secured it for a housing development with public tennis courts, a recreational area and two acres for community health purposes.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 18,272. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

==Amenities==
Thames Ditton railway station links Thames Ditton to London Waterloo, serving the large commuter population, local workforce and Esher college student population.

Its High Street is a conservation area that has a mixture of residential housing, office and retail shops in about equal proportion. The village High Street retains a pharmacy, greengrocery, florist, coffee/delicatessen shop, four restaurants (Chinese, Indian, Italian and Thai), sandwich/coffee shops, a photographers and a post-office/convenience store. There are also a hairdressers, estate agents, two gift shops, a silversmith and jewellers, tennis and hockey equipment shop (the latter run by an Olympic gold-medallist), a small modern art gallery, two beauty salons and an undertaker. In nearby Summer Road there is a newsagents, convenience store, dry cleaners and a high end interior designer. There are six pubs in the village, two with riverside frontages. The George and Dragon on the corner of High Street and Station Road hosts Thames Ditton Farmers&#x27; Market every 4 th Saturday of the month from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

At Winters Bridge on the Portsmouth Road there is a small parade of shops that includes a nationally recognised patisserie and chocolatier. There is another off-licence, a pharmacy and newsagent on Thorkhill Road, formerly Workhouse Lane.

The village has a Residents&#x27; Association, which was formed in 1934. The Residents&#x27; Association as at 2012 holds all three seats for the ward on Elmbridge Borough Council, and the Surrey County Council seat for the Dittons.

A small United Reformed Church was added in the 19th century. Giggs Hill Green, and the Vera Fletcher Hall. The Vera Fletcher Hall &quot;The Theatre in Thames Ditton&quot; is on Embercourt Road, near Thames Ditton railway station. The old Victorian Village Hall was built in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee as a gift to the community from local benefactor Hannibal Speer (born Hannibal Sandys) Lord of the Manor of Weston. Over the years the village hall has been able to attract stars such as Petula Clark (who opened the hall), Dorothy Tutin, Denis Quilley, Janet Suzman, John Julius Norwich, Susannah York, the English National Opera and the Royal Shakespeare Company with their &quot;Shakespeare Revue&quot;. Local drama and music groups present performances at the hall on a regular basis.

The Rythe is a small river that bisected the southwest of the old parish in running almost along the Portsmouth Road and turns north near Ferry Road to drain into the Thames at which point it formed the old border with Long Ditton, which had a narrow riverside.

Ye Olde Harrow, an historic inn was a base for the local militia in the days of highwaymen (see above) and subsequently hosted one of the oldest bowling greens in the county. It is to be demolished and several houses are to be built on the site.

==Localities==
Further churches and facilities in the arguably independent, and inchoate locality of Weston Green which is termed by its residents association a &#x27;village&#x27; but retains a strong association with Thames Ditton, with three residential roads indistinct as to at which point along them the boundary between the two lies, while other parts of the former parish of Thames Ditton, such as Hinchley Wood and Claygate, have taken on separate identities, and have become part of the Esher post town. The Giggs Hill area takes its name from Giggs Hill Green.

==Landmarks==

===Boyle Farm===
&lt;br&gt;
Boyle Farm was the earlier name of the Home of Compassion, a wide range mansion care home by the River Thames formerly set among fields rather than private houses. The country house replaced the farmhouse of Forde&#x27;s Farm in 1786 when built by the Honourable Charlotte Boyle Walsingham. Although the estate has been sold and divided into expensive building plots over the past century, some of the farm buildings and outhouses remain. It has river frontage and used to own a small island in the Thames, which the frontage (mooring) overlooks, called Boyle Farm Island. The building is currently a nursing home run by a board of trustees.
===St Nicholas Church===

The ecclesiastical parish church (since the English Reformation, implying Church of England) was built almost wholly in the early medieval period demonstrates fine architecture and is listed in the highest category of building.

===Giggs Hill Green===

This triangular village green adjoins Portsmouth Road and gives its name to a locality of the village marked on some maps, but within any official status such as wards, the main secondary parade of shops of the village is here, which also serves that part of Long Ditton on the riverside part of the Portsmouth Road. There is no hill here and its were purchased in 1901 by the Esher and Dittons Urban District Council for its cricket green and remainder for its park benches and to allow picnics and informal sport.

==Transport links==

===Rail===
Thames Ditton railway station is on the Hampton Court branch line from London Waterloo to Hampton Court. Rail services are provided by South Western Railway. Journey time to London Waterloo is 33 minutes (it is also possible to connect with faster trains at Surbiton). Trains run every half hour from 05:56 to 23:26 to London Waterloo.

===Bus===
Various buses run through Thames Ditton, including the 515 (Mon-Sat, hourly, Kingston-Surbiton-Thames Ditton-Esher-Hersham-Weybridge), 513 (Mon-Fri, twice daily, Kingston-Thames Ditton-Esher-Oxshott-Cobham), 514 (Mon-Sat, twice daily, Kingston-Surbiton-Thames Ditton-East and West Molesey-Fieldcommon-Hersham-Weybridge- Brooklands) and services 458 and 715 which run via the Portsmouth Road to serve Walton, Staines, Cobham and Guildford. The 715 is diverted via Thames Ditton village on Sundays.

===Road===
From Thames Ditton, it is approximately five minutes by road to the A3 (eastbound) or ten minutes to A3 (both ways). It is some 15 minutes to the M3 and M25 and about 35 minutes to Heathrow airport, with typical traffic. Despite the further distance, it can take as little as 45 minutes to reach Gatwick airport. Occasionally, these times may be affected by racing at Kempton Park Racecourse and/or Sandown Park.

==Education==
*Thames Ditton Infant School
*Thames Ditton Junior School
*St Paul&#x27;s RC Primary School

For senior education this is outside of the boundaries but nearby, at Secondary School and Sixth Form College and Esher College.

Preparatory and independent schools (private sector junior to 13 years and at senior levels) are outside of the boundaries but relatively nearby, including one in Weston Green.

==Flooding==
The village was partly hit by the Great Flood of 1968 when the rivers Ember and Mole burst their banks. The extent of the flooding reached from the western points of the Portsmouth Road to the River Thames and caused flood damage to many homes, including some in the west of Weston Green. The floodwaters did not subside for a number of days.

On 30 November 2006, a diameter water pipe, believed to be over 150 years old, burst in a garden near the railway station. This caused flooding in two local streets. The floods reached the Infants&#x27; School grounds and high street, shops and two houses close to the Thames.

==Sports activities==

Thames Ditton Cricket Club is the oldest sports club in Thames Ditton. The first recorded match on Giggs Hill Green was in 1833, and the club remains with hundreds of members and a recently built brand new pavilion. They have three Saturday XI&#x27;s, and one Sunday team. The club celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2008, and in 2009 contracted former West Indies cricket captain Richie Richardson to coach and play for the team for the following four years.

The cricket club has enjoyed success in recent seasons, and in 2019 completed a &quot;treble&quot; of promotions, with the 1st XI (captained by Chris Dixon), the 2nd XI (captained by Amrik Natt) and the 3rd XI (captained by Chris Harding) all achieving promotion for their relevant divisions.
Weston Green Road is the location of Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club (TDLTC). The club was ravaged in the 1990s by a protracted legal battle with the owner of the site freehold, who wished to build executive homes on the site. Though TDLTC eventually won the case, it lost the rights to use three courts on the adjoining Esher College site, which were themselves subsequently sold to developers. However, the club still owns six grass and four hard courts, along with one short tennis court. It also has access to a three new hard courts at Esher College, and a weekend arrangement with Kingston Grammar School to use its courts as an overflow for the junior section.

The Thames Ditton Squash Club is now housed at Colets&#x27; Health and Fitness Club. It is the strongest club in England, with several national club championships to its name as well as a strong record in the European championships. The same fitness club is also the headquarters of a number of rugby and football teams of the Old Paulines (St. Paul&#x27;s School alumni) who own the grounds.

In Weston Green there is the Old Cranleighan Rugby Football Club, as well as the Old Cranleighan Hockey Club. Having been formed in 1919 and 1921 respectively, the OCRFC and the OCHC moved to their new clubhouse in a secluded position off Portsmouth Road in 1928. The clubhouse was substantially renovated and enlarged in 1993 and the club now has some of the best facilities for rugby and hockey in Surrey. OC Rugby started a Mini Rugby section in September 2011, which has been very successful in providing a fun and controlled introduction to rugby for local children on Sunday mornings.
Metropolitan Police F.C. of the Southern Football League are based in Thames Ditton.

Thames Ditton Regatta, founded in 1948, is a rowing regatta which takes place in May on a course which finishes just below the River Mole, opposite Hampton Court Palace.

The traditional river sports of skiffing and punting are possible at Dittons Skiff and Punting Club at the end of Queen&#x27;s Road. The club was formed in 1923 and is involved in various water-based activities including the Great River Race and Thames meanders. It hosts the Hampton Court and Dittons Regatta and has its own annual regatta on the river opposite Hampton Court Palace.

==Cultural references==
;Literature – non-fiction
Charles Lamb in his letter to William Wordsworth of 19 October 1810 writes about the place:
:&quot;A very striking instance of your position might be found in the churchyard of Ditton-upon-Thames, if you know such a place. Ditton-upon-Thames has been blessed by the residence of a poet who, for love or money, I do not well know which, has dignified every gravestone for the last few years with brand new verses, all different and all ingenious, with the author&#x27;s name at the bottom of each. This sweet Swan of Thames has so artfully diversified his strains and his rhymes that the same thought never occurs twice,--more justly, perhaps, as no thought ever occurs at all, there was a physical impossibility that the same thought should recur, It is long since I saw and read these inscriptions; but I remember the impression was of a smug usher at his desk in the intervals of instruction, levelling his pen. Of death, as it consists of dust and worms, and mourners and uncertainty, he had never thought; but the word &quot;death&quot; he had often seen separate and conjunct with other words, till he had learned to speak of all its attributes as glibly as Unitarian Belsham will discuss you the attributes of the word &quot;God&quot; in a pulpit, and will talk of infinity with a tongue that dangles from a skull that never reached in thought and thorough imagination two inches, or farther than from his hand to his mouth, or from the vestry to the sounding-board of the pulpit. But the epitaphs were trim and sprag, and patent, and pleased the survivors of Thames Ditton above the old mumpsimus of &quot;Afflictions sore&quot;.&quot;

;Literature – fiction and verse
In 1834, well after the lock below was built, Theodore Hook composed an ode or tribute, fishing from a punt here:
&lt;poem&gt;
Here, in a placid waking dream
I&#x27;m free from worldly troubles,
Calm as the rippling silver stream
That in the sunshine baubles;

And when sweet Eden&#x27;s blissful bowers
Some abler bard has writ on,
Despairing to transcend his powers,
I&#x27;ll &quot;ditto&quot; say for &quot;Ditton&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

He also wrote verse about The Swan Inn that year.

Eric Wilson Barker (1905–1973), poet, spent his childhood in the village, attended the old church school in Church Walk, then his family emigrated to California for health reasons. Barker became a celebrate and was offered the laureateship of California, which he declined. He revisited his birthplace in 1959 and wrote to a friend: &#x27;I visited an ancient pub, The Old Harrow near Weston Green. I always remember the lines on the signboard of that inn when I was a kid... There it was too and the old weatherworn sign with the letters a bit dim but still legible!&#x27; Barker wrote a poem &quot;IN THAMES DITTON&quot; under &quot;Looking for Water&quot;, published 1964: &quot;In Thames Ditton I remembered a clock...&quot;

Ernest William Hornung penned a very brief local stay of the narrator-protagonist in &quot;The Amateur Cracksman&quot; (1899):
;Literature – biographic main references
Thomas Babington Macaulay rented lodgings a year near Esher railway station (then still &quot;Ditton Marsh&quot;) while writing some of his &quot;History of England&quot;. His nephew and biographer Otto Trevelyan wrote in 1876: &quot;&quot;His brother-in-law had taken a house in the village of Esher; and Macaulay accordingly settled himself, with infinite content, exactly in the middle of the only ugly square mile of country which can be found in that delightful neighbourhood. &#x27;I am pretty well pleased,&#x27; he says, &#x27;with my ... pleasant, small dwelling, surrounded by geraniums and roses... The only complaint I have to make is that the view from my front windows is blocked by a railway embankment.&#x27; Macaulay&#x27;s cottage, which stood in Ditton Marsh, by the side of the high-road from Kingston to Esher, was called Greenwood Lodge.&quot;

;Television
&quot;Monty Python&quot;, regularly poking jibes at adjoining Esher, in the sketch, &#x27;Blackmail&#x27; has a scene in &quot;Thames Ditton&quot; filmed in a west London residential road.

Exterior scenes for the 1980s sitcom &quot;After Henry&quot; were shot on the village High Street.

In Amazon&#x27;s 2019 series &quot;Hanna&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s friend Sophie and her family live in Thames Ditton.

<text>Donald Morison Murray (September 16, 1924December 30, 2006) was an American journalist and English professor. He wrote for many journals, authored several books on the art of writing and teaching, and served as writing coach for several national newspapers. After writing multiple editorials about changes in American military policy for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, he won the 1954 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. For 20 years, he wrote the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;″s &quot;Over 60&quot; column, eventually renamed &quot;Now And Then&quot;. He taught at the University of New Hampshire for 26 years.

== Early life and education ==
Murray was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up nearby in Quincy. He graduated from Tilton School, a college preparatory school in Tilton, New Hampshire. A paratrooper during World War II, he attended the University of New Hampshire, graduating with a degree in English in 1948. He got his start as a copyboy at the Boston Herald and became a staff reporter in 1949. After working briefly for &quot;Time&quot; magazine and as a freelance writer in the 1950s, Murray joined the University of New Hampshire faculty in 1963.

== On writing ==
Murray chronicled his relationship with writing until the day he died. In a column published just before his death, he wrote, &quot;Each time I sit down to write I don&#x27;t know if I can do it. The flow of writing is always a surprise and a challenge. Click the computer on and I am 17 again, wanting to write and not knowing if I can&quot;. His final column was published in the Boston Globe five days before his death.

Throughout his book, &quot;Crafting a Life,&quot; Murray demonstrates his writing process and provides guidelines for readers developing their own writing. He notes authors who have provided inspiration for his personal writing like Graham Greene and George Orwell. Orwell&#x27;s essay Why I Write is especially apparent in Murray&#x27;s motivation to write. When considering how to begin his own writing, Murray said, &quot;I remembered them as being unexpected but true to what happens in the essay&quot;. In &quot;Crafting a Life&quot;, he lists and explains his manifesto:
I write to say I am, discover who I am, create life, understand my life, slay my dragons, exercise my craft, lose myself in my work, for revenge, to share, to testify, to avoid boredom, and to celebrate. Murray compared a writer&#x27;s voice in language to music and deemed its significance as the key factor in capturing an audience. In addressing the complexities of voice in writing, Murray noted the following elements as important to developing a writer&#x27;s voice: revealing specifics, the word, the phrase, the beat, and the point of view.
He encourages writers to write with their readers as new stories are composed. To demonstrate this, he provides examples of his own writing and along with that, writes what the reader might think or say in response. He then discusses, briefly, researching certain topics to strengthen the ethos of the writer.

Murray encouraged the writer to embrace and not fear self-exposure. &quot;In effective writing and, especially in personal-essay writing, the author exposes himself or herself, revealing thoughts and feelings that the reader had also experienced but may have denied…and that is the strength of many essays. It is, however, a problem for the writer who is usually uncomfortable about this exposure&quot;.

== Style and approach to writing ==
Murray&#x27;s approach to writing relies on the concept of unfinished writing. Murray believes writing should be a process, not just a product, therefore it should never be finished. This approach involves teachers allowing their students to be in the driver&#x27;s seat during the writing process; the student discovers where they want the paper to go before the teacher begins to correct or edit any writing. In this approach, the student explores their writing as a process that is constantly growing and never quite finished, empowering them to become more independent writers.
Murray preaches the importance of discovery in writing to learn more about the world around you. Murray also advised &quot;to be patient, and wait and wait and wait&quot;.
Many have called Murray&#x27;s approach to writing &quot;writing-as-problem-solving&quot;. 

Murray’s theory of the writing process requires thoughtful, recursive revision. In 1981, he wrote that revision “is not just clarifying meaning, it is discovering meaning and clarifying it while it is being discovered.” To achieve these ends, Murray argued that the writer must “go back again and again and again to consider what the writing means and if the writer can accept, document, and communicate that meaning. In other words, writing is not what the writer does after the thinking is done; writing is thinking.” Murray also believed it was essential that students care about their academic writing, to ensure their writing would be meaningful. he also implored teachers to allow their students to write about topics other than literature, as he understood that students were more likely to be invested in their writing if they were allowed to choose topics of great importance to them.

Murray believed that each editor should have his own checklist for revision. His check list involved reading for three things: focus, form and voice. 

== Teaching ==
As a proponent of process theory in composition studies, Murray is credited for applying this theory in the classroom. He advised teachers, when teaching writing, to &quot;be quiet, to listen, to respond&quot;. Murray advised teachers to avoid making editing corrections in early drafts as meaning is not always discovered by the writer in the first draft. Instead, he called on teachers to provide time to students for revising multiple drafts and promote revision as a natural occurrence as opposed to a tedious task or punishment. In the time allowed for multiple drafts, teachers employ Murray&#x27;s idea of teaching &quot;unfinished writing&quot;, where teachers can encourage students to feel excited about discovering their writing and focus on the meaning of their writing, rather than teachers focusing what is right and wrong in their students&#x27; writing. 

While Murray&#x27;s teaching strategies were especially popular in the late 20th century, his perspective on the writing process is found in the contemporary classroom for both secondary and postsecondary composition.

== Criticism ==
Because Murray emphasized the importance of the individual writer, composition theorists including James Berlin contended that he neglected the social aspect of writing. Post-process theorists also saw Murray and other proponents of process theory as enabling prescribed rules that limited the writer&#x27;s ability to explore through writing and harked back to Current Traditional Rhetoric. Thomas Stewart also spoke to Murray&#x27;s insistence on writing in solitude, and argued Murray&#x27;s &quot;complicated aloneness&quot; strongly influenced his writing pedagogy.

==Personal life==

Murray&#x27;s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1951, he married Minnie Mae Emmerich Murray and his wife had three children, Anne, Hannah, and Lee. Daughter Lee died at 20 years of age and Murray later wrote about the experience in &quot;The Lively Shadow: Living with the Death of a Child&quot;.

Murray died in December 2006 from heart failure in Durham, New Hampshire at the age of 82. He donated over 100 of his writing journals — or, as he called them, &quot;daybooks&quot; — to the Poynter Institute, a non-profit school for journalism with which he had long been associated.

<doc id="1183423" wikidata="Q4986248" url="?curid=1183423" title="Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips">
<text>Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips is a 1944 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon, released on April 22, 1944, features Bugs Bunny. The film depicts Bugs fighting against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Pacific War. The film is considered controversial for caricaturing the Japanese enemy, and expressing anti-Japanese sentiment.

==Plot==
Somewhere in the Pacific, Bugs is floating in a box, singing to himself, when &quot;the island that inevitably turns up in this kind of picture&quot; turns up. Bugs swims towards it, admiring the peace and quiet, when bombs start going off (&quot;The Storm&quot; from the &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; is also heard in the background). Bugs ducks into a haystack, and soon comes face-to-face with a Japanese soldier: a short, bespectacled, buck-toothed, bare-footed, slant-eyed Japanese man who pronounces &quot;L&quot; as &quot;R&quot;, and who might be rapidly stating the names of Japanese cities whenever he moves. The soldier chases Bugs into a rabbit hole, where the soldier dumps a bomb inside. However, Bugs manages to blow up the soldier with the bomb. When the soldier tries to swing a sword at Bugs, Bugs appears as a Japanese general (presumably Hideki Tojo), but is soon recognized by his trademark carrot-eating, prompting the soldier (who says that he had seen Bugs in the &quot;Warner Bros. Leon Schlesinger &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon pictures&quot;, referring to the fact that Bugs was originally exclusive to that series) to ask him, &quot;What&#x27;s up, Honorable Doc?&quot;

Bugs then jumps into a plane (which looks like a Mitsubishi A6M Zero); the soldier also jumps into a plane (also looks like a Zero). However, Bugs ties the soldier&#x27;s plane to a tree, causing the plane to be yanked out from under him. The soldier parachutes down, but is met in mid-air by Bugs, who hands &quot;Moto&quot; (cf. Mr. Moto) some &quot;scrap iron&quot; (an anvil), causing the soldier to fall. Painting a Japanese flag on a tree to denote one soldier down, Bugs runs into a sumo wrestler, against whom he confidently faces off (cockily marking a second and bigger flag on the tree). After being temporarily beaten by the sumo wrestler (and, to be fair, wiping the second mark off the tree before collapsing), Bugs dresses as a geisha and knocks out the wrestler, who repaints the second flag on the tree before passing out.

Seeing a group of Japanese landing craft making their way toward the island (and exclaiming &quot;Japs! Hundreds of &#x27;em!&quot;), Bugs thinks of a plan to get rid of them all. He comes out in a &quot;Good Rumor&quot; (a parody of Good Humor) truck, which plays Mozart (&quot;Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja&quot; from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;), and hands each of the Japanese an ice-cream bar with a grenade inside it, calling them racist slurs such as &quot;monkey-face&quot; and &quot;slant-eyes&quot; whilst doing so. All of the Japanese are killed by the explosions, save one, who is killed after redeeming a &#x27;free&#x27; ice-cream bar from Bugs. Having now painted dozens of Japanese flags on the trees, denoting all the downed enemy forces, Bugs comments again about the &quot;peace and quiet – and if there&#x27;s one thing I CAN&#x27;T stand, it&#x27;s peace and quiet!.&quot;

Then Bugs spots an American battleship (presumed to be the USS &quot;Iowa&quot;) in the distance and raises a white flag, yelling for them to come get him, but they keep going. Bugs is insulted. &quot;Do they think I want to spend the rest of my life on this island?&quot; With this remark, a female rabbit (dressed in a Hawaiian outfit, possibly a caricature of Dorothy Lamour) appears, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a possibility!&quot; Bugs pulls down the distress flag, lets out a wolf-cry and goes running after her.

==Analysis==
The films depicting the Japanese enemy during World War II tended both to identify a formidable wartime adversary and to depict the adversary as inferior to his American counterparts. In cartoons, this translated to a tendency to depict the Japanese as either superman or buffoon. This film more closely represents the latter tendency. The caricature portrayal of this film serves as a host to well-worn stereotypes.

The film opens with Bugs singing from within a crate. He is somewhere in the Pacific and is waiting for the inevitable island to turn up. He then sees an island and swims towards its beach. Already in the introduction, Bugs identifies his Pacific island setting as a &quot;garden of Eden&quot; and a &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, the latter of which is in reference to the exotic havens depicted in South Sea island films and to the epic film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937). Only then is Bugs alerted to the mortal danger that awaits him on the island. The seductive first impression serves to set up a hazardous trap.

Bugs escapes rapid gunfire by running for cover into a haystack. The initial encounter of Bugs with a Japanese soldier presents an optical illusion, that the two share a body. Bugs&#x27; head peeks above the haystack, while the legs of the soldier appear below it. Then the owner of the feet confronts Bugs. The soldier has buck teeth, a thin mustache, dark eyeglasses, slanted eyebrows and curly, wavy hair.

The soldier pulls out a sword and starts swiping at Bugs. He speaks in Oriental-sounding gibberish, consisting of short syllables spoken in a staccato voice. In response, Bugs assumes the form of a Japanese general and stands stiffly at attention. Bugs&#x27; face is briefly transformed into a Japanese caricature, only to be contrasted with the face of an actual, if impish, Japanese soldier. Bugs disguised as a general imitates photographs of Hideki Tojo. The soldier bows in supplication to the authority figure. Bugs accidentally gives away his identity by casually chewing on a carrot.

The soldier resumes use of his sword and talks gibberish again. Bugs takes off in a Japanese plane, followed by the soldier in his own plane. Both planes are presumably based on the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Bugs ties the rival plane to a tree. The soldier parachutes out and Bugs hands him an anvil. Mocking: &quot;Here&#x27;s some scrap iron for Japan, Moto.&quot; There is a spoken reference to Mr. Moto to provide a well-acquainted name to the wartime enemy.

Bugs then bumps into a sumo wrestler. The man is huge with a large stomach, a mustache, a goatee, buck teeth with a large gap between the front teeth, and a Mohawk/queue hairstyle. In response, Bugs transforms into a geisha. He speaks in Japanese-sounding gibberish and coaxes the wrestler into a near kiss. The kiss turns into a fatal blow with a mallet. Bugs triumphantly shouts &quot;timber&quot; as the man falls. The masquerade scene involving the wrestler and the geisha makes use of two relatively harmless civilian-type characters to cast the enemy in a humorous light. In concept, it suggests that an Oriental guise can be put on and discarded at will.

Bugs then sees several Japanese ships floating towards the island. He is next seen disguised as an ice cream truck vendor in the mold of the Good Humor man. He entices many Japanese soldiers to come get their ice cream. There are many Japanese soldiers besieging Bugs&#x27; ice cream truck. Suggesting that their threat relies on their numbers. They are an easily fooled mob, not a group of individuals. They resemble a swarm of bees and they are rendered less as human figures and more like a scourge in need of extermination.

Bugs insults his customers by calling them &quot;monkey face&quot; and &quot;slant eyes&quot;. The scene with the ice cream track partially obscures the faces and bodies of the enemy soldiers, but Bugs verbalizes a physical description. The phrases &quot;bowlegs&quot;, &quot;monkey face&quot;, &quot;slant eyes&quot; both serve as racial epithets and audibly support the visualized stereotypes of the film. They are all elements of the Japanese wartime caricature.

They get served with chocolate-covered ice cream bars embedded with grenades. The soldiers run off as soon as they get served. Then numerous explosions are heard. One battered soldier returns to present his specially-marked stick, earning him a free ice cream bar. He is the last one. Bugs&#x27; mission is accomplished. He then signals an American ship to come get him.

Bugs hates being confined to a world of &quot;peace and quiet&quot;. He celebrates the approach of an American ship and his potential rescue, until he meets a sarong-clad female bunny. The female bunny ignites his passion. He howls and thumps his foot, his eyes bulging from their sockets. He leaps into an amorous pursuit and the film ends.

The short placed an emphasis on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might. The Japanese are distinctively othered as physically deformed. The Japanese are characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of the Japanese as both gullible and greedy. Bugs&#x27; stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.

The short has similarities to both &quot;Wackiki Wabbit&quot; (1943) and &quot;Herr Meets Hare&quot; (1945). The soundtrack includes &quot;Trade Winds&quot; and &quot;Someone&#x27;s Rocking My Dreamboat&quot;. There are two musical quotations from &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (1870) by Richard Wagner. The Japanese soldiers are repeatedly presented on screen to the tune of the &quot;Kimigayo&quot; (1870). The ice cream truck scene uses the tune of the opening aria of Papageno, from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1791) by Mozart. When Bugs professes his hatred of the peace and quiet, demanding someone to get him out of this place, the tune is the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;.

Neil Lerner attempts to decipher Carl Stalling&#x27;s intentions in quoting Wagner at the end of the battle scenes. He suggests that it is connected to the role of the Valkyries, taking fallen warriors to Valhalla. In this case, the use is ironic as Stalling would not view the deceased Japanese soldiers as fallen heroes who deserve an afterlife paradise.

As Bugs signals the American ship, the tune is from the scene where Brünnhilde announces her pregnancy. Lerner suggests that Stalling was inspired by the name of Siegfried, &quot;peace through victory&quot;. Stalling could intend the scene to represent the United States reaching such a peace. Alternatively, he might be inspired by the stark isolation of Brünnhilde on a rocky mountain – in which case, the reference would have been Bugs being trapped on the island.

==Reception==
*The &quot;Film Daily&quot; called the eight-minute short &quot;good fun&quot; and gave the following synopsis:

&quot;Bugs Bunny, cast away on a Pacific isle, thinks the setting ideal until he finds his paradise infested with Japanese soldiers. How he single-handedly exterminates the enemy makes for a laugh-filled few minutes of typical Bugs antics, off-screen remarks and action in this Technicolor cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger.&quot;
==Notes==
Since the 1960s, &quot;Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips&quot; has been controversial because of its racial stereotyping. However, the cartoon was not one of the &quot;Censored Eleven&quot; and was occasionally shown on television in syndicated packages with other pre-August 1948 Warner Bros. cartoons whose copyrights were under the ownership of Associated Artists Productions. The short debuted on home video in December 1991 on the first volume of &quot;Golden Age of Looney Tunes&quot; laser disc collection. The niche market format did not cause a stir, but when the 5-disc set was later issued in the more accessible VHS format on 10 separate tapes in 1993, Japanese groups went against its distribution. Originally, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (the copyright owners of the Turner/Associated Artists Productions shorts at the time) defended itself against the Japanese groups and did not withdraw the release , but later both releases were withdrawn. Future releases for both formats replaced the cartoon with &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot;, which already appeared on another LaserDisc and VHS set. The VHS reissue combined volumes 4 and 7 of the 10-tape set. After the pulling of the short in 1993 from home video, the short was also pulled from American television networks and has been since.

This was one of the 12 Bugs Bunny cartoons that were pulled out of Cartoon Network&#x27;s June Bugs 2001 marathon by order of AOL Time Warner due to stereotypes of Japanese people. However, in a promo for this event, the scene where Bugs does a double-take on noticing the female rabbit was used. This cartoon was shown, albeit in clips, on a special episode of the Cartoon Network show &quot;ToonHeads&quot; about cartoons from the World War II era, while a voiceover explained how Japanese stereotypes in World War II cartoons tended to be very cruel (as shown in Norm MacCabe&#x27;s &quot;Tokio Jokio&quot;, this cartoon and clips of World War II-era Popeye cartoons).

<doc id="1183435" wikidata="Q452397" url="?curid=1183435" title="Friedrich von Amerling">
<text>Friedrich von Amerling (14 April 1803 – 14 January 1887) was an Austro-Hungarian portrait painter in the court of Franz Josef. He was born in Vienna and was court painter between 1835 and 1880. With Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, he is one of the outstanding Austrian portrait painters of the 19th century.

==Biography==
He was the son of the gold- and silversmith Franz Amerling and Theresia Kargl. He studied from 1815 to 1824 at the academy of the arts in Vienna, before journeying to Prague where he studied at the Academy until 1826. He spent 1827 and 1828 in London, where he was influenced by the portrait painter Thomas Lawrence. Further journeys led him to Paris, where he studied with Horace Vernet, and Rome; he then returned to Vienna, where after 1828 he worked for the Austrian court, the aristocracy and middle class. He received the Reichel prize of the academy in Vienna in 1829.

Amerling spent much time traveling: in 1836 and 1838 to Italy, 1838 to the Netherlands, 1839 to Munich, 1840-43 in Rome, 1882 in Spain, 1883 in England, 1884 in Greece, 1885 in Scandinavia up to Norway&#x27;s North Cape and 1886 to Egypt and Palestine. He was married four times: to Antonie Kaltenthaler from 1832 until her death in 1843; from 1844–45 to Katharina Heissler (ending in divorce); from 1857 until her death in 1880 with Emilie Heinrich; and finally to Maria Nemetschke from 1881 until his death.

In 1878 Amerling was elevated to the nobility and was called Friedrich Ritter von Amerling. As one of the most outstanding artists of Vienna he received numerous important men of letters and musicians (such as Franz Liszt) at home. In 1858 he acquired the Gumpendorf castle in Vienna and equipped it after his taste with valuable art treasures. The building was therefore called, in the vernacular, &quot;Amerlingschloessl&quot;.

==Honors==
Apart from numerous other honours, he received the Orden der Eisernen Krone in 1879. Upon his death in 1887, a street in Vienna was designated the Amerlingstrasse in his name. He was buried in the Viennese central cemetery, where he is commemorated with a monument designed by Johannes Benk. The same artist also created the Amerling monument in the Viennese city park, dedicated in 1902.

In 1948 the Austrian post office issued a special stamp on the 60th anniversary of Friedrich von Amerling&#x27;s death. On 3 March 2008 the Österreichische Post issued another Amerling stamp. This time it was one of a series commemorating the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna and featured Princess Marie Franziska of Liechtenstein.

==Works==
Amerling created over 1000 works, mostly portraits. He was the most popular portrait painter of the high aristocracy and the large middle class of the Biedermeier period. The years from 1830 to 1850 represent the high point of his work. His style has points of similarity to that of Ingres, combining clarity of outline with rich coloration.
Amerling&#x27;s work was exhibited in Vienna in 2003. Most of his work remains in Austria.

<doc id="1183445" wikidata="Q2492235" url="?curid=1183445" title="Sewsunker Sewgolum">
<text>Sewsunker &quot;Papwa&quot; Sewgolum (OIS) (12 December 1928 – 5 July 1978) was a South African professional golfer of ethnic Indian origin, who carved a niche for himself in golfing folklore when he became the first golfer of colour to win a provincial open in South Africa. He became a symbol of the sports boycott movement when pictures of him receiving his trophy outdoors in the rain were published across the world: due to apartheid, he was not allowed to enter the clubhouse.

==Professional career==
Sewgolum began his career as a caddie. Sewgolum was a caddie for amateur golfer Graham Wulff. Impressed by Sewgolum&#x27;s great talents, Wulff arranged for him to try to qualify for the 1959 Open Championship and participate in the Dutch Open that summer. Sewgolum qualified for the Open Championship when he shot a 71 and won the Dutch Open. He would go on to successfully defend his championship the following year. He was noted for his unconventional grip, holding the club with his right hand above the left.

In 1961, Sewgolum was the first non-white to take part in the South African Open. Just two years after he broke the color barrier he finished second, losing by one shot to Afrikaner Retief Waltman.

Later in 1963, he caused a stir when he beat 103 white golfers, including Harold Henning, at the Natal Open. He was the first non-white person to win an event on the South Africa circuit. He also performed admirably later in the summer at the 1963 Open Championship, shooting 71-74-73-72 to finish in solo 13th. Among the many South African golfers at the event, Gary Player was the only one to score better than Sewgolum, beating him by three shots. It was Sewgolum&#x27;s best ever finish in a major. The next year he won the Dutch Open for the third and final time. He also won the 1964 Cock of the North, an event in Zambia.

In 1965, he won the Natal Open for the second time, defeating runner-up Gary Player. Even more famous than his victory, however, was the trophy presentation. Sewgolum was forced to accept the trophy outside of Durban Country Club in the rain. Colored and black people were not allowed in the clubhouse, otherwise the club could lose its liquor license. Sewgolum&#x27;s performance received worldwide attention and was covered by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He would return to defend his championship in February 1966 but would finish in fourth place with a score of 292, six behind Player. The following year, in 1967, Sewgolum would nearly win the Dutch Open for the fourth time, finishing two behind England&#x27;s Peter Townsend.

In addition to his achievements in mainstream events, Sewgolum was also the winner of a number of non-white golfing championships in South Africa. His success embarrassed the apartheid government, however, and he was ultimately banned from playing golf or even entering a golf course as a spectator.

== Personal life ==
Sewgolum had five children with his wife, Suminthra. He would die impoverished in 1978 at the age of 49.

== Legacy ==
A number of books and films have been created based on his legacy. They include the 2005 film &quot;Papwa: The Lost Dream of a South African Golfing Legend&quot;. A decade later, the biography &quot;Papwa: Golf&#x27;s Lost Legend&quot; was published. It was written by Maxine Case.

<text>Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Clark (born 28 October 1956) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who is currently manager of Scottish Lowland Football League club Albion Rovers.

==Career==
Clark played for several clubs in his playing career including his home town club Airdrieonians, Rangers, Heart of Midlothian (Hearts) and West Ham United. His longest and most successful spells were those at Tynecastle and Broomfield. In 1982, Clark won the Scottish PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award. In 1984, Clark went on to win the Scottish League Cup final with Rangers in a 3–2 victory over Celtic.

He has managed several clubs, including Partick Thistle, Hamilton Academical, Hearts (twice, once as caretaker), St Johnstone and Berwick Rangers.

His work with BBC Scotland previously included TV commentary, where he was the regular summariser to main commentator Rob MacLean.

In 2005, Clark was appointed as a striker coach at Aberdeen. He left the club in May 2009, along with manager Jimmy Calderwood and assistant Jimmy Nicholl. In January 2010 he joined Kilmarnock as first team coach, working under the same management team until the end of the 2009–10 season. Clark was a sports performance lecturer at Cumbernauld College after leaving Kilmarnock.

Clark was appointed Queen of the South&#x27;s assistant manager to Allan Johnston on 14 May 2012. Johnston and Clark signed a one-year contract extension on 13 April 2013, but then moved onto Kilmarnock as that club&#x27;s new management team in June 2013. Clark left Kilmarnock in May 2014 and was appointed assistant manager to Darren Young at Albion Rovers in June 2014. At the end of the 2014–15 season, Clark departed Albion Rovers and was once again re-united with Allan Johnston, this time as assistant manager of Scottish Championship club Dunfermline Athletic. Johnston and Clark departed the &quot;Pars&quot; during January 2019 and returned to Dumfries club Queens for a second spell on 5 May 2019, after the departure of Gary Naysmith. Johnston and Clark joined on a two-year contract and their first game in-charge came in the Scottish Championship play-off first-leg versus Montrose. On 16 April 2021, Johnston and Clark signed a contract extension to remain the Doonhamers management team until May 2023. On 13 February 2022, Johnston and Clark departed the Doonhamers by mutual consent &quot;(4 wins in 24 matches)&quot; as the Dumfries club languished in the automatic relegation place in the Scottish Championship.

On 25 November 2022, Clark was appointed manager of Lowland League side East Stirlingshire. This was to be Clark&#x27;s first managerial position since he departed Berwick Rangers in 2005.

On 28 March 2023, Clark would leave East Stirlingshire and was named the new manager of Scottish League Two club Albion Rovers.

<text>Colonel Mark Sever Bell, (15 May 1843 – 26 June 1906) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in the Australian colony of New South Wales, his family travelled to England when he was an infant.

He was educated at King&#x27;s College School and King&#x27;s College London, where he was made a Fellow in 1890.

Bell was 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First Ashanti Expedition when the following deed took place on 4 February 1874 at the Battle of Ordashu, Ashanti (now Ghana) for which he was awarded the VC: 
He later achieved the rank of colonel. While serving as the commanding officer of Shornecliff military barracks at Folkestone Kent in 1890 a curious incident involving Colonel Bell occurred making national news. The colonel had been expecting 11 packages by mail wagon but the postman counted 12 addressed to the recipient. While driving his horse and cart up Sandgate hill, a pothole in the road jolted the vehicle and its contents which fell onto the street with the 12th package spilling open. It was revealed to be a stone pickle jar in which was found the dead body of a male infant whose chest had been mutilated and top of the skull removed. The colonel denied any knowledge of who the package had been sent by and policemen managed traced the sender of the package back to a fashionable West-End London address. The property was owned by a wealthy young lady who claimed that the parcel may have been sent by her brother, a doctor and pathologist, who had died three years earlier and who supposedly kept human specimens. However, it appears that the young lady may have either perverted the course of justice or had been let off her crime due to her social status and class.

He died at Windlesham and is buried at All Soul&#x27;s Churchyard, South Ascot, Berkshire, England. A headstone marks his grave.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, England.

<doc id="1183459" wikidata="Q74323" url="?curid=1183459" title="Islam in Thailand">
<text>Islam is a minority faith in Thailand, with statistics in 2006, suggesting 4.9% of the population are Muslim. Figures as high as 5% of Thailand&#x27;s population have also been mentioned. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey gave 7%. Thai Muslims are the largest religious minority in the country. As of 2024, there are approximately 7.5 million Thai Muslims in the Kingdom or about 12% of the total 62.5 million Thai populations.

Most Thai Muslims are Sunni Muslims, although Thailand has a diverse population that includes immigrants from around the world.

==Demographics and geography==
Popular opinion seems to hold that a vast majority of the country&#x27;s Muslims are found in Thailand&#x27;s four southernmost provinces of Satun, Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat, where they make up majority of the population. However, the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; research indicates that only 18 percent of Thai Muslims live in those four provinces. There are also significant minority of Muslims in other southern provinces such as Songkhla, Krabi, Trang, Phatthalung and Phuket. In Bangkok, large Muslim populations are found in districts such as Nong Chok, Min Buri and Bang Rak.

According to the National Statistics Office, in 2015 census, Muslims in Southern Thailand made up 24 percent of the total population, while less than three percent in other parts of the country.

==History==

Muslim merchant communities resided in Thailand as early as the 9th century.

In early modern Thailand, Muslims from the Coromandel Coast served as eunuchs in the Thai palace and court. Thailand, as Siam, was known for religious tolerance, and there were Muslims working for the Siamese Royal Governments throughout the eras. This culture of tolerance in Siam and later Thailand resulted in the great diversity of Islam in Thailand.

Malay separatism in South Thailand is mostly a war based on ethnicity, as Malays in the region have sought to separate from Thailand, although extremist Muslim groups are involved in the conflict.

==Ethnicity and identity==
Thailand&#x27;s Muslim population is diverse, with ethnic groups having migrated from as far as China, Pakistan, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as well as including ethnic Thais, while about two-thirds of Muslims in Thailand are Thai Malays.

===Thai Muslims===
Many Thai Muslims are ethnically and linguistically Thai, who are either hereditary Muslims, Muslims by intermarriage, or recent converts to the faith. Ethnic Thai Muslims live mainly in the central and southern provinces - varying from entire Muslim communities to mixed settlements.

Former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army General Sonthi Boonyaratglin is an example of an indigenous Thai Muslim. Sonthi is of remote Persian ancestry. His ancestor, Sheikh Ahmad of Qom, was an Iranian expatriate trader who lived in the Ayutthaya Kingdom for 26 years. Many Thais, including those of the Bunnag and Ahmadchula families trace their ancestry back to him. Sri Sulalai was a princess of the royal family of the Sultanate of Singora. Rama II of Siam took her as a concubine.

In 1946 Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej and Ananda Mahidol, Rama VIII, toured the Tonson Mosque.

===Malay Muslims===
In the three southernmost border provinces, the vast majority of the local Muslim population is predominantly Malay, amounting to about 80 percent of the region&#x27;s population. Thai Malays speak Kelantan-Pattani Malay, which is different from the Malay language.

The high number of Malay origin inhabitants in the southern region is due to the historical nature of the area, which contains parts of the Patani Kingdom, an Islamic Malay kingdom established in the 19th century, but later annexed to Siam since the early Ayutthaya Kingdom. Similarly, there is an ethnic Thai minority in northern Malaysia.

===Chinese Muslims===

In the far north, as well as in select central and southern urban areas, there are pockets of Thai Muslims of Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslim) origin. Most Chinese Muslims belong to a group of people called Chin Haw in Thai, although most Chin Haw are not Muslims. Some historians believe that the name Chin Haw can be explained to be a combination of &quot;Chin&quot; (China) and &quot;Ho&quot; (Hui). The Chin Haw thus can be seen as traders and émigrés who carried with them Hui traditions from China. One of the best known Chinese mosques is Ban Ho Mosque in Chiang Mai Province.
===Cham Muslims===

Most of the Cham people live in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, also on the coast near the border with Cambodia, and a small part in southern Thailand near Malaysia where they have assimilated with local Thai Malays. Like most Chams in Cambodia, they follow Sunni Islam. They trace their origins to the fall of the Champa city-state in central and southern Vietnam and later fled to the Kingdom of Ayutthaya in the 15th to 16th centuries and the 19th century. Also recent migration in the 1970s following the fall of the Cambodian government to the Khmer Rouge by Pol Pot and the subsequent Cambodian genocide.

===Burmese Muslims===
Ethnic groups including the Rohingya are found in Thailand&#x27;s refugee camps, rural fishing villages, as well as in many small towns and cities close to the Myanmar border.

As well as being home to many Chinese Muslims, Northern Thailand is home to many Burmese and mixed Chinese-Burmese or Pakistani-Burmese peoples. The Burmese Muslim community lives along the border of Thailand with Myanmar and are known as &#x27;Bamroon&#x27; who speak the Burmese language.

===Other Asian Muslim groups===
Other represented groups include Muslim Chams, originally from Vietnam since 15th century, who can be found between the mutual border and Bangkok as well as the deep south. In the 1700s and 1800s Vietnam and Cambodia-based Chams settled in Bangkok.

Other groups include West Asians such as Arabs and South Asians (especially Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis) and Indonesian Muslims, especially Bugis, Javanese and Minangkabau.

According to a 1685 account of a Persian diplomat as well as notes of the French traveller Guy Tachard, there was a substantial Persian Shi&#x27;i community in Thailand at the time, with ritual &quot;ta&#x27;zieh&quot; performances subsidised by the king. There are Muslims of Persian origin that reside in the Bangkok area.

==Distinctiveness of Thai Islam==

Generally believers of the Islamic faith in Thailand follow certain customs and traditions associated with traditional Islam influenced by Sufism.

For Thai Muslims, like their co-religionists in Southeast Asia&#x27;s other Buddhist-majority countries, Mawlid is a symbolic reminder of the historical presence of Islam in the country. It also represents an annual opportunity to reaffirm Muslims&#x27; status as Thai citizens and their allegiance to the monarchy.

The Islamic faith in Thailand, often reflects Sufi beliefs and practices, as in other Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia. The Ministry of Culture&#x27;s Islamic Department gives awards to Muslims who have contributed to the promotion and development of Thai life in their roles as citizens, as educators and as social workers. In Bangkok, the Ngarn Mawlid Klang main festival is a vibrant showcase for the Thai Muslim community and their lifestyles.

==Places of worship==

According to the National Statistics Office of Thailand in 2007, the country had 3494 mosques, with the largest number, 636, in Pattani Province. According to the Religious Affairs Department (RAD), 99 percent of the mosques are associated with Sunni Islam with the remaining one percent Shi&#x27;i Islam.

==Governance and education==
&quot;Chularatchamontri&quot; (จุฬาราชมนตรี) is the title of Shaykh al-Islām (Head of Islam) in Thailand. The title was first used in the Ayutthaya Kingdom when King Songtham (1611–1628) appointed Sheikh Ahmad to the office. Pursuant to the current Islamic Organ Administration Act, BE 2540 (1997), the &quot;Chularatchamontri&quot; is appointed by the King upon advice of the Prime Minister. He has the authority to administer all Islamic affairs in the nation and to provide advice on Islamic affairs to governmental agencies. The &quot;Chularatchamontri&quot; vacates his office at his death, resignation, or removal by the King on the advice of the Prime Minister. Islamic law is implemented in the four southern provinces with Muslim majorities, where it applies only to Muslims in cases concerning the family and inheritance.

Under and headed by the &quot;Chularatchamontri&quot; is the Central Islamic Council of Thailand (คณะกรรมการกลางอิสลามแห่งประเทศไทย) (CICOT) (กอท.), consisting of at least five councillors appointed by the King. The CICOT advises the Minister of Education and the Minister of Interior on Islamic matters. Provincial Islamic Councils (คณะกรรมการอิสลามประจำจังหวัด) exist in provinces with substantial Muslim minorities. There are other links between the government and the Muslim community, including funding for Islamic educational institutions, the construction of larger mosques, and aid to Thai Muslims on pilgrimage to Mecca, with Bangkok and Hat Yai being key gateways.

Thailand maintains several hundred Islamic schools at the primary and secondary levels, as well as Islamic banks such as the Islamic Bank of Thailand, shops, and other institutions. Much of packaged food in the country is also tested and certified halal if applicable.

<text>Eugene Paul Bennett VC MC (4 June 1892 – 6 April 1970) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Cainscross, Stroud, Gloucestershire, one of six children of Charles and Florence Bennett. Bennett was a pupil of Marling School from 1905 to 1908 having gained a scholarship from Uplands School, Stroud.

After leaving school, he worked at the Bank of England and joined the Artists Rifles, Territorial Force, as a private. After the outbreak of the First World War, in October 1914 he went with his regiment to France. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the The Worcestershire Regiment in December 1914, he was awarded the Military Cross in January 1916 for service during Battle of Loos the previous autumn.

Bennett was a 24 years old Temporary Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Worcestershire Regiment, during the First World War when on 5 November 1916 near Le Transloy France the deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

The award citation published in the London Gazette reads:
He later achieved the rank of captain. After the war he became a barrister, being called to the bar in 1923, then practicing as Prosecuting Counsel from 1931 to 1935. From 1935 he served as a Metropolitan Magistrate until his retirement in 1961. During World War II he served as an officer in the Air Training Corps of the RAF. He retired to Vicenza, in northern Italy, where he died in April 1970 at the age of 77 and was cremated.

His VC was presented to Bennett by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 5 February 1917. It is now held by the Worcestershire Regiment collection in the Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum in Worcester, England.

<doc id="1183468" wikidata="Q927544" url="?curid=1183468" title="Fallopia">
<text>Fallopia is a genus of about 12 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat family, often included in a wider treatment of the related genus &quot;Polygonum&quot; in the past, and previously including &quot;Reynoutria&quot;. The genus is native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but species have been introduced elsewhere. The genus includes species forming vines and shrubs.

==Description==
Species of &quot;Fallopia&quot; grow as vines, lianas, shrubs or subshrubs. Unlike species of the related genus &quot;Duma&quot;, they do not have thornlike tips to their branches. Nectaries are present outside the flowers (extrafloral). Plants usually have bisexual flowers. More rarely they may be dioecious, each plant only having flowers with either functional stamens or a functional pistil. The flowers are arranged in a raceme. The tepals of the flowers are dry and paper-like when mature. The flowers have short styles with partially fused stigmas forming a &quot;head&quot;. The fruits are achenes with three sharp edges.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Fallopia&quot; was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763. He distinguished it from &quot;Polygonum&quot; and other genera he placed in his family &quot;Persicariae&quot;. Adanson did not explain the origin of the name. It is said to be named after the Italian botanist Gabriele Falloppio, known as Fallopius in Latin. He was the superintendent of the botanical garden at Padua and an acclaimed anatomist, being considered a founder of modern anatomy.

The status of the genus has varied considerably over time, and its taxonomic history is complicated. For example, Meissner in 1856 placed both Adanson&#x27;s &quot;Fallopia&quot; and the genus &quot;Reynoutria&quot; in a broadly defined &quot;Polygonum&quot;, as did Bentham and Hooker in 1880. When the genus &quot;Fallopia&quot; was recognized, as was generally the case from the 1970s onwards, &quot;Reynoutria&quot; was sometimes included and sometimes not. Thus the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; in 2005 included &quot;Reynoutria&quot; in &quot;Fallopia&quot;, whereas the &quot;Flora of China&quot; in 2003 separated the two genera. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed the separation of &quot;Fallopia&quot; from other related genera.

===Classification and phylogeny===
&quot;Fallopia&quot; is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera &quot;Reynoutria&quot; and &quot;Muehlenbeckia&quot;, forming the so-called &quot;RMF clade&quot;.
===Species===
, Plants of the World Online accepted 12 species.
*&quot;Fallopia aubertii&quot; – silver lace vine; China
*&quot;Fallopia baldschuanica&quot; (syn. &quot;Polygonum baldschuanicum&quot;) – Russian vine, mile-a-minute vine, fleece vine, fleece flower; Eastern Asia
*&quot;Fallopia convolvulus&quot; ( (syns &quot;Polygonum convolvulus&quot;, &quot;Bilderdykia convolvulus&quot;) – black-bindweed; Europe, Asia, northern Africa.
*&quot;Fallopia cristata&quot; – eastern and central United States
*&quot;Fallopia cynanchoides&quot; (syn. &quot;Polygonum cynanchoides&quot;) – western China
*&quot;Fallopia dentatoalata&quot; (syn. &quot;Polygonum dentatoalatum&quot;) – Eastern Asia
*&quot;Fallopia dumetorum&quot; (syns &quot;Polygonum dumetorum&quot;, &quot;Bilderdykia dumetorum&quot;) – copse bindweed, small-flower knotweed; Europe, Asia, northern Africa
*&quot;Fallopia filipes&quot; – Nepal
*&quot;Fallopia koreana&quot; – Korean knotweed; Korea
*&quot;Fallopia pterocarpa&quot; (syn. &quot;Polygonum pterocarpum&quot;) – Southern Asia
*&quot;Fallopia scandens&quot; (syns &quot;Polygonum scandens&quot;, &quot;Reynoutria scandens&quot;) – climbing false buckwheat; North America
*&quot;Fallopia schischkinii&quot; – Russian Far East

===Former species===
Many species at one time placed in &quot;Fallopia&quot; have been moved to other genera in the subfamily Polygonoideae. Some synonyms are listed below.
*&quot;Fallopia&quot; × &quot;bohemica&quot; → &quot;Reynoutria&quot; × &quot;bohemica&quot;, Bohemian knotweed.
*&quot;Fallopia ciliinodis&quot; – fringed black bindweed → &quot;Polygonum ciliinode&quot;
*&quot;Fallopia denticulata&quot; → &quot;Pteroxygonum denticulatum&quot;
*&quot;Fallopia japonica&quot; – Japanese knotweed → &quot;Reynoutria japonica&quot;
*&quot;Fallopia sachalinensis&quot; – giant knotweed → &quot;Reynoutria sachalinensis&quot;

===Hybrids===
Crosses between Japanese knotweed and giant knotweed have occurred where the two species grow in close proximity. The hybrid, ×&quot;Reyllopia conollyana&quot; (&quot;Reynoutria japonica&quot; × &quot;Fallopia baldschuanica&quot;) is called railway-yard knotweed.

==Distribution==
&quot;Fallopia&quot; species are native to much of the Northern Hemisphere, including most of Eurasia, North Africa and central and eastern North America. They have been widely introduced elsewhere including eastern and southern Africa, eastern North America, including Mexico, and parts of South America.

==Ecology==
&quot;Fallopia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora therinella&quot; (recorded on &quot;F. convolvulus&quot;).

<doc id="1183472" wikidata="Q2756563" url="?curid=1183472" title="Ruel Fox">
<text>Ruel Adrian Fox (born 14 January 1968) is a former professional footballer and the club chairman of Whitton United.

As a player he was a midfielder who played in the Premier League for Norwich City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. He also played in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion. He was capped twice at England B level, but later, despite it being two years since retiring, he awarded himself two caps for Montserrat whilst serving as head coach.

Following retirement, Fox had a spell as manager of non-league Whitton United, where he has also acted as assistant manager and currently remains as the chairman. He has also worked as a personal trainer and has worked for Suffolk College.

==Club career==
===Norwich City===
Fox made his senior debut for Norwich City during the 1986–87 season in a Full Members Cup match against Coventry City and made his league debut against Oxford United at Carrow Road a few days later.

After several seasons of being a substitute and finding it difficult to hold down a regular first team spot, he eventually established himself and played an important part in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 campaigns, which were two of the best in the club&#x27;s history. In 1992–93, they led the inaugural FA Premier League several times before finished a club best third, and in 1993–94 they reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, defeating Bayern Munich on the way. He had also been involved in Norwich&#x27;s runs to the semi-finals of the FA Cup final in 1989 and 1992, and their previous highs of finishing fifth in the old First Division in 1987 and fourth in 1989. 

He was a fast, tricky winger who outran defenders and provided good crosses. In 2002, Norwich supporters voted Fox an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.

===Newcastle United===
Fox left Norwich on 2 February 1994 to join Newcastle United for a fee of £2,250,000. Upon signing him, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan described him as &quot;the best player in his position in the country&quot;.

Fox was an early member of the Newcastle teams known as &quot;the Entertainers&quot;. He played in Newcastle&#x27;s final 14 games of the 1993–94 season and scored twice as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup – the first time since the 1970s that the Magpies had competed in Europe. He scored 10 league goals in the 1994–95 season, as the Magpies finished sixth and just missed out on another European campaign having led the league for the first quarter of the season, but the arrival of David Ginola in June 1995 left Fox facing a fight for regular first team action. He did, however, play five times for the Magpies the following season.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Fox signed for Tottenham Hotspur on 6 October 1995 in a deal worth £4.25 million. His fee made him Tottenham&#x27;s second most costly player at the time, behind Chris Armstrong whose £4.5 million deal had been concluded just a few months earlier. Despite not being part of Tottenham&#x27;s squad for the 1999 Football League Cup Final he made three appearances during their victorious League Cup campaign.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Fox found it difficult to settle at White Hart Lane and he was constantly linked with moves away from Tottenham Hotspur before joining West Bromwich Albion at the start of the 2000–01 season. He helped them to promotion in 2001–02, before being released at the end of the season. He subsequently retired from playing professionally.

==Coaching career==
Fox was named head coach of Montserrat in October 2004, and despite being two years since he retired from playing, he gave himself two international caps and scored once for his adopted nation in a 5–4 defeat against Antigua on 2 November 2004.

Upon his return he was named as coach of non-League football club Whitton United and remained in that role until 2008, where he was replaced by his assistant Ronnie Mauge. He has also acted as assistant manager and now is the club&#x27;s chairman. He also became a coach at Suffolk College.

==Personal life==
In November 2008, Fox returned to hometown Ipswich and ran his own restaurant and bar.

In 2012, Fox was working as a personal trainer in Ipswich.

<text>Francis Rory Peregrine &quot;Perry&quot; Anderson (born 11 September 1938) is a British intellectual, political philosopher, historian and essayist. His work ranges across historical sociology, intellectual history, and cultural analysis. What unites Anderson&#x27;s work is a preoccupation with Western Marxism.

Anderson is perhaps best known as the moving force behind the &quot;New Left Review&quot;. He is Professor of History and Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Anderson has written many books, most recently &quot;Different Speeds, Same Furies: Powell, Proust and other Literary Forms&quot; and &quot;Disputing Disaster: A Sextet on the Great War&quot;. He is the brother of political scientist Benedict Anderson (1936–2015).

== Background and early life ==
Anderson was born in London on 11 September 1938. His father, James Carew O&#x27;Gorman Anderson (1893–1946), known as Séamas, an official with the Chinese Maritime Customs, was born into an Anglo-Irish family, the younger son of Brigadier-General Sir Francis Anderson, of Ballydavid, County Waterford. He was descended from the Anderson family of Ardbrake, Bothriphnie, Scotland, who had settled in Ireland in the early 18th century.

Anderson&#x27;s mother, Veronica Beatrice Mary Bigham, was English, the daughter of Trevor Bigham, who was the Deputy Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, 1914–1931. Anderson&#x27;s grandmother, Frances, Lady Anderson, belonged to the Gaelic Gorman clan of County Clare and was the daughter of the Irish Home Rule Member of Parliament Major Purcell O&#x27;Gorman, himself the son of Nicholas Purcell O&#x27;Gorman who had been involved with the Republican Society of United Irishmen during the 1798 Rebellion, later becoming Secretary of the Catholic Association in the 1820s. Anderson&#x27;s father had previously been married to the novelist Stella Benson, and it was after her death in 1933 that he married again.

Anderson was educated at Eton and Worcester College, Oxford, where he took his first degree. Early in his life, Anderson made a brief foray into rock criticism, writing under the pseudonym Richard Merton.

== Career ==
In 1962 Anderson became editor of the &quot;New Left Review&quot;, a position he held for twenty years. As scholars of the New Left began to reassess their canon in the mid-1970s, Anderson provided an influential perspective. He published two major volumes of analytical history in 1974: &quot;Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism&quot; focuses on the creation and endurance of feudal social formations, while &quot;Lineages of the Absolutist State&quot; examines monarchical absolutism. Within their respective topics they are each vast in scope, assessing the whole history of Europe from classical times to the nineteenth century. The books achieved an instant prominence for Anderson, whose wide-ranging analysis ed elements of history, philosophy, and political theory.

In the 1980s, Anderson took office as a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York. He returned as editor at &quot;NLR&quot; in 2000 for three more years, and after his retirement continued to serve on the journal&#x27;s editorial committee. As of 2019, he has continued to make contributions to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, and pursued teaching as a Distinguished Professor of History and Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

== Influence and criticism ==

Anderson bore the brunt of the disapproval of E. P. Thompson in the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Poverty of Theory&quot;, in a controversy during the late 1970s over the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser, and the use of history and theory in the politics of the Left. In the mid-1960s, Thompson wrote an essay for the annual &quot;Socialist Register&quot; that rejected Anderson&#x27;s view of aristocratic dominance of Britain&#x27;s historical trajectory, as well as Anderson&#x27;s seeming preference for continental European theorists over radical British traditions and empiricism. Anderson delivered two responses to Thompson&#x27;s polemics, first in an essay in &quot;New Left Review&quot; (January–February 1966) called &quot;Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism&quot;, and then in a more conciliatory yet ambitious overview, &quot;Arguments within English Marxism&quot; (1980).

While Anderson faced many attacks in his native Britain for favouring continental European philosophers over British thinkers, he did not spare Western European Marxists from criticism, such as in his &quot;Considerations on Western Marxism&quot; (1976). Nevertheless, many of his assaults were delivered against postmodernist currents in continental Europe. In his book &quot;In the Tracks of Historical Materialism&quot;, Anderson depicts Paris as the new capital of intellectual reaction.

<text>Parks in the city of Markham, Ontario are maintained by the Parks and Forestry Department under the Community &amp; Fire Services Commission.

==Usage==

Most of the city parks are free, Milne Dam Conservation Area requires a fee during weekends. Most parks are closed from 12 midnight to 5am to discourage loitering. Garbage and recycling containers are available at most parks, while portable toilets are found in parks with ball or sports facilities. They are maintained by the city staff, but there is expectations users maybe asked to keep the park clean. Signage in old parks are wood and are being in process of being replaced with newer metal signs.

==History==
Markham&#x27;s park system emerged mostly in the latter part of the 20th century (earliest parks emerged during the 1960s and 1970s in Thornhill but Morgan Park in Markham Village evolved from 1924 to 1957) as it emerged into a suburban community. Parks are adding during the development of newer residential areas.

<doc id="1183490" wikidata="Q149543" url="?curid=1183490" title="Combined operations">
<text>In current military use, combined operations are operations conducted by forces of two or more allied nations acting together for the accomplishment of a common strategy, a strategic and operational and sometimes tactical cooperation. Interaction between units and formations of the land, naval and air forces, or the cooperation between military and civilian authorities in peacekeeping or disaster relief operations is known as joint operations or interoperability capability.

==Pre-modern history==

The concept of combined operations evolved largely as a result of expeditionary warfare, which can be traced to the Sea Peoples. In its basic form it involved raiding coastal regions by land forces arriving from the naval vessels. The raiding tactics were expanded into more complex operations by Alexander the Great, who used naval vessels for both troop transporting and logistics in his campaigns. The next exponents of combined operations in the ancient world of the Mediterranean Basin were the Carthaginians, who introduced two entirely-new dimensions to the use of naval forces by not only staging operations that combined naval and land troops but also eventuated in combining strategic multi-national forces during the land phase of the operation when Hannibal in his most famous achievement at the outbreak of the Second Punic War marched an army that included war elephants, from Iberia over the Pyrenees and the Alps into northern Italy. Following the example of Carthage, the Romans used combined operations extensively to expand their empire and influence in the Mediterranean and beyond, including the Roman conquest of Britain, which was not a temporary expeditionary operation but included long-term occupation and Roman settlement of the territories. After the peace agreement between Kush and the Roman Empire in 21 BC, the Kushites and the Romans performed joint military operations against several adversaries.

The next development of combined operations came from environmental pressures in the Scandinavian region during the Middle Ages and the emergence of the Viking migrations, which combined raiding, longer term inland operations, occupation and settlement. They were conducted as sea, coastal, and riverine operations, and sometimes were strategic in nature, reaching as far as Constantinople.

In Southeast Asia, the development of combined operations proceeded along the same developmental path as in Europe with the raids by the Wokou, or so-called &quot;Japanese pirates.&quot; Because the Wokou were weakly resisted by the Ming Dynasty, the raiding eventually developed into fully-fledged expeditionary warfare with the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598).

The development in combined operations reached a new level during the Crusades, when the element of political alliance was introduced as an influence on the military strategy, such as during the Sixth Crusade.

Although all combined operations until the invention of the combustion engine were largely dependent on the sailing vessels, it was with the creation of sophisticated rigging systems of the European Renaissance that the Age of Sail allowed a significant expansion in the scale of combined operations, notably by the European colonial empires. Some have argued that was the first revolution in military affairs, which changed national strategies, operational methods and tactics both at sea and on land. One notable example of that evolution was the French invasion of Egypt (1798).

==Modern history==

Though a significantly-expanded combined operation, the Crimean War was the first example of a planned combined operations campaign that was directed as part of a multinational coalition strategy. Aside from being the first modern expeditionary operation that used steam powered warships and telegraph communications, which made it the departing point for the rest of the 19th- and 20th-century developments, it was also the first used as a military theatre instrument to force decision in the conflict.

The next development in the evolution of combined operations was made during the expansion of the European empires and the era of colonialism, which also led to the inclusion of the combined operations methods into the direct expression of national strategies to avoid full-scale conflicts in the shape of the gunboat diplomacy approach. It was then that naval troops, which had been used almost exclusively for defence of vessels or minor beach operations, were expanded to enable extended littoral operations. The colonial experience, though largely confined to the period before World War I, persisted well into the 20th century.

The period of World War I was prolonged well past its completion into the 1920s and saw combined operations established as a systematic and planned operations with a larger scope than the simple transportations of troops and the beginnings of development in true combined operations at strategic, operational, and tactical levels with the unsuccessful amphibious landing at Gallipoli. That operation combined the elements of overall war planning context, multinational deployment of forces as part of the same operation, and the use of troops prepared for the landings (as opposed to disembarkation), as well as naval gunfire support that was only limited during the era of sailing ships. It also included extensive use of combat engineering in support of the infantry.

One of the most extensive and complex of combined operations that followed the war was the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, which saw forces deployed in the Baltic region, the Arctic region, along the Black Sea coast and in the Russian Far East. It for the first time saw the use of aircraft used in cooperation with the naval and land components of the deployed forces.

The phrase &quot;combined operations&quot; was first introduced by the British War Office during World War II to denote multi-service activities, those that involved air, land or naval forces acting together and coordinated by the Combined Operations Headquarters.

Given the U.S. usage of the word &quot;joint&quot; meaning such activities, the British usage faded relatively quickly. After World War II, the U.S. Department of Defense began using the term to denote multinational operations, which might mean the land forces of several countries, for example Combined Forces Land Component Command, or Combined Joint multinational multiservice activities and operations.

The term &quot;Combined Joint Task Force&quot; then took on an extra meaning, beyond that of a multinational multiservice grouping since it came to refer to a particular type of NATO deployment planning, outside the treaty area, in the late 1990s.

Since the early 1980s, the concept of combined operations had been referred to by NATO, particularly by the US. Department of Defence, as joint operations. Regardless of the use of combined, joined or interoperability terms, the concept ensures that different military organisations maintain the ability to conduct combat and non-combat military operations regardless of the national and service (ground, naval and air forces) differences.

The ability to conduct combined operations allows national forces, their subordinated formations, units or systems to perform tasks and complete missions and operations together. The overriding requirement is that they share common doctrine and procedures, utilise each other&#x27;s infrastructure and bases, and to be able to communicate with one another. These abilities reduce duplication of effort and increase economies of scale in a strategic alliance of its members, allow pooling of resources and produce synergies among its commands.

In the NATO concept, interoperability does not necessarily require common military equipment. What is important is that this equipment can share common facilities and communicate with other equipment. NATO militaries claim to have achieved interoperability because of decades of joint planning, training and exercises during the Cold War.

<text>Combined Operations Headquarters was a department of the British War Office set up during Second World War to harass the Germans on the European continent by means of raids carried out by use of combined naval and army forces.

==History==
The command used air and naval units to deliver the Commandos to various targets, and then recover them. Thus, it was a combined arms coordination and command structure. Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes was the first director, from 17 July 1940 to 27 October 1941. He was replaced first by Lord Louis Mountbatten, who led the command for a year. He in turn was succeeded by Major General Robert Laycock (October 1943 – 1947). 

It comprised background staff whose job was to plan operations and to develop ideas and equipment to harass the enemy in any way possible. It also covered all those who worked with landing craft up to and including the landing ships that were used in the various amphibious operations.

The badge of Combined Operations was an Eagle over a submachine gun over an anchor, reflecting the three service arms; the Royal Air Force, the British Army and the Royal Navy. In 1941 the title of Director of Combined Operations was changed to Adviser Combined Operations. In 1942 the title of Adviser Combined Operations was changed to Chief of Combined Operations.

The department existed until 1947 but later re-emerged under a new name in 1951, as the Amphibious Warfare Headquarters.

<text>The Markham City Council is the governing body of the city of Markham, Ontario, Canada. It consists of the mayor, eight councillors who each represent one of the city&#x27;s eight wards, and four regional councillors who, along with the mayor, are elected via double direct election to represent the city at York Regional Council.

Council meets in the chambers of the Markham Civic Centre at the corner of Warden Avenue and Highway 7.

The most recent municipal election was held in 2022.

==History==
Markham Village was incorporated as a township in 1850, establishing a council with one reeve, one deputy reeve, and three councillors. This system was used until 1 January 1971, when municipalities in York County were reorganized into the Regional Municipality of York, and Markham was newly incorporated as a town when Markham Village merged with Unionville and Thornhill east of Yonge Street. An electoral system based on six wards was established, and this numeric ward system remains mostly unchanged since its creation. Two wards were added, one in 1976 (Ward 7), and another in 1984 (Ward 8).

Minor boundary changes have taken place (1978, 1982, 1997 and 2006) with no impact on the numbering.

Most ward changes require approval by the Ontario Municipal Board (in the case of 1976 and 1997) with only the 2006 changes not requiring prior approval.

Changes were made to the boundaries for all 8 wards for 2014 elections with Thornhill assigned to Ward 1 to replace the former Ward 1 and 2 split.

The changes also take into consideration existing neighbourhoods, natural boundaries, better representation by population, effective representation and accommodation for future growth of Markham.

Then still under town status, the mayor, town councillors and regional councillors were elected by the residents of Markham every 3 years until 2006. Provincial legislation extended the election period to 4 years.

==Town Council (2006-2010)==
Regional Councillors

Regional councillors are elected at-large to represent the city at York Regional Council. By default the mayor is also a member of the Regional Council.

==Town Council (2010-2012) and City Council (2012-2014)==

The council elected in the 2010 municipal election took office on December 1, 2010. The town council members became city council members on July 1, 2012 when Markham changed from a town to a city.

Regional Councillors

Regional councillors are elected at-large to represent the city at York Regional Council. By default the mayor is also a member of the Regional Council.

==City Council (2014-2018)==

The council elected in the 2014 municipal election took office on December 1, 2014. Wards boundaries were changed with former Ward 1 and 2 combined as one (with portions moved to other wards), former Ward 6 became Ward 2.

Regional Councillors

Regional councillors are elected at-large to represent the city at York Regional Council. By default the mayor is also a member of the Regional Council.

==City Council (2018-2022)==
The following councillors were elected in the 2018 municipal election.
Regional Councillors

Regional councillors are elected at-large to represent the city at York Regional Council. By default the mayor is also a member of the Regional Council.

==City Council (2022-present)==
The following councillors were elected in the 2022 municipal election.
Regional Councillors

Regional councillors are elected at-large to represent the city at York Regional Council. By default the mayor is also a member of the Regional Council.

==Vacancies==

City council vacancies are filled by a by-election, as in the case in 2009 when then Ward 3 councillor Joseph Virgilio resigned to become Regional Councillor and Don Hamilton elected as the new Ward 3 councillor.

Prior to the Ward 3 by-election Joseph Virgilio was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of Regional Councillor Tony Wong.

==Committees==
Committees are created and chair and represented by city councillors to deal with issues and by-laws that impact the city. The chair and vice-chairs are elected selected by the mayor.

<text>&quot;&#x27;Faccetta Nera&#x27;&quot; () is a popular marching song of Fascist Italy about the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. It was written by Renato Micheli with music by Mario Ruccione in 1935. 

The lyrics are written from the perspective of a fascist Italian Blackshirt soldier during the invasion of Ethiopia. In the song, the Italian narrator tells a beautiful young enslaved Abysinnian (Ethiopian) girl that she will be liberated from slavery and ruled by a new regime. She is invited to parade with the fascist Blackshirts in Rome, where she is promised a new and better life.

==Themes==
Slavery in Ethiopia is a prominent theme in the song. The song follows the trend of Italian fascist propaganda portraying the invasion not as a war of conquest, but as a war of liberation to abolish Ethiopian slavery.

==History==
The march is said to have been inspired by a beautiful young Abyssinian girl, who was found by the Italian troops at the beginning of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.

During the invasion, the song was hugely popular in Italy and caused national fervor. During the fascist occupation of Ethiopia, Ethiopian women cohabited with Italian men in a system of concubinage known as &quot;madamismo&quot;.
The implicitly erotic song was, however, somewhat of an embarrassment for the Fascist government, which had, starting in May 1936, introduced several laws prohibiting cohabitation and marriage between Italians and native people of the Italian colonial empire. These efforts culminated in the Italian Racial Laws of 1938. The Fascist authorities considered banning the song, and removed all picture postcards depicting Abyssinian women from Roman shop windows.

==Lyrics==
==In popular culture==
The song is one of many Italian songs featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.

<text>YAM (short for Yet Another Mailer) is a MIME-compliant E-mail client written for AmigaOS and derivative operating systems. Originally created by Marcel Beck, it currently supports multiple user accounts, encrypted communications via OpenSSL and PGP, unlimited hierarchical folders and filters, a configurable GUI based on MUI, extensive ARexx support for automating tasks, and most of the features to be expected in modern E-mail clients.

== History ==

The initial release from 1995 arrived when the Internet was still something very new for the average Amiga user. However, as time passed and further 1.x updates were released, YAM became quickly popular thanks to its simplicity and comprehensible user interface at a time when competing products were either German only (MicroDot), required a shareware fee (MicroDot-II) or used a less intuitive GUI in comparison, such as Thor.

The early YAM 1.x series, while very usable for the most part, was relatively basic and spartan in terms of functionality. It wasn&#x27;t until 2.0 that finally the program started showing its full potential, featuring a major redesign of the user interface and a plethora of new features which turned it into the de facto standard Amiga E-mail client ever since.

Released in late 2000, YAM 2.2 was the last update from Marcel Beck, who ceased Amiga development but also released the sources under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. A group of Amiga developers then teamed up to coordinate and resume development, and finally in 2004 the first ever open source YAM (2.3) was released. During the next decade YAM managed to become a much more mature, stable and usable program. Along that time however, the developer team also lost most of its members, but YAM still remains today as one of the most iconic and popular pieces of Amiga software.

In April 2022 an annoucement was made that development by the YAM Development Team had ceased and YAM was discontinued. The reasons cited were due to diminishing developer numbers and the increasing burden of features that were needed to keep up to date .

AmigaKit Continues Development

In October 2024, AmigaKit Ltd restarted active development of YAM and released version 2.10 for their A600GS computer system. The new version was adapted to use AmiSSL 5.17 to give YAM up to date SSL support. A few minor bugs were also fixed and the logo was refreshed. 

A subsequent maintenance release of version 2.10 was released by AmigaKit on 28 February 2025 for the A600GS and A1200NG computer systems. 

== Recognition ==

At the peak of his popularity, and as a token of appreciation from the Amiga community at large, Marcel Beck received in 1998 the AAA Award International. The award presentation was held at the World of Amiga show in London, UK, and it was hosted by Amiga and Cloanto with the help of several Amiga user groups. Mr. Beck could not attend, but in a phone recording he stated that he felt very honored to receive the award, and thanked all YAM users around the world.

<doc id="1183512" wikidata="Q787358" url="?curid=1183512" title="Automatic stabilizer">
<text>In macroeconomics, automatic stabilizers are features of the structure of modern government budgets, particularly income taxes and welfare spending, that act to damp out fluctuations in real GDP.

The size of the government budget deficit tends to increase when a country enters a recession, which tends to keep national income higher by maintaining aggregate demand. There may also be a multiplier effect. This effect happens automatically depending on GDP and household income, without any explicit policy action by the government, and acts to reduce the severity of recessions. Similarly, the budget deficit tends to decrease during booms, which pulls back on aggregate demand. Therefore, automatic stabilizers tend to reduce the size of the fluctuations in a country&#x27;s GDP. 

==Induced taxes==
Tax revenues generally depend on household income and the pace of economic activity. Household incomes fall and the economy slows down during a recession, and government tax revenues fall as well. This change in tax revenue occurs because of the way modern tax systems are generally constructed.
*Income taxes are generally at least somewhat progressive. This means that as household incomes fall during a recession, households pay lower rates on their incomes as income tax. Therefore, income tax revenue tends to fall faster than the fall in household income.
*Corporate tax is generally based on profits, rather than revenue. In a recession profits tend to fall much faster than revenue. Therefore, a company pays much less tax while having slightly less economic activity.
*Sales tax depends on the dollar volume of sales, which tends to fall during recessions.

If national income rises, by contrast, then tax revenues will rise. During an economic boom, tax revenue is higher and in a recession tax revenue is lower, not only in absolute terms but as a proportion of national income.

Some other forms of taxation do not exhibit these effects, if they bear no relation to income (e.g. poll taxes, export tariffs or property taxes).

===Transfer payments===
Most governments also pay unemployment and welfare benefits. Generally speaking, the number of unemployed people and those on low incomes who are entitled to other benefits increases in a recession and decreases in a boom. As a result, government expenditure increases automatically in recessions and decreases automatically in booms in absolute terms. Since output increases in booms and decreases in recessions, expenditure is expected to increase as a share of income in recessions and decrease as a share of income in booms.

==Incorporated into the expenditure multiplier==
This section incorporates automatic stabilization into a broadly Keynesian multiplier model.

formula_1
*MPC = Marginal propensity to consume (fraction of incremental income spent on domestic consumption)
*T = Marginal (induced) tax rate (fraction of incremental income that is paid in taxes)
*MPI = Marginal Propensity to Import (fraction of incremental income spent on imports)

Holding all other things constant, ceteris paribus, the greater the level of taxes, or the greater the MPI then the value of this multiplier will drop. For example, lets assume that:

:→ &quot;MPC&quot; = 0.8

:→ &quot;T&quot; = 0

:→ &quot;MPI&quot; = 0.2

Here we have an economy with zero marginal taxes and zero transfer payments. If these figures were substituted into the multiplier formula, the resulting figure would be 2.5. This figure would give us the instance where a (for instance) $1 billion change in expenditure would lead to a $2.5 billion change in equilibrium real GDP.

Lets now take an economy where there are positive taxes (an increase from 0 to 0.2), while the MPC and MPI remain the same:

:→ &quot;MPC&quot; = 0.8

:→ &quot;T&quot; = 0.2

:→ &quot;MPI&quot; = 0.2

If these figures were now substituted into the multiplier formula, the resulting figure would be 1.79. This figure would give us the instance where, again, a $1 billion change in expenditure would now lead to only a $1.79 billion change in equilibrium real GDP.

This example shows us how the multiplier is lessened by the existence of an automatic stabilizer and thus helping to lessen the fluctuations in real GDP as a result of changes in expenditure. Not only does this example work with changes in T, it would also work by changing the MPI while holding MPC and T constant as well.

There is broad consensus among economists that automatic stabilizers often exist and function in the short term.

Additionally, imports often tend to decrease in a recession, meaning more of the national income is spent at home rather than abroad. This also helps stabilize the economy.

==Estimated effects==

Analysis conducted by the Congressional Budget Office in 2013 estimated the effects of automatic stabilizers on budget deficits and surpluses in each fiscal year since 1960. The analysis found, for example, that stabilizers increased the deficit by 32.9% in fiscal 2009, as the deficit soared to $1.4 trillion as a result of the Great Recession, and by 47.6% in fiscal 2010. Stabilizers increased deficits in 30 of the 52 years from 1960 through 2012. In each of the five surplus years during the period, stabilizers contributed to the surplus; the $3 billion surplus in 1969 would have been a $13 billion deficit if not for stabilizers, and 60% of the 1999 $126 billion surplus was attributed to stabilizers.

<text>Spencer John Bent, VC, MM (known as &quot;Joe&quot;) (18 March 1891 – 3 May 1977) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Biography ==
He was 23 years old, and a drummer in the 1st Battalion, The East Lancashire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On the night of 1–2 November 1914, near Le Gheer, Belgium, when his officer, the platoon sergeant and a number of men had been struck down, Drummer Bent took command of the platoon and with great presence of mind and coolness succeeded in holding the position. He had previously distinguished himself on two occasions, on 22 and 24 October by bringing up ammunition under heavy shell and rifle fire. Again, on 3 November, he brought into cover some wounded men who were lying, exposed to enemy fire, in the open.

Bent was a Freemason and was initiated into Aldershot Camp Lodge No. 1331 on 8 December 1920.

He later achieved the rank of Company Sergeant-Major. He survived the war and died on 3 May 1977. Bent was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery, London.

Bent&#x27;s VC, along with his Military Medal and Russian Cross of St. George was sold at auction in June 2000 for £80,000. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1183515" wikidata="Q7438821" url="?curid=1183515" title="Scratch drive actuator">
<text>A scratch drive actuator (SDA) is a microelectromechanical system device that converts electrical energy into one-dimensional motion.

==Description==
The actuator component can come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the fabrication method used. It can be visualised as an &#x27;L&#x27;. The smaller end is called the &#x27;bushing&#x27;.

The actuator sits on top of a substrate that has a thin insulating dielectric layer on top. A voltage is applied between the actuator and the substrate, and the resulting potential pulls the body of the actuator downwards. When this occurs, the brush is pushed forwards by a small amount, and energy is stored in the strained actuator. When the voltage is removed, the actuator springs back into shape while the bushing remains in its new position. By applying a pulsed voltage, the SDA can be made to move forward.

The voltage is usually applied to the actuator by means of a &#x27;tether&#x27;. This can consist of a rigid connector or a rail which the SDA follows.

The size of an SDA is typically measured on the μm scale.

<doc id="1183516" wikidata="Q2992976" url="?curid=1183516" title="Congaree River">
<text>The Congaree River is a short but wide river in South Carolina in the United States; It flows for approximately 53 miles (85 km). The river serves an important role as the final outlet channel for the entire Lower Saluda and Lower Broad watersheds, before merging with the Wateree River just north of Lake Marion to form the Santee River.

It is formed in Columbia by the confluence of the Saluda and Broad rivers near the Piedmont Fall Line. It serves as part of the boundary between Richland, Calhoun, and Lexington counties. The only cities near the river are Columbia on the east, and Cayce and West Columbia on the west.

Despite the vast bottomland swamp below Columbia, the Congaree is navigable along much of its length at high water by barge traffic. This travels upriver from the Port of Charleston (approximately 100 miles (167 km) away through the Santee-Cooper Lakes to within 5 miles (8 km) of the fall line.

The Congaree National Park, one of the main recreational attractions of the river, is located about halfway down the river&#x27;s course. The 22,200-acre (90 km²) park contains some of the last remaining old growth bottomland hardwood forest in North America. Recreational opportunities include hiking, biking, bird watching, botanical interests, and canoeing.

The river was named for the Congaree Native Americans who used to live along it.

==Crossings==
Below is a list of crossings from the river&#x27;s origin in Columbia downstream to its confluence with the Wateree, where it forms the Santee River:

<doc id="1183521" wikidata="Q7974268" url="?curid=1183521" title="Waterloo Region Record">
<text>The Waterloo Region Record (formerly The Record) is the daily newspaper covering Waterloo Region, Ontario, Canada, including the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, as well as the surrounding area. Since December 1998, the &quot;Record&quot; has been published by Metroland Media Group, a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation. On May 26, 2020, Torstar, agreed to be acquired by NordStar Capital, a private investment firm; the deal was expected to close by year end.

==History==
The &quot;Record&quot; traces its history back to the founding of the &quot;Daily News&quot;, first published on February 9, 1878, by former Methodist preacher Peter Moyer at a printing press located at King and Ontario streets in Berlin (now Kitchener). This would be the city&#x27;s first daily newspaper, and Canada&#x27;s first bilingual daily as it was supplemented with a full page of German news for the first eight months of its life.

In 1896, at the time of Moyer&#x27;s death, three newspapers existed in the city of Berlin: the &quot;Berlin Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Berlin Daily Record&quot; and Moyer&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot;. Due to financial pressures, by 1897 the latter two had merged to become the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot;, run by William (Ben) Uttley, publisher of the &quot;Berlin Daily Record&quot; and local historian. Retiring in October 1919, Uttley sold the newspaper to W.J. Motz and William Daum Euler, who renamed it &quot;The Kitchener Daily Record&quot;.

In 1922, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; took over the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, leaving it the only newspaper of significant size serving the community. On April 2, 1929, the newspaper moved from 49 King Street West to what was at the time considered the most modern printing operation in the country (using a 24-page press) at 30 Queen Street North. Motz and Euler fought over control of the newspaper for the next two decades, with the former eventually winning majority interest. Euler sold his stock to Southam Company in 1953, leaving Motz&#x27;s son, John E. Motz, the sole director of the rapidly growing daily.

On January 1, 1948, John Motz changed the name of the newspaper once again, to &quot;The Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot; (to mark the occasion of Waterloo&#x27;s designation as a city), a name which remained until the change to &quot;The Record&quot;, in 1994. During this period the 24-page press would be replaced first by a 48-page press in the 1950s, a 96-page press in 1961–1962, and a 128-page press in 1973. In 1962, it was the first company in Canada to use plastic sleeves to protect newspapers bound for rural addresses.

Ownership had been in the hands of the Motz family for generations until 1990, when the paper was sold to Southam in a $90 million deal. Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Inc. took a controlling interest in Southam during the period when it owned &quot;The Record&quot;. The paper was acquired by Sun Media in 1998, but Sun itself was bought by Quebecor soon after, and &quot;The Record&quot; was sold to Torstar before the end of the year. The administrative records and photographic negatives of the paper amassed prior to the Sun Media acquisition are maintained at the University of Waterloo Library.

On June 3, 2002, &quot;The Record&quot; switched from being an afternoon newspaper to morning one.

In January 2005, the paper was moved to Market Square on King Street East in Kitchener&#x27;s downtown core. It had been based on Fairway Road in Kitchener since May 1973. The paper was printed at that location on a letterpress system until 2000, when printing was moved to offset presses at parent company Torstar&#x27;s Vaughan Press Centre in Vaughan. Printing later moved to presses of sister papers in Hamilton and Guelph, and then back to Vaughan from time to time. As of 2014, the Record is usually printed at the Star-owned Hamilton Spectator. On May 24, 2019, Torstar Corporation announced it will close its Hamilton Spectator printing operations on or about August 24, 2019. The printing work (including printing of the Record) performed at the Hamilton facility will be transferred to TC Transcontinental Printing, various Torstar-owned facilities, and other external printers.

The Record building on Fairway Road in Kitchener was demolished in September 2005.

On March 11, 2008, the name was changed to the &quot;Waterloo Region Record&quot;, returning the community name to the nameplate.

In early 2018, the company announced that it would set up a paywall on its website. Consumers who do not pay the fee to subscribe will be allowed to read only seven articles per month. An article published by CBC News indicated that this strategy has not been successful for some newspapers. The New York Times has a million subscribers but the publication has an international cachet that makes it a &quot;must-read&quot;, especially in the U.S. where Fake news has been widespread.

== Circulation ==
The &quot;Waterloo Region Record&quot; has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 53,283 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

:::::::::Daily average
==Awards==

&quot;The Record&quot; has won the Michener Award for meritorious public service in journalism four times: 1978, 1981 (shared), 1983, and 2001. It received the 2001 award for breaking the story on the RIM Park financing fiasco.

==Other publications==

In November 2005, the &quot;Record&quot; began publishing &quot;Grand&quot;, a regional lifestyle magazine. It followed that with the March 2006 launch of &quot;Rex&quot;, a business magazine covering Waterloo Region and Guelph. &quot;Most&quot; magazine, for women over 40, was launched in the spring of 2008. &quot;Rex&quot; was scheduled to suspend publication after the April 2009 issue. All magazines are distributed independently of the newspaper.

Both the &quot;Cambridge Times&quot; and the &quot;Record&quot; are owned and published by Metroland Media Group but keep separate newsrooms and operations.

<text>John Steele (November 16, 1764 – August 14, 1815) was a planter, Federalist legislator, comptroller of the U.S. Treasury, and member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of North Carolina between 1790 and 1793.

==Life and career==
Born in Salisbury, North Carolina in 1764, the son of Elizabeth Maxwell Gillespie and William Steele, John Steele attended Clio&#x27;s Nursery and the English School, both near his hometown. Named assessor in 1784 and a town commissioner in 1787, Steele was first elected to the North Carolina House of Commons from the Salisbury District in 1787 and served again multiple times: in 1788, 1794, 1795, 1806, and from 1811 to 1813. He was Speaker of the House in 1811. He was a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional convention in Hillsborough in 1788 and to the 1789 convention in Fayetteville which ratified the U.S. Constitution, and was a special commissioner from North Carolina to treat with the Cherokee and Chickasaw Indians from 1788 to 1790.

From April 19, 1790, until March 3, 1793, Steele was a member of the United States House of Representatives. A Federalist, he was considered Pro-Administration. He opposed assumption of the state debt by the Federal government and the excise tax on whiskey. He was also a U.S. Senate candidate in 1792.

On July 1, 1796, Steele was appointed Comptroller of the Treasury by President George Washington; he was reappointed by Presidents Adams and Jefferson until his resignation on December 15, 1802. In 1805, Steele was appointed to the board of commissioners tasked with determining the dividing lines between North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, where he served until 1814.

===Death===
Steele died on August 14, 1815, in his hometown of Salisbury; that same day, he had been elected again to the North Carolina House of Commons. He is buried in Salisbury&#x27;s Chestnut Hill Cemetery.

===Legacy===
The John Steele House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

<doc id="1183548" wikidata="Q16030255" url="?curid=1183548" title="Lord William Beresford">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Lord William Leslie de la Poer Beresford (20 July 1847 – 30 December 1900) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Beresford was born on 20 July 1847. He was the third son of the Church of Ireland minister John Beresford, 4th Marquess of Waterford and his wife, the former Christiana Leslie. His eldest brother, John Beresford, became the 5th Marquess of Waterford and his second brother, Admiral Charles Beresford, became the 1st Baron Beresford. His younger brother, Lord Marcus Beresford, was a prominent equerry and racing manager.

His maternal grandfather was Charles Powell Leslie II, an Irish member of the UK Parliament for Monaghan and New Ross, and his paternal grandfather was Henry Beresford, 2nd Marquess of Waterford.

Beresford was sent to Eton College in 1858. When he was 16, he left Eton for Bonn, where he studied French and German at the home of a tutor.

==Career==
In 1867, at the age of 20, he joined the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers as a cornet.
In 1875, the regiment was sent to India, where it was stationed at Sialkot. Later that year he was appointed &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Lord Northbrook, the retiring Viceroy, in Calcutta. He did some racing, and won the Corinthian Purse at a meet attended by the Prince of Wales.

===Zulu war===

Beresford became a captain in the 9th Lancers during the Zulu War of 1879.
On 3 July 1879 at Ulundi, Zululand, South Africa, during the retirement of a reconnoitring party, Captain Lord William Beresford went to the assistance of Sergeant Fitzmaurice of the 24th Regiment, whose horse had fallen and rolled on him. The Zulus were coming in great numbers, but Lord William, with help from Sergeant Edmund O&#x27;Toole of the Frontier Light Horse., managed to mount the injured man behind him. He was, however, so dizzy that Sergeant O&#x27;Toole, who had been keeping back the advancing Zulus, gave up his carbine and, riding alongside, helped to hold him on until they reached safety.

Initially the VC was only awarded to Beresford but he told the Queen that O&#x27;Toole also deserved the honour:

:&quot;Her Majesty pinning it on to the hero&#x27;s breast, but not before he had explained to his Queen he could not in honour receive recognition of any services he had been able to perform, unless Sergeant O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s services were also recognised, as he deserved infinitely greater credit than any that might attach to himself. The Queen, appreciating this generosity and soldierly honesty, bestowed the reward also on Sergeant Edmund OToole of Baker&#x27;s Horse, and Lord William was satisfied.&quot;

===Later career===

Lord William Beresford became a member of the staff of the Viceroy of India. He won the Viceroy&#x27;s cup at the Calcutta Turf Club in 1881 with his black gelding Camballo.
He later won it three more times with Myall King.
Beresford strongly believed in the merits of English thoroughbreds. He was rivalled in Indian racing circles by the wealthy Calcutta merchant Apcar Alexander Apcar, who owned a stud of Australian race horses, and his partner the barrister Malcolm Peter Gasper. This competition did much to improve the quality of horses in India.
In England, Beresford&#x27;s filly Sibola won the 1899 1,000 Guineas Stakes, and came second in The Oaks.
In 1899 his two-year-old Democrat beat Diamond Jubilee, winner of the Triple Crown.
Democrat did not continue racing, but later was Lord Kitchener&#x27;s charger in India.

Lord William Beresford achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Personal life==
In 1895, he married American heiress and socialite Lillian, Duchess of Marlborough, widow of George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough, and daughter of Commodore Cicero Price. Together, Lily and William were the parents of one child: 

* William Warren de la Poer Beresford (1897–1919).

He died at Deepdene, Dorking, Surrey on 30 December 1900 from peritonitis at the age of 53.

<text>William Barry Grove (January 15, 1764 – March 30, 1818) was a Federalist U.S. Congressman from the state of North Carolina from 1791 to 1803.

Grove was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1764. After studying law, he was admitted to the state bar and became a practicing attorney. In 1786, Grove was first elected to the North Carolina House of Commons; he would serve again in 1788 and 1789. In 1788, Grove was a delegate to the state convention that considered ratification of the United States Constitution; he voted against postponement of ratification, but the state did not ratify the constitution at that time. Grove was also a delegate to the 1789 state convention where North Carolina finally ratified the federal constitution.

A trustee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the president of the Fayetteville Branch of the Bank of the United States, Grove was elected to the Second United States Congress in 1790; he was re-elected to the 3rd through 7th Congresses as a Federalist, serving consecutively from March 4, 1791 to March 3, 1803. Although he ran for re-election in 1802, he was defeated for a seat in the 8th U.S. Congress.

Despite being a Federalist, Grove was close to Democratic-Republicans in his political views: he opposed Alexander Hamilton and his policies toward the public debt, preferring Jefferson, and he supported the French Revolution while criticizing Britain.

As a southern Federalist, Grove argued in favour of seizing Louisiana, at a time when (before the Louisiana Purchase) the Spanish intendant at New Orleans withdrew the right of free deposit for American goods. According to JH Broussard, Federalists believed &quot;Jefferson should use the intendant&#x27;s closure of deposit as an excuse to occupy the territory before France took formal control&quot; from the Spanish. The Purchase occurred in 1803, against majority Federalist opposition.

Grove was an ardent Freemason and member of Phoenix Lodge No. 8, Fayetteville, North Carolina. He died in 1818 and is buried in Fayetteville&#x27;s Grove Creek Cemetery.

<text>Ghostzilla is a discontinued open source web browser for Microsoft Windows based on Mozilla Application Suite 1.0.1. It ran the browser inside the window space of another application (e.g. in Microsoft Outlook), where the page was then made to look like the content in an email. When moving the cursor out of the window, the browser subsequently disappeared.

==History==
Ghostzilla was originally launched as a shareware project priced at US$19.95. The project then became freeware and later open source. From May 2004 until January 2005, the project was removed from public view due to a copyright claim from Mozilla. It later returned with code directly derived from Mozilla&#x27;s open source, excluding the core proprietary library used to create minimal pages and desaturated colors. It also came with warnings about the potential for misuse. In February 2007, the site was removed.

In March 2006, users of Firefox had the option of installing a free add-on called &quot;Ghostfox&quot;, which aimed to mimic Ghostzilla&#x27;s behavior in Firefox, although from June 2010 this extension was no longer compatible with Firefox 3.5. An open source project, &quot;InstaBrowser&quot;, appeared in July 2007 mimicking Ghostzilla&#x27;s ideas. By September 2009 this project was renamed &quot;Ninja Browser&quot; but was again short-lived.

==Features==

Ghostzilla is a browser which can be used directly from a CD or USB stick.
Ghostzilla changes the layout of the web pages pending on the user&#x27;s preferences as categorized into 6 different &quot;stealth modes&quot;:
*As simple text (without any CSS, advertisement, or pop-ups).
*Images are hidden or grayed out.

Users can change their preferences so that the navigation bar turns off.
If the cursor is placed outside the Ghostzilla window, Ghostzilla hides itself and can be viewed again by a mouse gesture.

<text>Welford is a village and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire unitary authority area of Northamptonshire, England, just south of the River Avon and the border with Leicestershire. At the 2011 census, the population of the parish was 1,043.

==Location==
It is on the main A5199 road connecting Northampton and Leicester and, being halfway between the two, was an important stagecoach stop. The A5199 is known as the &#x27;Welford Road&#x27; for much of its length. It is close to the junction of the two major motor routes in England – the M1 motorway and the M6 motorway – and is 1½ miles north of Junction 1 of the A14, which connects that junction with the east of England.

==History==

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;ford with a spring/stream&#x27;.

In medieval times its Premonstratensian Abbey moved to Sulby some two miles to the east and Welford lost its market charter which was sold to West Haddon. There is clear evidence that Welford shrank considerably during the medieval period and it is notable that three of its neighbouring civil parishes – Elkington, Stanford-on-Avon and Sulby – are almost entirely depopulated.

In 2016, a new housing estate was built called Miller&#x27;s Lock. While the builders were digging up the foundations, they found the remains of an Iron Age roundhouse.

A silver cup dating from the sixteenth century that was found in the village is in the British Museum.

The history of the parish has been the subject of two books:
*Welford: Portrait of a Northamptonshire Village&quot;
*Welford: The Legacy 1856 to 1980

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains a total of 38 entries for listed buildings in the parish of Welford. These are all Grade II, apart from St Mary&#x27;s Church, which is Grade II*. They include:
*St Mary&#x27;s Church, Church Lane
*The Talbot, High Street
*Manor House, West Street
*Welford Congregational Church, West End

==Facilities==
It is served by a short arm from the Grand Union Canal and has two marinas. The Jurassic Way long distance footpath passes through the village on a southwest–northeast axis; although it officially makes its way through the fields to the east of the village, many walkers prefer to walk along the High Street to make use of the village&#x27;s facilities.
Welford has a village shop and post office, a beauty therapy studio, a Church of England Endowed primary school, a garage, and one public house. Another public house lies just over the Leicestershire border, but is reached by walking through the Welford Pocket Park.

The primary school is part of the Peterborough Diocese Education Trust and accepts children from the surrounding parishes, giving the name Welford, Sibbertoft and Sulby Endowed School (WSSES). There are around 85 pupils at the school. WSSES is a feeder school to the secondary provision of Guilsborough Academy, in the neighbouring village of Guilsborough, Northamptonshire.

Other amenities include a village hall, a sports field which is home to Welford Victoria F.C., a youth centre and a pocket park. There is also a spinney which is near the park and was a gravel quarry in the 19th century. To the North East of the village lie Welford Reservoir and Sulby Reservoir.

A painted wood carving of Postman Pat and his black and white cat, Jess stands at the junction of High Street and West Street. It was crowd funded by villagers and installed in 2019 after the previous statues, which stood in the same spot for 25 years, rotted away.

It is now administered as part of West Northamptonshire. Previously it was in Daventry District (1974–2021) having earlier been part of Oxendon Rural District (1894–1935) followed by Brixworth Rural District (1935–74).

<doc id="1183561" wikidata="Q17063546" url="?curid=1183561" title="Twisted Issues">
<text>Twisted Issues is a 1988 splatter film billed as a &#x27;psycho-punk splatter-comedy&#x27;. It featured Gainesville, Florida punk bands such as Psychic Violents, Young Pioneers, Mutley Chix, Doldrums, Just Demigods, Cindy Brady&#x27;s Lisp, Officer Friendly, and the Smegmas, as well as local speed metal band Hellwitch and avantgarde incidental music by The Bill Perry Orchestra. Director Charles Pinion went on to make several other underground movies (&quot;Red Spirit Lake&quot;, &quot;We Await&quot; and the 2014 3D feature &quot;American Mummy&quot;).

&quot;Twisted Issues&quot; was originally intended to be a punk rockumentary featuring Gainesville bands, but the inclusion of writers Steve Antczak and Hawk (James C. Bassett) to the mix added the horror, element to the story, featuring a so-called Death Skater who kills characters played by members of the aforementioned bands after they inadvertently kill him. Segments of the movie were written by different people, notably Chuck Speta (&quot;Atomic Comix&quot;). Special effects by David Peck (aka Bad Guy #4 Backseat) bringing all the horror to life on screen. &#x27;Film Threat Video Guide&quot; called &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; one of the 25 Must-See Underground Movies of the 1980s. In 2011 the exhaustive encyclopedia of punks on film, &quot;Destroy All Movies&quot;, had a section on &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; and its director, Charles Pinion. In 2013, Headpress released &quot;Bleeding Skull!: A 1980s Trash-Horror Odyssey&quot;, which covered &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; and other shot-on-video (SOV) movies.

The VHS version of &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; has been long unavailable. A limited edition DVD (313 copies made) of &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; is sold from the filmmaker&#x27;s website.

In 2013, Don Abendroth of The Video Pharmacy released a limited edition (25 copies) of &quot;Twisted Issues&quot; that included a tiny bloody skateboard and TV set, as well as the soundtrack on cassette, and a new printing of the original booklet.

<doc id="1183564" wikidata="Q803791" url="?curid=1183564" title="Claregalway">
<text>Baile Chláir or Baile Chláir na Gaillimhe (anglicised Claregalway) is a Gaeltacht village about 10 km north of Galway city in County Galway, Ireland. Claregalway was founded on the banks of the River Clare, hence the derivation of its name: &quot;Baile Chláir na Gaillimhe&quot; meaning &quot;town on the Clare, in Galway&quot;. Claregalway lies within the Gaeltacht and traditionally most of the locals would have spoken English only as a second language. Until September 2017, the village sat at the junction of the busy N17 and N18 national primary routes with over 27,000 vehicles having formerly passed through the village every day. The village is in a civil parish and barony of the same name.

==Irish language==
According to the 2022 census there were 1,632 people living in Baile Chláir, of which less than 2% claimed they spoke Irish every day outside of the education system. This makes Baile Chláir one of the weakest Gaeltacht towns in the country, with the vast majority of the population speaking English.

==History==
This village has an ancient heritage stretching back over a thousand years. It has many features of historical interest but two of the largest ones on the banks of the river include the Claregalway Friary, founded in mid-13th century, and a Norman watchtower (small castle) completed in the 16th century. During 2001, a restoration of an old bridge over the old course of the River Clare was completed. These nine stone arches are above the level of the current road.

Claregalway Parish is one of the largest in the county and includes a number of townlands (small clusters of houses) some of the bigger being Carnmore, Lydican, Loughgeorge and Cregboy. Lydican is notable as the origin of the Irish ancestors (Patrick Lynch) of Che Guevara. Lydican was actually an O&#x27;Heyne Castle and the last of the chieftains, Connor Crone O Heyne, was living there in 1612. The lands of the O&#x27;Heyne chieftains was confiscated in the late 17th century and it was then that the Lynches took up residence there. The Lynches principal holdings were in the city of Galway.

==Economy==
Agriculture would once have been the main industry. The population has doubled between 2006 and 2022, since the village is within the commuter belt of Galway City.

==Culture==
Claregalway hosts a drama festival each year in March. Compántas Lir is an amateur drama group which is based in Claregalway and Carnmore.

==Education==
* Coláiste Bhaile Chláir

==Sport==
Claregalway CLG is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

Claregalway Basketball club participate in local leagues at underage through to senior level.

Claregalway Handball club has members from 7 to 70+ years old. A new-arena style handball alley was opened by the club in 2018.

==Annals of Connacht==
&quot;1469: O Domnaill led a great army into Connacht to meet Macwilliam Burke. They both proceeded to Claregalway and burnt the town in spite of Thomond and Macwilliam, spent a night encamped there and were refused battle then. The next day they burnt the whole of Machaire Clainne Taidc, killing many horses and many men, including Domnall, son of O Conchobair of Corcomroe.&quot;

==Notable residents==

<text>The Conservative Research Department (CRD) is part of the central organisation of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. It operates alongside other departments of Conservative Campaign Headquarters in Westminster.

The CRD has been described as a training ground for leading Conservative politicians. Former CRD advisers to have served in the Cabinet include former Prime Minister David Cameron, incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Letwin and former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. After 1945, Enoch Powell, Iain Macleod, Reginald Maudling and Chris Patten passed through it.

==History==

===Neville Chamberlain===
The CRD was established by Neville Chamberlain in 1929, to undertake detailed policy work for the leader of the Party (then Stanley Baldwin) and his principal colleagues. It was the first real think-tank on the right in British politics. For 50 years it occupied its own premises in Old Queen Street overlooking St James&#x27;s Park, but after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher united it physically with the rest of the Party&#x27;s Central Office.

===Rab Butler===
The CRD&#x27;s work was suspended during the Second World War, but it was re-established on a wider basis with a larger staff by Rab Butler, who would be its chairman from 1945 until 1965 Its post-war role included the provision of briefing material on major legislation before Parliament and on the main issues of political controversy, as well as working with Butler to define post-war Conservatism.

The CRD determined Conservative policy during the post-war consensus until it broke down in the 1970s. The series of Campaign Guides that the CRD began to produce in 1950 recorded in detail the progress of Conservative governments in this period. More recent volumes in the series have continued to provide a full, official account of Conservative policy and its implementation.

===Margaret Thatcher===
When Margaret Thatcher became Conservative Party leader in 1975, the CRD organised a full policy review to be co-ordinated by Sir Keith Joseph which preceded her election as prime minister. Unimpressed by what the department then had to offer, she and Sir Keith Joseph set up their own think-tank, the Centre for Policy Studies in 1975 on her becoming Leader of the Opposition. The CPS was financed by Nigel (later Lord) Vinson, and its first director was the late Alfred (later Sir) Sherman, who became Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s speechwriter when she entered Downing Street. Sir Keith&#x27;s key political assistant at the CPS was Philip van der Elst, a former Treasurer of the Oxford Union in which post he had directly succeeded Ann Widdecombe. Later when in office, Mrs Thatcher valued the CRD primarily for the way in which it communicated to the Conservative Party at large that radical political change was needed and how Britain was being transformed as a result of these changes. The CRD was a link between a reforming administration and the party on whose support it depended. It produced her general election manifestos and worked closely with her during election campaigns. The director appointed in 1979 was Adam Ridley, who since 1974 had been Economic Adviser to the Shadow Cabinet.

In 1989, the CRD co-funded a trip of David Cameron and other Conservative researchers to South Africa while under apartheid rule, alongside the Strategy Network International, which was created in 1985 to lobby against anti-apartheid sanctions.

The group continued to work closely with the party leader and other senior figures. During the 2005 election campaign, the CRD was again the leader&#x27;s policy secretariat, assisting Michael Howard&#x27;s close advisers with the formulation of the Conservative position on key subjects and the development of the strategy for the campaign. Under the editorship of Alistair Cooke, the CRD also wrote and published the latest volume of the Campaign Guide, providing detailed policy and political attack material.

===David Cameron===
Under David Cameron the CRD was reorganised; in June 2006, Desk Officers were retitled as Special Advisers to the Shadow Cabinet and relocated to the House of Commons, while the enlarged political section and policy secretariat remained at Campaign HQ. This was reversed the following year when, in September 2007, the possibility of an early general election prompted the Party leadership to move Special Advisers back in-house to the new Campaign Headquarters at 30 Millbank.

<doc id="1183594" wikidata="Q61652" url="?curid=1183594" title="Otto von Gierke">
<text>Otto Friedrich von Gierke, born Otto Friedrich Gierke (11 January 1841 – 10 October 1921), was a German legal scholar and historian. He is considered today as one of the most influential and important legal scholars of the 19th and 20th century. In his four-volume magnum opus entitled &quot;Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht&quot; (&quot;German Law of Associations&quot;), he pioneered the study of social groups and the importance of associations in German life, which stood between the divide of private and public law.

During his career at Berlin University&#x27;s law department, Gierke was a leading critic of the first draft of a new Civil Code for Imperial Germany. Gierke argued that it had been molded in an individualistic frame that was inconsistent with German social traditions. Gierke became known as a vocal Germanist within the German Historical School of Jurisprudence. The draft was revised to remove Roman law influences and the German Civil Code came into effect in 1900.

==Career==

In 1841 Otto Friedrich Gierke was born in Stettin (Szczecin), Pomerania, as the son of a Prussian civil servant. He was ennobled with a hereditary title on his 70th birthday in 1911, becoming Otto von Gierke at the climax of his long academic career. The young Gierke studied at universities in Heidelberg and Berlin. In Berlin he was taught by Georg Beseler, a jurist and member of the Prussian House of Lords. Beseler was an expert on German law and Gierke received his doctorate for a thesis on the obligations arising from medieval fiefdom (&quot;Lebensschulden&quot;).

After serving in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War as a lieutenant, Gierke returned to Berlin to pursue an academic career. In 1868 he published his professorial dissertation on the legal history of the German cooperative (&quot;Rechtsgeschichte der deutschen Genossenschaft&quot;). Gierke argued that the cooperative was at the center of German communal order since ancient times and that the Germanic sense of justice set Germanic law apart from Roman law. Gierke established his reputation as foremost academic expert on Germanic jurisprudence in 1868, when he published the first volume of &quot;The German Law of Associations&quot; (&quot;Das Deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht&quot;). Gierke was encouraged to publish at the insistence of Theodor Mommsen. Gierke worked as a private lecturer in Berlin and served in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. He was appointed as adjunct professor in 1871 after returning from military service. The second volume of &quot;The German Law of Associations&quot; (&quot;Das Deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht&quot;) was published in 1873, a third volume was published in 1881, the fourth and final volume was published in 1913.

Gierke had a distinguished academic career. In 1872 the German University of Breslau appointed him as regular professor. While serving as acting rector, Gierke became prominent in academic circles for his research on Johannes Althusius. In his publications, Gierke asserted that Althusius&#x27; theory of the state as a social organism based on associations amounted to a native German tradition of social contract and sovereignty. From 1884 until 1887 he held a professorship at Heidelberg University and he served as professor at the prestigious Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin from 1887 until his death in 1921.

===Influence on the 1900 Civil Code===
Gierke became a vocal critic of the 1888 draft for a Civil Code to harmonize private law on property, family, and obligations, following the Unification of Germany in 1871. Imperial Germany under Otto von Bismarck consisted of 25 federal states with legal systems based on Roman law, customary law that had developed out of Germanic law, as well as elements of the Napoleonic Code. Gierke opposed the 1888 draft for a new Civil Code because parts of it were based on Roman law. In the course of the academic debate on the draft, Gierke emerged as an outspoken Germanist within the German Historical School of Jurisprudence.

Gierke formulated a historic critique of the draft civil code by relying on ancient and medieval German laws that the jurist and folklorist Jacob Grimm had collected on the municipality (&quot;Gemeinde&quot;) and the Mark currency. Gierke plausibly argued that the legal norms found in feudal contracts, town charters, as well as the letters patent governing merchant and craft guilds amounted to a native Germanic legal tradition. Throughout 1888 and 1889 Gierke criticized the draft civil code in articles that were published in the leading German language economics journal. Its editor Gustav von Schmoller took the view that the norms of the Roman law tradition did not adequately support the business models of a market economy that was industrialized. Gierke further bolstered his critique of the draft civil code by publishing the first of a three-volume opus on German private law (&quot;Deutsches Privatrecht&quot;) in 1895.

The first draft civil code was revised to remove Roman law influences and a further draft was published in 1896. It did not consider the social needs of its times and prompted Gierke to publish his most quoted criticism of the German civil code: &quot;In our private law a drop of social oil has to seep through!&quot;. Gierke was especially opinionated when criticizing the tenancy law in the new draft for ignoring the burning issues in modern German cities. He demanded that the German civil code should protect tenants against usury by placing legal restrictions on the freedom of contract. Gierke&#x27;s demands for social laws to be enshrined in the draft went unheard. The new German Civil Code came into effect in 1900.

===Influence on the 1919 Weimar Constitution===
In 1905 Gierke published the second volume on German private law (&quot;Deutsches Privatrecht&quot;) offering a detailed critique of the unrestrained freedom that was guaranteed to the owners of private property in §903 of the German Civil Code. According to the law: &quot;the owner of a thing can, so far as not contrary to law or the rights of third parties, deal with the thing at discretion and exclude others from every use or misuse of it.&quot; Gierke railed against §903, arguing that property ownership was subject to limitations because it confers powers bound by rights. He maintained that according to German legal principle, property ownership is pervaded by responsibilities. While Gierke&#x27;s influence on legislation was limited, his lectures and publications became influential at German language universities. Gierke&#x27;s views on the social obligations arising from property ownership were eventually enshrined in the 1919 Weimar Constitution, which stated in Article 153 that &quot;Property ownership carries an obligation. Its use shall also serve the best interest of the community&quot;. The proposal for the constitution had been prepared by Hugo Preuss, a former student of Gierke.

Gierke remained a committed nationalist throughout his life. He was deeply disappointed about Germany&#x27;s military defeat in World War I and the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In May 1919 at the age of seventy-eight Gierke rallied his academic colleagues to build a new Germany based on Germanic traditions: &quot;We are a people, with thousands of years of history&quot;. Gierke recapitulated his vision for the new parliamentary republic as a state based on &quot;national identity&quot; and with &quot;historical foundation&quot;. He declared that the state in Germany should remain an organically built community along Germanic traditions, where municipalities and local governments are autonomous and derive their legal existence from the association of citizens. He continued: &quot;It should be a welfare state. Social but not socialist!&quot;. To this end, the German state should remain a cultured state subject to the rule of law. In what would become his last public lecture, Gierke set out the principles that were to infuse the constitutional law of the fledgling Weimar Republic.

==Influence on pluralism==
In Britain, interest in Gierke&#x27;s views were generated when the British historian of law Frederic William Maitland published a partial translation of Gierke&#x27;s 1881 four volume opus on the German law of association (&quot;Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht&quot;) under the title &quot;Political Theories of the Middle Ages&quot; in 1900.

==Social law==
Rudolf von Jhering and Gierke have been recognized as forerunners of social law, which overcame the classical division of public law and private law. Social jurists argued that the norm of property, contract and tort should not govern all aspects of commercial and private interactions. By arguing that legal principles such as &quot;freedom of contract&quot; or &quot;liability for injury&quot; point to certain purposes which a legal system imposes on the social world, Gierke laid the theoretical foundations for substantial areas of social life to be regulated by social laws, such as corporate law, competition law, labour law and housing law.

==Commercial Law==
Gierke is well-known for his academic work on Commercial Law. Especially, he conducted research in the German Law of Association (&quot;Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht&quot;).

==Children==
His son Edgar von Gierke was a highly respected pathologist who discovered glycogen storage disease type I in 1929.

Gierke&#x27;s oldest daughter Anna was among the first group of women elected to parliament in Germany in 1919.

<doc id="1183598" wikidata="Q953219" url="?curid=1183598" title="Protocooperation">
<text>Protocooperation is where two species interact with each other beneficially; they have no need to interact with each other - they interact purely for the gain that they receive from doing this. It is not at all necessary for protocooperation to occur; growth and survival is possible in the absence of the interaction. The interaction that occurs can be between different kingdoms.

The term, initially used for intraspecific interactions, was popularized by Eugene Odum (1953), although other authors prefer to use the terms &quot;cooperation&quot; or &quot;mutualism&quot;.

==Mutualism==

Protocooperation is a form of mutualism, but the cooperating species do not depend on each other for survival. An example of protocooperation happens between soil bacteria or fungi, and the plants that occur growing in the soil. None of the species rely on the relationship for survival, but all of the fungi, bacteria and higher plants take part in shaping soil composition and fertility. Soil bacteria and fungi interrelate with each other, forming nutrients essential to the plants survival. The plants obtain nutrients from root nodules and decomposing organic substance. Plants benefit by getting essential mineral nutrients and carbon dioxide. The plants do not need these mineral nutrients but do help the plant grow even further.

==Examples==

===Ants and aphids===

A further example of protocooperation is the connection between ants and aphids. The ant searches for food on trees and shrubs that are hosts to honeydew-secreting species such as aphids, mealybugs, and some scales. The ant gathers the sugary substance and takes it to its nest as food for its offspring. Ants have been known to stimulate aphids to secrete honeydew straight into their mouth. Some ant species even look after the honeydew producers from natural predators. In areas where the ant inhabited the same ecosystem as the aphid, the plants they inhabit normally suffer from a higher presence of aphids which is detrimental to the plant but not to the two species protocooperating.

===Flowers and insects===
The flowers of plants that are pollinated by insects and birds benefit from protocooperation. The plants, particularly those with large bright colourful flowers bearing nectar glands, experience cross pollination because of the insects activities. This is beneficial to the insect that has got the food supply of pollen and nectar required for its survival.

===Birds===
Protocooperation can occur in birds. The Egyptian plover removes insect pests from the backs of buffalo, antelope, giraffes, and rhinos. The cattle egret in America as well does the same task of removing the unwanted insects and parasites.

===Fish===
Certain fish perform the task of cleaning other fish, by removing ectoparasites, cleaning wounded flesh, and getting rid of dead flesh. Even predatory fish rely on cleansing symbionts, and adopt a placid state while they are cleansed. The fish that do the cleansing are often concentrated around specific sites where the other fish come to be cleansed. These are known as cleansing stations.

=== Bacteria ===
Prominently exhibited between &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp Bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophillus&quot;, the two symbiotic starter bacteria commonly used in yoghurt starter culture. &quot;S. thermophilus&quot; produces pyruvic acid, formic acid, folic acid, ornithine, long-chain fatty acids, and which stimulates the growth of &quot;L. bulgaricus.&quot; The acid lowers the pH of the milk to an optimal level for &quot;L. bulgaricus. L. bulgaricus&quot; produces peptides, free amino acids, and putrescine through proteolysis, which stimulate the growth of &quot;S. thermophilus.&quot;

<text>Alexander George is an American philosopher working as a professor of philosophy at Amherst College. 

== Career ==
Born and raised in Manhattan, George attended Lycée Français de New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979 from Columbia College and his Master of Arts and PhD from Harvard University in 1981 and 1986, respectively. George was a junior research fellow at New College and Wolfson College, Oxford University. In 2001, he received an honorary A.M. from Amherst College.

== Career ==
George&#x27;s research interests include philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and the history of analytic philosophy.

George is the founder of AskPhilosophers.org, a website that allows visitors to submit philosophical questions to a panel of professors of philosophy. The site was launched on October 1, 2005. As of October 2010, there have been over 3,250 questions posted and over 4,200 responses. The questions have come from people of all ages and all walks of life, from countries around the world. The purpose of the website is to put the skills of trained philosophers at the service of the public, thereby helping to bridge the gap between the philosophical questions people encounter in everyday life and the answers and ideas that philosophers have come up with over the past 2,500 years. A book of selected questions and answers from the site, &quot;What Would Socrates Say?&quot;, has been published in many countries.

Alex George&#x27;s interest in chess problems led him to start the internet forum ChessProblem.net. He has also composed some retroanalytical compositions. With fellow Amherst professor Lawrence Douglas, Professor George publishes humorous pieces in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; and other publications. &quot;Sense and Nonsensibility&quot; (), a book that pokes gentle fun at the worlds of literature and academia, appeared in 2004.

<doc id="1183610" wikidata="Q6848783" url="?curid=1183610" title="Mike Sharperson">
<text>Michael Tyrone Sharperson (October 4, 1961 – May 26, 1996) was an American infielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1987), Los Angeles Dodgers (1987–1993) and Atlanta Braves (1995). Sharperson batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

In an eight-season career, Sharperson posted a .280 batting average with 10 home runs and 123 RBI in 557 games.

==Career==
Sharperson was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the first round (11th pick) of the 1981 amateur draft. He made his debut with Toronto in 1987 and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in midseason.
A member of the Dodgers&#x27; 1988 World Series championship team, Sharperson was part of the group of utility players known as &quot;The Stunt Men&quot;, for their ability to play many different positions and roles. While mostly used at third base and second, Sharperson also played shortstop, first base and right field.

In 1990, Sharperson hit .297 with career-highs in hits (106) and games (129). His most productive season came in 1992, when he hit .300 with 21 doubles and 48 runs (all career-highs), and made the National League All-Star team.

Released by the Dodgers before the 1994 season, Sharperson signed with the Red Sox, then with the Cubs, but did not play for them. He appeared in seven games with the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and became a free agent at the end of the season. He then signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres.

==Death==
In 1996, Sharperson was playing for the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars. He was driving to McCarran International Airport to join the Padres in Montreal against the Expos after being recalled when he died in a one-car crash at the junction of I-15 and I-215 just south of the Las Vegas Strip. He was southbound on I-15 at about 2:45 a.m. when he apparently realized he missed his turn onto I-215. A witness said that Sharperson tried to make a right turn onto I-215, but lost control in the rain and went into a dirt median. Local law enforcement who arrived at the scene of the accident stated that Sharperson had been ejected through his car&#x27;s sunroof during the accident. He was 34 years old.

<text>Garry William Beers (born 22 June 1957), known as Garry Gary Beers, is an Australian musician and was the bass guitarist for the rock group INXS.

==Career==
Garry William Beers was born to Lola (died 2011) and William Beers. William Beers was a front-end loader operator, and Lola worked part-time in a variety of jobs. Garry has an older sister, Kerry. He grew up in the Sydney suburb of Manly and attended The Forest High School. His first band was Legolas Elvin Warrior in 1975, where he played acoustic guitar with school mates, Bill Hucker and Glen Fender.

After nine months of studying acoustic guitar with little improvement, Beers moved over to bass guitar but refused to take further lessons. His inspiration was John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, James Jamerson, and Paul McCartney. He met Andrew Farriss and they formed the band Dr Dolphin, which was followed by the Farriss Brothers in 1977. Farriss Brothers became INXS in 1979 with Beers on bass guitar and double bass, Andrew Farriss on keyboards and guitar, Jon Farriss on drums and keyboards, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar, saxophone and backing vocals. Generally playing bass guitar, Beers&#x27; double bass work occurs on some INXS tracks including &quot;By My Side&quot;.

In 1989, while on hiatus from INXS, he joined Absent Friends as bass guitarist. Their No. 7 album, &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking Up Your Address&quot; (May 1990) spawned the No. 4 hit single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Be With Nobody But You&quot;. He also plays the guitar, keyboards, ukulele, and is adept at computer programming for song writing and music production. Beers has co-written tracks for INXS including &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. From 2008, Beers has been concentrating on his song writing in Los Angeles, as well as the INXS album, &quot;Original Sin&quot; released on 8 November 2010.

He co-wrote the song &quot;Tangle With Your Mind&quot; with Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots for Weiland&#x27;s solo CD &quot;Happy in Galoshes&quot; (2008). In late 2015, Beers formed a new band called Stadium with Irish singer Ciaran Gribbin who was the lead singer for INXS when they announced their retirement from live performance at the end of 2012.


==Personal life==

Beers was given his double name at school. It was later misprinted on the cover of INXS&#x27; 1980 debut album, &quot;INXS&quot;, as Garry Gary Beers. Very rarely given as Gary, Beers adopted the alternative spelling, which appears on merchandise and personal items such as guitar picks.

Garry and Jourdan Beers married in September 2007. They live in Los Angeles and enjoy volunteering for several animal rescue organisations. They have twins. Beers also has two daughters from his first marriage to Jodie Crampton, and a son from his short relationship with Shelley Preston.

<text>Political culture describes how culture impacts politics. Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.
Political culture is what the people, the voters, the electorates believe and do based on their understanding of the political system in which they have found themselves. These may be regarded as being bad or good placed side by side with global best practices or norms.

== Definition ==
Gabriel Almond defines it as &quot;the particular pattern of orientations toward political actions in which every political system is embedded&quot;.

Lucian Pye&#x27;s definition is that &quot;Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system&quot;.

María Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as &quot;the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake.&quot;

== Analysis ==
The limits of a particular political culture are based on subjective identity. The most common form of such identity today is the national identity, and hence nation states set the typical limits of political cultures. The socio-cultural system, in turn, gives meaning to a political culture through shared symbols and rituals (such as a national independence day) which reflect common values. This may develop into a civil religion. The values themselves can be more hierarchical or egalitarian, and will set the limits to political participation, thereby creating a basis for legitimacy. They are transmitted through socialization, and shaped by shared historical experiences which form the collective or national memory. Intellectuals will continue to interpret the political culture through political discourse in the public sphere. Indeed, elite political culture is more consequential than mass-level.

=== Elements ===
Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function. Postmaterialism is the degree to which political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism. Religion has also an impact on political culture.

==Classifications==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed.

=== Almond &amp; Verba ===
Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba in &quot;The Civic Culture&quot; outlined three pure types of political culture based on level and type of political participation and the nature of people&#x27;s attitudes toward politics:
* Parochial – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the &quot;downward flow&quot; side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the civic culture, which mixes the best elements of each.

=== Elazar ===
Daniel J. Elazar identified three kinds of political culture:

* Individualistic culture – In which politics is a marketplace between individuals seeking to maximize their self-interest, with minimal community involvement and opposition to the government, as well as a high degree of patronage. &quot;See also:&quot; Neopatrimonialism.
* Moralistic culture – Whereby government is seen as important and as a way to improve peoples&#x27; lives.
* Traditionalistic culture – One which seeks to preserve the status quo under which elites have all the power and citizen participation is not expected.

=== Huntington ===

Samuel P. Huntington classified political cultures according to civilizations on the basis of geography and history:

* Western civilization
* Japanese civilization
* Islamic civilization
* Hindu civilization
* Slavic-Orthodox civilization
* Latin American civilization
* Chinese civilization
* African civilization

=== Inglehart ===
Ronald Inglehart proposes that political culture can dictate political systems, and points out a correlation between Protestantism (or more generally societies with high Secular-Rational values and high Self Expression values on the Inglehart-Weltzel values map) and stable democratization. However, the recurrent post-elections clashes in largely protestant Sub-Saharan countries, such as Kenya or Uganda, shows that religious affiliations seem to poorly affect the political behaviour of populations.

== National political cultures ==

=== Russia ===
Russia is a low-trust society, with even the highest trusted institutions of church and the military having more distrustful than trusting citizens, and with low participation in civil society. This means that Russia has a weak civic political culture. Furthermore, the authoritarian traditions of Russia mean that there is little support for democratic norms such as tolerance of dissent and pluralism. Russia has a history of authoritarian rulers from Ivan the Terrible to Joseph Stalin, who have engaged in massive repression of all potential political competitors, from the oprichnina to the Great Purge. The resulting political systems of Tsarist autocracy and Soviet communism had no space for independent institutions.

=== United States ===
The political culture of the United States was heavily influenced by the background of its early immigrants, as it is a settler society. Samuel P. Huntington identified American politics as having a &quot;Tudor&quot; character, with elements of English political culture of that period, such as common law, strong courts, local self-rule, decentralized sovereignty across institutions, and reliance on popular militias instead of a standing army, having been imported by early settlers. Another source of political culture was the arrival of Scotch-Irish Americans, who came from a violent region of Britain, and brought with them a strong sense of individualism and support for the right to bear arms. These settlers provided the support for Jacksonian democracy, which was a revolution of its time against the established elites, and remnants of which can still be seen in modern American populism.

=== China ===
The political culture of China is tied closely to political socialization, as children are indoctrinated into the collectivist perspective of the Chinese Communist Party. This inculcation is theorized to explain the delayed growth of secularism in Chinese culture, especially during the Cultural Revolution. Chinese political culture perceives the relationship between government and individuals to be a hierarchy. Because of this, there is little pushback from individuals during policy and regulation change. The political culture also shows a trend against confrontationality, which decreases the quantity and frequency of social conflict. Both of these qualities stem from traditional Chinese values embedded during the age of Confucianism. When the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1948, Mao Zedong unsuccessfully attempted to remove these traits from the culture, instead opting for revolutionary values and priorities.

=== India ===
Due to India&#x27;s colonization by the British Empire, the contemporary political culture has been influenced by western ideas that were not present before , so we also follow western political culture .These influences include democracy and parliamentary systems, two institutions that stood ideologically opposite of the caste system that dictated society before. Because of India&#x27;s multicultural demography, the political culture varies by group and region. India&#x27;s successful democratization lead to power being given to both the urbanized and well-educated class who focused on national appeal, as well as more traditional, rural, and lower class political actors. In the modern era, the class system of India has begun to break down, and members of lower classes are now entering higher political and economic positions. This is especially true for lower class women, who historically have been excluded from such activities.

<doc id="1183636" wikidata="Q1738188" url="?curid=1183636" title="Battle of Abydos">
<text>The Battle of Abydos was an Athenian naval victory in the Peloponnesian War. In the battle, the Spartan fleet, under Mindarus, attempted to rescue a small allied fleet that had been driven ashore at Dardanus, but was attacked by the Athenian fleet, under Thrasybulus. The fighting was evenly contested for a great length of time, but towards evening, the arrival of Alcibiades with Athenian reinforcements tipped the balance in favor of the Athenians, and the Peloponnesians were forced to flee back to their base at Abydos, suffering heavy losses along the way.

==Prelude==
After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, the Athenian fleet established a base at Sestos, from where it could quickly respond to any moves by the Spartan fleet at Abydos. Mindarus, the Spartan navarch, summoned the Rhodian commander Dorieus, with his 14 ships, to join him at Abydos, hoping to end the war with a decisive victory. Dorieus, accordingly, sailed north from Rhodes towards the Hellespont. Before reaching Abydos, however, he was spotted by Athenian lookouts and driven ashore. Xenophon reports that he was trapped at Rhoeteum, while Diodorus Siculus reports the location as Dardanus; Donald Kagan suggests that Dorieus was driven ashore at Rhoeteum, then managed to advance a little farther towards Abydos before being trapped a second time at Dardanus.

Learning of Dorieus&#x27;s plight, Mindarus hurried from Troy, where he had been sacrificing to Athena, to Abydos, while Pharnabazus brought his army up to support Dorieus from the land. Mindarus led his ships out from Abydos to rescue Dorieus; the Athenians, observing this, set out from Sestos to challenge him.

==Battle==
Mindarus, after joining forces with Dorieus, had 97 ships under his command; the Athenian fleet contained 74 ships. The Spartans lined up for battle with the Asian shore of the Hellespont at their backs, with Mindarus commanding the right and the Syracusans holding the left; the Athenians lined up opposite them, with Thrasybulus commanding the right and Thrasyllus the left. The battle began with a signal from the commanders, which was relayed to the fleet by trumpeters. An evenly matched fight ensued, with pilots attempting to ram and disable enemy triremes, while marines on the decks engaged their opposite numbers whenever they came within range of an opposing ship. As the day wore on, neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage until Alcibiades appeared with 18 triremes from Samos. Initially, both fleets believed that the reinforcements might be theirs, but as Alcibiades drew nearer he ran up a red flag, a prearranged signal that told the Athenians the ships were their own. Realizing this, the Spartan fleet fled to Abydos, but suffered heavy losses along the way, as the Athenians attacked the strung out ships. All told, the Athenians captured 30 Spartan ships and recovered the 15 of their own that the Spartans had taken at the Battle of Cynossema.

==Aftermath==
In the wake of this serious defeat, Mindarus and the Spartan fleet returned to Abydos to repair and rebuild; Mindarus sent to Sparta for reinforcements and, with Pharnabazus, planned for future campaigns. The Athenians, meanwhile, were unable to press the advantage they had gained. With their treasury low and a crisis ongoing at Euboea, which was in revolt, the Athenians were unable to keep their entire fleet in the Hellespont, and instead dispatched 30 ships under Theramenes to attack the rebels on Euboea. Although unable to prevent the rebels from building a causeway to Boeotia, he did succeed in raising a substantial amount of money by plundering hostile territory in Euboea, Boeotia, and the Aegean.

Shortly after the battle, the satrap Tissaphernes arrived from Ionia. Alcibiades, who had served as Tissaphernes&#x27; assistant for a time and wished to demonstrate that he was influential with the satrap, sailed to meet him, bringing gifts. It turned out, however, that Alcibiades had misjudged the situation. The Spartans had complained to the Persian king about the tepid support they had received from Tissaphernes, and the satrap, needing to demonstrate his commitment to opposing actions, arrested Alcibiades and imprisoned him at Sardis. Alcibiades escaped within a month, but his claims of influence with Tissaphernes were destroyed.

<doc id="1183638" wikidata="Q47583" url="?curid=1183638" title="Gianfranco Fini">
<text>Gianfranco Fini (born 3 January 1952) is a retired Italian politician who served as the president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 2008 to 2013 and Deputy Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006. He is the former leader of the far-right Italian Social Movement, the conservative National Alliance, and the center-right Future and Freedom party. He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government from 2001 to 2006.

==Biography==

===Family origins===
Fini was born on 3 January 1952 in Bologna. His grandfather, a communist activist, died in 1970. His father, Argenio &quot;Sergio&quot; Fini (Bologna, 1923 – Rome, 1998), was a volunteer with the Italian Social Republic, a fascist state in Northern Italy allied with Germany during 1943–45; he later declared feeling close to the centre-left Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PDSI), but withdrew from political activity after his son became involved in the Italian Social Movement (MSI).

His mother Erminia Marani (Ferrara, 1926 – Rome, 2008) was the daughter of Antonio Marani, who took part along with Italo Balbo in the march on Rome, which signalled the beginning of Italian fascism in 1922. The name Gianfranco was chosen in remembrance of a cousin, who was killed when he was 20 years old by partisans soon after the liberation of Northern Italy on 25 April 1945.

===Personal events===
In the 1980s, he met Daniela Di Sotto, at that time married to Sergio Mariani, a friend and party officer. Di Sotto ended her marriage to stay with Fini. Mariani would try to kill himself soon after. In 1985 they had their only daughter, Giuliana. Fini and Di Sotto married in a civil ceremony in Marino in 1988. They separated in 2007.

Five months after his separation, his relationship with Elisabetta Tulliani, a lawyer, was revealed. In December 2007, they had a daughter, Carolina. Their second daughter is called Martina.

==Political career==

===From the beginning to the role of Deputy of Giorgio Almirante===
Fini attended &quot;Laura Bassi&quot; high school in Bologna. His first known involvement with politics occurred in 1968, when the 16-year-old Fini was involved in clashes with communist activists, among them a protest in front of a cinema against the screening of the John Wayne movie &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. At this time, he became involved with the Italian Social Movement.
He then began his political career in the Youth Front, the MSI youth organization. Three years later, he moved with his family to Rome. In August 1976 he served his military service in Savona, then in Rome at the Ministry of Defence. In 1977 he became national secretary of the Youth Front, chosen by Giorgio Almirante, secretary of the party that now called itself &quot;MSI - Destra Nazionale&quot;. Fini had placed fifth among seven candidates elected in the national secretariat of the youth.

In the meantime, Fini had also graduated with a degree in pedagogy from La Sapienza University in Rome. He also collaborated with the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Il Secolo d&#x27;Italia&quot;, along with the youth movement magazine &quot;Dissenso&quot;.

Fini was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies on 26 June 1983 as a member of the MSI. Re-elected in 1987, in September he was nominated by Almirante to be his successor as the party&#x27;s secretary.

In 2009 it emerged that as early as 1980 Almirante had identified Fini as one among a group of young Italians who were &quot;young, non-fascist, non-nostalgic, who believe, as I do by now, in these institutions, in this Constitution. Because only in this way the MSI can have a future.&quot;

===From the Italian Social Movement to National Alliance===
Giorgio Almirante died in May 1988, and at the party&#x27;s congress in Sorrento that year, Fini defeated the right wing of the party, headed by Pino Rauti, and was elected party secretary. He remained in the national secretariat of the MSI until January 1990, when at the next party congress in Rimini, Pino Rauti was elected secretary. But in July 1991, after a tough electoral defeat in administrative and regional elections in Sicily, Fini returned to his role as party secretary. He held this post until the dissolution of party in 1995.
During his time as national secretary, he confirmed the MSI&#x27;s role as the inheritors of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist legacy with a number of famous polemical statements, including: &quot;Dear comrades, MSI claims its right to refer to fascism&quot; (1988), &quot;We are fascists, the heirs of fascism, the fascism of the year 2000&quot; (1991), &quot;After almost half a century, the idea of fascism is alive&quot; (1992), &quot;There are phases where freedom is not among the key values&quot; (1994), &quot;Mussolini was the greatest Italian statesman of the twentieth century&quot;, &quot;Fascism has a tradition of honesty, correctness and good government&quot; (1994).

In the autumn of 1993, Fini ran for mayor of Rome, garnering enough votes to participate in a runoff election that resulted in the victory of Francesco Rutelli. Nevertheless, for the first time an MSI candidate received significant support in a major election. Silvio Berlusconi, then an entrepreneur but not involved in politics, affirmed on that occasion his preference for Fini: &quot;If I had to vote in Rome, my preference would go to Fini.

After Berlusconi&#x27;s election in 1994, for the first time in Italy&#x27;s political history, an Italian government included four ministers from the MSI party, including the Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella, although Fini did not directly take part as a minister. (Fini was not a minister at that time.)

During the 1990s Fini gradually began to move the MSI away from its neo-fascist ideology to a more traditionally conservative political agenda. In January 1995, the Party&#x27;s congress in Fiuggi marked a radical change, afterwards referred to as &quot;la svolta di Fiuggi&quot; (the turning point at Fiuggi) and merged the MSI with conservative elements of the disbanded Christian Democrats to form the National Alliance (AN), of which Fini assumed the presidency.

The new party took a decisive stance distancing itself from fascism. After the House of Freedoms&#x27; 1994 victory, Fini said there would not and could not be any return to fascism and frequently disavowed AN supporters who used the fascist salute. Some MSI members (Pino Rauti, Erra, Staiti) dissented and seceded to form the new Tricolor Flame party.

===Government experiences===
Fini and his party have been part of Berlusconi&#x27;s right-wing House of Freedoms coalition which won the 1994 and 2001 parliamentary election. Fini became deputy prime minister in 2001 and foreign minister in November 2004.

From February 2002 to 2006, he represented the Italian Government at the European Convention. Following the April 2008 general election, Fini was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies on 30 April 2008 on the fourth ballot, receiving 355 votes.

His most widely known legislative acts have been:
* The &quot;Bossi-Fini Act&quot;, a restrictive law on immigration;
* The &quot;Fini-Giovanardi Act&quot; (2006), a restrictive law on drugs. The act abolishes any distinction between soft drugs (cannabis) and hard drugs (heroin, cocaine), punishing the user on the base of the quantity of active ingredient in the dose. As administrative sanctions, personal use of drugs is punished with a fine and the suspension of passport, driving license and/or weapon carrying permit. The cultivation of a single plant is punished with 1 up to 6 years of imprisonment.

===From National Alliance to the People of Freedom===

After some discord between the party&#x27;s factions in 2005, a congress dismantled the factions and confirmed Fini as president of the party.

In 2006, Fini announced the removal of the symbol of the flame and of the &quot;M.S.I.&quot; writing from AN symbol. The move, after facing opposition from party members such as Maurizio Gasparri was finally denied.

Fini began a personal evolution towards more socially liberal positions in the 2000s, notwithstanding the opposition of the rest of his party. In particular:
* in 2005 he announced a positive vote (three yes, one no) on a referendum on artificial insemination aimed at removing some limits introduced by the Act n.40/2004 of the same Berlusconi II Cabinet.
* in December 2006 he declared he would be in favour of public acknowledgement of civil unions, including homosexual ones, although nonetheless in opposition to the centre-left government proposed bill on the theme.

At the end of January 2007, Berlusconi declared that Fini would be his only successor in case of unification of centre-right parties, provoking dissent from the Northern League and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC).

In 2007 Berlusconi proclaimed the dissolution of his party and the birth of a new unitary party of the centre-right, the People of Freedom. At first, Fini reacted coldly, affirming that AN would not participate, judging the way the new party was born confused and superficial, and expressing open dissent against his ally of the &quot;former coalition&quot;.

However, two months later, he moved closer to Berlusconi again, soon after the fall of the Prodi II Cabinet. They agreed to present the two parties under the same symbol of the People of Freedom in the April 2008 parliamentary election, and then to proceed towards a unitary centre-right party.

===President of the Chamber of Deputies===

After the electoral victory, on 30 April 2008 after four rounds of voting, Fini was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, with 335 votes from a total of 611. He then resigned the presidency of AN in anticipation of unification with the new People of Freedom party. Within this new party, Fini became seen as Berlusconi&#x27;s &quot;heir apparent&quot;.

Commenting on the homage to every victim of terrorism made by the President of the Republic, the former member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) Giorgio Napolitano, he announced &quot;the end of the post-war period&quot;, of &quot;the cleavage between the right and society&quot;, and of &quot;overcoming minority status&quot;.

Pursuing his path of revision of the values of the Italian right, at the 2008 youth fest &quot;Atreju 2008&quot; he asserted that the Right has to acknowledge those rights &quot;present in the Constitution: freedom, equality and social justice. Values that determined and still determine the path of the Right, that are values of any democracy and that are fully anti-fascist&quot;.

In his role of Speaker of the Chamber, he more than once rebuked the government, criticising their extensive use of the confidence votes. He was considered a moderating force between Berlusconi&#x27;s government and the President of the Republic, eventually suggesting that Berlusconi should step down.

He fought against the bad practices of absenteeism and double-voting by MPs in the Italian Parliament, promoting a digital voting system (to be implemented from March 2009) to prevent other MPs from voting on behalf of absent members, judging it &quot;immoral&quot; 19 MPs out of a total of 630 refused, however, to allow their fingerprints to be recorded, and the system was implemented on a voluntary basis.

He also negatively judged the desire of the Berlusconi government to intervene with a decree in the case of Eluana Englaro and supported the need to defend the secularism of the State, being then criticized by members of UDC and of his own party. In recent times he has become more and more vocally critical of the government platform, which he considers too biased towards the far-right federalist coalition party . This has brought him into conflict with Berlusconi himself.

He founded the parliamentarian group &quot;Futuro e libertà per l&#x27;Italia&quot; (Future and Freedom for Italy) in hopes of establishing a centrist &quot;third pole&quot;, similar to what Pier Ferdinando Casini had done with the Union of the Centre. In the 2013 Italian general election, the FLI (Future and Freedom for Italy) received only 0.5% of the vote and thus was awarded no seats in the Chamber of Deputies, ending Fini&#x27;s 30 year parliamentary career. After the electoral defeat, Fini retired from politics.

==Controversies==

The strongest criticisms of Fini from the right are related to moves away from the traditional policies of the party. Apart from the Social Right area of his traditional rival Pino Rauti, the right-wing intellectual Marcello Veneziani accused Fini of having lost any connection to right-wing thought (whether traditional, nostalgic, modern, or conservative) and of representing an astral right, with no similarity to any other European right-wing group.

Further criticism of Fini came from with respect to some aspects of federalism and immigration, and from regarding justice.

Fini has lately been accused of being incoherent by some theo-con members for holding socially conservative political positions while at the same time being separated and never married in Church.
* In 1999, Fini asked for forced hospitalization of drug users, without distinction between different illegal drugs.
* On 13 October 2004, he said that &quot;Istria, Fiume (Rijeka) and Dalmatia are Italian land&quot; and that Croatia is against national minorities.
* On 29 January 2006, after Senate approval of the Fini-sponsored drug bill which strengthened the law against marijuana and promoted it to a class 1 drug, putting it in the same category as heroin and cocaine, giving dealers the same penalty as dealers in hard drugs and users the same fines for consumption, Fini, as a guest on the popular TV-Show &quot;Che tempo che fa&quot;, hosted by Fabio Fazio, admitted to having smoked marijuana while on vacation in Jamaica.
* In May 2008, he sparked outrage when he said that the burning of an Israeli flag was much worse than the murder of a 29-year-old man in Verona, savagely beaten to death by a local group of skinheads.
* He ignited controversy when he stated that the racial laws were not the sole responsibility of the Fascist regime, but also that Italian civil society and the Roman Catholic Church had to have their share of the blame as well.
* At a press conference to the Foreign Press Association, he was asked for his thoughts on Benito Mussolini. A journalist reminded him that 15 years earlier he had called the dictator the greatest statesman of the century. Fini replied: &quot;I&#x27;m fascinated by your question. ... clearly the answer is in what I&#x27;ve done in the past 15 years. Today my answer is no, I have changed my mind, otherwise I would be schizophrenic.&quot;
* In August 2010, after becoming a leading critic of Berlusconi and threatening Berlusconi&#x27;s majority in parliament, a newspaper owned by the Berlusconi family implicated Fini with a condominium in Monte Carlo. The condo was previously owned by the National Alliance political party. The party sold the condo in 2008 to an offshore company and it was leased back to the younger brother of Fini&#x27;s girlfriend. Elisabetta Tulliani, the partner of Fini, is now under investigation by magistrates in Rome for money laundering because of a bank transfer of 739.000 euros related to the sale of the Montecarlo condo. The magistrates found documentary evidence that Elisabetta and her brother Giancarlo were the real owners of the offshore companies that leased the condo, and afterwards sold it. Fini said he was &quot;a dork (&quot;coglione&quot;) but never a corrupt man&quot;, because he did not notice that the condo was owned and sold by his girlfriend. In April 2024, Fini was convicted and sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment for his role in the sale.

<doc id="1183639" wikidata="Q788099" url="?curid=1183639" title="Laurel forest">
<text>Laurel forest, also called laurisilva or laurissilva, is a type of subtropical forest found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable, mild temperatures. The forest is characterized by broadleaf tree species with evergreen, glossy and leaves, known as &quot;laurophyll&quot; or &quot;lauroid&quot;. Plants from the laurel family (Lauraceae) may or may not be present, depending on the location.

== Ecology ==
Laurel and laurophyll forests have a patchy distribution in warm temperate regions, often occupying topographic refugia where the moisture from the ocean condenses so that it falls as rain or fog and soils have high moisture levels. They have a mild climate, seldom exposed to fires or frosts and are found in relatively acidic soils. Primary productivity is high, but can be limited by mild summer drought. The canopies are evergreen, dominated by species with glossy- or leathery-leaves, and with moderate tree diversity. Insects are the most important herbivores, but birds and bats are the predominant seed-dispersers and pollinators. Decomposers such as invertebrates, fungi, and microbes on the forest floor are critical to nutrient cycling.

These conditions of temperature and moisture occur in four different geographical regions:
* Along the eastern margin of continents at latitudes of 25° to 35°.
* Along the western coast of continents between 35° and 50° latitude.
* On islands between 25° and 35° or 40° latitude.
* In humid montane regions of the tropics.

Some laurel forests are a type of cloud forest. Cloud forests are found on mountain slopes where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean is precipitated as warm moist air masses blowing off the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the dew point. The moisture in the air condenses as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions in the air and soil. The resulting climate is wet and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean.

== Characteristics ==
Laurel forests are characterized by evergreen and hardwood trees, reaching up to in height. Laurel forest, laurisilva, and laurissilva all refer to plant communities that resemble the bay laurel.

Some species belong to the true laurel family, Lauraceae, but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to convergent evolution. As in any other rainforest, plants of the laurel forests must adapt to high rainfall and humidity. The trees have adapted in response to these ecological drivers by developing analogous structures, leaves that repel water. Laurophyll or lauroid leaves are characterized by a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an &quot;apical mucro&quot; or &quot;drip tip&quot;, which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing respiration. The scientific names &quot;laurina&quot;, &quot;laurifolia&quot;, &quot;laurophylla&quot;, &quot;lauriformis&quot;, and &quot;lauroides&quot; are often used to name species of other plant families that resemble the Lauraceae. The term &quot;Lucidophyll&quot;, referring to the shiny surface of the leaves, was proposed in 1969 by Tatuo Kira. The scientific names &quot;Daphnidium&quot;, &quot;Daphniphyllum&quot;, &quot;Daphnopsis&quot;, &quot;Daphnandra&quot;, &quot;Daphne&quot; from Greek: Δάφνη, meaning &quot;laurel&quot;, &quot;laurus&quot;, &quot;Laureliopsis&quot;, &quot;laureola&quot;, &quot;laurelin&quot;, &quot;laurifolia&quot;, &quot;laurifolius&quot;, &quot;lauriformis&quot;, &quot;laurina&quot;, &quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; (cherry laurel), &quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot; (Portugal laurel), &quot;Corynocarpus laevigatus&quot; (New Zealand Laurel), and &quot;Corynocarpus rupestris&quot; designate species of other plant families whose leaves resemble Lauraceae. The term &quot;lauroid&quot; is also applied to climbing plants such as ivies, whose waxy leaves somewhat resemble those of the Lauraceae.

Mature laurel forests typically have a dense tree canopy and low light levels at the forest floor. Some forests are characterized by an overstory of emergent trees.

Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented. In the absence of strong environmental selective pressure, the number of species sharing the arboreal stratum is high, although not reaching the diversity of tropical forests; nearly 100 tree species have been described in the laurisilva rainforest of Misiones (Argentina), about 20 in the Canary Islands. This species diversity contrasts with other temperate forest types, which typically have a canopy dominated by one or a few species. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics. In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.

== Origin ==
Laurel forests are composed of vascular plants that evolved millions of years ago. Lauroid floras have included forests of Podocarpaceae and southern beech.

This type of vegetation characterized parts of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana and once covered much of the tropics. Some lauroid species that are found outside laurel forests are relicts of vegetation that covered much of the mainland of Australia, Europe, South America, Antarctica, Africa, and North America when their climate was warmer and more humid. Cloud forests are believed to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet conditions were replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the late Cretaceous – early Tertiary Gondwanan species of flora became extinct, but some survived as relict species in the milder, moister climate of coastal areas and on islands. Thus Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct on the Australian mainland, and the same case occurs on the Macaronesia islands of the Atlantic and on the Taiwan, Hainan, Jeju, Shikoku, Kyūshū, and Ryūkyū Islands of the Pacific.

Although some remnants of archaic flora, including species and genera extinct in the rest of the world, have persisted as endemic to such coastal mountain and shelter sites, their biodiversity was reduced. Isolation in these fragmented habitats, particularly on islands, has led to the development of vicariant species and genera. Thus, fossils dating from before the Pleistocene glaciations show that species of &quot;Laurus&quot; were formerly distributed more widely around the Mediterranean and North Africa. Isolation gave rise to &quot;Laurus azorica&quot; in the Azores Islands, &quot;Laurus nobilis&quot; on the mainland, and &quot;Laurus novocanariensis&quot; in the Madeira and the Canary Islands.

== Ecoregions ==
Laurel forests occur in small areas where their particular climatic requirements prevail, in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Inner laurel forest ecoregions, a related and distinct community of vascular plants, evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of Gondwana, and species of this community are now found in several separate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including southern South America, southernmost Africa, New Zealand, Australia and New Caledonia. Most Laurel forest species are evergreen, and occur in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate regions and cloud forests of the northern and southern hemispheres, in particular the Macaronesian islands, southern Japan, Madagascar, New Caledonia, Tasmania, and central Chile, but they are pantropical, and for example in Africa they are endemic to the Congo region, Cameroon, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, in lowland forest and Afromontane areas.
Since laurel forests are archaic populations that diversified as a result of isolation on islands and tropical mountains, their presence is a key to dating climatic history.

=== East Asia ===

Laurel forests are common in subtropical eastern Asia, and form the climax vegetation in far southern Japan, Taiwan, southern China, the mountains of Indochina, and the eastern Himalayas. In southern China, laurel forest once extended throughout the Yangtze Valley and Sichuan Basin from the East China Sea to the Tibetan Plateau. The northernmost laurel forests in East Asia occur at 39° N. on the Pacific coast of Japan. Altitudinally, the forests range from sea-level up to 1000 metres in warm-temperate Japan, and up to 3000 metres elevation in the subtropical mountains of Asia. Some forests are dominated by Lauraceae, while in others evergreen laurophyll trees of the beech family (Fagaceae) are predominant, including ring-cupped oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; subgenus &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot;), chinquapin (&quot;Castanopsis&quot;) and tanoak (&quot;Lithocarpus&quot;). Other characteristic plants include &quot;Schima&quot; and &quot;Camellia&quot;, which are members of the tea family (Theaceae), as well as magnolias, bamboo, and rhododendrons. These subtropical forests lie between the temperate deciduous and conifer forests to the north and the subtropical/tropical monsoon forests of Indochina and India to the south.

Associations of Lauraceous species are common in broadleaved forests; for example, &quot;Litsea&quot; spp., &quot;Persea odoratissima, Persea duthiei,&quot; etc., along with such others as &quot;Engelhardia spicata,&quot; tree rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron arboreum&quot;), &quot;Lyonia ovalifolia,&quot; wild Himalayan pear (&quot;Pyrus pashia&quot;), sumac (&quot;Rhus&quot; spp.), Himalayan maple (&quot;Acer oblongum&quot;), box myrtle (&quot;Myrica esculenta&quot;), &quot;Magnolia&quot; spp., and birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.). Some other common trees and large shrub species of subtropical forests are &quot;Semecarpus anacardium, Crateva unilocularis, Trewia nudiflora, Premna interrupta&quot;, Vietnam elm (&quot;Ulmus lancifolia&quot;), &quot;Ulmus chumlia, Glochidion velutinum&quot;, beautyberry (&quot;Callicarpa arborea&quot;), Indian mahogany (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;), fig tree (&quot;Ficus&quot; spp.), &quot;Mahosama similicifolia, Trevesia palmata,&quot; brushholly (&quot;Xylosma longifolium&quot;), false nettle (&quot;Boehmeria rugulosa&quot;), &quot;Heptapleurum venulosum, Casearia graveilens, Actinodaphne reticulata, Sapium insigne&quot;, Nepalese alder (&quot;Alnus nepalensis&quot;), marlberry (&quot;Ardisia thyrsiflora&quot;), holly (&quot;Ilex&quot; spp), &quot;Macaranga pustulata, Trichilia cannoroides,&quot; hackberry (&quot;Celtis tetrandra&quot;), &quot;Wenlendia puberula, Saurauia nepalensis,&quot; ring-cupped oak (&quot;Quercus glauca&quot;), &quot;Ziziphus incurva, Camellia kissi, Hymenodictyon flaccidum, Maytenus thomsonii&quot;, winged prickly ash (&quot;Zanthoxylum armatum&quot;), &quot;Eurya acuminata&quot;, matipo (&quot;Myrsine semiserrata&quot;), &quot;Sloanea tomentosa, Hydrangea aspera, Symplocos&quot; spp., and &quot;Cleyera&quot; spp.

In the temperate zone, the cloud forest between 2,000 and 3,000 m altitude supports broadleaved evergreen forest dominated by plants such as &quot;Quercus lamellosa&quot; and &quot;Q. semecarpifolia&quot; in pure or mixed stands. &quot;Lindera&quot; and &quot;Litsea&quot; species, Himalayan hemlock (&quot;Tsuga dumosa&quot;), and &quot;Rhododendron&quot; spp. are also present in the upper levels of this zone. Other important species are &quot;Magnolia campbellii, Michelia doltsopa,&quot; andromeda (&quot;Pieris ovalifolia&quot;), &quot;Daphniphyllum himalense, Acer campbellii, Acer pectinatum&quot;, and &quot;Sorbus cuspidata&quot;, but these species do not extend toward the west beyond central Nepal. Nepalese alder (&quot;Alnus nepalensis&quot;), a pioneer tree species, grows gregariously and forms pure patches of forests on newly exposed slopes, in gullies, beside rivers, and in other moist places.

The common forest types of this zone include &quot;Rhododendron arboreum, Rhododendron barbatum, Lyonia&quot; spp., &quot;Pieris formosa; Tsuga dumosa&quot; forest with such deciduous taxa as maple (&quot;Acer&quot;) and &quot;Magnolia&quot;; deciduous mixed broadleaved forest of &quot;Acer campbellii, Acer pectinatum, Sorbus cuspidata&quot;, and &quot;Magnolia campbellii&quot;; mixed broadleaved forest of &quot;Rhododendron arboreum, Acer campbellii, Symplocos ramosissima&quot; and Lauraceae.

This zone is habitat for many other important tree and large shrub species such as pindrow fir (&quot;Abies pindrow&quot;), East Himalayan fir (&quot;Abies spectabilis&quot;), &quot;Acer campbellii, Acer pectinatum,&quot; Himalayan birch (&quot;Betula utilis&quot;), &quot;Betula alnoides,&quot; boxwood (&quot;Buxus rugulosa&quot;), Himalayan flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus capitata&quot;), hazel (&quot;Corylus ferox&quot;), &quot;Deutzia staminea,&quot; spindle (&quot;Euonymus tingens&quot;), Siberian ginseng (&quot;Acanthopanax cissifolius&quot;), &quot;Coriaria terminalis&quot; ash (&quot;Fraxinus macrantha&quot;), &quot;Dodecadenia grandiflora, Eurya cerasifolia, Hydrangea heteromala, Ilex dipyrena&quot;, privet (&quot;Ligustrum&quot; spp.), &quot;Litsea elongata&quot;, common walnut (&quot;Juglans regia&quot;), &quot;Lichelia doltsopa, Myrsine capitallata, Neolitsea umbrosa,&quot; mock-orange (&quot;Philadelphus tomentosus&quot;), sweet olive (&quot;Osmanthus fragrans&quot;), Himalayan bird cherry (&quot;Prunus cornuta&quot;), and &quot;Viburnum continifolium&quot;.

In ancient times, laurel forests (&quot;shoyojurin&quot;) were the predominant vegetation type in the Taiheiyo evergreen forests ecoregion of Japan, which encompasses the mild temperate climate region of southeastern Japan&#x27;s Pacific coast. There were three main types of evergreen broadleaf forests, in which &quot;Castanopsis&quot;, &quot;Machilus&quot;, or &quot;Quercus&quot; predominated. Most of these forests were logged or cleared for cultivation and replanted with faster-growing conifers, like pine or hinoki, and only a few pockets remain.

=== Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines ===
Laurel forests occupy the humid tropical highlands of the Malay Peninsula, Greater Sunda Islands, and Philippines above elevation. The flora of these forests is similar to that of the warm-temperate and subtropical laurel forests of East Asia, including oaks &quot;(Quercus)&quot;, tanoak &quot;(Lithocarpus)&quot;, chinquapin &quot;(Castanopsis)&quot;, Lauraceae, Theaceae, and Clethraceae.

Epiphytes, including orchids, ferns, moss, lichen, and liverworts, are more abundant than in either temperate laurel forests or the adjacent lowland tropical rain forests. Myrtaceae are common at lower elevations, and conifers and rhododendrons at higher elevations. These forests are distinct in species composition from the lowland tropical forests, which are dominated by Dipterocarps and other tropical species.

=== Macaronesia and the Mediterranean Basin ===

Laurel forests are found in the islands of Macaronesia in the eastern Atlantic, in particular the Azores, Madeira Islands, and Canary Islands from 400 to 1200 metres elevation. Trees of the genera &quot;Apollonias&quot; (Lauraceae), &quot;Ocotea&quot; (Lauraceae), &quot;Persea&quot; (Lauraceae), &quot;Clethra&quot; (Clethraceae), &quot;Dracaena&quot; (Asparagaceae), &quot;Picconia&quot; (Oleaceae) and &quot;Heberdenia&quot; (Primulaceae) are characteristic. The Garajonay National Park, on the island of La Gomera and the Laurisilva in the Madeira Island were designated World Heritage sites by UNESCO in 1986 and 1999, respectively. They are considered the best remaining examples of the Atlantic laurel forest, due to their intact nature. The paleobotanical record of the island of Madeira reveals that laurisilva forests have existed on this island for at least 1.8 million years.

Around 50 million years ago, during the Paleocene, Europe took the form of a set of large islands spread through what was the Tethys Sea. The climate was wet and tropical with monsoon summer rains. Trees of the laurel and Fagaceae family (oaks with lauroid-shape leaves and Castanopsis) were common along several species of ferns. Around the Eocene, the planet began cooling, ultimately leading to the Pleistocene glaciations. This progressively deteriorated the Paleotropical flora of Europe, which went extinct in the late Pliocene. Some of these species went globally extinct (e.g. laurophyll &quot;Quercus&quot;), others survived in the Atlantic islands (e.g. &quot;Ocotea&quot;), or in other continents (e.g. &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Liquidambar&quot;) and some adapted to the cooler and drier climate of Europe and persisted as relicts in places with high mean annual precipitation or in particular river basins, such as sweet bay &quot;(Laurus nobilis)&quot; and European holly &quot;(Ilex aquifolium)&quot;, which are fairly widespread around the Mediterranean basin.

Descendants of these species can be found today in Europe, throughout the Mediterranean, especially in the Iberian Peninsula and the southern Black Sea Basin. The most important is ivy, a climber or vine that is well represented in most of Europe, where it spread again after the glaciations. The portuguese laurel cherry (&quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot;) is the only tree that survives as a relict in some Iberian riversides, especially in the western part of the peninsula. In other cases, the presence of Mediterranean laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;) provides an indication of the previous existence of laurel forest. This species survives natively in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands. The myrtle spread through North Africa. Tree heath &quot;(Erica arborea)&quot; grows in southern Europe, but without reaching the dimensions observed in the temperate evergreen forest of Macaronesia or North Africa. The broad-leaved &quot;Rhododendron ponticum baeticum&quot; and/or &quot;Rhamnus frangula baetica&quot; still persist in humid microclimates, such as stream valleys, in the provinces of Cádiz and Málaga in Spain, in the Portuguese Serra de Monchique, and the Rif Mountains of Morocco. The Parque Natural de Los Alcornocales has the biggest and best preserved relicts of Laurisilva in Western Europe.

Although the Atlantic laurisilva is more abundant in the Macaronesian archipelagos, where the weather has fluctuated little since the Tertiary, there are small representations and some species contribution to the oceanic and Mediterranean ecoregions of Europe, Asia minor and west and north of Africa, where microclimates in the coastal mountain ranges form inland &quot;islands&quot; favorable to the persistence of laurel forests. In some cases these were genuine islands in the Tertiary, and in some cases simply areas that remained ice-free. When the Strait of Gibraltar reclosed, the species repopulated toward the Iberian Peninsula to the north and were distributed along with other African species, but the seasonally drier and colder climate, prevented them reaching their previous extent. In Atlantic Europe, subtropical vegetation is interspersed with taxa from Europe and North Africa in bioclimatic enclaves such as the Serra de Monchique, Sintra, and the coastal mountains from Cadiz to Algeciras. In the Mediterranean region, remnant laurel forest is present on some islands of the Aegean Sea, on the Black Sea coast of Georgia and Turkey, and the Caspian Sea coast of Azerbaijan and Iran, including the &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and true &quot;laurus&quot; forests, associated with &quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot;, and conifers such as &quot;Taxus baccata&quot;, &quot;Cedrus atlantica&quot;, and &quot;Abies pinsapo&quot;.

In Europe the laurel forest has been badly damaged by timber harvesting, by fire (both accidental and deliberate to open fields for crops), by the introduction of exotic animal and plant species that have displaced the original cover, and by replacement with arable fields, exotic timber plantations, cattle pastures, and golf courses and tourist facilities. Most of the biota is in serious danger of extinction. The laurel forest flora is usually strong and vigorous and the forest regenerates easily; its decline is due to external forces.

=== Nepal ===
In the Himalayas, in Nepal, subtropical forest consists of species such as &quot;Schima wallichii&quot;, &quot;Castanopsis indica&quot;, and &quot;Castanopsis tribuloides&quot; in relatively humid areas. Some common forest types in this region include &quot;Castanopsis tribuloides&quot; mixed with &quot;Schima wallichi, Rhododendron&quot; spp., &quot;Lyonia ovalifolia, Eurya acuminata&quot;, and &quot;Quercus glauca&quot;; &quot;Castanopsis&quot;-Laurales forest with &quot;Symplocas&quot; spp.; &quot;Alnus nepalensis&quot; forests; &quot;Schima wallichii-Castanopsis indica&quot; hygrophile forest; &quot;Schima-Pinus&quot; forest; &quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; forests with &quot;Phyllanthus emblica. Semicarpus anacardium&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron arboreum&quot; and &quot;Lyoma ovalifolia; Schima-Lagerstroemia parviflora&quot; forest, &quot;Quercus lamellosa&quot; forest with &quot;Quercus lanata&quot; and &quot;Quercus glauca&quot;; &quot;Castanopsis&quot; forests with &quot;Castanopsis hystrix&quot; and Lauraceae.

=== Southern India ===

Laurel forests are also prevalent in the montane rain forests of the Western Ghats in southern India.

=== Sri Lanka ===

Laurel forest occurs in the montane rain forest of Sri Lanka.

=== Africa ===

The Afromontane laurel forests describe the plant and animal species common to the mountains of Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula. The afromontane regions of Africa are discontinuous, separated from each other by lowlands, resembling a series of islands in distribution. Patches of forest with Afromontane floristic affinities occur all along the mountain chains. Afromontane communities occur above elevation near the equator, and as low as elevation in the Knysna-Amatole montane forests of South Africa. Afromontane forests are cool and humid. Rainfall is generally greater than , and can exceed in some regions, occurring throughout the year or during winter or summer, depending on the region. Temperatures can be extreme at some of the higher altitudes, where snowfalls may occasionally occur.

In Subsaharan Africa, laurel forests are found in the Cameroon Highlands forests along the border of Nigeria and Cameroon, along the East African Highlands, a long chain of mountains extending from the Ethiopian Highlands around the African Great Lakes to South Africa, in the Highlands of Madagascar, and in the montane zone of the São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón forests. These scattered highland laurophyll forests of Africa are similar to one another in species composition (known as the Afromontane flora), and distinct from the flora of the surrounding lowlands.

The main species of the Afromontane forests include the broadleaf canopy trees of genus &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot;, with &quot;Apodytes dimidiata&quot;, &quot;Ilex mitis&quot;, &quot;Nuxia congesta&quot;, &quot;N. floribunda&quot;, &quot;Kiggelaria africana&quot;, &quot;Prunus africana&quot;, &quot;Rapanea melanophloeos&quot;, &quot;Halleria lucida&quot;, &quot;Ocotea bullata&quot;, and &quot;Xymalos monospora&quot;, along with the emergent conifers &quot;Podocarpus latifolius&quot; and &quot;Afrocarpus falcatus&quot;. Species composition of the Subsaharan laurel forests differs from that of Eurasia. Trees of the Laurel family are less prominent, limited to &quot;Ocotea&quot; or &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot; due to exceptional biological and paleoecological interest and the enormous biodiversity mostly but with many endemic species, and the members of the beech family (Fagaceae) are absent. 

Trees can be up to tall and distinct strata of emergent trees, canopy trees, and shrub and herb layers are present. Tree species include: Real Yellowwood (&quot;Podocarpus latifolius&quot;), Outeniqua Yellowwood (&quot;Podocarpus falcatus&quot;), White Witchhazel (&quot;Trichocladus ellipticus&quot;), &quot;Rhus chirendensis&quot;, &quot;Curtisia dentata&quot;, &quot;Calodendrum capense&quot;, &quot;Apodytes dimidiata&quot;, &quot;Halleria lucida&quot;, &quot;Ilex mitis&quot;, &quot;Kiggelaria africana&quot;, &quot;Nuxia floribunda&quot;, &quot;Xymalos monospora&quot;, and &quot;Ocotea bullata&quot;. Shrubs and climbers are common and include: Common Spikethorn (&quot;Maytenus heterophylla&quot;), Cat-thorn (&quot;Scutia myrtina&quot;), Numnum (&quot;Carissa bispinosa&quot;), &quot;Secamone alpinii&quot;, &quot;Canthium ciliatum&quot;, &quot;Rhoicissus tridentata&quot;, &quot;Zanthoxylum capense&quot;, and &quot;Burchellia bubalina&quot;. In the undergrowth grasses, herbs and ferns may be locally common: Basketgrass (&quot;Oplismenus hirtellus&quot;), Bushman Grass (&quot;Stipa dregeana&quot; var. &quot;elongata&quot;), Pigs-ears (&quot;Centella asiatica&quot;), &quot;Cyperus albostriatus&quot;, &quot;Polypodium polypodioides&quot;, &quot;Polystichum tuctuosum&quot;, &quot;Streptocarpus rexii&quot;, and &quot;Plectranthus&quot; spp. Ferns, shrubs and small trees such as Cape Beech (&quot;Rapanea melanophloeos&quot;) are often abundant along the forest edges.

===Southeast United States===

According to the recent study by Box and Fujiwara (Evergreen Broadleaved Forests of the Southeastern United States: Preliminary Description), laurel forests occur in patches in the southeastern United States from southeast Virginia southward to Florida, and west to Texas, mostly along the coast and coastal plain of the Gulf and south Atlantic coast. In the southeastern United States, evergreen Hammock (ecology) (i.e. topographically induced forest islands) contain many laurel forests. These laurel forests occur mostly in moist depression and floodplains, and are found in moist environments. In many portions of the coastal plain, a low-lying mosaic topography of white sand, silt, and limestone (mostly in Florida), separate these laurel forests. Frequent fire is also thought to be responsible for the disjointed geography of laurel forests across the coastal plain of the southeastern United States.

Despite being located in a humid climate zone, much of the broadleaf Laurel forests in the Southeast USA are semi-sclerophyll in character. The semi-sclerophyll character is due (in part) to the sandy soils and often periodic semi-arid nature of the climate. As one moves south into central Florida, as well as far southern Texas and the Gulf Coastal margin of the southern United States, the sclerophyll character slowly declines and more tree species from the tropics (specifically, the Caribbean and Mesoamerica) increase as the temperate species decline. As such, the southeastern laurel forests gives way to a mixed landscape of tropical savanna and tropical rainforest.

There are several different broadleaved evergreen canopy trees in the laurel forests of the southeastern United States. In some areas, the evergreen forests are dominated by species of Live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;), Laurel oak (&quot;Quercus hemisphaerica&quot;), southern magnolia (&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;), red bay (&quot;Persea borbonia&quot;), cabbage palm (&quot;Sabal palmetto&quot;), and sweetbay magnolia (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;). In several areas on the barrier islands, a stunted &quot;Quercus geminata&quot; or mixed &quot;Q. geminata&quot; and &quot;Quercus virginiana&quot; forest dominates, with a dense evergreen understory of scrub palm &quot;Serenoa repens&quot; and a variety of vines, including &quot;Bignonia capreolata&quot;, as well as &quot;Smilax&quot; and &quot;Vitis species&quot;&#x27;. &quot;Gordonia lasianthus&quot;, &quot;Ilex opaca&quot; and &quot;Osmanthus americanus&quot; also may occur as canopy co-dominant in coastal dune forests, with &quot;Cliftonia monophylla&quot; and &quot;Vaccinium arboreum&quot; as a dense evergreen understory (Box and Fujiwara 1988).

The lower shrub layer of the evergreen forests is often mixed with other evergreen species from the palm family (&quot;Rhapidophyllum hystrix&quot;), bush palmetto (&quot;Sabal minor&quot;), and saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;), and several species in the Ilex family, including &quot;Ilex glabra&quot;, Dahoon holly, and Yaupon holly. In many areas, &quot;Cyrilla racemiflora&quot;, &quot;Lyonia fruticosa&quot;, wax myrtle &quot;Myrica&quot; is present as an evergreen understory. Several species of &quot;Yucca&quot; and &quot;Opuntia&quot; are native as well to the drier sandy coastal scrub environment of the region, including &quot;Yucca aloifolia&quot;, &quot;Yucca filamentosa&quot;, &quot;Yucca gloriosa&quot;, and &quot;Opuntia stricta&quot;.

===Ancient California===
During the Miocene, oak-laurel forests were found in Central and Southern California. Typical tree species included oaks ancestral to present-day California oaks, as well as an assemblage of trees from the Laurel family, including &quot;Nectandra&quot;, &quot;Ocotea&quot;, &quot;Persea&quot;, and &quot;Umbellularia&quot;. Only one native species from the Laurel family (Lauraceae), &quot;Umbellularia californica,&quot; remains in California today.

There are however, several areas in Mediterranean California, as well as isolated areas of southern Oregon that have evergreen forests. Several species of evergreen &quot;Quercus&quot; forests occur, as well as a mix of evergreen scrub typical of Mediterranean climates. Species of &quot;Notholithocarpus&quot;, &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;, and &quot;Umbellularia californica&quot; can be canopy species in several areas.

=== Central America ===
The laurel forest is the most common Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest type. They are found in mountainous areas of southern Mexico and almost all Central American countries, normally more than above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the Laurel family, and species of &quot;Weinmannia&quot;, &quot;Drimys&quot;, and &quot;Magnolia&quot;. The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua the cloud forests are found in the border zone with Honduras, and most were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica there are laurisilvas in the &quot;Cordillera de Tilarán&quot; and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.

=== Tropical Andes ===

The Yungas are typically evergreen forests or jungles, and multi-species, which often contain many species of the laurel forest. They occur discontinuously from Venezuela to northwestern Argentina including in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, usually in the Sub-Andean Sierras. The forest relief is varied and in places where the Andes meet the Amazon, it includes steeply sloped areas. Characteristic of this region are deep ravines formed by the rivers, such as that of the Tarma River descending to the San Ramon Valley, or the Urubamba River as it passes through Machu Picchu. Many of the Yungas are degraded or are forests in recovery that have not yet reached their climax vegetation.

=== Southeastern South America ===

The laurel forests of the region are known as the &quot;Laurisilva Misionera&quot;, after Argentina&#x27;s Misiones Province. The Araucaria moist forests occupy a portion of the highlands of southern Brazil, extending into northeastern Argentina. The forest canopy includes species of Lauraceae (&quot;Ocotea pretiosa&quot;, &quot;O. catharinense&quot; and &quot;O. porosa&quot;), Myrtaceae (&quot;Campomanesia xanthocarpa&quot;), and Leguminosae (&quot;Parapiptadenia rigida&quot;), with an emergent layer of the conifer Brazilian Araucaria (&quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;) reaching up to in height. The subtropical Serra do Mar coastal forests along the southern coast of Brazil have a tree canopy of Lauraceae and Myrtaceae, with emergent trees of Leguminaceae, and a rich diversity of bromeliads and trees and shrubs of family Melastomaceae. The inland Alto Paraná Atlantic forests, which occupy portions of the Brazilian Highlands in southern Brazil and adjacent parts of Argentina and Paraguay, are semi-deciduous.

=== Central Chile ===
The Valdivian temperate rain forests, or &quot;Laurisilva Valdiviana&quot;, occupy southern Chile and Argentina from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes between 38° and 45° latitude. Rainfall is abundant, from according to locality, distributed throughout the year, but with some subhumid Mediterranean climate influence for 3–4 months in summer. The temperatures are sufficiently invariant and mild, with no month falling below , and the warmest month below .

=== Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand ===
Laurel forest appears on mountains of the coastal strip of New South Wales in Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The laurel forests of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand are home to species related to those in the Valdivian laurel forests,

&quot;Beilschmiedia tawa&quot; is often the dominant canopy species of the laural genus &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot; in lowland laurel forests in the North Island and the northeast of the South Island, but will also often form the subcanopy in primary forests throughout the country in these areas, with podocarps. Genus &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot; are trees and shrubs widespread in tropical Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America as far south as Chile. In the Corynocarpus family, &quot;Corynocarpus laevigatus&quot; is sometimes called laurel of New Zealand, while &quot;Laurelia novae-zelandiae&quot; belongs to the same genus as &quot;Laurelia sempervirens&quot;. The tree niaouli grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and Papua.

The New Guinea and Northern Australian ecoregions are also closely related.

==== New Guinea ====
The eastern end of Malesia, including New Guinea and the Aru Islands of eastern Indonesia, is linked to Australia by a shallow continental shelf, and shares many marsupial mammal and bird taxa with Australia. New Guinea also has many additional elements of the Antarctic flora, including southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) and Eucalypts. New Guinea has the highest mountains in Malesia, and vegetation ranges from tropical lowland forest to tundra.

The highlands of New Guinea and New Britain are home to montane laurel forests, from about elevation. These forests include species typical of both Northern Hemisphere laurel forests, including &quot;Lithocarpus, Ilex,&quot; and Lauraceae, and Southern Hemisphere laurel forests, including Southern Beech &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, &quot;Araucaria&quot;, Podocarps, and trees of the Myrtle family (Myrtaceae). New Guinea and Northern Australia are closely related. Around 40 million years ago, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it collided with the Pacific Plate on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea emerged around 5 million years ago. In the lee of this collision zone, the ancient rock formations of what is now Cape York Peninsula remained largely undisturbed.

===== Laurel forest ecoregions of New Guinea =====
The WWF identifies several distinct montane laurel forest ecoregions on New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland.
* Central Range montane rain forests
* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests
* New Britain–New Ireland montane rain forests
* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests
* Vogelkop montane rain forests

<text>The Ferrari 550 Maranello (&quot;tipo&quot; F133) is a front-engine V12 2-seat grand tourer built by Ferrari from 1996 to 2002. The 550 Maranello marked Ferrari&#x27;s return to a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout for its 2-seater 12-cylinder model, 23 years after the 365 GTB/4 Daytona had been replaced by the mid-engined Berlinetta Boxer.

In 2000, Ferrari introduced the 550 Barchetta Pininfarina, a limited production roadster version of the 550 which was limited to just 448 examples. The 550 was replaced by the upgraded 575M Maranello in 2002.

==History==

Since 1973, when the traditional front-engined 365 GTB/4 Daytona had been replaced by the mid-engined Berlinetta Boxer, Ferrari&#x27;s top-of-the-line 12-cylinder 2-seater model had used a mid-mounted 180° 12-cylinder flat engine. The Berlinetta Boxer had later been developed into the Testarossa, the final evolution of which was the 1994 F512 M. Under the presidency of Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, who took office in 1991, the F512 M replacement was developed as a traditional front-engined V12 grand tourer.

After 30 months of development, the Ferrari 550 Maranello was unveiled in July 1996 at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany. The model&#x27;s name referred to the 5.5-litres total engine displacement in centilitres and to the town of Maranello, home to the Ferrari headquarters and factory. Pininfarina executed both the exterior and interior design. The exterior design is credited to Elvio D&#x27;Aprile under the supervision of Lorenzo Ramaciotti, and created between 1993 and 1996. Maurizio Corbi, a Pininfarina sketch artist and designer, was also involved in the design process. The interior design was penned by Goran Popović. Frame and main engine components were shared with the 2+2 Ferrari 456, although at , the 550&#x27;s wheelbase was shorter.

In 2002 the 550 was replaced by the 575M Maranello, which was an all-around improved version (&quot;modificata&quot; in Ferrari parlance) of the car, rather than an all-new construction. The 575M was fitted with a larger 5.75-litre version of the F133 engine. In total 3,083 units of the 550 Maranello were produced between 1996 and 2001.

==Specifications==

===Body and chassis===

The 550 used a front-engine, rear-wheel drive transaxle layout, with the 6-speed gearbox located at the rear axle together with the limited-slip differential. The chassis is a tubular steel space frame, to which the aluminium body panels were soldered. The Pininfarina-designed body had a drag coefficient of 0.33. Suspension was of the double wishbone type with coaxial coil spring and damper units on all four corners, and anti-roll bars front and rear. The steering was rack and pinion with variable power assist. The vented disc brakes were at the front and at the rear. Magnesium alloy was used for the 18-inch wheels. Electronic driver aid systems included anti-slip regulation, which could be adjusted on two levels or switched off completely, and four-way anti-lock braking system.

===Engine===

The &quot;F133 A&quot; engine is a naturally aspirated 65° V12 with four valves per cylinder, dual overhead cams and a variable length intake manifold. It displaces and produces at 7,000 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. Bore and stroke measure 88 mm and 75 mm. The Barchetta&#x27;s engine is very similar and has the same output but carries the &quot;F133 C&quot; engine code.

===Performance===
According to Ferrari, the 550 Maranello has a top speed of , and can accelerate from a standstill to in 4.4 seconds. Testing the 550 Maranello in 2000, American car magazine &quot;Motor Trend&quot; recorded a acceleration time of 4.2 seconds, a time of 9.6 seconds, and a ¼ mile (0.4 km) time of 12.5 seconds at 116.9 mph.

=== 550 Maranello World Speed Record (WSR) ===
In October 1998, Ferrari sent a lightly modified 550 to a 12 kilometers oval test track to the Transportation Research Center in East Liberty, Ohio and set three new world records as follows:

* A distance of 100 miles covered at an average speed of .
* A distance of 100 kilometers at an average speed of .
* Driving for one hour at an average speed of .

To celebrate these records, Ferrari built 33 road cars to the exact specification of the record-setting car. Aside from the actual record setting car, all the WSR cars were finished to European specifications. These differ from the standard 550M by having been fitted with the Fiorano handling pack, a leather-trimmed roll cage, suede-covered steering wheel, and carbon bucket seats with race harnesses and &quot;Daytona&quot; stitching. A WSR plaque was installed on the center console and carbon fiber detailing was applied to the gear knob and footrests. Besides the plaque, all the other extras could be ordered on a regular 550 as well, including the handling package and the integrated roll cage.

A preproduction Lamborghini Murciélago broke these records in 2002 at the Nardò Ring in Italy.

== 550 Barchetta Pininfarina==
Ferrari introduced a roadster version of the 550 at the Paris Motor Show in 2000 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Pininfarina. The Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina was a true barchetta with no real convertible top provided. The factory did provide a cloth soft top, but it was intended only for temporary use to protect the interior from rain as using the top above was not deemed safe. Aesthetically, the barchetta featured a more deeply raked windshield than the coupé for improved aero dynamics, roll-over hoops behind the seats, and a longer rear section than the coupé to complete the smooth overall design resulting in more cargo space than the coupé, even when it was less practical. Other changes included new 19-inch alloy wheels specially made for the barchetta. A total of 448 cars were produced, four more than initially planned 444 cars due to concerns of superstition in the Japanese market about the number 4. The 448 cars were preceded by 12 prototypes numbered P01–P12 on their interior plaques. To an observer the prototypes and production cars are indistinguishable. The mechanical underpinnings of the car remained the same as its coupé counterpart but the engine was given the &quot;F133C&quot; code mainly for differentiation. Performance figures differed as compared to the 550 Maranello due to the loss of a roof, with acceleration time same as the coupe at 4.4 seconds but top speed reduced to . All the 448 cars had a numbered plaque (i.e. x of 448) on the dashboard with Sergio Pininfarina&#x27;s signature.
== Concept cars and one-off specials ==

===Rossa===

The 550-based Ferrari Rossa was a concept car introduced at the 2000 Turin Motor Show to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Pininfarina. The 2-door speedster shares the mechanical components from the 550 Maranello but its top speed is reduced to due to increased weight. The design of the Rossa was inspired by the 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, and the futuristic styling elements later found their way to future Ferrari production cars such as the Enzo and the F430. It was designed by Ken Okuyama at Pininfarina.

===550 GTZ Barchetta===
On October 28, 2009, Zagato and Ferrari revealed that they have been working on a roadster version of the 575 GTZ coupé to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the long collaboration between the two Italian establishments. The resulting product called the 550 GTZ Barchetta was limited to only three units and based on the 550 Barchetta Pininfarina, including one RHD example. Unlike the original version, Zagato developed an electronically-operated roof. The design of the GTZ Barchetta was inspired by the 1956 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta.

All examples were sold at a price of £1 million (€1.1 million/ US$1.6 million) each. In December 2019, the RHD car sold at a Bonhams auction for £ 575,000 including premium with 2,700 miles. 

===Touring Superleggera Veloce12===
Coachbuilt by Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, the Superleggera Veloce12 is a limited-edition grand tourer, based on Ferrari 550 with only 30 models planned and was unveiled at Monterey Car Week in 2024. 

==Motorsport==

Although not intended for motorsport, some privateer teams took it upon themselves to develop the 550 for use in various series. The first racing 550, known as 550 GT, was built for French team Red Racing to comply with international sporting regulations. The project was developed by Michel Enjolras and assembled in the Italtecnica workshop. The car was first tested in April 1999 and was used in the GT3 class of the French FFSA GT Championship. In 2001 the car was then sold to XL Racing who continued the development and built a second car, known as 550 XL entering the FFSA GT and the American Le Mans Series. The older 550 GT also made an appearance at the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans in the ACO GT class but failed to finish due to technical problems.

In 2000, with financial support from some investors led by Stéphane Ratel, Italtecnica created another 550 race car meeting the more powerful GT regulations in the FIA GT Championship, the car being named 550 Millennio. The first car debuted in the 2000 FIA GT Championship, entered by First Racing. The 2001 Championship saw two cars fielded by Team Rafanelli. The 550 Millennio was also developed to meet ACO LM-GTS regulations allowing Rafanelli to enter a single car in the 2002 American Le Mans Series season.

In November 2000, German entrepreneur and engineer Franz Wieth launched another racing version of the 550, developed by Baumgartner Sportwagen Technik, and named 550 GTS. Two cars were built, with Wieth Racing entering one in the 2001 FIA GT Championship, then again in 2003, 2004 and 2005. In 2006 the Wieth&#x27;s Ferrari scored two wins in the Euro GT Series.

Commissioned by Frédéric Dor&#x27;s company Care Racing Development, in 2001 Prodrive built a racing version of the 550 for various sports car series and especially the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Initially known as 550 GTO and then renamed 550 GTS (but not related to Wieth&#x27;s project), a total of ten cars would be built over the next four years and campaigned by the Prodrive team as well as privateer customers. The cars were entirely built by Prodrive without any support from the Ferrari factory.

The factory Prodrive team would win two races in the 2001 FIA GT Championship debut. For 2002 the BMS Scuderia Italia team would take over in FIA GT, recording four wins, while the Prodrive squad would take a single win in the American Le Mans Series. 2003 would be the best year for the cars, as Prodrive won the GTS class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and took second in the GTS class championship in the American Le Mans Series with four wins, while BMS Scuderia Italia gained the FIA GT championship winning eight races.

The Italian team would again take the FIA GT Championship crown in 2004, while Larbre Compétition won the GT1 class championship in the new Le Mans Series. BMS Scuderia Italia moved then to the Le Mans Series as well taking that championship for 2005. In the meantime Prodrive switched to their next project, the Aston Martin DBR9, leaving the maintenance of the 550 GTS cars to Care Racing Development. Hitotsuyama Racing entered a car in the 2004 JGTC and 2005 Super GT seasons, then switched to the Japan Le Mans Challenge winning the GT1-class title in both 2006 and 2007 editions. In 2008 Argentinian Automóvil Club Argentina Team entered 2 Prodrive 550&#x27;s, one of them scoring and achieving the fifth place in the Potrero de los Funes round. The last race of the 550 GTS was the 2009 FIA GT Paul Ricard 2 Hours where a car entered by French team Solution F achieved the seventh place.

In late 2003, Australian Nations Cup Championship team Mark Coffey Racing purchased a 550 GT from Team Rafanelli to run in the 2004 Australian Nations Cup Championship. The appearance of the V12 Ferrari in Australia was eagerly awaited by fans of the category and the car was to be driven by popular young Danish driver Allan Simonsen who prior to the championship had raced the car alongside David Brabham to win the Bahrain GT Festival. In what was a limited campaign (the car only raced at 4 of the 7 rounds), Simonsen finished 7th in the championship against cars such as the championship winning Lamborghini Diablo GTR, Chrysler Viper ACR, Porsche 911 GT2 and the controversial 7.0 litre Holden Monaros. Simonsen broke the class lap record and scored a race win in the first round of the season at the Adelaide Street Circuit.

Following the success of the Prodrive&#x27;s 550 GTS, Ferrari would develop the 575 GTC racecar based on the 575M, offering it as a customer car for privateers.

==Awards and recognition==

In 2004, &quot;Evo magazine&quot; ran a ‘Greatest Drivers’ Car’ showdown with the greatest cars from the previous ten years, including the Porsche 911 GT3, the Honda NSX-R and the Pagani Zonda C12S. The 550 Maranello won that challenge. The magazine stated that &quot;‘As with all great cars, there’s no one facet that dominates the experience’. ‘Yes the engine is mighty, but the chassis is its equal. There&#x27;s never been a supercar that&#x27;s so exploitable and so rounded in its abilities.’&quot;

The 5.5 L F133 V12 engine won the &quot;over 4 litre&quot; class of the International Engine of the Year award for 2000 and 2001.

<text>Barchetta () is an Italian word commonly translated into English as &quot;little boat&quot;. The term originally referred to a small skiff used for recreational purposes. It is also applied to some items of clothing, as well as being used in automobile styling, where it describes a class of open-top, two-seat sports cars.

==Etymology==

===Italian===
The root of barchetta is &quot;barca&quot;, the Italian word for &quot;boat&quot;. In Italian &quot;small boat&quot; would be &quot;piccola barca&quot;.

The use of the diminutive suffix &quot;-etta&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;-etto&quot;, confers the sense of something small or tiny with a connotation of endearment or affection towards the object.

The plural form of barchetta is &quot;barchette&quot;.

===French===
In French the equivalent term is &quot;barquette&quot;. The root word &quot;barque&quot;, which in French refers to a boat with three or more masts, is combined with the diminutive suffix &quot;-ette&quot;. In common use, barquette may refer to a shallow container or tray. Its use when describing an automobile is similar to that of the Italian term.

==Clothing==
A &quot;cappello a barchetta&quot; refers to a military side cap similar to a bustina. It may also refer to an out-moded three-cornered hat somewhat similar to a tricorne with a less pronounced brim. 
A &quot;tasca a barchetta&quot; or &quot;barchetta pocket&quot; refers to a breast pocket in a men&#x27;s suit jacket or blazer cut and trimmed in the curved shape of a boat.

==Automobiles==
===Description===

When applied to an automobile, &quot;barchetta&quot; describes a small car that is open-topped, without provision of a removable or foldable top for weather protection. Instead of a full windshield, the barchetta has a low-rise transparent wind deflector that may be a single full width piece, be divided into two sections, or omitted entirely. With an emphasis on performance, unnecessary trim and equipment is kept to a minimum.

The barchetta has full-width enveloping bodywork, in contrast to an early spider corsa, which may have cycle or wing fenders. Later (non-corsa) spiders added more heavily padded seats, interior carpeting and a full windshield, items not found in the more spartan barchette. Some later cars still called barchette were more well-appointed, following the trend of the later spiders and convertibles.

===Origins and use===

The first car to be called a barchetta was a Ferrari 166 MM shown at the 1948 Turin Auto Show. The car was designed by Federico Formenti at Carrozzeria Touring. Giovanni Canestrini, editor of the Italian sporting newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, applied the term to describe the new car&#x27;s original bodystyle. The name barchetta has been associated with the open 166 MM model ever since.

Ferrari built other models also called barchetta, including versions of the Ferrari 212 Inter and the Ferrari 250 MM Vignale.

Other manufacturers began to use the name as well, such as the Maserati brothers&#x27; O.S.C.A. MT4 barchetta of 1948, the 1953 Moretti 750 barchetta, and the 1966 Abarth 1000 SP racing barchetta.

The label was also applied retroactively to cars that had been built before the launch of the Ferrari 166MM, such as the 1943 Stanguellini Ala d&#x27;Oro.

More contemporary barchette have included the 1991 track-oriented Maserati Barchetta, the Fiat Barchetta of 1995–2005, Ferrari&#x27;s 2001 550 Barchetta Pininfarina built to mark Pininfarina&#x27;s 70th anniversary, the 2003 Lamborghini Murciélago Barchetta Concept, that entered production under Roadster nameplate; the 2001 Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato Barchetta recreation, the 2007 Bertone Barchetta Concept the 2018 Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta and the Morgan Midsummer.

<text>Alexander Mebane, Jr. (November 26, 1744 – July 5, 1795) was a U.S. Congressman from the state of North Carolina from 1793 to 1795. He was also a brigadier general in the North Carolina militia during the Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
Alexander Mebane, Jr. was one of twelve children born to Alexander Mebane, Sr. and Mary Tinnin. Born in Lancaster County in the Province of Pennsylvania, he moved to Hawfields, North Carolina, by the time his father received a land grant in 1754. Mebane attended common schools in Orange County. He served as a delegate to the Provincial Congress of North Carolina in 1776, was named justice of the peace in 1776, the first sheriff of Orange County under statehood in 1777, and auditor of the Hillsborough district in 1783 and 1784.

==Military service==
Alexander served in the following positions during the American Revolution: 
* Colonel in the Southern Orange County Regiment of militia (1776–1777)
* Colonel over the Orange County Regiment of militia (1777–1780)
* Commissary General for the State of North Carolina, with the rank of Brigadier General (1780–1783)
* Colonel of the horse for the Hillsborough District (1788)
* General of the Hillsborough District (1789)

==Political career==
Mebane was an anti-federalist member of the conventions in Hillsborough in 1788 and in Fayetteville in 1789 which considered ratification of the United States Constitution. Mebane served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1787 to 1792, unsuccessfully ran for the 2nd congressional district in 1791, and was elected to the 3rd United States Congress in 1792, where he served one term representing the 4th congressional district (March 4, 1793 – March 3, 1795). He was re-elected to the 4th United States Congress, but died before the term began. Mebane was one of the original trustees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Death==
Alexander Mebane, Jr. died at Hawfields in Orange County, on July 5, 1795, shortly after he finished his first term in Congress. He is buried at First Hawfields Burying Ground, Cheeks Township, Orange County, North Carolina.

Mebane, North Carolina is named for him.

<doc id="1183661" wikidata="Q236974" url="?curid=1183661" title="Radegund">
<text>Radegund (; also spelled &quot;Rhadegund, Radegonde, or Radigund&quot;; 520 – 13 August 587) was a Thuringian princess and Frankish queen, who founded the Abbey of the Holy Cross at Poitiers. She is the patroness saint of several churches in France and England and of Jesus College, Cambridge (whose full name is &quot;The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist &quot;and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund&quot;, near Cambridge&quot;).

== Life ==

Radegund was born about 520 to Bertachar, one of the three kings of the German land Thuringia. Radegund&#x27;s uncle, Hermanfrid, killed Bertachar in battle, and took Radegund into his household. After allying with the Frankish King Theuderic, Hermanfrid defeated his other brother Baderic. However, having crushed his brothers and seized control of Thuringia, Hermanfrid reneged on his agreement with Theuderic to share sovereignty.

In 531, Theuderic returned to Thuringia with his brother Clotaire I (also known as Chlothar). Together they defeated Hermanfrid and conquered his kingdom. Clotaire I also took charge of Radegund, taking her back to Merovingian Gaul with him. He sent the child to his villa of Athies in Picardy for several years, before marrying her in 540.

Radegund was one of Clotaire I&#x27;s six wives or concubines (the other five being Guntheuca who was the widow of his brother Chlodomer, Chunsina, Ingund, Ingund&#x27;s sister Aregund and Wuldetrada the widow of Clotaire&#x27;s grand-nephew Theudebald). She had no children with him. Radegund was noted for her almsgiving.

By 545 Radegund&#x27;s brother was the last surviving male member of the Thuringian royal family. Clotaire had him murdered. Radegund fled the court and sought the protection of the Church, persuading Medardus, the bishop of Noyon, to ordain her as a deaconess; she founded the monastery of Sainte-Croix in Poitiers , where she cared for the infirm. Radegund was widely believed to have the gift of healing.

Living under the &quot;Rule for Virgins&quot; of Caesarius of Arles—which Radegund had received from his niece, Caesaria—the nuns were required to be able to read and write, and to devote several hours of the day to reading the scriptures and copying manuscripts, as well as traditional tasks such as weaving and needlework. This Rule strictly enclosed women, to the point that nuns of Sainte-Croix were unable to attend Radegund&#x27;s funeral.

Her abbey was named for the relic of the True Cross that Radegund obtained from the Byzantine Emperor Justin II. Although the bishop Maroveus of Poitiers refused to install it in the abbey, at Radegund&#x27;s request king Sigebert I sent Eufronius of Tours to Poitiers to perform the ceremony. To celebrate the relic and its installation into Sainte-Croix, Venantius Fortunatus composed a series of hymns, including the famous Vexilla Regis, considered to be one of the most significant Christian hymns ever written, which is still sung for services on Good Friday, Palm Sunday, as well as the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.

Radegund was a close friend of Junian of Maire; Junian and Radegund are said to have died on the same day, 13 August 587.

==Asceticism==
Radegund was known for her ascetic behaviour and has been described as an &quot;extreme ascetic&quot;. She followed a vegan diet, refusing all animal products. She ate nothing but legumes and green vegetables: neither fruit nor fish nor eggs.

Radegund also abstained from wine, mead and beer. During Lent she abstained from bread, oil, and salt, and only drank a little water. She acted against the advice of others who warned her that her extreme ascetism might make her ill. She bound her neck and arms with three iron circlets; her flesh was badly cut because of this. On one occasion she heated a brass cross and pressed it on her body.

== Literary connections ==
The poet Venantius Fortunatus and the bishop, hagiographer, and historian, Gregory of Tours, were close friends with Radegund and wrote extensively about her. She wrote Latin poems to Fortunatus on tablets that have been lost. The three of them seem to have been close and Fortunatus&#x27; relations with Radegund seem to have been based on friendship. There are two poems written in the voice of Radegund, &quot;De Excidio Thoringiae&quot; and &quot;Ad Artachin&quot;. While it has been proposed that Venantius wrote them, recent historians see her as the author.

Another biography was written by the nun Baudovinia following a rebellion at the abbey described by Gregory of Tours.

Radegund&#x27;s funeral, which Venantius Fortunatus and Gregory of Tours attended, was three days after her death. She was buried in what was to become the Church of St. Radegonde in Poitiers. Her tomb can still be found in the crypt of that church, which remains the center of devotion to her. In the 1260s a church decoration program included stained-glass windows depicting Radegund&#x27;s life. These were later largely destroyed by Huguenots.

In her book &quot;Woman Under Monasticism: Chapters on Saint-Lore and Convent Life between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500&quot; (1896) Lina Eckenstein drew the attention of modern readers to the rebellion of the nuns at Poitiers after the death of Radegund, during which, for a period of two years, they refused to accept a new abbess who had been appointed by the male hierarchy.

==Attributes==
She is typically depicted &quot;with royal robes, crown, and sceptre&quot; and nearby there are &quot;wolves and wild beasts&quot; which are tame in her presence. Also: &quot;Crosier and book. Field of oats. White headdress, tunic with fleurs-de-lys, mantle with castles.&quot;

== Namesakes ==


Five English parish churches are dedicated to her, and she had a chapel in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, as well as in Gloucester, Lichfield, and Exeter Cathedrals. St. Radegund&#x27;s Abbey, near Dover, was founded in her honour in 1191, and Longleat Priory in Wiltshire was also dedicated to her. She is also a patron saint of Jesus College, Cambridge, which was founded on the site of the 12th century Priory of Saint Mary and Saint Radegund.

The St Radegund public house in Cambridge is named in her honour. St Rhadagund&#x27;s Holiday and Conference Centre on the Isle of Wight is also named after her.

There are many places named Sainte-Radegonde in France.

Austria has two locations named after Saint Radegund. Sankt Radegund in Upper Austria is a municipality in the district of Braunau am Inn, situated at the western rim of the Innviertel region, where the Salzach river forms the border to the German state of Bavaria. Saint Radegund is also the namesake of Sankt Radegund bei Graz, a municipality in the district of Graz-Umgebung in the Austrian state of Styria.

Close to the ruins of the castle Mühlburg which can be dated back to 704 above the village of Mühlberg in Thuringia in Germany, the foundations of a chapel dedicated to St Radegund can be visited.

<text>Kekionga (, meaning &quot;blackberry bush&quot;), also known as Kiskakon or Pacan&#x27;s Village, was the capital of the Miami tribe. It was located at the confluence of the Saint Joseph and Saint Marys rivers to form the Maumee River on the western edge of the Great Black Swamp in present-day Indiana. Over their respective decades of influence from colonial times to after the American Revolution, French and Indian Wars, and the Northwest Indian Wars, the French, British and Americans all established trading posts and forts at the large village, originally known as Fort Miami, due to its key location on the portage connecting Lake Erie to the Wabash and Mississippi rivers. The European-American town of Fort Wayne, Indiana started as a settlement around the American Fort Wayne stockade after the War of 1812.

== History ==
Long occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples, Kekionga was a large village of the Miami people at the time of European encounter; The largest village of its kind in the state of Indiana. Its name refers to the abundance of blackberries in the region, and was located in the most expansive brier patch in the state. Kekionga was naturally situated to be an important trading post for Europeans due to its location on the six-mile portage between the Maumee and Little rivers, which connected Lake Erie to the Wabash River and Mississippi River. Due to the mid-17th century French and Iroquois Wars over the fur trade, most traders believed the route was too dangerous. Following the wars, however, the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of New France (Canada) and La Louisiane. The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years.

The Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans, who were primarily Canadiens from Quebec. Under Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, the Canadiens established a trading post and fort, first at the St. Joseph River, and later at Kekionga. Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship.

Kekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades; their other villages were more temporary. The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils. However, a smallpox epidemic struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year. In a speech at the Treaty of Greenville (1795), Little Turtle called Kekionga &quot;that glorious gate ... through which all the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south, and from the east to the west.&quot;

Additionally, the village served as a gathering center for warrior natives of various tribes who engaged on the frontier. Approximately 26 war parties were known to have left the village throughout 1786. There is strong tradition and evidence to support that a secret society of prominent Miami warriors periodically met at the Miamitown to burn a captive and eat their flesh. There is additional information that for an extended period of time, the Shawnee would also torture captives here taken from southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. The site of this torture ground was allegedly located near the present day Columbia street bridge in Lakeside. This activity contributed to the outbreak of the Northwest Indian War. 
=== Colonial period ===
British merchants, seeking to expand their economic base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, in violation of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. In 1749, the pro-British La Demoiselle left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of Pickawillany, which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of Detroit and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French voyageurs to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752. In the same year, the pro-French chief Cold Foot died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied Three Fires Confederacy destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.

After the French and Indian War (1756-1763) ended with the French defeated, France ceded Canada to the British Empire. The Miami of Kekionga became involved in Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion in the spring of 1763, capturing the British garrison and killing the two ranking officers. The following year, Pacanne emerged as the village chief when he spared the life of the captive Captain Thomas Morris and returned him to Detroit. By 1765, Kekionga had accepted the British. Deputy commissioner George Croghan described Kekionga:

The Twightwee Village is situated on both Sides of a River called St. Joseph&#x27;s ... The Indian Village Consists of about 40 or 50 Cabins besides nine or ten French Houses.

=== As part of the Northwest Territory ===

In 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, Kekionga was sacked by a force of French colonials led by Colonel Augustin de La Balme, who planned to take Detroit from the British. A Miami force led by Chief Little Turtle destroyed the French force. The Miami and the European-American traders of Kekionga remained economically tied to the British-held Fort Detroit, even after the British ceded all claims of the Northwest Territory to the new United States following the war in the Treaty of Paris (1783).

In 1790, the Canadian Governor Guy Carleton warned the government in London that the loss of Kekionga would result in grave economic hardships to Detroit. He estimated that Kekionga annually produced 2000 packs of pelts, worth about £24,000 sterling. This was twice the value of the next most important trade area, between Detroit and Lake Huron.

During the winter of 1789/1790, the traders Henry Hay and John Kinzie stayed in Kekionga. Hay kept a daily journal, which recorded their regular routines of drinking, dancing, and parties, as well as weekly Mass. Hay played the flute and Kinzie played the fiddle, which made them popular with the inhabitants of Kekionga. Although Hay and Kinzie stayed primarily in the French-speaking village in Kekionga, they also described some of the Miami villages. They frequently talked with the chiefs Pacanne, Little Turtle, Blue Jacket, and Le Gris, as well as brothers James, George, and Simon Girty, who lived only three miles away.

The new President of the United States George Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. The large Native American city was important to the British trade economy, and protected a strategic portage between the Great Lakes Basin and Mississippi watershed. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied the request to build a fort there from Northwest Territory governor Arthur St. Clair. St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that &quot;we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.&quot; Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar.

United States General Josiah Harmar was ordered to invade Kekionga. In 1790, his army counted seven distinct villages in the vicinity of Kekionga, known collectively as &quot;the Miami Towns&quot; or Miamitown, in spite of large villages of Shawnee and Delaware also located there. The collected villages of Kekionga had advance knowledge of the army, and most of the people evacuated the area, carrying as many of their food stores as possible. The traders took their trade goods to Fort Detroit, after giving out all their arms and ammunition to the Miami defenders. Major Ebenezer Denny, an officer with the US, drew a map of Kekionga in 1790, which showed a collection of eight distinct villages, surrounded by 500 acres of cornfields. Denny described the rivers with “several little towns on both branches, but the principal one is below the confluence on the north side. Several tolerable good log houses, said to have been occupied by British traders; a few pretty good gardens with some fruit trees and vast fields of corn in almost every direction.”

The United States army burned some villages and food stores, but was forced to retreat after suffering high casualties in a series of battles with forces led by Little Turtle.

The Miami victories over General Harmar&#x27;s army encouraged anti-U.S. sentiment in Kekionga, and United States Secretary of War Henry Knox now decided that a United States fort needed to be built in the area. He ordered Governor St. Clair to attack Kekionga and maintain a presence in the area. That campaign was intercepted long before they reached their destination in what became the Native Americans&#x27; greatest victory over United States forces.

===Decline===

Following the 1790 attacks by Harmar, the Native American confederacy moved their center away from Kekionga, to the Auglaize River.

In 1794, the American General Anthony Wayne led his well-trained Legion of the United States toward Kekionga, but turned and marched toward the British-held Fort Miami near modern-day Toledo, Ohio. Following General Wayne&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, Kekionga&#x27;s prominence began to diminish among the Miami. The Legion arrived at Kekionga on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for the new U.S. fort, which was named for him. It was finished by 17 October, and was capable of withstanding 24-pound cannons. Despite their objections, the Miami lost control of the long portage by the Treaty of Greenville (1795), since the Northwest Ordinance passed by Congress guaranteed free use of important portages in the region. At that time, the Miami claimed the portage brought them $100 per day.

After the construction of Fort Wayne, Kekionga&#x27;s importance to the Miami slowly declined. The Miami village at the Forks of the Wabash (modern Huntington, Indiana) became more prominent. Despite the strong U.S. presence and loss of portage revenue, however, the Miami maintained sovereignty in Kekionga through the War of 1812. Under the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, they were forced to cede this and other central Indiana land in punishment for their not having supported the United States in the war. The site was redeveloped as the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana between 1819 and 1823.

The old name was used for one of the first professional baseball teams, the Fort Wayne Kekiongas. It also appears on Fort Wayne&#x27;s city seal.

<doc id="1183665" wikidata="Q738040" url="?curid=1183665" title="Louis I of Naples">
<text>Louis I (Italian: &quot;Luigi&quot;, &quot;Aloisio&quot;, or &quot;Ludovico&quot; ; 1320 – 26 May 1362), also known as Louis of Taranto, was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou who reigned as King of Naples, Count of Provence and Forcalquier, and Prince of Taranto.

Louis gained the crown of Naples by marrying his half-first cousin/ first cousin-once-removed, Queen Joanna I, whose prior husband, Andrew, had died as a result of a conspiracy that may have involved both of them. Immediately after securing his status as her co-ruler, Louis successfully wrested away all power from his wife, leaving her a sovereign in name only. Their disastrous marriage resulted in the birth of two daughters, Catherine and Frances, neither of whom survived their parents. During their joint reign, Louis dealt with numerous uprisings, attacks, and unsuccessful military operations; he is generally considered an inefficient monarch. Following his death, Joanna resumed her power and refused to share it with her subsequent husbands.

== Background and family ==
A member of the Capetian House of Anjou, Louis was born in Naples as the second son of Philip I, Prince of Taranto, and Catherine II, Latin Empress. He was a patrilineal first cousin once removed of both Queen Joanna I of Naples and her husband Andrew, Duke of Calabria, in addition to being Joanna&#x27;s maternal first cousin. Louis&#x27; older brother Robert, Prince of Taranto, was having an open affair with Queen Joanna. When the 17-year-old Andrew was assassinated on 18 September 1345 for seeking to co-reign with his wife, Joanna was immediately suspected of ordering the murder with the help of Louis and Robert.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, the young queen was strongly influenced by Robert, but by October 1346, she had become closer to Louis. The brothers&#x27; mother died the same month, leaving her claim to the Latin Empire to Robert, who in turn ceded the Principality of Taranto to Louis.

== Marriage ==
Louis and Joanna married in Naples on 22 August 1347, without seeking dispensation from Pope Clement VI – necessary because of their being closely related. The marriage was an attempt to secure the kingdom for Louis rather than to pacify the belligerent branches of the House of Anjou.

=== Ascension to power ===

The couple fled to Provence, which Joanna ruled as countess, after King Louis I of Hungary invaded Naples to avenge the murder of his brother Andrew. They met Clement, feudal overlord of the Kingdom of Naples, in Avignon. To secure his acceptance of their marriage and support against the accusations of Andrew&#x27;s murder, Joanna sold him the city.

The Black Death forced the Hungarians to retreat from Naples in August 1348. Louis and Joanna, who had just had their elder daughter, Catherine, immediately returned to the kingdom. From early 1349 onwards, all documents for the kingdom were issued in the names of both husband and wife, and Louis was indisputably in control of military fortresses. On coins issued during their joint reign, Louis&#x27; name always preceded Joanna&#x27;s. Although he was not officially recognised by Clement as king and co-ruler until 1352, it is likely that Neapolitans considered him their monarch from the moment he started acting as such.

Louis took advantage of the turmoil caused by yet another Hungarian attack to wrest complete royal authority from his wife. He purged the court of her supporters, and struck down her favourite, Enrico Caracciolo, whom he accused of adultery in April 1349 and very likely had executed.

=== Official reign ===

In 1350, the King of Hungary launched another invasion, forcing Louis and Joanna to flee to Gaeta. Louis narrowly defeated Hungarian forces with Pope Clement&#x27;s help. The Pope, however, reprimanded Louis for &quot;treating the Queen as a prisoner and servant&quot;, and agreed to recognise Louis as king and co-ruler only on the condition that he accepted the fact that he held the crown in Joanna&#x27;s right. Their younger daughter, Françoise, was born soon thereafter. Louis received Clement&#x27;s formal recognition as his wife&#x27;s co-ruler in all her realms on 20 or 23 March 1352, and was crowned king alongside her on Pentecost on 25 or 27 May 1352. Françoise, by then the couple&#x27;s only surviving child, died on their coronation day. Louis founded the Order of the Knot on the occasion of the coronation, most likely hoping to enhance the tarnished reputation he shared with Joanna. In 1356, they were crowned in Messina as rulers of Sicily, but failed to capture the entire island, which had been seized from the House of Anjou by the House of Barcelona in 1285 and thereafter ruled as a separate kingdom.

The death of their supporter, Clement VI, was a blow to Louis and Joanna. His successor, Innocent VI, excommunicated them for failing to pay their annual tribute to the Holy See. The issue was resolved by a visit to Avignon in 1360.

Louis&#x27; attempt in 1360 to dethrone Frederick the Simple and regain Sicily ended in a failure, though he did manage to occupy much of the island (including Palermo, the capital) before its barons rebelled. At home, he faced opposition from his and his wife&#x27;s cousins, the House of Anjou-Durazzo, who strongly resented his dominance, with Louis of Gravina stirring revolts in Apulia.

== Death and legacy ==

Louis died, probably of bubonic plague, in Naples on 26 May 1362. Joanna immediately resumed authority in her realms. Although she remarried twice more, to James IV of Majorca and Otto of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, Louis remained the only husband of hers whom she accorded the status of co-monarch. Taranto passed to his younger brother, Philip II. Upon Louis&#x27; death, the order he had created simply dissolved. He was buried in the Territorial Abbey of Montevergine, next to his mother.

Though a chronicler wrote that the &quot;death of Louis of Taranto caused great corruption in all the kingdom&quot;, his contemporaries unanimously thought him to be lacking in both ability and character. Petrarch, familiar with the members of the Neapolitan court, described him as &quot;violent and mendacious, prodigal and avaricious, debauched and cruel&quot;, a person who &quot;knew neither how to make his subjects love him&quot; and who even had no &quot;need of their love&quot;. Louis I&#x27;s greatest achievement was appointing Niccolò Acciaioli as grand seneschal, which provided Naples with a capable administrator and military leader.

His mother was known in the local arts community for her work with the Fort Wayne Ballet. Richard is a 1965 graduate of North Side High School and a 1969 graduate of Princeton University, where he received his B.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. After graduation, he taught at Bishop Dwenger High School.

==Life in politics==

After losing several elections for state representative in the early 1970s, Richard was elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1974 and served until 1978.

In 1976, Richard ran for Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction, but lost to the incumbent, Harold H. Negley by 2.52%.

Afterwards, he continued to be involved in both state and local affairs through his membership on several governmental advisory boards and community service agencies. Richard campaigned in 1999 on a platform of increasing the efficiency and responsiveness of local government.

He was narrowly elected in 1999 over Republican Linda Buskirk, but won his second election with 58% of the vote.

Richard is a great proponent of Six Sigma management techniques, and in 2000, the City of Fort Wayne became the first city government to officially adopt the system.

Richard helped lead Fort Wayne to national recognition for high-performance city services. Results included the lowest crime rate in over 25 years, saving taxpayers more than $31 million using business practices including Lean Six Sigma, and record-breaking investments in downtown development, neighborhoods, and infrastructure while keeping property tax rates at one of the lowest levels since the 1960s. Potholes are filled in less than 4 hours instead of 4 days, and permitting time has been slashed from 48 days to less than 10.

In 2007, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce honored Richard by naming him &quot;Government Leader of the Year.&quot; During Mayor Richard&#x27;s tenure, the City of Fort Wayne won national awards for the #1 Fleet Operation in the nation and the best Public Works and City Utilities Department in the country.

He did not seek re-election in the 2007 city election. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat Tom Henry.

==Post-mayoral work==
Since leaving mayoral office, Graham A. Richard has become a strong advocate for improving local and state government. He helped launch the High Performance Government Network (HPGN) Home and is focusing much of his energy on helping communities become &quot;wired and inspired.&quot;

He has received national awards for his technology leadership, including the Fiber-to-the-Home Council&#x27;s 2005 Star Award for being a leader in broadband technology. He was recognized as one of the top 25 doers, dreamers, and drivers by Government Technology Magazine for his significant contributions to the digital government movement. In addition, the Public Technology Institute awarded Mayor Richard with the 2006 Tech Leader Award. In September 2006, KillerApp magazine recognized then-Mayor Richard with the KillerApp Trailblazer Award for being a leader in broadband services. Graham was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree from Indiana University in 2010.

Graham has become a speaker at national conferences. In December 2005, the Brookings Institution hosted Mayor Richard for a presentation on &quot;Fort Wayne: Wired and Inspired to Compete in the Flat World.&quot; Mayor Richard also addressed the Winter 2006 U.S. Conference of Mayors. Other keynote addresses in 2008 include: the Broadband Properties Summit, the DOD Lean Six Sigma Breakthrough Conference, the Mayors’ Technology Summit, and the Defense Business Agility Forum.

In March 2012, Graham was selected to be the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Energy Economy (AEE). AEE is a national association of businesses working toward a prosperous future based on secure, clean, affordable energy. AEE and partner organizations are active in clean energy policy in over 27 states and with the federal government. AEE has offices in Washington, D.C., Boston, and home offices in San Francisco where Graham currently resides. After almost 6 years as CEO of AEE Graham is now leading the Clean Economy Collaborative. This is an initiative to
help accelerate the Clean Economy in mid size US cities.

==Business==
Over the course of his business career, he operated several small businesses, including the consulting firm Graham Richard Associates LLC and the venture capital firm Ruffolo Richard LLC.

Among other activities, he helped start a cable television company, a public television station, and a small-scale hydropower company. He was also a co-founder of the Fort Wayne Enterprise Center, a business incubator.

He served as the CEO of Advanced Energy Economy from March 2012 to January 2018. Graham is now leading the Clean Economy Collaborative, which is a new initiative to help accelerate the clean economy in midsize cities and communities.

<doc id="1183667" wikidata="Q2484851" url="?curid=1183667" title="William L. Dawson (composer)">
<text>William Levi Dawson (September 26, 1899 – May 2, 1990) was an American composer, choir director, professor, and musicologist.

==Early life and education==

William Levi Dawson was born in Anniston, Alabama in 1899, the first of seven children born to Eliza Starkey Dawson and George W. Dawson. In 1912, he ran away from home to study music full-time as a pre-college student at the historically Black institution Tuskegee Institute (now University) under the tutelage of school president Booker T. Washington. Dawson paid his tuition by working as a music librarian and a manual laborer in the school’s Agricultural Division. He also participated as a member of Tuskegee’s choir, band and orchestra, playing several instruments, composing scores, and traveling with the Tuskegee Singers for five years. Dawson graduated from Tuskegee in 1921.

In 1925, he received a Bachelor of Music in theory at the Horner Institute of Fine Arts in Kansas City, Missouri. He continued his education at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, and graduated in 1927 with a master’s degree in composition.

In addition, Dawson studied composition and orchestration with Henry V. Stearns at Washburn College, counterpoint with Sir Carl Busch in Kansas City, and conducting with Felix Borowski at Chicago Musical College. 

==Career==

Dawson began his teaching career in the Kansas City public school system. He served as first trombonist with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago from 1927 to 1930, and with Redpath Chautauqua.

In 1931, Dawson organized and headed the School of Music at Tuskegee (Institute) University. He would remain on faculty for twenty five years, and during his tenure he appointed a large number of faculty members who later became well known for their work in the field. Additionally, Dawson also developed the Tuskegee Institute Choir into an internationally renowned ensemble; the choir performed for President Herbert Hoover in the White House, for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Hyde Park, and the opening of Radio City Music Hall in New York City. 

Dawson began composing at a young age, and early in his compositional career, his Trio for Violin, Cello, and Piano was performed by the Kansas City Symphony. 

=== &quot;Negro Folk Symphony&quot; ===
In November of 1934, Dawson&#x27;s Negro Folk Symphony was premiered at Carnegie Hall by the Philadelphia Orchestra under the leadership of Leopold Stokowski. Dawson&#x27;s goal was to write a symphony in the Negro Folk Idiom, and in the symphonic form used by European composers of the Romantic-Nationalist School(Dawson). He was greatly inspired by Dvorak and his views on nationalism in music. The entire work mirrors the Negro Spiritual.  The symphony was a huge success and it garnered a great deal of attention from many critics. The success was however short lived. After four back-to-back performances in November, Dawson receded from the headlines, and the symphony was put to rest for 18 years. 

The symphony was revised in 1952 with added African rhythms inspired by the composer&#x27;s trip to West Africa. This new version was recorded by Stokowski and the American Symphony Orchestra in 1963. Dawson said that the composition was an attempt to convey the missing elements that had been lost when Africans came into bondage outside their homeland. The piece would go on to be his only symphony. Following its premiere, it was performed a few times in the span of 18 months before it was forgotten for decades. 

In June 2020, the piece was recorded by the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. It was revived and performed by both the Seattle Symphony (conducted by Roderick Cox, a champion of the work) and Oregon Symphony in 2022, then again in early 2023 by the Los Angeles Philharmonic (with Cox conducting) and the Oakland Symphony. A live recording of the Seattle Symphony&#x27;s performance was released in 2023 alongside works by George Walker. Then, on February 2, 2023, the symphony was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra making it 5th live performance since its premiere, under director Yannick Nezet Seguin. On February 24, 2024, it was again performed by the Las Vegas Philharmonic, under music director Donato Cabrera at The Smith Center for the Performing Arts.

I. &quot;The Bond of Africa&quot;

In the symphony&#x27;s first movement, Dawson uses original melodies in the style of spirituals for the first theme, and for the second theme, he quotes melodies from actual spirituals. According to the composer &quot;a link was taken out of a human chain when the first African was taken from the shores of his native land and sent into slavery. This missing link is represented by a French Horn motif that opens the first movement. This motif can be heard in all three movements of the symphony.

II. &quot;Hope in the Night&quot;

This second movement is the heart of the symphony. It is a heavy movement that gives listeners the space to feel all of the turmoil and pain that African slaves had to endure. It opens with 3 soft strokes of a gong, followed by a melody played by the English Horn. According to the composer, this is meant to represent an &quot;atmosphere of the humdrum life of a people whose bodies were baked by the sun and lashed with the whip for two hundred and fifty years; whose lives were prescribed before they were born&quot;. He uses original melodies for all of the themes of the second movement. After a big swell to its full climax, the music fades into the distance and the drumbeat continues. The slow fade out meant to represent a struggle that never came to a resolution.
III. &quot;O Let Me Shine!&quot;
(“O Le’ Me Shine, Shine Like a Mornin’ Star!”)

For all themes within this movement, Dawson quotes actual spirituals. This movement moves quickly from one idea to the next. In the 2023 performance by the Philadelphia Orchestra, a bell was struck repeatedly towards the end to represent church bells tolling, a prominent motif within African American history. The symphony ends on an ominous note, providing the listener with a sense of incompletion, again meant to represent an unresolved struggle. 

===Choral arrangements===
Besides chamber music, he is also known for his contributions to both orchestral and choral literature. His best-known works are arrangements of and variations on spirituals. His most popular spirituals include &quot;Ezekiel Saw the Wheel,&quot; &quot;Jesus Walked the Lonesome Valley,&quot; &quot;Talk about a Child That Do Love Jesus,&quot; and &quot;King Jesus Is a-Listening.&quot;

Dawson&#x27;s arrangements of traditional African-American spirituals are widely published in the United States and are regularly performed by school, college and community choral programs. According to Dominique-René de Lerma of Lawrence University, in notes to &quot;The Spirituals of William L. Dawson&quot; produced by The St Olaf Choir in 1997, &quot;What is even more striking than the richness of Dawson&#x27;s textures is the lushness of his sonorities, exhibiting his remarkable insight into vocal potentials.&quot;

==Personal==
Dawson married pianist Cornelia Lampton in 1927; she died in 1928.

On September 21, 1935, Dawson married Cecile DeMae Nicholson of Watonga, Oklahoma. Mrs. Dawson owned and operated Le Petite Bazaar, a women&#x27;s clothing shop.

William L. Dawson died on May 2, 1990, at the age of 90 in Montgomery, Alabama. He is buried in the Tuskegee University cemetery.

<text>USS &quot;Monongahela&quot; was a barkentine–rigged screw sloop-of-war that served in the Union Navy during the American Civil War. Her task was to participate in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. Post-war, she continued serving her country in various roles, such as that of a storeship and schoolship.

== Service history ==
===American Civil War===
&quot;Monongahela&quot;—the first United States Navy ship to bear that name—was built by the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was launched on July 10, 1862; sponsored by Ms. Emily V. Hoover, daughter of Naval Constructor Hoover who superintended the ship&#x27;s construction; and commissioned on January 15, 1863, Captain James P. McKinstry in command. Initially assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, &quot;Monongahela&quot; sailed instead to reinforce Rear Admiral David G. Farragut&#x27;s West Gulf Blockading Squadron off Mobile, Alabama, remaining on duty off that port until ordered to attempt to run past Confederate batteries on the Mississippi River at Port Hudson, Louisiana on the night of March 14–15, 1863. As Army forces ashore conducted a mortar bombardment, the squadron got underway about 22:00, heavier ships , , and &quot;Monongahela&quot; screening the smaller , , and from the forts, with steam frigate bringing up the rear.

In the course of the ensuing furious engagement, only &quot;Hartford&quot; and &quot;Albatross&quot; succeeded in passing upriver, &quot;Richmond&quot; losing her steam power early in the battle and drifting downstream out of range with &quot;Genesee&quot; lashed alongside. &quot;Monongahela&quot; grounded under the guns of a heavy battery, taking a pounding and losing six men killed and 21 wounded, including the captain, until she worked loose with &quot;Kineo&quot;″s aid. While attempting to continue upriver, her overloaded engine broke down, and the sloop was forced to drift downstream with &quot;Kineo&quot;. &quot;Mississippi&quot;—grounding at high speed—was hit repeatedly and set afire, eventually blowing up and ending the engagement.

On 27 May, Confederate defenders turned back a major assault on Port Hudson following constant bombardment by &quot;Monongahela&quot;, serving as temporary flagship of Admiral Farragut, and other ships of the squadron. On July 7, the ship, in company with , engaged southern field batteries behind the levee, below Donaldsonville, Louisiana, &quot;Monongahela&quot;″s new skipper Commander Abner Read being killed in this action. She then departed on October 26 for Brazos Santiago, Texas, to support General Nathaniel Banks&#x27; troops in the capture of that town and Brownsville from November 2–4, in addition capturing several blockade runners. &quot;Monongahela&quot; continued her duty off Texas, covering the landing of 1,000 Union troops on Mustang Island, Aransas Pass, Texas on November 16–17 and supporting a Union reconnaissance at Pass Cavallo on the gulf shore of Matagorda Peninsula from December 31, 1863, to January 1, 1864. She returned to blockade off Mobile, soon after, stopping numerous blockade runners throughout the spring and summer of 1864.

On July 15, the warship&#x27;s boats conducted a reconnaissance of the Mobile Bay area to determine the Confederate torpedo (naval mines) defenses; and then on August 3, Admiral Farragut took his stripped-for-action squadron of 18 ships, including four monitors, against those defenses. In the fierce fight and great victory that followed, &quot;Monongahela&quot; bombarded Confederate forts and then rammed the heavy Confederate ram . The sloop succeeded only in damaging herself in the full speed drive into the armored enemy ship, but combined heavy gunfire from the other Union ships forced the Confederate warship to surrender, ending the battle and closing the last major gulf port to the South. &quot;Monongahela&quot; remained on duty with the West Gulf squadron until the end of the Civil War.

===Post-war career===
Post-war, &quot;Monongahela&quot; was assigned to the West Indies Squadron. While on service with the West Indies Squadron, the warship had the unique experience of being landed high and dry 91 meters inland from the shoreline when a tsunami struck Frederiksted, St. Croix on November 18, 1867. Following an earthquake, and probable submarine landslide from the 15,000&#x27; deep trench to the North, she was hit by a wall of water high and carried over the beach and warehouses to come to rest on an even keel some distance from the water. A working party of mechanics from New York Navy Yard under Naval Constructor Thomas Davidson succeeded in refloating the ship on May 11, 1868, following a four-month endeavor. &quot;Monongahela&quot; was towed to New York City and thence to Portsmouth where she was slowly repaired, finally departing in 1873 to join the South Atlantic Station.

Following a three-year cruise on that duty, the steam sloop served as a training ship off the east coast and then departed for the Asiatic Station, serving in the Far East until the need of repairs took her to Mare Island Navy Yard in 1879 where she decommissioned. In 1883, the veteran warship was converted to a supply ship, with all her machinery being removed that fall to make additional room for supplies. During the conversion, her rig was changed to bark to allow her handling by a smaller crew. &quot;Monongahela&quot; continued her duty in the Pacific Squadron as storeship at Callao, Peru in 1890, and then sailed around Cape Horn to Portsmouth Navy Yard to be fitted out as an apprentice training ship. Emerging from the refit a full-rigged ship, the old converted sloop joined the Training Squadron in 1891, serving in that capacity until relieving on May 15, 1894, as U.S. Naval Academy Practice Ship. Making annual cruises each year except for 1898, when the war with Spain intervened, the ship conducted her last Academy cruise from June 6 – September 4, 1899, sailing to England and Portugal.

Upon completion of this cruise, the &quot;Monongahela&quot; became a training ship for apprentices at the Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. She served for three years in that capacity and cruised to ports throughout Europe&#x27;s Atlantic coast and the Caribbean. Finally detached from the Atlantic Training Squadron on May 9, 1904, the old warship served as a storeship at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba until totally destroyed by fire on March 17, 1908. A 4-inch breech-loading gun was salvaged from &quot;Monongahela&quot;&#x27;s wreck and put on display at the Naval Station. Since the gun was slightly deformed by the heat from the fire, it was nicknamed &quot;Ole Droopy&quot;. This gun is now on display on Deer Point near the Bay Club.

<text>John Neville Figgis (2 October 1866 – 13 April 1919) was an English historian, political philosopher, and Anglican priest and monk of the Community of the Resurrection.

== Life ==
He was born in Brighton on 2 October 1866. Educated at Brighton College and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, he was a student of Lord Acton at Cambridge, and editor of much of Acton&#x27;s work.

He is remembered in relation to the history of ideas and concepts of the pluralist state. The latter he in some ways adapted from Otto von Gierke; his ideas were picked up by others, such as G. D. H. Cole and Harold Laski. Some of the books which belonged to Figgis form part of the Mirfield Collection which is housed in the University of York Special Collections.

He was professed in the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield in 1909. He died on 13 April 1919 in Virginia Water.

<text>Wah Ming Chang (August 2, 1917 – December 22, 2003) was an American designer, sculptor, and artist. With the encouragement of his adoptive father, James Blanding Sloan, he began exhibiting his prints and watercolors at the age of seven to highly favorable reviews. Chang worked with Sloan on several theatre productions and in the 1940s, they briefly created their own studio to produce films. He is known later in life for his sculpture and the props he designed for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, including the tricorder and communicator.

== Early life ==
The Chang family moved from Honolulu, Hawaii to San Francisco, California and about 1920 opened the Ho-Ho Tea Room on Sutter Street, which became a favorite venue for the city&#x27;s Bohemian artists. Wah-Ming&#x27;s mother, Fai Sue Chang, was a graduate of Berkeley&#x27;s California School of Arts and Crafts (today&#x27;s California College of the Arts), where she specialized in fashion design and etching. 

After she died in 1927, her husband persuaded Wah Ming Chang&#x27;s art teacher and family friend James Blanding Sloan, and his wife Mildred Taylor, to become his son&#x27;s legal guardians. Sloan exhibited Wah Ming&#x27;s etchings and watercolors in public exhibitions as early as 1925 to favorable reviews in the San Francisco Bay Area and later in the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast, Carmel-by-the-Sea. The child became part of Sloan&#x27;s family, traveled in 1926 to Taos, New Mexico, for the on-site study of American Indian culture, and in 1928 displayed his block prints in joint exhibitions with Sloan at the prestigious Philadelphia Print Club and in Pasadena, California.

== Career ==
He became a valued assistant in several of Sloan&#x27;s marionette theatres as well as in productions for the Hollywood Bowl Ballet and the &quot;Cavalcade of Texas.&quot; In the mid-1940s Chang formed a joint studio business with Sloan, The East-West Film Company, and produced such memorable films as &quot;Pick a Bale of Cotton&quot; (an interview and performance with the legendary blues and folk singer Lead Belly in 1944) and the highly controversial anti-war short (1946–47), &quot;The Way of Peace&quot;, created in part with elaborate miniature sets and puppets in stop-motion.

For &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Chang built costumes for the salt vampire (&quot;The Man Trap&quot;), the Gorn (&quot;Arena&quot;) and Balok&#x27;s false image (&quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot;). He created tribbles by using artificial fur stuffed with foam, the Neanderthals in &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;, and the Romulan Bird of Prey (&quot;Balance of Terror&quot;), and the Vulcan harp first seen in &quot;Charlie X&quot; and later seen in &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;, &quot;Amok Time&quot;, &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;; and &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;. Chang is mistakenly credited with having designed the phaser; it was actually designed by the Art Director of the original series, Matt Jefferies. The Desilu prop department prepared a single &quot;hero&quot; working model phaser, deemed unacceptable by Gene Roddenberry; Wah Chang prepared additional working and dummy mockups of the phaser, as well as other principal props. A Desilu invoice dated August 22, 1966, shows Chang &quot;reworking phasers&quot; for $520.00.

 Chang&#x27;s communicator design has been credited as an inspiration for modern flip-type cell phones. His Balok effigy was used in &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode — and at the conclusion of many closing credits sequences of the series.

His other film credits include sculpting the maquette of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; which was used as the reference for the animators of the classic Walt Disney feature, and articulated deer models for &quot;Bambi&quot;. He designed the spectacular headdress worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the feature film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Other work included building the time machine and sphinx from 1960s movie &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and the dragon (seen only in the English-dubbed version) of &quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot; (1960). Chang&#x27;s firm, Project Unlimited, Inc., would win Academy Award recognition for its special effects, but Chang was not listed on the award, due to the way the credits were submitted to the academy. Film historian Bob Burns reported that Chang did not object to this. &quot;He was the most humble, gentle man I&#x27;ve ever known in my life,&quot; Burns said. &quot;He never boasted about anything he did, and he just did remarkable stuff.&quot;

In addition, Chang built the artificial creature in &quot;The Architects of Fear&quot; episode of the original &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, some props for the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film, the frightening skeleton animated in &quot;The Power&quot;, the flying machine in &quot;The Master of the World&quot;, and the dinosaurs in &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;.

Chang&#x27;s work as a stop-motion animator through the effects company Centaur Productions, operated with fellow artist Gene Warren, has been enjoyed for years in the cartoons &quot;Hardrock, Coco and Joe&quot; and &quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot;.

== Later life ==
Chang moved with his wife, Glenella Taylor, to Carmel Valley, California, in 1970, where he joined the Carmel Art Association and began producing bronze sculptures of wildlife and endangered species. 

In 1941, Wah Ming was diagnosed with polio following flu-like symptoms. After an extended stay at the Twin Oaks Sanitarium hospital in San Gabriel, California, and treatments that included confinement in an iron lung. He eventually would walk again, but for the rest of his life, never had enough strength in his lungs to be able to blow up a balloon.

While his earlier creative efforts were concerned with special effects and film related wonders, his more mature artistic creations were delightful bronze sculptures and whimsical statuary. The latter ranged from a life-sized 3.5 foot tall Dennis the Menace, commissioned by creator Hank Ketcham and displayed in Dennis Park in Monterey, California, to the smaller statues such as &quot;Girl and Frog&quot;, which is owned by a private collector in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Chang died on December 22, 2003, in Carmel Valley at age 86. A public memorial service was held at the Community Church of the Monterey Peninsula in Carmel.

==Documentaries==
Chang produced the educational 1970 short film &quot;Dinosaurs: The Terrible Lizards&quot;, a stop-motion feature which discussed life in the Mesozoic Era. It would later gain a &quot;Revised Edition&quot; in 1986.

Chang appeared in the documentary &quot;The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal&quot; (1985) (Produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit).

Mr. Chang was featured in the documentary &quot;Time Machine: The Journey Back&quot; (1993), produced and directed by Clyde Lucas.

== Sculptures ==
Chang produced bronze sculptures in collaboration with Henry &quot;Bob&quot; Jones after meeting at Disney.

<doc id="1183689" wikidata="Q465956" url="?curid=1183689" title="Phil Neal">
<text>Philip George Neal (born 20 February 1951) is an English retired footballer who played for Northampton Town, Liverpool and Bolton Wanderers as a full-back. He is regarded as one of the most successful English players of all time, having won eight First Division titles, four League Cups, five FA Charity Shields, four European Cups, one UEFA Cup and one UEFA Super Cup during his eleven years at Liverpool. He later returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager, leading them to victory in the Football League Trophy before spells managing Coventry City, Cardiff City and Manchester City.

Neal also had a long career with the England national team, winning 50 caps and playing in the 1982 World Cup. He would go on to be England&#x27;s assistant manager under Graham Taylor.

Neal&#x27;s nickname whilst at Liverpool was Zico – a reference to the Brazilian play maker and a compliment to Neal, who was known for scoring important goals throughout the club&#x27;s history. His son, Ashley Neal, also became a footballer.

==Career==
===Playing career===

Neal began his playing career at Wellingborough Town, before he joined Northampton Town in 1967. He went on to make 187 appearances for the club before being signed on 9 October 1974 for £66,000 by Liverpool manager Bob Paisley. Paisley had intended to break Neal in as a replacement for the ageing Chris Lawler, meaning that he initially played as a left-back. It would be, however, his industrious and energetic performances at right-back where he made his name.

Neal made his Liverpool debut in the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on 16 November 1974, a game which ended 0–0. Neal made his debut alongside midfielder Terry McDermott. Neal&#x27;s first goal for the club came almost exactly one year later on 4 November 1975, during the 6–0 defeat of Real Sociedad in a UEFA Cup game at Anfield. 

Neal scored from the penalty spot late in the 1977 European Cup Final, when the Anfield club beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 in Rome to win the European Cup for the first time. Neal subsequently played in the winning 1978 and 1981 finals, Liverpool beating Club Brugge and Real Madrid respectively. He scored in the first half of the 1984 final against A.S. Roma, which ended 1–1 and was decided on penalty kicks, won by Liverpool (with Neal scoring Liverpool&#x27;s first goal of the shootout, from its second shot). Neal was the only player to appear in all four of Liverpool&#x27;s European Cup wins of the 1970s and 1980s.

In total, Neal won eight First Divisions, four League Cups, five FA Charity Shields, four European Cups, one UEFA Cup and one UEFA Super Cup during his eleven years at Liverpool, making him one of the most successful Englishmen ever to play the game. During his Liverpool career, Neal was ever-present in the starting line-up for several seasons. He played 366 consecutive league matches (a club record and among the highest in English football history) from 14 December 1974 until 24 September 1983, when he suffered an injury against Manchester United that forced him to miss the following week&#x27;s match against Sunderland.

Neal departed Anfield after 11 years in 1985, joining Bolton Wanderers as player-manager. He retired from playing in 1989 after more than 700 league appearances and 50 caps for England.

===Managerial career===
In December 1985, Neal was appointed player-manager of Bolton Wanderers and managed the club for seven years. During this period, Neal led the club to win the Football League Trophy in 1989, although the club would later suffer relegation to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history. They won promotion back to the Third Division the following season, reaching the Third Division play-offs in 1990 and 1991 but failed to win promotion on either occasion. In 1991, they had been pipped to automatic promotion by Grimsby Town on goal difference, and lost to Tranmere Rovers in the playoff final. A year later, they finished 13th in the Third Division and Neal was sacked on 8 May 1992. His successor was Bruce Rioch, who guided Bolton to promotion from the newly named Division Two (rebranded as part of a reorganisation prompted by the creation of the FA Premier League) in 1993 and to the top flight in 1995.

Neal returned to club management on 23 October 1993 with Coventry City, beginning his spell at Highfield Road on that day with a 5–1 defeat against QPR that left them 12th in the Premier League. Despite a shaky start to his time as Sky Blues manager, they did well in the second half of the season and finished 11th in the league – their highest finish since coming seventh in 1989. Perhaps the most impressive result that season after Neal&#x27;s arrival was a 4–0 home win over Manchester City on 19 February 1994. However, Coventry struggled in 1994–95 despite the £2million arrival of striker Dion Dublin from Manchester United on 10 September, and Neal was sacked on 14 February 1995 despite a 2–0 away win over fellow strugglers Crystal Palace three days earlier, which saw them 17th in the Premier League and two places above the relegation zone. Neal&#x27;s successor Ron Atkinson ensured City&#x27;s survival.

He was appointed manager of Cardiff City in Division Three in February 1996, but in October that year he left Ninian Park to become assistant manager to Steve Coppell at Manchester City who were struggling in Division One after relegation from the Premier League. However, Coppell resigned on 8 November 1996 and Neal became caretaker manager until the arrival of Frank Clark on 29 December.

For the 1997–98 season, Neal was recruited as assistant manager to chairman-manager Barry Fry at Peterborough United after their relegation to Division Three, but he was axed by Fry on 15 March 1998.

He has also played for and coached the Liverpool masters side which dominated the Sky Sports Masters series.

==Media==

In recent years, Neal has worked as a football pundit for various television and radio organisations.

He has written two autobiographies, &quot;Attack from the Back&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Life at the Kop&quot; in 1986.

<doc id="1183692" wikidata="Q5635133" url="?curid=1183692" title="HM Prison Barwon">
<text>HM Prison Barwon or informally Barwon Prison, an Australian high risk and maximum security prison for males, is located from the township of Lara, near Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The facility is operated by Corrections Victoria. The prison provides accommodation and services for remand and sentenced prisoners detained under Victorian and Federal legislation.

Barwon Prison is located adjacent to the 559-bed medium security Marngoneet Correctional Centre, opened in 2006.

== History ==
Barwon was built to cater for demand due to the recent closures of HM Prison Geelong in 1991 and HM Prison Pentridge in 1997.

Construction of the prison commenced in 1986. The works were carried out by Thiess Contractors. It was completed in October 1989 and the first prisoners were received in January 1990. Barwon is the only Victorian maximum security prison located outside the Melbourne metropolitan area.

== Accommodation units ==
Barwon provides accommodation and services for maximum security mainstream prisoners including a 20-bed facility for high security prisoners and a 60-bed facility for maximum security protection prisoners. A campus of the Box Hill Institute of TAFE operates at the prison providing a corrections education program.

The prison is split into many separate units including:
*&quot;Acacia&quot;a high security management unit that is used to accommodate high risk prisoners. This unit can hold up to 24 prisoners in 4 separate areas, and is the oldest management unit within the prison.
*&quot;Banksia&quot;a management unit for prisoners requiring close supervision or protection. All cells in this unit are single cells. 
*&quot;Hoya&quot;a protection unit which houses prisoners who, due to the nature of their crimes, are considered as at risk being housed alongside mainstream prisoners. Initially built as a demountable structure, this unit has remained as a permanent structure and is separated from all the other units.
*&quot;Cassia&quot;a mainstream unit which is classed as the reception unit for mainstream prisoners. This unit features both single and double cells and can house up to 80 prisoners.
*&quot;Diosma&quot;a mainstream unit which is seen as a first stop after Cassia, and houses prisoners who don&#x27;t have lengthy sentences.
*&quot;Eucalypt&quot;a mainstream unit used to house older, more settled long term prisoners.
*&quot;Grevillea&quot;opened in April 2003, housing segregation prisoners. This unit housed protection prisoners until mid 2015, when its prisoners were transferred to make way for the incoming prisoners involved in the Metropolitan Remand Centre Riots. In early 2016 it was classified as a restricted regime unit, a stepping stone for prisoners transitioning out of high security units into mainstream units. In late 2016 it was again reclassified as a youth justice centre, to house 16 and 17 year olds after the loss of half of the Melbourne Youth Justice Precinct at Parkville.
*&quot;Illawarra&quot;was initially a mainstream unit for prisoners classified as Medium Security. Since 2016 has been used as a remand unit, housing prisoners yet to be convicted or sentenced, and as such offering more incentives such as longer let out hours and facilities. This unit is also a demountable building that has remained permanent and has the ability to be separated from the mainstream units because it is internally fenced and gated.
*&quot;Melaleuca&quot;a high security unit that is used to accommodate high risk prisoners. This unit was opened in 2007 and can accommodate 24 prisoners in single cells, separated into 4 different areas.
*&quot;Olearia&quot;the newest High Security unit at the prison, officially opened on 10 August 2016 and accepting prisoners from 22 August 2016. The 36 million dollar expansion is officially a prison within a prison, separated from the rest of Barwon and housing its own visits centre and medical wing. The maximum security unit can hold up to 40 prisoners in single cells, including 20 that have their own small exercise yards for prisoners who cannot mix with others.

==Incidents==

In April 2010, convicted Melbourne gangland murderer and drug dealer Carl Williams was beaten to death inside the Acacia Unit by fellow prisoner Matthew Johnson.

A 2012 art exhibition called &quot;The Barwon Interviews&quot;, comprising video footage of twelve inmates, was part of a Monash University PhD project that was focused on examining prisoners adjusting to life inside Barwon Prison, their family struggles, and guilty consciences.

In February 2012, while visiting Barwon Prison to speak to Indigenous inmates as part of a mentoring program, former AFL player Wayne Carey was found to have traces of cocaine on his clothing following a routine drug scan. Carey was informed that he could enter the prison if he submitted to a strip search. He declined and left the correctional facility.

In November 2014, a prisoner strapped a homemade explosive device to his body. The device was made partly from ground up matchheads and triggered a lockdown in the facility. Victoria Police specialist teams including the Critical Incident Response Team and the Bomb Squad were brought in to deal with the prisoner, who was subsequently charged and received extra time on his sentence.

In October 2015, several prison officers were injured in an unprovoked attack in the Grevillea unit of the prison. Two prisoners assaulted the officers as they were being led back to their cells from exercise.

On 11 February 2019, two members of Barwon Prison&#x27;s Pacific Islander &#x27;G-fam&#x27; group stood over Tony Mokbel and stabbed him with an improvised knife. He also received a fractured skull and loss of teeth in the attack. It is likely that the attack was a result of the previous day&#x27;s newspaper headline story, that Mokbel was being an &#x27;enforcer&#x27; within the prison and one of the men also accused the drug kingpin of &quot;talking to the screws, you f***ing dog!&quot;

<doc id="1183693" wikidata="Q1720081" url="?curid=1183693" title="Scott Quinnell">
<text>Scott Quinnell (born 20 August 1972) is a Welsh former dual-code rugby union and rugby league player who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He was a number 8 for Wales, Llanelli RFC, Llanelli Scarlets, Richmond and the British &amp; Irish Lions in rugby union. He won 52 caps for Wales (seven as captain) and three for the Lions, and scored 11 international tries for Wales and one for the Lions.

In 1994 he changed rugby football codes from rugby union to rugby league when he transferred from Llanelli RFC to Wigan, and played two seasons, winning a league championship and two caps for Wales.

==Biography==
Scott was born in Morriston, Swansea, Glamorgan, Wales. He is the son of former Welsh international Derek Quinnell. His two brothers Craig and Gavin played professional rugby union. Gavin lost the sight in one eye after an incident in a 2010 match. The brothers are also nephews of Welsh international Barry John, and Quinnell&#x27;s godfather was Mervyn Davies.

===Early career===
Quinnell first joined the Llanelli juniors aged 8 and he made his début as an 18-year-old back in 1990 against Pen-y-groes. He went on to represent Llanelli on 146 occasions, scoring 69 tries.

Quinnell first played for Wales as a blindside flanker in a 26–24 defeat against Canada in 1993. He was part of the 1994 Five Nations-winning Welsh team and was man of the match in Wales&#x27; 24–15 victory over France that year with a try and a breakaway to set up another try.

===Rugby league===
He switched to rugby league in 1994, joining Wigan. He stayed with Wigan for two years, and during this time he won the league. Quinnell played loose forward in Wigan&#x27;s 25–16 victory over St. Helens in the 1996 Regal Trophy final. He also represented Wales in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. He said that the toughest game of rugby he ever played was the quarter-final against Western Samoa. Wales went out to England 25–10 in the semi-finals.

===Return to union===
Quinnell returned to rugby union with Richmond in 1996. He was selected for the 1997 Lions tour of South Africa. but a double hernia operation forced him to leave the tour and he was replaced by Tony Diprose.

He came back to his beloved Stradey Park in 1998. During the 1998–99 season he did no conditioning work at all as he had rheumatoid arthritis in his left knee. For seven years he played through the pain barrier with the condition that seemed likely to end his career.

He was part of a Welsh team that won eight straight games before the 1999 World Cup and then reached the World Cup quarter-finals where they went out 24–9 to the eventual winners Australia. He captained Wales for the first time in a 23–13 defeat by South Africa at the Millennium Stadium. Quinnell played his last game for Wales as a replacement in a 32–21 win over Canada in 2002 after winning 52 caps.

He was again selected for the 2001 Lions tour to Australia where he played in all three tests, and scored a try in the first test in Brisbane.

After the Welsh domestic game went regional in 2003, he appeared 59 times for the Scarlets, scoring 32 tries. He was part of the Llanelli Scarlets team that won the Celtic League title in 2004.
Quinnell announced his retirement from rugby union at the end of the 2004–05 season in order to concentrate on his role as coach of the Llanelli RFC Welsh Premier Division team. A hand injury suffered in March 2005 forced him to end his career a few weeks prematurely. He played his final game in a testimonial match with fellow retiree Rob Howley at the Millennium Stadium. Quinnell&#x27;s Britain &amp; Ireland selection lost 57–67 to Howley&#x27;s Rest of the World side.

===After retirement===
Quinnell currently regularly appears as a commentator and pundit on a number of Sky Sports televised rugby matches. He is also a People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery ambassador and appears on the adverts. He is a co-presenter and coach (with Will Greenwood) of Sky&#x27;s &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; TV series. He has had a recurring guest role as himself in the Sky 1 TV comedy series &quot;Stella&quot;. In 2017 he co-wrote (with psychologist Paul Boross) the book &quot;Leader On The Pitch&quot;, with a foreword written by Sir Clive Woodward.

In 2020, he participated in (&#x27;Language Road Trip&#x27;), a show for S4C where he and several other celebrities learned Welsh, broadcast in April 2020. An extra episode, (&#x27;Language Road Trip: Christmas&#x27;) was broadcast at the end of 2020, interviewing each of the celebrities about whether they were still making use of their Welsh and the opportunities they had had to use Welsh during lockdown.

===Personal life===
Quinnell is married to Nicola, and the couple have three children. Having lived all of his life in Llanelli, in early 2009 in light of his increased media commitments, the family moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire, although they have since moved back to South Wales to a smallholding near Usk.

Quinnell is dyslexic, but was not diagnosed until his early 30s, when his lack of ability to read and write was correctly diagnosed. Having undertaken a series of therapies to resolve the condition, as of 2010, Quinnell is a popular speaker on the matter. He has represented the Welsh Dyslexia Project, and also completed an autobiography as part of the Accent Press Quick Reads series.

In August 2007 Quinnell was treated for serious injuries after slipping whilst entering a shower and falling through a glass shower door at his then home near Llanelli. He was taken to West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen with a severed right triceps, and glass embedded in his right arm, hand and knee.

In 2017, Quinnell published a book on business leadership with Paul Boross.

<text>John Paul &quot;Jak&quot; Housden (born 12 June 1969) is an Australian guitarist, singer, and composer. Best known as a long-standing member of or The Whitlams, he is also a founding member of The Badloves, appearing on all their classic 1990s releases. A revered session guitarist, Jak has performed and recorded with Barry Gibb, Olivia Newton-John, Richard Clapton, Steve Kilbey, Kate Ceberano, Jimmy Barnes, Daryl Braithwaite, and Steve Balbi. Since 2015, Jak has been involved with Tim Minchin, touring extensively and recording on the album &quot;Apart Together&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Jak Housden has played guitar since he was 11 years old. He joined Melbourne band, Show of Hands, at 16, performing regularly around Melbourne, even flying to Tokyo to represent Australia in Yamaha&#x27;s &quot;Band Explosion&quot; at the Budokan Stadium. In 1988, Housden began a spell of touring with Daryl Braithwaite. Also in the band, at the time, was Stephen O&#x27;Prey on bass guitar (also ex-Show of Hands) and Michael Spiby on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Screen Idols).

Housden, O&#x27;Prey, and Spiby (now on lead vocals) founded the Badloves in Melbourne with Chris Tabone on drums and initially Spiby&#x27;s brother, John, on keyboards and saxophone. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they &quot;became a popular live attraction courtesy of regular gigs and a fine set of laid-back, 1970s-styled blues, Memphis soul and New Orleans R&amp;B material. The band&#x27;s sound was simple, soulful and very funky. The Badloves were immediately labelled as &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;neo-hippies&#x27; and &#x27;retro&#x27;, which may have been the case, but at least it showed a band working within a rich musical tradition.&quot; The group released two studio albums, &quot;Get on Board&quot; (June 1993) and &quot;Holy Roadside&quot; (September 1995), before disbanding in 1997.

In 1999, Jak was one of the session musicians on the Whitlams fourth studio album, &quot;Love This City&quot;. In 2001, he became a permanent band member, touring and recording the albums &quot;Torch the Moon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Little Cloud&quot; (2006), alongside founding mainstay lead vocalist and pianist, Tim Freedman, bass guitarist, Warwick Hornby and drummer, Terepai Richmond. In February 2022, The Whitlams released their first album in 16 years, &quot;Sancho&quot;. Housden has remained a member of the Whitlams.

== Solo material and other projects ==

Housden released his self-produced debut solo album, &quot;Mad About Disco&quot;, in 2004 through Boffin Records, which included the single, &quot;To Die For&quot; (2005). In 2020, Housden released the single &quot;Bombs&quot; on Triplespeak. Strong on melody, &quot;Bombs&quot; is a stomper with intoxicating harmonies, and the psychedelic guitar for which Housden has become famous. Produced by Housden, &quot;Bombs&quot; was mastered at Abbey Road Studios.

Housden has played in numerous bands including Clayton Doley (Hammond organ) Organ Donors and the Sydney psychedelic band, The Dolly Rocker Movement. in recent times, Jak has featured in various music videos for Tim Minchin, including &#x27;15 Minutes&#x27; and &#x27;Leaving LA&#x27;. 

Housden&#x27;s film &amp; television credits include the Emmy Award-winning animated Beatles series, &quot;Beatbugs&quot;, for which Jak recorded on tracks featuring Rod Stewart, Chris Cornell and Regina Spektor. And in 2017, he was the guitarist and Music Advisor on the critically acclaimed ABC biopic &quot;Friday On My Mind - The Story of The Easybeats&quot;. 

===Genre and style===

Housden is renowned for his bendy guitar style and highly distinctive tone, as well as his fervent falsetto vocals. He draws upon 1960s and &#x27;70s influences including The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and west coast rock bands like The Byrds and Jefferson Airplane.

==Personal life==

Jak Housden is married to singer and performer Robyn Loau, is the brother of Stephen Housden, the lead guitarist of Little River Band, and the uncle of composer Paul Housden, who was part of the now-defunct Pornland.

<doc id="1183712" wikidata="Q127170" url="?curid=1183712" title="Hazael">
<text>Hazael (; ) was a king of Aram-Damascus mentioned in the Bible. Under his reign, Aram-Damascus became an empire that ruled over large parts of contemporary Syria and Israel-Samaria. While he was likely born in the greater Damascus region of today, his place of birth is unknown, with both Bashan and the Beqaa Valley being favoured by different historians.

==In the Bible==

Hazael is first mentioned by name in . God tells Elijah the prophet to anoint Hazael king of Syria. Years after this, the Syrian king Ben-Hadad II, probably identical to the Hadadezer mentioned in the Tel Dan stele, was ill and sent his court official Hazael with gifts to Elijah&#x27;s successor, Elisha. Elisha told Hazael to tell Hadadezer that he would recover and revealed to Hazael that the king would recover but would die another way. He also predicted that Hazael would commit atrocities against the Israelites. Hazael denies that he is capable of perpetrating such deeds. Elisha predicts that Hazael will be king of Syria; he returns to Damascus the next day and tells Hadadezer he will recover but suffocates Hadadezer and seizes power himself.

During his reign (c. 842–800 BCE), King Hazael led the Arameans in a battle against the allied forces of Jehoram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah. After defeating them at Ramoth-Gilead, Hazael repelled two attacks by the Assyrians, seized Israelite territory east of the Jordan River, and the Philistine city of Gath. Although unsuccessful, he also sought to take Jerusalem (). Hazael&#x27;s death is mentioned in .

==Tel Dan stele==
A monumental Aramaic inscription discovered at Tel Dan is seen by most scholars as having been erected by Hazael, after he defeated the kings of Israel and Judah. Recent excavations at Tell es-Safi/Gath have revealed dramatic evidence of the siege and subsequent conquest of Gath by Hazael. An archaeomagnetic study has suggested that the sites of Tell Zeitah, Tel Rehov and Horvat Tevet were destroyed by Hazael&#x27;s campaign.

==Items belonging to Hazael==

===Bronze plaques===

Decorated bronze plaques from chariot horse-harness taken from Hazael, identified by their inscriptions, have been found as re-gifted votive objects at two Greek sites, the Heraion of Samos and in the temple of Apollo at Eretria on Euboea. The inscriptions read &quot;that which Hadad gave to our lord Hazael from &#x27;Umq in the year that our lord crossed the River&quot;. The river must be the Orontes. The triangular front pieces show a &quot;Master of the animals&quot; gripping inverted sphinxes or lions in either hand, and with goddesses who stand on the heads of lions. When Tiglath-Pileser III took Damascus in 733/2, these heirlooms were part of the loot that fell eventually into Greek, probably Euboean hands.

===Arslan Tash ivories===
A set of ivory bed decorations were found in 1928 in Arslan Tash in northern Syria (ancient Hadātu) by a team of French archaeologists. Among them is the Arslan Tash ivory inscription in Old Aramaic that carries the name &#x27;Hazael&#x27;; this bed seems to have belonged to king Hazael of Aram-Damascus. The inscription is known as KAI 232.

Also, some fragmentary ivories mentioning Hazael were found in Nimrud, Iraq.

<text>The laava phere (Punjabi: ਲਾਵਾਂ ਫੇਰੇ ; singular laav; ਲਾਵਾਂ), also known as Lavan&quot;&quot;, are the four hymns of the &quot;Anand Karaj&quot; (Sikh wedding ceremony) which form the main part of the wedding ceremony. The four hymns are from the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy scriptures and appear on Ang 773 to 774 of the total of 1430. The Laavaan Shabad was written by the Fourth Guru, Guru Ram Das.

Guru Amar Das Ji explains in Ang 788 of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib the meaning of marriage to a Sikh couple: &quot;They are not said to be husband and wife who merely sit together. Rather they alone are called husband and wife, who have one soul in two bodies.&quot; 

The four laava give the Sikh couple spiritual guidance for their life ahead. The Guru tells of the four spiritual stages of married life and how the couple as a team have to first begin by following the path of righteousness and sinless-ness. Secondly to only have fear of the Lord and remove the ego from within the souls; then to remember and sing the Lord&#x27;s name with the holy congregation. Finally, the couple will find divine peace; come to accept the Will of the Lord and find unending happiness in the Lord.

== Meanings ==

The main part of the Anand Karaj (Sikh Marriage Ceremony) is the reading and then the singing of each laav. While the laav is sung, the couple, joined by a piece of cloth, circle the Guru Granth Sahib. When the couple circle the Guru Granth Sahib each time they are making a commitment to God with the Guru as their spiritual witness and support. The couple is reminded that the Guru should be the center of their lives &quot;. The Sri Guru Granth Sahib is the spiritual center and the Sadh Sangat is the worldly (temporal) witness and support.

The four nuptial rounds were written by Guru Ram Das for his own wedding. They explain the journey of the souls toward the Almighty. In them he tells us of the duties that a person undertaking a life of marriage should perform. In the first round, the Guru asks the partners to:

* Commit to righteousness.
* Renounce sinful actions.
* Remember, mediate and embrace Naam.
* Only by good fortune, is real peace obtained and Lord seems sweet to the mind.
* Worship the one Waheguru and all your sins will vanish.

In the second round, the Guru asks the partners to advance further towards meeting the True Guru - God:

* The Lord leads you to meet the True Guru, the Primal Being - the enlightener
* Have fear of fearless God and your ego will disappear
* Sing God&#x27;s praises and feel God&#x27;s presence before you.
* God is everywhere, outside and within, sing in Joy

In the third round, the Guru says that the partners mind is filled with &quot;Divine Love&quot;:

* Meeting the Sadh Sangat (Holy Congregation)
* Speak the Word of the Lord&#x27;s Bani.
* Which is only obtained by good fortune
* Recite Gurbani and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
* The Naam will vibrate and resound within your heart
* And you will know your future destiny.

In the final round, the Guru says that the partners mind become peaceful and they will have found the Lord:

* God&#x27;s Will seems sweet to these Gurmukhs.
* You will lovingly focus your consciousness on the Lord, day and night
* All your desires will be fulfilled
* The Souls will blend with Waheguru and only Naam will occupy your heart.

<text>William Johnston Dawson (1765 – January 16, 1796) was a U.S. Congressman from the state of North Carolina from 1793 to 1795 and a member of the North Carolina House of Commons.

==Early life==
Dawson was born near Edenton in Chowan County, North Carolina. His grandfather was royal Governor Gabriel Johnston. He was also the grandson of William Dawson, the second president of The College of William &amp; Mary, and a great-great grandson of John Stith and William Randolph.

== Political career==
Dawson represented Bertie County in the state constitutional conventions of 1788 and 1789. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons (now called the House of Representatives) in 1791 and was a member of the committee which was appointed to choose a site for the new state capital, Raleigh, that same year. Dawson Street in downtown Raleigh is named for him. Dawson was elected to the 3rd United States Congress in the election of February 15, 1793, a three-way race in which he, as the Anti-Federalist candidate, defeated two Federalists: Stephen Cabarrus (Speaker of the State House) and William Cumming. Dawson served from March 4, 1793 to March 3, 1795. He lost his race for re-election on February 13, 1795 to Dempsey Burges.

==Death==
Dawson died in Bertie County, North Carolina. His obituary, printed in the &quot;North Carolina Journal&quot; on February 1, 1796, stated that Dawson died on January 16, 1796 but the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, which lists his middle name as &quot;Johnson,&quot; puts his death at 1798.

<text>Road &amp; Track (stylized as R&amp;T) is an American automotive enthusiast magazine first published 1947. It is owned by Hearst Magazines and is published six times per year. The editorial offices are located in New York, New York.

==History==

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;R&amp;T&quot;) was founded by two friends, Wilfred H. Brehaut, Jr. and Joseph S. Fennessy, in 1947, in Hempstead, New York. Published only six times from 1947 to 1949, it struggled in its early years. By 1952, regular contributor and editor John R. Bond and his wife Elaine had become the owners of the magazine, which then grew until its sale to CBS Publications in 1972.

The ampersand (&amp;) in the title was introduced in 1955 by then Editor Terry Galanoy, who replaced the word &quot;and&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s name because the words Road and Track were graphically too long for newsstand-effective recognition.

In 1988, Hachette Filipacchi Media took ownership of the magazine. In October 2008, Matt DeLorenzo became editor-in-chief, succeeding Thos L. Bryant, who had been in place for 20 years. Hearst Magazines purchased the magazine in 2011. In June 2012, Larry Webster assumed the role of editor-in-chief, and DeLorenzo became an adviser to the publication. Additionally, the magazine moved its operations from Newport Beach, California, to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In February 2016, Webster resigned as editor-in-chief and Kim Wolfkill was announced as his replacement. In the March/April 2019 issue, Wolfkill announced that the editorial offices in Michigan were closing, and that publication was moving to New York, New York, at the Hearst Tower. His LinkedIn profile lists February 2019 as his final date at &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. Travis Okulski, &quot;Road &amp; Track&#x27;s&quot; website director at the time, took on the editor-in-chief role from the May 2019 issue onwards.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; and &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; are sister publications at Hearst and share the same advertising, sales, marketing, and circulation departments. However, their editorial operations are distinct and they have separate publishers. This arrangement exists since 1985, when CBS acquired Ziff Davis&#x27; consumer magazines and among them, &quot;Car and Driver&quot;.

In August 2020, the magazine transitioned to a large-format bi-monthly that emphasized elegant design and deeply-reported features. Incoming Editor-in-Chief Mike Guy, who had previously launched &quot;The Drive&quot; for Time Inc., hired Executive Editor Daniel Pund and Creative Director Nathan Schroeder, and together they refashioned &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; as the premium, 180-page enthusiast magazine on stands today. The Smoking Tire&#x27;s Matt Farah and best-selling author A.J. Baime (&quot;Go Like Hell&quot;, &quot;The Accidental President&quot;) joined as Editors-at-Large.

In January 2024, former Executive Editor Dan Pund was confirmed as Road &amp; Track&#x27;s new Editor-in-Chief.

==Content==
&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; focuses on new production cars, vintage cars, and race cars with drive reviews, road trips, and comparison tests. Former race car drivers have often contributed material, including Paul Frère, Sam Posey, and Formula One champion Phil Hill. Other notable contributors include McLaren F1 designer Gordon Murray, car executive Bob Lutz, Henry N. Manney III, Peter Egan, Jason Cammisa, and Matt Farah.

Like many auto magazines, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; currently publishes an annual &quot;car of the year&quot; test, dubbed the Road &amp; Track Performance Car of the Year. The test&#x27;s most recent winner is the 2020 Hyundai Veloster N.

==Video games==
&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; contributed to the 1992 video game, &quot;Grand Prix Unlimited&quot;, developed by Accolade for MS-DOS. The magazine also contributed to the 1994 video game, &quot;The Need for Speed&quot;, to help the designers match vehicle behavior and sounds to that of the real cars.
