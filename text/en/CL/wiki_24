<text>Bad Kreuznach () is a town in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is a spa town, most well known for its medieval bridge dating from around 1300, the Alte Nahebrücke, which is one of the few remaining bridges in the world with buildings on it.

The town is located in the Nahe River wine region, renowned both nationally and internationally for its wines, especially from the Riesling, Silvaner and Müller-Thurgau grape varieties.

Bad Kreuznach does not lie within any , even though it is the seat of the Bad Kreuznach (Verbandsgemeinde). The town is the seat of several courts, as well as federal and state authorities. Bad Kreuznach is also officially a &quot;große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (&quot;large town belonging to a district&quot;), meaning that it does not have the district-level powers that &quot;kreisfreie Städte&quot; (&quot;district-free towns/cities&quot;) enjoy. It is, nonetheless, the district seat, and also the seat of the state chamber of commerce for Rhineland-Palatinate. It is classed as a middle centre with some functions of an upper centre, making it the administrative, cultural and economic hub of a region with more than 150,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==

===Location===
Bad Kreuznach lies between the Hunsrück, Rhenish Hesse and the North Palatine Uplands, some as the crow flies south-southwest of Bingen am Rhein. It lies at the mouth of the Ellerbach, where it empties into the lower Nahe.
===Neighbouring municipalities===
Clockwise from the north, Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s neighbours are the municipalities of Bretzenheim, Langenlonsheim, Gensingen, Welgesheim, Zotzenheim, Sprendlingen, Badenheim (these last five lying in the neighbouring Mainz-Bingen district), Biebelsheim, Pfaffen-Schwabenheim, Volxheim, Hackenheim, Frei-Laubersheim, Altenbamberg, Traisen, Hüffelsheim, Rüdesheim an der Nahe, Roxheim, Hargesheim and Guldental.

===Constituent communities===
Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s outlying &quot;Ortsbezirke&quot; or &quot;Stadtteile&quot; are Bosenheim, Ippesheim, Planig, Winzenheim and Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg.

===Climate===

Yearly precipitation in Bad Kreuznach amounts to 517 mm, which is very low, falling into the lowest third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 5% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations are even lower figures recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is 1.8 times what it is in January. Precipitation varies only slightly. At only 7% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.

==History==

===Antiquity===
As early as the 5th century BC, there is conclusive evidence that there was a Celtic settlement within what are now Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s town limits. About 58 BC, the area became part of the Roman Empire and a Roman vicus came into being here, named, according to legend, after a Celt called Cruciniac, who transferred a part of his land to the Romans for them to build a supply station between Mainz (Mogontiacum) and Trier (Augusta Treverorum). Kreuznach lay on the Roman road that led from Metz (Divodurum), by way of the Saar crossing near Dillingen-Pachten (Contiomagus) and the Vicus Wareswald, near Tholey to Bingen am Rhein (Bingium). About AD 250, an enormous (measuring 81 × 71 m), luxurious palace, unique to the lands north of the Alps, was built, in the style of a peristyle villa. It contained 50 rooms on the ground floor alone. Spolia found near the &quot;Heidenmauer&quot; (&quot;Heathen Wall&quot;) have led to the conclusion that there were a temple to either Mercury or both Mercury and Maia and a Gallo-Roman provincial theatre. According to an inscription and tile plates that were found in Bad Kreuznach, a vexillatio of the Legio XXII Primigenia was stationed there. In the course of measures to shore up the Imperial border against the Germanic Alemannic tribes who kept making incursions across the limes into the Empire, an auxiliary castrum was built in 370 under Emperor Valentinian I.

===Middle Ages===

After Rome&#x27;s downfall, Kreuznach became in the year 500 a royal estate and an imperial village in the newly growing Frankish Empire. Then, the town&#x27;s first church was built within the old castrum&#x27;s walls, which was at first consecrated to Saint Martin, but later to Saint Kilian, and in 1590, it was torn down. According to an 822 document from Louis the Pious, who was invoking an earlier document from Charlemagne, about 741, Saint Martin&#x27;s Church in Kreuznach was supposedly donated to the Bishopric of Würzburg by his forebear Carloman. According to this indirect note, Kreuznach once again had a documentary mention in the &quot;Annales regni Francorum&quot; as Royal &quot;Pfalz&quot; (an imperial palace), where Louis the Pious stayed in 819 and 839. Kreuznach was mentioned in documents by Louis the Pious (in 823 as &quot;villa Cruciniacus&quot; and in 825 and 839, as &quot;Cruciniacum castrum&quot; or &quot;Cruciniacum palatium regium&quot;), Louis the German (in 845 as &quot;villa Cruzinacha&quot; and in 868 as &quot;villa Cruciniacum&quot;), Charles III, &quot;the Fat&quot; (in 882 as &quot;C[h]rucinachum&quot;, &quot;Crutcinacha&quot;, &quot;Crucenachum&quot;), Arnulf of Carinthia (in 889), Henry the Fowler (in 923), Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor (in 962 as &quot;Cruciniacus&quot;) and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor (in 1179 as &quot;Cruczennach&quot;). On the other hand, the &quot;Crucinaha&quot; in Emperor Otto III&#x27;s documents from 1000 (which granted the rights to hold a yearly market and to strike coins) is today thought to refer to Christnach, an outlying centre of Waldbillig, a town nowadays in Luxembourg. In mediaeval and early modern Latin sources, Kreuznach is named not only as &quot;Crucenacum&quot;, &quot;Crucin[i]acum&quot; (adjective &quot;Crucenacensis&quot;, &quot;Crucin[i]acensis&quot;) and the like, but also as &quot;Stauronesus, Stauronesum&quot; (adjective &quot;Staurone[n]s[i]us&quot;; from σταυρός &quot;cross&quot; and νῆσος &quot;island&quot;) or &quot;Naviculacrucis&quot; (from &quot;navicula&quot;, a kind of small boat used on inland waterways, called a &quot;Nachen&quot; in German, and &quot;crux&quot; &quot;cross&quot;). Sometimes also encountered is the abbreviation &quot;Xnach&quot; (often with a Fraktur X, with a cross-stroke: formula_1). About 1017, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor enfeoffed his wife Cunigunde&#x27;s grandnephew, Count Eberhard V of Nellenburg, with the noble estate of Kreuznach and the Villa Schwabenheim belonging thereto. After his death, King Henry IV supposedly donated the settlement of Kreuznach to the High Foundation of Speyer in 1065, who then transferred it shortly after 1105 – presumably as a fief – to the Counts of Sponheim. On Epiphany 1147, it is said that Bernard of Clairvaux performed a miraculous healing at Saint Kilian&#x27;s Church. In 1183, half of the old Frankish village of Kreuznach at the former Roman castrum – the &quot;Osterburg&quot; – burnt down. Afterwards, of the 21 families there, 11 moved to what is now the Old Town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;). In the years 1206 to 1230, Counts Gottfried III of Sponheim (d. 1218) and Johann I of Sponheim (d. 1266) had the castle Kauzenburg built, even though King Philip of Swabia had forbidden them to do so. Along with the building of this castle came the rise of the New Town (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) on the Nahe&#x27;s north bank. In the years 1235 and 1270, Kreuznach was granted town rights, market rights, taxation rights and tolling rights under the rule of the comital House of Sponheim, which were acknowledged once again in 1290 by King Rudolf I of Habsburg. In 1279, in the Battle of Sprendlingen, the legend of Michel Mort arose. He is a local legendary hero, a butcher from Kreuznach who fought on the Sponheim side in the battle against the troops of the Archbishop of Mainz. When Count Johann I of Sponheim found himself in difficulties, Michel Mort drew the enemy&#x27;s lances upon himself, sparing the Count by bringing about his own death. Early knowledge of the town of Kreuznach is documented in one line of a song by the minstrel Tannhäuser from the 13th century, which is preserved in handwriting by Hans Sachs: &quot;vur creűczenach rint aűch die na&quot;. In Modern German, this would be &quot;Vor Kreuznach rinnt auch die Nahe&quot; (&quot;Before Kreuznach, the Nahe also runs&quot;). Records witness Jewish settlement in Kreuznach beginning in the late 13th century, while for a short time in the early 14th century, North Italian traders (&quot;Lombards&quot;) lived in town. In the 13th century, Kreuznach was a fortified town and in 1320, it withstood a siege by Archbishop-Elector Baldwin of Trier (about 1270–1336). In 1361, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor granted Count Walram I of Sponheim (about 1305–1380) a yearly market privilege for Kreuznach. In 1375, the townsfolk rose up against the town council. Count Walram&#x27;s response was to have four of the uprising&#x27;s leaders beheaded at the marketplace. Through its long time as Kreuznach&#x27;s lordly family, the House of Sponheim had seven heads:
* Simon I (1223–1264)
* John I (1265–1290)
* John II (1290–1340) and Simon II (1290–1336)
* Walram (1336–1380)
* Simon III (1380–1414)
* Elisabeth (1414–1417)
In 1417, however, the &quot;Further&quot; line of the House of Sponheim died out when Countess Elisabeth of Sponheim-Kreuznach (1365–1417) died. In her will, she divided the county between Electoral Palatinate and the County of Sponheim-Starkenburg, bequeathing to them one fifth and four-fifths respectively. In 1418, King Sigismund of Luxembourg enfeoffed Count Johann V of Sponheim-Starkenburg (about 1359–1437) with the yearly market, the mint, the Jews at Kreuznach and the right of escort, as far as Gensingen on the Trier-Mainz highway. In 1437, the lordship over Kreuznach was divided up between the Counts of Veldenz, the Margraves of Baden and Palatinate-Simmern. In 1457, at a time when a children&#x27;s crusade movement was on the rise, 120 children left Kreuznach on their way to Mont-Saint-Michel by way of Wissembourg. In 1475, Electoral Palatinate issued a comprehensive police act for the &quot;Amt&quot; of Kreuznach, in which at this time, no Badish &quot;Amtmann&quot; resided. Elector Palatine Philip the Upright and John I, Count Palatine of Simmern granted the town leave to hold a second yearly market in 1490. In that same year, Elector Palatine Philip bestowed ownership of the &quot;saltz- und badbronnen&quot; (&quot;salty and bathing springs&quot;) upon his cooks Conrad Brunn and Matthes von Nevendorf. The briny springs were likely discovered in 1478; nevertheless, a &quot;Sulzer Hof&quot; in what is today called the Salinental (&quot;Saltworks Dale&quot;) had already been mentioned in the 13th or 14th century. On 24 August 1495, there was another uprising of the townsfolk, but this one was directed at Kreuznach&#x27;s Palatine &quot;Amtmann&quot;, Albrecht V Göler von Ravensburg, who had refused to release a prisoner against the posting of a bond. Nobody was beheaded this time, but Elector Palatine Philip did have a few of the leaders maimed, and then put into force a new town order.

====Town fortifications====
The town wall, first mentioned in 1247, had a footprint that formed roughly a square in the Old Town, and was set back a few metres from what are today the streets Wilhelmstraße, Salinenstraße and Schloßstraße, with the fourth side skirting the millpond. Serving as town gates were, in the north, the &quot;Kilianstor&quot; or the &quot;Mühlentor&quot; (&quot;Saint Kilian&#x27;s Gate&quot; or &quot;Mill Gate&quot;; torn down in 1877), in the southeast the &quot;Hackenheimer Tor&quot; (later the &quot;Mannheimer Tor&quot;; torn down in 1860) and in the south the &quot;St.-Peter-Pförtchen&quot;, which lay at the end of Rossstraße, and which for security was often walled up. In the New Town, the town wall ran from the &quot;Butterfass&quot; (&quot;Butterchurn&quot;; later serving as the prison tower) on the Nahe riverbank up to the intersection of Wilhelmstraße and Brückes on &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 48, where to the northwest the &quot;Löhrpforte&quot; (also called the &quot;Lehrtor&quot; or the &quot;Binger Tor&quot;; torn down about 1837) was found. It then ran in a bow between Hofgartenstraße and Hochstraße to the &quot;Rüdesheimer Tor&quot; in the southwest at the beginning of Gerbergasse, whose course it then followed down to the Ellerbach and along the Nahe as a riverbank wall. Along this section, the town wall contained the &quot;Fischerpforte&quot; or &quot;Ellerpforte&quot; as a watergate and in the south, the &quot;Große Pforte&quot; (&quot;Great Gate&quot;) at the bridge across the Nahe. Belonging to the fortified complex of the Kauzenburg, across the Ellerbach from the New Town, were the &quot;Klappertor&quot; and a narrow, defensive ward (&quot;zwinger&quot;), from which the street known as &quot;Zwingel&quot; gets its name. On the bridge over to the ait (or the &quot;Wörth&quot; as it is called locally; the river island between the two parts of town) stood the &quot;Brückentor&quot; (&quot;Bridge Gate&quot;). To defend the town there was, besides the castle&#x27;s Burgmannen, also a kind of townsmen&#x27;s defence force or shooting guild (somewhat like a town militia). Preserved as an incunable print from 1487, printed in Mainz by Peter Schöffer (about 1425–1503), is an invitation from the mayor and town council to any and all who considered themselves good marksmen with the crossbow to come to a shooting contest on 23 September.

====Jewish population====
On 31 March 1283 (2 Nisan 5043) in Kreuznach (קרויצנאך), Rabbi Ephraim bar Elieser ha-Levi – apparently as a result of a judicial sentence – was broken on the wheel. The execution was likely linked to the Mainz blood libel accusations, which in March and April 1283 also led to pogroms in Mellrichstadt, Mainz, Bacharach and Rockenhausen.

In 1311, Aaron Judeus de Crucenaco (the last three words mean &quot;the Jew from Kreuznach&quot;) was mentioned, as was a Jewish toll gatherer from Bingen am Rhein named Abraham von Kreuznach in 1328, 1342 and 1343. In 1336, Emperor Louis the Bavarian allowed Count Johann II of Sponheim-Kreuznach to permanently keep 60 house-owning freed Jews at Kreuznach or elsewhere on his lands (&quot;… daß er zu Creützenach oder anderstwoh in seinen landen 60 haußgesäsß gefreyter juden ewiglich halten möge …&quot;). After further persecution in the time of the Plague in 1348/1349, there is no further evidence of Jews in Kreuznach until 1375. By 1382 at the latest, the Jew Gottschalk (who died sometime between 1409 and 1421) from Katzenelnbogen was living in Kreuznach and owned the house at the corner of Lämmergasse and Mannheimerstraße 12 (later: Löwensteiner Hof) near the &quot;Eiermarkt&quot; (&quot;Egg Market&quot;). On a false charge of usury, Count Simon III of Sponheim (after 1330–1414) had him thrown in prison and only released him after payment of a hefty ransom. He was afterwards taken into protection by Ruprecht III of the Palatinate against a yearly payment of 10 Rhenish guilders. At Gottschalk&#x27;s suggestion, Archbishop Johann of Nassau-Wiesbaden-Idstein lifted the &quot;dice toll&quot; for Jews crossing the border into the Archbishopric of Mainz. The special taxes for Jews ordered in 1418 and 1434 by King Sigismund of Luxembourg were also imposed in Kreuznach.

In the Middle Ages, the eastern part of today&#x27;s Poststraße in the New Town was the &quot;Judengasse&quot; (&quot;Jews&#x27; Lane&quot;). The &quot;Kleine Judengasse&quot; ran from the &quot;Judengasse&quot; to what is today called Magister-Faust-Gasse. In 1482, a &quot;Jewish school&quot; was mentioned, which might already have stood at Fährgasse 2 (lane formerly known as &quot;Kleine Eselsgass&quot; – &quot;Little Ass&#x27;s Lane&quot;), where the Old Synagogue of Bad Kreuznach later stood (first mentioned here in 1715; new Baroque building in 1737; renovated in 1844; destroyed in 1938; torn down in 1953/1954; last wall remnant removed in 1975). In 1525, Louis V, Elector Palatine allowed Meïr Levi to settle for, at first, twelve years in Kreuznach, to organise the money market there, to receive visits, to lay out his own burial plot and to deal in medicines. In the earlier half of the 16th century, his son, the physician Isaak Levi, whose collection of medical works became well known as &quot;Des Juden buch von kreuczenach&quot; (&quot;The Jew&#x27;s Book of/from Kreuznach&quot;), lived in Kreuznach. The work is preserved in a manuscript transcribed personally by Louis V, Elector Palatine. The oldest Jewish graveyard in Kreuznach lay in the area of today&#x27;s &quot;Rittergut Bangert&quot; (knightly estate), having been mentioned in 1525 and 1636. The Jewish graveyard on Stromberger Straße was bought in 1661 (one preserved gravestone, however, dates from 1630) and expanded in 1919. It is said to be one of the best preserved in Rhineland-Palatinate. The Jewish family Creizenach, originally from Kreuznach, is known from records to have been in Mainz and Frankfurt am Main from 1733, and to have produced a number of important academics (Michael Creizenach, Theodor Creizenach, and Wilhelm Creizenach). The Yiddish name for Kreuznach was צלם־מקום (abbreviated צ״מ), variously rendered in Latin script as &quot;Zelem-Mochum&quot; or &quot;Celemochum&quot; (with the initial Z or C intended to transliterate the letter &quot;צ&quot;, as they would be pronounced /ts/ in German), which literally meant &quot;Image Place&quot;, for pious Jews wished to avoid the term &quot;Kreuz&quot; (&quot;cross&quot;). In 1828, 425 of the 7,896 inhabitants of the &quot;Bürgermeisterei&quot; (&quot;Mayoralty&quot;) of Kreuznach (5.4%) adhered to the Jewish faith, as did 611 of the town&#x27;s 18,143 inhabitants (3.4%) in 1890.

====Monasteries====
Before the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Kreuznach had some 8,000 inhabitants and seven monasteries. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, the following monasteries were mentioned:
* Saint Mary&#x27;s Monastery (St. Marien-Kloster; monastery&#x27;s nature legendary) or Saint Mary&#x27;s Church (&quot;St. Marien-Kirche&quot;) on the ait, supposedly endowed by King Dagobert I (d. 639) on the site where Paul&#x27;s Protestant Church (&quot;Pauluskirche&quot;) now stands.
* Saint Kilian&#x27;s Monastery (&quot;Kloster St. Kilian&quot;; old parish church; monastery&#x27;s nature unclear), in the &quot;Osterburg&quot; (old Roman castrum, Charlemagne&#x27;s palace) on the &quot;Heidenmauer&quot; (&quot;Heathen Wall&quot;) built on the site of the Constantinian Saint Martin&#x27;s Church (&quot;St. Martins-Kirche&quot;), first mentioned about 741 and destroyed by the Normans about 891, tied with a hospital in 1310; in the 14th century there was a Beguine cell with prayer house; the monastery was torn down about 1590. The patrocinia of Saint Martin and Saint Kilian were then added to Saint Mary&#x27;s Church on the ait.
* Augustinian convent of Saint Peter, endowed by Rhinegrave Wolfram I (III) of Stein (d. about 1179) about 1140, incorporated into the Schwabenheim Augustinian monastery in 1437, moved to the so-called &quot;Bubenkapelle&quot; (&quot;Lads&#x27; Chapel&quot;) in 1491, reoccupied in 1495, dissolved in 1566/1568; the 15 nuns who were driven out went to Eibingen Abbey. In 1624, an attempt to reoccupy the complex by Augustinian monks failed; Jesuits settled there in 1636 and in 1648 they were granted it by agreement, today &quot;Oranienhof&quot;. The Pietà from Saint Peter, for whose reverence a forty-day indulgence was secured from Pope Alexander VI in 1502, was kept until its destruction in 1942 at St. Quintin&#x27;s Church, Mainz.
* Carmelite Monastery to Saint Nicholas, so-called &quot;Schwarz-Kloster&quot; (&quot;Black Monastery&quot;), endowed in 1281 by the comital House of Sponheim, confirmed in 1290 by Archbishop Gerhard II of Eppstein of Mainz (about 1230–1305), dissolved in 1802.
* Saint Anthony&#x27;s and Saint Catherine&#x27;s Chapel (&quot;St. Antonius-und-St.-Katharinen-Kapelle&quot;; also called the &quot;Bubenkapelle&quot;) on the way into Mühlengasse (&quot;Mill Lane&quot;), which belonged to the Schwabenheim Augustinian monastery; it was here, right inside the town, that Count Walram of Sponheim (about 1305–1380) moved the Beguine cell from Saint Kilian&#x27;s, given up in 1437; reoccupied by Augustinian nuns from 1491 to 1495, then moved to Saint Peter&#x27;s.
* Saint Wolfgang&#x27;s Franciscan Monastery (&quot;Franziskanerkloster St. Wolfgang&quot;), endowed in 1472 by Frederick I, Elector Palatine and Count Palatine Frederick I of Simmern, confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV, dissolved in 1802, now the &quot;Gymnasium an der Stadtmauer&quot; (&quot;Gymnasium on the Town Wall&quot;).
* Saint Vincent&#x27;s Monastery, location unclear, existed in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and later.
* Jesuit occupation about 1623, 1625 to 1632 and 1636 to 1652 in the quire of the Ait Church (&quot;Wörthkirche&quot;), later called the Bridge Church (&quot;Brückenkirche&quot;) and now Paul&#x27;s Church (&quot;Pauluskirche&quot;), received in 1631 from Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor Saint Peter&#x27;s and took ownership in 1636. In Kreuznach, the study prefect Johann Engelbert Oliverius worked and died.

====Plague and leprosy====
The Plague threatened Kreuznach several times throughout its history. Great epidemics are recorded as having broken out in 1348/1349 (Johannes Trithemius spoke of 1,600 victims), 1364, 1501/1502, 1608, 1635 (beginning in September) and 1666 (reportedly 1,300 victims). During the 1501 epidemic, the humanist and Palatine prince-raiser Adam Werner von Themar, one of Abbot Trithemius&#x27;s friends, wrote a poem in Kreuznach about the plague saint, Sebastian. Outside the town, a sickhouse for lepers, the so-called &quot;Gutleuthof&quot;, was founded on the Gräfenbach down from the village of Hargesheim and had its first documentary mention in 1487.

===Modern times===
In the War of the Succession of Landshut against Elector Palatine Philip of the Rhine, both the town and the castle were unsuccessfully besieged for six days by Alexander, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken and William I, Landgrave of Lower Hesse, who then laid the surrounding countryside waste. The Sponheim abbot Johannes Trithemius had brought the monasterial belongings, the library and the archive to safety in Kreuznach. The besieged town was relieved by Electoral Palatinate Captain Hans III, &quot;Landschad&quot; of Steinach. In 1507, Master Faust assumed the rector&#x27;s post at the Kreuznach Latin school, which had been secured for him by Franz von Sickingen. On the grounds of allegations of fornication, he fled the town only a short time afterwards, as witnessed by a letter from Johannes Trithemius to Johannes Virdung, in which Virdung was warned about Faust. Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, who spent Whitsun 1508 in Boppard, stayed in Kreuznach in June 1508 and wrote from there to his daughter Duchess Margaret of Savoy. In 1557, the Reformation was introduced into Kreuznach. According to the 1601 &quot;Verzeichnis aller Herrlich- und Gerechtigkeiten der Stätt und Dörffer der vorderen Grafschaft Sponheim im Ampt Creutznach&quot; (&quot;Directory of All Lordships and Justices of the Towns and Villages of the Further County of Sponheim in the &quot;Amt&quot; of Kreuznach&quot;), compiled by Electoral Palatinate &quot;Oberamtmann&quot; Johann von Eltz-Blieskastel-Wecklingen, the town had 807 estates and was the seat of a &quot;Hofgericht&quot; (lordly court) to which the &quot;free villages&quot; of Waldböckelheim, Wöllstein, Volxheim, Braunweiler, Mandel and Roxheim, which were thus freed from the toll at Kreuznach, had to send &quot;Schöffen&quot; (roughly &quot;lay jurists&quot;).

====Thirty Years&#x27; War====
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Kreuznach was overrun and captured many times by various factions fighting in that war:
* - In the Siege of Bad Kreuznach the town was taken by the Imperial-Spanish troops of General Marquis Ambrogio Spinola under Wilhelm Ferdinand von Effern. In 1621 Countess Catharina Belgica of Nassau travelled to Kreuznach to see Spinola to ask him to the spare the County of Hanau-Münzenberg. The Governors General of the Lower Palatinate, based in Kreuznach, were Don Guillermo de Verdugo di Fauleria, Baron von Böhmisch-Mascha und Tuppau, Don Felipe de Sylva (d. 1644) and Louis de la Tour.

* - Kreuznach was taken by Swedish, Saxe-Weimar and English troops under King Gustav II Adolf; the castle capitulated on ). William Craven and Sir Francis Fane of Fulbeck (about 1611–1681?) were both seriously wounded at the conquest of the castle. Serving as commanders were the Scots Colonel Alexander Ramsay (d. 1634) and Lieutenant Colonel (later General and Field Marshal) Robert Douglas. Julius Wilhelm Zincgref was installed in 1632 as the Kreuznach state scrivener by the allied Ludwig Philipp of Palatinate-Simmern.
* 14 July 1635 - Imperial troops briefly thrust their way into Kreuznach, but were repulsed by the occupation at the castle.
* - Saxe-Weimar and French troops under Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar and Louis de Nogaret Cardinal de La Valette, together with the Swedes passed through Kreuznach, later passing through once again on as they retreated. Kreuznach&#x27;s last &quot;Swedish&quot; commander was Colonel Johann Georg Stauff from Dirmstein.
* 20 December 1635 - Kreuznach was taken by Imperial-Spanish and Imperial-Croatian troops under General Matthias Gallas. The castle was still held by the Swedes until May 1636 under an armistice upon which both Colonel Stauff and Badish Lieutenant Colonel Bernhard Studnitzky von Beneschau (Studnický z Benešova) agreed on . Stationed in the town were regiments headed by William, Margrave of Baden-Baden. As neutral ground, Kreuznach was placed under joint Badish and Palatinate-Simmern rule.
* - Kreuznach was taken by French and Saxe-Weimar troops under Duke Henri II d’Orléans, Duke of Longueville, after town commander Braun von Schmidtburg zu Schweich had gone over to them.
* - Bad Kreuznach was captured by Imperial-Bavarian and Imperial-Spanish troops under the &quot;Schillerhaas&quot;, &quot;Generalfeldwachtmeister&quot; Gilles de Haes began. An earlier attack in March 1641 had been defeated. The town capitulated on , while the fortress held out until .
* - Kreuznach was taken by French troops under Marshal of France Henri de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne (the castle was held by the Bavarians until ) and transferred by &quot;Maréchal de camp&quot; Guy de Bar to Palatinate-Simmern.
The town was thus heavily drawn into hardship and woe, and the population dwindled from some 8,000 at the war&#x27;s outbreak to roughly 3,500. The expression &quot;Er ist zu Kreuznach geboren&quot; (&quot;He was born at Kreuznach&quot;) became a byword in German for somebody who had to struggle with a great deal of hardship. On 19 August 1663, the town was stricken by an extraordinarily high flood on the river Nahe.

====Nine Years&#x27; War====
In the Nine Years&#x27; War (known in Germany as the &quot;Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg&quot;, or War of the Palatine Succession), the Kauzenburg (castle) was conquered on 5 October 1688 by Marshal Louis François, duc de Boufflers. The town fortifications and the castle were torn down and the town of Kreuznach largely destroyed in May 1689 by French troops under Brigadier Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac (about 1630–1704) or Lieutenant General Marquis Nicolas du Blé d’Uxelles. On 18 October 1689, Kreuznach&#x27;s churches were burnt down.

====18th century====

As of 1708, Kreuznach wholly belonged to Electoral Palatinate. Under Elector Palatine Karl III Philipp, the Karlshalle Saltworks were built in 1729. Built in 1743 by Prince-Elector, Count Palatine and Duke Karl Theodor were the Theodorshalle Saltworks. On 13 May 1725, after a cloudburst and hailstorm, Kreuznach was stricken by an extreme flood in which 31 people lost their lives, some 300 or 400 head of cattle drowned, two houses were utterly destroyed and many damaged and remaining parts of the town wall fell in. Taking part at the founding of the Masonic Lodge &quot;Zum wiedererbauten Tempel der Bruderliebe&quot; (&quot;To the Rebuilt Temple of Brotherly Love&quot;) in Worms in 1781 were also Freemasons from Kreuznach. As early as 1775, the Grand Lodge of the Rhenish Masonic Lodges (8th Provincial Grand Lodge) of Strict Observance had already been given the name &quot;Kreuznach&quot;. In the extreme winter of 1783/1784, the town was heavily damaged on 27–28 February 1784 by an icerun and flooding. A pharmacist named Daniel Riem was killed in his house &quot;Zum weißen Schwan&quot; (&quot;At the White Swan&quot;) when it collapsed into the floodwaters.

====French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times====

In the course of the Napoleonic Wars (1792–1814), French emigrants came to Kreuznach, among them Prince Louis Joseph of Condé. In October 1792, French Revolutionary troops under General Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine occupied the land around Kreuznach, remaining there until 28 March 1793. The town itself was briefly occupied by French troops under General François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers on 4 January and then again on 16 October 1794. From 30 October until 1 December 1795, the town was held by Imperial troops under Rhinegrave Karl August von Salm-Grumbach, but they were at first driven out in bloody battles by Marshals Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. In this time, the town suffered greatly under sackings and involuntary contributions. After the French withdrew on 12 December, it was occupied by an Austrian battalion under Captain Alois Graf Gavasini, which withdrew again on 30 May 1796. On 9 June 1796, Kreuznach was once again occupied by the French. In 1797, Kreuznach, along with all lands on the Rhine&#x27;s left bank, was annexed by the French First Republic, a deed confirmed under international law by the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville. The parts of town that lay north of the Nahe were assigned to the Arrondissement of Simmern in the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle, whereas those that lay to the south were assigned to the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). The subprefect in Simmern in 1800 was Andreas van Recum and in 1806 it was Ludwig von Closen. The &quot;maire&quot; of Kreuznach as of 1800 was Franz Joseph Potthoff (b. 1756; d. after 1806) and beginning in 1806 it was Karl Joseph Burret. On 20 September and 5 October 1804, the French Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte visited Kreuznach. On the occasion of Napoleon&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Austerlitz a celebratory Te Deum was held at the Catholic churches in January 1806 on Bishop of Aachen Marc-Antoine Berdolet&#x27;s orders (Kreuznach was part of his diocese from 1801 to 1821). In 1808, Napoleon made a gift of Kreuznach&#x27;s two saltworks to his favourite sister, Pauline. In 1809, the Kreuznach Masonic Lodge &quot;Les amis réunis de la Nahe et du Rhin&quot; was founded by van Reccum, which at first lasted only until 1814. It was, however, refounded in 1858. In Napoleon&#x27;s honour, the timing of the Kreuznach yearly market was set by Mayor Burret on the Sunday after his birthday (15 August). Men from Kreuznach also took part in Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 Russian Campaign on the French side, to whom a monument established at the Mannheimer Straße graveyard in 1842 still stands. The subsequent German campaign (called the &quot;Befreiungskriege&quot;, or Wars of Liberation, in Germany) put an end to French rule.

====Congress of Vienna to First World War====

Until a permanent new order could be imposed under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, the region lay under joint Bavarian-Austrian administration, whose seat was in Kreuznach. When these terms eventually came about, Kreuznach passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and from 1816 it belonged to the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Koblenz in the province of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (as of 1822 the Rhine Province) and was a border town with two neighbouring states, the Grand Duchy of Hesse to the east and the Bavarian exclave of the Palatinate to the south. The two saltworks, which had now apparently been taken away from Napoleon&#x27;s sister, were from 1816 to 1897 Grand-Ducal-Hessian state property on Prussian territory. In 1817, Johann Erhard Prieger opened the first bathing parlour with briny water and thereby laid the groundwork for the fast-growing spa business. In 1843, Karl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen in Kreuznach, presumably at the &quot;Wilhelmskirche&quot; (William&#x27;s Church), which had been built between 1698 and 1700 and was later, in 1968, all but torn down, leaving only the churchtower. In Kreuznach, Marx set down considerable portions of his manuscript &quot;Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot; (&quot;Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie&quot;) in 1843. Clara Schumann, who was attending the spa in Kreuznach, and her half-sister Marie Wieck gave a concert at the spa house in 1860. With the building of the Nahe Valley Railway from Bingerbrück to Saarbrücken in 1858/1860, the groundwork was laid for the town&#x27;s industrialisation. This, along with the ever-growing income from the spa, led after years of stagnation to an economic boost for the town&#x27;s development. Nevertheless, the railway was not built for industry and spa-goers alone, but also as a logistical supply line for a war that was expected to break out with France. Before this, though, right at Kreuznach&#x27;s town limits, Prussia and Bavaria once again stood at odds with each other in 1866. Thinking that was not influenced by this led to another railway line being built even before the First World War, the &quot;strategic railway&quot; from Bad Münster by way of Staudernheim, Meisenheim, Lauterecken and Kusel towards the west, making Kreuznach into an important contributor to transport towards the west. Only about 1950 were parts of this line torn up and abandoned. Today, between Staudernheim and Kusel, it serves as a tourist attraction for those who wish to ride draisines.

In 1891, three members of the Franciscan Brothers of the Holy Cross came to live in Kreuznach. In 1893, they took over the hospital &quot;Kiskys-Wörth&quot;, which as of 1905 bore the name &quot;St. Marienwörth&quot;. Since 1948, they have run it together with the Sisters of the Congregation of Papal Law of the Maids of Mary of the Immaculate Conception, and today run it as a hospital bearing the classification &quot;II. Regelversorgung&quot; under Germany&#x27;s &quot;Versorgungsstufe&quot; hospital planning system. In 1901, the Second Rhenish &quot;Diakonissen-Mutterhaus&quot; (&quot;Deaconess&#x27;s Mother-House&quot;), founded in 1889 in Sobernheim, moved under its abbot, the Reverend Hugo Reich, to Kreuznach. It is now a foundation known as the &quot;kreuznacher diakonie&quot; (always written with lowercase initials). In 1904, the pharmacist Karl Aschoff discovered the Kreuznach brine&#x27;s radon content, and thereafter introduced &quot;radon balneology&quot;, a therapy that had already been practised in the Austro-Hungarian town of Sankt Joachimsthal in the Bohemian Ore Mountains (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic). Even though the Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s radon content was much slighter than that found in the waters from Brambach or Bad Gastein, the town was quickly billed as a &quot;radium healing spa&quot; – the technical error in that billing notwithstanding. In 1912, a radon inhalatorium was brought into service, into which was piped the air from an old mining gallery at the Kauzenberg, which had a higher radon content than the springwater. The inhalatorium was destroyed in 1945. In 1974, however, the old mining gallery itself was converted into a therapy room. To this day, radon inhalation serves as a natural pain reliever for those suffering from rheumatism. In the First World War, both the Kreuznach spa house and other hotels and villas became as of 2 January 1917 the seat of the Great Headquarters of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser actually lived in the spa house. Used as the General staff building was the Oranienhof. At the spa house on 19 December 1917, General Mustafa Kemal Pasha – better known as Atatürk (&quot;Father of the Turks&quot;) and later president of a strictly secular Turkey – the Kaiser, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff all met for talks. Only an extreme wintertime flood on the Nahe in January 1918 led to the Oberste Heeresleitung being moved to Spa in Belgium.

====Weimar Republic and Third Reich====
After the First World War, French troops occupied the Rhineland and along with it, Kreuznach, whose great hotels were thereafter mostly abandoned. In 1924, Kreuznach was granted the designation &quot;Bad&quot;, literally &quot;Bath&quot;, which is conferred on places that can be regarded as health resorts. Since this time, the town has been known as Bad Kreuznach. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in 1933, some, among them the trade unionist Hugo Salzmann, organised resistance to National Socialism. Despite imprisonment, Salzmann survived the Third Reich, and after 1945 sat on town council for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The Jews who were still left in the district after the Second World War broke out were on the district leadership&#x27;s orders taken in 1942 to the former &quot;Kolpinghaus&quot;, whence, on 27 July, they were deported to Theresienstadt. Bad Kreuznach, whose spa facilities and remaining hotels once again, from 1939 to 1940, became the seat of the Army High Command, was time and again targeted by Allied air raids because of the Wehrmacht barracks on Bosenheimer Straße, Alzeyer Straße and Franziska-Puricelli-Straße as well as the strategically important Berlin-Paris railway line, which then led through the town. The last &quot;Stadtkommandant&quot; (town commander), Lieutenant Colonel Johann Kaup (d. 1945), kept Bad Kreuznach from even greater destruction when he offered advancing American troops no resistance, and yielded the town to them on 16 March 1945 with barely any fighting. Shortly before this, German troops had blown up yet another part of the old bridge across the Nahe, thus also destroying residential buildings near the bridge ends.

====After 1945====
Bad Kreuznach was occupied by US troops in March 1945 and thus stood under American military authority. This even extended to one of the &quot;Rheinwiesenlager&quot; for disarmed German forces, which lay near Bad Kreuznach on the road to Bretzenheim, and whose former location is now marked by a memorial. It was commonly known as the &quot;Field of Misery&quot;. Found in the Lohrer Wald (forest) is a graveyard of honour for wartime and camp victims. Under the Potsdam Protocols on the fixing of occupation zone boundaries, Bad Kreuznach found itself for a while in French zone of occupation, but in an exchange in the early 1950s, United States Armed Forces came back into the districts of Kreuznach, Birkenfeld and Kusel. Until the middle of 2001, the Americans maintained four barracks, a Redstone missile unit, a firing range, a small airfield and a drill ground in Bad Kreuznach. The last US forces in Bad Kreuznach were parts of the 1st Armored Division (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;). In 1958, President of France Charles de Gaulle and Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer agreed in Bad Kreuznach to an institutionalisation of the special relations between the two countries, which in 1963 resulted in the Élysée Treaty. A monumental stone before the old spa house recalls this historic event. On 1 April 1960, the town of Bad Kreuznach was declared, after application to the state government, a &quot;große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (&quot;large town belonging to a district&quot;). In 2010 Bad Kreuznach launched a competition to replace the 1950s addition to the &quot;Alte Nahebrücke&quot; (&quot;Old Nahe Bridge&quot;). The bridge, designed by competition winner Dissing+Weitling architecture of Copenhagen, is scheduled for completion by 2012.

====Amalgamations====
In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, the hitherto self-administering municipalities of Bosenheim, Planig, Ippesheim (all three of which had belonged until then to the Bingen district) and Winzenheim were amalgamated on 7 June 1969 with Bad Kreuznach. Furthermore, Rüdesheim an der Nahe was also amalgamated, but fought the amalgamation in court, winning, and thereby regaining its autonomy a few months later. As part of the 2009 German federal election, a plebiscite was included on the ballot on the question of whether the towns of Bad Kreuznach and Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg should be merged, and 68.3% of the Bad Kreuznach voters favoured negotiations between the two towns. On 25 May 2009, the town received another special designation, this time from the Cabinet: &quot;Ort der Vielfalt&quot; – &quot;Place of Diversity&quot;.

As at 31 August 2013, there are 44,851 full-time residents in Bad Kreuznach, and of those, 15,431 are Protestant (34.405%), 13,355 are Catholic (29.776%), 4 belong to the Old Catholic Church (0.009%), 77 belong to the Greek Orthodox Church (0.172%), 68 belong to the Russian Orthodox Church (0.152%), 1 is United Methodist (0.002%), 16 belong to the Free Evangelical Church (0.036%), 41 are Lutheran (0.091%), 2 belong to the Palatinate State Free Religious Community (0.004%), 1 belongs to the Mainz Free Religious Community (0.002%), 4 are Reformed (0.009%), 9 belong to the Alzey Free Religious Community (0.02%), 2 form part of a membership group in a Jewish community (0.004%) (162 other Jews belong to the Bad Kreuznach-Koblenz worship community [0.361%] while a further one belongs to the State League of Jewish worship communities in Bavaria [0.002%]), 9 are Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.02%), 1 belongs to yet another free religious community (0.002%), 5,088 (11.344%) belong to other religious groups and 10,579 (23.587%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.

==Politics==

===Town council===
The council is made up of 44 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the chief mayor as chairwoman. Since this election, the town has been run by a Jamaica coalition of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the Free Democratic Party and the Greens.

The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:

===Mayors===

Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s current mayor (&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) is Emanuel Letz, elected in March 2022. Listed here are Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s mayors since Napoleonic times:
===Coat of arms===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: On an escutcheon argent ensigned with a town wall with three towers all embattled Or, a fess countercompony Or and azure between three crosses pattée sable.

Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s right to bear arms comes from municipal law for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The three crosses pattée (that is, with the ends somewhat broader than the rest of the crosses&#x27; arms) are a canting charge, referring to the town&#x27;s name, the German word for &quot;cross&quot; being &quot;Kreuz&quot;. The crosses are sometimes wrongly taken to be Christian crosses. In fact, the name Kreuznach developed out of the Celtic-Latin word &quot;Cruciniacum&quot;, which meant &quot;Crucinius&#x27;s Home&quot;, thus a man&#x27;s name with the suffix &quot;—acum&quot; added, meaning &quot;flowing water&quot;. The coat of arms first appeared with this composition on the keystone at Saint Nicholas&#x27;s Church in the late 13th century. The mural crown on top of the escutcheon began appearing only about 1800 under French rule. The stylised stretch of town wall was originally rendered reddish-brown, but it usually appears gold nowadays.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Bad Kreuznach is twinned with:
* Bourg-en-Bresse, France (1963)
* Neuruppin, Germany (1990)

===Sport and leisure===

==== Sport clubs ====
In Bad Kreuznach there are many clubs that can boast of successes at the national level. In trampolining and whitewater slalom, the town is a national stronghold, while it has also shown strength at the state level in shooting sports and bocce. The biggest club is &quot;VfL 1848 Bad Kreuznach&quot;, within which the first basketball department in any sport club in Germany was founded in 1935. After the Second World War, too, the club produced many important personalities, among them several players at the national level. Moreover, the club&#x27;s field hockey department is also of importance, having for a while been represented in the &quot;Damen-Bundesliga&quot; (&quot;Ladies&#x27; National League&quot;). The first field hockey department in a Bad Kreuznach sport club, however, was the &quot;Kreuznacher HC&quot;, which made it to the semi-finals at the German Championship in 1960, and which to this day stages the Easter Hockey Tournament. In football, the town&#x27;s most successful club is Eintracht Bad Kreuznach. The team played in, among other leagues, the Oberliga, when that was Germany&#x27;s highest level in football, as well as, later, the Second &quot;Bundesliga&quot;. The club that has won the most titles is MTV Bad Kreuznach, which in trampolining is among Germany&#x27;s most successful clubs. Canoeing, in particular whitewater slalom, is practised by RKV Bad Kreuznach. Creuznacher RV has a long tradition in rowing. Also important are the shooting sport clubs SG Bad Kreuznach 1847 and BSC Bad Kreuznach. In disabled sports, the Sportfreunde Diakonie especially has been successful, particularly in bocce.

====Town of Bad Kreuznach Sport Badge====

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Winegrowing===
Bad Kreuznach is characterised to a considerable extent by winegrowing, and with 777 ha of vineyard planted – 77% white wine varieties and 23% red – it is the biggest winegrowing centre in the Nahe wine region and the seventh biggest in Rhineland-Palatinate.

===Industry and trade===
Bad Kreuznach has roughly 1,600 businesses with at least one employee, thereby offering 28,000 jobs, of which half are filled by commuters who come into town from surrounding areas. The economic structure is thus characterised mainly by small and medium enterprises, but also some big businesses like the tire manufacturer Michelin, the machine builder KHS, the Meffert Farbwerke (dyes, lacquers, plasters, protective coatings) and the Jos. Schneider Optische Werke GmbH may be mentioned. In 2002, the tradition-rich Seitz-Filter-Werke was taken over by the US-based Pall Corporation. Thus producing businesses are of great importance, and are especially well represented by the chemical industry (tires, lacquers, dyes) and the optical industry as well as machine builders and automotive suppliers. Retail and wholesale dealers, as well as restaurants hold particular weight in the inner town, although in the last few years, the service sector, too, has been gaining in importance. The express road links to the Autobahn bring Bad Kreuznach closer to Frankfurt Airport. The town can also attract new investment with its economic conversion areas.

===Spa and tourism===
The spa operations and the wellness tourism also hold a special place for the town as the world&#x27;s oldest radon-brine spa and the Rhineland-Palatinate centre for rheumatic care. Available in town are 2,498* beds for guests, which out of 449,756* overnight stays have seen 270,306* stays by guests in rehabilitation clinics. All together, the town was visited by 92,700 overnight guests (*as of 31 December 2010). Also available to the spa operations are six spa clinics, spa sanatoria, the thermal brine movement bath &quot;Crucenia Thermen&quot; with a salt grotto, a radon gallery, graduation towers in the Salinental (dale), the brine-fogger in the &quot;Kurpark&quot; (spa park) set up as open-air inhalatoria and the &quot;Crucenia Gesundheitszentrum&quot; (&quot;Crucenia Health Centre&quot;) for ambulatory spa treatment. The indications for these treatments are for rheumatic complaints, changes in joints due to gout, degenerative diseases of the spinal column and joints, women&#x27;s complaints, illnesses of the respiratory system, paediatric illnesses, vascular illnesses, non-infectious skin diseases, endocrinological dysfunctions, psychosomatic illnesses and eye complaints. After the noticeable decline in the spa business in the mid 1990s, there was a remodelling of the healing spa. At the &quot;Saunalandschaft&quot; bathhouse rose a &quot;wellness temple&quot; with 12 great saunas on an area of 4 000 m2, which receives roughly 80,000 visitors every year.

===Hospitals and specialised clinics===
In the hospital run by &quot;kreuznacher diakonie&quot; (397 beds) and the St. Marienwörth hospital (Franciscan brothers), Bad Kreuznach has at its disposal two general hospitals that have available the most modern specialised departments for heart and intestinal disorders, and also strokes. In the spa zone, there is also the &quot;Sana&quot; Rhineland-Palatinate Rheumatic Centre, made up of a rheumatic hospital and a rehabilitation clinic, the &quot;Karl-Aschoff-Klinik&quot;. Another rehabilitation clinic under private sponsorship is the &quot;Klinik Nahetal&quot;. Also, there are the psychosomatic specialised clinic &quot;St.-Franziska-Stift&quot; and the rehabilitation and preventive clinic for children and youth, &quot;Viktoriastift&quot;.

===Transport===
Given Bad Kreuznach&#x27;s location in the narrow Nahe valley, all transport corridors run upstream parallel to the river. Moreover, the town is an important crossing point for all modes of transport.

====Rail====

From 1896 to 1936, there were the &quot;Kreuznacher Kleinbahnen&quot; (&quot;Kreuznach Narrow-Gauge Railways&quot;), a rural narrow-gauge railway network. An original steam locomotive and its shed, which were moved from Winterburg, can be found today in nearby Bockenau. The &quot;Kreuznacher Straßen- und Vorortbahnen&quot; (&quot;Kreuznach Tramways and Suburban Railways&quot;) ran not only a service within the town but also lines out into the surrounding area, to Bad Münster am Stein, Langenlonsheim and Sankt Johann. In 1953, the whole operation was shut down. Since the introduction of &quot;Rhineland-Palatinate Timetabling&quot; (&quot;Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt&quot;) in the mid 1990s, the train services other than the ICE/EC/IC services have once again earned some importance. Besides the introduction of hourly timetabling, there has also been a marked expansion into the nighttime hours, with trains leaving for Mainz three hours later each day. Bad Kreuznach station is one of Rhineland-Palatinate&#x27;s few V-shaped stations (called a &quot;Keilbahnhof&quot;, or &quot;wedge station&quot;, in the German terminology). Branching off the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken) here is the railway line to Gau Algesheim. From Bingen am Rhein, Regionalbahn trains run by way of the Alsenz Valley Railway, which branches off the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad Münster am Stein, to Kaiserslautern, reaching it in roughly 65 minutes. Running on the line to Saarbrücken and by way of Gau Algesheim and the West Rhine Railway to Mainz are Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The travel time to Mainz lies between 25 and 40 minutes, and to Saarbrücken between 1 hour and 40 minutes and 2 hours and 20 minutes.

====Road====
Bad Kreuznach can be reached by car through the like-named interchange on the Autobahn A 61 as well as on &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 41, 48 and 428. Except for &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 48, all these roads skirt the inner town, while the Autobahn is roughly 12 km from the town centre. Local public transport is provided by a town bus network with services running at 15- or 30-minute intervals. There are seven bus routes run by &quot;Verkehrsgesellschaft Bad Kreuznach&quot; (VGK), which is owned by the company Rhenus Veniro. Furthermore, there is a great number of regional bus routes serving the nearby area, run by VGK and &quot;Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe GmbH&quot; (ORN). The routes run by the various carriers are all part of the &quot;Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund&quot; (&quot;Rhine-Nahe Local Transport Association&quot;).

In 1950, the Max Planck Institute for Agricultural and Agricultural Engineering was moved from Imbshausen to Bad Kreuznach, where it used spaces of the Bangert knightly estate. From 1956 until its closure in 1976, it bore the name &quot;Max-Planck-Institut für Landarbeit und Landtechnik&quot;. From 1971 to 1987, the discipline of cultivation of the &quot;Fachhochschule Rheinland-Pfalz&quot;, Bingen, was located in Bad Kreuznach. Since it moved away to Bingen, Bad Kreuznach has been offering collegelike training for aspirant winemakers and agricultural technologists with the &quot;DLR&quot; (&quot;Dienstleistungszentrum Ländlicher Raum&quot;). This two-year &quot;Technikerschule für Weinbau und Oenologie sowie Landbau&quot; is a path within the agricultural economics college. It continues the tradition of the former, well known &quot;Höheren Weinbauschule&quot; (&quot;Higher Winegrowing School&quot;) and the &quot;Ingenieurschule für Landbau&quot; (&quot;Engineering School for Cultivation&quot;) and fills a gap in the training between Fachhochschule and one-year &quot;Fachschule&quot;. The &quot;Agentur für Qualitätssicherung, Evaluation und Selbstständigkeit von Schulen&quot; (&quot;Agency for Quality Assurance, Evaluation and Independence of Schools&quot;) and the &quot;Pädagogisches Zentrum Rheinland-Pfalz&quot; (&quot;Rhineland-Palatinate Paedagogical Centre&quot;), the latter of which the state&#x27;s schools support with their further paedagogical and didactic development, likewise have their seats in the town, as does the &quot;Staatliche Studienseminar Bad Kreuznach&quot; (a higher teachers&#x27; college). The Evangelical Church in the Rhineland maintained from 1960 to 2003 a seminary in Bad Kreuznach to train vicars.

==Sundry==
* In Eisenach, the well-to-do salesman and patrician Conrad Creutznacher had the later so-called &quot;Kreuznacher Haus&quot; (or &quot;Creuznacherhaus&quot;) built in the Renaissance style next to Saint George&#x27;s Church (&quot;Georgenkirche&quot;) in 1507/1539. In the early 17th century this was integrated into the residential palace (today Markt 9).
* In Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which came out in 1719, the title character tells the reader that his mother&#x27;s family originally bore the name &quot;Kreutznaer&quot; and had emigrated to England by way of Bremen. Since then, the surname Crusoe has been taken to be a corruption of the word &quot;Kreuznacher&quot; (&quot;person from Kreuznach&quot;). In 1720, at first anonymously, Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Memoirs of a Cavalier&quot; appeared, in which receipts from &quot;Creutznach&quot; are described.
* Marcel Proust visited the town with his mother in 1895.
* Bad Kreuznach is known among photographers as the home of Schneider Optische Werke, a famous photographic lens maker.

<text>The Swindon and Cricklade Railway is a heritage railway in Wiltshire, England, that operates on a short section of the old Midland and South Western Junction Railway line between Swindon and Cricklade.

Swindon and Cricklade Railway is a registered charity.

== Preservation history ==
The Swindon and Cricklade Railway Preservation Society was formed by a group of enthusiasts in November 1978 to reconstruct and preserve a section of the Midland &amp; South Western Junction Railway that ran from Andover, Hampshire, to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

The volunteer-operated railway has reopened three stations: , and , the headquarters of the line. Hayes Knoll features a restored signalbox that is operational during special events and a running/restoration shed. The length of the restored line is a little under .

The line extends north to South Meadow Lane (a few hundred yards from the site of a proposed Farfield Lane halt) near Cricklade, and south to Taw Valley Halt on the outskirts of Swindon, near Mouldon Hill Country Park. A southern terminus, , is proposed within the park.

<text>Pashmina (, ) refers to, depending on the source, the cashmere wool of the Changthangi cashmere goat, fine Kashmiri cashmere wool, or any cashmere wool.

The word &quot;pashm&quot; means &quot;wool&quot; in Persian, but in Kashmir, &quot;pashm&quot; referred to the raw unspun wool of domesticated Changthangi goats. In common parlance today, &quot;pashmina&quot; may refer either to the material or to the variant of the Kashmir shawl that is made from it. Both cashmere and pashmina come from the same goat but typical cashmere ranges from 12 to 21 microns in diameter, whereas &quot;pashmina&quot; can also refer to a cashmere and silk blend (70% / 30%) that has a typical fiber range from 12 to 16 microns.

==History==

Samples of wool fibres recovered from corroded copper artifacts from Harappa dating back to the Indus Valley Civilisation are believed to be Pashmina and Shahtoosh. The material gained prominence through its use in the Kashmir shawl. In Mughal times, this was used as an indicator of rank and nobility. In 1526, Babur (1483–1530) founded the Mughal Empire in India, and established the practice of giving khalat or &quot;robes of honor&quot;, typically made of expensive fabric, to members of their &quot;durbar&quot; to indicate high service, great achievement, or royal favor. In his time, the Mughal khalat was a set of clothes, which could include a turban, long coat, gown, fitted jacket, sash, shawl, trousers, shirt, and scarf. One or all of these could be made of &quot;pashmina&quot; and embroidered in gold cloth. In 1568, Kashmir was conquered by Babur&#x27;s grandson Akbar. In Akbar&#x27;s time, a pair of &quot;pashmina&quot; shawls was an expected part of &quot;khil&#x27;at&quot; ceremonies. From the 16th to the early 20th centuries, the Safavid, Zand, and Qajar emperors of Iran also wore &quot;pashmina&quot; and gifted Kashmir shawls as &quot;khilat&quot; within their political and religious practices.

Pashmina blankets were also part of a wealthy woman&#x27;s dowry in India, Pakistan and Nepal. In nineteenth-century English literature Kashmiri shawls were coded as women&#x27;s luxuries. They acquired the status of heirlooms, worn by a girl on her marriage and coming-of-age. They were inherited rather than purchased. Since English law restricted women&#x27;s abilities to inherit land, the Kashmir shawl served as an item of high exchange value that a woman could carry. In France, the &quot;pashmina&quot; Kashmir shawl gained status as a fashion icon through Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais&#x27; enthusiastic use. These shawls suited the French well, providing the needed warmth, while adding visual interest to white French gowns through the traditional teardrop &quot;buta&quot; pattern and discreet floral motifs. The shawl became a symbol of French bourgeois status from the Bourbon Restoration (1815–48) through the Second French Empire (1852–70). As a class marker, it fulfilled 19th century French tastes because it looked rich, had extensive ornamentation, artistic qualities, and was made of expensive raw materials.

== Production ==

Goats used for pashmina shed their winter coat every spring. One goat sheds approximately of the fibre. In the spring (the moulting season), the goats naturally shed their undercoat, which regrows in winter. This undercoat is collected by combing the goat, not by shearing, as in other fine wools. A traditional producer of pashmina wool in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas are a people known as the Changpa. These are a nomadic people and inhabit the Changthang plateau of Tibet, which has a minimum altitude of above sea level and a winter temperature which can drop to The Changpa rear sheep in these harsh climates for meat, and pashmina goats for wool.

Raw pashmina is exported to Kashmir. All steps, from combing (removing impurities and guard hair, and aligning fibers) and spinning, to weaving and finishing, are traditionally carried out by hand by specialized craftsmen and women. The major center of pashmina fabric production is in the old district of the city of Srinagar. The approximate time put into producing a single traditional pashmina stole (70x200cm) is 180 hours.

China accounts for 70% of the world&#x27;s cashmere production, Mongolia 20%, and the remaining 10% of production is in Afghanistan, Australia, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, the United States, the Central Asian republics and elsewhere. Only a small percentage of this production is the ultra-fine cashmere known as pashmina.

==Products==
Pashmina accessories are renowned for their softness and warmth. They are produced in a range of sizes, from &quot;scarf&quot; 30 in x 80 in (70 cm x 200 cm)

to full- sized shawl measuring 40 in x 80 in (100 cm x 200 cm), large shawls measuring 45 in x 90 in (114 cm x 228 cm), and XL shawls measuring 54 in x 108 in (137 cm x 274 cm).

A craze for pashmina shawls, known as &quot;shahmina&quot; in Kashmir, in the mid-1990s resulted in high demand for the raw material, so demand exceeded supply. When these shawls rose into fashion prominence during the era, they were marketed dubiously. In the consumer markets, pashmina shawls have been redefined as a shawl/wrap with cashmere and cashmere/silk, notwithstanding the actual meaning of pashmina. Some shawls marketed as pashmina shawls contain (sheep) wool, while other unscrupulous companies marketed artificial fabrics such as viscose and others as &quot;pashmina&quot; with deceptive marketing statements such as &quot;authentic viscose pashmina&quot;.

The word &quot;pashmina&quot; is not a labelling term recognized by law in the United States where it is considered another term for cashmere. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission:

Some manufacturers use the term pashmina to describe an ultra fine cashmere fiber; others use the term to describe a blend of cashmere and silk. The FTC encourages manufacturers and sellers of products described as pashmina to explain to consumers, on a hangtag, for example, what they mean by the term.As with all other wool products, the fiber content of a shawl, scarf or other item marketed as pashmina must be accurately disclosed. For example, a blend of cashmere and silk might be labeled 50% Cashmere, 50% Silk or 70% Cashmere, 30% Silk, depending upon the actual cashmere and silk content. If the item contains only cashmere, it should be labeled 100% Pashmina or All Cashmere by the Wool Act or regulations.

The earliest shawls had no particular motifs but they had striped in various colours. As time passed, the weavers derived inspiration from nature. Many floral motifs emerged. There is a strong Persian influence in the designs. There are few remnants of the mid 19th century European influence as well.  Chand-dar or Moon shawl had a medallion in the center and quarters in the corner. The patterns almost covered the ground colour.   Various butis and badam shapes are the popular motifs.

<text>Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway (VER) is a narrow gauge heritage railway that runs along a length of the seafront of the English seaside resort of Brighton. It was built by Magnus Volk, the first section being completed in August 1883, and is the oldest operational electric railway in the world, though it was not the first electric railway to be built. It was preceded by electrification of Miller&#x27;s line in 1875, Werner von Siemens&#x27; 1879 demonstration line in Berlin and by the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway of 1881, although none of these remain in operation.

Operated as an historical seafront tourist attraction, the railway does not usually run during the winter months, and its service is also liable to occasional suspension due to severe weather or maintenance issues.

==History==
===Volk family===
On 3 August 1883, Magnus Volk opened a electric railway running for between Swimming Arch (opposite the main entrance to Brighton Aquarium, and adjacent to the site of the future Palace Pier) and Chain Pier. Electrical power at 50 V DC was supplied to the small car using the two running rails. On 4 April 1884, the line was extended a further beyond the Chain Pier to Paston Place (now known as Halfway), and regauged to . The electrical supply was increased to 160 V DC and the power plant was installed in the arch built into the cliff face at Paston Place. In 1886 an off-set third rail was added to minimise current leakage.

In 1896, the Brighton and Rottingdean Seashore Electric Railway was built by Volk. Owing to problems concerning the construction of lengthened groynes to the east of Paston Place this closed in 1901, although it was not finally dismantled until 1910. Following the closure Volk&#x27;s original electric railway was extended from Paston Place (today&#x27;s Halfway) to Black Rock on 21 February 1901. Paston Place was also the home of Volk&#x27;s Seaplane Station, which was used by Volk&#x27;s son George Herbert Volk. In 1930, the line was cut back from Palace Pier to its present terminus, still known as Aquarium. In 1935 a lido was built at Black Rock, and the line was shortened by around to accommodate it. In 1937, a new Black Rock station was opened at the end of the shortened line.

===Brighton Corporation===

In April 1940, Brighton Corporation took control of the line. On 2 July 1940, World War II defensive preparations resulted in the line closing. After the war, starting in 1947, the corporation rebuilt the line using rail for the running line and mounted on insulators for the third rail. At Black Rock, a new station was built to replace the 1937 building which had suffered badly during the war. The line reopened for passengers in 1948.

Winter operation ceased from 1954, although the line did reopen temporarily in the winter of 1980 to cash in on the large numbers of sightseers who had come to look at the &quot;Athina B&quot;, a freighter that had beached near the Palace Pier. Two-car multiple operation was introduced in 1964. In 1995 the Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway Association was formed to help Brighton &amp; Hove City Council promote and operate the line. In 2003 the Volk&#x27;s Railway Institute of Science and Technology was formed to promote the educational and science side of the Victorian railway to schools and special interest groups.

In the late 1990s, the Black Rock end of the line was shortened by 211 feet to permit a storm water storage scheme to be built in the marina area. The 1948 station was demolished and replaced by a new single platform station, which opened in 1998 and shares a building with a new Southern Water pumping station.

===Lottery funding===
In 2014, it was announced that the railway had been awarded a grant of £1.6 million by the Heritage Lottery Fund, a sum which had to be spent by March 2017. The work funded included: the provision of a new visitor centre and ticket office at the Aquarium station; a new five-road depot (four stock roads and one through running line) with engineering facilities, inspection pit, and public viewing gallery at Halfway; the restoration of cars 4, 6, and 10 from a semi-derelict state to full working order; and the provision of new educational materials about the railway.
==Route==
===Overview===
Today the line runs between terminal stations at Aquarium (a short distance from the Palace Pier) and Black Rock (at Black Rock, not far from Brighton Marina), with an intermediate station and depot at Halfway.

The line has a narrow gauge, is electrified at 110 V DC using a third rail, and is long.

There are no branch lines, although there was originally a branch at Paston Place (now Halfway), with a line running across Madeira Drive and into the railway&#x27;s workshops, which were located (with Magnus Volk&#x27;s office) inside the cliff on the landward side of the road.

===Stations===
&quot;Palace Pier&quot; was the original terminus of 1883 in the centre of Brighton. Named &quot;Aquarium&quot; at the original opening, it was renamed &quot;Palace Pier&quot; in 1899 when the pier of that name was opened to the public. The station was closed in 1930 when the western end of the railway was shortened to allow the widening of Madeira Drive.

&quot;Aquarium&quot; station opened in 1930, as the new western terminus of the line following its shortening. As the new station was closer to the old Brighton Aquarium than the Palace Pier, the new station revived the old &quot;Aquarium&quot; name. It remains the western terminus. Originally provided with two platforms, one was closed in the 1960s, and the tracks were later taken up, leaving today&#x27;s station as single-platform. The station was completely rebuilt in 2016-2017 and now has toilets, a cafeteria, staff rooms, a ticket office, and an exhibition centre.

&quot;Halfway&quot; station is located in the middle of the railway, and has previously been known as &quot;Paston Place&quot;, &quot;Children&#x27;s Playground&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground&quot;. The original station opened in 1884 when the line was extended, and was both the eastern terminus and the depot. Volk also built his own offices at this location, inland from the station. The original station was located on the same site as the depot, and remained there until the station remodelling just after the second world war, when the new station platforms and passenger shelters were constructed about further west than the original site. The station has two platform faces, on a single central island platform, in the centre of a passing loop. There is a public viewing gallery in the neighbouring railway depot and workshop.

&quot;Black Rock&quot; station opened in 1901 when the railway was extended eastwards. The original station, with two platforms, a ticket office, and a waiting room, was situated in an isolated location. Subsequently, a corporation swimming pool gave further purpose to the location, and today it is close to the thriving Brighton Marina. The original station was replaced in 1911 with a much larger bungalow-style building. This was in turn closed and demolished in the winter of 1936-1937 when the line was shortened to allow for the construction of the Black Rock swimming pool. The new &quot;Black Rock&quot; station opened in May 1937, still with two platforms. The station building was again rebuilt in 1948 in Art Deco style, still with two platforms, although from the mid-1960s the south platform was abandoned. In the 1980s the second (south) platform was restored and used for special school visits trains, operating around the timetabled service. This was short-lived, and in 1989 the south platform track was lifted. The station was briefly renamed &quot;Marina Station&quot; in the early 1990s, but was in turn demolished in the mid-1990s during a storm drain project, with a new station building opened in 1998. This new station, which reverted to the original &quot;Black Rock&quot; name, was provided with only one platform (plus ticket office and toilets), and remains in current use.

No other stations are in current use, although there have been halts associated with intermediate passing loops. Former intermediate passing loop halts have been known as &quot;Sussex Square&quot; (or &quot;Lift&quot;), and &quot;Kemp Town&quot;. There was also a temporary &quot;Black Rock&quot; station constructed, with platform and booking office, during the storm drain project of the mid-1990s.

==Signalling==
The line is single throughout, with three passing loops - one at Halfway station and two others roughly midway between each terminal station and Halfway. The passing loops are equipped with spring loaded turnouts. These are set so that trains entering a loop are routed to the left track. Trains can exit the loop by pushing the switch blade to the appropriate position. In normal service two trains operate from end to end, passing at Halfway station, and there is generally only one train on each single track section at any one time. This is sufficient to provide a 15-minute interval service. Drivers are now equipped with radios which allow communication between each other, stations and control.

Nevertheless, the line is operated using single track tokens. There are four colour coded tokens, one each for the sections between Aquarium and the first passing loop (red token), the passing loop and Halfway (yellow token), Halfway to the next passing loop (blue token), and the passing loop to Black Rock (white token). In practice, the two pairs of tokens (for the two sections west of Halfway, and for the two sections east of Halfway) are permanently combined into a single dual token, marked with two colours, as full operation of the line as four block sections is very rare. Due to the low line speed, multiple trains are able to operate in each section, but the token must be carried on the train furthest from Halfway.

There are warning lights at pedestrian crossing points to the beach with a warbling siren to warn of the approach of a train. A following train is required to signal its approach to a pedestrian crossing point by sounding its klaxon horn. One such crossing provides the only external access to Halfway station.

==Rolling Stock==
The numbering of cars can cause some confusion as numbers were duplicated when new cars replaced scrapped vehicles. In 1948, cars Nos. 8, 9 and 10 were renumbered 5, 2 and 1 respectively after the cars bearing those numbers were scrapped. All cars reverted to their original numbers in the year 2000. The cars were often built in pairs. Currently, there are seven electric cars and one diesel locomotive in operation on the line with an additional two electric cars on static display elsewhere.

The railway also has a few service wagons that are used with the diesel locomotive.

A highly detailed model of Volks car 6 is on show in the foyer of the Brighton Toy and Model Museum, donated by Siemens which provided much of the electrical equipment used on the railway.

==Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway Association (VERA)==
At the invitation of the council and the management of the railway, a supporters&#x27; group, The Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway Association, was formed in 1995. Members provide practical and promotional help to the railway, including operation and maintenance tasks. The association also attends various exhibitions with a large operating model of the railway as it was in the 1950s. Membership is open to all with an interest in the railway. Members receive a quarterly magazine, reduced rate travel on the railway and free admission to a series of winter meetings held in Brighton. The association also acts as a collector for Volk&#x27;s memorabilia and ephemera, some of which can be seen at the South Downs Heritage Centre in Hassocks. The largest artefact now in the care of the association is the ex-Southend car which, between 1950 and 2000, carried the Volk&#x27;s fleet number 9. Plans were drawn up to restore car 3 as a two-year joint project.

<text>Clay minerals are hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates (e.g. kaolin, Al2Si2O5(OH)4), sometimes with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations found on or near some planetary surfaces.

Clay minerals form in the presence of water and have been important to life, and many theories of abiogenesis involve them. They are important constituents of soils, and have been useful to humans since ancient times in agriculture and manufacturing.

== Properties ==

Clay is a very fine-grained geologic material that develops plasticity when wet, but becomes hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. It is a very common material, and is the oldest known ceramic. Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay and used it for making pottery. The chemistry of clay, including its capacity to retain nutrient cations such as potassium and ammonium, is important to soil fertility.

Because the individual particles in clay are less than in size, they cannot be characterized by ordinary optical or physical methods. The crystallographic structure of clay minerals became better understood in the 1930s with advancements in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique indispensable to deciphering their crystal lattice. Clay particles were found to be predominantly sheet silicate (phyllosilicate) minerals, now grouped together as clay minerals. Their structure is based on flat hexagonal sheets similar to those of the mica group of minerals. Standardization in terminology arose during this period as well, with special attention given to similar words that resulted in confusion, such as sheet and plane.

Because clay minerals are usually (but not necessarily) ultrafine-grained, special analytical techniques are required for their identification and study. In addition to X-ray crystallography, these include electron diffraction methods, various spectroscopic methods such as Mössbauer spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDS or automated mineralogy processes. These methods can be augmented by polarized light microscopy, a traditional technique establishing fundamental occurrences or petrologic relationships.

== Occurrence ==
Clay minerals are common weathering products (including weathering of feldspar) and low-temperature hydrothermal alteration products. Clay minerals are very common in soils, in fine-grained sedimentary rocks such as shale, mudstone, and siltstone and in fine-grained metamorphic slate and phyllite.

Given the requirement of water, clay minerals are relatively rare in the Solar System, though they occur extensively on Earth where water has interacted with other minerals and organic matter. Clay minerals have been detected at several locations on Mars, including Echus Chasma, Mawrth Vallis, the Memnonia quadrangle and the Elysium quadrangle. Spectrography has confirmed their presence on celestial bodies including the dwarf planet Ceres, asteroid 101955 Bennu, and comet Tempel 1, as well as Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa.

== Structure ==

Like all phyllosilicates, clay minerals are characterised by two-dimensional &quot;sheets&quot; of corner-sharing tetrahedra or octahedra. The sheet units have the chemical composition . Each silica tetrahedron shares three of its vertex oxygen ions with other tetrahedra, forming a hexagonal array in two dimensions. The fourth oxygen ion is not shared with another tetrahedron and all of the tetrahedra &quot;point&quot; in the same direction; i.e. all of the unshared oxygen ions are on the same side of the sheet. These unshared oxygen ions are called apical oxygen ions.

In clays, the tetrahedral sheets are always bonded to octahedral sheets formed from small cations, such as aluminum or magnesium, and coordinated by six oxygen atoms. The unshared vertex from the tetrahedral sheet also forms part of one side of the octahedral sheet, but an additional oxygen atom is located above the gap in the tetrahedral sheet at the center of the six tetrahedra. This oxygen atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom forming an OH group in the clay structure. Clays can be categorized depending on the way that tetrahedral and octahedral sheets are packaged into &quot;layers&quot;. If there is only one tetrahedral and one octahedral group in each layer the clay is known as a 1:1 clay. The alternative, known as a 2:1 clay, has two tetrahedral sheets with the unshared vertex of each sheet pointing towards each other and forming each side of the octahedral sheet.

Bonding between the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets requires that the tetrahedral sheet becomes corrugated or twisted, causing ditrigonal distortion to the hexagonal array, and the octahedral sheet is flattened. This minimizes the overall bond-valence distortions of the crystallite.

Depending on the composition of the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, the layer will have no charge or will have a net negative charge. If the layers are charged this charge is balanced by interlayer cations such as Na+ or K+ or by a lone octahedral sheet. The interlayer may also contain water. The crystal structure is formed from a stack of layers interspaced with the interlayers.

== Classification ==
Clay minerals can be classified as 1:1 or 2:1. A 1:1 clay would consist of one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, and examples would be kaolinite and serpentinite. A 2:1 clay consists of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets, and examples are talc, vermiculite, and montmorillonite. The layers in 1:1 clays are uncharged and are bonded by hydrogen bonds between layers, but 2:1 layers have a net negative charge and may be bonded together either by individual cations (such as potassium in illite or sodium or calcium in smectites) or by positively charged octahedral sheets (as in chlorites).

Clay minerals include the following groups:
* Kaolin group which includes the minerals kaolinite, dickite, halloysite, and nacrite (polymorphs of ).
** Some sources include the kaolinite-serpentine group due to structural similarities.
* Smectite group which includes dioctahedral smectites, such as montmorillonite, nontronite and beidellite, and trioctahedral smectites, such as saponite. In 2013, analytical tests by the Curiosity rover found results consistent with the presence of &quot;smectite clay minerals&quot; on the planet Mars.
* Illite group which includes the clay-micas. Illite is the only common mineral in this group.
* Chlorite group includes a wide variety of similar minerals with considerable chemical variation.
* Other 2:1 clay types exist such as palygorskite (also known as attapulgite) and sepiolite, clays with long water channels internal to their structure.

Mixed layer clay variations exist for most of the above groups. Ordering is described as a random or regular order and is further described by the term reichweite, which is German for range or reach. Literature articles will refer to an R1 ordered illite-smectite, for example. This type would be ordered in an illite-smectite-illite-smectite (ISIS) fashion. R0 on the other hand describes random ordering, and other advanced ordering types are also found (R3, etc.). Mixed layer clay minerals which are perfect R1 types often get their own names. R1 ordered chlorite-smectite is known as corrensite, R1 illite-smectite is rectorite.
&quot;X-ray rf(001)&quot; is the spacing between layers in nanometers, as determined by X-ray crystallography. &quot;Glycol (mg/g)&quot; is the adsorption capacity for glycol, which occupies the interlayer sites when the clay is exposed to a vapor of ethylene glycol at for eight hours. &quot;CEC&quot; is the cation exchange capacity of the clay. &quot; (%)&quot; is the percent content of potassium oxide in the clay. &quot;DTA&quot; describes the differential thermal analysis curve of the clay.

== Clay and the origins of life ==

The clay hypothesis for the origin of life was proposed by Graham Cairns-Smith in 1985. It postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in contact with an aqueous solution. The clay mineral montmorillonite has been shown to catalyze the polymerization of RNA in aqueous solution from nucleotide monomers, and the formation of membranes from lipids. In 1998, Hyman Hartman proposed that &quot;the first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic acid and other dicarboxylic acids. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hot spring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids.&quot;

== Biomedical applications of clays ==
The structural and compositional versatility of clay minerals gives them interesting biological properties. Due to disc-shaped and charged surfaces, clay interacts with a range of drugs, protein, polymers, DNA, or other macromolecules. Some of the applications of clays include drug delivery, tissue engineering, and bioprinting.

== Mortar applications ==
Clay minerals can be incorporated in lime-metakaolin mortars to improve mechanical properties. Electrochemical separation helps to obtain modified saponite-containing products with high smectite-group minerals concentrations, lower mineral particles size, more compact structure, and greater surface area. These characteristics open possibilities for the manufacture of high-quality ceramics and heavy-metal sorbents from saponite-containing products. 
Furthermore, tail grinding occurs during the preparation of the raw material for ceramics; this waste reprocessing is of high importance for the use of clay pulp as a neutralizing agent, as fine particles are required for the reaction. Experiments on the histosol deacidification with the alkaline clay slurry demonstrated that neutralization with the average pH level of 7.1 is reached at 30% of the pulp added and an experimental site with perennial grasses proved the efficacy of the technique. Moreover, the reclamation of disturbed lands is an integral part of the social and environmental responsibility of the mining company and this scenario addresses the community necessities at both local and regional levels.

==The tests which verify that clay minerals are present==
The results of glycol adsorption, cation exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and chemical tests all give data that may be used for quantitative estimations. After the quantities of organic matter, carbonates, free oxides, and nonclay minerals have been determined, the percentages of clay minerals are estimated using the appropriate glycol adsorption, cation exchange capacity, K20, and DTA data. The amount of illite is estimated from the K20 content since this is the only clay mineral containing potassium.

== Argillaceous rocks ==
Argillaceous rocks are those in which clay minerals are a significant component. For example, &quot;argillaceous limestones&quot; are limestones consisting predominantly of calcium carbonate, but including 10-40% of clay minerals: such limestones, when soft, are often called marls. Similarly, &quot;argillaceous sandstones&quot; such as greywacke, are sandstones consisting primarily of quartz grains, with the interstitial spaces filled with clay minerals.

<doc id="1161456" wikidata="Q175292" url="?curid=1161456" title="Seaboard Air Line Railroad">
<text>The Seaboard Air Line Railroad , known colloquially as the Seaboard Railroad during its time, was an American railroad that existed from April 14, 1900, until July 1, 1967, when it merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, its longtime rival, to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. Its predecessor railroads dated from the 1830s and reorganized extensively to rebuild after the American Civil War, and by 1900 had merged together to form the SAL. The company was headquartered in Portsmouth, Virginia until 1958, when its main offices were relocated to Richmond, Virginia.

Styling itself as &quot;The Route of Courteous Service&quot;, Seaboard, along with its main competitors Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Florida East Coast Railway and Southern Railway, contributed greatly to the economic development of the Southeastern United States, and particularly to that of Florida throughout the first half of the 20th century. Its trains brought vacationers to Florida from the Northeast and carried southern timber, minerals and produce, especially Florida citrus crops, to the northern states. 

At the end of 1925 SAL operated 3,929 miles of road, not including its flock of subsidiaries; at the end of 1960 it reported 4,135 miles. The main line ran from Richmond, Virginia to Tampa, Florida via Raleigh, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville itself was a major interchange point for passenger trains bringing travelers to the Sunshine State. Seaboard rails continued around Tampa Bay to St. Petersburg, and by 1927 extended to West Palm Beach and Miami starting from Wildwood.

Other important Seaboard routes included a line from Jacksonville via Tallahassee to a connection with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) at Chattahoochee, Florida, for through service to New Orleans; a line to Atlanta, Georgia, and Birmingham, Alabama, connecting with the main line at Hamlet, North Carolina; and a line from the main at Norlina, North Carolina, to Portsmouth, Virginia, the earliest route of what became the Seaboard.

==History==

===Early 19th century===
The complex corporate history of the Seaboard began on March 8, 1832, when its earliest predecessor, the Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad was chartered by the legislatures of Virginia and North Carolina to build a railroad from Portsmouth, Virginia, to the Roanoke River port of Weldon, North Carolina. After a couple of months of horse-drawn operation, the first locomotive-pulled service on this line began on September 4, 1834, with a twice-daily train from Portsmouth to Suffolk, Virginia, 17 miles away.

By June 1837 the railroad was completed to Weldon, where a connection was made with the tracks of the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). In 1846, after suffering financial difficulties, the P&amp;R was reorganized as the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, known informally as the Seaboard Road.

Meanwhile, the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad had begun construction on November 1, 1836, with the first scheduled service between its endpoints beginning on March 21, 1840. After the American Civil War, this was advertised as the Inland Air-Line Route. By 1853, the Raleigh and Gaston had connected with the Seaboard and Roanoke at Weldon, thus offering travelers through service on the 176-mile route from Portsmouth to Raleigh. Both railroads were built to , rather than the gauge favored by most other railroads in the South; therefore, cars of both roads could run on the entire route, eliminating the need for travelers or freight to make a change of cars.

The R&amp;G takeover also gave the P&amp;R control of the Raleigh &amp; Augusta Air-Line Railroad which the former road controlled. This was the first time &quot;Air Line&quot; appeared as part of a Seaboard predecessor. The R&amp;AA-L began as the Chatham Railroad, chartered by the state on February 14, 1855 (from the 1877 booklet, &quot;History Of The Raleigh &amp; August Air-Line Railroad&quot; compiled by Walter Clark, Attorney At Law) to build a rail line, &quot;...between Deep River, at or near the Coalfields, Moncure, NC in the county of Chatham, and the City of Raleigh or some point on the North Carolina Railroad.&quot; The project was riddled with delays and finally reorganized as the Raleigh &amp; Augusta Air-Line in 1871. It eventually reached Hamlet in 1877 which in later years was a major SAL terminal point. With a route that now extended through North Carolina the three roads offered a competitive network serving several important cities. The South was also blossoming into an industrial giant in the area of cotton, agriculture/farming, textiles, and manufacturing.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

The American Civil War devastated railroads, particularly in former Confederate territories including Virginia and North Carolina. After the war, Moncure Robinson and Alexander Boyd Andrews organized the Seaboard Inland Air Line to connect Georgia and South Carolina to Portsmouth, Virginia (in the Hampton Roads area across from Norfolk, Virginia). They worked with Confederate general turned Republican political boss William Mahone to work against the conglomeration of railroads reorganized by Thomas A. Scott, who had moved up the ranks of the Pennsylvania Railroad, took control of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad after the Civil War, and tried to work with African American legislators to acquire (and rebuild) railroads further South. As it had before the Civil War, Virginia paid millions to get railroads rebuilt and commerce moving through its cities. Charges of corruption against Scott, and resentment against northern and black workers led to volatile situations in many areas. Eruptions of Ku Klux Klan violence centered on railroads through interior North and South Carolina.
Together the R&amp;G, P&amp;R, and R&amp;AA-L formed the backbone of the future Seaboard Air Line. Moncure Robinson&#x27;s son John M. Robinson acquired financial control of the trio in 1875. As a marketing tactic they were collectively known as the &quot;Seaboard Air-Line System.&quot; The name initially had no legal authority, although that changed as Robinson continued to extend southward. The first known official use of &quot;Seaboard Air Line&quot; appeared when the system was pushing towards Atlanta. It had already acquired the Georgia, Carolina &amp; Northern Railway which intended to reach that city from Monroe, North Carolina. Construction began in 1887 and was completed as far as Inman Park, east of Atlanta, by 1892. However, an ordinance prevented it from reaching the city directly. To circumvent this issue the Seaboard Air Line Belt Railroad (SALB) was chartered in 1892 to build an 8-mile branch and a connection with the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis at Howells. From there the SALB utilized trackage rights over the Dixie Line to reach the downtown area. Just prior to this event Robinson would link Rutherfordton and Wilmington, North Carolina via Charlotte and Hamlet by acquiring the Carolina Central Railroad in 1883. Rail service between these cities opened in 1887.

====The &quot;air line&quot; name====

In the days before air travel, &quot;air line&quot; was a common term for the shortest distance between two points: a straight line drawn through the air (or on a map), ignoring natural obstacles (i.e., &quot;as the crow flies&quot;). Hence, a number of 19th-century railroads used &quot;air line&quot; in their titles to suggest that their routes were shorter than those of competing roads: see list at Air-line railroad.

The Seaboard never owned an airplane. In 1940 the railroad proposed the creation of &quot;Seaboard Airlines,&quot; but this idea was struck down by the Interstate Commerce Commission as violating federal anti-trust legislation.

During a spate of interest in aviation shares on Wall Street following Charles A. Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight in 1927, Seaboard Air Line shares actually attracted some investor curiosity because of the name&#x27;s aviation-related connotations; only after noticing that Seaboard Air Line was actually a railroad did investors lose interest.

===Late 19th century===

The railroads&#x27; prosperous operations of the 1850s, hauling passengers as well as valuable cargos of cotton, tobacco and produce from the Piedmont to the tidewater port of Portsmouth, were interrupted by the Civil War, during which bridges and tracks of both railroads were destroyed at various times by Union or Confederate troops.

Prosperity returned after the war, with the efficiently managed Seaboard Road showing a profit even during the Panic of 1873, and paying stockholders an annual dividend of 8 percent for many years. In 1871, the Raleigh and Gaston acquired the Raleigh and Augusta Air-Line Railroad, which, however, reached only to Hamlet, North Carolina. When the R&amp;G and its subsidiary fell into financial straits in 1873, the Seaboard&#x27;s president, John M. Robinson, acquired financial control of them, becoming president of all three railroads in 1875.

====The Seaboard Air-Line System====

By 1881, the Seaboard and Roanoke, the Raleigh and Gaston, and others were operating as a coordinated system under the Seaboard Air-Line System name for marketing purposes, combining the nicknames of the two principal roads. In 1889, the Seaboard leased the still-unfinished Georgia, Carolina and Northern Railway, providing a link from Monroe, North Carolina, (on the Seaboard line to Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired in 1881) to Atlanta, Georgia, (completed in 1892).

During its heyday in the 1890s, the system prided itself on offering excellent passenger service between Atlanta and the northeast. A daily coach and Pullman train, the &quot;S.A.L. Express&quot;, ran from Atlanta to the Seaboard Road&#x27;s depot and wharf at Portsmouth, where passengers could transfer to steamships for direct passage to Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. The system&#x27;s premier train, however, was the &quot;Atlanta Special&quot;, running in daily service between Atlanta and Washington, using the Atlantic Coast Line&#x27;s tracks from Weldon to Richmond, and the tracks of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac from Richmond to Washington.

Between 1898 and 1900, Seaboard affiliate Richmond, Petersburg and Carolina completed the laying of track from Norlina to Richmond, thereby providing an all-Seaboard route from Atlanta to Richmond.

As important as the route to the major railroad hub of Atlanta was, access to Florida resorts and markets would be even more important to the railroad&#x27;s success in years to come. In the last two decades of the 19th century, the pieces of the route to Florida began to fall into place. Between 1885 and 1887, the Palmetto Railroad, later reorganized as the Palmetto Railway, had built southward from Hamlet, North Carolina, on the Seaboard main line, to Cheraw, South Carolina. In 1895, the Seaboard took control of the Palmetto Railway and extended the tracks to Columbia.

Also in 1895, the Savannah, Americus and Montgomery Railway, a Savannah-to-Montgomery route, was bought by a syndicate that included the Richmond bankers John L. Williams and Sons. John Skelton Williams, a son of John L. Williams, became president of the line, renaming it the Georgia and Alabama Railway. In January 1899, the Williams syndicate offered to purchase a majority of shares in the Seaboard and Roanoke, which included controlling interests in each of the affiliated companies and subordinated railroads in the Seaboard Air Line system. Although a New York syndicate of various stockholders headed by Thomas Fortune Ryan bitterly opposed the deal, control of all of the railroad properties comprising the Seaboard system was formally transferred to the Williams syndicate in February 1899. Immediately, Williams and his financial backers sought to expand into the Florida market.

====Seaboard predecessors in Florida====

In 1860, the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad (FA&amp;GC) completed construction of a line running west from Jacksonville, Florida, to Lake City, Florida. That same year, the Florida Railroad opened from Fernandina, just north of Jacksonville, southwest to Cedar Key on the Gulf Coast. In 1863, the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad (P&amp;G) completed a line running east from Quincy, Florida, through Tallahassee to Lake City, where it connected with the FA&amp;GC.

In 1868, the P&amp;G and the FA&amp;GC were acquired by carpetbaggers, with the P&amp;G being renamed the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad (JP&amp;M), into which the FA&amp;GC — now called the Florida Central Railroad — was consolidated in 1870. Meanwhile, in 1871, the Florida Railroad was reorganized as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company. Through two new subsidiaries, the Peninsular Railroad and the Tropical Florida Railroad, the Atlantic, Gulf and West India opened two new lines, one running to Ocala and Tampa from a junction with the main line at Waldo, and another running from Ocala to Wildwood.

In 1881, Sir Edward Reed acquired the Atlantic, Gulf and West India and its subsidiaries and reorganized them as the Florida Transit Company. The following year, Reed acquired the JP&amp;M along with its subsidiary, the Florida Central, both of which he combined together as the Florida Central and Western Railroad. In 1883, Reed reorganized the Florida Transit Company as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. Then, in 1884, Reed brought both the Florida Central and Western and the Florida Transit and Peninsular under the umbrella of a single entity, the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which instantly became the largest railroad in Florida. In 1886, the company was reorganized as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (FC&amp;P).

In late 1892, the FC&amp;P began construction of a new line running north from a junction near Jacksonville to Savannah, Georgia. The FC&amp;P had that same year already leased the South Bound Railroad, which ran north from Savannah to Columbia, South Carolina. Thus, when the FC&amp;P finished construction in late 1893, it had 1,000 miles of rail and a new &quot;air line&quot; extending straight from a connection with the Richmond and Danville Railroad in South Carolina into Jacksonville, resulting in not only a saving of several hours of travel time, but also connecting New York and Tampa.

This direct entrée into Florida did not escape the notice of John Skelton Williams and his financial backers. In April 1899, only two months after assuming formal control of the various railroads in the Seaboard system, the Williams syndicate purchased a majority stock interest in the FC&amp;P for $3.5 million.

===Early 20th century===
On April 14, 1900, the Seaboard Air Line Railway was incorporated, comprising 19 railroads in which it owned all or most of the capital stock. Williams was the first president of the new corporation, which advertised its north–south route as the &quot;Florida-West India Short Line.&quot; James H. Dooley, veteran of several rail mergers in the South, helped organize the SAL and served as chairman of SAL&#x27;s executive council.

On June 3, 1900, through service from New York to Tampa, Florida, was inaugurated, with trains operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad from New York to Washington, D.C.; by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad from Washington to Richmond; and by the Seaboard from Richmond to Tampa, an arrangement that lasted until the creation of Amtrak in 1971. On July 1, 1900, the Seaboard formally assumed operation of the Georgia and Alabama, the FC&amp;P and the Atlantic, Suwannee River and Gulf railroads. In 1903, the FC&amp;P, which had been controlled through stock ownership and operated separately under a lease agreement, was formally consolidated within the Seaboard.

In 1904, Seaboard subsidiary Atlanta and Birmingham Air Line Railway, purchased the previous year, completed construction and extended the Atlanta route to Birmingham, Alabama, the largest center of iron and steel production in the South, and a valuable endpoint for the Seaboard.

Upon formation, the Seaboard inherited multiple repair shop sites from predecessor railroads, most of which were obsolete. A fire at the Portsmouth, Virginia shops in 1903 resulted in the plant being upgraded and modernized. To serve the southern section of the system, new shops were built on the west side of Jacksonville, Florida in 1907, which became the primary diesel shops after 1948. Rather than build any other heavy back shops, the Seaboard chose to equip several major roundhouse terminals to handle medium repairs in addition to the usual &quot;running&quot; repairs on locomotives.

Unfortunately, the new 2,600-mile railroad did not prosper as expected in its early years. Thomas Fortune Ryan, who had opposed the Williams syndicate when it purchased the controlling interests in the various Seaboard companies, succeeded in assuming control of the railroad in 1904. Ryan&#x27;s policies, however, proved disastrous for the Seaboard&#x27;s finances. Following the Panic of 1907, the railroad went into receivership and Ryan was ousted. S. Davies Warfield, a Seaboard director and member of the railroad&#x27;s executive committee, who had assisted Williams in forming the corporation, was appointed one of the receivers, and was subsequently named chairman. In 1912, Warfield — who was the uncle of the Baltimore-born Wallis Warfield Simpson, the future Duchess of Windsor – became the majority stock owner of the Seaboard. By 1915, the railroad had recovered. However, along with most other U.S. railroads, the Seaboard was nationalized during the railroad crisis brought on by World War I and was run by the United States Railroad Administration from December 28, 1917, to March 1, 1920.

====Warfield and the South Florida expansion====
 
With an influx of tourists traveling to rapidly developing Florida, the Seaboard enjoyed a prosperous decade in the 1920s. In 1924, Warfield, now president and CEO of the railroad, began building a 204-mile extension, called the Florida Western and Northern Railroad, from the Seaboard mainline in Coleman, Florida south to West Palm Beach, which for almost thirty years had been the exclusive domain of the Florida East Coast Railway. Some 35 miles northwest of West Palm Beach, the extension ran through Indiantown, which Warfield planned to make the new southern headquarters of the Seaboard. The extension was constructed in record time, and opened in January 1925.

Later in 1925, Warfield constructed the Gross-Callahan Cutoff, which allowed time-sensitive trains to bypass congested Jacksonville, and built the Valrico Cutoff, which provided a direct route from Tampa to West Palm Beach. Warfield also leased the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, which ran from central Florida to Boca Grande, as well as the East and West Coast Railway between Arcadia and Manatee County.

Warfield, however, was not content with what seemed to be a complete Seaboard system in Florida, and at the end of 1925, announced two new extensions, one from West Palm Beach to Miami and another from Arcadia to Fort Myers and Naples. Groundbreaking for the Miami extension took place in Hialeah in January 1926, and by December 1926, the line was open for freight. From January 7 though January 9, 1927, Warfield took a large faction of dignitaries on a special run of the luxurious &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, beginning at Arcadia and proceeding south to Naples, then doubling back over to the east coast and proceeding south from West Palm Beach to Miami.

Warfield had the West Palm Beach architectural firm of Harvey &amp; Clarke, led by Gustav Maass, design a series of now historic Mediterranean Revival stations in West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, Deerfield Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Hialeah, as well as in Naples and Fort Myers. In April 1927, Warfield completed a push of the Miami extension even further south to Homestead, and had his architects erect a Mediterranean Revival station there as well.

====The Great Depression and World War II====

Warfield died in October 1927 and was succeeded by Legh R. Powell, who had worked his way up on the financial side of the railroad. The railroad was in an unfortunate position due to being geographically sandwiched in the South between two well-to-do rivals, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) and the Southern Railway. In addition, Warfield&#x27;s expansion down the west coast of Florida was seen as an unnecessary extravagance due to the presence of the ACL in the same area. In December 1930, the Seaboard again entered bankruptcy following the collapse of the Florida land boom and the onset of the Great Depression. The United States District Court in Norfolk, Virginia—which would oversee the railroad for the next 14½ years—appointed Powell as a receiver.

With loans obtained from the federal government&#x27;s Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the railroad set about modernizing its equipment with new steam freight locomotives and new and rebuilt passenger cars. In 1942, to cut expenses, the SAL abandoned a 27-mile section of its then only 15-year-old Fort Myers-Naples extension between South Fort Myers and Naples, along with sections of two other little-used branch lines from the extension. By aggressive marketing and technological innovations that drew travelers to the line, such as the highly popular &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; streamliner, introduced in 1939, Seaboard managed to regain its financial footing. The economic boom of World War II also helped replenish the railroad&#x27;s coffers. In 1944, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; alone turned a profit of over $8 million, nearly as much as the deficit of the whole railroad had been in the Depression year of 1933.

In May 1945, all of the Seaboard properties were sold under foreclosure at an auction sale to bondholders for $52 million. In 1946, the railroad was reorganized as the Seaboard Air Line &quot;Railroad&quot;.

===Later 20th century===
Quick to recognize the cost savings of diesel power over steam in the postwar period, the Seaboard dieselized all of its mainline trains by 1953. In the same decade, the railroad installed CTC signaling across most of its system, generating further savings of time and money, as well as improved safety. However, like all American railroads, Seaboard saw a decline in revenues, especially in passenger traffic, from the 1950s into the 1960s, in the face of growing competition from airlines, trucking companies and the Interstate Highway System. In 1960 SAL reported 9910 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 484 million passenger-miles, not including Gainesville Midland and Tavares &amp; Gulf.

As a strategic move to reduce costs and counter the competition of airlines and trucking companies, merger with the parallel system of Seaboard&#x27;s chief rival, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) was first proposed in 1958, but was not approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission until 1967. On July 1 of that year, SAL and ACL merged to form Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). The seeming redundancy of the name stems from combining the most common short forms of the two railroads&#x27; names: the public and the railroads themselves for many years had referred to SAL as &quot;Seaboard&quot; and ACL as &quot;Coast Line.&quot;

On May 1, 1971, SCL turned over all its passenger operations to the newly formed Amtrak, which continued to operate the profitable &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; alongside a former Coast Line streamliner, the &quot;Champion&quot;, while eliminating others.

By 1972, Seaboard Coast Line and its corporate relatives Louisville and Nashville, Georgia Railroad, Atlanta and West Point Railroad, Western Railway of Alabama and Clinchfield Railroad began advertising themselves as the Family Lines System, and applying the Family Lines logo to their rolling stock. However, the Family Lines name was merely a marketing strategy, and all the railroads remained separate legal and operating entities.

The Family Lines System and the Chessie System became subsidiaries of the newly created CSX Corporation on November 1, 1980, but continued to operate as separate railroads. The Family Lines name and logo were dropped when all of the Family Lines merged on December 29, 1982, to form the Seaboard System.

On July 1, 1986, the Seaboard System&#x27;s name was changed to CSX Transportation. Subsequently, the Chessie System was merged into CSX Transportation on August 31, 1987.

==Steamship operations==
The &quot;Old Bay Line,&quot; as the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was commonly known, operated steamships between Norfolk, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland, carrying mail and freight as well as passengers and vehicles on the overnight run.

The Seaboard and Roanoke acquired a controlling interest in the steamship company in 1851, providing valuable northward connections from the docks at Norfolk for the railroad&#x27;s passenger and freight business. Control passed to the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in 1901, but in 1922, with S. Davies Warfield as its president, the Old Bay Line became a wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL. In that same year, Warfield was named president of the Seaboard as well.

In 1941, the Chesapeake Steamship Company, jointly owned by the Atlantic Coast Line and the Southern, was merged into the Old Bay Line. Due to the decline of business with the rise of interstate highways and air travel, the steamship company was liquidated in 1962.

==Passenger trains==

 The SAL had a cooperative relationship with the Southern Railway for traffic to the western part of the upper South and the Midwest. For example, the Southern&#x27;s timetables listed SAL routes for train destinations south of Jacksonville Union Station, the gateway hub for trains from the Midwest and the Northeast to Florida destinations, examples being the Southern&#x27;s &quot;Kansas City-Florida Special,&quot; &quot;Ponce de Leon&quot; and &quot;Royal Palm.&quot; Additionally, the Southern and the SAL railroads pooled their operations for the &quot;Florida Sunbeam,&quot; a wintertime train from Detroit and Cleveland to Florida.

Following is a partial list of the many named passenger trains that Seaboard operated during the first half of the 20th century, some of which were continued by successors Seaboard Coast Line (SCL) and Amtrak. Trains originating in New York were handled by the Pennsylvania Railroad from New York to Washington; by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad from Washington to Richmond; and by Seaboard from Richmond to points south.

Prior to the completion of Seaboard&#x27;s Cross-Florida extension from Coleman to West Palm Beach (1925) and on to Miami (1926), the Florida East Coast Railway handled SAL trains from Jacksonville to Miami. Thereafter, Seaboard split most major southbound trains at Wildwood, just north of Coleman, with one section going to Tampa and west coast points, and the other going to Miami. Northbound, the process was reversed, with west and east coast sections joining at Wildwood to continue their journey.

===Heavyweight trains===
The term &quot;heavyweight&quot; refers to trains consisting of passenger cars with all-steel construction, considered a great improvement in safety over the all-wooden or wood-and-steel cars of the 19th century. By 1910, nearly all major railroads were replacing their wooden passenger fleets with cars of heavyweight construction.

&quot;Note: The history of train names on various Seaboard routes is complex, with some being temporarily replaced or discontinued for a year or two, then brought back, perhaps on a somewhat different routing (e.g., to both coasts of Florida or to only one); the following is merely a rough guide to the names of some of the major year-round trains Seaboard offered. Consult sources listed at the end of this article for exact details.&quot;

&quot;Before the Cross-Florida Extension from Coleman to West Palm Beach was completed in 1925 (and extended to Miami in 1927), Seaboard trains for cities on the Atlantic side of Florida were handled by the Florida East Coast Railway south of Jacksonville.&quot;

====Pre World War II====
*Florida and Metropolitan Limited, inaugurated January 14, 1901
::Heavyweight winter-season only (December – April), all-Pullman, New York to both coasts of Florida; on January 1, 1903, renamed the Seaboard Florida Limited in winter (all first-class cars) and Seaboard Florida Express in summer; in 1930, replaced by the New York-Florida Limited, carrying coaches and Pullmans; on December 12, 1941, it was renamed the Palmland.
*Atlanta Special, inaugurated 1901
::Heavyweight coaches and Pullmans. Originally a connecting train from the main-line junction of Hamlet, North Carolina, to Atlanta, in the early 1920s it began operating as a through service from Washington to Birmingham. It was renamed the Seaboard Express on April 12, 1903, later the Atlanta-Birmingham Special in 1911. With the addition of air-conditioned cars on April 28, 1935, it was renamed the Robert E. Lee and on May 18, 1947, the Cotton Blossom.

*Suwanee River Special, inaugurated November 8, 1921
::Heavyweight coaches and Pullmans. This train carried passengers from Cincinnati and other Midwest points to the Gulf Coast resort cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, Venice, and Naples. Handled by Southern Railway (U.S.) from Cincinnati via Atlanta to a connection with the Seaboard at Hampton, Florida. North of Cincinnati, Pullmans handled by other railroads provided through sleeping-car service to and from Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland.
*New Orleans-Florida Limited, November 1924 – July 1949
::Heavyweight coaches and Pullmans. From 1924 to 1929, this train carried the first and only transcontinental sleeping car in the United States, a Pullman from Jacksonville to Los Angeles via a connection with the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; at New Orleans. Superseded by the streamlined Gulf Wind (see below).
*Cross Florida Day Service, Cross Florida Night Service, 1925-early 1960s 
::began with a 1925 predecessor (&quot;Cross Florida Night Limited&quot;); 1930 – early 1960s St. Petersburg – Miami; day service: bus: St. Petersburg – West Lake Wales, train: West Lake Wales – Miami; night service: coaches: St. Petersburg-Tampa, Tampa-West Lake Wales, West Lake Wales-Miami, sleepers: Tampa-Miami
*Orange Blossom Special, November 21, 1925 – April 26, 1953; due to wartime restrictions, did not run in the years 1942–1945.
::Heavyweight, winter-season only, all-Pullman, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg, and West Palm Beach, later to Miami as well. The most luxurious SAL train of its time, introduced to entice wealthy tourists and businessmen to Florida during the land-boom era, its deluxe features included fresh flowers and fresh fish for the dining car, a library car and observation car, and a club car with a barber and shower bath. The OBS was later immortalized in a very famous fiddle tune of the same name.
*Southern States Special, inaugurated May 5, 1929
::Heavyweight coaches and Pullmans, New York to Florida; renamed the Sun Queen on December 12, 1941; renamed the Camellia on May 18, 1947; renamed Sunland on August 1, 1948.

====Post World War II====
*Cotton Blossom, May 18, 1947 – April 24, 1955
::All-coach, New York – Birmingham via Athens, Georgia and Atlanta. Name dropped on April 24, 1955, though the &quot;Cotton Blossom&#x27;s&quot; numbers and timetable were still used by a &quot;Passenger, Mail &amp; Express&quot; until the late 1968.
*Gulf Wind, July 31, 1949 – April 30, 1971
::Heavyweight coach cars and lightweight Pullman cars, Jacksonville – New Orleans via Tallahassee, Pensacola and Mobile. Handled jointly by SAL and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, with motive power changed at Chattahoochee.
*Palmland, December 12, 1941 – April 30, 1971
::Heavyweight coach cars and lightweight Pullman cars, New York – St.Petersburg/Miami. The route was cut back to Columbia, South Carolina as the southern terminus by Seaboard Coast Line by in 1968, and the train was not continued by Amtrak in 1971.
*Sunland, August 1, 1948 – December 1968
::Coach and Pullman cars, New York – Tampa/Miami. Connections in Washington to New York and Boston. Connections in Washington to New York and Boston. The route was cut back to Jacksonville, Florida as the southern terminus by Seaboard Coast Line in February 1968, and later discontinued in December.

===Streamliners===
Although competing railroads in the South were reluctant to make the capital investments needed to streamline their passenger car fleets, Seaboard led the way in 1939 and soon the other roads began to follow. Two of the routes, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and the &quot;Silver Star,&quot; are still operating today; they are the sole survivors of the once-vast market of long-distance Florida trains. The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, &quot;Silver Star&quot;, and &quot;Silver Comet&quot; constituted Seaboard&#x27;s widely advertised and very popular &quot;Silver Fleet&quot; of streamliners, with lightweight fluted-side stainless steel cars pulled by colorful EMD diesel locomotives.

*Silver Meteor, inaugurated February 2, 1939
::Initially an all-coach train (Pullman sleepers added in 1941), first streamliner to serve Florida, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Trains continued beyond Tampa to Sarasota and Venice. Preserving its reputation as &quot;one of the finest [trains] in the country,&quot; the train retained its round-ended observation cars until Amtrak took over operation in 1971. Still in Amtrak service today with updated equipment. 
*Silver Star, inaugurated December 12, 1947
::Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York to Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. Still in Amtrak service with updated equipment, though currently temporarily discontinued.
*Silver Comet, May 18, 1947 – October 15, 1969
::Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, New York – Birmingham via Athens and Atlanta. The train was cut back to Washington – Atlanta only by January 1969, then to Richmond – Atlanta only by May, and finally discontinued October 15, 1969.
*Tidewater, November 1, 1953 – February 1968
::Streamliner, coach and Pullman cars, Portsmouth, Virginia – Jacksonville, Florida, forwarding cars to the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; at Hamlet, North Carolina. Ferries would transport passengers between Norfolk and Portsmouth. Coach only by 1968.

===Significant firsts===
As the underdog in its competition with the wealthier Atlantic Coast Line, Seaboard often strove to bolster its passenger revenues by offering innovative services. Seaboard was the first Florida railroad to:
*Operate air-conditioned Pullmans (1933);
*Install reclining seats in coaches (1936);
*Dieselize its passenger trains (1938); and
*Offer streamlined trains between New York and Florida (1939).

==Freight trains==
In the mid-20th century Seaboard was one of a few railroads that gave names to its main freight trains. Among these were:

*&quot;Merchandiser&quot;, Richmond to Miami
*&quot;Marketer&quot;, Miami to Richmond and Tampa to Richmond (joined into one train at Baldwin, Florida)
*&quot;Tar Heel&quot;, train #89, Richmond to Bostic, North Carolina
*&quot;The Capital&quot;, train #27, Richmond to Birmingham
*&quot;Iron Master&quot;, Birmingham to Atlanta
*&quot;Alaga&quot;, Montgomery to Savannah
*&quot;Pioneer&quot;, Montgomery to Jacksonville
*&quot;Razorback&quot;, train # 96 &amp; # 95, Charlotte, N.C. to Monroe, N.C. and return.

Seaboard also had a number of fast, high-priority freight trains called &quot;Red Ball&quot; freights between various points on its system.

In 1959 Seaboard inaugurated its high-speed piggyback service. The best of these trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) trains was the &quot;Razorback&quot;, trains TT23 and TT24, running between Kearny, New Jersey on the Pennsylvania Railroad and Hialeah Yard, Miami, covering a distance of over 1,000 miles in less than 30 hours.

==Seaboard Airline Railway Free Traveling Library System==

In the late 1890s, Georgia educator and activist Sarah Harper Heard met with and persuaded the vice president and general manager of Seaboard Air Line Railroad, Everett St.John, to have the company transport books to every railroad stop; these small libraries came to be called &quot;S.A.L. Magundi Clubs&quot;. St.John went on to contact Andrew Carnegie, who donated $1,000 towards the effort. Thus began in 1898 the Seaboard Airline Railway Free Traveling Library System; due to his support, Heard sometimes referred to the program as the &quot;Andrew Carnegie Free Traveling Library&quot;.

Heard also traveled to New York City, where she met with book editors and publishing houses to establish business agreements and request donations, and then back to Georgia via the Eastern seaboard, recruiting librarians across six states along the way. Her overall efforts were so successful that the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot; noted that the donations &quot;enabled [Heard] to send the boxes in all directions. Quantities of books have been given and the rooms at Rose Hill, which were used as a distributing headquarters, are now overcrowded&quot;. By the turn of the century, the Seaboard library system boasted a collection of over 2,500 books and attracted so much support that it was able to donate entire libraries to deserving schools. Heard was named Seaboard&#x27;s Superintendent [of] Traveling Libraries in 1901. By 1910, books were being circulated from Rose Hill to 35 community libraries and 150 school libraries; by 1912, the Seaboard library system comprised 18,000 books and 38,000 magazines. A number of publications came from the United States Department of Agriculture.

In a 1901 special edition titled &quot;Free Traveling Libraries&quot;, Seaboard&#x27;s promotional magazine &quot;S.A.L. Magundi&quot; published an assortment of letters written by notable figures including President William McKinley, the governor of Alabama, Florida governor William Sherman Jennings, Georgia governor Allen D. Candler, North Carolina governor Charles Brantley Aycock, South Carolina governor Miles Benjamin McSweeney, Virginia governor James Hoge Tyler, and Andrew Carnegie.

Heard worked to establish twelve &quot;McKinley libraries&quot; in 1902, dedicated to &quot;the characteristics and high ideals so exemplified in the life and purposes of [President William] McKinley&quot;. The traveling library system won a gold medal award at the 1907 Jamestown Exposition in Virginia.

Heard died in 1919, after which her daughter Susan took over management as head librarian until her death on April 7, 1934; Susan&#x27;s husband James Y. Swift then filled the role.

Seaboard continued to transport books to small towns and libraries in need across the region until 1955, leaving behind new libraries scattered among small communities across the Southeast. The library system never charged fees for late or lost books. Its collection of books was donated to schools across Georgia.

<text>The Weardale Railway is an independently owned British single-track branch line heritage railway between , Witton-le-Wear, Wolsingham, Frosterley and Stanhope. Weardale Railway began services on 23 May 2010, but decided to run special trains rather than a scheduled service for the 2013 season. The line was purchased by the Auckland Project in 2020 with a view to restarting passenger services. In 2021, a bid was submitted to the Restoring Your Railway fund. In October 2021, the Department for Transport allocated funding for the development of a business case.

The railway originally ran from Bishop Auckland to Wearhead in County Durham, North-East England, a distance of , built in the 19th century to carry limestone from Eastgate-in-Weardale, and provide passenger services to Weardale. Passenger services ceased in 1953, leaving only freight services to Eastgate until 1992.

After the quarry&#x27;s owner Lafarge moved to road transport in 1993, the line was threatened with closure by British Rail (BR), and it was taken over by a group of enthusiasts. The Weardale Railway currently runs for between Bishop Auckland and the site of Eastgate-in-Weardale Station, making the line one of the longest preserved standard gauge heritage railways in Great Britain.

==Background==

 gained its first rail link in 1842, when the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR) backed Bishop Auckland and Weardale Railway (BA&amp;WR) gained the powers via an Act of Parliament to build a railway line from the S&amp;DR&#x27;s station at via Bishop Auckland and Witton-le-Wear into Crook, County Durham. The BA&amp;WR initially built a temporary terminus at South Church, which opened on 19 April 1842. After completion of the Shildon tunnel, the BA&amp;WR erected a permanent station on the current site, which opened to freight on 8 November 1843, and passengers on 30 January 1843. All operations were sub-leased as agreed to the S&amp;DR.

In 1844, after the West Durham Railway extended from a junction with the Clarence Railway at to Crook, the S&amp;DR extended the BA&amp;WR from Bishop Auckland along the river valley to Witton-le-Wear, and then into Crook. In 1845, the S&amp;DR came to an agreement with the Derwent Iron Company to sub-lease the southern section of the former Stanhope and Tyne Railway. It extended the line from Crook to and then to Blackhill. That line was opened as the Weardale Extension Railway (WXR).

In July 1845 Parliament passed the Wear Valley Act, which allowed the extension of the BA&amp;WR from a junction at Witton-le-Wear to , and a small branch line across the river to Bishopley. With all works again undertaken by the S&amp;DR, this line opened on 3 August 1847. After these works had been completed, the BA&amp;WR amalgamated with the WXR. All services were operated by the S&amp;DR, which officially took over the new company in January 1857.

In 1862, an Act of Parliament was passed allowing the S&amp;DR-backed Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway to extend the line to , thus allowing trains to transport limestone from the Newlandside Estate on the south side of the town.

The final extension of the Weardale Railway to opened on 21 October 1895. Between Eastgate and Westgate at Cambo Keels, sidings were established to serve the Weardale Iron Company&#x27;s Heights limestone quarry, which is still in operation today.

===Decline and closure===
As elsewhere the UK, rail traffic in the area declined after World War II, with the Wearhead branch the first to lose its passenger trains in 1953. The principal closures came in the 1960s, post the Beeching axe. Services to Barnard Castle via West Auckland ended in 1962, those to Durham in 1964, and to Crook in 1965. That left only the former original S&amp;DR line to line in operation, along with the freight-only branch traffic to Eastgate.

Durham County Council recognised the value of the line to leisure services by 1983 when, with the patronage of botanist and TV presenter David Bellamy, intermittent specials began to serve Stanhope again under the banner of The Heritage Line, because of the S&amp;DR association. This became a scheduled weekend-only summer service, printed in BR public timetables, between 23 May 1988 and 27 September 1992. Etherley, otherwise known as Witton Park Station, was re-opened on 21 August 1991. It has not re-opened under the post 2010 Weardale Railway operation.

In March 1993, Lafarge decided to service the Eastgate cement works by road and end its use of rail. British Rail then announced its intention to close the line due to the loss of revenue. Local authorities sought another use for the line and considered that the only immediate possibility was a steam-hauled tourist service.

==Formation of Weardale Railway Trust==

The Weardale Railway preservation project was founded in 1993, with the intention that a private company should take ownership of the line and start a steam service for tourists on the scenic western section. The operating company was known as the Weardale Railways Ltd, a company limited by guarantee.

The Weardale Railway Trust (WRT) is a voluntary group whose members are supporters of the project. WRT was initially just a supporters&#x27; club but it assumed a more prominent role as Weardale Railways Ltd got into difficulties. In 2006 WRT took a 12.5% minority stake in the ownership of Weardale Railways Ltd.

Large sums of public sector grant finance were obtained or conditionally pledged from various donors including the regional development agency (One NorthEast), Durham County Council and the Wear Valley District Council. The Manpower Services Commission contributed to the wages of paid staff in what had become an area of high unemployment, and this allowed a 40-strong workforce to be recruited, a depot and base of operations to be established at Wolsingham and the station at Stanhope to be restored. Services started in July 2004, initially from Wolsingham to Stanhope but with the intention of extending them along the full length of the remaining line. There were even plans to rebuild the Eastgate to Wearhead section which had been lifted.

Eventually, a community interest company known as Ealing Community Transport agreed to pay £100,000 for a 75% stake in Weardale Railways Ltd and provide management support to the project. Ealing Community Transport also agreed to underwrite any further operating losses incurred by Weardale Railways Ltd. This undertaking was sufficient to allow the creditors of Weardale Railways Ltd to permit the resumption of limited services on the line in August 2006.

==British American Railway Services==

In September 2008, Ealing Community Transport&#x27;s 75% interest in WRC was transferred to British American Railway Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of US private company Iowa Pacific Holdings. Ed Ellis, the spokesman for these firms, visited the Weardale Railway in October 2008, and announced an intention to reopen the line to Bishop Auckland by the end of 2008.

In October 2008, the line&#x27;s paid staff and volunteers undertook the &quot;Brush Blitz&quot; to clear 14 years of vegetation growth from the track between Wolsingham and Bishop Auckland. After two damaged sections of track were repaired, in early 2009 a passenger-carrying Wickham trolley (light rail vehicle) was able to negotiate the line from Wolsingham to within sight of Bishop Auckland station. Ellis also announced plans to build a rail freight terminal at Eastgate for the loading of aggregates from local quarries together with other freight, including mineral, food and agricultural commodities.

On 27 March 2009 the railway&#x27;s website reported that Network Rail had undertaken to re-install missing points and crossings at Bishop Auckland to reconnect the Weardale Line with the national rail network. It was stated that this would be done before 31 July 2009. Network Rail completed the connection in early September 2009. On 29 September 2009, the development of the Eastgate Renewable Energy Village received unanimous outline approval by the County Durham strategic planning committee, thus providing a potential boost to the line&#x27;s future prospects. By 2013 this project appeared stalled.

In December 2009, it was announced that UK Coal was interested in using the line to transport coal from an opencast (open pit) coal mine in the line&#x27;s catchment area and that local quarry owners had been approached about the possibility of shipping aggregates along the line. This was intended to ensure the future of the line as a viable business.

In February 2020, Iowa-Pacific, the parent company of British American Railway Services, announced its intention to sell the line. It was purchased in March 2020 by the Auckland Project, a County Durham charity.

==Operations==

On 25 January 2010, Her Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate travelled on the Weardale line checking bridges, fences and crossings along the 18-mile stretch between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland. Only a few minor works were needed to get the line ready for passenger use, and these were completed in time for a to Stanhope charter train to run. In February 2010, this became the first mainline passenger service to travel the line since the 1980s. It was followed on 27 February by a railtour from Crewe to Stanhope, operated by Spitfire Railtours.

Regular passenger services to Bishop Auckland started on 23 May 2010, but for the 2013 season a scheduled service was not offered, the railway instead offering themed operations, such as Dine and Ride and the Polar Express.
Since 2014, the Railway Trust has operated passenger trains on selected weekdays and weekends for mostly tourist traffic using a Class 122 &quot;Bubble Car&quot;. Initially, this only ran between Wolsingham and Stanhope but, on 27 March 2016, this service was extended to Witton-le-Wear. In April 2018, the Weardale Railway CIC announced that works had commenced to lift a short section of track at Broken Banks (approximately west of Bishop Auckland) to enable the embankment to be repaired after subsidence had made the line unusable for passenger traffic. Once the works were completed it was intended to reinstate the tracks and extend the Stanhope to Witton-le-Wear passenger service back to Bishop Auckland West station. Since July 2018, two of the three daily return services between Stanhope and Witton-le-Wear now continue to Bishop Auckland West station. Services to Bishop Auckland West and Witton-Le- Wear were suspended after the takeover by the Auckland Project in 2020 while they waited for a Licence to Operate and resumed on 22 April 2023

After receiving planning permission to load opencast coal, mined in the Crook area, alterations and arrangements were made to the Weardale Railway Depot at Wolsingham, to receive and transship the coal from road to rail. The first loaded coal train left Wolsingham on 16 June 2011 bound for steel works in Scunthorpe. Later, services were extended to include the power station at Ratcliffe On Soar, near Nottingham. This became a five-train-a-week operation that operated until 2 October 2013, and halted as a result of the financial collapse of UK Coal, following the spoil tip landslip that destroyed the connecting railway at Hatfield Colliery in February 2013, preventing coal shipments, and the underground fire at Daw Mill Colliery the following month which plunged UK Coal into financial crisis.

<text>The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), formerly the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB), owns and administers the dock facilities of the Port of Liverpool, on the River Mersey, England. These include the operation of the enclosed northern dock system that runs from Prince&#x27;s Dock to Seaforth Dock, in the city of Liverpool and the dock facilities built around the Great Float of the Wirral Peninsula, located on the west side of the river.

Peel Ports, the MDHC&#x27;s parent company, owns other maritime facilities in the area, including the Cammell Laird shipyard, Tranmere Oil Terminal and the Manchester Ship Canal.

==History==

Liverpool Common Council&#x27;s Dock Committee was the original port authority.
In 1709, it had been authorised to construct Liverpool&#x27;s first enclosed ship basin, the Old Dock, which was the world&#x27;s first commercial wet dock. 
By 1750, the old Dock Committee was replaced by the Liverpool Dock Trustees.

In order to provide stone for the construction of the expanded dock system, from 1830 the trustees (and later the MDHB) operated large quarries at Creetown, Scotland.

The MDHB took over running of Liverpool&#x27;s docks from the trustees in 1858. The need for Liverpool Corporation to divest its dock interests to a new public body was as a result of pressure from Parliament, dock merchants and some rival port operators.

At one point the MDHB railway totalled 104 miles (166 km) of line, with connections to many other railways. A section of the line ran, unsegregated from other road traffic, along the dock road. Today only the Canada Dock Branch is used.

In 1972, the MDHB was reconstituted as a company to allow it to raise money for new building initiatives and projects, including the new container dock at Seaforth. Four lightvessels in the approaches to the River Mersey were maintained by the MDHB until 1973.

The UK Government had retained a 14% shareholding in MDHC which was sold on 30 March 1998.

The company operated a private lifeboat station that was involved in a number of incidents over the years.

==Management==
The MDHC was accused of &quot;macho management&quot; by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; regarding its treatment of some of its staff in the 1990s, which resulted in the Liverpool dockers&#x27; strike.

On 22 September 2005, the MDHC was acquired by Peel Ports, part of the property and transport group Peel Group, which owns a minority stake in Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

== Facilities ==
Cammell Laird Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula. It exits directly onto the River Mersey.

The dock was built as part of an expansion of the Cammell Laird shipyard at the turn of the 20th century by enclosing what was once Tranmere Pool.

Following the closure of the original Cammell Laird shipyard in 1993, the dock and the four remaining dry docks at the site are owned by the MDHC. All were subsequently leased, firstly to the A&amp;P Group and then to Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders, which officially renamed itself Cammell Laird Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Ltd on 17 November 2008.

<text>Kibworth is an area of the Harborough district of Leicestershire, England, that contains two civil parishes: the villages of Kibworth Beauchamp and Kibworth Harcourt . At the 2011 census, Kibworth Beauchamp had a population of 5,433 and Kibworth Harcourt 990. The villages are roughly divided by the Midland Main Line. Kibworth is close to Foxton Locks, Market Harborough, and Leicester.

==History==

In 1270 Walter de Merton, the founder of Merton College, Oxford, bought a large part of the parish of Kibworth Harcourt from Saer de Harcourt, who had been forced to sell the estate after giving his support to the unsuccessful &quot;Second Barons&#x27; War&quot; led by Simon de Montfort. Much of the parish has remained the property of Merton College, Oxford to the present day. There is a stained-glass window depicting Walter de Merton in the bell tower of the parish church, St Wilfrid&#x27;s, of which the warden and scholars of the college are joint patrons with the Bishop of Leicester. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

A village school was founded in 1709, and endowed by Sir Nathaniel Edwards.

Kibworth Harcourt was the birthplace of the writer/reformer Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743–1825) and her brother John Aikin. Their father, John Aikin (1713–1780), kept a dissenting academy there and served as minister of a nearby Presbyterian chapel. The family moved in 1757 to Warrington.

On 23 July 1825 the ancient tower and spire of St Wilfrid&#x27;s collapsed.

===Michael Wood&#x27;s &quot;Story of England&quot;===
In September 2010, Kibworth was the central feature of &quot;Michael Wood&#x27;s Story of England&quot;, a documentary aired on both BBC Four, BBC Two, and repeated on the UKTV channel Yesterday, and PBS America, presented by Michael Wood about the history of England framed through Kibworth.

A book of the same name was published by Viking. The series was likened to &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; for a whole community. Villagers (Kibworth Improvement Team - KiT) have created a new website and successfully requested a grant of £48,200 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to continue the legacy of the TV series by creating a Kibworth Guide Booklet (heritage trails for Kibworth Harcourt, Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton Westerby), several interpretation panels around the three villages, ongoing study materials for the three tiers of local schools, and an Archive (Virtual Museum).

==Facilities==
Kibworth has a number of shops including 2 charity shops, a community newspaper (&quot;The Kibworth &amp; District Chronicle&quot;), and since 2002 new shops, including a branch of the Co-Op. New housing continues to be built on the edge of the village, causing periodic controversy.

The Bookshop, which opened in the High Street in 2009, won a regional award for Independent Bookseller of The Year in 2012.

Kibworth is home to a secondary school named Kibworth Mead Academy.

On the 8th of September 2024, a new skatepark was opened in Kibworth after being constructed over the course of the year. The skatepark joined a recently opened zipwire as one of the latest public leisure facilities in Kibworth.

===Transport===
Arriva Midlands operates Sapphire route X3 between Leicester and Market Harborough and Stagecoach Midlands route X7 between Leicester and Northampton, both via the village. The Midland Main Line runs through the area, but Kibworth railway station, which served both villages, closed in 1968.

==Sport and Leisure==
===Cricket===
It&#x27;s not clear when Kibworth Cricket Club was founded, but evidence of cricket being played in the villages dates back to 1846. The club moved to their new ground in 2006. Kibworth CC has a significant success record, with 13 County championship titles to their name and two ECB National Club Cricket Championship wins, in 2004 and 2008. Kibworth field four senior teams in the Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket League (a designated ECB Premier League) and a Women&#x27;s team in the East Midlands Women&#x27;s Cricket League. They also have an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Leicestershire Youth League.

===Football===
The association football club, previously known as Kibworth and Smeeton, was renamed in 2018 as Kibworth Town, merging the younger and senior teams together.

===Other clubs===
Kibworth CE Primary School is host to Kibworth Rugby Stars, a children&#x27;s rugby club serving ages 18 months to 6 years.

The village also has clubs for snooker, tennis, golf, bowls and dance.

===Kibworth Harcourt Mill===

The mill, a Grade 2* listed structure, last worked in the 1930s and until 1936 was owned by Merton College, Oxford, then ownership and responsibility was transferred to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). Restoration costing £350,000 was undertaken from 2020 to 2021. With parts dating from &quot;at least 1711&quot;, it is the last surviving post mill in Leicestershire county.

<doc id="1161482" wikidata="Q15995238" url="?curid=1161482" title="KCOM Group">
<text>KCOM Group (formerly known as Kingston Communications and latterly KC) is a UK communications and IT services provider. Its headquarters are in the city of Kingston upon Hull, and it serves local residents and businesses with Internet and telephony services. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange but is now privately owned by Macquarie Group.

For historical reasons, the Hull area has no BT landlines, and the vast majority of residents and most businesses in Hull, Cottingham and Beverley are served only with telecoms services by KCOM.

==History==
On 22 August 1902, Hull Corporation (which later became Hull City Council) was granted a licence under the Telegraph Act 1899 to operate a municipal telephone system in the Kingston upon Hull area, opening its first telephone exchange on 28 November 1904 at the former Trippett Street Baths.

At the time, there were a number of such municipal telephone companies around the UK, all of which – with the exception of the one in Hull – were gradually absorbed into the Post Office Telephone department, which later became British Telecom (BT). Hull&#x27;s bid to renew its licence in 1914 was made conditional on the £192,000 purchase of the National Telephone Company infrastructure in the city. The council gave its approval, securing the future of the country&#x27;s only remaining municipally owned telephone corporation.

The first rotary automatic exchange opened in 1922, and from 1934 Strowger exchanges were installed. Rotary and Strowger exchanges were operated to 1975 and 1988 respectively, and two crossbar exchanges to 1989, when the network became fully digital.

Hull has therefore remained an exception within the UK telephone network, being the only place in the UK not served by BT and is noted for its distinctive cream coloured telephone boxes and innovative services, for example becoming the UK&#x27;s first fully digital network in 1989, using Marconi System X telephone switches (Central Offices or Class 5 switches).

The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999 at 225p per share, with Hull City Council retaining 44.9% of shares. The share price peaked at £15.90 per share during the dot.com boom, and it was for a while in the FTSE 100 Index.

In the early part of the new millennium, the company started to pioneer services such as ADSL, Video on Demand and Digital TV. In February 2006, it announced that it would be ceasing its Video on Demand and Digital TV services (called Kingston Interactive TV – KIT) on 1 April 2006.

In 2007 Hull City Council sold its remaining 30.6% stake in Kingston Communications at about 68p per share. Kingston Communications also changed its name to KCOM Group that year.

In 2014, new Ofcom rules required all providers to offer broadband and phone bundles together, to offer better value to customers. Karoo&#x27;s cheapest bundle was £29.99 per month. On 4 April 2016, KCOM Group PLC moved all of its brand under a single KCOM brand name.

In November 2018 KCOM issued a profit warning, cut dividends and warned debts were 10% higher than the previous year, causing a 36% drop in share price. KCOM was acquired by MEIF 6 Fibre Ltd, a business unit of Macquarie Group, in August 2019 at 120.3p per share.

In September 2022 KCOM announced expansion of their FTTP Network to a further 50,000 premises in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Leading to expansions into Barrow, Barton, Brayton, Bridlington, Brigg, Broughton, Crowle, Driffield, Epworth, Goole, Goxhill, Haxey, Hibaldstow, Hornsea, Howden, Kirton Lindsey, Market Weighton, Messingham, Nafferton, Pocklington, Scotter, Scawby, Selby, Withernsea . This meant they would for the first time be competing directly with BT Openreach providers along with other FTTP Providers also carrying out roll out in the area such as InternetTY.

==Operations==

KCOM provides ADSL, VDSL and fibre to the home (FTTH) broadband internet and telephone service in Hull and surrounding areas. The company only provide broadband services to customers with a KCOM residential telephone line. KCOM formerly provided these services under the Karoo and later KC brands, until it adopted the group name across its entire business in 2016. KCOM also provides business broadband services through its Eclipse Internet subsidiary.

In September 2011, the company began a six-month trial of a 100 Mbit/s service in the East Riding of Yorkshire village of Woodmansey. Around 300 homes were involved in the trial. The trial was part of a plan to roll out increased speeds to more than 15,000 homes across the East Riding of Yorkshire. The service is now available for up to 45,000 properties with a further 60,000, bringing the total fibre network to 105,000 properties by 2017.

KCOM&#x27;s fibre to the premises product, Lightstream, requires a new fibre-optic cable be laid to each premises that is terminated inside the home in an optical network terminal (ONT). A router is then plugged into the ONT to distribute the service throughout the home. As of April 2015, the service offered software limited speeds of up to 250 Mbit/s downstream bandwidth. Due to delivery being FTTH greater speeds are a formality and fuelled by market expectation and not network restriction.

This led to Hull gaining a reputation for being a so-called &quot;digital city&quot;, a reputation which still holds true with Hull being in the top 16 digital clusters in the UK according to Tech City&#x27;s Tech Nation report.

The company has been rolling out FTTH service across its footprint, and expects to have completed the rollout to 97% of the company&#x27;s network by March 2019. The FTTH offering provides 400 Mbit/s service to residential customers and 1 Gbit/s service to business customers, with the remaining 4% of customers able to receive 75 Mbit/s VDSL2 service.

In October 2019, Hull became the first UK city to have full fibre broadband available for all residents.

==Monopoly concerns==

As residents and most businesses in Hull are served only with telecoms services by KCOM, there have been complaints around Internet service provision; KCOM&#x27;s broadband service is the only fixed-line residential broadband operator in the Hull area. According to a decision from the European Commission in 2004, KCOM Group held a 100% market share in the wholesale market of broadband services in the Hull area.

In December 2005, Giacom, the owner of Hull24 – a rival broadband provider in the Hull area – complained to Ofcom regarding the provision of network access to KC&#x27;s rivals. The complaint was that &quot;Giacom alleges that Kingston is not providing [network] access on reasonable terms as Kingston&#x27;s pricing is anti-competitive and prohibitive to service providers [other than KC]&quot;. In April 2006 Giacom and KC resumed negotiations on a deal to allow Hull24 to use KC&#x27;s network; as a result Giacom withdrew its complaint and Ofcom closed the case.

In August 2007 the alleged-monopoly of KC was referred to the European Commission by Diana Wallis, MEP for Yorkshire and Humber area.

In May 2008 the &quot;Review of the wholesale broadband access markets&quot; report published by Ofcom determined that KC was &quot;not&quot; acting in a way that would keep out rival companies, and that pricing for wholesale broadband and access to local-loop unbundling was within the market range. The main reason cited by rivals for not providing services in the Hull area was rather one of overall cost-effectiveness, given the relatively small number of potential customers (190,000 homes), and the fact that many of these would be likely to remain with the incumbent supplier.

In July 2009, Nexus Telecoms signed an agreement with KC enabling them to offer effective wholesale line rental and call tariffs to business consumers within the Hull area so giving them a choice of service provider. As Nexus only provide broadband service to businesses, several other providers offering wireless Internet access via WIMAX links have set up and have taken some of KC&#x27;s customers including Pure Broadband and Connexin, both local independent companies.

In September and October 2023, KCOM were embroiled in controversy when rivals started to erect wooden telegraph poles to carry their services into residential neighbourhoods, causing residents&#x27; protests. Local planning consent was not required under &quot;permitted development rights&quot;. 

Reporting on MP Emma Hardy&#x27;s approach to Sir John Whittingdale, the minister for data and digital infrastructure, the BBC confirmed that &quot;Under Ofcom rules, KCOM – as the area&#x27;s dominant telecom provider – is required to share its infrastructure&quot;. Rival MS3 Networks commented that KCOM had historically failed to respond in a timely manner to requests to share their existing underground infrastructure. Communications provider Connexin (communications) had some local facilities, but had requested Ofcom to provide &quot;clarity on pricing and access&quot; to KCOM&#x27;s infrastructure.

In early 2024, after intervention by Graham Stuart MP conferencing Connexin with local politicians from Beverley, East Riding, Connexin started formal complaints with Ofcom against KCOM for failing to allow sharing of KCOM&#x27;S underground cabling infrastructure, causing Connexin to erect their own above-ground network.

==Sponsorships==
From 2002 to 2021 KCOM held the naming rights to the MKM Stadium, which hosts games played by Hull City A.F.C. and the Hull F.C. rugby league team. The stadium is owned by Hull City Council.

From 2014 to 2019 KCOM also held the naming rights to Craven Park, where the Hull Kingston Rovers rugby league team play their games.

<doc id="1161484" wikidata="Q7726628" url="?curid=1161484" title="The Cold Crush Brothers">
<text>The Cold Crush Brothers are an American hip hop group that formed in 1978 in the Bronx, New York City. They were especially known for their memorable routines which included harmonies, melodies and stage-stomping performances. The Cold Crush Brothers still perform in the United States as of 2023. .

==History==
===Formation and early years (1978–1981)===
The Cold Crush brothers formed as a group in 1978. DJ Tony Tone was originally a member of The Brothers Disco featuring DJ Breakout, DJ Baron and the original Funky Four emcees featuring the first female emcee Sha-Rock, KK Rockwell, Keith Keith and Rahiem (who later joined Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five). DJ Charlie Chase was first the DJ for the Furious Five for a very short time in 1979 after the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash had disputes and Flash disbanded from the Furious Five. Then in 1978 DJ Tony Tone joined forces with DJ Charlie Chase and Easy AD left his partner Donald D (of Ice-T&#x27;s group Rhyme Syndicate ) and they disbanded breaking up the duo they called The Asalaam Brothers and joined the Cold Crush Brothers.

The original lineup consisted of the founder, The Original DJ Tony Tone, Supreme Easy A.D., DJ Charlie Chase, Whipper Whip, Mr. Tee, and Dot-A-Rock. Eventually, Whipper Whip and Dot-A-Rock would leave the Cold Crush Brothers and join DJ Grandwizard Theodore &amp; the Fantastic Five, which they considered to be a more established group at the time. The Fantastic Five was originally the &quot;L&quot; Brothers, which consisted of DJ Mean Gene, DJ Cordio, DJ Grand Wizard Theodore, MC Smiley, Master Rob, the Original Kevie Kev and sometimes Busy Bee Starski. Mr Tee also left Cold Crush and Tony Tone, Easy A.D. and Charlie Chase brought in Grandmaster Caz (formerly DJ Casanova Fly), Almighty Kay Gee and J.D.L. to fill the vacancy&#x27;s in the line up. Money Ray would be added to the group in the late &#x27;80s.

The Cold Crush Brothers became involved in one of hip hop&#x27;s most historic moments when Joey Robinson, son of Sugar Hill Records founder Sylvia Robinson, happened to hear Big Bank Hank, a part-time club bouncer and former manager of Grandmaster Caz, rapping to a Cold Crush Brothers tape while working at a pizzeria in New Jersey. Robinson informed Hank that he was forming a group called the Sugar Hill Gang and asked if Hank would like to join. Hank accepted, although he was not an MC. Hank then took Grandmaster Caz&#x27;s rhymes and used them as his own with no agreement from Caz. Caz&#x27;s lyrics landed in a song by the Sugar Hill Gang called &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;. The song became a huge hit in 1979 and was the first hip hop single to land on the Top 40 charts. Caz never received any credit or compensation for the rhymes that he contributed.

Because of the attention they began to attract, many groups would try to battle them to gain street credibility and for Hip Hop supremacy. This would lead to a fierce and well known rivalry with The Fantastic Five, culminating in a lyrical battle between the groups on July 3, 1981. The grand prize was $1000 cash. The Fantastic Romantic (as they later came to be known due to popularity with female audiences) Five won the battle but, as said by Grandmaster Caz, the Cold Crush Brothers &quot;won the war&quot;. After tapes of their battle began to circulate in the street, the people clearly thought that the Cold Crush Brothers won the battle. This established the Cold Crush Brothers as one of the strongest underground Hip Hop crews of all time.

===&quot;Wild Style&quot; and mainstream success (1982–1984)===
The Cold Crush Brothers toured all five boroughs of New York City and as far as Boston before commercially releasing records. Their popularity was strengthened by the sales of their live performances that were recorded on cassette by Tape Master (Elvis Moreno). The Cold Crush Brothers live performances/shows were taped and distributed worldwide via word-of-mouth promotion and mailed out to people everywhere including men and women serving in the armed forces around the world. The Cold Crush Brothers were featured in the 1982 movie &quot;Wild Style&quot;, the seminal work depicting Hip Hop Culture. In the movie, the Cold Crush Brothers featured in a number of scenes, the most notable being the Cold Crush Brothers&#x27; face off against their nemesis, the Fantastic Five in the classic basketball court scene. The other scene was the Battle at the Dixie Club where the brothers flex their emceeing / rap muscle, once again showing their prowess in the hip hop/rap genre. A year after the movie was released, the Cold Crush Brothers took hip hop abroad with tour dates in Japan and Europe.

The Cold Crush Brothers began to release records commercially. The first single was &quot;Weekend&quot; on Elite Records and was released in the fall of 1982. It was a party and dance record that related to everyday working people and what families go through Monday–Friday. The Cold Crush four MCs would say in harmony the days of the week and then each one would take one day describe that weekday and what could happen; &quot;Monday the train was late you hardly eat and you wished you stay in bed&quot;, the recording described ways to have fun on the weekends.

Another memorable moment of contribution of The Cold Crush Brothers was that they started the earliest foreign markets. The Cold Crush Brothers took 25 MCs, DJs, breakers, and bombers to Tokyo, Japan in 1983. This was one of the earliest foreign markets for hip hop other than La Belle, France. Although they had linguistic and cultural barriers, the Wild Style tour was a big success. Right after this, the Cold Crush Brothers were able to gain a CBS records, through the Tuff City Label. They were the first crew to do so, this was the first time in hip hop History that an independent hip hop record label and a major record company like CBS worked together.

Their second single, released in the fall of 1983, was &quot;Punk Rock Rap&quot; on Epic Records licensed by UK CBS Associated records overseas and in the United States on Tuff City Records and distributed by CBS Records. &quot;Punk Rock Rap&quot; was the first hip hop recording to fuse hip hop and rock and break the color barrier in hip hop. The recording introduced the sound of hip hop and rock to white youth in America and around the world. The Cold Crush Brothers &quot;Punk Rock Rap&quot; was so widely popular that at the time, up and coming hip hop artist Doug E. Fresh sampled the phrase, &quot;Oh My God!&quot; for his now classic hip hop classic single, &quot;The Show&quot;, released in 1985.

The Cold Crush Brothers most successful Cold Crush single to date is &quot;Fresh, Wild, Fly &amp; Bold&quot;, released in 1984, which sold 16,000 units in its first week of release; a big deal in the early &#x27;80s. A distribution dispute between Tuff City Records and Profile Records hindered the sales of the single with the most potential of reaching gold status.

In the spirit of spreading Hip Hop culture globally The Cold Crush Brothers were early and integral members of the worldwide Hip Hop organization called Ill Crew Universal.

==Legacy==
Rapper Jay-Z&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot; uses the Cold Crush Brothers as an example of the music industry&#x27;s exploitation of artists: &quot;Industry shady; it need to be taken over / Label owners hate me; I&#x27;m raisin&#x27; the status quo up / I&#x27;m overchargin&#x27; niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush / Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoe&#x27;d us.&quot;

Money Ray died on October 3, 2002.

In 2008, &quot;At the Dixie&quot; from Wild Style was ranked at number 77 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.

On September 24, 2016, DJ Tony Crush, of the Cold Crush Brothers, was inducted into the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture. September 24, 2016 was the day the museum opened.

<text>Kamelot is an American power metal band from Tampa, Florida, formed by Thomas Youngblood in 1987. The Norwegian vocalist Roy Khan joined for the album &quot;Siége Perilous&quot;, and shared songwriting credit with Youngblood until his departure in April 2011. On June 22, 2012, Youngblood announced on their website that their new vocalist would be the Swedish singer Tommy Karevik, who was first featured on Kamelot&#x27;s album &quot;Silverthorn&quot; as the main vocalist, co-songwriter, and lyricist.

As of 2024, Kamelot had released thirteen studio albums, three live albums, two live DVDs and twenty music videos.

==History==

=== 1987–1997: Early years, &quot;Eternity&quot; and &quot;Dominion&quot; ===

The band was formed in Florida in 1987 by guitarist Thomas Youngblood, with Richard Warner on drums, Rob Beck on vocals and Dirk Van Tilborg on bass and keyboards, as &quot;Camelot&quot;. This name was originally suggested by Youngblood&#x27;s mother, since she loved John F. Kennedy. 

In 1988 they recorded the song &quot;Breaking The Silence&quot;, composed by Youngblood and Warner, for &quot;Tampa Bay&#x27;s Metal Mercenaries: The Invasion&quot;, a cassette-only compilation of various Heavy Metal bands from Tampa Bay produced by Keith &quot;Thumper&quot; Collins (ex-bassist for Savatage).

In 1991 Sean Tibbetts (then using the stage name Sean Christians) joined as bass guitarist, Rob Beck was replaced on vocals by Mark Vanderbilt and Dirk Van Tilborg left the band. The band changed its name to &quot;Kamelot&quot; due to there being a local record store named Camelot, and to set it apart from the Camelot mythos. This line up recorded, in the same year, the band first demo.

In 1992 Glenn Barry replaced Sean Christians on bass guitar and, the following year, the band recorded its second demo. After this, David Pavlicko was recruited as keyboardist; in 1993 the band signed a deal with Noise Records and released its first album, &quot;Eternity&quot; in 1995. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Dominion&quot;, was released in 1997. Later that year after a tour in Europe, founder Richard Warner departed the band and drummer Casey Grillo was brought in. 

=== 1998–2006: From &quot;Siége Perilous&quot; to &quot;The Black Halo&quot; ===
In 1998 Mark Vanderbilt was unable to tour and Roy Khan (of Conception) was recruited as the new lead vocalist. When Roy Khan was selected, he had to prove himself by skydiving with the band. With these two new members, Kamelot released its third studio album, &quot;Siége Perilous&quot;. The band undertook its first tour later that year, playing shows across Europe.

Following their first European tour and the departure of keyboardist Pavlicko, the band returned to Tampa to write music for a new album titled &quot;The Fourth Legacy&quot;, released in 1999. In mid-2000, Kamelot undertook the &quot;New Allegiance Tour&quot; through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spain, during which the recordings for Kamelot&#x27;s first live album &quot;The Expedition&quot; were made. A few months later, the band released its fifth album, &quot;Karma&quot;.

The sixth album, &quot;Epica&quot;, was released in 2003. Both &quot;Epica&quot; and the band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;The Black Halo&quot;, which was released in 2005, are based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s version of the legend of &quot;Faust&quot;, a man who sells his soul to the devil. To support the new album, the band toured through Europe (with At Vance as a supporting band) and Japan. During the first leg of the &quot;Black Halo World Tour 2005&quot;, Kamelot played a headliner show with Epica and Kotipelto. In Japan, the supporting group was Silent Force. The band also played at the Bang Your Head!!! Festival in Germany and the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium.

In 2005, Kamelot made its first music videos for the songs &quot;The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)&quot; and &quot;March of Mephisto&quot; from the album &quot;The Black Halo&quot;. Both videos were shot by the prolific director Patric Ullaeus. On October 5, 2005, Kamelot added Oliver Palotai as the fifth official band member; Palotai played both keyboards and (additional) guitars. On the second leg of the Black Halo World Tour, Kamelot visited North America (Canada and the United States), South America (Brazil), and Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden). On February 11, 2006, the band&#x27;s live DVD, &quot;One Cold Winter&#x27;s Night&quot; was filmed by Patric Ullaeus at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, Norway. It was released on November 17, 2006, in Germany, on November 20 in other parts of Europe, and on November 21 in the US and Canada via SPV Records.

=== 2007–2011: &quot;Ghost Opera&quot;, &quot;Poetry for the Poisoned&quot; and Khan&#x27;s departure ===

In late 2006 the band returned to Gate Studios in Wolfsburg, Germany, to record the album &quot;Ghost Opera&quot;, which was released on June 1, 2007 in Germany, on June 4 in the rest of Europe, and on June 5 in the US. The album was recorded and mixed at Gate Studios and Pathway Studios in Wolfsburg with the producers Sascha Paeth and Miro. Music videos were made for the songs &quot;Ghost Opera&quot;, &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, &quot;Rule the World&quot; and &quot;Love You to Death&quot;. A re-issue of &quot;Ghost Opera&quot;, labeled &quot;Ghost Opera: the Second Coming&quot;, was released shortly after its predecessor. It contains the entire original &quot;Ghost Opera&quot; album and a second CD with ten songs recorded during a concert in Belgrade, Serbia, with the additional bonus tracks &quot;Season&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;The Pendulous Fall&quot;, &quot;Epilogue&quot; and &quot;Rule the World (Remixed)&quot;. The World Tour 2008-2009 for &quot;Ghost Opera&quot; included three legs in Europe and one US Tour, support bands were Edguy, Firewind, Leaves&#x27; Eyes, Delain and Serenity. During the summers of 2008 and 2009, they played festivals like Wacken Open Air, Rock am Ring, Sonisphere Festival and Metal Rock Fest in Lillehammer. At the TT Circuit Assen they played as support with Within Temptation for Iron Maiden.

In December 2009 Youngblood announced that the bass guitarist Glenn Barry had officially left the band and had been replaced by the touring bass guitarist and former member, Sean Tibbetts. In January 2010, Kamelot started working on their ninth studio album, in a cabin in Norway. It was said that the band was exploring &quot;new sounds&quot; and that the topics on the new album would be diverse. During early 2010, Kamelot published the titles of three songs from the upcoming album on their official website: &quot;The Great Pandemonium&quot;, &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Season&quot; and &quot;Thespian Drama&quot;. They also revealed that guest musicians would appear: Simone Simons (she provided vocals for the ballad &quot;House on a Hill&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track), and later Gus G, of the Greek power metal band Firewind.

On March 25, 2010 they began the &quot;Pandemonium over Europe&quot; tour, which ended on April 26, 2010. Afterward, the band revealed that the title of their ninth studio album as &quot;Poetry for the Poisoned&quot;. It was released by earMUSIC (the international label of the entertainment group Edel) in Europe on September 10, 2010, and by the band&#x27;s own label KMG Recordings (via Knife Fight Media and Dismanic Distribution) in North America on September 14, 2010. A music video for &quot;The Great Pandemonium&quot; was directed by Owe Lingvall and was released on September 1, 2010. &quot;Poetry for the Poisoned&quot; entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts at number 74, selling 6,100 copies in its first week. During the summer of 2010 they played a festival summer tour which included festivals like Wacken Open Air, Rock am Ring, Tuska Open Air Festival, ARTmaИ!a. The last festival of the tour was Sziget Festival on August 14.

On September 6, 2010 the band announced that Khan had fallen seriously ill during rehearsals for the upcoming North American tour, just a few days before its scheduled start, and had returned to Norway. While it was initially reported that the band would continue the tour with the Norwegian vocalist Michael Eriksen of Circus Maximus in Khan&#x27;s place, the band later announced that it would postpone the tour with Khan, though one show was performed with Eriksen at the ProgPower USA XI festival in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 10, 2010. However, on December 16, due to Khan&#x27;s lingering illness, it was announced that Fabio Lione of Rhapsody of Fire would replace Khan for the remaining and rescheduled dates on the Pandemonium over Latin America, Europe and North America tours in 2011, and later the 70,000 Tons of Metal Cruise in 2012. Other guest singers appeared on selected shows, such as Simone Simons singing The Haunting and Don&#x27;t You Cry, Tommy Karevik singing Center of the Universe, EdenEcho and The Human Stain, Shagrath as Mephisto on March of Mephisto and Memento Mori, Alissa White-Gluz also as Mephisto on March of Mephisto and Atle Pettersen on Karma. On April 15, 2011, the band released &quot;Poetry for the Poisoned &amp; Live from Wacken – Limited Tour Edition&quot;, containing the audio from Khan&#x27;s last recorded show with the band.

=== 2012–2014: Arrival of Karevik and &quot;Silverthorn&quot; ===

Following a period of uncertainty, Khan and Kamelot released separate statements on April 21 and 22 respectively, announcing Khan&#x27;s departure from the band. According to Youngblood, the band was already searching for a new singer, with the deadline for submissions at the end of January. On June 22, Kamelot introduced Tommy Karevik as their new official vocalist. Karevik had previously appeared as one of the guest singers on the 2011 Pandemonium World Tour. Their first show with Karevik was on July 12, 2012 at Masters of Rock.

Kamelot returned to the German label SPV GmbH to release their tenth record (their first with Karevik), which was unveiled as &quot;Silverthorn&quot; in July, along with a release date of October 26, 2012. A music video was released for the first single from Silverthorn, &quot;Sacrimony (Angel Of Afterlife)&quot;. &quot;Silverthorn&quot; was greeted with positive reviews and the band once again charted in the top 100 on the US Billboard Charts at number 79. 

The band joined Nightwish on their Imaginaerum World Tour in North America as special guests during September and October 2012 in the period leading up to the release of Silverthorn, along with guest-vocalists Elize Ryd and Alissa White-Gluz. Following the North American tour Kamelot embarked on a European headlining tour during November 2012, with support on the tour coming from Xandria, Triosphere and Blackguard. The band also toured new countries on &quot;Silverthorn&quot; including Australia, Korea and Taiwan.The band toured during 2013 with the band Delain, and string quartet Eklipse. During this leg of the tour, keyboardist Oliver Palotai sat out while he and girlfriend Simone Simons of the band Epica awaited the birth of their first child. Epica keyboardist Coen Janssen filled in for Palotai. The touring cycle for the album ended with tours in Europe, North America and finally in South America 2014.

In 2014 the band took some time off from touring, to concentrate on working on the next album. They only played two festivals in Europe, Sweden Rock Festival and Masters@Rock Festival and two club shows, one in Trondheim and one in Haarlem. In Haarlem they played a special acoustic set that included the live premiere of &quot;Welcome Home&quot; and the acoustic premiere of &quot;Karma&quot;.

=== 2015–2019&quot;: Haven&quot;, &quot;The Shadow Theory&quot; and line-up changes ===
On February 23, 2015, it was announced that the eleventh Kamelot album would be called &quot;Haven&quot;. It was released on May 5 of that year. Alissa White-Gluz, Troy Donockley, and Charlotte Wessels appear as guests on the album. Three music videos were released for &quot;Haven&quot;: &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;Liar Liar (Wasteland Monarchy)&quot; and &quot;My Therapy&quot;. The album was well received by critics and fans which resulted in entering the US Billboard Charts at number 75 and the Billboard Hard Rock Charts at number 1.

Shortly before the release of the album Kamelot began a new world tour to promote the album which started in North America with DragonForce as special guests. During summer they played at Masters of Rock, Kavarna Rock Fest and Rock by the River Festival. Later in the year the band returned to Europe with Kobra and the Lotus and Gus G as support. Between their shows in Milan and Strasbourg, they headed to Japan over the weekend, to play at Loud Park Festival for the first time. 2015 was concluded with the second leg of the American tour, again with DragonForce. Kamelot&#x27;s focus in 2016 continued on live shows in support of &quot;Haven&quot; and brought them again to Europe, but also toured Japan and South America. In 2016, the band announced that following the end of the third Haven tour and a &quot;couple of more [touring] dates&quot;, they would be working on their new studio album.

February 2, 2017 marked the second time for Kamelot joining the metal cruise 70000 Tons of Metal. The band opened for Iron Maiden and Ghost with Exodus on July 1, 2017 at the San Manuel Amphitheater in San Bernardino.

The DVD/Blu-ray for the live release was later announced on June 3, 2020 with a release date of August 14, 2020.

=== 2020–present: &quot;The Awakening&quot; ===

On February 26, 2020 Kamelot announced that they would release their first book, &quot;Veritas: A Kamelot Legacy&quot;, via Rocket 88, which would include band memorabilia as well as studio, live and personal photos from the band&#x27;s career, marking the thirtieth anniversary of Kamelot&#x27;s founding.

In a June 2020 interview with the &quot;Jones.Show&quot;, Youngblood revealed that he, Karevik and Palotai have been working on new material for their upcoming thirteenth album: 
In two interviews with FaceCulture and A&amp;P Reacts, Youngblood had also revealed that twenty-five songs had been written for the new album, in which they would focus on thirteen of them. Both Youngblood and Karevik had also stated that the band planned to release the new album in August or September 2021, though it originally was set to be released in March. In an October 13, 2020, interview with Gino Alache on the &quot;Rockum Radio Show&quot;, Youngblood confirmed that there were twelve songs for the album and the band were preparing to enter the studio to record their thirteenth studio album. When asked about the album&#x27;s songwriting approach in an interview, Youngblood spoke that the album will contain a mixture of new elements and influences, with material that fans should expect.

There had been no updates to the upcoming album&#x27;s release date since passing the 2021 deadlines, but Kamelot produced two music videos for the album in May 2022. In the following month, the band announced that the &quot;final touches of mixing are underway&quot; for the album, which is planned for an early 2023 release, as well as the announcement that cellist Tina Guo would be a featured guest on the album. In addition to being confirmed as a headliner at the 2023 edition of ProgPower USA, the band supported the album by going on a five-day tour in Brazil with Turilli / Lione Rhapsody in February 2023 with Melissa Bonny as a guest vocalist. On December 9, 2022, the band announced the first European leg for their &quot;Awaken the World Tour&quot; which began in March 2023. A teaser for the thirteenth studio album was released on January 6, 2023.

Simultaneously with the release of the single &quot;One More Flag in the Ground&quot;, on January 12, 2023, the album&#x27;s title was revealed, as &quot;The Awakening&quot;, and it was subsequently released on March 17, 2023. Prior to its release, the band had released three singles to promote the album: &quot;Opus of the Night (Ghost Requiem)&quot;, &quot;Eventide&quot; and &quot;NightSky&quot;.

<text>Six by Seven (also written as SIX.BY SEVEN or six.by seven or six.byseven) are an English indie rock band, formed in 1992 in Nottingham. The classic lineup of the band featured singer/guitarist Chris Olley, guitarist Sam Hempton, drummer Chris Davis, bassist Paul Douglas and keyboard player James Flower. 

The band split up in 2008, before re-forming in 2012 with Olley and Flower as the only original members.

==Formation==
Originally formed in 1992 as &quot;Friends Of...&quot;, they performed their first show at the Old Angel pub in their hometown of Nottingham in late 1992. After recording several demos and playing gigs, the band attracted some record company interest. However, they once played to a room full of A&amp;R men at Leicester&#x27;s Charlotte with the room emptying before the first 15-minute song was complete. Undeterred, the band continued to write and record. Bass player Paul Douglas joined later that year. The band got their break by playing support slots with Rocket from the Crypt and Girls Against Boys, and changed their name to Six by Seven in 1996. The name was taken from the research connected with the Hubble Space Telescope. Sam Hempton came up with the name and described it as follows:

&quot;There was a big debate as to whether the millions of other galaxies in the universe were accelerating away from each other or moving away at a constant rate, or whether they were actually coming back in on themselves. The scientists originally thought that everything would eventually come back in on itself and implode, but what&#x27;s actually happening is that they are accelerating away at a rate of 6 x 7.&quot;

==Early releases==
In 1997 the band released their debut 12-inch single &#x27;European Me&#x27;, which led to a five-album deal. Their debut album, &quot;The Things We Make&quot;, was released the following year, after which they began headlining their own shows, as well as touring with Ash, Manic Street Preachers, The Dandy Warhols, and Placebo. In May 1998, they were asked to play a live session on the &quot;John Peel Show&quot;, and recorded four more sessions over the next four years.

Their second album, &quot;The Closer You Get&quot;, was released in 2000. Sam Hempton left the band shortly thereafter. Douglas followed in 2002, after the release of their third album, &quot;The Way I Feel Today&quot;. In September 2004 the fourth album &quot;04&quot; was released, along with a collection of outtakes from the recording sessions called &quot;Left Luggage at the Peveril Hotel&quot; which was initially available through the band&#x27;s website. In April 2005 a new album was announced for release entitled &quot;Artists Cannibals Poets Thieves&quot; – it was described as Six by Seven&#x27;s &quot;first album as a three-piece&quot;.

==Disbanding==
Shortly before the album&#x27;s release in June, the band announced they were to &quot;stop touring and effectively end the group for the foreseeable future&quot;, with a live album and a b-sides and rarities collection to follow.

In December 2005 a new &quot;unofficial&quot; studio album – &quot;Club Sandwich at the Peveril Hotel&quot; – was released on the band&#x27;s web site on 16 January 2006, with a limited number of copies making their way into stores in March. Although there was mention (and even scheduling) of a series of live gigs for early 2006, these shows were eventually cancelled.

In August 2006 the band made a surprise appearance playing at the Social in Nottingham with a new line-up featuring past collaborators Tony Doggen Foster and Ady Fletcher with Ian Bissett newly recruited on the drums.

In September 2006 a collection of rarities, live tracks and demo recordings was made available via the bands&#x27; website.

On 12 December 2006 the band played another gig at the Social in Nottingham. Once again this featured the lineup of Chris Olley, James Flower, Doggen, Ady Fletcher and Ian Bissett.

==Side projects==
Chris Olley continues to work on solo project Twelve but has laid electro clash outfit Fuck Me USA to rest. He released his first solo album in November 2009 and has released several more since, mostly via his website.

Chris Davis formed Spotlight Kid as a side project with Nottingham-based singer Katty Heath in 2004. When Six by Seven broke up in 2005 Chris decided to carry on full-time with Spotlight Kid. The second album featured Chris (as ringleader, chief songwriter and stickman) and a full band, along with Katty continuing on vocal duties.

==Reformation==
In February 2007, it was officially announced via the band&#x27;s website that Six by Seven had re-formed with their original lineup of Chris Olley, Sam Hempton, James Flower and Christian Davis. Pete Stevenson takes over Paul Douglas&#x27; role on bass.

July 2007 saw the online release of a new album recorded solely by Olley and Flower. It was entitled &quot;If Symptoms Persist, Kill Your Doctor&quot; and was limited to 1000 copies only. Its lyrics are inspired by an episode of a BBC TV programme called The Trap. Gigs were scheduled to coincide with the release.

A best of (with songs chosen by fans on the official forum) was released later including remixes and a DVD containing the band&#x27;s promo videos.

The band finally imploded after Chris Olley left in November 2008.

In August 2012, Chris Olley announced that he and James Flower re-formed Six by Seven and that they were recording new material with the former Placebo drummer Steve Hewitt. A new album, Love And Peace And Sympathy, was released on 8 July 2013.

Following a Facebook campaign to get Eat Junk Become Junk to number one another re-formation happened. After the song went to number one in the Christmas 2015 Rock Download Chart, Beggars Banquet re-released the band&#x27;s second album on vinyl, including a bonus album of B-sides and Peel Sessions. A Greatest Hits CD was also released. Following this the band did two one-off shows with the original line-up at the Maze In Nottingham and The Garage in London. At the Maze show in Nottingham the band played &quot;The Closer You Get&quot; album in its entirety.

With another six by seven show planned in October 2017, Chris Olley intends to re-form and restructure the band as a going live concern once again. The band played the Glade stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2019.

<text>Nirex was a United Kingdom body set up in 1982 by the UK nuclear industry to examine safe, environmental and economic aspects of deep geological disposal of intermediate-level and low-level radioactive waste (LLRW).

==History==
Originally known as the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, it became United Kingdom Nirex Limited in 1985. The ownership of Nirex was transferred from the nuclear industry to the UK Government departments DEFRA and DTI in April 2005, and then to the UK&#x27;s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) in November 2006. Nirex&#x27;s staff and functions were integrated into the NDA in April 2007, at which point Nirex ceased trading as a separate entity. Nirex&#x27;s role continued through the activities of the Radioactive Waste Management Directorate of the NDA, which later became Radioactive Waste Management Ltd (now trading as Nuclear Waste Services).

Nirex had gained widespread notoriety during the 1980s as the focus for widespread public opposition to the burying of nuclear waste in the UK. Nirex was based at Harwell, Oxfordshire and had several roles:

*to advise organisations and companies that produce radioactive waste on how they should package radioactive waste;
*to set standards for radioactive waste packaging. It monitored the processes of organisations and companies to check, for example, that they had procedures for keeping adequate records;
*to produce on behalf of the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs an updated public record of the quantities and types of radioactive waste in the UK;
*to continue to develop understanding of the scientific, technological and environmental options for dealing with radioactive waste, including developing an understanding of the requirements for public acceptability.

Nirex was also involved in keeping the UK abreast of international expertise in research and development into the disposal of radioactive waste.

During the mid-1980s proposals for low-level nuclear waste repositories at Billingham, Elstow, Bradwell, Fulbeck, and South Killingholme were abandoned due to local opposition. In 1989, work began on two possible sites to take both intermediate and low-level waste near Dounreay in Caithness and near Sellafield in Cumbria. Following preliminary investigations at both sites, Nirex announced plans in October 1992 to build a “Rock Characterisation Facility” (RCF) at Sellafield. Nirex critics including Cumbria County Council, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace argued that the RCF was an integral part of Nirex&#x27;s repository plans and in effect a &#x27;trojan horse&#x27; for an intended nuclear waste repository. It was also successfully argued that the RCF proposal was scientifically flawed and that Nirex&#x27;s scientific knowledge was insufficient to prove that disposal was safe for any site. In 1997, following a five-month local planning inquiry, the Secretary of State for the Environment rejected Nirex&#x27;s case. 
The Inquiry Inspector said &quot;chemical containment is new and untried, with more experimentation and modelling development indubitably required. This work would to my mind be particularly difficult and important because of the problems of meaningfully testing some of the components of the concept. Implicitly Nirex feels unable to credit the notion that this barrier would fail; but the lack of any calculation based on an adverse, as distinct from a conservative, interpretation of this chemical containment seems to me to be an unfortunate omission from the emerging safety case, particularly having regard to FOE&#x27;s impressive critique of the concept.&quot;.

<text>Teach For America (TFA) is a nonprofit organization whose stated mission is to &quot;enlist, develop, and mobilize as many as possible of our nation&#x27;s most promising future leaders to grow and strengthen the movement for educational equity and excellence.&quot;

The organization aims to accomplish this by recruiting and selecting college graduates from top universities around the United States to serve as teachers. The selected members, known as &quot;corps members,&quot; commit to teaching for at least two years in a public or private charter K–12 school in one of the 52 low-income communities that the organization serves.

==History==

TFA was founded by Wendy Kopp based on her 1989 Princeton University undergraduate thesis. Members of the founding team include value investor Whitney Tilson, former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Douglas Shulman, and president and CEO of Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) Richard Barth.

Since the first corps was established in 1990, more than 42,000 corps members have completed their commitment to Teach For America. In September 2015, the organization reached a milestone of 50,000 corps members and alumni, who have collectively taught more than 5 million students across the nation.

The first 10 years of the organization are chronicled in Kopp&#x27;s book &quot;One Day, All Children: The Unlikely Triumph of Teach For America and What I Learned Along the Way.&quot;

In January 2011, Wendy Kopp released her second book, &quot;A Chance To Make History&quot;, which outlines what she has learned over the last twenty years working in American education.

== Approach ==
Teach For America recruits recent college graduates and professionals to teach for two years in urban and rural communities throughout the United States. The goal of Teach For America is for its corps members to make both a short-term and long-term impact by leading their students to reach their full potential and becoming lifelong leaders for educational equity. Corps members do not have to be certified teachers, although certified teachers may apply. Uncertified corps members receive alternative certification through coursework taken while completing the program.

All corps members are required to attend an intensive summer training program to prepare for their commitment. Details vary by region, but typically include a five-day regional introduction, a five to seven week residential institute, including teaching summer school, and one to two weeks of regional orientation.

Teach For America teachers are placed in public schools in urban areas such as New York City, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and Houston, as well as in rural places such as eastern North Carolina and the Mississippi Delta. They then serve for two years and are usually placed in schools with other Teach For America corps members.

Teach For America teachers are full-fledged faculty members at their schools, receiving the normal school district salary and benefits as well as a modest AmeriCorps &quot;education voucher&quot; (which can be used to pay for credentialing courses, cover previous student loans or fund further education during or after the two-year commitment). They do not automatically join a union, but are not prohibited from doing so. They may join union strikes even if they are not union members, at the cost of losing pay.

== Retention ==
In 2015, Teach For America reported that 88 percent of its first-year teachers had returned for a second year. The organization also reported that more than 11,000 of its more than 37,000 alumni at the time were still teaching and that further, 65 percent of its alumni were working full-time in the field of education.

Additionally, the organization reported that 84 percent of its alumni were working full-time in roles impacting education or low-income communities. This includes more than 900 school leaders, more than 100 elected union leaders, and 250 school system leaders.

== Geographical reach ==
Teach For America&#x27;s geographical impact has grown significantly since its foundation. Originally serving only six regions, Teach For America was active in 52 regions as of the 2015–16 school year.

The 52 regions are: Alabama, Appalachia, Arkansas, Baltimore, the Bay Area, Buffalo, Capital Valley (the Sacramento area), Charlotte, Chicago-Northwest Indiana, Colorado, Connecticut, Dallas-Ft. Worth, the D.C. Region, Delaware, Detroit, Eastern North Carolina, the Greater Nashville area, the Greater New Orleans-Louisiana Delta area, the Greater Philadelphia area, Hawai&#x27;i, Houston, Idaho, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, the Las Vegas Valley, Los Angeles, Massachusetts, Memphis, the Metro Atlanta area, the Miami-Dade area, Milwaukee, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, the North Carolina Piedmont Triad area, Northeast Ohio (the Cleveland area), Oklahoma, Orlando, Phoenix, Rhode Island, the Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio, San Diego, South Carolina, South Dakota, South Louisiana, Southwest Ohio (the Cincinnati area), St. Louis, the Twin Cities, and Washington state.

For the 2016 application season, five regions were classified as &quot;High Priority Regions,&quot; or regions with an urgent need for corps members. The five regions are: the Las Vegas Valley, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Eastern North Carolina, and Northeast Ohio (the Cleveland area).

==Evaluation==
Since the founding of the organization, several independent studies have been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of Teach For America corps members relative to teachers who entered the teaching profession via other channels.

A 2015 Mathematica Policy Research study found that Teach For America teachers produce 1.3 months of extra reading gains in pre-K through second grade classrooms when compared to non-TFA teachers in the same elementary schools. The same study also found that Teach For America teachers across 10 states are as effective as other teachers in math and reading.

A study by the Calder Center and the American Institutes for Research found that Teach For America teachers provide students in Miami with the equivalent of three additional months of math instruction, based on analyses of test scores from state-mandated tests.

The Harvard Strategic Data Project found in 2012 that Teach For America teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District produce 1-2 extra months of English and math learning outcomes relative to the gains produced by other novice teachers.

Studies in North Carolina and Tennessee suggest that Teach For America is the most effective source of new teachers in the two states, based on student achievement across subjects and grade levels.

In a study by the Urban Institute and the Calder Center in March 2008, published in the &quot;Journal of Public Policy and Management&quot;, the authors found &quot;TFA teachers tend to have a positive effect on high school student test scores relative to non-TFA teachers, including those who are certified in-field. Such effects exceed the impact of additional years of experience and are particularly strong in math and science.&quot;

Another study by Mathematica in 2013 found that students of Teach For America teachers in eight states learn 2.6 more months of secondary math compared with students taught by non-TFA teachers.

A study conducted by Georgia&#x27;s Department of Audits and Accounts in 2015 found that about 85 percent of the students taught by Teach For America beginning teachers met or exceeded the state&#x27;s standards compared to 70-74 percent of those in the classes of traditional certified, rookie teachers. Only 77 percent of veteran teachers saw the same achievement in their students. The study countered the long-held belief that the organization&#x27;s five-week training led to poor student outcomes.

According to an independent study by Policy Studies Associates in 2011, almost 90 percent of principals who work with Teach For America teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with Teach For America and noted that corps members are rated as effective as, and in some cases more effective than, veteran faculty in their schools. Additionally, 87 percent of principals said Teach For America corps members’ training is at least as effective as the training of other beginning teachers, and 53 found corps members’ training to be more effective.

Teach For America won the largest grant of nearly 1,700 applications to the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Investing in Innovation (i3) grant competition in 2010. The 13 scale-up grants required applicants to provide demonstrated evidence of success through objective, methodologically sound studies (e.g., experimental and quasi-experimental research designs) of student achievement.

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that advantaged individuals who teach as part of TFA &quot;adopt beliefs that are closer to those of disadvantaged Americans&quot; as a result of their TFA participation.

==Criticism==
Teach For America has been criticized by opponents who claim the program replaces experienced teachers with brand-new employees who have had only five weeks of training during the summer, and who are brought in at beginners&#x27; salary levels. This criticism applies to the vast majority of new Teach For America teachers, though a small percentage may have some previous experience in education or advanced degrees. Teach for America has responded to critics of its training program by introducing a new program that encourages juniors at undergraduate universities to complete education courses in their senior year before setting foot in the classroom.

Teachers&#x27; unions regularly critique the organization, which they see as undermining the professionalization of the education sector by bringing in temporary amateurs to fill positions traditionally reserved for certified professionals. John Wilson, executive director of the National Education Association, sent a memo in May 2009 stating that union leaders were &quot;beginning to see school systems lay off teachers and then hire Teach For America college grads due to a contract they signed.&quot; Wilson went on to say that Teach For America brings in &quot;the least-prepared and the least-experienced teachers&quot; into low-income schools and makes them &quot;the teacher of record&quot;.

&quot;USA Today&quot; reported that in March 2009, Peter Gorman, the superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina schools told board members that because of a commitment made to the program, 100 Teach For America teachers would be retained in spite of the fact that hundreds of other non-Teach For America teachers in the district would be laid off. However, Teach For America spokeswoman Kerci Marcello Stroud says it would be a mistaken notion to say that Teach For America corps members are displacing experienced teachers. &quot;In every region where we send teachers, we&#x27;re just one source,&quot; she says. &quot;Once they land, corps members must interview for jobs just like everyone else.&quot;

Critics of Teach For America have also cited the results of Mathematica Policy Research&#x27;s 2004 study as an indication of Teach For America&#x27;s lack of efficacy (see Educational Impact). These critics claim that while the study shows that students taught by Teach For America teachers perform better in mathematics than those taught by non-Teach For America teachers, the improvement is very small, and that furthermore there is no difference in reading performance between the two groups.

A 2010 article published by Campus Progress suggested that &quot;TFA’s breakneck training course leaves TFA teachers—or &#x27;corps members,&#x27; as they’re called—with insufficient classroom experience, before throwing them headfirst into some of the most disadvantaged school districts in the country.&quot;

Deborah Appleman, a professor of Educational Studies at Carleton College, wrote in a 2009 editorial for the &quot;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&quot; that &quot;[i]mplicit in Teach for America&#x27;s approach is the insidious assumption that anyone who knows a subject and is willing to be with kids can teach – with little training.&quot; She also challenged TFA&#x27;s &quot;elitist&quot; structure. &quot;The story of TFA becomes a kind of master narrative, a story of heroic and altruistic young people that focuses much more squarely on them than it does on the lives of the children they are committed to serve. There is an elitist overtone to the structure of TFA, a belief that the best and the brightest can make a difference in the lives of children who are less fortunate, even when they are not professionally prepared to do so.&quot;

Kopp said in a Seattle radio appearance in 2001 that outsiders often misunderstand the function of TFA. “We’re a leadership development organization, not a teaching organization,” she said. “I think if you don’t understand that, of course it’s easy to tear the whole thing apart.” Critics claim this comment shows TFA exists more to advance the career of its recruits than of the students it claims to help.

&quot;Teach For America Counter-Narratives: Alumni Speak Up and Speak Out&quot; (Peter Lang, 2015), edited by T. Jameson Brewer and Kathleen deMarrais, was the first official collection of critical alumni voices. Each chapter of the book, written by TFA alumni, sheds light on the organization. With critical narratives covering the entire span of TFA&#x27;s first 25 years of operations, the chapters are organized into three broad categories: (1) TFA&#x27;s Recruitment, Training, and Support Structure; (2) TFA&#x27;s Approach to Diversity; and (3) TFA&#x27;s Approach to Criticism and Critics.

In February 2019, over 300 TFA Alumni signed a letter objecting to the organization putting pressure on young teachers to cross the picket line during the Oakland teachers&#x27; strike. Because TFA corps members are often AmeriCorps members, and striking is a prohibited activity for AmeriCorps members, TFA educators risked losing their AmeriCorps award if they went on strike.

==Organizational growth==
Teach For America has witnessed sustained growth over the course of the past two decades. The chart below reflects this growth by highlighting the changes in various performance indicators.
°FY 2013 was a shortened fiscal year as Teach For America shifted to a fiscal year based on the school year. FY 2013 began January 10, 2012, and ended May 31, 2013. Beginning in FY 2014, the fiscal year began June 1 and concluded May 31 of the following year

==Acceptance rate==
In 2013, the organization received its largest applicant pool to date, with 57,000 people applying to the program. The organization selected approximately 6,000 of the applicants, making its acceptance rate less than 11 percent, the most selective corps in its history. Between 2008 and 2013, acceptance rates hovered around 11-15 percent.

Between 2014 and 2015, the organization maintained a 15 percent acceptance rate despite dropping application numbers.

==Receipt of philanthropic funds==
Teach for America lists many of its significant contributors on its website. The list includes foundations, individuals, corporations, and public and investor categories.

Among the biggest donors to the organization are the Walton Family Foundation, which has donated to TFA since 1993. In November 2015 the Walton Family Foundation announced a gift to TFA of $50 million over three years to support recruitment efforts and professional development for 4,000 new teachers across the country.

Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock are listed as Champion Donors on the organization&#x27;s website, having donated more than $5 million. The organization&#x27;s annual Social Innovation Award is named in their honor. The Arthur &amp; Toni Rembe Rock Social Innovation Award is open to current TFA corps members and alumni. Winners receive $100,000 to build education-focused social ventures.

In 2011, the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation was the first philanthropic organization to commit to the endowment fund with a pledge of $25 million and called upon other funders to match this figure. Three additional philanthropic donors—the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, the Robertson Foundation, and Steve Mandel—stepped up and each provided $25 million in matching funds.

==Publications==
===Teaching as Leadership===

Teaching As Leadership: The Highly Effective Teacher&#x27;s Guide to Closing the Achievement Gap () is a book by Steven Farr, Chief Knowledge Office at Teach For America, published by Jossey Bass in 2010. The book outlines six principles that Farr believes will help teachers become leaders within the classroom, in particular, classrooms in low-income communities.

In &quot;Childhood Education&quot;, Joey Estes says &quot;This book, while focusing on low-income, high-need schools and classrooms, offers a unique and candid look at the people who are successfully making a huge difference in the lives of under-served students every day.&quot;

<text>Tomintoul (; from , meaning &quot;Hillock of the Barn&quot;) is a village in the Moray council area of Scotland in the historic county of Banffshire.

Within Cairngorms National Park, the village lies close to the banks of the River Avon and is said by some to be the highest village in the Scottish Highlands, although at it is still much lower than the highest village in Scotland (Wanlockhead, in Dumfries and Galloway at ). By 1841, the parish reached a population of 1,722. In 1951, this had fallen to just 531. The 2011 census indicated a village population of 716 people. The village is historically part of the Parish of Kirmichael.

The 2004 film &quot;One Last Chance&quot;, starring Kevin McKidd and Dougray Scott, was filmed in the village and the areas around it.

The village is on the famed Malt Whisky Trail, which also includes Dufftown, Keith, Tomnavoulin, and Marypark. The surrounding countryside forms the Glenlivet Estate.

Tomintoul Golf Club, founded in 1897, disappeared at the time of World War II.

==History==
The village was laid out on a grid pattern by Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon in 1775. It followed the construction, 20 years previously, of a military road by William Caulfeild – now the A939. The duke&#x27;s motivation for his efforts was the hope that a permanent settlement would minimise cattle theft and illegal distilling of spirits in the area. Estimates suggest that in the early 1700s there had been up to 200 illicit stills in the Livet glen, with spirits smuggled out over the Ladder hills.

In this &quot;model village&quot;, he encouraged the production of linen but this plan was not successful; the locals stuck to subsistence agriculture, growing vegetables and raising cattle. A report in 1797 indicated that there were 37 families in the village &quot;without any industry. All of them sell whisky and all of them drink it&quot;. In 1820, some 14,000 illegal stills were confiscated annually in the Livet glen area. The 1823 Excise Act allowed for making whisky under licence and some took advantage in order to make a legal profit. One of the first to do so was George Smith who started a distillery on his farm in the nearby village of Minmore. That small operation, founded in 1824, eventually grew to become The Glenlivet distillery in Upper Drumin ( from Tomintoul) which produces &quot;The Glenlivet&quot; single malt whisky, known around the world. 

In the Victorian era, the village was receiving some tourism; in 1860, there were three inns here. An 1857 &quot;Commercial Gazetteer&quot; described the community as a mean-looking village on a bleak moor with superstitious residents. The 1882–4 Frances Groome&#x27;s Ordnance &quot;Gazetteer for Scotland&quot; also did not depict Tomintoul as a prosperous village:&quot;Consisting of a central square and a single street, running ¾ mile north-north-westward, it is described by the Queen, under date 5 Sept. 1860, as &#x27;the most tumble-down, poor-looking place I ever saw-a long street with three inns, miserable dirty-looking houses and people, and a sad look of wretchedness about it&#x27;. ... Tomintoul has a post office with money order, savings&#x27; bank, and telegraph departments, a public and a Roman Catholic school, cattle fairs ... and hiring fairs ...&quot;

Both churches, built prior to 1840, remain open in the village, Tomintoul Church and St Michael&#x27;s. According to the above source, the population was as follows: 530 in 1839 and 686 by 1881.

==Regeneration efforts==


Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit in 1860 helped boost tourism which still remains the primary economic activity. Marketing initiatives in the area today include SnowRoads and North East 250 scenic routes. Still billed as &quot;the highest village in the Highlands&quot;, with a town square and Victorian buildings, Tomintoul offers tourists options such as snowsports in winter. Areas of interest in the vicinity include Glenlivet Estate (fishing as well as walking, cycling and horseback riding trails), north eastern Cairngorms and the (Speyside) Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail. The village also has a small museum, the Tomintoul &amp; Glenlivet Discovery Centre, which focuses on life in the highlands through history.

The primary retailers for tourists include the Tomintoul Gallery that sells work created by local artists, the A&#x27;anside Studios that sell arts and crafts and the Whisky Castle, which offers hundreds of single malts. The castle has operated for over a century and offers whisky from every major distillery, as well as some rare products from distilleries no longer in operation. The Tomintoul Distillery, in nearby Ballindalloch, provides some employment; the company has been making whisky here for many decades. There is no visitor centre but some visits are allowed, by prior appointment.

The two main hotels in the village had closed by 2010, however. In an attempt to improve the economy, the area created the Regeneration Strategy and Action Plan in 2011, which led to the establishment of the Tomintoul and Glenlivet Development Trust in 2012. The group has taken several steps to &quot;develop, inspire and embrace a vibrant future for the Tomintoul and Glenlivet area&quot;, seeking investment and promoting the area&#x27;s visitor attractions. The regeneration effort obtained funding of approximately £3.5 million to be used for projects that would benefit the &quot;cultural and natural landscape&quot; of the area.

The village also made the Glenlivet Walking Festival an annual event as suggested by the 2012 Regeneration Strategy and Action Plan. In addition to tourism and the nearby whisky industry, sheep and beef cattle are raised on farms around the village.

==Notable people==

Lynn Cassells and Sandra Baer farm the nearby Lynbreck Croft.

The immunologist Prof Kenneth Boyd Fraser FRSE retired to Tomintoul and died there.

The artist and writer Mary Barnes died in Tomintoul in 2001, after living there for some time.

;&quot;Mrs MacKay&quot;

The late Terry Wogan helped bring the A939 road from Tomintoul to Cockbridge to national attention, along with local, fictional postmistress &quot;Mrs MacKay&quot;. As reported in the Scottish daily newspaper The National: In 1999, after he criticised the council for never being prepared for the snow, locals wrote in to say it was not the local authority that cleared the snow, but rather Mrs MacKay, the silver-haired postmistress and her silver-handled shovel. She was doing the best she could, they insisted. For the next decade listeners would phone in with sightings of the near mythical Mrs MacKay shovelling snow. Sometimes, they said, she would be out shovelling snow as early as June.

;Lord Tony Williams

In the 1990s an individual, styled by the media as Lord Tony Williams, spent £1 million on improving the Gordon Arms Hotel (now Hotel Square) and invested money in other businesses. He was later shown to be a fraud who had stolen £4.5 million from his former employer, the Metropolitan Police and was sentenced to seven years in prison.

The author Captain W. E. Johns lived in the Richmond Hotel at Tomintoul from 1944 to 1947, before renting Pitchroy Lodge on the nearby Ballindalloch Estate from 1947 to 1953.

;Percy Toplis - The &quot;Monocled Mutineer&quot;

Percy Toplis took refuge in the area in 1920 before being discovered by a local farmer. He made his escape, shooting and wounding the farmer and a police constable while doing so. Within a week, he was shot dead by police in England.

;Grigor Willox

Grigor Willox was a reputed white witch who lived in Tomintoul in the 18th century. He was said to derive his powers from two amulets: a brass hook from a kelpie&#x27;s bridle and a mermaid&#x27;s crystal. Among his alleged powers were making cows produce milk, curing barren women, and detecting thieves.

== Climate ==
Tomintoul has an oceanic climate (Cfb), bordering on subpolar oceanic (Cfc). Tomintoul does not have an official MetOffice weather station, and the temperature values below are simulated. Due to the villages&#x27; location northeast of the Cairngorms massif, it is exposed to many snow-bearing wind directions; this is consolidated by its elevation of 345m above sea level and its latitude at 57°N. As a result, Tomintoul is one of the coldest and snowiest settlements in the UK.

<text>Caliban upon Setebos is a poem written by the British poet Robert Browning and published in his 1864 &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; collection. It deals with Caliban, a character from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and his reflections on Setebos, the brutal god believed in by himself and his late mother Sycorax. Some scholars see Browning as being of the belief that God is in the eye of the beholder, and this is emphasized by a barbaric character believing in a barbaric god. An offshoot of this interpretation is the argument that Browning is applying evolutionary theory to religious development. Others feel that he was satirizing theologians of his time, who attempted to understand God as a reflection of themselves; this theory is supported by the epigraph, Psalm 50:21, &quot;Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself.&quot; This could be taken as God mocking Caliban (and Browning&#x27;s contemporaries) for their methods of attempting to understand Him.

==Excerpt==
The poem begins (text in [brackets]) with a brief narration, but quickly moves to Caliban&#x27;s monologue, in which he contemplates his god:

In lunar religious calendars, Bhadra begins on the new moon or full moon in August or September and is the sixth month of the year. The festival of Ganesha Chaturthi, which celebrates the birthday of Ganesha, is observed from 4-10 Bhadrapada in the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) and is the main holiday of the year in Maharashtra. Per the Shaka calendar, the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) of Bhadrapada is reserved for the veneration of the dead. This period is known as Pitru Paksha.

In the Vaishnava calendar, Hrishikesha governs this month.

Krishna was born on the eighth day of Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada (according to the purnimanta tradition) and Radha was born on the eighth day of Shukla Paksha of Bhadrapada. Vaishnavas and some Shaivas fast during the month of Purattasi in Tamil Nadu and visit Vaishnava temples on Saturday.

<text>The Malabar danio (Devario malabaricus) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family Danionidae. Originating in Sri Lanka and the west coast of India, the fish has been circulated throughout the world through the aquarium fish trade. It grows to a maximum length of but rarely exceeds in a home aquarium.

The Malabar danio is found in tropical climates in a wide variety of waters, from mountain streams to small pools, but it prefers flowing waters. It is an active, schooling fish that prefers to be in groups. Its diet consists of insects and plant matter.

Malabar danios are oviparous, and spawn in shallow water after heavy rains among the plants growing on the bottom. An adult will spawn around 200 light-orange, sticky eggs that will hatch in one to two days. The fry will be free-swimming after the fifth day. The parents must be removed from aquaria to prevent them from eating the eggs.

The species was earlier incorrectly considered a synonym of &quot;Devario aequipinnatus&quot;, which is a valid name for a different species.

<doc id="1161549" wikidata="Q6912548" url="?curid=1161549" title="Morley R.F.C.">
<text>Morley Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Morley, West Yorkshire. England. The club are famous for playing in a maroon kit and thus are nicknamed &quot;The Maroons&quot;. They currently play in Regional 2 North East, a level six league in the English rugby union league system, following their relegation at the end of the 2017-18 season.

==Club history==
Morley played and won its first match on the 9 November 1878, against Dewsbury Birkdale. Morley was a member of the Northern Union, however, when the Northern Union clubs broke away from the RFU to form what is now rugby league, the Morley representatives missed the train to Huddersfield as they were still in the pub. As a result, Morley remained with the RFU and rugby union.

Ben Gronow was the coach for Morley R.F.C. in the 1930s, however when a history of the club was produced some years later, due to his previous rugby league associations, he was identified as &#x27;unknown&#x27; in a team photograph.

When the club won the Yorkshire Cup for the first time in 1932 in its fourth final, Morley borough council granted permission for the municipal coat of arms to be worn on the club&#x27;s jerseys. The figures and devices on the coat of arms were symbolic of the principal industries of the Borough - the manufacture of woollen cloth, coal mining and quarrying.

When Morley celebrated its centenary in 1978, a rugby ball bearing the club&#x27;s foundation date replaced the maxim &quot;Industria Omnia Vincit&quot; (&quot;Work Conquers All&quot;) beneath the shield.

Morley have won the Yorkshire Cup 11 times, and 3 times in a row in the 1970s. They also hold claim to being the longest-enduring holders of the cup, having won it in 1938 and 1939. The cup was not contested again until 1947 due to the Second World War. During the war years, the trophy was in held in safe keeping, in a box under the club secretary&#x27;s bed.

In the early 1990s the club climbed to the national second division (which is now National Division One), the division immediately below today&#x27;s Premiership. However, by 1996 they had dropped down to the third tier, then called National Division three which today would be National League 1.

2005 was a historic year for Morley as they defeated Westoe RFC to win The Powergen Intermediate Cup at Twickenham. The victory capped a Yorkshire hat trick as on the same day Sheffield Tigers won the Powergen Junior Vase and Leeds Tykes defeated Bath in the final of the Powergen Cup.
In 2005–06 the club was promoted as champions from the Powergen League North 1 and in 2006 Morley were again at Twickenham reaching the cup final for the second successive year. However, they failed in attempting to become the first team to retain the cup, losing 11-6 to Stockport in a below par performance. However, the season was still a great success as Morley finished as league champions and clinched promotion.

In the 2006–07 season the team finished 6th in the league (a mid-table position). However, in the 2007–08 season Morley were relegated from National Division Three North to North 1. In the 2008–09 season despite a slow start Morley finished strongly and ended the season in 3rd position in the league, narrowly missing out on promotion.

In the 2009–10 season Morley had an excellent season, losing just 3 league games. As a result, they finished top of the league and gained promotion into National Division 2 North for 2010–11 season.

Recent seasons have been less kind to the club and they were soon back in National 3 North and have been relegated again and for the 2012–13 season found themselves in the sixth tier, North 1 East. Since then they have been a &quot;yo-yo&quot; team, going between levels five and six. Each relegation brought instant promotion (albeit via the playoffs) but Morley has been unable to consolidate their position at level five and are once again (2018-19) at level 6, North 1 East.

<doc id="1161552" wikidata="Q7140851" url="?curid=1161552" title="Parts stress modelling">
<text>Parts stress modelling is a method in engineering and especially electronics to find an expected value for the rate of failure of the mechanical and electronic components of a system. It is based upon the idea that the more components that there are in the system, and the greater stress that they undergo in operation, the more often they will fail.

Parts count modelling is a simpler variant of the method, with component stress not taken into account.

Various organisations have published standards specifying how parts stress modelling should be carried out. Some from electronics are:

* MIL-HDBK-217 (US Department of Defense)
* SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment
* HRD-4 (British Telecom)
* SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis
* and many others

These &quot;standards&quot; produce different results, often by a factor of more than two, for the same modelled system. The differences illustrate the fact that this modelling is not an exact science. System designers often have to do the modelling using a standard specified by a customer, so that the customer can compare the results with other systems modelled in the same way.

All of these standards compute an expected overall failure rate for all the components in the system, which is not necessarily the rate at which the system as a whole fails. Systems often incorporate redundancy or fault tolerance so that they do not fail when an individual component fails.

Several companies provide programs for performing parts stress modelling calculations. It&#x27;s also possible to do the modelling with a spreadsheet.

All these models implicitly assume the idea of &quot;random failure&quot;. Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate, analogous to the process of nuclear decay. One justification for this idea is that components fail by a process of wearout, a predictable decay after manufacture, but that the wearout life of individual components is scattered widely about some very long mean. The observed &quot;random&quot; failures are then just the extreme outliers at the early edge of this distribution. However, this may not be the whole picture.

All the models use basically the same process, with detailed variations.
* Identify the components in the system
** Such as R123, 10kOhm carbon film resistor
* For each component, determine the component model to use from the standard
** Such as &quot;resistor, film, &lt; 1 Megohm&quot; or &quot;Connector, multi-pin&quot;
* From the standard&#x27;s component model, discover what, if any, complexity parameter is needed, and find the value of that parameter for this component
** Such as pin count for a connector or gate count for a chip
* From the standard&#x27;s component model, discover what thermal stress curve applies, and find the value of the temperature in operation for this component
** The failure rate of connectors may change little with temperature, while that of capacitors may change greatly
* From the standard&#x27;s component model, discover what, if any, part stress parameter is needed, what part stress curve applies, and find the value of that part stress parameter for this component in this application
** A part stress might be the applied power as a fraction of the component&#x27;s rated power, or the applied voltage as a fraction of the rated voltage
* From the standard&#x27;s component model, find the base failure rate for this component, and modify that according to the complexity parameter, the operating temperature and thermal stress curve, the part stress parameter and part stress curve, with arithmetic specified by the standard. This now is the expected failure rate for this component in this application
* Add up all the results for every component in the system to find the overall failure rate for all components in this system.

Other global modification parameters can be employed, which are assumed to have the same effect on every component failure rate. The most usual are the environment, such as ground benign or airborne, commercial, and the purchasing quality assurance process.

<text>HMS &quot;Quorn&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy, built in 1940 and sunk off the Normandy coast on 3 August 1944. The class were named after British fox and stag hunts, in this case, the Quorn Hunt, which was originally based in Quorn Leicestershire.

&quot;Quorn&quot; was built by J. Samuel White and Co. at Cowes, Isle of Wight. A Type 1 Hunt-class destroyer, she was launched on 27 March 1940 and completed on 21 September 1940 with the pennant number L66. She was adopted by the civil community of Rushden, Northamptonshire, as part of Warship Week in 1942.

==Service history==
===1941===
&quot;Quorn&quot; joined the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich. The flotilla was tasked with convoy protection, anti-shipping and patrol duties. &quot;Quorn&quot; would stay with the flotilla for the whole of her commission. In April &quot;Quorn&quot; was superficially damaged by two delay-action bombs, that exploded from her port quarter.

In August whilst on passage from Harwich to Chatham, &quot;Quorn&quot; set off a mine off her port bow. She was repaired at Chatham Dockyard. This took until September to complete.

===1942===
In April &quot;Quorn&quot; hit another mine that blew a hole in the port side of the ship. Two of ship&#x27;s company were killed and one injured. Her No 1 boiler room was flooded and major structural damage sustained. She was towed to Harwich and then to Sheerness where repairs took 4 months to complete.

On 13 October &quot;Quorn&quot; was one of the five destroyers that intercepted the German auxiliary cruiser in the English Channel. &quot;Komet&quot; was sunk and two M-class minesweepers were heavily damaged and set on fire. An hour later a second patrolling force of the same operation engaged a group of escort vessels, sinking an R boat, (minesweeper) and damaging a torpedo boat.

===1943===
North Sea convoy protection duties with the 21st Destroyer Flotilla

===1944===
In June &quot;Quorn&quot; was an escort for convoys of personnel during Operation Neptune, the naval support of Operation Overlord, the Normandy Landings. On 3 August, she was hit and sunk by a human torpedo piloted by Oberfernschreibmeister Herbert Berrer of the Kriegsmarine during a heavy attack on the British assault area by a force of E-boats, Linse explosive motorboats, human torpedoes and low flying aircraft. Those that survived the initial attack spent up to eight hours in the water before being rescued, and many of these died. One hundred and thirty of her crew were lost.

<doc id="1161559" wikidata="Q7882537" url="?curid=1161559" title="Liberal Catholicism">
<text>Liberal Catholicism (or Neo-Catholicism) was a current of thought within the Catholic Church influenced by classical liberalism and promoting the separation of church and state, freedom of religion in the civic arena, expanded suffrage, and broad-based education. It was influential in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, especially in France. It is largely identified with French political theorists such as Felicité Robert de Lamennais, Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes René de Montalembert influenced, in part, by a similar contemporaneous movement in Belgium.

Being predominantly political in nature, liberal Catholicism as a movement was distinct from the contemporary theological movement of modernism. The movement is also distinct from the attitude of historical and present-day Roman Catholics who are described as theologically progressive or liberal.

Elements of liberal Catholicism were repeatedly condemned by the pre-Vatican II Holy See, particularly in the encyclicals &quot;Mirari vos&quot; (1832) of Pope Gregory XVI, &quot;Quanta cura&quot; (1864) of Pope Pius IX, and the dogmatic constitution &quot;Pastor aeternus&quot; (1870) of the First Vatican Council.

Also vehemently criticized in the work &quot;Liberalism is a Sin&quot; by Félix Sardà y Salvany, published in 1884.

== Definition ==
Liberal Catholicism has been defined as &quot;in essence a trend among sincere Catholics to exalt freedom as a primary value and to draw from this consequences in social, political, and religious life, seeking to reconcile the principles on which Christian France was founded with those that derived from the French Revolution&quot;. The phrase was used to describe the currents of thought and action that arose in the wake of Napoleon&#x27;s remaking of Europe, and the restoration of traditional monarchies.

== History ==

===Belgium===
The National Congress of Belgium, an alliance between Roman Catholics and secular liberals on the basis of mutually recognized rights and freedoms, adopted in 1831 a constitution that enshrined several of the freedoms for which liberal Catholicism campaigned. The Congress Column in Brussels, erected in honour of the congress, has at its base four bronze statues that represent the four basic freedoms enshrined in the constitution: freedom of religion, freedom of association, education and freedom of the press. These four freedoms are also reflected in the names of the four streets that lead to the &quot;Place de la Liberté/Vrijheidsplein&quot; (Freedom Square) of Brussels: the &quot;Rue des Cultes/Eredienststraat&quot; (Religion Street), the &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Association/Verenigingsstraat&quot; (Association Street), the &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Enseignement/Onderrichtstraat&quot; (Education Street) and the &quot;Rue de la Presse/Drukpersstraat&quot; (Press Street). The constitution adopted almost all of Lamennais&#x27;s proposals for the separation of church and state, granting the Catholic Church independence in church appointments and public activities, and almost complete supervision of Catholic education.

J.P.T Bury suggests that Lamennais and his associates found inspiration in a Belgian Liberal Catholic movement centered in Malines and led by Archbishop de Méan&#x27;s vicar-general, Engelbert Sterckx. Largely Catholic Belgium seceded from the Netherlands in 1830 and established a constitutional monarchy. Sterckx, who became archbishop in 1832 found a way not merely to tolerate the new liberal constitution, but to expand the Church under the new liberties guaranteed.

At a noted Catholic congress in Malines, Belgium in 1863, Montalembert gave two long addresses on Catholic Liberalism, including &quot;A Free Church in a Free State&quot;.

===France===
The movement of liberal Catholicism was initiated in France by Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais with the support of Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, Charles Forbes René de Montalembert and Olympe-Philippe Gerbet, Bishop of Perpignan, while a parallel movement arose in Belgium, led by François Antoine Marie Constantin de Méan et de Beaurieux, Archbishop of Mechelen, and his vicar general Engelbert Sterckx.

Lamennais founded the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Ami de l&#x27;Ordre&quot; (precursor of today&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;), the first issue of which appeared on 16 October 1830, with the motto &quot;God and Liberty&quot;. The paper was aggressively democratic, demanding rights of local administration, an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, universal freedom of conscience, freedom of education, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press. Styles of worship were to be criticized, improved or abolished in absolute submission to the spiritual, not to the temporal authority.

On 7 December 1830, the editors articulated their demands as follows:
With the help of Montalembert, Lammenais founded the &quot;&quot;, which became a far-reaching organization with agents throughout France who monitored violations of religious freedom. As a result, the periodical&#x27;s career was stormy and its circulation opposed by conservative bishops. In response, Lamennais, Montalembert and Lacordaire suspended their work and in November 1831 set out to Rome to obtain the approval of Pope Gregory XVI. Archbishop Quelen of Paris had warned Lammenais that he was being unrealistic and was viewed as a demagogue in favor of revolution. As Quelen was a Gallican, Lammenais ignored him.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter. After much opposition, they gained an audience on 15 March 1832 only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. Prince Metternich, whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation. The Pope&#x27;s advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais&#x27;s opinions. &quot;Mirari vos&quot; was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais&#x27;s views without mentioning him by name.

After this, Lamennais and his two lieutenants declared that out of deference to the pope they would not resume the publication of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; and dissolved the &quot;Agence générale&quot; as well. Lamennais soon distanced himself from the Catholic Church, which was a blow to the credibility of the liberal Catholic movement, and the other two moderated their tone, but still campaigned for liberty of religious education and liberty of association.

They corresponded with Ignaz von Döllinger regarding their views on reconciling the Roman Catholic Church with the principles of modern society (liberalism); which views had aroused much suspicion in Ultramontane, mainly Jesuit-dominated, circles. In 1832 Lammenais and his friends Lacordaire and Montalembert, visited Germany, obtaining considerable sympathy in their attempts to bring about a modification of the Roman Catholic attitude to modern problems and liberal political principles.

===Italy===

In 19th-century Italy, the liberal Catholic movement had a lasting impact in that it ended the association of the ideal of national independence with that of anti-clerical revolution.

<doc id="1161569" wikidata="Q750239" url="?curid=1161569" title="Vatra Dornei">
<text>Vatra Dornei (; ; ; ) is a city in Suceava County, north-eastern Romania. It is situated in the historical region of Bukovina. Vatra Dornei is the fifth largest urban settlement in the county, with a population of 12,578 inhabitants, according to the 2021 census. 

It was declared a city in 2000, being the newest and smallest in the county. The city administers three villages: Argestru, Roșu, and Todireni. Vatra Dornei is a well known spa and ski resort in the Carpathian Mountains and also is home to the historic Vatra Dornei Casino.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===

The town&#x27;s current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2020 Romanian local elections:

==Geography==
Vatra Dornei is located in north-east Romania, in the south-western part of Suceava County, away from Suceava, the capital of the county. The city of Câmpulung Moldovenesc is away, the city of Bistrița away, the town of Gura Humorului away and the town of Broșteni away.

Vatra Dornei is at the confluence of the rivers Bistrița and Dorna, in the Dorna Depression. Because of its mountain surroundings, the city is a spa and ski resort, one of the oldest resorts in Romania. Vatra Dornei is connected to the Romanian national railway system and has two railway stations, Vatra Dornei and Vatra Dornei Băi, both historical monuments. The European route E58, that links the region of Moldavia with Transylvania, crosses the city.

==History==
The earliest written mention of the settlement is from 1592. Together with the rest of Bukovina, Vatra Dornei was under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy (later Austria-Hungary) from 1775 to 1918. This was a period of development for the town, which became a well known resort in the early 19th century. Between 1925 and 1950, Vatra Dornei was part of the former Câmpulung County. From 1950 to present it&#x27;s part of Suceava County.

The historic Vatra Dornei Casino is located in the city center.

== Demographics ==

Until the early 1950s, Vatra Dornei had an ethnically mixed population of Romanians, Germans (more specifically Bukovina Germans), Ukrainians, and Jews. The large synagogue and a picturesque Jewish cemetery bear witness to the Jewish presence and historical legacy in the area.

Vatra Dornei reached its peak population in 1992, when about 18,500 people were living within the town limits. Then the city population declined gradually.

==Tourism==
Vatra Dornei is a well known ski resort in the Carpathian Mountains. There are ski slopes nearby the city, attracting tourists in winter season. Vatra Dornei is surrounded by large forest areas, proper places for practicing alpine tourism. There are mineral water springs in the city limits and its surroundings, that helped the settlement to develop as a spa. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Bukovina had only two spa towns: Vatra Dornei and Solca.

Vatra Dornei has several hotels, two museums (The Ethnographic Museum and The Museum of Natural Sciences) and a few old buildings that are considered historical and architectural monuments: the casino, the main spa building, the two railway stations, the town hall, &quot;Sentinela&quot; Spring, the post office building, and a few old churches.

Vatra Dornei is also part of the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail.

<text>The World Association of Universities and Colleges (WAUC) is an institutional educational accreditation body not recognized by the United States Department of Education. It is run by Maxine Asher, director of the American World University, an unaccredited school. WAUC&#x27;s website claims that &quot;laws in the U.S.A. prohibit the recognition of global accreditation associations&quot;.

==History==
According to Maxine Asher&#x27;s American World University, World Association of Universities and Colleges was started in 1992.

In March 2001, WAUC was reported to be using an executive suite in Henderson, Nevada as its address.

In 2004, Asher was forced to close down the World University of Iowa, a Hawaii-based institution similar to American World University and accredited by World Association of Universities and Colleges. As part of a summary judgement, she was ordered to cease operations, refund tuition money to all students, and pay $240,000 in damages. The action came as part of a statewide crackdown on unaccredited schools, as many had relocated there after 1999 in an effort to evade regulation in the mainland United States. During court proceedings, Asher refused to provide school documentation such as a list of students.

In June 2007, the organization&#x27;s website listed an address in Beverly Hills, California and WAUC listed 57 accredited schools and 28 nonaccredited &quot;members only&quot; schools. In 2010, it offered accreditation for limited time offer at $500.

As of September 2011, WAUC&#x27;s website was offline.

In 2012, the World Association of Universities and Colleges claims &quot;a membership of forty universities, with dozens of other worthy institutions in the process of application.&quot;.

<doc id="1161575" wikidata="Q463051" url="?curid=1161575" title="Catherine Schell">
<text>Catherine Schell (born Katherina &quot;[[Freiherr|Freiin]]&quot; Schell von Bauschlott, 17 July 1944) is a Hungarian-born British actress who came to prominence in British film and television productions from the 1960s. Her notable roles include the Bond girl Nancy in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), Lady Claudine Litton in &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975), Countess Scarlioni in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;City of Death&quot; (1979), and a regular role as Maya in Year Two of the television series &quot;&quot; (1976-1977).

==Early life==
Schell&#x27;s father, Baron Pál Schell von Bauschlott (Nagyida, 5 September 1898 - Munich, 20 October 1979), was a Hungarian diplomat of three-quarter Hungarian ancestry; her mother (m. Budapest, 28 January 1940) was Countess Katalin Mária Etelka Georgina Erzsébet Teleki de Szék (Budapest, 11 November 1917 - ?). &quot;Schell&quot; is the family name, while &quot;von Bauschlott&quot; indicates the place in Germany where the Schell family owned its main estate.

Fleeing Hungary in advance of the Soviets and communism, the family lived in poverty until 1948, finding asylum in Austria: first in Vienna, then in Salzburg. In 1950, the family emigrated to the United States, where Schell&#x27;s father acquired American citizenship.

Schell entered a convent school in the New York City borough of Staten Island. In 1957, her father joined Radio Free Europe and the family moved to Munich where Schell developed an interest in acting and attended the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts.

==Career==

===Film===

She acted under the alternate name &quot;Catherina von Schell&quot; early in her career. Under this name she made her film debut as the title character in the little-known German-language film &quot;Lana, Queen of the Amazons&quot; (1964). She appeared as Bond girl Nancy in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), with George Lazenby in the lead. Around the same time, she appeared in Hammer Films science-fiction thriller &quot;Moon Zero Two&quot; (also 1969) cast in the role of Clementine Taplin. She appeared with Bette Davis, now credited as Catherine Schell, in &quot;Madame Sin&quot; (1972), a television film made by ITC which was released theatrically in some markets.

Schell appeared opposite Peter Sellers in the comedy &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975) as Lady Claudine Lytton. Schell appeared with Sellers again in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1979), one of his last films.

===Television===
Schell&#x27;s first TV credit was &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; (1967), a West German comedy in which she played Nele and was billed as Katherina von Schell.

Schell spent much of her career in British television, appearing in more than 47 series spanning a period of nearly 30 years. She played regular roles in series such as &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, &quot;Looking For Clancy&quot;, &quot;One by One&quot;, &quot;Mog&quot; and &quot;Wish Me Luck&quot;, in addition to many guest appearances, including &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (starring alongside future James Bond actor Roger Moore), &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, &quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot;, &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; and &quot;The Search for the Nile&quot;.

Schell appeared in the science-fiction series &quot;&quot; as a robotic servant (&quot;Guardian of Piri&quot;, 1975), and returned to the series in its second season as the regular character Maya, a shape-shifting &quot;metamorph&quot; from the planet Psychon. Schell appeared in another British science-fiction series, as Countess Scarlioni in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;City of Death&quot; (1979).

==Personal life==

===Family===
Schell&#x27;s brother, Paul Rudolf (born 1940), now known as Paul von Schell, has acted in German-language productions. A younger brother, Peter (1941–68), died young. Through a German great-grandfather, Schell is related to Louis XIV of France (1638–1715), Philip II, Duke of Orléans (1674–1723), Regent of France and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor (1708–65). She is not believed to be related to the Austrian-Swiss actors Maximilian and Maria Schell.

===Marriages===
While filming &quot;Amsterdam Affair&quot; in 1968, Schell met and married her first husband, British actor William Marlowe (1930–2003), and moved to London. The marriage ended in divorce in 1977. Schell married director Bill Hays (1938–2006) in 1982. In 1984, they worked together for the first time as husband and wife on a TV production of Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s play &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;.

===Retirement===
Schell&#x27;s career continued into the mid-1990s, after which she retired from acting and opened Chambre d&#x27;Hôtes Valentin, a small guesthouse in Bonneval, Haute-Loire, France, which would become a popular destination for fans of &quot;&quot;. She reportedly sold the inn after the death of her second husband in 2006.

Schell made her first convention appearance at MainMission:2000, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of &quot;Space: 1999&quot; held in New York City. To date, she has appeared at only one other convention, mainly due to her second husband&#x27;s declining health.

Schell contributed a foreword to the &quot;Space: 1999&quot; novel &quot;Born for Adversity&quot;, written by David McIntee and published by Powys Media in 2010.

Schell&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Constant Alien&quot; was published in 2016.

She subsequently came out of acting retirement to portray the Grand Duchess Valeria in the BBC One/Netflix series &quot;Dracula&quot;, which aired in 2020.

<text>The Regiment Huzaren Prins Alexander is an Armoured corps of the Royal Netherlands Army, named after Prince Alexander, the second son of King Willem II. This regiment represented the former 3rd Hussars Regiment, formed in 1814 (origins date back to 1672). It was known as the Red (because of the red colour on their uniform) or Guards Hussars, but was never a Guards regiment.

The Regiment Huzaren Prinses Catharina-Amalia, which is a company in the 414th Panzer Battalion, is a cavalry regiment formed in late 2020 through the amalgamation of three other Dutch cavalry regiments that, at the time, existed in suspension - the Regiment Huzaren Prins Alexander, Regiment Huzaren Van Sytzama and Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje.

== Tank battalions of the Regiment Hussars Prince Alexander ==

41 Tankbattalion – Activated on June 1, 1953, and based at Hohne Camp, Germany. The unit operated the Leopard 1 from 1971–1984. In 1983 (or 1985) the unit received their first Leopard 2A4s which they operated until April 1994. On August 1, 1994, the unit was disbanded,

42nd Tankbattalion – Before 1991 42 Tkbat was part of the Regiment Hussars Prince Alexander. The unit was activated on April 1, 1972, and operated with the Leopard 1 until July 1985.

52nd Tankbattalion – Activated on May 1, 1987, at the mobilization complex Soesterberg and equipped with the Leopard 1V. In 1992 the Leopard 1V were replaced by the Leopard 2A4 and on February 1, 1994, the unit was disbanded.

57th Tankbattalion – Located at the mobilization complex Wilp and equipped with the Leopard 2A4 from 1986 – July 1, 1992. On July 1, 1992, the unit was disbanded.

58th Tankbattalion – Activated in December 1973 and located at mobilization-complex Wijchen. The unit was equipped with the Leopard 1V from 1986 - 1992. The unit was disbanded on January 1, 1994.

101st Tankbattalion – Activated on October 15, 1957. Before the Leopard it was equipped with the Centurion tank. In November 1984 these Centurions were replaced by the Leopard 1V. From February 1992–1998 the unit was equipped with the Leopard 2A4.In 1998 the A4s were replaced by the A5 and from February 2003 the A6 replaced the A5s. The unit was activated at Soesterberg, then moved to Seedorf and then disbanded on December 20, 2005. 101 Tkbat was disbanded and the two companies of the battalion were split up between 11th Tkbat and 42nd tankbat where they became the 3rd company (C Squadron).

<text>Michael Wayne Carvin (born December 12, 1944) is an American jazz drummer.

==Biography==
Born in Houston, Texas, Carvin began his musical training at the age of six with his father, one of the top drummers in Houston. By the age of twelve, Carvin began playing professionally and won what would be the first of five consecutive Texas rudimental championships. Carvin&#x27;s career has included two years as a staff drummer with Motown Records, as well as studio and television work on the West Coast.

Joining Freddie Hubbard&#x27;s band in 1973, Carvin moved to New York City, where he gained a reputation as one of the most formidable drummers on the jazz scene. A prime example of his work with Hubbard can be seen on the Mosaic Records/Jazz Icons DVD released in fall 2011 featuring Carvin with Hubbard’s very first touring group.

In addition to leading his own bands, Carvin has played and recorded with Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Jackie McLean, Hank Jones, McCoy Tyner, Illinois Jacquet, Pharoah Sanders, Bobby Hutcherson, James Moody, Hampton Hawes, Ruth Brown, Johnny Hartman, Abbey Lincoln, Jimmy Smith, Hugh Masekela, Alice Coltrane, Cecil Taylor, Charles Brown, Terumasa Hino, Bobby Watson, Billy Bang, and many others.

Carvin has recorded on more than 250 albums. He is also a drum teacher and clinician.

<text>Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Lagos (born June 11, 1971) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a midfielder. He is the current sporting director and former head coach of Minnesota United FC.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in St. Paul, Minnesota Lagos played college soccer for the NCAA Division-I Milwaukee Panthers from 1990 to 1992, and was named an NSCAA First-Team All-American in 1991. During and after college, from 1990 to 1996, Manny played for his father with the Minnesota Thunder, first as an amateur and a founding member of the club, and later as a professional. Amidst his Thunder days, he also had short stints with Clermont Foot in the French Third Division, and in Spain&#x27;s lower divisions with Lleida.

In 1994, the Thunder&#x27;s last year as an all-amateur side, Lagos led the team through a near-perfect season and was awarded the USL MVP award, having scored 18 goals and 9 assists. Upon leaving the club for MLS in 1996, he was inducted into the Thunder Hall of Fame with career totals of 29 goals and 12 assists; his brother and teammate, Gerard Lagos (who played for the team from 1990 through 2001) is also an inductee. In 2006, Manny was elected to the USL Hall of Fame.

===MLS===
In 1996, midway through the inaugural MLS season, Lagos was signed by the MetroStars. He impressed right away, but his season was cut short after he tore his left-knee&#x27;s ACL, MCL, and LCL in a single horrific injury just six games in. Lagos made a comeback in the next season, playing in 15 league matches, but still impaired and less effective than before. Frustrated with his injuries, the Metros exposed Manny in the 1997 MLS Expansion Draft, where he was taken by the Chicago Fire. Nowhere near fully recovered and considering retirement, he only played one game for the MLS Cup champions in 1998, and went on to make only 9 appearances in 1999, always as a substitute, excluded from the first eleven due to his unreliable health and the Fire&#x27;s surplus of attacking players.

Lagos&#x27; vagabond MLS career took him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny with Ritchie Kotschau on August 2, 1999, part of a trade for Sam George and Paul Dougherty. He came back swinging, scoring 4 goals in 10 games and earning Player of the Week honors. Lagos continued his momentum in 2000, when he scored 8 goals and added 7 assists in 1500 minutes, making him the league&#x27;s tenth-place leader in points per game, but he would eventually request a trade for personal reasons, as his wife disliked Tampa and wished to pursue her law career elsewhere.

He was dealt to the San Jose Earthquakes in January 2001 on a draft-day trade for second-round and third-round picks, and played for the Earthquakes from 2001 through 2003, starting regularly in every season and winning MLS Cups in the bookend years. He enjoyed what was likely his best season in 2001, playing a key role in the Earthquakes&#x27; playoff run by adding 3 goals and 2 assists to regular season totals of 8 and 8. After his tenure with the &#x27;Quakes, Lagos was traded to the Columbus Crew for a third-round draft pick, and was reunited there with long-time friend and youth soccer, college soccer, and Thunder teammate Tony Sanneh after Sanneh signed with the Crew late in 2004. Manny played 18 games and scored 1 goal for the Crew that year, but never really recovered from the last of his many knee surgeries, seeing his playing time dwindle to 5 appearances in 2005. He was waived by Columbus that May to make room for Chris Henderson and retired in June.

In his nine years in MLS, Lagos scored 27 goals and added 36 assists, plus 4 goals and 4 assists in the postseason. Though right-footed, he spent much of his career on the left side of midfield. Noted for his gangly legs and long, awkward strides, Lagos possessed an unusual style on the ball where his technical skill and knack for dribbling past opponents belied his superficially clumsy appearance. He is remembered as a talented player who was dogged by knee injuries throughout his career.

==International career==
Lagos began his international career in the 1992 Summer Olympics, when he scored the second goal in a 3–1 win over Kuwait, the team&#x27;s only victory. His first full cap for the senior national team did not come until over nine years later, on December 9, 2001, against South Korea. He earned three caps for the US from 2001 to 2003, scoring no goals.

==Managerial career==
In January 2006, Lagos was named the Director of Soccer Operations for the Minnesota Thunder. In this role, he has placed particular emphasis on youth development, community relations, and the team&#x27;s stadium search. Manny has also done some sporadic work in broadcasting, serving as a color commentator for XM Radio during the 2006 World Cup.
On February 10, 2010, Lagos was appointed as the head coach of newly expansion NSC Minnesota Stars following the implosion of the Thunder.

Lagos led the Stars to victory in the 2011 NASL Soccer Bowl, and to a runner up finish in the 2012 Soccer Bowl. After a disappointing 2013 season at the helm of the rebranded Minnesota United FC, Lagos led the Loons to the spring and regular season titles in 2014. He was named the NASL Coach of the Year in 2011 and in 2014, the only coach to have won the award twice.

At the conclusion of the 2014 season and the firing of Tampa Bay Rowdies coach Ricky Hill, Lagos became the longest tenured coach in the NASL. In five seasons with Minnesota, Lagos has a coaching record of 54-47-38 (W-L-D).

Upon the move of Minnesota United FC to MLS, he transitioned to a role as Sporting Director of the club.

==Personal life==
He is the son of Buzz Lagos, an American soccer coach at both the college and professional levels, and the youngest of eight children.

<doc id="1161609" wikidata="Q1753779" url="?curid=1161609" title="The Will to Death">
<text>The Will to Death is the fifth studio album by American musician John Frusciante, released on June 22, 2004 on Record Collection. The album reached #36 on the Top Independent Albums chart.

The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album.

Frequent collaborator Josh Klinghoffer appears, performing drums, bass, guitar, and keyboard.

The album cover is a photo taken on Cimitero Monumentale di Milano. The man is Luigi Ontani.

==Background and recording==
In 2004 Frusciante announced that he would produce six albums during a six-month break from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, with &quot;The Will to Death&quot; being the first of these. Following the long and costly recording of his previous album, &quot;Shadows Collide with People&quot;, Frusciante decided to experiment with recording music quickly and in a minimalist fashion, performing a maximum of two takes per track.

Frusciante has stated that the album is intended to be &quot;the opposite of &quot;Shadows Collide with People&quot;&quot;: 

On January 16, 2013, John provided a definition and theory of &quot;The Will to Death&quot; on his website.

<doc id="1161612" wikidata="Q926159" url="?curid=1161612" title="Francis Masson">
<text>Francis Masson (August 1741 – 23 December 1805) was a Scottish botanist and gardener, and Kew Gardens’ first plant hunter.

==Life==
Masson was born in Aberdeen.

In the 1760s, he went to work at Kew Gardens as an under-gardener. 
Masson was the first plant collector to be sent abroad by the newly appointed director Sir Joseph Banks; he sailed with James Cook on HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; to South Africa, landing in October 1772. 
Masson stayed until 1775, during which time he sent back to England over 500 species of plant.

In 1776, Banks sent Masson abroad again, this time to Madeira, Canary Islands, the Azores and the Antilles. 
Whilst in Grenada, Masson was captured and imprisoned by the French, a traumatic experience which haunted him for the rest of his life. Although he was eventually released, his collections deteriorated during the delay in securing a passage home, and a hurricane in St. Lucia destroyed almost all of what little had survived. Returning to Kew, Masson found the gardening life tedious by comparison, and again turned to Banks for another opportunity to collect abroad. However, the war with France had made such ventures increasingly difficult.

In 1783, Masson collected plants in Portugal, and in October 1785, he left England on his second voyage to South Africa. The political climate there had altered much since his first visit, owing to the attempt by a British expeditionary force to annex the Cape in 1781. The restrictions imposed on his movements by the Governor caused Masson considerable frustration, and when he sailed for England in March 1795, his plant collections bore little comparison with those of his triumphant first expedition.

In September 1797, Masson set sail for North America. The voyage was particularly perilous, his ship captured by a French pirate. Anticipating execution, Masson and his fellow travellers were much relieved to find themselves transferred to a German vessel bound for Baltimore, whence he was able to secure a passage to New York City, arriving in December. During the next seven years he travelled widely collecting plants and seeds, visiting Niagara Peninsula and Lake Ontario, but amassed only 24 new species, a minuscule tally compared with his South African spoils.

==Death==
Masson was unsuited to the harsh winters of North America. He died after a short illness in Montreal on 23 December 1805, and was buried there at the Scotch Presbyterian Church (later known as the St. Gabriel Street Church) on Christmas Day.

==Legacy==
Masson described in excess of 1,700 new species including:
==Publications==
Masson’s only book, &quot;Stapeliae Novae&quot;, on the South African succulents also known as &quot;carrion-flowers&quot; because of their smell, was published in 1796.

==Eponymy==
The genus of plants &quot;Massonia&quot; is named for Masson. There is a commemorative plaque to Masson in the Cruickshank Botanic Garden, Old Aberdeen.

<text>Crystal Reports is a business intelligence application marketed to small- and medium-sized businesses by SAP.

==History==
Terry Cunningham and the Cunningham Group originated the software in 1984. Crystal Services Inc. marketed the product (originally called &quot;Quik Reports&quot;) when they could not find a suitable commercial report writer for an accounting software they developed add-on products for, which was ACCPAC Plus for DOS (later acquired by Sage). After producing versions 1.0 through 3.0, Crystal Services was acquired by Seagate Technology in 1994. Crystal Services was combined with Holistic Systems to form the Information Management Group of Seagate Software, which later rebranded as Crystal Decisions and produced versions 4.0 through 9.0. Crystal Decisions was acquired in December 2003 by BusinessObjects, which produced versions 10, 11 (XI) and version 12 (2008).

SAP acquired BusinessObjects on October 8, 2007, and released Crystal Reports 2011 (version 14) on May 3, 2011. The latest version released is Crystal Reports 2020 (14.3.x) on June 13, 2020.

The file extension for Crystal Reports&#x27; proprietary file format is .rpt. The design file can be saved without data, or with data for later viewing or sharing. Introduced with the release of Crystal Reports 2011 (version 14.0), the read-only .rptr file extension option allows for viewing, but cannot be modified once exported.

Several other applications, including Microsoft Visual Studio versions 2003 through 2008, and Borland Delphi, at one time bundled an OEM version of Crystal Reports as a general purpose reporting tool. Microsoft discontinued this practice and later released their own competing reporting tool, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).

<doc id="1161621" wikidata="Q33918" url="?curid=1161621" title="Ludic language">
<text>Ludic, Ludian, or Ludic Karelian ( or ), is a Finnic language in the Uralic language family or a Karelian dialect. It is transitional between the Olonets Karelian language and the Veps language. It is spoken by 300 Karelians in the Republic of Karelia in Russia, near the southwestern shore of Lake Onega, including a few children.

==Classification==

In the Finnish research tradition, Ludic has been considered a transitional dialect area between Karelian and Veps, while in the Russian research tradition it is, on ethnographic grounds, normally considered a dialect of Karelian. A status as an independent language has been proposed in recent times. Ludic is characterised by a specific mixture of Karelian-like traits (such as the diphthongisation of the Proto-Finnic non-open long vowels: e.g. *pää &gt; &quot;piä&quot; &#x27;head&#x27;, *soo &gt; &quot;suo&quot; &#x27;swamp&#x27;, contrast Veps &quot;pä&quot;, &quot;so&quot;) and Veps-like traits (such as an almost complete loss of consonant gradation). Like Veps, Ludic has also partially lost vowel harmony.

===Dialects===
Ludic comprises three main dialect groups:
* Ludic
** Northern (Lake) Ludic, at the northwestern shores of Lake Onega
** Central (River) Ludic, at settlements along river Shuya and near the city of Petrozavodsk
** Kuďäŕv (Forest) Ludic, in the Mikhaylovskoye rural locality
The strongest Karelian resemblance is found in Northern Ludic, while the Kuďäŕv dialect shares the most features with Veps.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
* Vowel length may also be distinctive.

=== Consonants ===
* Sounds only occur in recent borrowings.
* can also be heard as a velar .
* is heard as velar when preceding velar consonants.
* can be lenited as a fricative in intervocalic positions.

== Writing system ==
Ludic is written using the unified Karelian alphabet, but in some publications the letter Ü is used instead of Y, as in Veps.

== Phrases ==
* = Who are you?
* = What is this?
* = Which one of you is Onni?
* = Why are you laughing?
* = What time is it?
* = When are they coming home?
* = He/She leaves tomorrow.

<text>Crystal Decisions (previously known as &quot;Seagate Software Information Management Group&quot;) was a company that was known for its business intelligence products.

The company was formed when hard disk drive manufacturer Seagate Technology acquired Holistic Systems and Crystal Services with the intention of pursuing better profit margins in the software market. Holistic Systems had a wide range of sales offices, infrastructure and the Holos OLAP product, whilst Crystal Services had good OEM deals for the Crystal Reports database reporting product that they had written. The first new product from the combined company was Seagate Info, which later evolved to become known as Crystal Enterprise. Crystal Analysis followed as an OLAP client.

The company&#x27;s structure reflected its heritage, with OLAP technologies being developed out of the former Holistic Systems R&amp;D site in Ipswich, Suffolk, England and Relational Database technologies being developed out of the former Crystal Services R&amp;D centre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Crystal Decisions was acquired by Business Objects in December 2003. As part of this acquisition, the former research and development site in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, was closed with a loss of about 80 jobs in order to centralize development in Vancouver and Paris, with the support for the Holos product being outsourced to Raspberry Software based near Ipswich.

The Holos product line has now ceased.

Business Objects was purchased by SAP in March 2008.

<doc id="1161627" wikidata="Q932190" url="?curid=1161627" title="Ludo Martens">
<text>Ludo Martens (12 March 1946 – 5 June 2011) was a Belgian activist who founded and served as the first leader of the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium. He wrote several works on the political history of Central Africa and the Soviet Union.

In 1968, Martens founded the group &quot;Alle macht aan de arbeiders&quot; (All Power to the Workers), which became the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium in 1979. He served as president of the Workers&#x27; Party until 2008. Martens was the last foreigner to meet North Korean president Kim Il Sung before his death on 8 July 1994. According to a press release by the Workers&#x27; Party, Martens died on the morning of 5 June 2011 after a long illness.

== Biography ==

Martens was born in 1946, as the eldest son of a furniture manufacturer. He grew up in Wingene, West Flanders, Belgium. While at school, he showed talent in linguistics and became a newspaper editor. He also had an interest in music and poetry. In 1965, Ludo entered the Louvain University to study medicine and during that time he became active in the Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond. Ludo got expelled from his university after writing an article about pedophilia within the church on &quot;Our Life&quot;, the magazine which he ran in the university. He was influenced by the student movements in 1968. Having visited Berlin, where he came into contact with Marxist–Leninist German students, he introduced the thought of Marxism into the Belgian student movement. In 1971, Ludo founded the &quot;Alle macht aan de arbeiders&quot; (AMADA) party, which renamed itself into the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium in 1979. He was the last communist leader to meet Kim Il Sung, two weeks before the latter&#x27;s death. Kim told Ludo: &quot;I think it is very good that you have written a book about Stalin. I intend to read it&quot;. In 1999, Ludo requested his party to relieve him of the post of party president, a position he had held since the founding of the party, as he wished to pursue his passion for work in the Congo. The request was granted. In nearly a decade, following 1999, he wrote his book on Laurent Kabila and the Congolese revolution, while at the same time helping to lay the foundations of a communist party in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ludo died on the afternoon of June 5, 2011 after a long illness.

== &quot;Another View of Stalin&quot; ==
In 1994, Martens published &quot;Another View of Stalin&quot; (&quot;&quot;), a work that holds an apologetic view of collectivisation in the Soviet Union and the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin. He explained his motivation for writing the book in the introduction: &quot;Defending Stalin&#x27;s work, essentially defending Marxism–Leninism, is an important, urgent task in preparing ourselves for class struggle under the New World Order.&quot; Martens referred to the notion of Stalinist crimes as a &#x27;myth&#x27; and claimed that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which the Soviet Union agreed to invade Poland in conjunction with Nazi Germany and divide Poland, Romania, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia between one another into respective &quot;spheres of influence&quot;, was &quot;a key for victory in the anti-fascist war&quot;. The leadership of the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium, particularly president Peter Mertens in 2016, distanced from Martens&#x27; vision on Stalin, whom they call &quot;a dictator.&quot; Harpal Brar wrote in Martens&#x27; obituary: &quot;His book &quot;Another view of Stalin&quot;, while nailing the bourgeois, professorial and Khrushchevite revisionist lies about Stalin, brought to the fore the brilliance of Stalin&#x27;s stewardship of the CPSU(B) and the USSR, which made such a monumental contribution to the march forward of the Soviet people and humanity at large&quot;.

<text>David Holmes is an American sportscaster and was also the winner of the second season of &quot;Dream Job&quot;, the ESPN reality television talent search show that looks for new on-air talent for the all-sports television network. A 22-year-old student at Kent State University who comes from Uniontown, Ohio, Holmes got onto the show by being one of the two Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card Winners (the other being K.C. James). It took Holmes a while to find his rhythm, but once he picked it up, he was nearly flawless, though he did stumble on occasions throughout the season. He came close to being cut in both episodes three and nine, but survived to take a not-so-easy win in the season&#x27;s tenth and final episode over Grant Thompson, who was almost as, if not more, solid than Holmes most of the time, but Thompson&#x27;s major stumbles in episode ten aided Holmes in his win.

Along with his one-year ESPN contract, Holmes made $70,000 in his first year, and was awarded with a brand-new Mazda6 5-door car. He started at ESPNews at the first of the year, but on observation to see how sportscasting outside the reality stage worked. His first on-air appearance did not take place until late February 2005. It was also on ESPNews, where he began to go by &quot;Dave.&quot;

==&quot;Dream Job&quot;==
At the time of &quot;Dream Job&quot;, Holmes stated he &quot;needs to pass one more online course to get his broadcast journalism degree&quot; from Kent State University. When Holmes won, Kent State declared Feb. 19 as Dave Holmes Day at Kent State and then introduced him at the ESPN Bracket Buster game in the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center.

Holmes did try out for the show&#x27;s first season, got to the semifinals of the competition, but was passed over for the televised finals for the Spring of 2004.

==Life after ESPN==
After ESPN, Dave went on to work at WTVG, the ABC affiliate in Toledo, OH, which he joined on April 2, 2007. He worked there as a sports reporter and anchor. He also served as the sports director at 13abc.

In the fall of 2015, Dave announced that he would be leaving 13abc in Toledo for WBNS in Columbus, OH. At the Columbus CBS affiliate, Dave serves as a sports reporter and weekend sports anchor. He also covers The Ohio State Buckeyes football team both at home and on the road.

<doc id="1161669" wikidata="Q639625" url="?curid=1161669" title="Rinzai school">
<text>The Rinzai school (, ), named after Linji Yixuan (Romaji: Rinzai Gigen, died 866 CE) is one of three sects of Zen in Japanese Buddhism, along with Sōtō and Ōbaku. The Chinese Linji school of Chan Buddhism was first transmitted to Japan by Myōan Eisai (1141 –1215). Contemporary Japanese Rinzai is derived entirely from the Ōtōkan lineage transmitted through Hakuin Ekaku (1686–1769), who is a major figure in the revival of the Rinzai tradition.

==History==

Rinzai is the Japanese line of the Chinese Linji school of Chan Buddhism, which was founded during the Tang dynasty by Linji Yixuan (Japanese: Rinzai Gigen).

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
Though there were several attempts to establish Rinzai lines in Japan, it first took root in a lasting way through the efforts of the monk Myōan Eisai. In 1168, Myōan Eisai traveled to China, where he studied Tendai for twenty years. In 1187, he went to China again, and returned to Japan to establish a Linji school of Chan Buddhism, which is known in Japan as Rinzai. Decades later, (1235–1308), who also studied Linji teachings in China, founded the Japanese Ōtōkan lineage, the most influential and only surviving branch of the Rinzai school of Zen.

Rinzai Zen was established in Japan as the samurai rose to power. Along with early imperial support, Rinzai came to enjoy the patronage of this newly ascendant warrior class.

===Muromachi (or Ashikaga) period (1336–1573)===
During the Muromachi period, the Rinzai school was the most successful of the Zen schools in Japan because it was favoured by the &quot;shōgun&quot;. The school may be said to have truly flowered and achieved a distinctly Japanese identity with Shūhō Myōchō (aka Daitō Kokushi 1283–1337) and Musō Soseki (1275–1351), two influential Japanese Zen masters who did not travel to China to study.

====Five Mountain System====

In the beginning of the Muromachi period, the system was fully worked out. The final version contained five temples of both Kyoto and Kamakura, presided over by Nanzen-ji. A second tier of the system consisted of Ten Temples. This system was extended throughout Japan, effectively giving control to the central government, which administered this system. The monks, often well educated and skilled, were employed by the &quot;shōgun&quot; for the governing of state affairs.

====Rinka-monasteries====
Not all Rinzai Zen organisations were under such strict state control. The Rinka monasteries, which were primarily located in rural areas rather than cities, had a greater degree of independence. The Ōtōkan lineage, which centered on Daitoku-ji, also had a greater degree of freedom. It was founded by Nanpo Shōmyō, Shūhō Myōchō, and Kanzan Egen. A well-known teacher from Daitoku-ji was Ikkyū.

Another Rinka lineage was the Hotto lineage, of which Bassui Tokushō is the best-known teacher.

===Tokugawa (1600–1868) - Hakuin and his heirs===
By the 18th century, the Rinzai school was challenged by the newly-imported Obaku-lineage, and by the waning of support from the ruling elites. Hakuin Ekaku (1686–1769), with his vigorous zeal for koan-practice and his orientation towards common people, became the hero of a revigorized tradition of koan-study and an outreach to a lay-audience, and most Rinzai lineages claim descent from him, though his engagement with formal Rinzai-institution was minimal. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of &quot;Dai-ichiza&quot;, &quot;First Monk&quot;:
Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shōju Rōnin (Dokyō Etan, 1642–1721), but never received formal dharma transmission from him. Nevertheless, through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are considered part of the Ōtōkan lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by Nanpo Jomyo, who received his dharma transmission in China in 1265.

Tōrei Enji (1721–1792), who had studied with Kogetsu Zenzai, was a major student of Hakuin and an influential author, painter and calligrapher. He is the author of the influential &quot;The Undying Lamp of Zen&quot; (&quot;Shūmon mujintō ron&quot;), which presents a comprehensive system of Rinzai training.

Through Torei&#x27;s student Gasan Jitō (1727–1797) Hakuin&#x27;s approach became a focal point in Japanese Rinzai Zen. Before meeting Hakuin, Gasan received Dharma transmission from Rinzai teacher Gessen Zen&#x27;e, who had received dharma transmission from Kogetsu Zenzai. Gasan is often considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, despite the fact that &quot;he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin&#x27;s dharma heirs.&quot; Gasan&#x27;s students Inzan Ien (1751–1814), who also studied with Gessen Zen&#x27;e, and Takujū Kosen (1760–1833) created a systematized way of koan-study, with fixed questions and answers. In 1808 Inzan Ien became abbott of Myoshin-ji, one of the main Rinzai temples in Japan, where he served for a short time, while Takujū Kosen was appointed as head abbott of Myoshin-ji in 1813. All contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages, and their methods and styles of koan-study, stem from these two teachers, though at the end of the Tokugawa-periond his line was at the brink of extinction.

===Meiji Restoration (1868–1912) and Imperial Expansionism (1912–1945)===
During the Meiji period (1868–1912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism. Shinto became the state religion, and Buddhism adapted to the new regime. Within the Buddhist establishment the Western world was seen as a threat, but also as a challenge to stand up to.

A Rinzai university was founded in 1872, Hanazono University, initially as a seminary for those entering the priesthood. Hanazono University has grown to become the major Rinzai higher education institution in Japan.

===Post-war (1945–present)===
Modern Rinzai Zen is made up of 15 sects or branches, the largest being the Myoshin-ji line. 

Some influential modern Rinzai figures include Ōmori Sōgen (大森 曹玄, 1904–1994), Sōkō Morinaga (盛永 宗興, 1925–1995), Shodo Harada (原田 正道), Eshin Nishimura (西村 惠信; born 1933), Keidō Fukushima (福島 慶道, 1933 – 2011) and D.T. Suzuki (鈴木 大拙 貞太郎, 1870–1966).

== Literary sources ==

Rinzai is a Mahayana Buddhist tradition that draws from the various Indian Mahayana sutras (like the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot;) and shastras (treatises) of the Indian masters. Rinzai also closely follows the works of the Chinese Chan tradition, particularly that of the masters of the Linji school like Linji Yixuan (d. 866) and Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) and various traditional records of that school, like the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp,&quot; and the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; (臨濟語錄; Jp: &quot;Rinzai-goroku&quot;, &quot;the Record of Linji&quot;)&quot;.&quot; 

Important Japanese sources of the Rinzai school include the works of Hakuin Ekaku and his student Tōrei Enji. Torei&#x27;s &quot;Undying Lamp of Zen&quot; (&quot;Shūmon mujintō ron&quot;) offers a comprehensive overview of Hakuin&#x27;s Zen and is a major source for Rinzai Zen practice. A more modern overview of Japanese Rinzai praxis is Omori Sogen&#x27;s &quot;Sanzen Nyumon (An Introduction to Zen Training).&quot;

==Japanese Rinzai practice==


Contemporary Japanese Rinzai Zen is marked by its emphasis on &quot;kenshō&quot; (見性, &quot;seeing one&#x27;s/ self nature&quot; or &quot;to see clearly into the buddha-nature&quot;) as the gateway to authentic Buddhist practice. Rinzai also stresses the importance of post-kensho spiritual training that actualizes awakening for the benefit of all beings. 

The student&#x27;s relationship with a Zen teacher is another central element of Rinzai Zen practice. This includes the formal practice of &quot;sanzen&quot;, a private interview between student and master and various methods of &quot;direct pointing&quot; that are used by Rinzai masters to guide the student to the experience of kensho.

Formal Rinzai training focuses on zazen (seated meditation). Practices such as different forms of breath meditation (breath counting, diaphragmatic breathing and tanden, breath cultivation), kōan introspection, wato, and mantra practice (such as using the mantric syllable Ah) are used in zazen. Other practices include walking meditation (Jp. &quot;kinhin&quot;), ōryōki (a meditative meal practice), and samu (physical work done with mindfulness). Chanting (&quot;okyo&quot;) Buddhist sutras or dharanis is also a major element of Rinzai practice.

Kōans are a common object of meditation when engaged in formal zazen. &quot;Shikantaza&quot; (&quot;just sitting&quot;) is less emphasized in Rinzai, but still used. This contrasts with Sōtō practice, which has de-emphasized kōans since Gentō Sokuchū (circa 1800), and instead emphasizes shikantaza.

The Rinzai school developed its own formalized style of &quot;kōan&quot; introspection and training. This includes a standardized curriculum of &quot;kōans&quot;, which must be studied and &quot;passed&quot; in sequence. This process may include standardized questions (&quot;sassho&quot;) and common sets of &quot;capping phrases&quot; (&quot;jakugo&quot;) or poetry citations that are memorized by students as answers. A student&#x27;s understanding of a kōan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (&quot;dokusan&quot;, &quot;daisan&quot;, or &quot;sanzen&quot;) and the teacher&#x27;s job is to guide the student to kensho, in part by judging the student&#x27;s &quot;kyōgai&quot;. Kōan-inquiry may be practiced during &quot;zazen&quot; (sitting meditation)&quot;, kinhin&quot; (walking meditation), and throughout all daily activities.

In general, the Rinzai school is known for the rigor and severity of its training methods. The Rinzai style may be characterized as somewhat martial or sharp (following in the spirit of Linji Yixuan). Since the adoption of Rinzai Zen by the Hōjō clan in the 13th century, some Rinzai figures have even developed the samurai arts (&quot;budō&quot;) within a Zen framework. One influential figure was the Rinzai priest Takuan Sōhō who was well known for his writings on Zen and &quot;budō&quot; addressed to the samurai class (see &quot;The Unfettered Mind&quot;). In this regard, Rinzai is often contrasted with another sect of Zen deeply established in Japan, Sōtō, which has been called more gentle and even rustic in spirit. A Japanese saying reflects these perceptions: &quot;Rinzai for the Shōgun, Sōtō for the peasants&quot; (臨済将軍、曹洞土民, &quot;Rinzai Shōgun, Sōtō Domin&quot;).

The Rinzai school also adopted certain Taoist energy cultivation practices. They were introduced by Hakuin (1686–1769) who learned them from a hermit named Hakuyu. These energetic practices are called &quot;naikan.&quot; They are mainly based on focusing the mind and one&#x27;s vital energy (&quot;ki&quot;) on the &quot;tanden&quot; (a spot slightly below the navel).

Certain Japanese arts such as painting, calligraphy, poetry, gardening, and the tea ceremony are also often used as methods of Zen cultivation in Rinzai. Hakuin is famously known for his &quot;sumi-e&quot; (ink and wash) paintings as well as for his calligraphy. Myōan Eisai is said to have popularized green tea in Japan and the famed master of Japanese tea, Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591), was also trained in Rinzai.

==Contemporary Rinzai schools==
Rinzai Zen in Japan today is not a single organized body. Rather, it is divided into 15 branches (or 16, if Ōbaku is included), referred to by the names of their head temples, of which half are based in Kyoto (8, plus Ōbaku). The largest and most influential of these is the Myōshin-ji branch, whose head temple was founded in 1342 by Kanzan Egen (1277–1360). Other major branches include Nanzen-ji and Tenryū-ji (both founded by Musō Soseki), Daitoku-ji (founded by Shūhō Myōchō), and Tōfuku-ji (founded by Enni Ben&#x27;en, 1202–1280). These branches are purely organizational divisions arising from temple history and teacher-student lineage, and do not represent sectarian divides or fundamental differences in practice. There are nevertheless small differences in the way kōans are handled.

These head temples preside over various networks, comprising a total of approximately six thousand temples, forty monasteries, and one nunnery. The Myōshin-ji branch is by far the largest, approximately as big as the other branches combined: it contains within it about three thousand five hundred temples and nineteen monasteries.

===Japanese Rinzai schools===
The 15 branches of Rinzai, by head temple, are:

* Kennin-ji (1202)
* Tōfuku-ji (1236, founded by Enni Ben&#x27;en, 1202–1280)
* Kenchō-ji (1253)
* Engaku-ji (1282)
* Nanzen-ji (1291, founded by Musō Soseki)
* Kokutai-ji (1300)
* Daitoku-ji (1315, founded by Shūhō Myōchō)
* Kōgaku-ji (1380)
* Myōshin-ji (sect founded 1337, temple founded in 1342 by Kanzan Egen)
* Tenryū-ji (1339, founded by Musō Soseki)
* Eigen-ji (1361)
* Hōkō-ji (1384)
* Shōkoku-ji (1392)
* Buttsū-ji (1397, affiliated with Tenryū-ji until 1905)
* Kōshō-ji (1603)

===Western Rinzai===

A number of Rinzai lines have been transplanted from Japan to Europe, the Americas, and Australia, and non-Japanese practitioners have been certified as teachers and successors of those lineages. Rinzai temples, as well as practice groups led by lay practitioners, may now be found in many nations.

North American Rinzai centers include Rinzai-ji founded by Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi and the Pacific Zen Institute founded by John Tarrant Roshi in California, Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji established by Eido Shimano Roshi and Soen Nakagawa Roshi in New York, Chozen-ji founded by Omori Sogen Roshi in Hawaii, Daiyuzenji in Illinois and Korinji in Wisconsin both founded by dharma heirs in Omori Sogen Roshi&#x27;s line, and Chobo-Ji founded by Genki Takabayashi Rōshi in Seattle, Washington. In Europe there is Havredal Zendo established by a Dharma Heir of Eido Shimano, Egmund Sommer (Denko Mortensen).

==Related Japanese Zen schools==
=== Obaku ===

Aside from Rinzai and Sōtō, there is a third tradition of Zen present in Japan, the Ōbaku Zen sect. It was brought to Japan in the 17th century, and shows significant influence from the Pure Land school. This reflects the syncretistic tendencies that developed in Chinese Buddhism in the centuries after the earlier Rinzai lines had been transmitted to Japan.

Ōbaku is also descended from the Chinese Linji school, and so technically may be considered a part of the Japanese Rinzai movement; further, its abbots are now part of the same Ōtōkan lineage as Rinzai branches, though they were not so originally (instead following a more recent Chinese lineage). While Manpuku-ji, the Ōbaku headquarters temple, is considered one of the 15 Rinzai branches mentioned above, Ōbaku Zen is administratively separate from the other 14 branches and continues to maintain its own distinct identity.

=== Fuke ===
A final Japanese Zen sect that self-identified as descending from the Linji school was the Fuke sect; Fuke Zen was suppressed with the Meiji Restoration in the 19th century and no longer exists. Its influence on the development of music for the shakuhachi (bamboo flute), however, has been great.

=== Ichibata Yakushi Kyodan ===

Ichibata Yakushi Kyodan (properly written Ichiba Yakushi Kyōdan 一畑薬師教団) is today generally considered an independent school of Buddhism, though it was previously associated with Myōshin-ji (and before that Tendai), and may still be considered part of Rinzai, though its practices and beliefs have little in common with Rinzai. It places great importance in faith in Yakushi (Medicine Buddha), and is known as a destination for healing.

==Cultural influence==
Remarkable results of the early relationship between Rinzai Zen and the ruling classes were a strong Rinzai influence on education and government, and Rinzai contributions to a great flowering of Japanese cultural arts such as calligraphy, painting, literature, tea ceremony, Japanese garden design, architecture and even martial arts. A perhaps unanticipated result is that Soto Zen temples, with their connection and appeal to commoners, eventually came to outnumber Rinzai temples.

<text>The Edge Hill Light Railway, one of Colonel Stephens&#x27; light railways, was in Warwickshire, England. It was designed to carry ironstone from Edge Hill Quarries to Burton Dassett where a junction was made with the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway. It was never officially opened, but began operating in 1922.

In the middle of the line, there was a cable-worked incline at 1 in 6 (16%). As the quarry was at the top of the incline, the incline could be worked as self-acting: the weight of full ore wagons descending was sufficient to draw the empties back up.

Within three years it was found that the iron ore deposits were uneconomic, and the line ceased operating in 1925. It was not dismantled until 1946. A caretaker was employed until the late 1930s in the possibility that the line could be re-opened. In 1942, permanent way from the lower portion of the line was requisitioned for the construction of the army depot now known as MoD Kineton. This had the effect of isolating the line, and the remaining stock at the top of the incline, from the main line and so they survived there until 1946.

<doc id="1161691" wikidata="Q2342373" url="?curid=1161691" title="Classical ballet">
<text>Classical ballet is any of the traditional, formal styles of ballet that exclusively employ classical ballet technique. It is known for its aesthetics and rigorous technique (such as pointe work, turnout of the legs, and high extensions), its flowing, precise movements, and its ethereal qualities.

There are stylistic variations related to an area or origin, which are denoted by classifications such as Russian ballet, French ballet, British ballet and Italian ballet. For example, Russian ballet features high extensions and dynamic turns, whereas Italian ballet tends to be more grounded, with a focus on fast, intricate footwork. Many of the stylistic variations are associated with specific training methods that have been named after their originators. Despite these variations, the performance and vocabulary of classical ballet are largely consistent throughout the world.

== History ==
Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts and was brought to France by Catherine de&#x27; Medici in the 16th century. During ballet&#x27;s infancy, court ballets were performed by aristocratic amateurs rather than professional dancers. Most of ballet&#x27;s early movements evolved from social court dances and prominently featured stage patterns rather than formal ballet technique.

In the 17th century, as ballet&#x27;s popularity in France increased, ballet began to gradually transform into a professional art. It was no longer performed by amateurs, but instead ballet performances started to incorporate challenging acrobatic movements that could only be performed by highly skilled street entertainers. In response, the world&#x27;s first ballet school, the Académie Royale de Danse, was established by King Louis XIV in 1661. The Academie&#x27;s purpose was to improve the quality of dance training in France and to invent a technique or curriculum that could be used to transform ballet into a formal discipline. Shortly after the Academie was formed, in 1672, King Louis XIV established a performing company called the Academie Royal de Musique de Dance (today known as Paris Opera), and named Pierre Beauchamp the head dancing-master. While at the Academie Royal, Beauchamp revolutionized ballet technique by inventing the five positions (first, second, third, fourth and fifth) of ballet, which to this day remain the foundation of all formal classical ballet technique.

==Development==

Before classical ballet developed, ballet was in a period referred to as the Romantic era. Romantic ballet was known for its storytelling, and often held a softer aesthetic. Classical ballet came to be when a ballet master by the name of Marius Petipa (who is considered to be one of the greatest choreographers of all time) took Romantic ballet and combined it with different aspects of Russian ballet technique (as Petipa was once a choreographer and ballet master at Mariinsky Ballet). Elements pulled from these things include the storytelling found in Romantic ballet, and the athleticism of Russian technique. Therefore, a new era of ballet, which later became known as the classical era, began. Even though he was responsible for bringing in the classical ballet era, Petipa was also responsible for choreographing well-known romantic ballets such as &quot;Giselle&quot;.

During the classical era, Marius Petipa was largely responsible for creating choreographic structures that are still used in ballets today. For one, Petipa was the first to use the grand pas de deux in his choreography. Additionally, he cemented the usage of the corps de ballet as a standard part of a ballet. Despite his ushering in of the classical era, these elements can be seen in his romantic ballets as well.

===Famous classical ballets===

* &quot;Swan Lake&quot;: choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov
* &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;: choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov

==Technique==
Ballet technique is the foundational principles of body movement and form used in ballet. A distinctive feature of ballet technique is &quot;turnout;&quot; which is the outward rotation of the legs and feet emanating from the hip. This was first introduced into ballet by King Louis XIV because he loved to show off the shiny buckles on his shoes when he performed his own dances. There are five fundamental positions of the feet in ballet, all performed with turnout and named numerically as &quot;first&quot; through &quot;fifth&quot; positions. When performing jumps and leaps, classical ballet dancers strive to exhibit &quot;ballon&quot;, the appearance of briefly floating in the air. &quot;Pointe technique&quot; is the part of ballet technique that concerns &quot;pointe work&quot;, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet on specially designed and handcrafted &quot;pointe shoes&quot;. In professional companies, the shoes are made to fit the dancers&#x27; feet perfectly.

==Training==

Students typically learn ballet terminology and the pronunciation, meaning, and precise body form and movement associated with each term. Emphasis is placed on developing flexibility and strengthening the legs, feet, and body core (the &quot;center&quot;, or abdominals) as a strong core is essential for turns and many other ballet movements. Dancers also learn to use their &quot;spot&quot; which teaches them to focus on something while turning so as not to become dizzy and lose their balance.

Early ballet training for all dancers involves basic technique and develops strength and flexibility. As they progress, female dancers begin to learn pointe technique and both male and female dancers begin to learn partnering and more advanced jumps and turns. As the men get stronger, lifts are added to the partnering. Depending on the teacher and training system, students may progress through various stages or levels of training as their skills advance.

===Music for ballet class===

The traditional ballet masters of the eighteenth century played the violin for their own ballet classes. They also provided their ballet students with instruction in the relationship between the dance steps and the music. By the end of the nineteenth century this had fallen out of fashion, and specialisation in the performing arts meant that the role of the ballet teacher and the ballet musician had become separate professions. By the twentieth century, the violin had given way to the piano as the standard accompaniment for ballet class. When recorded music is substituted for a live musician, there is no opportunity for the dancers to make subtle physical shifts of expression that a live dance accompanist will watch and match as they play.

The live musician in a ballet class plays a crucial role in the creative process. As the ballet teacher sets an exercise - moving, counting, vocalising - the musician observes and imagines the music that will best support the exercise. The musician then plays either an existing piece of musical repertoire or creates a musical improvisation to support the dancers in the exercise. The dancers are affected by the musician&#x27;s choices, and they integrate both the ballet teacher&#x27;s steps and the ballet musician&#x27;s music into their performance. Ultimately, the ballet teacher has little control over the musical portion of their lesson unless they ask the musician to play a specific piece of music. For this reason, the working relationship between a dance teacher and a dance musician is vital to the success of a ballet class.

===Ballet class attire===

Female attire typically includes pink or flesh colored tights, a leotard, and sometimes a short wrap-skirt, or a skirted leotard and sometimes legwarmers depending on the season. Males typically wear black or dark tights, a form-fitting white, or black, shirt or leotard worn under the tights, and a dance belt beneath the outer dancewear to provide support. In some cases, students may wear a unitard — a one-piece garment that combines tights and a leotard — to enhance the visibility of artistic lines.

All dancers wear soft ballet shoes (sometimes called &quot;flats&quot;). Typically, female dancers wear pink or beige shoes and men wear black or white shoes. Leg warmers are sometimes worn during the early part of a class to protect leg muscles until they become warm. Females are usually required to restrain their hair in a bun or some other hair style that exposes the neck that is not a ponytail. The customary attire and hair style are intended to promote freedom of movement and to reveal body form so that the teacher can evaluate dancers&#x27; alignment and technique. After warming up, advanced female students may wear pointe shoes whereas advanced male students continue to wear soft shoes. Pointe shoes are worn after the student is deemed strong enough in the ankles and can execute the routine to a high standard, usually around or after the age of 12, or after the dancers&#x27; feet have stopped developing, so as to protect the dancers&#x27; feet from injury common with premature wearing.

===Methods===

There are several standardized, widespread, classical ballet training systems, each designed to produce a unique aesthetic quality from its students. Some systems are named after their creators; these are typically called &quot; methods&quot; or &quot;schools&quot;. For example, two prevailing systems from Russia are the Vaganova method (created by Agrippina Vaganova) and the Legat Method (by Nikolai Legat). The Cecchetti method is named after Italian dancer Enrico Cecchetti. Another training system was developed by and named after August Bournonville; this is taught primarily in Denmark. The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) method was not created by an individual, but by a group of notable ballet professionals. Despite their associations with geographically named ballet styles, many of these training methods are used worldwide. For example, the RAD teaching method is used in more than 70 countries.

American-style ballet (Balanchine) is not taught by means of a standardized, widespread training system. Similarly, French ballet has no standard training system; each of the major French-style ballet schools, such as the Paris Opera Ballet School, Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse, and Académie de Danse Classique Princesse Grace (Monaco) employs a unique training system.

====Stage reference points====

Some classical ballet training systems employ standardized layouts to define reference locations at the corners, and edges of stages, and dance studio rooms. In the latter case, there is no audience and a mirror typically spans the downstage wall of the room (e.g., points 1-2 of the Cecchetti layout).

<text>William Marshall (or William Leonard Marshall) (1944–2003) was an Australian author, best known for his Hong Kong–based &quot;Yellowthread Street&quot; mystery novels, some of which were used as the basis for a British TV series.

==Career==
William Marshall worked as a playwright, journalist, proofreader, and morgue attendant and was a teacher in an Irish prison. He was also the author of several series of police novels set across the globe and in various centuries.
Born in Sydney, Australia in 1944, he lived in Hong Kong, Switzerland, Wales, Ireland, and USA, before returning to Australia in 1983 with his wife and daughter. He died in 2003.

In the Yellowthread Street series, the detectives of the Yellowthread Street police station in fictitious Hong Bay, Hong Kong – DCI Harry Feiffer, a European born and raised in Hong Kong; Senior Inspector Christopher O&#x27;Yee, half-Chinese, half-Irish American, and all neurotic; and the ever-bickering team of Inspectors Auden and Spencer – attempt to find the rational basis for inexplicable and seemingly bizarre crimes. The Yellowthread novels show the influence of Ed McBain in their overlapping plot-lines, snappy dialogue, world-weary detectives and often difficult civilians.

Marshall&#x27;s novels manage to juggle violence, suspense, and slapstick humor in his twist on the police procedural form. He has also written two mystery series based in Manila and late-19th-century New York City, the latter featuring City Detective Virgil Tillman – New York City&#x27;s &quot;first thinking detective&quot; – and his partner, patrolman Ned Muldoon of the Strong Arm Squad.

<text>Felissa Rose Esposito (born May 23, 1969), better known as simply Felissa Rose, is an American actress and producer. Rose has amassed over 150 film credits, and is best known for her work in the horror genre, for which she is recognized as a &quot;scream queen&quot;.

Rose made her film debut as Angela Baker in the cult horror film &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983), which established her as a horror icon. She reprised the role in the 2008 sequel &quot;Return to Sleepaway Camp&quot;. Her other horror roles include Elsa Lansing in &quot;Silent Night, Zombie Night&quot; (2009), Mother in &quot;The Perfect House&quot; (2012), Rachel Steele in &quot;Camp Dread&quot; (2014), Angela Freeman in &quot;Death House&quot; (2018), Kathleen in &quot;Victor Crowley&quot; (2018), Ms. Crowell in &quot;Bloody Summer Camp&quot; (2022), and Ms. Principe in &quot;Terrifier 2&quot; (2022). Rose continues to make regular appearances on &quot;The Joe Bob Briggs Show&quot;, &quot;The Last Drive-In&quot; on Shudder, and appeared in The Boulet Brothers&#x27;s &quot;Halfway to Halloween&quot; special in 2023.

In 2016, Rose produced a number of music videos for the metal band Slayer.

==Early life==
Felissa Rose Esposito was born on May 23, 1969 in Greenwich Village in New York City and raised in Syosset on Long Island. Rose graduated from Syosset High School and later earned a degree from New York University.

==Career==
Rose made her debut film appearance in the 1983 horror film &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;, in which she plays Angela Baker. She later said of the film, &quot;It was such a big part of my childhood. It&#x27;s really hard to look at it objectively. On opening night I went to the theater with all my friends and watched it for the first time with a public audience. It was the best feeling. The energy in the theater was intense. People were really freaked out by the ending. I felt really good about the film.&quot;

After appearing in &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;, she made some more sporadic appearances in a few films and television series, including the 1993 romantic comedy film &quot;The Night We Never Met&quot; and an episode of the short-lived 1998 television series &quot;Prey&quot;. In 1999, she was contacted by Jeff Hayes, who operates the official &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; website, via a letter in the mail asking her to do an interview for the website and gauge her interest in doing a new &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; sequel. Shortly thereafter, Hayes met with Rose in New York.

She has since returned to cinema and has appeared in such films as &quot;Zombiegeddon&quot; (2003), &quot;Nikos&quot; (2003), and &quot;Sludge&quot; (2005). She has also appeared in two films by New Jersey filmmaker Dante Tomaselli: &quot;Horror&quot; (2002) and &quot;Satan&#x27;s Playground&quot; (2005). In addition Felissa co-hosted the 2005 Village Halloween Parade in New York City with fellow scream queens Debbie Rochon and Raine Brown. She also had a cameo role in the sequel to the 2008 &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; sequel &quot;Return to Sleepaway Camp&quot;. In the sequel, she reprises the role of Angela Baker. The movie had a straight to DVD release on November 4, 2008. She also appears in &quot;Hotdog Casserole&quot;, written and directed by Chris Raab, as the mother in a dysfunctional family. Rose starred in a role as Mother in the segment &quot;Dinner Guest&quot; in the anthology horror film, &quot;The Perfect House&quot;. She also portrayed forensic pathologist Amy Short in the thriller &quot;Poe&quot;.

In 2016, Felissa starred in the paranormal horror film &quot;Family Possessions&quot;, written and directed by Tommy Faircloth. The film also starred Mark Patton. In May 2017, she helped produce and acted in the horror film &quot;Death House&quot;. That same year, she appeared in &quot;Victor Crowley&quot;. In November 2022, Rose worked with Shelley Duvall on the film &quot;The Forest Hills&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rose lives in California with her husband, former CKY singer/guitarist Deron Miller, and their two daughters, Bianca Rose (born 2005) and Lola Marue (born 2007), and son Thomas Carver (born 2009). Rose and Miller were co-stars in Dave Campfield&#x27;s 2008 horror comedy &quot;Caesar and Otto&#x27;s Summer Camp Massacre&quot;.

<doc id="1161711" wikidata="Q939151" url="?curid=1161711" title="Timbiriche">
<text>Timbiriche (also known for a brief time as La Banda Timbiriche) was a Mexican pop music group. The group started as a children&#x27;s group in 1981 and managed to evolve successfully into adulthood.

Timbiriche is considered one of the most iconic Latin Pop acts of the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was the start of numerous figures in the Latin American entertainment world, including successful singers like Thalía, Paulina Rubio and Edith Márquez, as well as actors, composers and conductors.

The discography of the band consists of twelve studio albums released between 1982 and 1993, in addition to two compilation albums and two discs recorded live. Timbiriche is considered one of the most popular Latin Pop bands of all time. They have met in three successful reunions. The first occurred in 1998, the second in 2007 celebrating 25 years since the foundation of the band and the third one in 2017, celebrated by a sold out tour.

The band have also starred in a documentary directed by Carlos Marcovich entitled &quot;La Misma Piedra&quot; that followed step by step the band&#x27;s adventures in the preparation of the tours, concerts and behind the scenes of its 25th anniversary. In 2007, Televisa also produced a reality show whose objective was to integrate a new lineup for the band. 

In 2023, La Nueva Banda Timbiriche (composed of winners from the 2007 Televisa reality competition) reunited for a series of concerts throughout Mexico as part of the El 2000&#x27;s Pop Tour. Six of the seven original members returned to the band, excluding Alberto Dogre, who is no longer a public figure. The success of the initial tour led to a second leg of shows in Mexico scheduled for 2024. 

==History==
===Name===
Timbiriche (known in the United States as dots and boxes), is a paper-and-pencil game of mathematical structure. The objective of the game is to complete squares using points, and thus claim as many of these as possible on paper. The idea of naming the musical group comes in response to the Spanish children&#x27;s musical group Parchís, whose name is also inspired by a table game.

===Origin===
The idea of forming the musical group goes back to the founding of the children&#x27;s area of the Centro de Educación Artística (CEA) of the Mexican television network Televisa. The responsibility of recruiting a group of children for the ranks of the school was in charge of the Mexican actress and producer Martha Zavaleta. The children chosen to join the institution were Mariana Garza, Alix Bauer, Paulina Rubio and Diego Schoening. They were eventually joined by Benny Ibarra and Sasha Sokol. The group of children were trained in singing, dancing and acting in the institution. Eventually they staged a play. It was thanks to this work that the executives of Televisa had the idea of forming a children&#x27;s musical group with the six children.
At that time, the Spanish musical group Parchís caused a sensation in Mexico and several countries of Spanish Speaking. Televisa formed Timbiriche as a Mexican response to Parchís. The creative team in charge of launching this group was formed by Victor Hugo O&#x27;Farril, former partner, producer and creative director of the television station, and by producer Luis de Llano Macedo. María Eugenia &quot;La Gorda&quot; Galindo, was selected as manager of the group.

===Children&#x27;s Band (1982-1984)===
After a few months of preparation, Timbiriche made its official debut on 30 April 1982 on the Mexican television show &quot;Siempre en Domingo&quot;, featuring Spanish singer Miguel Bosé as its godfather. The group launches their first record production titled &quot;Timbiriche&quot;, which included the hit singles &quot;Amor para tí&quot;, &quot;Hoy tengo que decirte Papá&quot;, &quot;Y la fiesta comenzó&quot; and &quot;Somos amigos&quot;.

Due to the success obtained, and in order to have a wider repertoire in their presentations, the group recorded a second album titled &quot;La Banda Timbiriche&quot;, which included the hit singles &quot;La Banda Timbiriche&quot;, &quot;La vida es mejor cantando&quot;, &quot;México&quot; and &quot;Mamá&quot; . The group is also chosen to interpret the musical theme of the children&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Chispita&quot;. In that same year, the group participates in a special of television where it shares scene with the group Parchís.

In 1983, the group released the album &quot;La Banda Timbiriche: En Concierto&quot; an album that was released under the concept of being a live album, although in fact the sound effects of the public were added in the recording studio. The album includes covers of songs in English and of musicals famous at that time like &quot;Time Warp&quot; of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, &quot;One Step&quot; (cover of Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn&#x27; song), &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (from the musical &quot;Grease&quot;) and &quot;Mickey&quot; (cover by Toni Basil). In this third album, the group already enjoyed a great acceptance in Mexico, receiving several disks of gold by the high sales of its albums.

At that moment of the group, the voices of the only two male members of the group were confused with those of the female members due to their young age. Because of this, the producers considered the idea of integrating a third male member into the group. The chosen one was Erik Rubín, who joins the band in December 1983. The band launches its fourth disc, titled &quot;Timbiriche Disco Ruido&quot;. The album was the first big challenge of the band, because it was not known what the public reaction would be to the new member, who had to go through many conflicts to adapt with his peers. However, the album had a good reception and contained hits such as &quot;Disco ruido&quot; and &quot;Adiós a la escuela&quot;.

===Teen Band (1985-1987)===
In 1984, Timbiriche, along with several other children actors and singers, starred in a version of the play &quot;Grease&quot; (called &quot;Vaselina&quot; in Mexico). The play was produced by the actress and producer Julissa. From this staging comes the album &quot;Timbiriche Vaselina&quot;, which was another success of the grouping. The album released the hit singles &quot;Amor primero (Those Magic Changes)&quot;, &quot;Rayo Rebelde (Grease Lightnin&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;Freddy mi amor (Freddy My love)&quot; and &quot;Iremos juntos (We Go Together)&quot;.

For 1985, the group begins an evolution. They were no longer a children&#x27;s group, and this situation leads to a new, fresher sound aimed at teenagers. This change is evident in the record &quot;Timbiriche Rock Show&quot;, released in 1985.

But in the middle of the success, Benny decides to leave the group in September of that same year, after the recording of the album and after to have participated only in the promotion of the first two singles. His reason was that he wanted to prepare in music by enrolling in a school in the United States. The singer chosen to replace him was Eduardo Capetillo, who already had become known for his stellar participation in the play &quot;Grease&quot;. Eduardo was the one who performed the rest of the album&#x27;s promotion. From this production stand out songs like &quot;Teléfono&quot; (cover of Sheena Easton&#x27;s song &quot;Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair)&quot;), &quot;Juntos&quot;, &quot;Soy un desastre&quot;, &quot;Corro, vuelo, me acelero&quot;, &quot;Me planto&quot; y &quot;Mi globo azul&quot; (cover of Nena&#x27; s song &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;).

In August 1986 Sasha, another founding member, announced her departure from the group in order to become independent and launch herself as a solo singer. A month later, her place is occupied by Thalía, who had been announced a few years ago in a children&#x27;s musical group called &quot;Din-Din&quot;, and also served as a substitute for Sasha in the &quot;Grease&quot; play.

In 1987, Timbiriche released the album &quot;Timbiriche VII&quot;. With this album, the group obtains a success superior to the one of the previous disc, consolidating like one of the youthful groups leaders of Latin America and Spain. The album included hits like &quot;No seas tan cruel&quot;, &quot;Besos de ceniza&quot;, &quot;Mírame (Cuestión de tiempo)&quot;, &quot;Si no es ahora&quot;, &quot;Con todos menos conmigo&quot;, &quot;Rompecabezas&quot;, &quot;Mágico amor&quot; and &quot;Ya estaba escrito&quot;.

In that same year, Timbiriche interprets the main theme of the telenovela &quot;Quinceañera&quot;, that was carried out by Thalía and the actress Adela Noriega.

In December of that same year, the group is invited to participate in the Christmas album &quot;Esta navidad&quot;, next to another artists. Timbiriche interprets the song &quot;¡Ay del Chiquirritín!&quot;. In that same month, Mariana Garza, another of the founding members of the group, announces her departure from the group to enter as a television actress. It is Mariana herself who chooses for her replacement Edith Márquez, another young girl who was also part of &quot;Grease&quot;s cast. In addition, Edith already was well-known for her participation in the TV sitcom &quot;Papá soltero&quot;. Edith lived a difficult process of adaptation when arriving at the group.

===Adult Band (1988-1991)===
The double album &quot;Timbiriche VIII &amp; IX&quot; was released on 7 May 1988. The record was produced as a double album, as producers did not decide to choose the repertoire of songs that would include in the new album. At the time, the double discs were a novelty in Latin America and few artists were encouraged to produce them. The album (which was also released for sale separately) included the hit singles &quot;Tú y yo somos uno mismo&quot;, &quot;Ámame hasta con los dientes&quot;, &quot;Acelerar&quot;, &quot;Yo no se si es amor&quot;, &quot;Me estoy volviendo loca&quot;, &quot;Junto a tí&quot;, &quot;Máscaras&quot;, &quot;Pasos&quot; and &quot;Tú me vuelves loco&quot;. This period is considered as the zenith in the trajectory of the group and gives another step in its evolution, positioning itself as a young adult band.

In November 1988, Alix, another of the founders, decides to leave the group to prepare her solo career. After a series of auditions, in February 1989 her place is occupied by Bibi Gaytán, who ends next to the rest of the members the tour corresponding to the double album.

In February 1989 goes out for sale the first compilation album of the group titled &quot;Los Clásicos de Timbiriche&quot;. The album contains a compilation of the group&#x27;s greatest hits, accompanied by the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico City, and was recorded in the Sala Netzahualcoyotl of Mexico City. The disc included an unpublished song, titled &quot;Por tí&quot;, and counted with the participation of Benny, Sasha and Mariana, the former members of the group. The production was recorded at the end of 1988, when Alix was still part of the group, but was released on sale until February 1989. That&#x27;s why Bibi was not included in the album.

In July 1989, Eduardo Capetillo and Thalía also opt to leave the group to prepare their solo careers. After new auditions, their places are occupied by Claudio Bermúdez and Patty Tanús respectively.

The album &quot;Timbiriche X&quot; is considered by many as the last album that retains the original style of the band that, at the moment, already had only three of the original members: Paulina, Diego and Erik, besides Edith and Bibi, who were joined by Claudio and Patty. However, after only a few months, Patty is expelled from the group for having lied to producers regarding her age and marital status, being replaced by Silvia Campos, who although she did not record the album, if she toured and promoted it . The disc contained a strong influence of the dance music, that at that moment enjoyed enormous popularity in the dance floors of the world. The album included the successful singles &quot;Princesa Tibetana&quot;, &quot;Me pongo mal&quot;, &quot;Historia de amor&quot;, &quot;Yo no soy una más&quot;, &quot;Sacudete&quot; and &quot;Como te diré&quot;. With this record, Timbiriche receives his first &quot;Eres&quot; Award as Best Pop Group. In 1991, the group celebrates its 10th anniversary.

But at the end of the tour, Paulina, another of the founding members, leaves the group to open a career as a soloist. Just two weeks later, Erik, Edith and Bibi also announce their departure from the group to pursue a career as soloists. This situation leaves Diego as the only original member of the band, in addition to Claudio and Silvia.

===The Second Generation (1991-1994)===

Without the majority of its original members, the group was in decline, but the producers decided to continue with the concept and bet on launching a new generation. Surprisingly, in the midst of production, Claudio is fired from the group.

By the end of 1991, the band returns with five new members: Lorena Shelley, Daniel Gaytan, Tannya Velasco, Kenya Hijuelos and Alexa Lozano. Together with Diego and Silvia they record the album &quot;Timbiriche XI&quot;. In 1992, Kenya leaves the group before the official presentation of the disc by decision of the creators of the group by conflicts between the new members, being replaced by Jean Duverger. This second generation is officially presented during a broadcast of &quot;Siempre en domingo&quot;, in which all former members were invited to introduce the new members. This meeting was unique, since it had almost all the members of the group, being the only ones missing Diego, due to health problems and Thalía, who was working in Spain.

Despite retaining the name and concept in general, there was a new musical style that mixed dance and tropical rhythms. Although the album was not so popular with fans of the first generation, it began to appeal to younger generations, thanks to hits like &quot;Vanidosa&quot;, &quot;Sólo te quiero a tí&quot;, &quot;Tierra dorada&quot;, and &quot;Piel a piel&quot;, receiving disc of Gold and platinum by high sales. Thanks to this the group could survive another year.

For 1993 they record &quot;Timbiriche XII&quot;, disc of which it was detached like the last success of the group: &quot;Muriendo Lento&quot; (cover of &quot;Slowly&quot; original song of the ex- singer of the Swedish group ABBA, Anni-Frid Lyngstad). But at the beginning of 1994 Alexa decided to leave the group, announcing it in a concert in Monterrey to the fans without having said before to the managers and companions. This was one of the reasons that led to the final disintegration.

===First Reunion (1998-1999)===
In 1998, in the frame of the &quot;Festival Acapulco &#x27;98&quot;, the original six members reunited in the scene in a historical night that broke record of hearing. After the success obtained, it reissues the disc &quot;Los Clásicos de Timbiriche&quot;, now with the name of &quot;Timbiriche Symphonic&quot; that generated great stir among the followers.

Plans for a formal reunion crystallized in late November 1998, when the group performed a concert at the Auditorio Nacional of Mexico City. This concert also included Erik Rubín. For 1999, the group initiated a tour that was developed by all Mexico and part of Latin America. The reunion established in the Auditorio Nacional a record of hearing with more than 20 consecutive concerts. The tour would conclude with a massive concert at Foro Sol, also in Mexico City.

From that tour a double album titled &quot;Timbiriche, El concierto&quot;, was recorded that was recorded live in the Auditorio Nacional on 20 December 1998. This album also included three new songs: &quot;Esta Despierto&quot;, &quot;Suma Cósmica&quot; and &quot;La Fuerza del Amor&quot;.

===25th Anniversary Reunion (2007-2008)===
The original members of the group (including Erik, and with the exception of Paulina Rubio, who can not participate for personal commitments), reunited in 2007 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band (30 April 2007). The celebration took place through a tour of concerts and three albums: one before the concerts, titled &quot;Timbiriche 25&quot;, with new versions of 12 classic songs of the group, a live album with some songs of the concert titled &quot;Somos Timbiriche 25&quot; and finally the live album &quot;Timbiriche Vivo en Vivo&quot; (cd double + DVD) with the full version of the concert. The album also includes three unpublished songs: &quot;Vuelvo a Comenzar&quot;, &quot;Atado a tí&quot; and &quot;Domar el Aire&quot;. These themes are a gift and thanks to the fans who helped make Timbiriche&#x27;s 25th anniversary a great success.

Timbiriche broke its record in the Auditorio Nacional with more than 20 consecutive performances with full masses and more than 30 concerts throughout Mexico. On Monday, 5 May 2008 Timbiriche closed the celebration of its 25 years at Foro Sol.

On 17 May 2008, the group participated at the Mexico City ALAS concert, benefitting poor children in Latin America. The group performed alongside singers like Miguel Bosé, Ricky Martin, Maná, and Chayanne, among others.

In addition, film director Carlos Marcovich who accompanied the group for much of the tour, announced the production of a documentary feature on Timbiriche, which was called &quot;La misma Piedra&quot; and premiered on Friday, 21 November 2008 in all Mexico cinemas.

===The Reality Show===
To celebrate the group&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Televisa launched a great call for the formation of a new Band Timbiriche, this time formed by seven young people between 15-22 years old. The process was carried out through a reality show called &quot;Buscando a Timbiriche, La Nueva Banda&quot;. It was attended by 30 young people, and was endorsed by some of the original creators of the concept and other personalities of the show (Luis de Llano, Memo Méndez Guiú, Marco Flavio Cruz, Marta Zavaleta, Amparo Rubin and Kiko Campos). The six members of the project Timbiriche 25 (Diego, Erick, Sasha, Alix, Mariana and Benny) who participated as a jury evaluating the performance of the candidates. The band would be called The New Timbiriche Band.

Brissia, Fernanda, Gabriela, Taide, Alberto, Eduardo and Yurem, were chosen to form this new group. But the concept did not have the expected success. Only the single &quot;Tú, tú, tú&quot; achieve some acceptance of the public. The group disbanded in April 2009.

===The Musical===
In October 2007, producer Pedro Damián announced that he was planning to make a feature film based on Timbiriche&#x27;s songs.

The script was written by Martha Carrillo and Cristina García (who wrote the script for the telenovela &quot;Tres Mujeres&quot;) which tells the story of adolescent love through the music of Sasha, Benny, Diego, Mariana, Álix, Érick, and Paulina.

About the project, Damián said, &quot;It&#x27;s like the play &quot;Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar&quot; (with music from Mecano) or like the Abba play &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; — plays that used the music from the groups with different stories.&quot;

Carrillo told a Mexican newspaper that the plot deals with &quot;the life of some kids who are trying to move forward with music, but not as a band; the main character is a composer, but she&#x27;s not the one who sings.&quot;

The idea for a movie has been put on hiatus and the project has been initiated as a theatrical touring musical. The musical began auditions in January 2010 and is called Timbiriche: El Musical (Timbiriche: The Musical). The musical play is a love story that uses Timbiriche&#x27;s songs as expressions but does not tell the story of the Timbiriche band.

===35th Anniversary Reunion (2017)===
On 30 April 2017, Timbiriche celebrated its 35th anniversary. After several rumors and requests from fans through social networks, on 29 May 2017, Erik Rubin held a press conference where he announced the group&#x27;s third reunion to commemorate its anniversary. As revealed by Rubin, this reunion started in September 2017 with an initial tour of 30 shows. The reunion tour featured the six original members of the band: Benny Ibarra, Sasha Sokol, Erik Rubin, Alix Bauer, Mariana Garza and Diego Schoening.

<doc id="1161712" wikidata="Q534855" url="?curid=1161712" title="Asterix at the Olympic Games">
<text>Asterix at the Olympic Games is the 12th comic book album in the Asterix series. Serialized in Pilote issues 434–455 in 1968 (to coincide with the Mexico City Olympics), it was translated into English in 1972 (to coincide with the Munich Olympics). The story satirizes performance-enhancing drug usage in sports.

==Plot==
At the Roman camp of Aquarium near the Gauls&#x27; village, Gluteus Maximus, an athletic Roman legionary, is chosen as one of Rome&#x27;s representatives for the upcoming Olympic Games in Greece. Gaius Veriambitius, his centurion, hopes to share in the glory of Olympic victory. While training in the forest, Gluteus Maximus encounters Asterix and Obelix, who unintentionally outdo him at running, then javelin and boxing, thanks to the power of the magic potion. Demoralised, he consigns himself to sweeping the Roman camp instead of training. When Veriambitius asks Vitalstatistix that Gluteus Maximus be left alone, Vitalstatistix decides the Gauls should enter the Olympic Games as well. Veriambitius argues they cannot, as Romans are the only non-Greeks allowed, but Asterix rationalizes that as Gaul is part of the Roman Empire, they are technically Romans (despite their resistance to Roman rule), making them a Gallo-Roman team, demoralising the centurion and his legionary further. The Gauls hold trials that prove inconclusive as everyone is dosed with the magic potion and thus do everything at the same top speed and strength. Eventually, they decide to register only Asterix and Obelix as competitors.

The entire (male) population of the village travels to Olympia in Greece (aboard a galley where they have to do the rowing), where Asterix and Obelix register as athletes (with Getafix as their coach) and the others all enjoy a holiday. When Gluteus Maximus and Veriambitius discover that the Gauls have come to compete, they are left in despair (Vitalstatistix telling them &quot;We&#x27;re not stopping you entering, it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re going to win&quot;), and this despair spreads among all the Roman athletes. They give up training and spend all their time having elaborate parties, washing their uniforms and sweeping the whole area. The scent from their feasts eventually causes the Greek competitors to complain about their own healthy food. Alarmed, the Greeks send a judge to warn the Romans that even if they think drinking will somehow make them better athletes, it will be held against them as all artificial stimulants are forbidden, prompting Veriambitius to tell him about the Gauls&#x27; magic potion. The Gauls are dejected by the news that victory is not as certain as they had expected, but Asterix decides to compete anyway. Obelix, being permanently affected by the potion, now cannot compete and anyway doesn&#x27;t quite understand what&#x27;s going on – he thinks he&#x27;s been dismissed just because he fell into a cauldron and wonders if telling the officials he fell into a regular pot or amphora will change anything.

At the games, Asterix and the Roman athletes are beaten at every turn by the Greeks, causing a dilemma to the Olympic officials. Although their victories prove what they&#x27;ve believed all along (that Romans are decadent barbarians and the Greeks are perfect beings), too much success will reflect badly on the country&#x27;s reputation, so they announce a special race for just Romans. After the announcement, Asterix and Getafix start talking, very loudly, about a cauldron of magic potion left in an unguarded shed. Eager to win, the other Roman athletes steal the potion that night.

The race begins, and the Roman athletes easily beat Asterix - they all overtake him and cross the finish line simultaneously. After the race, Getafix accuses them of having used magic potion and, when the Romans deny the accusation, Asterix sticks his tongue out at them. When the Romans return the gesture, it is revealed that Getafix had added an extra ingredient to this particular batch of potion and the Romans now have blue tongues from drinking it. They are disqualified, and Asterix is declared the winner.

The Gauls return home for their traditional banquet. Getafix notices Asterix hasn&#x27;t brought his Palm of Victory home. Asterix explains he gave it to someone who needed it more: Gluteus Maximus. Gluteus&#x27; apparent victory is shown to have greatly pleased Julius Caesar, who promotes Maximus to centurion and Veriambitius to tribune.

==Notes==
*Geriatrix debuts in this volume.
*The cart bringing the male Gauls to their inn after arriving in Greece plays the role of a coach.

== Film adaptation ==

A live action movie of this book was released in France in January 2008 to coincide with the Beijing Olympics. Even though it is similar to the original story, there are some differences. The main one being instead of the whole village taking part in the games, only Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Dogmatix, and a new character named Lovesix take part in the games in order for Lovesix to win the heart of, and show his worthiness for, princess Irina. There is also another subplot about Julius Caesar&#x27;s son Brutus, who also wants to marry the princess, overthrow his father and take over the Roman empire.

==Goscinny and Uderzo cameo==
Authors Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo appear on page 25 in a carved bas-relief at the front of the Olympic Village. Goscinny is calling Uderzo a &#x27;despot&#x27; and Uderzo replies with &#x27;tyrant&#x27;. The two are pacifying a bull, implying that creating an Asterix story is a Herculean task.

<text>The 1917 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 26, 1917, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

After replacing Walter Scott as leader of the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan and premier of the province, William M. Martin led the party to its fourth consecutive victory, winning all but 8 of the 59 seats in the legislature.

The Conservative Party of Wellington Willoughby continued to lose popular support.

This was the first Saskatchewan election in which women were allowed to vote and run for office. However, none were declared elected in this vote; the first Saskatchewan woman elected an MLA was after a 1918 by-election.

The Non-Partisan League, forerunner of the Progressive Party of Saskatchewan, nominated candidates for the first time, although none were successful. Labour candidates also appeared for the first time.

David John Sykes became the first Independent to sit in the Saskatchewan legislature. He was nominated by the Liberal, Conservative and Non-Partisan League organizations, and thus was acclaimed this election.

An at-large service vote was held to elect three soldiers from October 3 to October 13, 1917. All service members were not affiliated, and were elected to represent Saskatchewan residents stationed in France, Belgium and Great Britain.

==Results==

Note:* Party did not nominate candidates in previous election.

===Notes===
1 Magnus Ramsland died in 1918. In the resulting by-election, he was succeeded by his widow Sarah Ramsland, the first woman ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

==October 13, 1917 service vote results==
Like other provinces Saskatchewan held a service vote – actually two separate votes – for Saskatchewan residents in the Canadian armed services fighting during World War I. The first vote was for France and Belgium – two members were elected in a block vote; the top member represented France and the second member elected represented Belgium. Another member was also elected to represent troops in Great Britain. Three seats in the Legislature were set aside for these soldier-MLAs.

<doc id="1161718" wikidata="Q11036624" url="?curid=1161718" title="A Dog of Flanders">
<text>A Dog of Flanders is an 1872 novel by English author Marie Louise de la Ramée published under her pseudonym &quot;Ouida&quot;. It is about a Flemish boy named Nello and his dog, Patrasche, and is set in Antwerp.

In Japan, Korea, Russia, Ukraine and the Philippines, the novel has been a popular children&#x27;s classic for decades and has been adapted into several Japanese films and anime. Since the 1980s, the Belgian board of tourism noticed the phenomenon and built two monuments honoring the story to attract East-Asian tourists. There is a small statue of Nello and Patrasche at the Kapelstraat in the Antwerp suburb of Hoboken, and a commemorative plaque in front of the Antwerp Cathedral donated by Toyota, that was later replaced by a marble statue of the two characters covered by a cobblestone blanket, created by the artist Batist Vermeulen.

== Summary ==
In 19th-century Belgium, a boy named Nello becomes an orphan at the age of two when his mother dies in the Ardennes. His impoverished grandfather, Jehan Daas, who lives in a small village near the city of Antwerp, takes him in.

One day, Nello and Jehan find a dog that was almost beaten to death, and name him &quot;Patrasche&quot;. Due to the good care and kindness shown to him by Jehan, the dog recovers its health, and from then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Nello is forced to work as a milk seller, because Jehan&#x27;s unnamed, crooked landlord demands that he pay more rent money or face eviction. Patrasche helps Nello pull his small milk cart into town each morning.

Nello falls in love with Aloise, the daughter of Baas Cogez, a well-off man in the village, but Baas objects, as he doesn&#x27;t want his daughter to have a poor sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win the first prize of 200 francs per year; however, the jury selects a different winner.

Sometime later, a fire breaks out on Baas&#x27;s property. To escape responsibility for neglecting the property, the landlord lies and suggests that Nello was responsible for the fire; Baas then tells Nello that he is never to see Aloise again. Later, Jehan dies, and the landlord promptly evicts Nello and Patrasche. With no home, they are forced to wander the streets.

Distraught and miserable, Nello decides that he wants to go to the cathedral of Antwerp, to see Rubens&#x27; &quot;The Elevation of the Cross&quot; and &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot;—but the exhibition in the cathedral is only for paying customers, and he has no money left. On the night of Christmas Eve, Nello and Patrasche find that the door to the church has been left unlocked. They go inside, and the next morning are found dead of hypothermia in front of the triptych.

==Popularity==
The novel shares a reasonable notability in both the United Kingdom and the United States and is extremely popular in Ukraine, Russia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines to the point where it is seen as a children&#x27;s classic. It inspired film and anime adaptations, including the 1975 animated TV series &quot;Dog of Flanders&quot; which reached an audience of 30 million viewers on its first broadcast.

In Belgium, the story is more obscure. Only in 1987 did it receive a Dutch translation; this happened after the tale was adapted into a story of the popular comic book series &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;. Since then, monuments were raised to commemorate Nello and Patrasche to please tourists. In 2007, Didier Volckaert and An van Dienderen directed a documentary about the international popularity of the story: &quot;Patrasche, A Dog of Flanders – Made in Japan&quot;. It researches all available film adaptations of the story and interviews several British, American and Japanese people about what attracts them to this novel.

===Film, TV and theatrical adaptations===

The novel has been adapted for cinema and television in live-action and animation. Many of the film versions, excluding the 1997 Japanese movie and &quot;Snow Prince&quot; (2009), replace the original ending with a more optimistic one.

In one of the film versions (1959), Nello and his dog go to the village church, where the pastor covers them with a woolen blanket, thus saving their lives. Two days later, one of the judges comes. Because he thought Nello was the true winner, he asks him to stay with him. As years pass, Patrasche dies and Nello becomes a famous artist.

===Documentary film===
* &quot;Patrasche, a Dog of Flanders – Made in Japan&quot; (2007), a documentary film directed by Didier Volckaert and An van Dienderen.

===Comic book version===
The story was used as a plot device in the &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; comic book series, namely the album &quot;Het Dreigende Dinges&quot; (&quot;The Threatening Thing&quot;) (1985). The album was translated into Japanese.

===Location and monuments===
In 1985 an employee of Antwerp tourism, Jan Corteel, learned of the popularity of &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot; in East Asia and attempted to develop a tourist itinerary for it. He presumed the village in which the majority of the story takes place to be Hoboken, even though this is never mentioned in the story itself. Ouida is believed to have visited Antwerp for four hours, and spoke of having seen a village near a canal, not far from a windmill. This vague explanation was used to claim the story took place in Hoboken, but other people contest this. Corteel attracted funds for a monument, which was built in 1985 in the Kapelstraat in Hoboken.

A second monument, now removed, was donated by Toyota in 2003 in front of Antwerp Cathedral. A mock gravestone, it had text in English and Japanese that read: &quot;Nello, and his dog Patrasche, main characters from the story &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot;, symbols of true and sternful friendship, loyalty and devotion.&quot;

On 10 December 2016, the gravestone was replaced by a new monument. A sculpture in white marble represents Nello and Patrasche sleeping, covered by a blanket of cobble stones. The sculpture is made by Belgian artist Batist &quot;Tist&quot; Vermeulen. The removal of the gravestone was accompanied by a noticeable decline in the number of Japanese tourists, the reason for which is unclear.

<doc id="1161724" wikidata="Q7617919" url="?curid=1161724" title="Stock sound effect">
<text>A stock sound effect is a prerecorded sound effect intended to be reused with an entertainment product, as opposed to creating a new and unique sound effect. It is intended to work within a sound effect library.

==History==
As far back as Ancient Greece, sound effects have been used in entertainment productions. Sound effects (also known as &quot;sound FX&quot;, &quot;SFX&quot;, or simply &quot;FX&quot;) are used to enhance theatre, radio, film, television, video games, and online media.

Sound effects were originally added to productions by creating the sounds needed in real-time. Various devices and props were utilized to approximate the actual sounds, including coconut shells for horse hooves, and a sheet of metal for thunder. With the advent of radio and specifically radio dramas, the role of sound effects became more important. When cinema went from silent to &quot;talkies&quot;, sound effects became a large part of this new medium, too.

Audio recording technology continued to evolve, making it easier to record and replay sound. As this happened, the more commonly used and harder-to-replicate sound effects were pre-recorded to make them more accessible. Prerecording also allowed the same sound effect to be used many times.

Both producers&#x27; and listeners&#x27; sensibilities began evolving with the technology, and the need for more realistic sound effects or for using the &quot;real&quot; sound increased. Therefore, a more urgent need developed for prerecorded sound effects.

Over time, the quality of audio recording and playback increased, as did the demand for a wider variety of highly specific sounds. For example, rather than use a generic gunshot, a producer might request a gunshot from a specific type of gun, shot under precise conditions. Access to &quot;real&quot; sound effects became increasingly important to producers.

These collections of prerecorded sound effects, both real and artificial, began to be referred to as stock sound effects and were organized into libraries. As their usage increased, stock sound effects libraries became the valuable assets of sound design artists and production companies. Some stock sound effects have been reused so many times that they have become easily recognizable and even cliché. Examples of these include the scream of a red-tailed hawk, castle thunder, or the Wilhelm and Howie screams.

Many of the original sound effects libraries originated in the mid to late 1950s from film and television studios that employed the artists who created them, such as Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera. Audio Fidelity Records was one of the first record labels to join in releasing compilations from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, notably Elektra alongside Jac Holzman&#x27;s released &quot;Authentic Sound Effects&quot; in 1964 as a 13 volume series. Over time, independent companies such as &quot;Sound Ideas&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Edge&quot; became involved, both distributing the major studios&#x27; libraries as well as making their own available to the public.

The internet ushered in a new generation of technology, entertainment media, and sound effects libraries. Sounddogs became the first to distribute sound effects libraries over the internet and Soundrangers became the first to create an all-new sound effects library for internet-based entertainment. Dozens of other websites now provide stock sounds for movies, video games, and software. Others such as Freesound aim to provide free sound effects under the public domain.

Over the years, with the evolution of sound recording technology and new formats, the format used for sound effects libraries also evolved. Sound libraries are now available on many types of media, including vinyl records, reel-to-reel tape, cassette tapes, compact discs, hard drives, and via the internet. Sound effects libraries now include more complex, layered, and mixed sounds along with a wider variety of incidental real-world sounds.

==Often-used examples==

*Wilhelm scream — a man screaming, first used in a 1951 Western and used as a running joke by sound designers in many films and television shows

*Universal stock roar — the second-largest stock sound in &quot;The Land Unknown&quot;; louder than the Tarzan yell

*Sharptooth roar — a stock roar in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;

*Spider Mastermind alert sound — (titled DSSPISIT within Doom&#x27;s WAD files, also known as Animal, Creature - Large Animal Death Scream) — stock sound effect of an ear-piercing screeching roar, transcribed as &quot;Woo-roooo!&quot;, frequently used in television and video games. Belonging in the same Sound Ideas library as the Sharptooth roar, this sound effect was compiled for Doom by music composer Bobby Prince, which would become the alert sound for the game&#x27;s final boss the Spider Mastermind whenever Doomguy enters its line of sight or engages in combat.
*Howie scream — (also known as the Howie Long scream or Screams 3; Man, Gut-Wrenching Scream and Fall into Distance) is a frequently used film, television, and video game stock sound effect for a scream. Often compared to the Wilhelm scream, its prominence in a number of movies has launched a few nicknames such as Howie Long Scream, in reference to Howie Long&#x27;s character&#x27;s death scene in the 1996 film &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. It appears to have originated from a fight scene in the 1980 film &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;.

*Click Plink — (also known as the Clicker Plinker or Plink, Cartoon - Sour Plink) a common Hanna-Barbera poking or plucking sound in cartoons
*WB&#x27;s Slide string — a slide string 1/7 short / long / shuttered
*Tarzan yell — distinctive, ululating yell of the character Tarzan as portrayed by actor Johnny Weissmuller in the films based on the character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs starting with &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932)

*Goofy holler — the cry that the Disney character Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as &quot;Yaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!&quot;

*Universal telephone ring — a ringing telephone, used in the opening credits of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; designed by Ben Burtt
*Red-tailed hawk calls — the piercing scream of the red-tailed hawk is widely used for birds of prey, especially bald eagles, as well as shots of nature, including deserts and mountains

*The Dolphin Chirp Stock Sound Effect — debuted in the 1960s film &quot;Flipper&quot; and is ubiquitous, now being heard in hundreds of media. It is also used as a reference to the SpongeBob SquarePants episode &quot;Sailor Mouth&quot; due to SpongeBob using it out of context.
*Common loon calls — the wailing call of the loon is widely used in film and television to evoke wilderness and suspense

*Castle thunder — a loud thunderclap during a rainstorm, originally recorded for the 1931 Universal Pictures film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;

*Diddy laugh — (also known as Two Children Giggling or Two Young Kids Giggle) a sound of two children giggling acquired by The Hollywood Edge on August 13, 1990, originally recorded in 1978 for the 1990 TriStar Pictures film &quot;Air America&quot; and colloquially named for its use in the 1997 video game &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;.

<doc id="1161737" wikidata="Q3508217" url="?curid=1161737" title="Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje">
<text>The Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje was an armoured regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army, named after Prince Willem, Prince of Orange, eldest son of King Willem II. The regiment served as part of 43 Gemechaniseerde (Mechanized) Brigade operating the Leopard 2 main battle tank.

The Regiment Huzaren Prinses Catharina-Amalia, which is a company in the 414th Panzer Battalion, is a cavalry regiment formed in late 2020 through the amalgamation of three other Dutch cavalry regiments that, at the time, existed in suspension - the Regiment Huzaren Prins Alexander, Regiment Huzaren Van Sytzama and Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje. 

== History ==
Shortly before the Battle of Waterloo, Major Count du Chastel de la Hovarderie was ordered by the King to form a Regiment of Carabiniers Land militia. When the Battle of Waterloo took place, the unit was not yet sufficiently trained so was in the &#x27;Reserve Armee&#x27;. 

From 1816-67 the regiments designation successively changed. In 1841, it was transformed into a Dragoon regiment (2nd Dragoon Regiment), followed by another transformation in 1867, when it became the 2nd Hussar Regiment. 

The regiment fought with distinction against the Belgians during the Ten Day Campaign (Tiendaagse Veldtocht) in August 1831. From 1922 to 1939 the Dutch army went through severe cutbacks, and the 4 hussar regiments were halved. 

In the mobilisation after 1939, the Dutch army wanted to improve its organisation, and a large move took place on May 1, 1941. This moved units around, meaning that the defenders advantage of knowing the terrain was often lost. There were only 2 squadrons of armoured cars in the regiment. Until May 1940 the cavalry was still partly on horseback. The unit fought through the whole time the Netherlands was in the war. The regiment had several clashes with Germans, and was often bombed by German planes. Their main action was defending the bridges at Geertruidenberg and Keizersveer, preventing an SS-Brigade from crossing the bridges despite heavy fighting. The regiment was disbanded after the armistice in 1940, but was raised again in 1978, as the Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje.

<text>The word hobbit was used by J. R. R. Tolkien as the name of a race of small humanoids in his fantasy fiction, the first published being &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1937. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, which added an entry for the word in the 1970s, credits Tolkien with coining it. Since then, however, it has been noted that there is prior evidence of the word, in a 19th-century list of legendary creatures. In 1971, Tolkien stated that he remembered making up the word himself, admitting that there was nothing but his &quot;nude parole&quot; to support the claim that he was uninfluenced by such similar words as &quot;hobgoblin&quot;. His choice may have been affected on his own admission by the title of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey has pointed out several parallels, including comparisons in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, with the word &quot;rabbit&quot;.

== Use by Tolkien ==

=== Proposed etymology ===

By Tolkien&#x27;s own account, the coining of the name &quot;hobbit&quot; was a spontaneous flash of intuition. When he was busy grading examination papers, the word popped into his mind, not in isolation but as part of an entire sentence, which was to become the of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot;

Tolkien etymologized the name &quot;hobbit&quot; as the regular Modern English outcome of a hypothetical Old English &quot;*hol-bytla&quot; &quot;hole builder&quot;. Within the linguistic fiction of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the English etymology of Old English &quot;hol-bytlan&quot; → Modern English &quot;hobbit&quot; is the supposed translation of an &quot;original&quot; etymology of Rohirric &quot;kud-dukan&quot; → Westron &quot;kuduk&quot;.

=== Tolkien&#x27;s statements ===

On 16 January 1938, shortly after the original release of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; a letter by a &quot;Habit&quot; in the English paper &quot;The Observer&quot; asked if Tolkien&#x27;s Hobbits were modelled after &quot;&#x27;little furry men&#x27; seen in Africa by natives and … at least one scientist&quot;, and also referenced an old fairy tale called &quot;The Hobbit&quot; from 1904, but Tolkien denied using these sources as inspiration, and no trace of the African Hobbits or the fairy tale collection was ever found. Tolkien replied to this letter with:
:&quot;I do not remember anything about the name and inception of the hero… I have no waking recollection of furry pigmies (in book or moonlight); nor of any Hobbit bogey in print by 1904. I suspect that the two hobbits are accidental homophones, and am content that they are not synonymous. And I protest that my hobbit did not live in Africa, and was not furry, except about the feet. Nor indeed was he a rabbit….&quot;

Tolkien also acknowledged the possible unconscious connection to others&#x27; writings, particularly those of Sinclair Lewis, who wrote the novel &quot;Babbitt&quot; in 1922. In a 1966 correspondence with Professor Harry Bauer of the University of Washington, Tolkien wrote, &quot;...I now wonder whether Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s Babbitt had not some part in the invention of this name: &quot;hobbit&quot;. I read all of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s works.&quot;

In 1970 the Oxford Dictionary wrote to Professor Tolkien asking for the origins of the word, as they wished to include &#x27;Hobbit&#x27; in the dictionary. Tolkien replied:

: &quot;For the moment this is held up, because I am having the matter of the etymology: &#x27;Invented by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;: investigated by experts. I knew that the claim was not clear, but I had not troubled to look into it, until faced by the inclusion of hobbit in the Supplement.&quot;

In the event Hobbit was fully ascribed to Tolkien, as no earlier source was found.
In 1971 Tolkien once again referred to his &quot;invention&quot;:
:&quot;The Ox. E. D. has in preparation of its Second Supplement got to Hobbit, which it proposes to include together with its progeny: hobbitry, -ish, etc. I have had, therefore, to justify my claim to have invented the word. My claim rests really on my &#x27;nude parole&#x27; or unsupported assertion that I remember the occasion of its invention (by me); and that I had not then any knowledge of Hobberdy, Hobbaty, Hobberdy Dick etc. (for &#x27;house-sprites&#x27;)†; and that my &#x27;hobbits&#x27; were in any case of wholly dissimilar sort, a diminutive branch of the human race.

:&quot;† I have now! Probably more than most other folk; and find myself in a v. tangled wood—the clue to which is, however, the belief in incubi and &#x27;changelings&#x27;. Alas! one conclusion is that the statement that hobgoblins were &#x27;a larger kind&#x27; is the reverse of the original truth. (The statement occurs in the preliminary note on Runes devised for the paperback edition, but now included by A &amp; U in all edns.)&quot;

== Possible inspirations ==

=== Hob-beings ===

The name &quot;hobbit&quot; for a diminutive legendary creature fits into a category of English words in &quot;hob-&quot; for such beings, based on the Middle English &quot;hobbe&quot;. These include hob, hobby, hobgoblin, Hobberdy Dick, Hobberdy, Hobbaty, hobbidy, Hobley, , hobble, hobi, hobyn (small horse), hobby horse (perhaps from Hobin), Hobby (nickname for Robert), hobyah, Hob Lantern. This theory was reinforced when in 1977 the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; announced that it had found the source that it supposed Tolkien to have used: J. Hardy&#x27;s 1895 &quot;The Denham Tracts, Volume 2&quot;, which stated that &quot;The whole earth was overrun with ghosts, boggles ... hobbits, hobgoblins.&quot; The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the list was, however, of ghostly creatures without bodies, nothing like Tolkien&#x27;s solid flesh-and-blood hobbits.

=== Rabbit ===

Shippey notes a different connection, with rabbit, something that Tolkien &quot;emphatically rejected&quot;, although the word appears in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in other characters&#x27; opinions of Bilbo in several places. Bilbo compares himself to a rabbit when he is with the eagle that carries him; the eagle, too, tells Bilbo not to be &quot;frightened like a rabbit&quot;. The giant bear-man Beorn teases Bilbo and jokes that &quot;little bunny is getting nice and fat again&quot;, while the dwarf Thorin shakes Bilbo &quot;like a rabbit&quot;.

Shippey writes that rabbit is not a native English species, but was deliberately introduced in the 13th century, and has become accepted as a local wild animal. Shippey compares this &quot;situation of anachronism-cum-familiarity&quot; with the lifestyle of the hobbit, giving the example of smoking &quot;pipeweed&quot;. He argues that Tolkien did not want to write &quot;tobacco&quot;, as it did not arrive until the 16th century, so Tolkien invented a calque made of English words. Donald O&#x27;Brien notes, too, that Aragorn&#x27;s description of Frodo&#x27;s priceless &quot;mithril&quot; mail-shirt, &quot;here&#x27;s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in&quot;, is a &quot;curious echo&quot; of the English nursery rhyme &quot;To find a pretty rabbit-skin to wrap the baby bunting in.&quot;

== Evidence of earlier use ==

The only source known today that makes reference to hobbits in any sort of historical context is the &quot;Denham Tracts&quot; by Michael Denham. More specifically, it appears in James Hardy&#x27;s edition (London: Folklore Society, 1895), vol. 2, the second part of a two-volume set compiled from Denham&#x27;s publications between 1846 and 1859. The text contains a long list of sprites and bogies, based on an older list, the &quot;Discovery of Witchcraft&quot;, dated 1584, with many additions and a few repetitions. 
The term &quot;hobbit&quot; is listed in the context of &quot;boggleboes, bogies, redmen, portunes, grants, hobbits, hobgoblins, brown-men, cowies, dunnies&quot;.

The Tolkien researcher Mark T. Hooker catalogues a number of words with a silhouette similar to &quot;hobbit&quot;, including:

Hooker fails to find any of them &quot;an unambiguous source for the Hobbits of Middle-earth&quot;.

In the &quot;December 2003 Oxford English Dictionary newsletter&quot;, the following appears:

&quot;4. hobbit — J. R. R. Tolkien modestly claimed not to have coined this word, although the Supplement to the OED credited him with the invention of it in the absence of further evidence. It seems, however, that Tolkien was right to be cautious. It has since turned up in one of those 19th-century folklore journals, in a list of long-forgotten words for fairy-folk or little people. It seems likely that Tolkien, with his interest in folklore, read this and subconsciously registered the name, reviving it many years later in his most famous character. [Editor&#x27;s note: although revision of the OED&#x27;s entry for hobbit will of course take this evidence for earlier use into account, it does not yet appear in the online version of the entry.]&quot;

As of 2024 the entry had &quot;not yet been fully revised&quot; in the OED Online.

== Proprietary status ==

In 1968 United Artists acquired film and related merchandising rights to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Saul Zaentz bought the merchandising rights in 1976, vested in the Saul Zaentz Company (SZC; trade name &quot;Middle-earth Enterprises&quot;, formerly &quot;Tolkien Enterprises&quot;). SZC registered trademarks in various product categories for names related to elements of the novels.

The 1970s role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has humanoid races approximating Tolkien&#x27;s. The halfling race was called &quot;hobbit&quot; until changed after a 1977 lawsuit by Tolkien Enterprises in the run-up to the release of the animated film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. For the same reason, Dungeons &amp; Dragons &quot;ents&quot; were renamed treants; on the other hand elf, orc, and dwarf races were not renamed. Although the word &quot;halfling&quot; is used in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as an exonym of &quot;hobbit&quot;, it is not proprietary to Tolkien and an earlier published citation in the &quot;OED&quot; is from &quot;The Sword of Rhiannon&quot;. Later fantasy works also used &quot;halfling&quot; in a similar sense.

In 2008 SZC won a World Intellectual Property Organization case against a cybersquatter for control of the domain name and typosquat .

In 2012 Warner Bros. released &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; in association with SZC. To coincide with the release, a New Zealand scientist planned a public lecture on &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, an extinct human-like species discovered in 2003 and unofficially nicknamed &quot;the hobbit&quot; after its 2004 publication, because of its small stature. SZC refused permission to use the word &quot;hobbit&quot; in publicising the lecture. The same year, The Asylum tried to release a mockbuster film with the title &quot;Age of the Hobbits&quot;. SZC and Warner sued, alleging Asylum&#x27;s title was confusingly similar and violated its trademarks on the word &quot;hobbit&quot;. Asylum claimed that its film was about &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, &quot;uniformly referred to as &#x27;Hobbits&#x27; in the scientific community&quot;, and also cited the word &quot;hobbit&quot;&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;Denham Tracts&quot;. The U.S. District Court said Asylum&#x27;s evidence did not invalidate the trademark&#x27;s distinctiveness and granted an injunction; Asylum&#x27;s film was eventually released as &quot;Clash of the Empires&quot;.

Businesses to which SZC has sent cease-and-desist letters include the Hobbit Grille restaurant in Bonita Springs, Florida in 2007; The Hungry Hobbit café in Birmingham in 2011; a Scottish manufacturer of cylindrical timber lodges called &quot;hobbit houses&quot; in 2011; The Hobbit pub in Southampton in 2012; and an English wine importer called Giraffe and Hobbit in 2016. SZC offered a cheap copyright licence to the pub in response to online criticism of perceived excessive litigiousness. Hobbit Travel of Minnesota won a 2008 case against SZC on the ground of laches (unreasonable delay) as it had used the word &quot;hobbit&quot; in its name since 1976.

<text>The Detroit Committee to End the War in Vietnam (DCEWV) was the citywide anti-war organization that mobilized numerous actions in Detroit, United States between 1965 and 1973 and helped bring thousands of people to mass protests in Washington, D.C. Often there was internal conflict over slogans and politics within the group between social democrats, members of Students for a Democratic Society, and the Socialist Workers Party, which finally gained ascendency.

The DCEWV was supplanted by the Detroit Coalition to End the War Now, which was a broader organization.

Much of the history is available through contemporary reports in the Fifth Estate newspaper available at different archives including the University of Michigan&#x27;s Labadie Collection.

<text>In cryptography, ciphertext stealing (CTS) is a general method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of slightly increased complexity.

==General characteristics==
Ciphertext stealing is a technique for encrypting plaintext using a block cipher, without padding the message to a multiple of the block size, so the ciphertext is the same size as the plaintext.

It does this by altering processing of the last two blocks of the message. The processing of all but the last two blocks is unchanged, but a portion of the &quot;second&quot;-to-last block&#x27;s ciphertext is &quot;stolen&quot; to pad the last plaintext block. The padded final block is then encrypted as usual.

The final ciphertext, for the last two blocks, consists of the partial penultimate block (with the &quot;stolen&quot; portion omitted) plus the full final block, which are the same size as the original plaintext.

Decryption requires decrypting the final block first, then restoring the stolen ciphertext to the penultimate block, which can
then be decrypted as usual.

In principle any block-oriented block cipher mode of operation can be used, but stream-cipher-like modes can already be applied to messages of arbitrary length without padding, so they do not benefit from this technique. The common modes of operation that are coupled with ciphertext stealing are Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).

Ciphertext stealing for ECB mode requires the plaintext to be longer than one block. A possible workaround is to use a stream cipher-like block cipher mode of operation when the plaintext length is one block or less, such as the CTR, CFB or OFB modes.

Ciphertext stealing for CBC mode doesn&#x27;t necessarily require the plaintext to be longer than one block. In the case where the plaintext is one block long or less, the Initialization vector (IV) can act as the prior block of ciphertext. In this case a modified IV must be sent to the receiver. This may not be possible in situations where the IV can not be freely chosen by the sender when the ciphertext is sent (e.g., when the IV is a derived or pre-established value), and in this case ciphertext stealing for CBC mode can only occur in plaintexts longer than one block.

To implement CTS encryption or decryption for data of unknown length, the implementation must delay processing (and buffer) the two most recent blocks of data, so that they can be properly processed at the end of the data stream.

==Ciphertext format==
There are several different ways to arrange the ciphertext for transmission. The ciphertext bits are the same in all cases, just transmitted in a different order, so the choice has no security implications; it is purely one of implementation convenience.

The numbering here is taken from Dworkin, who describes them all. The third is the most popular, and described by Daemen and Schneier; Meyer describes a related, but incompatible scheme (with respect to bit ordering and key use).

===CS1===
Arguably the most obvious way to arrange the ciphertext is to transmit the truncated penultimate block, followed by the full final block. This is not convenient for the receiver for two reasons:
# The receiver must decrypt the final block first in any case, and
# This results in the final block not being aligned on a natural boundary, complicating hardware implementations.

This does have the advantage that, if the final plaintext block happens to be a multiple of the block size, the ciphertext is identical to that of the original mode of operation without ciphertext stealing.

===CS2===
It is often more convenient to swap the final two ciphertext blocks, so the ciphertext ends with the full final block, followed by the truncated penultimate block. This results in naturally aligned ciphertext blocks.

In order to maintain compatibility with the non-stealing modes, option CS2 performs this swap only if the amount of stolen ciphertext is non-zero, i.e. the original message was not a multiple of the block size.

This maintains natural alignment, and compatibility with the non-stealing modes, but requires treating the cases of aligned and unaligned message size differently.

===CS3===
The most popular alternative swaps the final two ciphertext blocks unconditionally. This is the ordering used in the descriptions below.

==Ciphertext stealing mode description==
In order to encrypt or decrypt data, use the standard block cipher mode of operation on all but the last two blocks of data.

The following steps describe how to handle the last two blocks of the plaintext, called &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where the length of &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 equals the block size of the cipher in bits, &quot;B&quot;; the length of the last block, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is &quot;M&quot; bits; and &quot;K&quot; is the key that is in use. &quot;M&quot; can range from 1 to &quot;B&quot;, inclusive, so &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; could possibly be a complete block. The CBC mode description also makes use of the ciphertext block just previous to the blocks concerned, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, which may in fact be the IV if the plaintext fits within two blocks.

For this description, the following functions and operators are used:
* Head (data, &quot;a&quot;): returns the first &quot;a&quot; bits of the &#x27;data&#x27; string.
* Tail (data, &quot;a&quot;): returns the last &quot;a&quot; bits of the &#x27;data&#x27; string.
* Encrypt (&quot;K&quot;, data): use the underlying block cipher in encrypt mode on the &#x27;data&#x27; string using the key &quot;K&quot;.
* Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, data): use the underlying block cipher in decrypt mode on the &#x27;data&#x27; string using the key &quot;K&quot;.
* XOR: Bitwise Exclusive-OR. Equivalent to bitwise addition without use of a carry bit.
* ||: Concatenation operator. Combine the strings on either side of the operator.
* 0&quot;a&quot;: a string of &quot;a&quot; 0 bits.

===ECB ciphertext stealing===
Ciphertext stealing in ECB mode introduces an inter-block dependency within the last two blocks, resulting in altered error propagation behavior for the last two blocks.

====ECB encryption steps (see figure) ====

# &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Encrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Encrypt &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard ECB mode.
# &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Head (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, &quot;M&quot;). Select the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The final ciphertext block, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is composed of the leading &quot;M&quot; bits of the second-to-last ciphertext block. In all cases, the last two blocks are sent in a different order than the corresponding plaintext blocks.
# &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; || Tail (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;). Pad &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; with the low order bits from &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1.
# &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Encrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Encrypt &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; to create &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. For the first &quot;M&quot; bits, this is equivalent to what would happen in ECB mode (other than the ciphertext ordering). For the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits, this is the second time that these data have been encrypted under this key (It was already encrypted in the production of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 in step 2).

====ECB decryption steps====
# &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Decrypt &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. This undoes step 4 of the encryption process.
# &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; || Tail (&quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;). Pad &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; with the extracted ciphertext in the tail end of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; (placed there in step 3 of the ECB encryption process).
# &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Head (&quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;M&quot;). Select the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; to create &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. As described in step 3 of the ECB encryption process, the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; contain &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. We queue this last (possibly partial) block for eventual output.
# &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Decrypt &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This reverses encryption step 1.

====ECB ciphertext stealing error propagation====
A bit error in the transmission of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 would result in the block-wide corruption of both &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
A bit error in the transmission of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; would result in the block-wide corruption of &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This is a significant change from ECB&#x27;s error propagation behavior.

===CBC ciphertext stealing===
In CBC, there is already interaction between processing of different adjacent blocks, so CTS has less conceptual impact in this mode. Error propagation is affected.

====CBC encryption steps====
# &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 XOR &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2. Exclusive-OR &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 with the previous ciphertext block, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, to create &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard CBC mode.
# &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Encrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Encrypt &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This is equivalent to the behavior of standard CBC mode.
# &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Head (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, &quot;M&quot;). Select the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The final ciphertext block, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is composed of the leading &quot;M&quot; bits of the second-to-last ciphertext block. In all cases, the last two blocks are sent in a different order than the corresponding plaintext blocks.
# &quot;P&quot; = &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; || 0&quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;. Pad &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; with zeros at the end to create &quot;P&quot; of length &quot;B&quot;. The zero padding in this step is important for step 5.
# &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 XOR &quot;P&quot;. Exclusive-OR &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 with &quot;P&quot; to create &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For the first &quot;M&quot; bits of the block, this is equivalent to CBC mode; the first &quot;M&quot; bits of the previous block&#x27;s ciphertext, &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, are XORed with the &quot;M&quot; bits of plaintext of the last plaintext block. The zero padding of &quot;P&quot; in step 4 was important, because it makes the XOR operation&#x27;s effect on the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits equivalent to copying the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to the end of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. These are the same bits that were stripped off of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 in step 3 when &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; was created.
# &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Encrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Encrypt &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; to create &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. For the first &quot;M&quot; bits, this is equivalent to what would happen in CBC mode (other than the ciphertext ordering). For the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits, this is the second time that these data have been encrypted under this key (It was already encrypted in the production of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 in step 2).

====CBC decryption steps====
# &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Decrypt &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. This undoes step 6 of the encryption process.
# &quot;C&quot; = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; || 0&quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;. Pad &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; with zeros at the end to create a block &quot;C&quot; of length &quot;B&quot;. We are padding &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; with zeros to help in step 3.
# &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; XOR &quot;C&quot;. Exclusive-OR &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; with &quot;C&quot; to create &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Looking at the first &quot;M&quot; bits, this step has the result of XORing &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; (the first &quot;M&quot; bits of the encryption process&#x27; &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1) with the (now decrypted) &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; XOR Head (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, &quot;M&quot;) (see steps 4-5 of the encryption process). In other words, we have CBC decrypted the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Looking at the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits, this recovers the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1.
# &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Head (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;M&quot;). Select the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; to create &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. As described in step 3, the first &quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; contain &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. We queue this last (possibly partial) block for eventual output.
# &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; || Tail (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;). Append the tail (&quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;) bits of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; to &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; to create &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. As described in step 3, &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 is composed of all of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; (which is &quot;M&quot; bits long) appended with the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;. We reassemble &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 (which is the same &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 seen in the encryption process) for processing in step 6.
# &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Decrypt &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to create &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. This reverses encryption step 2. &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 is the same as in the encryption process.
# &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 = &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 XOR &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2. Exclusive-OR &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 with the previous ciphertext block, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, to create &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. Finally, we reverse the XOR step from step 1 of the encryption process.

====CBC implementation notes====
For CBC ciphertext stealing, there is a clever (but opaque) method of implementing the described ciphertext stealing process using a standard CBC interface. Using this method imposes a performance penalty in the decryption stage of one extra block decryption operation over what would be necessary using a dedicated implementation.

=====CBC ciphertext stealing encryption using a standard CBC interface=====
# Pad the last partial plaintext block with 0.
# Encrypt the whole padded plaintext using the standard CBC mode.
# Swap the last two ciphertext blocks.
# Truncate the ciphertext to the length of the original plaintext.
=====CBC ciphertext stealing decryption using a standard CBC interface=====
# &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Decrypt (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1). Decrypt the second-to-last ciphertext block using ECB mode.
# &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; || Tail (&quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot;). Pad the ciphertext to the nearest multiple of the block size using the last &quot;B&quot;−&quot;M&quot; bits of block cipher decryption of the second-to-last ciphertext block.
# Swap the last two ciphertext blocks.
# Decrypt the (modified) ciphertext using the standard CBC mode.
# Truncate the plaintext to the length of the original ciphertext.
====CBC ciphertext stealing error propagation====
A bit error in the transmission of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 would result in the block-wide corruption of both &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
A bit error in the transmission of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; would result in a corresponding bit error in &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and in the block-wide corruption of &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1.

<text>The Regiment Huzaren van Sytzama was a Dutch armored regiment named for J.G. Baron van Sytzama, which was disbanded in 2012. Its origins may be traced to the French 14th Regiment of Cuirassiers which had in turn been formed from the Dutch 2nd Regiment of Cuirassiers in 1810. From these men, the Baron raised the regiment, later styled 1e Regiment Huzaren.

The Regiment Huzaren Prinses Catharina-Amalia, which is a company in the 414th Panzer Battalion, is a cavalry regiment formed in late 2020 through the amalgamation of three other Dutch cavalry regiments that, at the time, existed in suspension - the Regiment Huzaren Prins Alexander, Regiment Huzaren Van Sytzama and Regiment Huzaren Prins van Oranje.

==Tank Battalions==
*11th Tank Battalion which was activated on 6 January 1958, equipped with the British Centurion tank until August 1970, followed by the Leopard 1. In 1985 the Leopard 1V (improved) replaced the &quot;1&#x27;s&quot;. In 1993 the Leopard 1V was replaced by the Leopard 2A4. In April 1999 it was the last active user of the Leopard 2A4 and in that month it was replaced by the Leopard 2A5. In March 2004 the A5s were replaced with the Leopard 2A6. On 9 February 2012 the 11th tankbattalion was disbanded. It was based at Oirschot, North Brabant, the Netherlands
*12th Tank Battalion was activated in October 1957. In 1971 it received the Leopard 1 and in December 1985 the first Leopard 2A4s arrived to replace the Leopard 1s. In 2000 the unit was disbanded.
*43rd Tank Battalion was activated on 1 February 1963 at &#x27;t Harde, the Netherlands. in 1970 it received the first Leopard 1s. In July 1983 the unit received the Leopard 2A4. On 1 July 1992 the unit was disbanded at Langemannshof.
*49th Tank Battalion which was activated on 1 October 1972. Initially operating the Leopard 1 and from 1986 the Leopard 1V (improved). The unit was deactivated/disbanded on 1 January 1994. Its last location was the mobilisation complex at Schaarsbergen, the Netherlands.

<text>The 1921 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 9, 1921, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party of Saskatchewan of Premier William M. Martin was re-elected – although with a diminished share of the popular vote, and a reduced caucus in the legislature.

Donald McLean resigned as leader of the Conservative Party in April 1921, and the party convention decided to only form a committee to make arrangements for the coming election. There were only four candidates who were considered to have a chance of success, of which only two seats were retained. Its share of the popular vote fell from about 36% to less than 4%.

Harris Turner was instrumental in calling a meeting of Conservatives and separate school supporters to form an Independent Movement for the coming election. At a meeting held in Saskatoon in May 1921, it was decided not to establish a party structure, but to organize a central committee to field candidates. John Maharg, president of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers&#x27; Association and Minister of Agriculture in the Liberal government, would later accuse the movement of being engineered from the office of John Reid, the federal Minister of Railways. It appeared that the movement was effectively led by W.T. Badger, who was ostensibly campaigning as an Independent Conservative in Rosetown. Candidates in the movement included four Conservative, four Labour and four Non-Partisan figures.

The Independent and Independent Conservative candidates won over 29% of the vote, and voters elected a total of eight Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) under these banners.

The Progressive Party of Saskatchewan made its first appearance, winning six of the seven ridings that it contested.

==Expansion of Legislative Assembly==
An Act was passed in 1920 providing for an increase of seats from 59 to 63, upon the next election. Moose Jaw City, Regina City and Saskatoon City now returned two members instead of one, and the following other changes were made:

==Results==

<doc id="1161759" wikidata="Q4393533" url="?curid=1161759" title="Regiment van Heutsz">
<text>The Regiment van Heutsz is a line infantry regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army. The regiment was named after J.B. van Heutsz, a former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies who successfully brought the Aceh War closer to an end, and was formed on July 1, 1950. It is notable for its service as part of the United Nations force sent to fight during the Korean War. It is still operational and has served tours as part of the ISAF Afghanistan mission.

==Origin==

From 1832 to 1950 a substantial colonial army was maintained in the Dutch East Indies under the title of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL). Following Indonesian independence the Dutch and indigenous personnel of this force were demobilised but with the establishment of the Regiment van Heutsz on July 1, 1950, the traditions and distinctions of the KNIL were transferred to the new regiment. These included the inscription &#x27;Military Operations Royal Dutch East Indies Army 1816-1950&#x27;, still carried on the King&#x27;s Colour.

==Korean War==

The van Heutsz Regiment was incorporated into the (NDVN) (&quot;Netherlands Detachment United Nations&quot;), which also included the Dutch Naval component sent to Korea. While 16,225 people volunteered for service in Korea, only 3,418 men were accepted and sent. 2,980 of those participated in the actual war, as the units that arrived after the armistice (July 27, 1953) did not participate in any fighting.

The Korean War battalion of Regiment van Heutsz was formed on 9 September 1950. They left the Netherlands on October 26, 1950, and arrived Pusan on 23 November 1950, but took the detachment as its first battalion. The regiment has the battle honor &quot;Korea 1950–1954&quot; on its colors. In Korea, the van Heutsz troops (being understrength) were re-enforced by South Korean &quot;KATCOM&quot; troops. The Dutch served at three key battles, all around the Iron Triangle sector between 1951 and 1953.

Since the Regiment van Heutsz did not have its colors in 1950, a Dutch flag that was used in Korea as the battle flag of the &quot;Nederlands Detachement Verenigde Naties&quot; became the regimental colour. This flag now has official status and is shown on every parade and function of the regiment in tandem with the Sovereign&#x27;s Colour awarded years after (which makes the regiment the only one in the RNA to carry a UK-style strand of colours). American and Korean battle streamers, representing the US Presidential Unit Citation, are attached to this flag.

The Regiment suffered 116 Dutch and 20 attached-Korean soldiers killed in action, three soldiers are still MIA, while one Dutchman was taken prisoner and died in a North Korean POW camp. The Dutch casualties are buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, including their commander, Lt. Col. Marinus Petrus Antonius den Ouden, who was killed in action during the Battle of Hoengsong in February 1951 (Den Ouden posthumously received the Netherlands&#x27; highest military award, the Military Order of William). A total of 381 soldiers were wounded. A total of 115 Surinamese soldiers also fought together with the Dutch, at least two died.

==Post Korean service and ISAF deployment==
The traditions of the Regiment van Heutsz are currently maintained by one battalion serving as part of 11 Luchtmobiele (Airmobile) Brigade:

*12th Ranger Battalion RVH (formerly 12th Infantry Battalion 1st RVH) is one of three air assault infantry battalions within the air mobile brigade

From 2006 to 2010, the battalion formed the basis of the battlegroup attached to Task Force Uruzgan, the primary Dutch component of the multi-national forces in Afghanistan. For this, the regiment was awarded with the battle honour &quot;Noord-Kandahar 2006 en Uruzgan 2006-2009&quot; for operations in Afghanistan, especially for combat operations in 2006 and 2007, the operation Tura Ghar in 2008-2009 and the actions of the doorgunners between 2006 and 2009.

<text>The 1925 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 2, 1925, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party of Saskatchewan – under its new leader, Charles A. Dunning – won its sixth consecutive victory, and continued to dominate the legislature.

The Progressive Party of Saskatchewan increased its share of the vote from 7.5% to over 23%, but failed to add to its six member caucus.

The Conservative Party of James Anderson also increased its vote by over 14%, but only increased its representation in the legislature from two to three members.

The increase in the Progressive and Conservative vote came from voters who had supported independent candidates in the 1921 election.

<doc id="1161770" wikidata="Q4752075" url="?curid=1161770" title="Anatole Broyard">
<text>Anatole Paul Broyard (July 16, 1920 – October 11, 1990) was an American writer, literary critic, and editor who wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In addition to his many reviews and columns, he published short stories, essays, and two books during his lifetime. His autobiographical works, &quot;Intoxicated by My Illness&quot; (1992) and &quot;Kafka Was the Rage: A Greenwich Village Memoir&quot; (1993), were published after his death.

Several years after his death, Broyard became the center of controversy when it was revealed that he had &quot;passed&quot; as white despite being a Louisiana Creole of mixed-race ancestry.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Anatole Paul Broyard was born on July 16, 1920, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a Black Louisiana Creole family, the son of Paul Anatole Broyard, a carpenter and construction worker, and his wife, Edna Miller, neither of whom had finished elementary school. Broyard was descended from ancestors who were established as free people of color before the Civil War. Documents in the Louisiana state archives show all of Broyard&#x27;s ancestors, on both sides, to have been Black, at least since the late eighteenth century, while the first Broyard recorded in Louisiana was a French colonist in the mid-eighteenth century. Broyard was the second of three children; he and his sister Lorraine, two years older, were light-skinned with European features. Their younger sister, Shirley, who eventually married Franklin Williams, an attorney and civil rights leader, had darker skin and African features.

When Broyard was a child during the Depression, his family moved from New Orleans to New York City, as part of the Great Migration of African Americans to the northern industrial cities. According to his daughter, Bliss Broyard, &quot;My mother said that when my father was growing up in Brooklyn, where his family had moved when he was six, he&#x27;d been ostracized by both white and black kids alike. The black kids picked on him because he looked white, and the white kids rejected him because they knew his family was black. He&#x27;d come home from school with his jacket torn, and his parents wouldn&#x27;t ask what happened. My mother said that he didn&#x27;t tell us about his racial background because he wanted to spare his own children from going through what he did.&quot;

The Broyard family lived in a working-class and racially diverse community in Brooklyn. He saw his parents &quot;pass&quot; as white to get work, as his father found the carpenters union to be racially discriminatory. By high school, the younger Broyard had become interested in artistic and cultural life.

Broyard had some stories accepted for publication in the 1940s. He began studying at Brooklyn College before the U.S. entered World War II. When he enlisted in the Army, the armed services were segregated and no African Americans were officers. He was accepted as white at enlistment and he successfully completed officers school. During his service, Broyard was promoted to the rank of captain.

After the war, Broyard maintained his white identity. He used the GI Bill to study at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan.

===Career===
Broyard settled in Greenwich Village, where he became part of its bohemian artistic and literary life. With money saved during the war, Broyard owned a bookstore for a time. As he recounted in a 1979 column:
Eventually, I ran away to Greenwich Village, where no one had been born of a mother and father, where the people I met had sprung from their own brows, or from the pages of a bad novel... Orphans of the avant-garde, we outdistanced our history and our humanity.

Broyard did not identify with or champion black political causes. Because of his artistic ambition, he tended not to acknowledge that he was black. Charlie Parker once said of Broyard, “He’s one of us, but he doesn’t want to admit he’s one of us.” On the other hand, Margaret Harrell has written that she and other acquaintances were casually told that he was a writer and black before meeting him, and not in the sense of having to keep it secret. That he was black was well known in the Greenwich Village literary and art community from the early 1960s.

As writer and editor Brent Staples wrote in 2003, &quot;Anatole Broyard wanted to be a writer – and not just a &#x27;Negro writer&#x27; consigned to the back of the literary bus.&quot; The historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. wrote: &quot;In his terms, he did not want to write about black love, black passion, black suffering, black joy; he wanted to write about love and passion and suffering and joy.&quot;

During the 1940s to early 1960s, Broyard published stories in &quot;Modern Writing&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, and &quot;New World Writing&quot;, three leading pocket-book format &quot;little magazines&quot;. He also contributed articles and essays to &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;Neurotica&quot;, and New Directions Publishing. Stories of his were included in two anthologies of fiction widely associated with the Beat writers, but Broyard did not identify with them.

Broyard often was said to be working on a novel, but never published one. After the 1950s, Broyard taught creative writing at The New School, New York University, and Columbia University, in addition to his regular book reviewing. For nearly fifteen years, Broyard wrote daily book reviews for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The editor John Leonard was quoted as saying, &quot;A good book review is an act of seduction, and when he [Broyard] did it there was no one better.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Broyard started publishing brief personal essays in the &quot;Times&quot;, which many people considered among his best work. These were collected in &quot;Men, Women and Anti-Climaxes&quot;, published in 1980. In 1984 Broyard was given a column in the &quot;Book Review&quot;, for which he also worked as an editor. He was among those considered &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in the New York literary world, whose positive opinions were critical to a writer&#x27;s success.

===Marriage and family===

Broyard first married Aida Sanchez, a Puerto Rican woman, and they had a daughter, Gala. They divorced after Broyard returned from military service in World War II.

In 1961, at the age of 40, Broyard married again, to Alexandra (Sandy) Nelson, a modern dancer and younger woman of Norwegian-American ancestry. They had two children: son Todd, born in 1964, and daughter Bliss, born in 1966. The Broyards raised their children as white in suburban Connecticut. The social critic Ernest Van den Haag, a close friend of Broyard&#x27;s, said, “I do think it’s not without significance that Anatole married a blonde, and about as white as you can get. He may have feared a little bit that the children might turn out black. He must have been pleased that they didn’t.” When they had grown to young adults, Sandy urged Broyard to tell them about his family (and theirs), but he refused.

Shortly before he died, Broyard stated that he missed his friend Milton Klonsky, with whom he used to talk every day, after Klonsky&#x27;s death. Broyard said that after Milton died, &quot;no one talked to me as an equal&quot;.

Broyard&#x27;s first wife and child were not mentioned in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary. Sandy told their children of their father&#x27;s ancestry before his death.

===Death===
Broyard died of prostate cancer on October 11, 1990, at the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

==Disclosure of African-American ancestry==
In 1996, six years after Broyard&#x27;s death, Henry Louis Gates profiled the writer in a piece called &quot;White Like Me&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, detailing how Broyard concealed the truth about his African-American ancestry. (Gates included the profile, as a chapter titled &quot;The Passing of Anatole Broyard,&quot; in his 1997 book &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man&quot;.) While Gates documented the many ways that Broyard deceived friends and family by &quot;passing&quot; as white, he also expressed sympathy for Broyard&#x27;s literary ambition. He wrote:
When those of mixed ancestry—and the majority of blacks are of mixed ancestry—disappear into the white majority, they are traditionally accused of running from their &quot;blackness.&quot; Yet why isn&#x27;t the alternative a matter of running from their &quot;whiteness&quot;?

In 2007, Broyard&#x27;s daughter, Bliss, published a memoir, &quot;One Drop: My Father&#x27;s Hidden Life: A Story of Race and Family Secrets&quot;. The title related to the &quot;one-drop rule.&quot; Adopted into law in most southern states in the early twentieth century, it divided society into two groups, whites and blacks, classifying all persons with any known black ancestry as black.

==Cultural references==
Novelist Chandler Brossard, who knew Broyard in the late 1940s, based a character on him in his first novel, &quot;Who Walk in Darkness&quot; (1952). After the manuscript was submitted to New Directions Publishing, poet Delmore Schwartz read it and informed Broyard that the character Henry Porter was based on him; Broyard threatened to sue unless the novel&#x27;s opening line was changed. It originally had read &quot;People said Henry Porter was a &#x27;passed Negro,&#x27;&quot; which Brossard reluctantly changed to &quot;People said Henry Porter was an illegitimate.&quot; Brossard restored his original text for a 1972 paperback edition.

Novelist William Gaddis, who likewise knew Broyard in the late 1940s, modeled a character named &quot;Max&quot; on Broyard in his first novel, &quot;The Recognitions&quot; (1955).

Given Broyard&#x27;s stature in the literary world and discussions about his life after his death, numerous literary critics, such as Michiko Kakutani, Janet Maslin, Lorrie Moore, Charles Taylor, Touré, and Brent Staples, have made comparisons between the character Coleman Silk in Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;The Human Stain&quot; (2000) and Broyard. Some speculated that Roth had been inspired by Broyard&#x27;s life, and commented on the larger issues of race and identity in American society. Roth stated in a 2008 interview, however, that Broyard was not his source of inspiration. He explained that he had only learned about Broyard&#x27;s black ancestry and choices from the Gates &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, published months after he had already started writing the novel.

<text>The Regiment Stoottroepen Prins Bernhard is an infantry regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army.

The Regiment Stoottroepen was founded on 21 September 1944 in Eindhoven, and composed of members of the Dutch resistance from those parts of the Netherlands that had been recently liberated from German occupation. The formation took place on the orders of Prince Bernhard, in his capacity as Commander of the Dutch armed forces. By the time of the surrender of the last German forces in the Netherlands, on 5 May 1945, the regiment had grown to some 6,000 men.

Following the liberation of the Netherlands, the regiment was incorporated into the RNLA, and it component battalions took part in the police actions in the Dutch East Indies 1946–1949. During the 1950s, the Dutch army underwent reorganisation, and the Regiment Stoottropen was reduced to one battalion, 41 Infantry Battalion. In due course, this unit was converted to mechanized infantry (Dutch: &quot;pantserinfanteriebataljon&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;painfbat&quot;).

In 1994, 41 Painfbat was deactivated, and the lineage and colours of the Regiment Stoottroepen were taken over by 13 Infantry Battalion and 11 Mortar Company, both of which form part of 11 Luchtmobiele (Airmobile) Brigade. Following the death of Prince Bernhard in 2004, the regiment was renamed &quot;Regiment Stoottroepen Prins Bernhard&quot; in his honour. In 2011 the Charlie Company took over the traditions of the ‘Margrietcompagnie’.

<doc id="1161775" wikidata="Q15008046" url="?curid=1161775" title="Log driving">
<text>Log driving is a means of moving logs (sawn tree trunks) from a forest to sawmills and pulp mills downstream using the current of a river. It was the main transportation method of the early logging industry in Europe and North America.

==History==

When the first sawmills were established, they were usually small water-powered facilities located near the source of timber, which might be converted to grist mills after farming became established when the forests had been cleared. Later, bigger circular sawmills were developed in the lower reaches of a river, with the logs floated down to them by log drivers. In the broader, slower stretches of a river, the logs might be bound together into timber rafts. In the smaller, wilder stretches of a river where rafts couldn&#x27;t get through, masses of individual logs were driven down the river like huge herds of cattle. &quot;Log floating&quot; in Sweden (&quot;timmerflottning&quot;) had begun by the 16th century, and 17th century in Finland (&quot;tukinuitto&quot;). The total length of timber-floating routes in Finland was 40,000km.
The log drive was one step in a larger process of lumber-making in remote places. In a location with snowy winters, the yearly process typically began in autumn when a small team of men hauled tools upstream into the timbered area, chopped out a clearing, and constructed crude buildings for a logging camp. In the winter when things froze, a larger crew moved into the camp and proceeded to cut trees, cutting the trunks into lengths, and hauling the logs with oxen or horses over iced trails to the riverbank. There the logs were decked onto &quot;rollways.&quot; In spring when snow thawed and water levels rose, the logs were rolled into the river, and the drive commenced.

To ensure that logs drifted freely along the river, men called &quot;log drivers&quot; or &quot;river pigs&quot; were needed to guide the logs. The drivers typically divided into two groups. The more experienced and nimble men comprised the &quot;jam&quot; crew or &quot;beat&quot; crew. They watched the spots where logs were likely to jam, and when a jam started, tried to get to it quickly and dislodge the key logs before many logs stacked up. If they didn&#x27;t, the river would keep piling on more logs, forming a partial dam which could raise the water level. Millions of board feet of lumber could back up for miles upriver, requiring weeks to break up, with some timber lost if it was shoved far enough into the shallows. When the jam crew saw a jam begin, they rushed to it and tried to break it up, using peaveys and possibly dynamite. This job required some understanding of physics, strong muscles, and extreme agility. The jam crew was an exceedingly dangerous occupation, with the drivers standing on the moving logs and running from one to another. Many drivers lost their lives by falling and being crushed by the logs.
Each crew was accompanied by an experienced boss often selected for his fighting skills to control the strong and reckless men of his team. The overall drive was controlled by the &quot;walking boss&quot; who moved from place to place to coordinate the various teams to keep logs moving past problem spots. Stalling a drive near a saloon often created a cascade of drunken personnel problems.

A larger group of less experienced men brought up the rear, pushing along the straggler logs that were stuck on the banks and in trees. They spent more time wading in icy water than balancing on moving logs. They were called the &quot;rear crew.&quot; Other men worked with them from the bank, pushing logs away with pike poles. Others worked with horses and oxen to pull in the logs that had strayed furthest out into the flats.

Bateaux ferried log drivers using pike poles to dislodge stranded logs while maneuvering with the log drive. A wannigan was a kitchen built on a raft which followed the drivers down the river. The wannigan served four meals a day to fuel the men working in cold water. It also provided tents and blankets for the night if no better accommodations were available. A commissary wagon carrying clothing, plug tobacco and patent medicines for purchase by the log drivers was also called a wangan. The logging company wangan train, called a &quot;Mary Anne&quot;, was a caravan of wagons pulled by four- or six-horse teams where roads followed the river to transport the tents, blankets, food, stoves, and tools needed by the log drivers.

For log drives, the ideal river would have been straight and uniform, with sharp banks and a predictable flow of water. Wild rivers were not that, so men cut away the fallen trees that would snag logs, dynamited troublesome rocks, and built up the banks in places. To control the flow of water, they built &quot;flash dams&quot; or &quot;driving dams&quot; on smaller streams, so they could release water to push the logs down when they wanted.

Each timber firm had its own mark which was placed on the logs, called an &quot;end mark&quot;. Obliterating or altering a timber mark was a crime. At the mill the logs were captured by a log boom, and the logs were sorted for ownership before being sawn.

Log drives were often in conflict with navigation, as logs would sometimes fill the entire river and make boat travel dangerous or impossible.

Floating logs down a river worked well for the most desirable pine timber, because it floated well. But hardwoods were more dense, and weren&#x27;t buoyant enough to be easily driven, and some pines weren&#x27;t near drivable streams. Log driving became increasingly unnecessary with the development of railroads and the use of trucks on logging roads. However, the practice survived in some remote locations where such infrastructure did not exist. Most log driving in the US and Canada ended with changes in environmental legislation in the 1970s. Some places, like the Catalan Pyrenees, still retain the practice as a popular holiday celebration once a year.

In Sweden legal exemptions for log driving were eliminated in 1983. &quot;The last float in southern Sweden was in the 1960s, with the floating era in the rest of the country ending completely with the last of the many log drives in the Klarälven river in 1991.&quot;

* The contemporary logrolling contest, Birling, is a demonstration of skills originally devised by log drivers.
* Inclusive description of a complex assortment as &quot;the whole Mary Anne&quot; derives from the colorful characters of wangan caravans which periodically transformed quiet rural communities with the excitement of a passing log drive.
* In Canada, &quot;The Log Driver&#x27;s Waltz&quot; is a popular folk song which boasts about a log driver&#x27;s dancing skills.
* The version of the Canadian one-dollar bank note issued in 1974 and withdrawn in 1989 featured a view of the Ottawa River with log driving taking place in the foreground and Parliament Hill rising in the background. This banknote was part of the fourth series of banknotes released by the Bank of Canada entitled &quot;Scenes of Canada&quot;. The logs depicted in this bank note may have been destined for a half dozen pulp, paper and sawmills near the Chaudière Falls immediately upstream from Parliament Hill, or for other mills further downstream.
* An Englishman may have observed loggers loitering in Bangor, Maine when he reported in 1801: &quot;His habits in the forest and the [river] voyage all break up the system of persevering industry and substitute one of alternate toil and indolence, hardship and debauch; and in the alteration, indolence and debauch will inevitably be indulged in the greatest possible proportion.&quot;
* In the first chapter of &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1985), John Irving briefly describes a 1930s log drive.

<text>The Nokia 6110 was a GSM mobile phone from Nokia announced on 18 December 1997 and released in 1998. It is not to be confused with the newer Nokia 6110 Navigator. It was a hugely popular follower of the Nokia 2110, and the first of the many Nokia 6xxx series business-targeted phones. Main improvements over the 2110 were reduced size and improved talk time. It was the first GSM phone to use an ARM processor, as well as the first running on Nokia&#x27;s Series 20 user interface.

The phone shared the same platform as the Nokia 5110 targeted at the consumer market; unlike the 5110, however, it had the advanced user interface with menu icons (it was the first phone with this new interface that would become the future standard), and featured an infra-red port (once again being Nokia&#x27;s first phone with it). It was also the first phone from Nokia to have the popular &quot;Snake&quot; game pre-installed.

It was succeeded/complemented by the similar but enhanced [[Nokia 6150|6150]].

==Variants==

Nokia 6190 is a version of the phone for the North American market, although the infra-red port was removed. Several non-GSM variants were also released aimed at the North American market, including the 800 MHz D-AMPS 6120 (not to be confused with the Nokia 6120 classic), the 800/1900 MHz D-AMPS 6160, and the 800/1900 MHz CDMA 6185. This was also known as the NK702 on the Orange UK network with a slightly different fascia, however the inside was identical. The GSM 1800 MHz variant was labeled 6130 and had the same exterior design changes, as the dual band GSM 900/1800 MHz 6150 model.

A license-built variant of the 6120 was manufactured and marketed by Gradiente in Brazil as the Gradiente Concept.

<doc id="1161784" wikidata="Q1760728" url="?curid=1161784" title="Link (knot theory)">
<text>In mathematical knot theory, a link is a collection of knots that do not intersect, but which may be linked (or knotted) together. A knot can be described as a link with one component. Links and knots are studied in a branch of mathematics called knot theory. Implicit in this definition is that there is a &quot;trivial&quot; reference link, usually called the unlink, but the word is also sometimes used in context where there is no notion of a trivial link. 

For example, a co-dimension 2 link in 3-dimensional space is a subspace of 3-dimensional Euclidean space (or often the 3-sphere) whose connected components are homeomorphic to circles. 

The simplest nontrivial example of a link with more than one component is called the Hopf link, which consists of two circles (or unknots) linked together once. The circles in
the Borromean rings are collectively linked despite the fact that no two of them are directly linked. The Borromean rings thus form a Brunnian link and in fact constitute the simplest such link.

== Generalizations ==
The notion of a link can be generalized in a number of ways.

=== General manifolds ===
Frequently the word link is used to describe any submanifold of the sphere formula_1 diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of a finite number of spheres, formula_2. 

In full generality, the word link is essentially the same as the word &quot;knot&quot; – the context is that one has a submanifold &quot;M&quot; of a manifold &quot;N&quot; (considered to be trivially embedded) and a non-trivial embedding of &quot;M&quot; in &quot;N&quot;, non-trivial in the sense that the 2nd embedding is not isotopic to the 1st. If &quot;M&quot; is disconnected, the embedding is called a link (or said to be linked). If &quot;M&quot; is connected, it is called a knot.

=== Tangles, string links, and braids ===

While (1-dimensional) links are defined as embeddings of circles, it is often interesting and especially technically useful to consider embedded intervals (strands), as in braid theory.

Most generally, one can consider a tangle – a tangle is an embedding 
:formula_3

of a (smooth) compact 1-manifold with boundary formula_4 into the plane times the interval formula_5 such that the boundary formula_6 is embedded in 
:formula_7 (formula_8).

The type of a tangle is the manifold &quot;X,&quot; together with a fixed embedding of formula_9

Concretely, a connected compact 1-manifold with boundary is an interval formula_10 or a circle formula_11 (compactness rules out the open interval formula_12 and the half-open interval formula_13 neither of which yields non-trivial embeddings since the open end means that they can be shrunk to a point), so a possibly disconnected compact 1-manifold is a collection of &quot;n&quot; intervals formula_10 and &quot;m&quot; circles formula_15 The condition that the boundary of &quot;X&quot; lies in 
:formula_7

says that intervals either connect two lines or connect two points on one of the lines, but imposes no conditions on the circles.
One may view tangles as having a vertical direction (&quot;I&quot;), lying between and possibly connecting two lines 
:(formula_17 and formula_18),

and then being able to move in a two-dimensional horizontal direction (formula_19) 

between these lines; one can project these to form a tangle diagram, analogous to a knot diagram.

Tangles include links (if &quot;X&quot; consists of circles only), braids, and others besides – for example, a strand connecting the two lines together with a circle linked around it.

In this context, a braid is defined as a tangle which is always going down – whose derivative always has a non-zero component in the vertical (&quot;I&quot;) direction. In particular, it must consist solely of intervals, and not double back on itself; however, no specification is made on where on the line the ends lie.

A string link is a tangle consisting of only intervals, with the ends of each strand required to lie at (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), ... – i.e., connecting the integers, and ending in the same order that they began (one may use any other fixed set of points); if this has &quot;ℓ&quot; components, we call it an &quot;&quot;ℓ&quot;-component string link&quot;. A string link need not be a braid – it may double back on itself, such as a two-component string link that features an overhand knot. A braid that is also a string link is called a pure braid, and corresponds with the usual such notion.

The key technical value of tangles and string links is that they have algebraic structure. Isotopy classes of tangles form a tensor category, where for the category structure, one can compose two tangles if the bottom end of one equals the top end of the other (so the boundaries can be stitched together), by stacking them – they do not literally form a category (pointwise) because there is no identity, since even a trivial tangle takes up vertical space, but up to isotopy they do. The tensor structure is given by juxtaposition of tangles – putting one tangle to the right of the other.

For a fixed &quot;ℓ,&quot; isotopy classes of &quot;ℓ&quot;-component string links form a monoid (one can compose all &quot;ℓ&quot;-component string links, and there is an identity), but not a group, as isotopy classes of string links need not have inverses. However, &quot;concordance&quot; classes (and thus also &quot;homotopy&quot; classes) of string links do have inverses, where inverse is given by flipping the string link upside down, and thus form a group.

Every link can be cut apart to form a string link, though this is not unique, and invariants of links can sometimes be understood as invariants of string links – this is the case for Milnor&#x27;s invariants, for instance. Compare with closed braids.

<text>The [[Nokia]] 7110 is a GSM mobile phone announced in February 1999 and released in October 1999.
It was the first mobile phone to run Series 40 and to come with a WAP browser.

==Variants==

===Nokia 7110 (NSE-5)===

The basic version, intended to be used in European GSM networks. It works in GSM 900/1800.

===Nokia 7160 (NSW-5)===

This version intended to be used in TDMA/AMPS networks. It works in TDMA 850/1900 and AMPS 850.

===Nokia 7190 (NSB-5)===

This version intended to be used in American GSM networks. It works in GSM 1900.

==Features==

The 7110 was Nokia&#x27;s second handset with a sliding cover that could be used to answer and terminate voice calls. As with the 8110 before, with the cover deployed, the microphone was brought closer to the user&#x27;s mouth, improving the clarity of the voice reception. New to the 7110 was a spring-powered release mechanism, which would release the cover when a small metal catch on the rear of the handset was depressed. The cover could also be opened manually.

Connectivity is provided via a standard IrDA transceiver on the top edge of the handset. A serial cable can also be attached to the handset&#x27;s expansion terminal, to allow synchronization of the phone&#x27;s contents, and to allow the phone to function as a Modem. Data capabilities are limited to circuit switched data; GPRS was not available on this handset. The WAP mini-browser established a connection to the internet using CSD.

The navi-roller was used in place of the familiar up and down buttons, allowing the user to rapidly scroll through lists of options; depressing the roller selected the currently highlighted option.

The 7110 was the first cellular phone to implement the T9 Predictive text input method for composing SMS messages, but the 3210 was the first phone to combine both T9 and internal antenna.

Contrary to popular myth, although the Nokia 7110 does feature a spring-loaded cover concealing the keypad; this is not the model featured in the first &quot;Matrix&quot; movie, which is the Nokia 8110 (made three years prior), which was adapted with a spring mechanism to feature in the 1999 film.

<doc id="1161795" wikidata="Q213615" url="?curid=1161795" title="Otto Abetz">
<text>Otto Friedrich Abetz (26 March 1903 – 5 May 1958) was a German diplomat, a Nazi official and a convicted war criminal during World War II.

Abetz joined the Nazi Party and the SA in the early 1930s later becoming a member of the SS. Abetz played a significant role in strengthening ties between Nazi Germany and Vichy France during World War II. In 1940, after the German occupation of France, he was appointed German ambassador to France. Abetz played a significant role in strengthening ties between Nazi Germany and the collaborationist Vichy government.

Abetz played a significant role in facilitating the persecution and deportation of Jews by the Nazi regime from France during the Holocaust. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945, Abetz was captured and later stood trial at the Nuremberg Trials. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in 1954 for health reasons and died in a car crash in 1958.

==Early years==
Abetz was born in Schwetzingen on 26 March 1903. He was the son of an estate manager, who died when he was 13. Abetz graduated in Karlsruhe, where he became an art teacher at a girls&#x27; school.

He joined the Hitler Youth where he became a close friend of Joachim von Ribbentrop. He was one of the founders of the Reichsbanner, the paramilitary arm of the Social Democrats, and was associated with groups such as the Black Front, a group of dissident National Socialists associated with Otto Strasser.

In his twenties Abetz started a Franco-German cultural group for youths, along with Jean Luchaire, known as &quot;the Sohlberg Congress&quot;. The group brought together German and French youth of all professions, social classes, political leanings, and religious affiliation. The group held their first conference in the Black Forest, and were frequently convened around ski slopes, campfires, and in hostels. The group maintained relations with the media through Luchaire&#x27;s connection to &quot;Notre Temps&quot;, and Abetz started the Sohlberg Circle (&quot;Sohlbergkreis&quot;). In 1934 the Sohlberg Circle was reborn as the Franco-German Committee (Comité France-Allemagne), which included Pierre Drieu la Rochelle and Jacques Benoist-Mechin.

Abetz married Luchaire&#x27;s French secretary, Susanne de Bruyker, in 1932. His politics were leftist, and he was known as a pacifist who bridged differences with fascists.

==National Socialist period==
Abetz &quot;pledged his support&quot; for the NSDAP in 1931 and formally joined in 1937, the year he applied for the German Foreign Service. From 1938, he was representing Germany in Paris and joined the masonic lodge &quot;Goethe&quot; in 1939.

Abetz attended the Munich Conference in 1938. He was expelled from France in June 1939 following allegations he had bribed two French newspaper editors to write pro-German articles; his expulsion created a scandal in France when it emerged that the wife of the French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet was a close friend of the two editors, which led to much lurid speculation in the French press that Bonnet had received bribes from Abetz, though no firm evidence has ever emerged to support the rumours.

Abetz was present in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s entourage at the fall of Warsaw, and served as a translator for the German Führer. He returned to France in June 1940 following the German occupation and was assigned by Joachim von Ribbentrop to the embassy in Paris.

Following Hitler&#x27;s June 30 directive, Abetz was assigned by Ribbentrop the looting of all objects of art, public, private, and especially Jewish-owned. Abetz announced to the Wehrmacht that the embassy had been &quot;charged with the seizure of French works of art... and with the listing and seizure of works owned by Jews.&quot; On 17 September 1940 Hitler allowed Einsatzstab Rosenberg to take part and push Abetz out. The Pétain government protested Abetz&#x27;s undertakings in late October, but by the end of October so much material had accumulated at the Louvre that it was decided more space was needed.

In November 1940 Abetz was appointed to the German Embassy in Paris, in occupied France, at the age of 37 – a post he held until July 1944. He was also head of the French fifth columnists through Ribbentrop&#x27;s special unit within the Foreign Service.

He advised the German military administration in Paris and was responsible for dealing with the Vichy Government. In May 1941, he negotiated the Paris Protocols to expand German access to French military facilities.

Abetz&#x27;s antisemitic beliefs were a pivotal factor in his personal recruitment by Adolf Hitler. It was Abetz who proposed the deportation of stateless Jews to France&#x27;s unoccupied zone and later to extermination camps in the East. Abetz assumed a prominent role in the deportation process, targeting both foreign Jewish refugees and French-born Jews, particularly after the occupation of southern France by Germany. On July 2, 1942, Abetz advocated for the deportation of 40,000 Jews from France to Auschwitz in a telegram, emphasising the need for comprehensive measures within both the occupied and unoccupied zones. This marked a turning point in his involvement in the holocaust.

Abetz&#x27;s primary objective was to secure complete collaboration from the French, through negotiations with Laval and Admiral Darlan. Abetz&#x27;s function eventually evolved into becoming the catalyst for society, the arts, industry, education, and above all, propaganda. He played a pivotal role in the appointment of Pierre Drieu la Rochelle as director of La Nouvelle Revue française, which allowed him to exert direct influence in shaping French literature. In addition to running the German embassy in Paris, Abetz acquired the Château de Chantilly in the countryside. He often entertained guests in both these places, living and working like a self-styled autocrat. One of the guests, the French writer Louis-Ferdinand Céline, jokingly referred to him as &quot;King Otto I&quot;, and France as &quot;the Kingdom of Otto&quot;.

The Embassy was theoretically responsible for all political questions in occupied France, which included SD operations, and for advising the German police and military. Abetz advised the military, the Gestapo and the SD. As the official representative of the German Government with the rank of SS-Standartenführer (Colonel), he created the German Institute headed by Karl Epting. Thirty thousand people signed up for the Institute&#x27;s German language courses, the Institute&#x27;s concerts featured Germany&#x27;s best musicians, including Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

Following the occupation of all France on 11 November 1942, von Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence diminished as all of France was run by German military authorities, in conjunction with military police. A NSDAP Reichskommissariat of Belgien-Nordfrankreich held sway in several northern departments. Von Ribbentrop recalled Abetz in November following the occupation of all France. In his memoirs, Abetz assumed that he was considered &quot;too francophile&quot; and that his constant warnings about the loss of the French fleet and the loss of the French North Africa colonies were a thorn in the side of von Ribbentrop. The scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon on 27 November had ensured that the French would not join the Axis.

Abetz left France in September 1944 as the German armies withdrew, this despite claiming to Swedish consul-general Raoul Nordling on the seventh of the previous month that the Germans had neither killed political prisoners nor were making any plans to leave Paris.

==Trial, conviction and death==
Abetz was arrested by Allied authorities in the Schwarzwald in October 1945. In the announcement of his arrest in &quot;France Soir&quot;, he was quoted as saying that Adolf Hitler was &quot;certainly not dead&quot;, and &quot;would return&quot;. A French court sentenced Abetz to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment for crimes against humanity. He was released from Loos prison on 17 April 1954.

He died on May 5, 1958, on the Cologne-Ruhr autobahn after being burned to death in an accident, involving his speeding car near Langenfeld. His death may have been a revenge killing for his role in the Holocaust. His wife also died in the accident. The car&#x27;s steering failed and the ultimate cause of the accident could not be fully determined. The car had recently been given to him as a gift from a Frenchman.

==Relatives==
A great-nephew, Eric Abetz, is an Australian conservative and a Liberal Party former member of the Australian Senate, and was at one time a cabinet minister in the government of Tony Abbott and since 2024 a member of the Tasmanian Parliament. One of Eric&#x27;s brothers, another great-nephew, the Reverend Peter Abetz, was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, also representing the Liberal Party. Eric Abetz has publicly distanced himself from his Nazi relative.

<text>The 3110 is a GSM mobile phone handset manufactured by Nokia in Hungary, introduced at CEBIT in March 12, 1997. The 3110 is notable as the first Nokia handset to feature the &#x27;Navi-Key&#x27; (a.k.a. D-Pad) menu navigation system. The Navi-Key was featured heavily on Nokia handsets, especially the entry-level models such as the Nokia 1100 in the following years. Unlike its successor, the 3210, and subsequent handsets of similar design, the 3110 had an external antenna. The phone was available with a slim, standard or vibrating battery. It could only be used on a GSM-900 network.

The 3110 shared the platform and accessories of the Nokia 8110 &quot;banana phone&quot;.

The model number was reused by Nokia in 2007 when the company launched the Nokia 3110 classic. The 3110 classic sports a candybar form factor similar to that of the 3110, but adds modern features such as Bluetooth, camera functionality, audio and video playback and recording, and packet data over EDGE, in addition to tri-band functionality.

Unlike subsequent 3000 series mobile phones, its display is not PCD8544 based.

==Features and specification==
The 3110 was clearly aimed at business users, with notable features including PC synchronisation, good battery life and conservative black styling.
