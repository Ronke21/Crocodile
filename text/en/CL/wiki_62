<text>Westbury is a market town and civil parish in west Wiltshire, England. The town lies below the northwestern edge of Salisbury Plain, about south of Trowbridge and a similar distance north of Warminster. 

Westbury was known for the annual Hill Fair where many sheep were sold in the 18th and 19th centuries; later growth came from the town&#x27;s position at the intersection of two railway lines. The busy A350, which connects the M4 motorway with the south coast, passes through the town. The urban area has expanded to include the village of Westbury Leigh and the hamlets of Chalford and Frogmore.

== History ==
A Romano-British settlement was found at The Ham, in the north of the parish, in the 1870s.

The manor of Westbury, and the hundred with the same boundaries, was held by the king at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086. The Wiltshire Victoria County History recounts the fragmentation into manors, and traces their ownership. The ancient parish included Bratton, Dilton, Dilton Marsh, Heywood and part of Chapmanslade. Churches at Bratton and Dilton were dependent chapels of Westbury church.

Westbury centres on its historic marketplace – although markets ceased to be held in the middle of the 19th century – and the All Saints&#x27; Church. This was built between c. 1340 and 1380 in a transitional style between the Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic and parts survive, but the church was rebuilt in the 1430s, when a clerestory, three chapels, and most of the central tower were added; the north chapel was given by William de Westbury and his father. The west window was donated in the 19th century by Abraham Laverton.

The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway was completed from near Chippenham, via Melksham and Trowbridge, as far as Westbury in 1848. That company was bought by the Great Western Railway in 1850, who over the next few years built lines onwards to Frome (to access the Somerset coalfield), then south to Yeovil and Weymouth, as well as southeast from Westbury to Warminster and then Salisbury. Westbury station was rebuilt in 1899 since it would become more important as a junction the next year, on the opening of the Stert and Westbury line. This was a faster route from London to Weymouth, which at Westbury crossed the route between the south coast and Bristol or South Wales. From 1906 the route from London was also used by trains to Taunton and Exeter.

In 1894, Westbury parish was reduced in size when a new civil parish of Dilton Marsh was created from its western part (all the land west of the Biss), and likewise Bratton parish from its eastern part. A further reduction in the north created Heywood parish in 1896. Westbury Urban District was formed in 1899, with the same boundaries as the parish. It was abolished in 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, its area becoming part of West Wiltshire district. The district was in turn abolished in 2009 on the establishment of Wiltshire Council as a unitary authority.

Leighton House in the south of the town has been home to the Army Officer Selection Board and the Cadet Force Commissioning Board since 1949. Its planned disposal was announced in March 2016, and later that year the MoD estimated that the Selection Board would move to Sandhurst by 2024.

=== Jurassic fossils ===
A band of Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay runs under England from an outcrop on the Dorset coast and comes close to the surface around Westbury. Many marine fossils have been found in the pits dug for the cement works north-east of the town, notably the almost complete skull and lower jaw of a new species which was named &quot;Pliosaurus carpenteri&quot; after its 1994 discoverer, Simon Carpenter. This evidence of a large reptile-like ocean predator has been conserved by Bristol Museum. A smaller fossil found in 1980 was named &quot;Pliosaurus westburyensis&quot; in 1993.

=== Industries ===
In common with nearby towns in the Avon valley, Westbury was a centre of the cloth industry from the later 15th century. By the start of the 19th century, Dilton Marsh was a centre of hand-loom weaving. The Phipps family were prominent among the clothiers, becoming the largest landowners by the end of the 19th century and occupying Leighton House (Westbury) and Chalcot House (Dilton Marsh). During that century the industry declined, until only the Angel and Bitham mills continued to make fine woollen cloth, having been acquired in the 1850s by Abraham Laverton; both mills closed in 1969. There were also tanning and glove-making businesses, some of them taking over the disused cloth mills for a time in the 20th century.

Malting was another important industry from at least the 17th century. In the 1830s there were six firms active in Westbury and Westbury Leigh, but by 1960 only one remained. Iron ore was discovered just north of the town in the 1840s during construction of the railway; opencast mines were developed and furnaces built. Production declined toward the end of the century and had ceased by 1925. A chain of lakes and ponds near The Ham is evidence of the abandoned workings.

===Toponymy===
The most likely origin of the &quot;West-&quot; in Westbury is simply that the town is near the western edge of the county of Wiltshire, the bounds of which have been much the same since the Anglo-Saxon period.

The &quot;-bury&quot; part of the name is a form of &quot;borough&quot;, which has cognates in many languages, such as the German &quot;-burg&quot; and the Greek &quot;-pyrgos&quot;. It carries the idea of a hill or fortified town. In Wiltshire, &quot;-bury&quot; often indicates an Iron Age or Bronze Age fortified hill fort, and such a site is to be found immediately above the Westbury White Horse.

== Governance ==
The majority of local government functions (including schools, roads, social services, waste disposal, emergency planning, leisure services, development control, refuse collection and street cleaning) are carried out by Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. The area of Westbury parish is divided into three electoral divisions, each electing one member of Wiltshire Council.

Westbury is a civil parish with an elected town council of fifteen members: five for each of three wards with the same boundaries as the electoral divisions. The council has significant consultative roles, in addition to responsibility for certain local services. The chairman has the title of Mayor of Westbury which is a wholly ceremonial role. Around 2020, the council took over the running of the town&#x27;s play areas, toilets and flower planting from Wiltshire Council, and supplemented reduced services from Wiltshire Council with its own staff. The council also runs the Grade II listed Laverton Institute which serves as the town hall and as a venue for events and meetings.

The parliamentary constituency of Westbury dated back to the 15th century but the name was abandoned in 2010, when the town and most of the former constituency became part of the new South West Wiltshire constituency. The seat has been held by Andrew Murrison for the Conservatives since 2001.

Before the parliamentary reforms of the mid-19th century, Westbury was considered a pocket borough, at one point having as few as twenty-four electors. This status led to gifts to the town from the owners of the parliamentary borough, including the Old Town Hall in the Market Place, donated by Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes.

== Geography ==
Westbury is in the far west of Wiltshire, close to the border with Somerset. It lies under the northwestern edge of Salisbury Plain; in the past, the name Westbury-under-the-Plain was sometimes used to distinguish it from other towns of the same name. The town is southeast of the city of Bath, approximately south of the county town of Trowbridge and the same distance north of the garrison town of Warminster. Nearby villages are Bratton, Chapmanslade, Dilton Marsh, Edington, Heywood and Hawkeridge, Coulston, and Upton Scudamore; and in Somerset, Rudge and Standerwick.

The Biss Brook, which becomes the River Biss as it flows north towards Trowbridge, forms most of the western boundary of the parish.

Suburbs of Westbury include Frogmore, Bitham Park, and The Ham (north and east), Chalford, Leigh Park, and Westbury Leigh (southwest). Westbury Leigh is sometimes considered a separate village, with its own church and chapel, although it is now a contiguous part of the town. Leigh Park is a large housing estate developed from the late 1990s immediately to the north of Westbury Leigh, with a large medical centre, a community hall, and a district centre with a Tesco Express.

== Economy ==
Until the 1940s, the Westbury Hill Fair was an important annual event, mostly for the sale of sheep.

The company which became known as Blue Circle built in 1962 a rail-served cement production plant a short distance north-east of the town, partly in Heywood parish; its two rotary kilns were for a short time the largest in the country. Chalk came from a quarry around 2 km away, and clay was dug from pits near the plant. From 1977 to 1992 part of the plant&#x27;s fuel came from domestic refuse, and from 2000 tyres were burned. French company Lafarge took over Blue Circle in 2001, and cement production ended in 2009. Most of the site was demolished in 2016 but the cement silos remain in use as a distribution centre, owned since 2013 by Tarmac. From 1961 until its demolition in 2016, the plant&#x27;s chimney was the tallest unsupported structure in southwestern England.

Businesses at the Brook Lane industrial area, north-west of the railway station, include an Arla creamery which makes Anchor butter. The West Wilts trading estate, in Heywood parish just north-west of Westbury, has Welton Bibby &amp; Baron who claim to be the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of paper bags and similar goods.

==Landmarks==
Pevsner states that the best houses in Westbury are near the church. His perambulation takes in the Market Place and the streets leading off it, then proceeds south and west. He notes the 1960s central shopping parade – two yellow brick ranges facing each other – and the former Barclays Bank, 1970, purple brick in brutalist style.

Besides the Grade I listed All Saints&#x27; Church, the town has five Grade II* listed houses and one monument. Oldest among them is Ferndale House, now the Conservative Club, just east of the Market Place, which although altered dates from the early 18th century. In rendered brick, its front has two Palladian windows on each of the ground and first floor, all with small side lights.

North of the Market Place, Bank House is an early 18th century house in red brick with stone dressings; its five-bay front, with a carved stone shell hood over the central door, is passed by traffic on the A350. Leigh House at Westbury Leigh, perhaps of slightly earlier date, is a similar structure.
In a central position on the Market Place, the early 19th century former town hall is in Bath stone ashlar and has a colonnaded front at street level, behind which shops were inserted in the 1970s. The first floor windows have balustraded aprons below, and above them the triangular pediment has the Lopes arms in the tympanum.

Edgar House, off Edward Street south of the town centre, is a four-bay early 18th century remodelling of an older house, faced in stucco. The Grade II* monument is the Phipps mausoleum in the cemetery, on the Bratton road on the eastern edge of the town. Dating from around 1871 (for the burial of John Lewis Phipps), the stone monument has a basement, an octagonal chamber with four windows, and a short spire with lantern.

===White Horse===

A well-known feature of the area is the Westbury White Horse, which overlooks the town from a slope up to Salisbury Plain, in Bratton parish about east of the town. Probably first made in the 18th century, its present form dates from 1778 when it was restored. In the 1950s it was decided that the horse would be more easily maintained if it were set in concrete and painted white.

==Transport==
===Road===
The A350 road passes through the town and provides a fast route to the M4 motorway (junction 17) 21 miles to the north. A controversial Westbury Bypass was once proposed which would have reduced traffic in parts of the town but would have had a negative effect on the landscape on the east of the town. The eastern bypass scheme was eventually rejected after an Independent Planning Inquiry recommended against it in 2009.

===Rail===

The town is an important junction point on the railway network, as it lies at the point where the Reading to Taunton line, forming a link from London Paddington to Penzance, intersects the Wessex Main Line, linking Bristol and Bath Spa to Salisbury, Southampton, Portsmouth and London Waterloo. Westbury railway station is northwest of the town centre. A smaller station, Dilton Marsh, is to the southwest of the town centre between the suburbs of Dilton Marsh and Westbury Leigh; this is a request stop.

==Education==
Westbury has one secondary school, two primary schools, a junior school and an infants school. The secondary school, Matravers School, has a sixth form offering a range of subjects. It serves Westbury and the surrounding villages including Chapmanslade, Bratton, Dilton Marsh and Edington.

Westbury Leigh C of E Primary School was moved from Westbury Leigh to the neighbouring Leigh Park estate. Bitham Brook Primary School mainly serves the western part of the town. Westbury C of E Junior School serves the central part of the town and takes children from Year 3 to Year 6. It is fed by Westbury Infant School, which takes children from Reception to Year 2.

The closest further education establishment is Wiltshire College&#x27;s Trowbridge campus, 4½ miles to the north. The college offers daytime adult education lessons at the Westbury Community Project building. The University of Bath is 18 miles to the northwest.

== Religious sites ==

=== Church of England ===

All Saints&#x27; Church, now a Grade I listed building, has 14th-century origins but was altered and extended around 1437, then restored in 1847. Although it has a central position near the market-place, surrounding buildings hide it from view except for the central tower.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Old Dilton was begun in the 14th century but went out of regular use in 1900 after the population dwindled in that area, southwest of Westbury. The Grade I listed building, which remains consecrated, has been in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust since 1974.

The Church of the Holy Saviour at Westbury Leigh was built as a chapel of ease in 1877, the south aisle added in 1889 and the tower in 1890; all in honey coloured limestone, to designs of the Gothic Revival architect William White. In 2000 the nave was screened off and converted for use as a community hall.

=== Others ===
Nonconformists met in the town from 1662, and built a chapel on Warminster Road soon after 1711, which was rebuilt to suit a congregation of 500 in 1821. It became a United Reformed Church on the foundation of that organisation in 1972.

There has been a strong Baptist movement at Westbury Leigh, encouraged by the congregations at Southwick, some away towards Trowbridge. An early chapel was made from a barn in 1714, and replaced on the same site in 1797 by a chapel with accommodation for 500, built in red brick with stone trimmings. Improved and enlarged in the next century, it is described by Historic England as an &quot;impressive building&quot;. In 1810 another chapel was built nearby, at Penknap in Dilton Marsh parish, after a split in the congregation. The earlier chapel fell into disuse sometime before 2019; the Penknap building continues in use as Providence Baptist Church. Later, there was a Baptist congregation in Westbury itself, and in 1868 they rebuilt their West End chapel to seat 350, on the site of a smaller 1820s chapel.

A Methodist church and schoolroom was built in 1926 at the town end of Station Road, replacing a smaller chapel elsewhere dating from around 1809. It is used as a meeting place and events venue by local organisations.

The Catholic Church of St Bernadette of Lourdes in West End, Westbury was built in 1938. It is now served from St John the Baptist, Trowbridge.

==Sport and leisure==
Westbury Swimming Pool is one of the oldest Victorian swimming pools still in use in the country. Work started in 1887 by William Laverton, with his wife laying the foundation stone. The pool was built as a gift to the town of Westbury and opened on Thursday 24th May 1888 in celebration and commemoration of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Jubilee. 

Westbury has a Non-League football club, Westbury United, who play at the Meadow Lane ground in the Southern League (English football&#x27;s eighth tier). 

The non-league Rugby Football Club, Westbury RFC, has both male and female teams who play at the White Horse Country Park, a 247 acre estate that includes a 9 hole Golf Course, Driving Range, Bowels Club and Fishing Lakes. The Park also hosts shows and events throughout the year including the Donkey Derby, Vintage &amp; Classic Car Shows and Christmas Concert.

A cricket field at Wellhead Lane was laid out by the mill-owning Lavertons and came to be known as W. H. Laverton&#x27;s Ground. In 1890 W. G. Grace played in W. H. Laverton&#x27;s XI against a team called the Australians. Today the ground is home to Westbury &amp; District Cricket Club, and to one side is the Leighton Recreation Centre, run by Places Leisure (part of Places for People) on behalf of Wiltshire Council. providing access to Health and Fitness Suites, Grass Pitches, Squash Courts, Tennis Courts and Grass Cricket Pitches.

==Media==
Westbury is served by a fortnightly free newspaper, the &quot;White Horse News&quot;, named after the defining feature on the edge of the town. The newspaper is delivered to all homes in the town and the nearby villages of Bratton, Dilton Marsh and Edington, amongst others. Westbury is also served by the weekly &quot;Warminster Journal&quot; and &quot;Wiltshire Times&quot;.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) and Warminster Community Radio (WCR), a community based station which broadcast from Warminster.

<text>The Lafranchini brothers, originally from Switzerland, are famed today for their work in Rococo style Stucco, chiefly in the great Palladian houses of Ireland.

Paul Lafranchini (1695–1776) worked for James Gibbs in England. In 1736 he went to Ireland where he worked for the architect Richard Cassels. In 1739 he was joined in Ireland by his brother Philip (1702–1779). Together they worked on their masterpiece, the golden salon at Carton House, County Kildare, designed by Cassels. Here they created an ornamental plaster-work ceiling depicting the Courtship of the Gods.

They worked on many major projects with Cassels, including Russborough and Tyrone House, Dublin. The decorative features they created, which included rosettes, swags, flora and fauna, decorated the ceilings and walls of many of Ireland&#x27;s greatest 18th-century houses, giving these mansions the individualism which distinguishes them from other Palladian revival houses in Europe.

As of the late 1990s, &quot;excellent plasterwork&quot; of the Lafranchini brothers could still be seen at number 85 Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin, one of the oldest surviving houses on the south side of the Green.

<doc id="1176237" wikidata="Q2001927" url="?curid=1176237" title="Professional foul">
<text>In various sports, a professional foul is a deliberate act of foul play intended to bring about an advantage for the perpetrator&#x27;s team. Professional fouls are usually committed to prevent an opponent from scoring. 

Various sports contain provisions in their rules to dissuade such acts. These either try to negate the advantage gained from such an act or apply additional punishments beyond those for an equivalent foul in normal circumstances. 
== Association football == 
In association football, a professional foul involves a defender committing a foul in order to prevent the opponents from scoring, or to deny an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO). The resulting free kick or penalty may offer the attacking team a lower chance of scoring than the original playing position, and the defending player therefore has an incentive to tactically commit the foul. Offending players are cautioned or sent off in accordance with the circumstances of the foul, with the punishment dependent upon both the nature of the foul and the opportunity denied to the opposition by it.

Under Law 12, what constitutes an obvious goalscoring opportunity is left to the discretion of the referee; however, several factors are given to help referees decide. These are the distance between the offence and the goal, the likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball, the direction of the play, and the location and number of defenders.

===History===
The concept gained attention in association football after an incident in the 1980 FA Cup Final when Willie Young of Arsenal committed a deliberate foul on Paul Allen of West Ham United, when Allen had a clear run at goal. As the Laws of the Game stood, the referee (George Courtney) could only caution Young and award West Ham a free kick, which he did. This provoked a national debate on deliberate fouls that denied opponents the chance to score a goal. 

At the time, the English game was suffering a downturn in attendances and the chairmen of the Football League clubs decided to consider ways in which the game could be made more exciting. A subcommittee was appointed to produce some suggestions, chaired by Jimmy Hill and including Matt Busby and Bobby Charlton. They recommended in 1982 that any offence that denies the attacking player an obvious scoring opportunity should be deemed &quot;serious foul play&quot; by the referee and would therefore receive a red card, in order to deter offenders. However, the FA&#x27;s refereeing committee abolished the rule in July 1983. The rule was finally fixed into the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in 1990 and referees were instructed by FIFA for the 1990 World Cup to send players off for a professional foul. In 1991 the IFAB made an addition which deemed that a player who committed a handling offence that denied an obvious goal-scoring opportunity should be sent off for serious foul play.

In 2016 the Laws of the Game were amended so that a foul resulting in a penalty kick would only result in a yellow card – providing that the player was making a genuine attempt for the ball – in order to reduce the &quot;double jeopardy&quot; of both a red card and a penalty kick. Referees are still permitted to send players off for serious misconduct committed in the penalty area, such as those where no attempt to legally play the ball was made.

==American football==

In American football, the rules regarding unfair acts empower officials to enforce additional penalties so as to counteract the potential benefit a team may gain from a major or repeated foul.

In order to get a more favourable field position for a punt or to run the clock down while leading a game, it can happen that a team takes a delay of game penalty of five yards by running down the play clock on purpose. When looking for a lower field position for a punt, it is to prevent a touchback by having the punt go into the end zone.

==Basketball==

In basketball, teams may deliberately commit personal fouls for strategic reasons. As the resulting free throws must be taken by the fouled player, teams may tactically choose to foul a player with a poor free-throw percentage. This became known as &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot; after Shaquille O&#x27;Neal who was a target of such tactics. Trailing teams often also commit intentional fouls late in games in order to stop the clock and get the ball back, rather than allow the opponent to run out the clock.

In addition, there are specific rules governing obvious goal scoring opportunities called clear path fouls.

==Rugby league==

The professional foul in rugby league embodies a similar concept to other sports, a deliberate breach of the rules in order to prevent a scoring opportunity. The penalty for this offence is 10 minutes in the sin bin.

The majority of professional fouls are either holding down the tackled player after a break has been made in order to allow his teammates to reform in defence, interfering in the play when making little or no attempt to return to an onside position, or tackling or impeding the progress of a player not in possession when a try may possibly be scored. The latter situation may result in a penalty try.

==Rugby union==
Law 10.2a of the Laws of Rugby deals with intentional infringements. Referees are instructed to award a penalty kick in such instances and admonish, caution (resulting in a temporary suspension from the game), or send off the offender. A penalty try can be awarded if the referee believes the offence probably prevented a try being scored.

<text>The privacy commissioner of Canada () is a non-partisan ombudsman and officer of the Parliament of Canada. The commissioner investigates complaints regarding violations of the federal &quot;Privacy Act&quot;, which deals with personal information held by the Government of Canada or the &quot;Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Ac&quot;t (PIPEDA), which deals with personal information held in federally regulated private sector industries. The commissioner reports to Parliament. 

Philippe Dufresne has served as the ninth and current privacy commissioner of Canada since he was appointed on June 27, 2022.

The privacy commissioner has the authority to audit, publish information about personal information-handling practices in the public and private sector, conduct research into privacy issues and promote awareness and understanding of privacy issues from the public.

Since 1983, the privacy commissioner has been a seven-year Governor in Council appointment made after consultation with the leaders of every political party in the Senate and House of Commons, and after the approval of both chambers. Prior to the &quot;Privacy Act&quot; of 1983, which lays out the present role and appointment process of the office, the appointment was made by the minister of justice on the advice of the chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.

The privacy commissioner reports to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.

<doc id="1176255" wikidata="Q17079521" url="?curid=1176255" title="Drift boat">
<text>A Drift Boat is an evolution of the open-water dory, converted for use in rivers. The design is characterized by a wide, flat bottom, flared sides, a narrow, flat bow, and a pointed stern. A Rocker is used along an arc from bow to stern along the bottom of the boat. It is this constant rocker that allows the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids.

==Hull materials==
The earliest drift boats were made out of various types of wood. Later boats were made with lower maintenance materials like aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic.

In 1992 the film &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; featured a wooden drift boat running &quot;the shoots&quot;, a series of rapids (filmed in Montana ). This portrayal of using drift boats in class I -IV rapids is only one application for this unique watercraft. Today river fishing is among the major uses of these boats. Innovation has changed the design from anglers primarily sitting in the boat while fishing, to today&#x27;s application of anglers standing in a leg brace to fish.

==Rogue River dory==
The Rogue River dories are completely flat on the bottom with upward rakes under the prow and the stern unlike the McKenzie boats. The Rogue River guides needed a boat with greater carrying capacity, and the ability to hold the current. The Rogue River dory is not quite as responsive as the McKenzie River dory but is typically larger than the McKenzie dory and is used where many people and large amounts of gear need to be carried. The high prow, great carrying capacity, and ease of rowing makes it the preferred dory for commercial use. The classic Rogue River dory with a nearly full deck is a favorite among guides on the Colorado River, while on the same river, the decked McKenzie River dory has a large following among do-it-yourself river runners.

==McKenzie dories==
McKenzie dories are specialized to run rapids on rivers, and first appeared on the McKenzie River in Oregon in the mid-20th century. They have a wide flat bottom for low draft, a narrow bow that is flat, often mistaken for the transom, which instead is pointed. The reason for this is that the rower faces downstream, therefore the part of the boat which first hits the waves (approaching from behind) must be pointed or very narrow to throw the water to the side. The bow is then widened so that a small outboard motor and/or anchor bracket can be attached. Those unfamiliar with the craft would say that they are rowed backwards. McKenzie dories without a transom are called &quot;double-enders&quot;.
McKenzie River dories are mainly used by recreational boaters who wish to operate a very responsive boat. Like the Rogue River boats described above, the McKenzie River dory provides a much more responsive boating experience than that of a rubber raft. While the McKenzie River dory is a safe watercraft, operating any dory requires keeping river conditions in mind at all times.

<doc id="1176256" wikidata="Q7157603" url="?curid=1176256" title="Peacemakers">
<text>Peacemakers was an American pacifist organization founded following a conference on &quot;More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity&quot; in Chicago in July 1948. Ernest and Marion Bromley and Juanita and Wally Nelson largely organized the group. The group’s organizational structure adopted a multidivisional organizational structure with a loose hierarchy, prioritizing local committees including but not limited to the Tax Refusal and Military Draft Refusal Committee. 

== Organizational structure ==
The Peacemakers differed from other pacifist and nonviolent resistance organizations in their emphasis on small-scale, local, &quot;cell-based&quot; organizations and intentional communities. It had no national office, paid staff, or membership list. Some member groups of the Peacemakers organized funds to aid war resisters and people in the civil rights movement who had suffered reprisals.

== History ==
The development and ideological foundation of the Peacemakers can be credited to the Cold War American religious renewal and a rising discontent with American war efforts. In 1944 and 1945, Activist A.J. Muste held conferences on “the philosophy and methodology of revolutionary pacifism” alongside a successive conference in 1947 in coalition with the Consultative Peace Council at Pendle Hill. These meetings were the catalyst for the creation of the Peacemakers and garnered momentum for religious pacifism within the anti-war efforts of the 1940s. The Committee for Nonviolent Revolution was absorbed by the Peacemakers in 1948 following the Chicago conference for “more disciplined and revolutionary pacifism,” which convened over 250 individuals. Membership was restricted to those who were willing to take personal responsibility in separating themselves from the “war-making state”.
== Socio-political values ==
Peacemakers were a socialist-anarchist group whose values centered on economic and social community upliftment. According to A.J. Muste, the group marked the beginning of “an International community of Non-Violence and Good-Will.” The organization believed in resource sharing and cooperation to displace a capitalistic lifestyle. They experimented with communal living, shared property, and budgeted income. Many members came from the Committee for Nonviolent Revolution, which had been formed two years before.

The group&#x27;s members vowed to (1) refuse to serve in the armed forces in either peace or war; (2) refuse to make or transport weapons of war; (3) refuse to be conscripted or to register; (4) consider refusing to pay taxes for war purposes — a position already adopted by some; (5) spread the idea of peacemaking and to develop non-violent methods of opposing war through various forms of non-cooperation and to advocate unilateral disarmament and economic democracy.

Peacemakers were dedicated to “engaging in holy disobedience against the war-making and conscripting state.” Their primary beliefs were founded upon a modern understanding of enlightenment realism. The organization‘s political values originated from the belief that society was materialistic and autocratic. According to scholar Leilah Danielson, the organization acted on the notion that “by taking suffering upon themselves in individual and collective active disobedience, they would cut through the conformist culture of the 1950s and awaken their fellow Americans to their responsibility for the atomic and international crisis”. In the 1950s, the Peacemakers’ socio-political involvement focused on advocacy for international nuclear disarmament and the civil rights movement. The group also held close ties to the Catholic Worker Movement, the Student Christian Movement, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Gandhian philosophy of nonviolence.

== Achievements and Activism ==
Tax Refusal

During the late 1940s, the Peacemakers distributed several anti-taxation pamphlets and contributed to demonstrations towards this cause. Notably, a 1949 leaflet marked taxation as a “cancer with its roots in your purse and in your mind.” It further stated, “you pay the bills of war, you accept war jobs, you bombed Nagasaki. If you keep on doing these routine, but really immoral things, you will soon bomb hundreds of other cities.”

Military Draft Resistance

Peacemakers conducted an anti-conscription campaign in alliance with the War Resisters League and African American leader A. Philip Randolph. Segregation became a catalyst for Randolph’s creation of the Committee against Jim Crow in Military Service and Training in 1947. Well-known civil rights organizer and activist Bayard Rustin was appointed Executive Secretary for the Committee against Jim Crow. The Peacemakers continued its advocacy campaigns by working in collaboration with the NAACP and local civil rights organizations to advocate for equality.

Community Mutual Aid

In June 1949, Wally Nelson and Carson Foltz held a meeting to discuss “how may a Peacemaker earn his living, spend his money, and provide economic security for his family in a profit-centered society.” Starting with the Cincinnati, Ohio metro area, the forum focused on providing local communities with shared resources to avoid  “predatory enterprises” (banks, insurance, investments, etc.). A consensus was met to create a voluntary mutual aid funding pool to which Peacemakers and participating individuals could contribute and benefit from simultaneously. Wally and Juanita were assigned the role of creating a program in addition to the funding pool that described Peacemaker economics and disciplines.

The local branch alongside the Bromleys purchased a group farmhouse north of Cincinnati to share the responsibility of food, finances, childcare, and maintaining communal belongings. This was done to model nonviolent and collectivist living based on Marxist philosophy. At the farmhouse, the Bromleys established &quot;Gano Peacemakers, Inc.&quot;, a non-profit organization that was later seized by the IRS for their refusal to pay taxes, a method used to protest against military and war activities.

<text>The Isuzu Ascender is a mid-size SUV built by General Motors for Isuzu. The 7-passenger Ascender was introduced for the 2003 model year as a replacement for the Isuzu Trooper. The 5-passenger Ascender was introduced for the 2004 model year as a replacement for the Isuzu Rodeo and the Isuzu Axiom.

==Overview==
The Ascender is the only one of GM&#x27;s GMT360-based mid-size SUVs that was not GM-branded. The Ascender LWB was dropped after the 2006 model year. Reviews warned of a thin dealer network for warranty repairs, and the Kelley Blue Book projected a relatively low resale value similar to the TrailBlazer. However, Isuzu offered a seven-year/75,000-mile powertrain warranty as well as substantial factory incentives.

The Ascender ended production on June 6, 2008, as part of Isuzu&#x27;s withdrawal from the United States market.

Engines:
* 2003–2008 4200 4.2 L (256 in³) LL8 I6
* 2003–2004 5300 5.3 L (323 in³) LM4 V8
* 2005–2007 5300 5.3 L (323 in³) LH6 V8 with Displacement on Demand

==Recall==
In 2012, General Motors and Isuzu recalled more than 258,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada to fix short-circuits in power window and door-lock switches that could cause fires. The recall covered Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender and Saab 9-7X SUVs from the 2006 and 2007 model years. The SUVs were sold or registered in the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska, and Canada.

General Motors announced the recall of 316,357 vehicles in late 2014, primarily in North America, to fix malfunctioning headlights. According to the company, a problem in the headlamp driver module could have led to temporary or permanent malfunctioning of the low-beam headlamps and daytime running lamps. This increased the possibility of an accident.
However, the high-beam headlamps, marker lamps, turn signals and fog lamps are not affected by the issue. The vehicles that were covered under the recall are the 2006–2009 Buick LaCrosse sedans; 2006–2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and Buick Rainier SUVs; and 2006–2008 Saab 9-7X and Isuzu Ascender SUVs.

<text>Royal Air Force Finningley or more simply RAF Finningley is a former Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force station at Finningley, in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. The station straddled the historic county boundaries of both Nottinghamshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire.

The station was used as a bomber base during the Second World War, then in the early 1950s it had fighters allocated to it. From the late 1950s to the 1970s it was one of the home airfields of the V-bomber force, before becoming an RAF Support Command base and housing the headquarters of the RAF Search and Rescue Force.

RAF Finningley was decommissioned in 1996. The airfield was developed into an international airport named Doncaster Sheffield Airport, which opened on 28 April 2005. The closure of the airport was announced in September 2022 with the final passenger flight arriving on 4 November 2022.

==History==
=== Origins ===
During the refurbishment of the Royal Flying Corps station at Doncaster in 1915 a decision was taken to move operations temporarily to an air strip at Brancroft Farm south of the Finningley site.

This flight of aircraft is thought to have consisted of Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2c fighters of No. 33 Squadron RAF. These fighters were used to intercept Zeppelin bombers approaching Yorkshire cities from the East Coast, in this instance, the heavily industrialised City of Sheffield.

Brancroft Farm became a Royal Flying Corps landing ground in 1916.

=== Second World War ===

Finningley&#x27;s participation in RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s offensive may have been short but the station played a vital part in finishing crews with operational training for the bombing role. An early pre-war expansion scheme airfield the site, farmland in a well wooded locality southeast of Doncaster was acquired in the summer of 1935. The Doncaster-Lincoln railway line ran a quarter mile to the north and Finningley village lay a similar distance to the east. The flying field covered around with the camp area situated to the northwest between Mare Flats Plantation and the A1 &#x27;Great North Road&#x27; (now the A638). Five Type C hangars were erected in the usual crescent layout facing the bombing circle, with a fifth directly behind the southernmost of the line. Administration and technical site buildings were immediately to the rear of the hangars. The camp cost £430,000 () to build and came under the command of No. 3 Bomber Group, who were headquartered at RAF Andover.

The station opened officially on 30 July 1936, however, Nos. 7 and 102 RAF Squadrons did not move in until September 1936 from RAF Worthy Down with Handley Page Heyfords. During the next year, No. 7 Squadron split into No. 76 and No. 102 similarly divided to produce No. 77 the latter two soon being moved south to RAF Honington. No. 7 Squadron converted to Whitleys in March and April 1938 while No. 76 continued to operate Wellesleys, the type it had been formed to fly. By the end of that year No. 5 Group completed its acquisition of No. 3 Group stations north of the Wash and, under its control, Finningley squadrons started conversion to the Handley Page Hampden, with Avro Ansons to fill out strength until more of this new type were available from production.

The need to establish units devoted to training crews on the new bomber types resulted in the setting up of so-called pool squadrons during the summer of 1939. A revision of this arrangement brought the designated pool squadrons into operational training units and, shortly after war was declared, both the Finningley squadrons moved to RAF Upper Heyford to form one of these organisations.

Finningley was to continue in a training role for No. 106 Squadron, which brought its Hampdens from RAF Cottesmore in October. Also classed as a reserve squadron, No. 106 continued the operational training role for No. 5 Group that the previous occupants had started to provide. The squadron also brought a flight of three Fairey battles which were used for target towing at the gunnery range at Skipsea on the Yorkshire coast.

During early 1940, Fairey Battles of 98 Squadron were moved to RAF Finningley from RAF Scampton. In June of the same year, No. 12 Squadron, also flying Fairey Battles, came to Finningley to re-arm and re-coup after suffering losses in conflict with the advancing German forces over France in May 1940. The squadron moved on to RAF Binbrook in July 1940.

By August 1940 the critical war situation caused No. 106 to be placed on operational call. Most of its early sorties were to drop mines in the approaches to French Channel ports thought to be harbouring invasion barges. There was still need for a final polish for new Hampden crews and in February 1941 No. 106 left its &#x27;C&#x27; Flight at Finningley to continue with this task while the rest of the squadron moved to RAF Coningsby for full offensive operations. While flying from Finningley, six Hampdens had failed to return. In March the former No. 106 &quot;C&quot; Flight metamorphosised into No. 25 OTU, initially continuing to train with Hampdens and Ansons. A few Manchesters arrived in the spring of 1941, and the unit was later bolstered with Wellingtons.

Early in 1942 Finningley passed to No. 1 Group and with no further need for Hampdens or Manchesters No. 25 OTU concentrated on Wellingtons, nine of which were lost when the station was called upon to take part in Bomber Command operations. No. 25 OTU was disbanded in February 1943 and in March No. 18 OTU moved in from RAF Bramcote and began using RAF Bircotes and RAF Worksop as satellites. In November the Wellingtons were moved to these satellites as hard runways were to be laid at Finningley. These were put down during the winter of 1943–44, the main, 03–21 being , 07–25 and 12–30 . A concrete perimeter track had been laid in The 1942 and asphalt pan-type hardstandings constructed in 1940–41 linked to it, two of the original clusters crossing the A614 road between Finningley village and Bawtry. A single loop-type standing was added to bring the total to 36. Some additional domestic accommodation was provided to cater for a maximum 2,416 males and 435 females. The bomb store was in Finningley Big Wood.

The station re-opened for flying in May 1944 when No. 18 OTU returned from RAF Bramcote. By the end of that year requirements for operational training had reduced and in January 1945 the OTU was disbanded and the Wellingtons removed.

The Bomber Command Instructors School had been established at Finningley in December 1944 and this organisation, with a variety of bomber types, saw out the remaining months of the war at this station and did not depart until the spring of 1947. Navigational training was the main objective of No. 6 Flying Training School RAF, first using Vickers Varsity and later Hawker Siddeley Dominie aircraft. Although Finningley passed to RAF Support Command in 1977, its training role continued throughout in the next decade before RAF activity was terminated.

Sister RAF stations of RAF Finningley located in and around Doncaster included:

;RAF Bawtry
Located at Bawtry Hall in Bawtry this was No 1 Group Bomber Command Headquarters and administration unit. The airfield at RAF Bawtry was operated by RAF Bircotes. RAF Bawtry became the centre of the RAF Meteorological Service and ceased military operations in 1986.

;RAF Bircotes
A satellite from RAF Finningley operating Avro Ansons, Wellingtons, and Manchesters from No. 25 OTU. Also operating No. 1 Group RAF Bomber Command HQ Communications Flight in support of RAF Bawtry.

;RAF Doncaster
First opened in 1908 as one of the world&#x27;s first airports, it took on biplane fighters during the First World War to combat German Zeppelins and later became a transportation squadron during the Second World War. The runway has now been lost to urban development; however a museum remains.

;RAF Lindholme
RAF Lindholme was home to the Bomber Command Bombing School (BCBS), later Strike Command Bombing School and Air Navigation School, between 1952 and 1972.

;RAF Misson
An bombing range used by No 25 and No 18 OTU at RAF Finningley during the Second World War. Post-war became a Bloodhound surface-to-air missile battery location as part of 94 Squadron.

;RAF Sandtoft
An Avro Lancaster bomber dispersal airfield, taken over by the United States Air Force in 1957. Part is now a commercial airfield, the rest is under industrial use.

=== Post Second World War ===

From 1946 to 1954 a number of different training units were stationed at Finningley with a variety of aircraft types. No. 616 Squadron RAF was re-formed at Finningley on 31 July 1946 equipped with de Havilland Mosquito NF XXX night fighters which were replaced with Gloster Meteor F.3 day fighters a few months later.

On the Monday 11 August 1952, a Meteor F.4 serial number RA376, located at RAF Finningley, and was one of the aircraft used by No. 215 Advanced Flying School RAF (AFS) had just taken off from the airfield for an exercise when it crashed close to Firbeck Hall in Nottinghamshire, approximately from the runway. A number of units withdrew in 1954 (including No. 215 ATS) leaving only the Meteors of No. 616 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, manned largely by part-time personnel, but their days at Finningley were numbered for in May 1955 the squadron moved to RAF Worksop. The reason was that Finningley was about to be given a new lease of life as a V bomber station.

=== The Cold War years and after ===
During the next two years work was carried out to re-lay and extend the main runway to approximately . Unit stores for atomic weapons were also constructed to house Green Grass in Yellow Sun, Violet Club and Blue Steel weapons. The airfield became known as the home of the &#x27;V&#x27; Bomber after Avro Vulcans, Handley Page Victors and Vickers Valiants had all been stationed at the base.

Finningley re-opened in the spring of 1957, No. 101 Squadron was re-formed in October that year to operate Vulcan bombers. A year later No. 18 Squadron RAF with ECM Vickers Valiants was also established at Finningley. In 1961, No. 101 Squadron RAF took its Vulcans to RAF Waddington changing places with the Vulcan training organisation, No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit RAF.

It was two years from 101 Sqn leaving that in 1961, the Valiant having seen its day, No. 18 Squadron was disbanded.

The Vulcan OCU was based at RAF Finningley from June 1961 until December 1969.

Handley Page Victor bombers were added to the Finningley scene in later years before RAF Strike Command (the amalgamation of Bomber Command and Fighter Command on 30 April 1968) moved its units out and Training Command took over the station in May 1970.

In 1970 there was an arson attack on Number 2 Hangar by a serving RAF member. After the hangar was locked and secured at 17:00 he lit a fire under an aircraft with catastrophic results. The hangar was badly damaged, and the perpetrator charged and imprisoned.

In January 1976, the headquarters of search and rescue No. 22 Squadron were based at Finningley, with flights detached at Brawdy, Coltishall, Leconfield, Leuchars and Valley. In 1978 the HQ was awarded a new standard reflecting its 4,500 human rescues and its 93 peacetime gallantry awards since the end of the Second World War.

On 14 January 1992, a new Air Navigation School building was opened, built at a cost of £5.2m.

Arguably the most famous of the Finningley&#x27;s Avro Vulcan Bombers is XH558. On 1 July 1960 XH558 was the first Vulcan B.2 to enter RAF service and was immediately transferred to No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Finningley. XH558 was restored to flight by the Vulcan to the Sky Trust and the aircraft was displayed during airshows until the end of 2015. On 29 March 2011 XH558 returned to Doncaster airport and Finningley, and she was once again at her original home. XH558 still resides there now, she remains in operating condition but without a permit to fly. Unfortunately, the three expert companies who were supporting the Vulcan in remaining airborne – BAE Systems, Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group and Rolls-Royce, collectively known as the &#x27;technical authorities&#x27; – decided to cease their support at the end of the 2015 flying season. Without their support, under Civil Aviation Authority regulations, XH558 is prohibited from flying. Since moving to Doncaster, the Vulcan and Canberra WK163 have been removed from the hangar and have been left outside. Doncaster Council approved construction of a special built hangar for XH558 and WK163 in 2018, but the project was cancelled completely in February 2022 as not enough money had been raised to meet the £2.2 million cost.

==Facilities==
=== Aircrew training ===

During the 1970s all RAF navigators passed through the Air Navigation School (ANS) of No. 6 Flying Training School (FTS) at RAF Finningley, when the BAe Dominie T.1 s of No. 1 ANS from RAF Stradishall and the Varsities of No. 2 ANS from RAF Gaydon moved there. In 1970, a Varsity aircraft caught fire in one of Hangars and subsequently destroyed 2 other aircraft by setting them ablaze. Low level navigation training took place on the BAC Jet Provost, eventually using the T.5A variant. The Vickers Varsity was phased out in 1976 making No. 6 FTS an all-jet school. RAF Finningley also played host to multi-engine training and operational navigation training again via 6 FTS was responsible for training all the Royal Air Force multi-engine pilots using twin-turboprop Handley Page Jetstream T.1 aircraft. Later the Jet Provost T.5A aircraft were replaced on 14 August 1993 by the British Aerospace Hawk T.1 aircraft which joined on 10 September 1992 and the Short Tucano T.1 from 6 April 1992. The school operated two new wings from October 1992, these being the Basic Navigation Wing and the Advanced Navigation Wing. During April 1995, the Tucano Element moved to RAF Topcliffe.
RAF Finningley was also home to all initial airman aircrew training (Air Electronics, Engineer &amp; Loadmaster School RAF). Finningley was also home to the Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron, that flew the Scottish Aviation Bulldog at the time, as well as Chipmunk T.10s of No. 9 Air Experience Flight. In its last years as an RAF station, Finningley was home to 100 Squadron which had moved from RAF Wyton. The squadron&#x27;s main tasks were as a target facilities flight providing airborne targets for surface-based radar and missile sites, and as a provider of small and agile &#x27;aggressor&#x27; aircraft for Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) for UK-based operational aircraft.

=== RAF Search and Rescue ===

The RAF Search and Rescue Wing was first formed at RAF Finningley in 1976, when two squadrons, No. 22 Squadron and No. 202 Squadron, came together from RAF Thorney Island and RAF Leconfield. Finningley became the administrative home of the two squadrons with their bright yellow painted Westland Whirlwind HAR.10, Westland Sea King HAR.3 and Westland Wessex HAR.2 helicopters. All major engineering work was carried out by the Engineering Squadron in Hangar 1. The wing was disbanded on 1 December 1992.

=== RAF Finningley Battle of Britain Air Display ===
The first air display at Finningley was held in September 1945. For two decades RAF Finningley was home to the Battle of Britain Air Display which was the largest one-day airshow event in the country, and a similar show was held in Scotland at RAF Leuchars in Fife on the same day as that at Finningley each year. The aerobatic airshow and the display of military capabilities, such as an Avro Vulcan bomber scramble, became so well known nationally that the show attracted huge crowds and eventually became televised on national TV.

In 1977, the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Air Show was held at RAF Finningley, replacing for that year the Battle of Britain Air Show.

==Closure==
In 1994 the Ministry of Defence announced the imminent closure of RAF Finningley as part of the Front Line First defence cuts. It closed in 1996, being earmarked for a new prison; however, this plan was dropped and three years later Peel Holdings, a property and transport company, bought the land and transformed it into Doncaster Sheffield Airport.

==Units==
The following units were also here at some point:
== Badge and motto ==
The badge of RAF Finningley, awarded in 1948, showed a Yorkshire Rose on top of a sprig of oak. The rose represented Yorkshire and the oak Nottinghamshire, as the base straddled the border between the two at its southern end. The motto was &quot;Usque ad coelum fines&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Extending as far as the sky&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Finningley has made at least one momentary appearance in fiction in the BBC film &quot;Threads&quot;, before the base is destroyed by a Soviet nuclear warhead.

==Notable personnel==
*Group Captain J. A. C. Aiken, commanding officer in the 1960s
*Air Chief Marshal John Boothman, commanding officer in the early 1940s
*Group Captain Montagu Dawson, commanding officer in the 1970s
*Group Captain A. W. Heward
*Joan Hughes, an ATA pilot who delivered aircraft to Finningley during the Second World War, having a wheels locked up accident at the base in a Hawker Hurricane she was delivering from RAF Prestwick.
*Group Captain H. J. F. Hunter, commanding officer in the 1930s
*Rory Underwood, served as a pilot on 100 squadron in 1995

<text>Electroneuronography or electroneurography (ENoG) is a neurological non-invasive test used to study the facial nerve in cases of muscle weakness in one side of the face (Bell&#x27;s palsy). The technique of electroneuronography was first used by Esslen and Fisch in 1979 to describe a technique that examines the integrity and conductivity of peripheral nerves. In modern use, ENoG is used to describe study of the facial nerve, while the term nerve conduction study is employed for other nerves.

It consists of a brief electrical stimulation of the nerve in one point underneath the skin, and at the same time recording the electrical activity (compound action potentials) at another point of the nerve&#x27;s trajectory in the body. The response is displayed in a cathode-ray tube (CRT) or through the video monitor of a computer. The stimulation as well as the recording are carried out by disc electrodes taped to the skin, and the technician may use electrically conducting gel or paste to bolster the signals being input and output. Alternatively, the recording electrodes may also be used to pick up the electrical activity of a muscle innervated by that nerve. In such instances electroneuronography is closely related to electromyography.

It is performed by an audiologist, who carries out tests to compare the two sides of the face.
The stimulation electrode is located at the stylomastoid foramen and the recording electrode is located near the nasolabial fold. The ENoG test is the only objective measure of facial nerve integrity.

==Background==
In the human body there are twelve pairs of cranial nerves. Electroneuronography is typically concerned with the amount of degradation in the facial nerves, each of which consists of thousands of fibers. Motor and sensory fibers are typically found in a 2:1 ratio, and it has been proposed that only half of the motor units need to be functional for normal nerve conduction to take place. The facial nerves originate in the brainstem, cross through the auditory canal, exit the skull at the stylomastoid foramen, and terminate face in 2 main branches on each side of the face. These control muscle contractions and facial expressions.

Facial nerve paralysis can impact several aspects of a person&#x27;s life, ranging from emotional or psychological effects to the actual physical limitations themselves. People who have been affected by such conditions often have difficulty speaking, drinking, eating, and showing the simplest of facial expressions. All of these combine to limit socialization and active involvement in the public domain. The proper assessment of facial nerve integrity is, therefore, vital to the detection and treatment of such disorders. Electroneuronography is used as a basis for a physician&#x27;s course of action in managing disease. A doctor may opt for continued observation of the patient following initial testing, or they may recommend surgery to deal with the damage.

Facial nerve disorders may stem from a myriad of contributing factors: Bell&#x27;s palsy, injury resulting from surgical error, trauma to the temporal bone, otitis media, multiple sclerosis, mumps, chicken pox, and other conditions.

==Testing/Mechanism of Operation==
===Recording Techniques===
Electroneuronography tests are performed by audiologists. Typically, the system calculates the difference between compound muscle action potentials generated near the nose (nasolabial fold) in response to supramaximal electrical stimulation near the ear (stylomastoid foramen). Thus, the electrical stimulus travels along the facial nerve, allowing it to be specifically pinpointed. Increasing sensitivity and specificity of the recordings has been a constant goal, and it is believed that variability arises from the location and pressure of the electrodes, the stimulating current, and skin resistance. Esslen and Fisch placed the electrodes on the nasolabial fold, and this has become the standard, but May and Hughes experimented with electrodes placed on the nasal ala, citing better waveforms. The two positions were compared with respect to supramaximal threshold, waveform shape/amplitude, and repeatability. With regard to the supramaximal threshold, the nasal alae demonstrated a superior biphasic waveform while requiring less input stimulation to yield adequate results. In all other categories, however, there was no statistical difference between taking measurements at the nasolabial fold compared to the nasal alae.

It is common for a general feeling of discomfort to accompany the electrical stimulation of the nerve, but nearly all patients prefer to undergo the procedure in order to effect a treatment for their condition. Measurements are generally taken on the normal, unaffected side of the face first, and then on the abnormal side. Bipolar stimulation is generated at the stylomastoid foramen, while the recording electrodes are attached at the terminal ends of the nerve near the nose. A ground electrode is placed in the center of the patient&#x27;s forehead, sufficiently far from the facial nerve as to not give an output reading. A variety of stimulation locations may also be employed, to get the best possible results. Audiologists aim to get the most efficient readings possible by optimizing results with a minimal input stimulus. The amount of damage is calculated as a ratio of how much nerve conduction has been retained by the affected side compared to the healthy value. Massive amounts of clinical experience may be required to accurately interpret the data received from testing, and misreading the results may put the patient at serious risk of developing further damage or creating a problem with otherwise healthy facial nerves.

===Analyzing the Results===
Amplitude is the key component in the interpretation of electroneuronography tests. The resulting waveforms are analyzed and reported as a percentage using the following formula:

Dysfunctional Side (volts) / Healthy Side (volts) = Percentage of Response

Other forms of recording the output include using a percentage of fibers that are no longer active. This is essentially the same as subtracting the percentage of response from 100%. Either method is clinically accepted, provided the terminology is consistent and not interchanged.

Any responsive level above 10% is regarded as being able to spontaneously recover and does not typically require surgical intervention. Anything beneath the threshold usually requires active and invasive means to correct. To ensure accurate results, and consequently an appropriate course of action, readings may need to be taken every few days until fairly constant values are recorded.

==Diagnostic Uses==
===Alternative Tests===
Several alternative procedures exist for testing facial nerve integrity. Electromyography, Acoustic reflex testing (formerly the gold standard), MRI, CT scanning, transcranial magnetic stimulation, blink reflex tests, and maximal/minimal stimulation tests may also be used to assess the viability of the nerves. Currently, however, electroneuronography serves as the only objective test compared to these options, and the test is preferentially performed before the others.

===House-Brackmann Facial Grading Scale===
The House-Brackmann (HB) scale is the standard used by medical professionals to evaluate facial nerve function. It is a measure of the range of intentional motion the patient&#x27;s facial muscles have, and is based largely on the observations of the physician. Because of the subjective nature of the scale, there may be discrepancies between assessments by different doctors, but the overall reliability and ease of use has made this scale the most commonly employed by medical professionals.

The scale itself consists of six levels of facial nerve function, ranging from healthy (level 1) to a total lack of movement (level 6). When performing a visual examination, the level at which the patient&#x27;s facial nerves are functioning is reported as a fraction of the 6 levels. Therefore, someone with normal facial nerve integrity would be reported as &quot;1/6,&quot; or &quot;level 1 of 6.&quot; Grade two is associated with mild weakening of the facial nerve, and grades three and four have moderate damage, varying only on the basis of the ability to close the eye. The next two levels include severe impairment and total paralysis, respectively. Electroneuronography may only be employed in the most severe instances (5/6 or 6/6) because in the other cases there is clear evidence that the nerve is mostly intact. Even so, it may be helpful to chart a patient&#x27;s progress beginning at the lowest levels of damage.

===Common Causes of Weakness===
Perhaps the most common cause of damage to the facial nerve is Bell&#x27;s palsy (BP). It has a reported incidence of about 0.00015% within the world population each year, and in up to approximately 10% of those cases, the disorder will recur. The etiology of this disease is currently unknown, but hypotheses include infections, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and neuropathy. Among those who develop the disorder, unilateral paralysis of the facial muscles occurs in a day or two, but it is common for the patient to recover on their own over the span of a few weeks. Even if the condition is resolved, the patient still stands a 20% chance of having lifelong weakness in their facial muscles, and 5% of these people will have permanent damage equivalent to a level of 4 or higher on the House-Brackmann scale.

Another possible effect of Bell&#x27;s palsy is Wallerian degeneration (WD), which may take days to become evident. Because of the slow-acting nature of this pathology, a patient may present healthy electroneuronography results despite a lack of volitional control of the facial muscles immediately following the onset of Bell&#x27;s palsy. This is because the degeneration has not yet reached completion, and some fibers are still intact. Therefore, it is standard procedure to wait at least three days after symptoms present themselves to perform an electroneuronography test, in order to prevent false negatives. At the other end of the spectrum, tests are generally not recommended after a period of twenty-one days. Typically, electroneuronography recordings are taken on the third day of symptoms and repeated every four days until a plateau is reached.

===Facial Nerve Injury===
Seddon classified facial nerve injuries into three broad categories: neuropraxia, neurotmesis, and axonotmesis. Neuropraxia is the most common form of injury associated with Bell&#x27;s palsy, and it is characterized by paralysis without a degeneration of the peripheral nerve. Electroneuronography would yield a normal or mildly impaired response, as the nerve fibers are still whole but unresponsive to conscious control. Neurotmesis is regarded as the worst possible outcome, with electroneuronography readings equivalent to a flat line, or no response to stimulation. This represents total degradation of the facial nerve. Lastly, axonotmesis consists of damage to the inner nerve fibers while the outer covering remains whole, and also yields a flat line in response to stimulation. Because of their similar recordings, electroneuronography cannot, by itself, distinguish between the latter two forms of nerve injury.

<text>Rapallo ( , , ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Genoa, in the Italian region of Liguria.

As of 2017 it had 29,778 inhabitants. It lies on the Ligurian Sea coast, on the Tigullio Gulf, between Portofino and Chiavari, 25 kilometers east-south east of Genoa itself.

The Parco Naturale Regionale di Portofino, encompassing the territory of six Ligurian communes, includes the Rapallo area.

==History==

The first settlement dates probably from the 8th century BC, although the findings have not clarified if it was Etruscan or Greek.

The name of the city appears for the first time in a document from 964. In 1203, the Podestà of Rapallo was created, and the town became a Genoese dominion in 1229, remaining under that aegis until the Napoleonic Wars. Galleys from Rapallo took part to the Battle of Meloria of 1284. On 5 September 1494, it was captured by the Aragonese, but three days later 2,500 Swiss troops ousted them.

During the 16th century it was attacked and sacked by the Ottomans and Barbary pirates. To help defend the village against such attacks a castle was built on the seafront. In 1608 Rapallo was made into a &quot;Capitaneato&quot; (captainship) of its own, as part of the Republic of Genoa.

In the late 18th century it was captured by the French who, after several clashes against Austro-Russian troops, in 1805 annexed it to the Apennins region. In 1814, the English freed it, and the following year the city was given to the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont as part of the Duchy of Genoa.

In late 1917 the Anglo-Franco-Italian Rapallo conference met following the disastrous Italian defeat at Caporetto. It was decided to create a supreme war council at Versailles and to shift some French and British troops to the Italian front. On 12 November 1920, Italy and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia) signed the Treaty of Rapallo (1920), which resolved the frontier issues between them without reference to the other Allies. Italy acquired the strategically important crest of the Julian Alps as its boundary in the northeast. Also concluded at Rapallo was the Russian-German Treaty of Rapallo of April 1922, in which both countries renounced claims to war reparations and renewed diplomatic relations. This agreement marked the emergence of Russia and Germany from the diplomatic isolation caused by World War I (1914–18).

During World War II numerous partisans from Rapallo were shot by German occupation troops.

Rapallo has been known for its climate that made it over the years the winter residence of preference for most of the affluent Italians living in the North West of Italy. Its proximity to the coast makes for mild winters where people can enjoy easy strolls on the sunny promenade and the golfers can enjoy one of the oldest courses in Italy, opened in 1930.

==Main sights==
* The Castello sul Mare (Castle-on-the-Sea), erected in 1551 to counter the frequent pirate attacks. It includes a small chapel dedicated to St. Cajetan, built in 1688.
* The Castello di Punta Pagana is a seat of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. It was finished on 28 July 1631.

==People==
* The polymath Fortunio Liceti was born in Rapallo in 1577.
* Cornelia Wicker Armsby, an American golfer and socialite, died at Rapallo in 1969.
* Max Beerbohm, the caricaturist and essayist, lived in Rapallo from 1910 until his death in 1956, with the exception of the two World Wars.
* Domingo Ghirardelli, founder of the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company was born in Rapallo in 1817 and also died there while visiting in 1894.
* Sir Edmund Grimani Hornby, former Chief Judge of the British Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople and British Supreme Court for China and Japan died in Rapallo in 1896 and was buried there.
* The poet Ezra Pound lived in Rapallo between the years 1924 and 1945, and part-time from 1959 to 1972, and wrote much of his &quot;Cantos&quot; there. His father, Homer Pound, is buried in the non-Catholic section of Cimitero Urbano on Via Cerisola.
* Sir Charles Hercules Read, British archaeologist and curator, died in Rapallo in 1929 and is buried in the non-Catholic section of Cimitero Urbano.
* The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius stayed with his family in Rapallo in 1901, where he conceived ideas for his Symphony No. 2.
* Alexandra Zazzi, Swedish-Italian chef and television personality, was born in 1966 and grew up in Rapallo.
* The artists Wassily Kandinsky and Gabriele Münter had an extended stay in Rapallo in 1905, where Münter produced some twenty paintings.

===Honorary citizens===
Among the recipients of the honorary citizenship of Rapallo are:

==Transportation==
Rapallo railway station, opened in 1868, forms part of the Pisa–La Spezia–Genoa railway.

==International relations==

===Twin towns — sister cities===
Rapallo is twinned with:
* Iquique, Chile

==Literature==
Nobel laureate Eugenio Montale wow a poem entitled &quot;Caffe a Rapallo&quot;, publishedin his early collection Ossi di Seppia (Cuttlefish Bones).

Friedrich Nietzsche wrote &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; in Rapallo between December 1882 and February 1883.

The author, caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm lived in Rapallo from 1910 until his death in 1956, returning to Britain during World War I and World War II. 

The American war poet John Allan Wyeth lived in Rapallo during the 1920s and early &#x27;30s.

The theatre designer and artist Gordon Craig lived in Villa Raggio, next door to Beerbohm, from 1917 to 1928.

Rapallo is the setting for most of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Pronto&quot;.

The American poet Robert Lowell published the poem &quot;Sailing Home From Rapallo&quot; in his influential 1959 book &quot;Life Studies&quot;. The poem is about Lowell&#x27;s journey from Rapallo back to the United States by ship with the body of his deceased mother who died in Rapallo on vacation in 1954.

== Events ==
On the first three days of July, each year Rapallo celebrates the apparition of Our Lady of Montallegro, said to have taken place on 2 July 1557, with fireworks.

<text>Watts is a small lunar impact crater that is located at the extreme northern edge of the Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after American astronomer Chester Burleigh Watts. Just one crater diameter to the northwest is the irregular da Vinci. Farther to the south is the larger crater Taruntius.

The rim of this crater is broken in the south and the interior is flooded with lava. The terrain about the crater has also been resurfaced by past lava flows, leaving on a low rim raised about the nearly level surroundings. The southwest rim is attached to a low rim that connects with da Vinci.

This crater was previously designated Taruntius D before being named by the IAU.

<text>Roland Almon Ritchie, (June 19, 1910 – June 5, 1988) was a Canadian lawyer and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

==Early life and family==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the son of William Bruce Almon Ritchie and Lillian Stewart, Ritchie was a scion of prominent families — the Almons, Ritchies, and Stewarts were all major families in Nova Scotia. Ritchie&#x27;s great-uncle, Sir William Johnstone Ritchie, had also been on the Supreme Court, serving as a puisne justice and then as the second Chief Justice of Canada. His brother, Charles Ritchie was an important Canadian diplomat and diarist.

==Education==
Ritchie received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax, in 1930. He then received a Rhodes scholarship and read law at Pembroke College, Oxford University, receiving an additional Bachelor of Arts degree, in law, in 1932.

==Military career==
Ritchie was called to the Nova Scotia Bar in 1934, but his law practice was interrupted by World War II. He joined the Royal Canadian Artillery, and eventually served as Assistant Deputy Judge Advocate with the Third Canadian Division from 1941 to 1944.

==Legal career==
After the war he helped found the law firm, Daley, Phinney &amp; Ritchie. He was a lecturer on insurance law at Dalhousie University, and acted as counsel to the royal commission on the terms of Newfoundland&#x27;s union with Canada in 1949.

==Supreme Court of Canada==
In 1959, without any previous judicial experience, Ritchie was appointed by the Diefenbaker government to replace Ivan Rand on the Supreme Court of Canada.

Ritchie&#x27;s judgements were typically conservative, which often put him on side with Ronald Martland and Wilfred Judson. He is best known for a pair of conflicting decisions concerning the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;: &quot;R. v. Drybones&quot; and &quot;Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell&quot;. In &quot;Drybones&quot;, Ritchie wrote the majority decision for the Court, holding that a provision of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was inoperative because it conflicted with the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;. However, in &quot;Lavell&quot;, Ritchie wrote the majority decision holding that a federal statute such as the &quot;Indian Act&quot; could not be held inoperative because of the Bill of Rights.

One of his most significant dissents, co-authored with Justice Martland, was in the Patriation Reference, where they argued that as a matter of constitutional law, the federal Parliament did not have the authority to unilaterally request that the British Parliament enact the proposed patriation constitutional amendments. Although in dissent on the legal issue, Martland and Ritchie were in the majority on the second issue in the Reference, the existence of a constitutional convention which required a significant degree of provincial support for major constitutional amendments.

==Later life==
He served on the Court until his retirement in 1984. He retired due to poor health at age 74, a year before the mandatory retirement age of 75. In 1985 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. From 1974 to 1988, he was the Chancellor of the University of King&#x27;s College.

<doc id="1176300" wikidata="Q7617525" url="?curid=1176300" title="Stir-up Sunday">
<text>Stir-up Sunday is an informal term in Catholic and Anglican churches for the last Sunday before the season of Advent. It gets its name from the beginning of the collect for the day in the Book of Common Prayer, which begins with the words, &quot;Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people...&quot;, but it has become associated with the custom of making the Christmas puddings on that day. The Christmas pudding is one of the essential British Christmas traditions and is said to have been introduced to Britain by Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria (the reality is that the meatless version was introduced from Germany by George I in 1714). Most recipes for Christmas pudding require it to be cooked well in advance of Christmas and then reheated on Christmas Day, so the collect of the day served as a useful reminder.

==Family activity==
Traditionally, families gather together in the kitchen of their homes to mix and steam Christmas pudding on Stir-up Sunday. Parents teach their children how to mix ingredients for the pudding. Everyone takes a turn to stir the pudding mix, for each person involved is able to make a special wish for the year ahead. Practically, stirring the mixture is hard work, therefore as many people as possible are involved. By tradition the pudding mixture is stirred from East to West in honor of the three wise men who visited the baby Jesus.

In some households, silver coins or other charms are added to the pudding mix. It is believed that finding a coin brings good luck.

In a 2013 survey, two-thirds of British children reported that they had never experienced stirring Christmas pudding mix, reflecting consumers&#x27; preference for ready-made puddings widely available in shops.

==History and etymology==
The term &quot;stir-up Sunday&quot; comes from the opening words of the collect for the day in the &quot;1549 Book of Common Prayer&quot; and later (a translation of the Roman Missal&#x27;s collect used on the last Sunday before Advent):
In the Book of Common Prayer and later editions, this collect is listed for &quot;The Twenty-Fifth Sunday After Trinity&quot;, with a rubric specifying that this collect &quot;shall always be used upon the Sunday next before Advent&quot;. This reinforced the significance of this day as forming part of the preparation for the season of Advent. The rubric is necessary because the last Sunday before Advent does not always fall on the 25th Sunday after Trinity Sunday. Trinity Sunday is a moveable feast and the Advent season is fixed, so the number of weeks in between varies from year to year. Thus, this collect was always read just before Advent – as it in the (pre-reform) Roman Missal whence it came (where the Sunday is called the &quot;24th Sunday after Pentecost&quot;, but the Sundays left out after Epiphany are &quot;caught-up&quot; between the 23rd and the 24th, making it always the last before Advent).

Since most recipes for Christmas pudding call for the pudding to be kept for several weeks to mature, the day subsequently became connected, in countries which used the Book of Common Prayer, with the preparation of Christmas puddings in readiness for Christmas.

In recent years most provinces of the Anglican Communion have adopted the practice of the Roman Catholic Church in observing this Sunday as Christ the King (sometimes under the name &quot;The Reign of Christ&quot;). Popular attachment to the &quot;Stir up&quot; collect has, however, caused it to be retained (in contemporary language) in the liturgies of several provinces. The Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Common Worship&quot; uses it as the Post-Communion prayer, with a rubric stating that it &quot;may be used as the Collect at Morning and Evening Prayer during this week&quot;.

In the Catholic Ordinariates for former Anglicans, Divine Worship: The Missal appoints the &quot;stir up&quot; collect for use on any of the weekdays between the Solemnity of Christ the King which are not themselves Feasts or Obligatory Memorials. The collect thus functions as the collect for the Sunday Next Before Advent, even though the Sunday with that title is now a liturgical fiction, always being impeded by the higher ranking Solemnity of Christ the King. However, the fictional Sunday nonetheless provides the real collect for the following weekdays, as in other weeks in the calendar where a Sunday is occasionally impeded by a higher ranking Feast. The collect thus continues to be used the week before Advent.

In addition, one of the two choices in Divine Worship: The Missal for the collect for the Second Sunday in Advent begins with the words, &quot;Stir up our hearts, O Lord.&quot; The other collect option on the Second Sunday in Advent is the more famous &quot;Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest&quot; collect. However, another collect featuring the phrase &quot;stir up&quot; within the Advent season is the collect for Ember Friday in Advent, which in the Ordinariates occurs on the Friday in the first week of Advent, beginning &quot;Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy power.&quot;

In the Episcopal Church in the United States, the collect designated for the Third Sunday of Advent in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) commences with the invocation, &quot;stir up your power, O Lord.&quot; Consequently, within numerous Episcopal congregations, the Third Sunday of Advent, commonly known as Gaudete Sunday, is referred to as &quot;Stir-up Sunday.&quot; Marion J. Hatchett in his definitive work &quot;Commentary on the American Prayer Book,&quot; notes that in the Pre-Reformation English Sarum Rite, the collects for four of the last five Sundays preceding Christmas commenced with the words , or &#x27;stir up&#x27;. A comparable collect to the one appointed in the Book of Common Prayer 1979 is found in the recent book authorized for use in the Church of England, &quot;Common Worship,&quot; designated for the Second Sunday of Advent; however, in this version, the phrase &quot;raise up&quot; is employed instead.

<text>Downhill Battle is a non-profit organization based in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was founded by Nicholas Reville, Holmes Wilson, and Tiffiniy Cheng in August 2003.

Downhill Battle is known for its argument that the four major recording labels have an oligopoly that is bad for both musicians and music culture. It also believes that filesharing can strengthen the role of independent record labels in the music industry, and they help produce software that helps independent artists and journalists reach a wider audience. The group supports what they call &quot;participatory culture&quot; where everyone is a part of creating and sharing art and music.

Downhill Battle are also known for their projects such as Grey Tuesday, Eyes on the Screen, Banned Music, Peer-to-Peer Legal Defense Fund, and more. Downhill Battle made Spin Magazine&#x27;s Top 100 moments that rocked the world at #81 for the moment when Downhill Battle launched Grey Tuesday and the Grey Album went viral.

The Downhill Battle team also founded the Participatory Culture Foundation (PCF) and Fight for the Future, a freedom of speech and privacy advocacy organization. PCF also has a set of Participatory Politics projects, including a politics news site and a messageboard service that has been a gathering space for self-organizing.

Downhillbattle.org was down for an extended period of time but as of October 16, 2011, Downhillbattle.org had been reactivated.

<doc id="1176306" wikidata="Q1057860" url="?curid=1176306" title="New York State Police">
<text>The New York State Police (NYSP) is the state police of the U.S. state of New York; it is part of the New York State Executive Department and employs over 5,000 sworn state troopers and 711 non-sworn members. 

The New York State Police are responsible for patrolling state highways, rural communities, and providing law enforcement services across the state.

==History==
Like most U.S. states, New York did not establish a state police force until the early twentieth century. In part this reflected the pattern of settlement across a wide frontier. A number of proposals to create such a force during the early 1900s, but faced considerable opposition from trade union interests. They feared the police would be used against union organizing, as was happening in several other states.

Following the 1913 murder of Sam Howell, a construction foreman in Westchester County, and failure of the local police to arrest suspects he had named before his death, the New York State Legislature passed a bill to establish a state police force. The New York State Police was officially established on April 11, 1917.

The division&#x27;s first superintendent was George Fletcher Chandler, who was appointed by Governor Charles S. Whitman. Chandler is credited with much of the division&#x27;s early organization and development. Chandler coined the term &quot;New York State Troopers.&quot; He was an early advocate of officers carrying their weapons exposed on a belt, which was not common practice at the time.

On January 1, 1980, the Long Island State Parkway Police merged with the state police; this resulted in the official establishment of Troop L. In October 1997, the New York State Capital Police was consolidated and absorbed into the state police.

Since February 1994, the agency has accepted DNA evidence for forensic investigation and analysis. The New York State Police Forensic Investigation Center (FIC) opened in November 1996. The Crime Laboratory performs DNA analysis for state investigations and for local law enforcement. It includes a new DNA Data Bank Section that compiles DNA records from violent felons sentenced to prison in New York State. These records can be searched and compared by computer to other evidence collected in unsolved crimes.

In December 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State Park Police was to be merged with the New York State Police. The merger was expected to take about six months. Cuomo resigned in August 2021, and by January 2022, New York officials announced that the two police forces would remain separate. 

Since the establishment of the New York State Police, 140 troopers have died while on duty.

==Structure and organization==
The NYSP divides New York state geographically into eleven &quot;Troops,&quot; each comprising a specific geographic area, usually several counties. Each is supervised by a &quot;Troop Commander&quot; usually of the rank of Major. NYSP Troops cover the following counties and regions as listed:

Each Troop encompasses 2–4 &quot;Zones&quot; which are referred to simply by a Zone number. There are up to several &quot;sub-stations&quot; located within each zone.

===Ranks===
==Uniforms==
Trooper uniforms are made of grey wool, with the exception of the Gore-Tex jacket. Prior to 1958, uniforms (shirts, jackets and britches) were woven of equal parts white fiber and black fiber to symbolize the impartiality of justice. The NYSP do not wear a badge on their uniform shirts.

== Equipment ==
As of January 2018, New York State Troopers are issued the Glock 21 Gen 4 .45 ACP semiautomatic pistol as their service pistol. New York State Troopers previously used the Glock 37 .45 GAP semiautomatic pistol from 2007 to 2018. The New York State Police used the Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic pistol from 1990 to 2007, the Glock 17 replaced the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686 (NYSP issued the Model 681).

The New York State Police is one of only five state police agencies in the United States that, as of 2019, does not equip its state police vehicles with dashboard cameras. New York State Troopers starting on April 5, 2021 have started receiving body-worn cameras.

=== Aviation ===
The New York State Police has three Bell 407 single engine utility helicopters, six Bell 430 twin engine helicopters, three Bell UH-1 “HUEY 2” Single engine utility helicopters and one UH-1H “HUEY 1” Single engine utility helicopter. Their other aircraft are two Cessna 206 Stationair Single engine airplanes, one Cessna 172 Single engine airplane, one Partenavia 68 Twin engine observation airplane, one Sikorsky S-76 (used for transporting the governor), and two Beech King Air twin engine turboprop airplanes. All of these aircraft operate under the call sign “GrayRider”.

<doc id="1176312" wikidata="Q5499833" url="?curid=1176312" title="Free Fall Associates">
<text>Free Fall Associates was a video game developer of the 1980s and early 1990s founded in 1981 in Palo Alto, California by game designer Jon Freeman, game programmer Anne Westfall, and game designer Paul Reiche III. Westfall and Freeman are married. To start the new company, Freeman and Westfall left Epyx, the company Freeman co-founded in 1978. &quot;Free Fall Associates&quot; is best known for &quot;&quot; (1983), which was one of the first games from new publisher Electronic Arts.

==Origin==
Freeman, along with friend Jim Connelley, started Epyx as Automated Simulations as a vehicle to publish a game they had created together called &quot;Starfleet Orion&quot; for the Commodore PET home computer. They eventually published dozens of titles for numerous platforms, some very successful.

By 1981, however, Freeman had become frustrated with what he called &quot;office politics&quot; and decided to leave the company. His wife, Westfall, joined him, though she cites a desire to learn assembly language programming on the Atari 8-bit computers as a motivation. Reiche joined the duo as the company&#x27;s third member.

Free Falls&#x27; first game was 1982&#x27;s &quot;Tax Dodge&quot;, a maze chase for Atari 8-bit computers. According to Freeman, &quot;Mainstream adults loved the idea, and we got written up in some major business magazines, but the market wasn&#x27;t there yet&quot;.

==Association with Electronic Arts==
Soon Freeman made a contact that would prove pivotal for both Free Fall and the fledgling computer game publisher, Electronic Arts (EA). The same day he incorporated his company, Trip Hawkins contacted Freeman. Freeman was attracted by EA&#x27;s generous attitude and the welcome windfall of development cash. Soon, Free Fall signed EA&#x27;s first two development contracts.

Their first game, &quot;&quot;, was inspired by sword-and-sorcery themes and the holographic chess-like game in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Originally intended for two-players, EA requested a single-player mode. Freeman and Reiche designed the game and created the art while Westfall implemented it on an Atari 800 computer.

&quot;Archon&quot; was released in 1983 in the first batch of games from Electronic Arts. It was a hit, and EA asked for a sequel. Freeman and Westfall significantly altered the gameplay, strategies, and premise of the game, adding a new board, spells, creatures, and abilities. &quot;Archon II: Adept&quot; was released in 1984. Ports of both games were published by EA as two of the earliest games for the Amiga.

Freeman and Reiche, working with programmer Robert Leyland, developed a murder mystery game concurrently with &quot;Archon&quot;. &quot;Murder on the Zinderneuf&quot; generates a new plot each time it is played. Freeman says he was inspired by his favorite board game, &quot;Clue&quot;. It released a few weeks after &quot;Archon&quot;.

==Twilight==
Freeman and Westfall went on to develop a few more games, such as &quot;Swords of Twilight&quot; (1989) for the Amiga and &quot;Archon Ultra&quot; (1994). Sometime during this period, Reiche left for other opportunities. None of these other games did nearly as well as Free Fall&#x27;s first two seminal games.

Reiche paired up with programmer Fred Ford and the two developed the &quot;Star Control&quot; games, published by Accolade. Reiche and Ford eventually founded the video game developer Toys for Bob.

After the disappointment of their later titles, Free Fall went on to develop some online card games which were featured on Prodigy&#x27;s GameTV service. These games included &quot;Simplex&quot;, &quot;Eureka&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot;, &quot;Stop &amp; Go&quot;, &quot;Grab&quot; and &quot;Heartless&quot;.

==Free Fall Games==
By 2002, Freeman and Westfall had renamed their company Free Fall Games. Their only game to date, &quot;Triplicards&quot;, was released in or around 2002.

<doc id="1176315" wikidata="Q928865" url="?curid=1176315" title="Art therapy">
<text>Art therapy is a distinct discipline that incorporates creative methods of expression through visual art media. Art therapy, as a creative arts therapy profession, originated in the fields of art and psychotherapy and may vary in definition. Art therapy encourages creative expression through painting, drawing, or modelling. It may work by providing a person with a safe space to express their feelings and allow them to feel more in control over their life.

There are three main ways that art therapy is employed. The first one is called analytic art therapy. Analytic art therapy is based on the theories that come from analytical psychology, and in more cases, psychoanalysis. Analytic art therapy focuses on the client, the therapist, and the ideas that are transferred between both of them through art. Another way that art therapy is utilized is art psychotherapy. This approach focuses more on the psychotherapists and their analyses of their clients&#x27; artwork verbally. The last way art therapy is looked at is through the lens of art as therapy. Some art therapists practicing art as therapy believe that analyzing the client&#x27;s artwork verbally is not essential, therefore they stress the creation process of the art instead. In all approaches to art therapy, the art therapist&#x27;s client utilizes paint, paper and pen, clay, sand, fabric, or other media to understand and express their emotions.

Art therapy can be used to help people improve cognitive and sensory motor function, self-esteem, self-awareness, and emotional resilience. It may also aide in resolving conflicts and reduce distress.

Current art therapy includes a vast number of other approaches such as person-centered, cognitive, behavior, Gestalt, narrative, Adlerian, and family. The tenets of art therapy involve humanism, creativity, reconciling emotional conflicts, fostering self-awareness, and personal growth.

In the history of mental health treatment, art therapy (combining studies of psychology and art) is still a relatively new field. This type of unconventional therapy is used to cultivate self-esteem and awareness, improve cognitive and motor abilities, resolve conflicts or stress, and inspire resilience in patients. It invites sensory, kinesthetic, perceptual, and sensory symbolization to address issues that verbal psychotherapy cannot reach. Although art therapy is a relatively young therapeutic discipline, its roots lie in the use of the arts in the &#x27;moral treatment&#x27; of psychiatric patients in the late 18th century.

Art therapy as a profession began in the mid-20th century, arising independently in English-speaking and European countries. Art had been used at the time for various reasons: communication, inducing creativity in children, and in religious contexts. The early art therapists who published accounts of their work acknowledged the influence of aesthetics, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, rehabilitation, early childhood education, and art education, to varying degrees, on their practices.

The British artist Adrian Hill coined the term &quot;art therapy&quot; in 1942. Hill, recovering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium, discovered the therapeutic benefits of drawing and painting while convalescing. He wrote that the value of art therapy lay in &quot;completely engrossing the mind (as well as the fingers)…releasing the creative energy of the frequently inhibited patient&quot;, which enabled the patient to &quot;build up a strong defence against his misfortunes&quot;. He suggested artistic work to his fellow patients. That began his art therapy work, which was documented in 1945 in his book, &quot;Art Versus Illness&quot;.

The artist Edward Adamson, demobilized after World War II, joined Adrian Hill to extend Hill&#x27;s work to the British long stay mental hospitals. Adamson studied connections between one&#x27;s artistic expression and their release of emotions. One way in which Adamson practiced Art Therapy was through the depiction of patients&#x27; emotions in the art they created. In order to gain a deeper understanding of how the mind is affected by mental illness, Adamson&#x27;s Collection started as a way to create an environment where patients felt comfortable expressing themselves through art. This art would then be analyzed by mental health professionals. Other early proponents of art therapy in Britain include E. M. Lyddiatt, Michael Edwards, Diana Raphael-Halliday and Rita Simons. The British Association of Art Therapists was founded in 1964.

U.S. art therapy pioneers Margaret Naumburg and Edith Kramer began practicing at around the same time as Hill. Naumburg, an educator, asserted that &quot;art therapy is psychoanalytically oriented&quot; and that free art expression &quot;becomes a form of symbolic speech which ... leads to an increase in verbalization in the course of therapy.&quot; Edith Kramer, an artist, pointed out the importance of the creative process, psychological defenses, and artistic quality, writing that &quot;sublimation is attained when forms are created that successfully contain ... anger, anxiety, or pain.&quot; Other early proponents of art therapy in the United States include Elinor Ulman, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Ault, and Judith Rubin. The American Art Therapy Association was founded in 1969.

National professional associations of art therapy exist in many countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, Lebanon, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, and Egypt. International networking contributes to the establishment of standards for education and practice.

Diverse perspectives exist on history of art therapy, which complement those that focus on the institutionalization of art therapy as a profession in Britain and the United States.

== Definitions ==
There are various definitions of the term &quot;art therapy&quot;.

The British Association of Art Therapists defines art therapy as: &quot;a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its primary mode of expression and communication.&quot; They also add that &quot;clients who are referred to an art therapist need not have previous experience in art, the art therapist is not primarily concerned with making an aesthetic or diagnostic assessment of the client&#x27;s image.&quot;

The American Art Therapy Association defines art therapy as: &quot;an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship.&quot;

The website Psychology.org defines art therapy as: &quot;a tool therapists use to help patients interpret, express, and resolve their emotions and thoughts. Patients work with an art therapist to explore their emotions, understand conflicts or feelings that are causing them distress, and use art to help them find resolutions to those issues.&quot;

== Uses ==

As a regulated mental health profession, art therapy is employed in many clinical and other settings with diverse populations. It is increasingly recognized as a valid form of therapy. Art therapy can also be found in non-clinical settings as well, such as in art studios and creativity development workshops. Licensing for art therapists can vary from state to state with some recognizing art therapy as a separate license and some licensing under a related field such a professional counseling or mental health counseling. Art therapists must have a master&#x27;s degree that includes training in the creative process, psychological development, and group therapy, and they must complete a clinical internship. Depending on the state, province, or country, the term &quot;art therapist&quot; may be reserved for those who are professionals trained in both art and therapy and hold a master or doctoral degree in art therapy or certification in art therapy obtained after a graduate degree in a related field. Other professionals, such as Clinical mental health counseling, social workers, psychologists, and play therapists, optionally combine artmaking with basic psychotherapeutic modalities in their treatment. Therapists may better understand a client&#x27;s absorption of information after assessing elements of their artwork.

While there is still little consistent research about art therapy, preliminary surveys and studies have suggested its efficacy in relieving symptoms and improving quality of life.

=== Acute illness ===
A review of the literature has shown the influence of art therapy on patient care and found that participants in art therapy programs have less difficulty sleeping, among other benefits. Studies have found that merely observing a landscape photograph in a hospital room had reduced need for narcotic pain killers and less time in recovery at the hospital. In addition, either looking at or creating art in hospitals helped stabilize vital signs, speed up the healing process, and increase optimism in patients.

=== Cancer ===
Many studies have been conducted on the benefits of art therapy on cancer patients. Art therapy has been found useful for supporting patients during the stress of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment.

In a study involving women facing cancer-related difficulties such as fear, pain, and altered social relationships, it was found that: Another study showed those who participated in these types of activities were discharged earlier than those who did not participate. Even relatively short-term art therapy interventions may significantly patients&#x27; emotional states and symptoms.

A review of twelve studies investigated the use of art therapy in cancer patients by investigating the symptoms of emotional, social, physical, and spiritual concerns of cancer patients. They found that art therapy can improve the process of psychological readjustment to the change, loss, and uncertainty associated with surviving cancer. It was suggested that art therapy can provide a sense of &quot;meaning-making&quot; through the physical act of creating the art. When given five individual sessions of art therapy once per week, art therapy was shown to be useful for personal empowerment by helping the cancer patients understand their own boundaries in relation to the needs of other people. In turn, those who had art therapy treatment felt more connected to others and found social interaction more enjoyable than individuals who did not receive art therapy treatment. Furthermore, art therapy improved motivation levels, ability to discuss emotional and physical health, general well-being, and increased quality of life in cancer patients.

=== Dementia ===
Art therapy has been observed to have positive effects on patients with dementia, with tentative evidence supports benefits with respect to quality of life. Although art therapy helps with behavioral issues, it does not appear to reverse degenerating mental faculties. It is important that the art tools are easy to use and relatively simple to understand. Art therapy had no clear results on affecting memory or emotional well-being scales. However, Alzheimer&#x27;s Association states that art and music can enrich people&#x27;s lives and allow for self-expression. D.W. Zaidel, a researcher and therapist at VAGA, claims that engagement with art can stimulate specific areas of the brain involved in language processing and visuo-spatial perception, two cognitive functions which decline significantly in dementia patients.

===Autism===
Art therapy is increasingly recognized to help address challenges of people with autism. Art therapy may address core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders by promoting sensory regulation, supporting psychomotor development, and facilitating communication. Art therapy is also thought to promote emotional and mental growth by allowing self-expression, visual communication, and creativity. Most importantly, studies have found that painting, drawing, or music therapies may allow people with autism to communicate in a manner more comfortable for them than speech. In Egypt, the Egyptian Autism Society implemented Art Therapy as a way to grow self esteem and quality of life in children. They incorporated basket weaving, a common cultural art activity, in art therapy programs. These art therapy activities were part of studies that focused on self esteem and proved that art therapy significantly, &quot;...increased inner strength and daily living skills and reduced symptoms of emotional disorders...&quot;. Other forms of therapy that tend to help individuals with autism include play therapy and ABA therapy. In India, a study was done to show the effectiveness of art therapy by using both a controlled and experimental group on nine individuals with autism. One of the researchers, Koo, stated, &quot;The positive changes were notable in the participants&#x27; cognitive, social, and motor skills&quot;.

===Schizophrenia===
A 2005 systematic review of art therapy as supplemental treatment for schizophrenia found unclear effects. Group art therapy has been shown to improve some symptoms of schizophrenia. While studies concluded that art therapy did not improve Clinical Global Impression or Global Assessment of Functioning, they showed that the use of haptic art materials to express one&#x27;s emotions, cognitions, and perceptions in a group setting lowered depressing themes and may improve self-esteem, enforce creativity, and facilitate the integrative therapeutic process for people with schizophrenia.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder ===
Art therapy may alleviate trauma-induced emotions, such as shame and anger. It is also likely to increase trauma survivors&#x27; sense of empowerment and control by encouraging children to make choices in their artwork. Art therapy in addition to psychotherapy offered more reduction in trauma symptoms than just psychotherapy alone.

Art therapy may be an effective way to access and process traumatic memories that were encoded visually in clients. Through art therapy, individuals may be able to make more sense of their traumatic experiences and form accurate trauma narratives. Gradual exposure to these narratives may reduce trauma-induced symptoms, such as flashbacks and nightmares. Repetition of directives reduces anxiety, and visually creating narratives helps clients build coping skills and balanced nervous system responses. This has been proven effective only in long-term art therapy interventions.

=== Depression ===
&quot;Depression is considered a mood disorder characterized by distorted or inconsistent emotional states that interfere with an individual’s ability to function&quot;. Since art therapy was originated in the psychotherapy field, just like the other mental-health related issues art therapy has been a new technique used to help individuals with depression and anxiety. Art therapy is not solely just using the basic traditional mediums of art, it can range from painting, dancing, writing, knitting, etc 

Art can be a powerful tool for relieving depression symptoms because it can instill confidence, create room for expression, and foster creativity, which has been linked to decreases in anxiety, rigid behaviors, and even physical ailments, such as heart disease and cancer. Art allows individuals to process emotions they might not have known they were dealing with or help express emotions they weren&#x27;t verbally able to communicate. Creativity and creation can both be capable of lending tremendous confidence to an individual, which can lift some of the symptoms of depression.

==== In children ====
Children who have experienced trauma may benefit from group art therapy. The group format is effective in helping survivors develop relationships with others who have experienced similar situations. Group art therapy may also be beneficial in helping children with trauma regain trust and social self-esteem.

==== In veterans ====
Art therapy has an established history of being used to treat veterans, with the American Art Therapy Association documenting its use as early as 1945. As with other sources of trauma, combat veterans may benefit from art therapy to access memories and to engage with treatment. A 2016 randomized control trial found that art therapy in conjunction with cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was more beneficial than CPT alone. Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Intrepid Center of Excellence and other Veteran Association institutions use art therapy to help veterans with PTSD.

=== Bereavement ===
According to the American Art Therapy Association, art therapy is &quot;particularly effective during times of crisis, changes in circumstance, trauma, and grief.&quot; Bereavement is one challenging time where clients find it difficult to verbalize their feelings of loss and shock, and so may use creative means to express their feelings. For example, it has been used to enable children to express their feelings of loss where they may lack the maturity to verbalize their bereavement.

=== Eating disorders ===

Art therapy may help people with anorexia with associated depression and weight management. Traumatic or negative childhood experiences can result in unintentionally harmful coping mechanisms, such as eating disorders. Art therapy may provide an outlet for exploring these experiences and emotions.

Art therapy may be beneficial for clients with eating disorders because clients can create visual representations with art material of progress made, represent alterations to the body, and provide a nonthreatening method of acting out impulses. Individuals with eating disorders tend to rely heavily on defense mechanisms to feel a sense of control; it is important that clients feel a sense of authority over their art products through freedom of expression and controllable art materials.

=== Daily challenges ===
Healthy individuals without mental or physical illnesses are also treated with art therapy; these patients often have ongoing challenges such as high-intensity jobs, financial constraints, and other non-traumatic personal issues. Findings revealed that art therapy reduces levels of stress and burnout related to patients&#x27; professions.

== Methods ==
Art therapists choose materials and interventions appropriate to their clients&#x27; needs and design sessions to achieve therapeutic goals. They may use the creative process to help their clients increase insight, cope with stress, work through traumatic experiences, increase cognitive, memory and neurosensory abilities, improve interpersonal relationships and achieve greater self-fulfillment. Activities an art therapist chooses to do with clients depend on a variety of factors such as their mental state or age. Art therapists may draw upon images from resources such as the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism to incorporate historical art and symbols into their work with patients.

Art therapy can take place in a variety of different settings. Art therapists may vary the goals of art therapy and the way they provide art therapy, depending upon the institution&#x27;s or client&#x27;s needs. After an assessment of the client&#x27;s strengths and needs, art therapy may be offered in either an individual or group format, according to which is better suited to the person. Art therapist Dr. Ellen G. Horovitz wrote, &quot;My responsibilities vary from job to job. It is wholly different when one works as a consultant or in an agency as opposed to private practice. In private practice, it becomes more complex and far reaching. If you are the primary therapist, then your responsibilities can swing from the spectrum of social work to the primary care of the patient. This includes dovetailing with physicians, judges, family members, and sometimes even community members that might be important in the caretaking of the individual.&quot;

== Art-based assessments ==

Art therapists and other professionals use art-based assessments to evaluate emotional, cognitive, and developmental conditions. The first drawing assessment for psychological purposes was created in 1906 by German psychiatrist Fritz Mohr. In 1926, researcher Florence Goodenough created a drawing test to measure the intelligence in children called the Draw-A-Man test which posited the notion that a child who incorporated more detail into a drawing was more intelligent than one who did not. Goodenough and other researchers concluded the test had just as much to do with personality as it did intelligence. Several other psychiatric art assessments were created in the 1940s and are still used today.

However, many art therapists eschew diagnostic testing and some writers question the validity of therapists making interpretative assumptions. Below are some examples of popular art therapy assessments:

=== Mandala Assessment Research Instrument ===
In this assessment, a person is asked to select a card from a deck with different mandalas, a repetitive symbol originating in Buddhism, and then must choose a color from a set of colored cards. The person is then asked to draw the mandala from the card they choose with an oil pastel of the color of their choice. The artist is then asked to explain if there were any meanings, experiences, or related information related to the mandala they drew. This test is based on the beliefs of Joan Kellogg, who sees a correlation between the images, pattern and shapes in the mandalas that people draw and the personalities of the artists.

=== House–Tree–Person ===

Modeled after Goodenough&#x27;s Draw-A-Man Test, childhood psychologist John Buck created the house-tree-person test in 1946. In the assessment, the client is asked to create a drawing that includes a house, a tree and a person, after which the therapist asks several questions about each. For example, with reference to the house, Buck wrote questions such as, &quot;Is it a happy house?&quot; and &quot;What is the house made of?&quot; Regarding the tree, questions include, &quot;About how old is that tree?&quot; and &quot;Is the tree alive?&quot; Concerning the person, questions include, &quot;Is that person happy?&quot; and &quot;How does that person feel?&quot;

The house–tree–person test is a projective personality test, a type of exam in which the test taker responds to or provides ambiguous, abstract, or unstructured stimuli (often in the form of pictures or drawings). It is designed to measure aspects of a person&#x27;s personality through interpretation of drawings and responses to questions, self-perceptions and attitudes.

== Outsider art ==

The relation between the fields of art therapy and outsider art has been widely debated. The term &quot;art brut&quot; was first coined by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe &quot;art created outside the boundaries of official culture&quot;. Dubuffet used the term &quot;art brut&quot; to focus on artistic practice by insane-asylum patients. The English translation &quot;outsider art&quot; was first used by art critic Roger Cardinal in 1972. Outsider art continues to be associated with mentally ill or developmentally disabled individuals.

Both terms have been criticized because of their social and personal impact on both patients and artists. Art therapy professionals have been accused of not putting enough emphasis on the artistic value and meaning of the artist&#x27;s works, considering them only from a medical perspective. However, critics of the outsider art movement suggest that crediting an artist&#x27;s work to an impairment is reductive.

<doc id="1176319" wikidata="Q4977324" url="?curid=1176319" title="Bruce Crozier">
<text>Bruce Crozier (June 26, 1938 – June 3, 2011) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the ridings of Essex South and Essex for the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Background==
Crozier was a Certified General Accountant and member of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario. He worked for the H.J. Heinz Company for eleven years and was the Vice-President of Finance and Secretary-Treasurer for Bennie Lumber and Building Materials Ltd. He was also the National Director of the Kinsmen Club from 1975 to 1976, and was a life member of the Leamington Kinsman Club.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Leamington city council in 1985, and later served as the town&#x27;s Mayor from 1988 to 1993. He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in a by-election in on December 2, 1993 in the riding of Essex South, held after longtime Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Remo Mancini announced his resignation from the legislature. He won this election very easily, defeating his nearest opponent (Progressive Conservative candidate Joan Flood) by almost 10,000 votes, amid fewer than 20,000 cast.

Crozier was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating his nearest opponent by almost 9,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Crozier joined 29 other Liberals in the official opposition. He supported Dwight Duncan for the party leadership in 1996, and gave his support to Dalton McGuinty after Duncan was eliminated.

Crozier was re-elected in the 1999 election by over 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Essex, though again the Progressive Conservatives formed government at the provincial level.

His margin of victory was reduced in the 2003 provincial election, which the Liberals won in a landslide. He faced a strong challenge from New Democrat Pat Hayes, who supplanted the Tories for a second-place finish. He was not appointed to Cabinet, but was named as the Legislature&#x27;s Deputy Speaker on December 8, 2003. In December 2007, Crozier was made chair of the &quot;Committee of the Whole House&quot;, a senior parliamentary role responsible for maintaining order during house sessions.

Crozier announced on November 29, 2010, that he would not be a candidate in the 2011 election.

On June 4, 2011, Premier Dalton McGuinty announced that Crozier had died the previous evening of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at a hospital in Windsor, Ontario.

<text>Lawrence is a lunar impact crater that is located on a section of terrain to the east of Mare Tranquillitatis and northwest of Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after American physicist and Nobel laureate Ernest Lawrence and American astronaut Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr. To the southeast is the larger crater Taruntius. The rille designated Rima Cauchy crosses the eastern part of the Mare Tranquillitatis and reaches as far as the northern rim of Lawrence.

This crater has been flooded by lava, leaving only a shallow ring of a rim projecting above the surface. The rim has breaks in the north and southwest, with the most intact portion in the east.

This crater was previously designated Taruntius M.

<text>Starblaze Graphics was an imprint of The Donning Company, a publishing company established in 1978 to publish illustrated books in the United States. Notable Starblaze publications include Robert Asprin&#x27;s &quot;MythAdventures&quot; series, as well as two trade paperbacks collecting the series based on the first book. Donning also published a graphic version of the &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; shared world anthology series, with art by Tim Sale.

Starblaze also published compilation reprints of the comics series &quot;Elfquest&quot; by Wendy and Richard Pini and &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; by Colleen Doran. The Pinis later sued Starblaze for continuing to publish &quot;Elfquest&quot;, and attempting to re-secure the rights to the &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; series. Starblaze countersued; the dispute was settled in 1988. A dozen Starblaze authors also sued Donning/Starblaze after the company folded the Starblaze division in 1989 and sold contracts and rights to multiple book properties to Schiffer Publishing.

Starblaze ceased operation in 1989, but the initial publications of &quot;MythAdventures&quot; novels &quot;M.Y.T.H. Inc. in Action&quot; (1990) and &quot;Sweet Myth-Tery of Life&quot; (1993) carried the Starblaze imprint.

<text>Adrian Mitchell FRSL (24 October 1932 – 20 December 2008) was an English poet, novelist, and playwright. A former journalist, he became a noted figure on the British left. For almost half a century he was the foremost poet of the country&#x27;s Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament movement. His best-known poem, &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot;, was his bitterly sarcastic reaction to the televised horrors of the Vietnam War. Mitchell&#x27;s poems ranged from anarchistic anti-war satire, through love poetry, to stories and poems for children. He also wrote librettos. In 2002, he was nominated, semi-seriously, as Britain&#x27;s &quot;Shadow Poet Laureate&quot;

== Early life and education==
Adrian Mitchell was born on 24 October 1932 near Hampstead Heath, north London. His mother, Kathleen Fabian, was a Fröbel-trained nursery school teacher and his father, Jock Mitchell, a research chemist from Cupar in Fife. Adrian was educated at the Junior School of Monkton Combe School in Bath. He then went to Greenways School, at Ashton Gifford House in Wiltshire, run at the time by a friend of his mother. This, said Mitchell, was &quot;a school in Heaven, where my first play, &quot;The Animals&#x27; Brains Trust&quot;, was staged when I was nine to my great satisfaction.&quot;

His schooling was completed as a boarder at Dauntsey&#x27;s School, where he collaborated in plays with friend Gordon Snell. Mitchell did his National Service in the RAF. He commented that this &quot;confirmed (his) natural pacificism&quot;. 

He went on to study English at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was taught by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s son. Mitchell became chairman of the university&#x27;s poetry society and the literary editor of &quot;Isis&quot; magazine. 

== Career ==
On graduating, he got a job as a reporter on the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; and, later, at the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in London. He later wrote of this period:
Ever inspired by the example of his own favourite poet and precursor William Blake, about whom he wrote the acclaimed &quot;Tyger&quot; for the National Theatre, Mitchell&#x27;s often angry output swirled from anarchistic anti-war satire, through love poetry to, increasingly, stories and poems for children. He also wrote librettos. The Poetry Archive identified his creative yield as hugely prolific. He sought in his work to counteract the implications of his own assertion, that &quot;Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people.&quot; 

Mitchell gave frequent public readings, particularly for left-wing causes. Satire was his speciality. Commissioned to write a poem about Prince Charles and his special relationship (as Prince of Wales) with the people of Wales, his measured response was short and to the point: &quot;Royalty is a neurosis. Get well soon.&quot;
In &quot;Loose Leaf Poem&quot;, from &quot;Ride the Nightmare&quot;, Mitchell wrote:
:&quot;My brain socialist&quot;
:&quot;My heart anarchist&quot;
:&quot;My eyes pacifist&quot;
:&quot;My blood revolutionary&quot;

He was in the habit of stipulating in any preface to his collections: &quot;None of the work in this book is to be used in connection with any examination whatsoever.&quot; His best-known poem, &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot;, was his bitterly sarcastic reaction to the televised horrors of the Vietnam War. The poem begins:

:&quot;I was run over by the truth one day.&quot;
:&quot;Ever since the accident I’ve walked this way&quot;
:&quot;So stick my legs in plaster&quot;
:&quot;Tell me lies about Vietnam&quot;

He first read it to thousands of nuclear disarmament protesters who, having marched through central London on CND&#x27;s first new format one-day Easter March, finally crammed into Trafalgar Square on the afternoon of Easter Day 1964. As Mitchell delivered his lines from the pavement in front of the National Gallery, angry demonstrators in the square below scuffled with police. Over the years, he updated the poem to take into account recent events.

In 1972, he confronted then-prime minister Edward Heath about germ warfare and the war in Northern Ireland.

His poem &quot;Victor Jara&quot; was set to music by Arlo Guthrie and included on his 1976 album &quot;Amigo&quot;.

Mitchell was later responsible for the well-respected musical stage adaptation of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, a production commissioned and performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company that premiered in November 1998 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, and transferring to the Barbican Theatre in London.

His work for the Royal Shakespeare Company included Peter Brook&#x27;s &quot;US&quot; and the English version of Peter Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;.

Ever inspired by the example of his own favourite poet and precursor William Blake, about whom he wrote the acclaimed &quot;Tyger&quot; for the National Theatre, Mitchell&#x27;s often angry output swirled from anarchistic anti-war satire, through love poetry to, increasingly, stories and poems for children. He also wrote librettos. The Poetry Archive identified his creative yield as hugely prolific.

After his death, in 2009 Frances Lincoln Children&#x27;s Books published an adaptation of Ovid: &quot;Shapeshifters: tales from Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses&quot;, written by Mitchell and illustrated by Alan Lee.

==Other activities==
Mitchell was for some years poetry editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and was the first to publish an interview with the Beatles. 

One Remembrance Sunday he laid the Peace Pledge Union&#x27;s White Poppy wreath on the Cenotaph in Whitehall.

On one International Conscientious Objectors&#x27; Day, he read a poem at the ceremony at the Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone in Tavistock Square in London.

==Death and legacy==
Mitchell died on 20 December 2008 at the age of 76 in a North London hospital, following a suspected heart attack. For two months he had been suffering from pneumonia. Two days earlier he had completed what turned out to be his last poem, &quot;My Literary Career So Far&quot;.

==Recognition and awards==
In the late 1960s, British poets at a conference voted for Adrian Mitchell as the next poet laureate. Around 30 years later, he was nominated, semi-seriously, as Britain&#x27;s &quot;Shadow Poet Laureate&quot; by &quot;Red Pepper&quot; magazine. 

In a National Poetry Day poll in 2005, Mitchell&#x27;s poem &quot;Human Beings&quot; was voted the one most people would like to see launched into space.
===Awards===
Mitchell won several awards, including:
* 1961: Eric Gregory Award
* 1966: PEN Translation Prize
* 1971: Tokyo Festival Television Film Award
* 2005: CLPE Poetry Award (shortlist) for &quot;Daft as a Doughnut&quot;

===Appraisal and tributes===
Fellow writers could be effusive in their tributes. John Berger said: &quot;Against the present British state he opposes a kind of revolutionary populism, bawdiness, wit and the tenderness sometimes to be found between animals.&quot; Angela Carter once wrote that Mitchell was &quot;a joyous, acrid and demotic tumbling lyricist Pied Piper, determinedly singing us away from catastrophe.&quot; Ted Hughes stated: &quot;In the world of verse for children, nobody has produced more surprising verse or more genuinely inspired fun than Adrian Mitchell.&quot;

According to writer Jan Woolf, &quot;He never let up. Most calls—&#x27;Can you do this one, Adrian?&#x27;—were answered, &#x27;Sure, I&#x27;ll be there.&#x27; His reading of &#x27;Tell Me Lies&#x27; at a City Hall benefit just before the 2003 invasion of Iraq was electrifying. Of course, he couldn&#x27;t stop that war, but he performed as if he could.&quot;

&quot;Adrian&quot;, said fellow poet Michael Rosen, &quot;was a socialist and a pacifist who believed, like William Blake, that everything human was &quot;holy&quot;. That&#x27;s to say he celebrated a love of life with the same fervour that he attacked those who crushed life. He did this through his poetry, his plays, his song lyrics and his own performances. Through this huge body of work, he was able to raise the spirits of his audiences, in turn exciting, inspiring, saddening and enthusing them... He has sung, chanted, whispered and shouted his poems in every kind of place imaginable, urging us to love our lives, love our minds and bodies and to fight against tyranny, oppression and exploitation.&quot;

The critic Kenneth Tynan called him &quot;the British Mayakovsky&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; said that Mitchell&#x27;s had been a &quot;forthright voice often laced with tenderness&quot;. His poems on such topics as nuclear war, Vietnam, prisons and racism had become &quot;part of the folklore of the Left. His work was often read and sung at demonstrations and rallies&quot;.
== Personal life ==
Mitchell first married Maureen Bush, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. They adopted Boty Goodwin (1966–1995), daughter of the artist Pauline Boty, following the death of her father, literary agent Clive Goodwin, in 1978. Following Boty Goodwin&#x27;s death from a heroin overdose, Mitchell wrote the poem &quot;Especially when it snows&quot; in her memory.

He was survived by his second wife, actress Celia Hewitt, whose bookshop, Ripping Yarns, was in Highgate, and their two daughters Sasha and Beattie.

<text>Ivan Cleveland Rand (April 27, 1884 – January 2, 1969) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, academic, and justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He has been described as &quot;probably the greatest judge in Canada&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in Moncton, New Brunswick, the son of Nelson Rand and Minnie Turner, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Allison University in 1909. In 1912, he received a Bachelor of Law degree from Harvard Law School. He was called to the bar of New Brunswick in 1912. From 1912 to 1920, he practised law in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Returning to Moncton in 1920, he joined the
Canadian National Railways as counsel.

In 1924, he was named Attorney General of New Brunswick and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from February to June 1925.

== Judicial career ==
On April 22, 1943, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the recommendation of William Lyon Mackenzie King.

During his tenure, Rand delivered many leading judgments. He is perhaps best remembered for his judgment in &quot;Roncarelli v Duplessis&quot;, which has been described as &quot;iconic&quot;.

In 1946, he developed the Rand formula requiring payment of trade union dues by all employees in the bargaining unit affected by a collective agreement, whether or not the employees are members of the union. This compromise was instrumental to the cessation of violence and promotion of industrial stability, as it required the unions to &quot;work now, grieve later,&quot; and in exchange, the employers had to remit union dues by automatic check-off of the dues formula.

== Post-Supreme Court career ==
Rand retired from the Canadian Supreme Court on April 27, 1959, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

From 1959 to 1964, he was the first Dean of the law school of the University of Western Ontario. In 1966, he chaired a Royal Commission into allegations of improper stock trading against Supreme Court of Ontario justice Leo Landreville.

In 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He received honorary degrees from Mount Allison University, the University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie University, Queen&#x27;s University, the University of Toronto, the University of Western Ontario and Columbia University.

== Palestine ==
Rand was Canada&#x27;s appointee to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine following World War II. As such, Rand visited Mandatory Palestine in 1947 and became a supporter of partition supporting UNSCOP&#x27;s majority report which led to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. The plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Palestinians. He became a supporter of the state of Israel once it was created in 1948 and visited in 1959 to dedicate a forest in Jerusalem named in his honour. Rand&#x27;s meeting with William Lovell Hull, a fellow Canadian, changed Rand&#x27;s understanding of Zionism. Rand became the central and most influential swing vote on UNSCOP in favour of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the eventual creation of the State of Israel.

== Assessment ==
He has been described as &quot;probably the greatest judge in Canada&#x27;s history&quot; and &quot;perhaps the greatest exponent of the rule of law in the history of the Supreme Court of Canada&quot;.

Biographer William Kaplan describes Rand as &quot;an intolerant bigot&quot; who disliked French Canadians, Catholics, Jews and Canadians who were not of British stock. When his sister married an Acadian, Rand refused to talk to her for 30 years. Nevertheless, as a judge, Rand was a civil libertarian who struck down restrictive covenants that barred property from being sold or rented to Jews or non-whites, acknowledged the rights of Japanese Canadians who were being interned as enemy aliens during World War II, defended the rights to free speech of the Communist Party of Canada when it was banned by the Canadian government under the War Measures Act as well as the rights of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses being persecuted under Quebec&#x27;s Padlock Law. During his tenure as dean of the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s law school he was reluctant to hire a Jewish applicant claiming that a small town like London, Ontario could not abide &quot;too many Jews&quot;. He would complain regularly about people whose names ended with vowels. Kaplan explained this contradiction in describing Rand as a person with a &quot;first rate mind but a third rate temperament&quot;.

<text>Gongsun Du () (150 – 204), courtesy name Shengji, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was not able to participate in battle until Dong Zhuo seized power from Emperor Shao. Dong Zhuo, hoping to expand the empire, gave Gongsun Du the command to attack the Korean peninsula from across the sea. Gongsun Du was successful in his attack and also took control of the existing Daifang and Lelang commanderies established during the earlier period of the Han dynasty, among others.

Under another order from Dong Zhuo, and recommended by Xu Rong as Xu and Gongsun were from the same commandery, Gongsun Du took over Liaoning. This presaged the development of Gongsun Du&#x27;s power base in the northeast. Gongsun Du later sent Gongsun Mo and Zhang Pi to present-day South Korea in an attempt to gain more land. He died in 204 and was succeeded by his son, Gongsun Kang, who continued to rule northeastern China.

<text>Pendulum Instruments is a line of scientific instruments for high-resolution time and frequency measurements.

Pendulum was originally created in the 1960s as the Philips time and frequency competence center. After 30 years of existence within Philips, it was spun off from 1998 but continued to sell Philips-branded instruments for another two years before starting to sell instruments under its own brand name.

A Russian subsidiary was established in 2004, and in 2005, XL Microwave (an Oakland, CA-based manufacturer of microwave frequency counters and similar equipment) was acquired and transformed into the US branch &quot;Pendulum Instruments, Inc&quot;.

In 2008, Pendulum became part of the Orolia Group, and in 2009 its operations were combined with another Orolia company, Spectracom to form one global time &amp; frequency systems &amp; services organization operating under the Spectracom umbrella. Pendulum Instruments continues to be a leading brand of test &amp; measurement instruments and are also sold under the Fluke brand name in most parts of the world, and total sales in the specific field are second only to Agilent Technologies.

Pendulum&#x27;s range of products:
*Crystal, OCXO and rubidium-based frequency counters and timers
*Frequency references (OCXO and rubidium based, stand-alone as well as GPS disciplined) 
*Reference frequency distribution systems (coaxial and optical)
*Instruments for measuring the stability of synchronization clocks

<doc id="1176367" wikidata="Q880701" url="?curid=1176367" title="Gerald Baliles">
<text>Gerald Lee Baliles (July 8, 1940 – October 29, 2019) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from the Commonwealth of Virginia whose career spanned great social and technological changes in his native state. The 65th Governor of Virginia (from 1986 to 1990), the native of Patrick County previously served as the Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney general (1982–85), and represented Richmond and Henrico County in the Virginia House of Delegates (1972-1982). After another stint in private legal practice, with Hunton &amp; Williams (1991-2005), Baliles directed the nonpartisan Miller Center of Public Affairs associated with his alma mater, the University of Virginia (2006-2014).

==Early life and education==
Born on July 8, 1940, in rural Patrick County, near Stuart, when their parents divorced, Baliles and his brother Larry were raised by their grandparents, and an aunt and uncle raised their brother Stuart. During Virginia&#x27;s Massive Resistance (which included school closings in many counties), Baliles attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia. He then earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government from Wesleyan University in Connecticut (1963). In 1967, Baliles received a J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia.

==Career==

Following his admission to the Virginia bar, Baliles accepted an entry-level position as an assistant attorney general in the state capital, Richmond, where he gained expertise in environmental law. He received a promotion to Deputy Attorney General of Virginia during his final three years on that office&#x27;s staff (1972-1975). As the Byrd Organization crumbled, Baliles left the office and set up a private legal practice. He had become the secretary of Richmond&#x27;s Democratic committee in 1971, and ran for office on his own behalf in 1975, and become one of the delegates representing Richmond and Henrico County, Virginia, in the Virginia General Assembly (a part-time position), Re-elected as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates thru 1981 (when he successfully ran for Attorney General, as discussed below). In the legislature, Baliles served on the Corporations, Insurance and Banking, and Agriculture committees. He was also active in the American Bar Association, the Virginia Bar Association, and the Richmond Bar Association, and chaired the Virginia Model Judiciary Program from 1975 to 1977. He was also admitted to practice before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States.

===Attorney General of Virginia===

Baliles ran for statewide office as attorney general in 1981 on a ticket led by Chuck Robb, who became Virginia&#x27;s 64th Governor. His peers elected him Outstanding Attorney General. He resigned his office in order to campaign for governor, so his chief deputy, William Gray Broaddus briefly became Virginia&#x27;s Attorney General until voters elected Mary Sue Terry (who ran on the same winning ticket as Baliles), to that office.

===Governor of Virginia===

Since Virginia&#x27;s state constitution limits governors to non-consecutive single terms in office, Baliles ran to succeed Robb and won both the Democratic primary and general election. In the 1985 election Baliles led a diverse Democratic slate, with Douglas Wilder as Lieutenant Governor (the first African-American to hold that office) and Mary Sue Terry as attorney general (the first woman to hold that office). They defeated the white male Republican slate led by delegate Wyatt Durrette. Baliles won 55.2% of the gubernatorial vote.

He served as the 65th Governor of Virginia from 1986 to 1990, and became known as an advocate for transportation, education, and economic development. He also appointed the first woman, Elizabeth B. Lacy, to the Virginia Supreme Court, expanded the state prison system, and sought to strengthen the state&#x27;s environmental protections, including cleaning the Chesapeake Bay.

During his term in office, Baliles sought to reform Virginia&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. In 1986, he guided a $422 million-a-year revenue package through a special session of the General Assembly to improve Virginia&#x27;s transportation system, even daring to raise gasoline taxes and advocate toll roads. Some later called him Virginia&#x27;s &quot;transportation governor&quot; because of the premium he placed on improving transportation. Another of Baliles&#x27;s key priorities as governor was ensuring the state&#x27;s ability to participate and compete in world markets, and during his administration Virginia&#x27;s international trade grew substantially. Increasing its revenues became another signature accomplishment.

Baliles long emphasized the need for workers to continually acquire new skills and training throughout their lives and careers. His administration increased faculty salaries, making pay for the state&#x27;s higher-education teachers the highest in the South and within $400 of the national average. He began convening annual meetings of educators and education officials with the goal of building a flexible, statewide educational system that would be accessible to Virginians of all backgrounds and ages, including from the state&#x27;s rural regions outside the Washington/Richmond corridor. In 1989, he hosted the nation&#x27;s governors in Charlottesville for President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s summit. During Baliles&#x27;s administration, the state gained 300,000 jobs, and boasted the highest per-capita income in the South (the ninth highest in the nation). Despite a national recession in the final year of his term, Baliles&#x27;s popularity helped secure the narrow election of Douglas Wilder as governor in 1989.

===Post-gubernatorial career===
While some considered Baliles an attractive candidate for higher public office after his service as governor, Virginia&#x27;s United States Senate seats were held by Democrat Chuck Robb, Baliles&#x27;s predecessor as governor, and popular Republican John Warner. Baliles also chose against pursuing the Democratic nomination for President in 1992.

After his term as governor ended in 1990, Baliles returned to private law practice as a partner in the national firm Hunton &amp; Williams based in Richmond, Virginia. He specialized in aviation and international law, negotiating agreements between airlines and airports, worked on strategic alliances between carriers, and led coalitions to expand market access and protect environmental standards. He also accepted some public service assignments, including as chair of the Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (National Airline) Commission for President Bill Clinton and Congress. In the early 1990s, Baliles served as chairman of the Public Infrastructure Subcouncil of the Competitiveness Policy Council. He also sat on the boards of the Norfolk Southern Corporation and Altria Group. Baliles also served two terms as the chairman of the board of the Public Broadcasting System.

An avid fisherman, throughout most of his professional life Baliles helped preserving the Chesapeake Bay. In 1995 he published &quot;Preserving the Chesapeake Bay.&quot; In 2004 Baliles served as chair of a blue-ribbon panel to raise money for the Bay cleanup, and in 2005 the Chesapeake Bay Foundation named him conservationist of the year. He also founded the Patrick County Education Foundation and served as chairman of the Commission on the Academic Presidency and for the Task Force on the State of the Presidency in Higher Education, for the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. Baliles received eleven honorary degrees, including the Harry F. Byrd Public Service Award from the Virginia Military Institute in 2006.

Baliles became the Miller Center&#x27;s fifth director in April 2006, and before his retirement on December 31, 2014, developed the &quot;American Forum&quot; television program (which ran for 6 years). Known for his civility and bipartisanship, Baliles also oversaw the publication of more than a dozen transcript volumes of White House tapes from the John F. Kennedy Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon presidencies and fostered its oral history program, including of presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as the Edward M. Kennedy Oral History Project (released in 2015) and laid the groundwork for the Barack Obama Presidential Oral History Project. Earlier, the Miller Center in 2002 held a conference focusing on his governorship, which led to a 2003 documentary.

==Personal life==
Baliles married twice. He had two children, Laura and Jonathan, with his first wife, Jeannie Baliles. In his final years, Governor Baliles and his second wife, Robin, split their time between Charlottesville, Virginia and Patrick County. His son Jon Baliles continued the family&#x27;s political tradition, winning election to the Richmond City Council (a part-time position) in 2012, and currently is the city&#x27;s Senior Policy Advisor for Innovation.

==Death==

Baliles succumbed after a four-year battle with renal cell carcinoma and pulmonary fibrosis. He died in Charlottesville on October 29, 2019, while surrounded by his family. He was 79 years old. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced that state flags would fly at half mast until November 28, 2019, to honor Baliles&#x27; service to the Commonwealth.

==In Popular Culture==

In the 1988 NBC Miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan, filmed in the historical Shockoe Bottom section of Richmond, Baliles made a cameo appearance (&quot;Sir, I&#x27;m from Virginia, and I protest&quot;) as an advocate for Leo Frank begging for his execution for the murder of Mary Phagan being halted due to an unfair trial and prejudice.

<text>Durham County Cricket Club (rebranded as Durham Cricket in February 2019) is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Durham. Founded in 1882, Durham held minor status for over a century and was a prominent member of the Minor Counties Championship, winning the competition seven times. In 1992, the club joined the County Championship and the team was elevated to senior status as an official first-class team. Durham has been classified as an occasional List A team from 1964, then as a full List A team from 1992; and as a senior Twenty20 team since the format&#x27;s introduction in 2003.

Durham CCC competes in the Specsavers County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup and in the North Group of the NatWest t20 Blast. They won the County Championship in 2008 for the first time, retained the trophy in the 2009 season, and then won it for a third time in 2013. In one-day competition, they won the 50-over Friends Provident Trophy in 2007 and the inaugural 50-over Royal London One-Day Cup in 2014. Having been relegated from Division One of the County Championship as part of the conditions for a package of financial support from the ECB, Durham played in Division Two of the County Championship from 2017 to 2023, when they won promotion back to Division One.

The club&#x27;s limited overs kit colours are yellow and blue in the Royal London One-Day Cup, and also yellow and blue colours in the t20 Blast. Durham is currently sponsored by several companies including Emirates and Port of Tyne, as well as 188Bet as their betting partner. The team was sponsored by Northern Rock prior to the bank&#x27;s nationalisation in 2008. The club is based at the Riverside Ground in Chester-le-Street, which is one of the newest additions to the English Test match circuit, hosting its first match – the second 2003 England v Zimbabwe Test – from 5 to 7 June.

== History ==

=== Earliest cricket in Durham ===
Cricket probably did not reach Durham until the 18th century. The earliest reference is a game at Raby Castle on or soon after 5 August 1751 between the Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s XI and the Duke of Cleveland&#x27;s XI. The game was commemorated by a ballad which starts:
:::&quot;Durham City has been dull so long,&quot;
:::&quot;No bustle at all to show;&quot;
:::&quot;But now the rage of all the throng&quot;
:::&quot;Is at cricketing to go.&quot;
As it happens, there was a return game soon afterwards at Stanwick, near Richmond, and that is the earliest reference to cricket in Yorkshire.

The first recorded match of representative cricket in the county took place in 1848 at Sunderland, between an All England XII and a Bishopwearmouth 22. Despite their extra numbers the cricketers of Bishopwearmouth were comprehensively outplayed as All England&#x27;s scores of 129 and 143 dwarfed their own 56 and 59.

The first team to carry the name of &#x27;Durham County&#x27; played an MCC team in 1876 and went on to take on the touring Australians in 1878, winning by 71 runs, and again in 1880, losing by an innings and 38, with the great Fred Spofforth taking 17 wickets for 66.

=== Origin of club ===
Durham CCC was founded as an official entity on 23 May 1882, and the nascent club played its first competitive match on 12 June of that year, beating Northumberland by 4 wickets at the Ashbrooke Ground, Sunderland. 

The club established an enviable record as a minor county: becoming the first minor county to beat a first-class county in the Gillette Cup (defeating Yorkshire in round one in 1973, and then in 1985 beating Derbyshire at the same stage); winning the Minor Counties Championship a record-equalling seven times between 1901 and 1984; and putting together a record of 65 matches without defeat between 1976 and 1982 that remains unbroken.

=== Durham as a first-class county ===
====1989 - 2005====

Early in 1989, the club began the process of applying to become a first-class cricketing county and join the County Championship. First-class status was awarded on 6 December 1991, with Durham becoming the first new first-class county for 70 years. Their first season in the County Championship was the 1992 season.

For over a decade after gaining their status, Durham were not distinguished by marked success as a first-class county. In the 2004 season they finished bottom of the two-division County Championship, sixth out of ten teams in the one-day National Cricket League and fifth out of six teams in the Northern Division of the Twenty20 Cup.

However, in 2005 under the captaincy of Australian Mike Hussey Durham finished second and achieved promotion in both the County Championship and the one-day National Cricket League. 

====2006 - 2015: One Day Trophy and County Championship victories====
Hussey was prevented from returning to the Riverside in 2006 as he was contracted to the Australian international team; and with vice-captain Paul Collingwood away on English international team duty Dale Benkenstein was captain for 2006.

Durham had mixed success in the 2006 season, finishing second in the North Division of the C&amp;G Trophy. However, Durham were poor in the Twenty20 cup, finishing last in the North Division and only managing 2 victories, both against Lancashire. The Pro40 campaign started fairly well, with Durham taking 4 points from the first 4 games with a win, a loss, a tie and a no result. However, several defeats left them needing a win against the champions elect, Essex, in the final game of the season. They managed the victory, but other results did not go their way and they ended up being relegated in 8th place. The Championship season also began with success, but mediocre results in the middle of the season left Durham hanging above the relegation zone by just half a point going into the last game of the season. Durham needed more points than their rivals Yorkshire, but looked in trouble when Darren Lehmann hit a career-best 339 in the first innings. Achieving just one bowling bonus point meant that Durham needed to score 400 without losing more than 5 wickets and then draw the game.

However, one other team could also be relegated. Nottinghamshire needed just 3 points to avoid the drop at the start of the matches, but only managed 1 point as they were soundly beaten by Sussex. This meant that Durham needed only to score 400 (for maximum batting points) and force a draw. At 191–6 this looked unlikely. But a record-breaking stand of 315 between Benkenstein and Ottis Gibson made it possible. Gibson was out for 155, the highest first-class score in his career. Durham then collapsed again to 518 all out, needing work to be done in the second innings. This was provided by Garry Park, who hit a maiden first-class century (100*) as Durham played out a draw, leaving themselves and Yorkshire in the first division.
During the 2007 season the club won its first major trophy, the Friends Provident Trophy, by beating the 2005 winners Hampshire Hawks in a game which started on 18 finishing a day later due to rain. The toss between Dale Benkenstein and Shane Warne was won by the latter who sent Durham into bat. Fellow Aussie Michael Di Venuto and wicket-keeper Phil Mustard opened the batting. Mustard looked strong from ball 1 but Di Venuto was a little shaky and was dismissed by Hampshire&#x27;s West Indies international Daren Powell and caught by Michael Carberry. Ex-Scotland u-19 captain Kyle Coetzer and Shiv Chanderpaul made significant contributions (61 and 78 respectively), the latter being run-out. Captain Benkenstein made a quickfire 61 off 43 deliveries. Durham finished their innings on 312–5.

Michael Lumb and ex-captain John Crawley opened for the Hawks, the former departing for a golden duck, caught at second slip by Di Venuto. Zimbabwean Sean Ervine was next in, immediately edging to second slip in identical fashion leaving Ottis Gibson on a hat-trick. Kevin Pietersen survived that ball, but was soon back in the pavilion with 12. John Crawley managed a resilient 68 but was bowled by Paul Collingwood who was to finish with 3–33. The rain came down and play was delayed until the following day.

With the fall of Nic Pothas (47) and Dimitri Mascarenhas (12) the tail was exposed and was quickly disposed of with Hampshire finishing on 187, handing Durham a historic win. Veteran Ottis Gibson was named man of the match for his spell of 3–24 at the start of the Hampshire innings, which included wickets with his first two deliveries.

In September 2008, Durham claimed their first County Championship by winning their final match of the season at Canterbury, against Kent. Durham won the match by an innings, condemning Kent to be relegated, and moving 8 points clear of runners up, Nottinghamshire. 

Twelve months later, Durham retained their County Championship title defeating Nottinghamshire by an innings and 52 runs at a sun soaked Riverside Ground in front of 5,000 jubilant supporters.

For the 2011 season, Durham County Cricket Club wished to return to a more traditional arrangement and have insisted on a smart dress code including jackets for gentlemen at all games.

In September 2013 Durham won the County Championship for a third time after beating Nottinghamshire by 8 wickets at Chester le Street.

Durham won the 2014 One-Day Cup, defeating Warwickshire by three wickets in the final at Lord&#x27;s on 20 September 2014. 

During this period of success Durham saw a number of homegrown players go on to make an impact on the England side. Players such as Paul Collingwood (who was the first Durham CCC player to hit a Test century and double century and captained England to victory at the 2010 ICC World Twenty20), Steve Harmison, Liam Plunkett, Graham Onions, Ben Stokes (who became England Test captain in 2022) and Mark Wood formed part of successful England sides of the 21st Century, including the 2005 Ashes series, 2009 Ashes series, 2010 ICC World Twenty20, 2010–11 Ashes series and 2015 Ashes series. Other Durham players to feature for England during this time included Phil Mustard, Scott Borthwick, Keaton Jennings and Mark Stoneman.

====2016 - 2022: Financial issues and relegation====

Following a series of financial &quot;bailout&quot; payments made by the England and Wales Cricket Board to Durham during the 2016 season, the county, which had finished fourth in Division One at the end of the season, were relegated to Division Two in place of the eighth place team, Hampshire. Durham were also placed under a salary cap administered by the ECB until 2020 and started the 2017 Championship season with a deduction of 48 points. The club&#x27;s eligibility to bid to stage Test cricket at the Riverside Ground was also removed although club will still be eligible to bid to host one-day and Twenty20 international matches.

The decision led to a number of first team players leaving the club, including Borthwick and Stoneman (to Surrey) and Jennings (to Lancashire). However, some players who left following the relegation would later return as the club rebuilt, including Borthwick, Ben Raine and Paul Coughlin

Ben Stokes and Mark Wood were part of the England team which won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, with Stokes playing a starring role in the final in which he was named man of the match. The Riverside Ground hosted 3 games of the tournament. 

Durham reached the final of the 2021 One-Day Cup but lost by 58 runs in the final to Glamorgan.

Stokes and Wood were also part of the England squad which won the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup. Other Durham players to earn England call ups in these years included Alex Lees, Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse.

On 28 April 2022, Stokes was named as England&#x27;s new Test captain, replacing Joe Root. 

On 6 May 2022, in Stokes&#x27; first match since becoming England&#x27;s captain, he hit 17 sixes against Worcestershire, setting a new record for sixes hit in a single innings of a match in the County Championship. Stokes scored 161 runs from 88 balls, which included the fastest century in first-class cricket by a Durham player.

====2023 - present: Return to Division One====

In December 2022, former Australia cricketer and Netherlands cricket team coach Ryan Campbell was appointed head coach of Durham on a three-year contract to the end of the 2025 season, succeeding James Franklin. Under Campbell Durham won the 2023 Division Two title to secure a return to Division One for the first time since the 2016 relegation.

== Ground history ==

The club&#x27;s acceptance into first-class cricket was made conditional on the building of a new Test match-standard cricket ground. Work began on the new ground at the Riverside, a spectacular location overlooked by Lumley Castle, in 1990, and the ground hosted its first game, Durham v Warwickshire, on 18 May 1995.

Development of the Riverside Ground has continued until the present day, and in 2003 the Riverside Ground was raised to Test match status. The ground has been used for six England Test matches, against Zimbabwe in 2003, Bangladesh in 2005, two against West Indies in June 2007 and May 2009, an Ashes Test Match against Australia in 2013, and against Sri Lanka in 2016. England have won all six of these tests.

As part of the conditions of a package of financial support announced in October 2016, the ECB imposed a number of sanctions on Durham County Cricket Club, including removal of the club&#x27;s eligibility to bid to stage Test cricket at the Riverside Ground. The club will still be eligible to bid to host one-day and Twenty20 international matches.

The Riverside hosted 3 games of the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

This following table gives details of every venue at which Durham have hosted a first-class or List A cricket match:
* Located in Newcastle upon Tyne, historically part of Northumberland.

== Players ==
Since Durham&#x27;s induction as a first-class county, each player has been allocated a unique squad number. The first 11 numbers were allocated in batting order from the club&#x27;s first game, and subsequent numbers have been allocated in order of appearance.

<text>Santa Ana is a small city and municipal seat of Santa Ana Municipality in the Mexican state of Sonora. It is located north of the state capital Hermosillo and south of Nogales on the United States border. The town had a 2005 census population of 10,593 inhabitants. 
==History==
This settlement originated when the Pimas (indigenous people in northwest Mexico) settled in the area now called Santa Ana Viejo attracted by the mission established by the Jesuits. The town was well-established by 1751.

The present town of Santa Ana was founded by Diego A. Moreno in the year 1883, when the Sonoran Railroad was being built in this area of the state. Santa Ana achieved the status of a municipality in 1935. The movie The Fast and The Furious was filmed throughout the months of June and July, 2008, in Santa Ana as well as Magdalena de Kino, Sonora.

The main tourist attraction in Santa Ana is the church built in the 1900s to honor Our Lady of Saint Ana. Every year during the month of July, the whole town celebrates the day of their Saint with a fair and dances.

==Economy==
Agriculture is an important economic activity with the main crops being wheat, corn, vegetables, and grasses for cattle fodder. 
Another important economic activity is cattle raising with over 20,000 head counted in the 2000 census. Calves are exported to the United States of America. 

The industrial sector is small but one maquiladora plant alone employs around 800 workers.

Similar to the US-licensed comic book magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, it allowed explicit content to be featured, unlike the traditional American comic books of that time bound by the restrictive Comics Code Authority, as well as offering its writers and artists ownership rights and royalties in place of the industry-standard work for hire contracts. The series lasted 34 issues from Spring 1980 to February 1986.

A color comic-book imprint, Epic Comics, was spun off in 1982.

==Publication history==
The magazine was initiated under editor Rick Marschall in 1979 under the title &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and originally set to launch as an issue of &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot;. After Marschall learned of at least seven other magazines titled &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the project was renamed &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; and launched as a standalone series. Marschall was replaced by editor Archie Goodwin in September 1979, several months before the first issue was published.

==Stories, series and format==
The anthology featured heroic fiction and genre stories, primarily fantasy and science fiction, in a broad range of styles. Established mainstream-comics talents such as John Buscema, Jim Starlin, John Byrne, and Terry Austin were featured, as well as such independent-press creators as Wendy Pini and The Studio&#x27;s Jeffrey Jones, Michael Kaluta, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. Goodwin commissioned stories by many new artists, including Stephen R. Bissette, Pepe Moreno, Jon J Muth, Rick Veitch and Kent Williams. The full-color magazine format allowed for a broader range of color than the traditional three-color printing process, and many of the stories, and all the covers, were painted. Fantasy artists who did not normally work in the comics field, such as Richard Corben, Frank Frazetta, The Brothers Hildebrandt, and Boris Vallejo contributed covers. The contributors to the series retained ownership of their material and were paid royalties.
&quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; also included an occasional Marvel Comics protagonist, such as the first issue&#x27;s Silver Surfer story by Stan Lee and John Buscema. Each issue usually featured a main story, a number of regular serials, and anthological shorts.

Writer-penciler John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced &quot;The Last Galactus Story&quot; as a serial in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #26-34 (Oct. 1984 - Feb. 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight, which ran 12.

==Cancellation==
Due to its expensive nature to the company and low sales, the magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter of &quot;Galactus&quot; unpublished and the story unfinished. Byrne later revealed on his website that the conclusion would have seen a dying Galactus releasing his power, causing a new big bang and transforming his herald Nova into the Galactus of the next universe.

<doc id="1176384" wikidata="Q6408512" url="?curid=1176384" title="Kim Craitor">
<text>Kim Craitor (born September 22, 1946) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He is a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the constituency of Niagara Falls for the Ontario Liberal Party from 2003 to 2013.

==Background==
Craitor grew up in the foster care system as a child before being adopted. This is evidenced in Hansard where on March 24, 2008, he is quoted as saying &quot;One personal story-and I think I should share mine. You know, politics is a funny world. People sometimes think we do everything because it&#x27;s politically what we do. I never knew my parents. I was raised through the children&#x27;s aid society. Somehow, while I was going through that system, these two elderly people, for whatever reason, took me in, kept me and raised me.&quot;

Craitor worked in human resource development before entering politics. He was executive director of the Niagara Falls Employment Help Centre, and was a human relations officer and investigation and control officer at Human Resources Development Canada for 26 years.

==Alderman==
Craitor was elected as an alderman to the Niagara Falls City Council in 1990, and served in that capacity until 2003, often quarrelling with Mayor Wayne Thomson. He also served for ten years on the Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce.

==Provincial politics==
Prior to the 2003 provincial election, Craitor defeated former party candidate Selena Volpatti for the Liberal nomination in Niagara Falls. He was successful in the general election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Bart Maves by about 3,500 votes.

Craitor served as Government Whip from 2003 to 2007.

In March 2006, Craitor was named parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Service and has also served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. He was the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Tourism and Culture (Tourism) from 2010 to February 2013 and then returned to his previous position as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services from February 2013 until his retirement from provincial politics.

As a member of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, Craitor has advocated for a transparent and open government policy for public bodies, the right of grandparents to have reasonable access to their grandchildren and right of the public to access to shoreline beaches along the Great Lakes coastline. As an MPP, Craitor earned a reputation as a , sparring with his own government on issues such as hospital closures in his riding.

Craitor was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election and was elected to a third term as member for Niagara Falls in the 2011 Ontario provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate George Lepp by 551 votes.

On September 24, 2013, Craitor announced his resignation as MPP citing mental exhaustion and saying he wanted to focus on his health and family. During the subsequent by-election campaign, Craitor declined to endorse any of the candidates to succeed him, saying that Liberal Joyce Morocco, Progressive Conservative Bart Maves, New Democrat Wayne Gates and Green candidate Clarke Bitter are all his friends. &quot;Wayne is a good friend of mine. He supported me in his own way [when Craitor first ran for MPP in 2003]. I never forgot that... Joyce is a real friend of mine. I get along with Bart and Clarke helped me [during past campaigns]... I&#x27;m going to keep my friends.&quot; In 2016 it was revealed that Craitor resigned from the provincial legislature after allegations of sexual harassment were made against him. Premier Kathleen Wynne asked him to resign after reviewing an independent, third-party report about the incident. After the circumstances of his resignation were reported on, Craitor said the allegations were &quot;unfounded and unsubstantiated&quot; and that was forced to resign by the Liberal party.

==Return to municipal politics==

Craitor was elected to Niagara Falls City Council in the 2014 municipal election.

Craitor was approached by the New Democratic Party to run in the federal riding of Niagara Falls in the 2015 federal election, but opted to remain at city council.

<doc id="1176394" wikidata="Q5289834" url="?curid=1176394" title="Domain wall">
<text>A domain wall is a type of topological soliton that occurs whenever a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken. Domain walls are also sometimes called kinks in analogy with closely related kink solution of the sine-Gordon model or models with polynomial potentials. Unstable domain walls can also appear if spontaneously broken discrete symmetry is approximate and there is a false vacuum.

A domain (hyper volume) is extended in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. A domain wall is the boundary between two neighboring domains. Thus a domain wall is extended in two spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

Important examples are:
*Domain wall (magnetism), an interface separating magnetic domains
*Domain wall (optics), for domain walls in optics
*Domain wall (string theory), a theoretical 2-dimensional singularity
Besides these important cases similar solitons appear in wide spectrum of the models. Here are other examples:
*Early in the universe, spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries produced domain walls. The resulting network of domain walls influenced the late stages of cosmological inflation and the cosmic microwave background radiation. Observations constrain the existence of stable domain walls. Models beyond the Standard Model can account for those constraints. Unstable cosmic domain walls may decay and produce observable radiation.
*There exist a class of the braneworld models where the brane is assumed to be a domain wall formed by interacting extra-dimensional fields. The matter is localized due to the interaction with this configuration and can leave it at sufficiently high energies. The jargon term for this domain wall is &quot;thick brane&quot; in contrast to the &quot;thin brane&quot; of the models where it is described as delta-potential or simply as some ideal surface with matter fields on it.

<text>The Laundry and Dry Cleaning International Union is an AFL–CIO union in the United States. Based in Oakland, California, it was created as an alternative to the Laundry Workers International Union, which had been expelled from the AFL–CIO in 1958 for corruption. Russell Crowell was president of the new union from 1962 to 1983.

The organization merged with the Service Employees International Union in 1999, at which time it had 11,000 members.

<text>Worster-Drought syndrome is a form of congenital suprabulbar paresis that occurs in some children with cerebral palsy. It is caused by inadequate development of the corticobulbar tracts and causes problems with the mouth and tongue including impaired swallowing. A similar syndrome in adults is called anterior opercular syndrome.

A 1986 study of a family in which multiple members had Worster-Drought syndrome suggested it might be hereditary.

A 2000 review of cases classified Worster-Drought Syndrome as a form of cerebral palsy, caused by early damage to the brain, but identified no obvious causes during gestation or birth and found some families with a history of the condition. The syndrome was named after Cecil Charles Worster-Drought, the doctor who described it in 1956.

<text>The Novator KS-172 was a Russian air-to-air missile project designed as an &quot;AWACS killer&quot; at ranges up to 400 km. The missile had various names during its history, including K-100, Izdeliye 172 (&#x27;project 172&#x27;), AAM-L (RVV-L), KS–172, KS-1, 172S-1 and R-172. The airframe appears to have been derived from the 9K37 Buk surface-to-air missile (SAM) but development stalled in the mid-1990s for lack of funds. It appeared to have restarted in 2004 after a deal with India, who wants to produce the missile in India for their Su-30MKI fighters. Development has ceased and the project is closed.

==Development==
Modern air forces have become dependent on airborne radars typically carried by converted airliners and transport aircraft such as the E-3 Sentry and A-50 &#x27;Mainstay&#x27;. They also depend on similar aircraft for inflight refuelling (e.g. Vickers VC10), maritime patrol (e.g. CP-140 Aurora), reconnaissance and electronic warfare (e.g. Tu-16 &#x27;Badger&#x27; E &amp; J) and C4ISTAR (e.g. VC-25 &quot;Air Force One&quot;). The loss of just one of these aircraft can have a significant effect on fighting capability, and they are usually heavily defended by fighter escorts. A long-range air-to-air missile offers the prospect of bringing down the target without having to fight a way through the fighter screen. Given the potential importance of &quot;blinding&quot; Western AWACS, Russia has devoted considerable resources to this area. The R-37 (missile) (AA-13 &#x27;Arrow&#x27;) is an evolution of their R-33 (AA-9 &#x27;Amos&#x27;) with a range of up to , and there have been persistent rumours – if little hard evidence – of an air-to-air missile with a range of based on Zvezda&#x27;s Kh-31 anti-radar/anti-shipping missile or its Chinese derivative, the YJ-91.

NPO Novator started work in 1991 on a very long-range air-to-air missile with the Russian project designation &quot;Izdeliye 172&quot;. Initially called the AAM-L (RVV-L), it made its first public appearance at the International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi in early 1993, followed by the Moscow Air Show later that year. It was described as having a range of ; the mockup on display had a strong resemblance to the 9K37M1 Buk-M (SA-11 &#x27;Gadfly&#x27;). Apparently some flight-testing was done on a Su-27, but it appears that the Russians withdrew funding for the project soon afterwards.

The missile resurfaced as the KS–172 in 1999, as part of a new export-led strategy whereby foreign investment in a -range export model would ultimately fund a version for the Russian airforce. Again it appears that there were no takers.

In late 2003, the missile was offered again on the export market as the 172S-1. In March 2004, India was reported to have invested in the project and to be &quot;negotiating a partnership&quot; to develop the &quot;R-172&quot;. In May 2005 the Indians were said to have finalised &quot;an arrangement to fund final development and licence produce the weapon&quot; in a joint venture similar to that which produced the successful BrahMos cruise missile. Since then the missile has had a higher profile, appearing at the 2005 Moscow Air Show on a Su-30 as the K-172, and a modified version being shown at the 2007 Moscow Air Show designated as the K-100-1. This name first appeared in a Sukhoi document in 2006, and sources such as Jane&#x27;s now refer to the missile as the K-100. Nowadays the missile is not in commission whether in Russia nor in India. Supposedly the development was stopped and the project closed by 2010.

==Design==

The mockup shown in 1993 had a strong resemblance to the Buk airframe, but since the Indians became involved there have been some changes. An Indian magazine gave the specifications of the KS–172 in April 2004 as a core 6.01 m long and 40 cm in diameter with a wingspan of 61 cm, with a booster of 1.4 m, and 748 kg total weight. It had a solid fuel tandem rocket booster capable of speeds up to , 12g manoeuvring, and an adaptive HE fragmentation warhead. Development would concentrate on the seeker head, autopilot, resistance to jamming and a steering system with 3D thrust vector control (TVC).

In May 2005 it was reported that there were two versions, with and without a rocket booster, with ranges of 400 km and 300 km respectively. At the MAKS (air show) in August 2005, a range of 300 km was quoted for a streamlined missile with a small booster and fins on both booster and fuselage. However the model shown at the 2007 MAKS airshow under the name K-100 was closer to the original 1993 mockup in the photo above, with different-shaped fins that were further up the fuselage, and an even larger booster with TVC vents. At the same show it was shown under the wing of a Su-35BM, implying that at least two could be carried by Flanker-class aircraft rather than just one on the centreline.

Guidance is by inertial navigation until the missile is close enough to the target to use active radar for terminal homing. The K-100 has an enlarged () derivative of the Agat 9B-1103M seeker used in the R-27 (air-to-air missile) (AA-10 &#x27;Alamo&#x27;). It has a lock-on range of , described by an Agat designer as &quot;one fifth or less of the overall range&quot;.

==Variants==
*KS-172

:Prototype in 1993.
*KS-172S-1

:Prototype in 2003.

==Similar weapons==
* R-37 (missile) (AA-X-13/AA-13 &#x27;Arrow&#x27;) was developed from the R-33 (missile) (AA-9 &#x27;Amos&#x27;) and is intended for the Sukhoi Su-35 Flanker-E, Sukhoi Su-37 Flanker-F, MiG 1.42 MFI and other future fighters. According to Defence Today the range depends on the flight profile, from for a direct shot to for a cruise glide profile. Jane&#x27;s reports two variants, the R-37 and the R-37M; the latter has a jettisonable rocket booster that increases the range to &quot;300-400km&quot; (160–220nmi). Work on the missile appears to have restarted in late 2006, as part of the MiG-31BM programme to update the Foxhound with a new radar and ground attack capability.
* Kh-31 (AS-17 &#x27;Krypton&#x27;) – the Chinese have licensed the anti-radar version (Kh-31P) of this Russian air-to-surface missile, and may be working on an &quot;AWACS killer&quot; variant of their YJ-91 derivative. The Russians claim the anti-shipping version, the Kh-31A, can be adapted for use as an AWACS killer.
* AIM-54 Phoenix – Now retired, a -range missile that was carried by the US Navy&#x27;s F-14 Tomcat.
* AIM-97 Seekbat - based on the Standard Missile SAM, the Seekbat was an extremely long-ranged missile designed to shoot down the MiG-25 Foxbat, which at the time had almost mythical performance estimates. When the real-world performance of the Foxbat was found to be dramatically less impressive, development was cancelled.
* AIM-174B Standard ERAM - an American long range naval surface to air missile that was developed into the &quot;AIM-174B&quot;, an air-launched version of the SM-6 for the US Navy.

<doc id="1176422" wikidata="Q2701465" url="?curid=1176422" title="The Cantos">
<text>The Cantos is a long modernist poem by Ezra Pound, written in 109 canonical sections in addition to a number of drafts and fragments added as a supplement at the request of the poem&#x27;s American publisher, James Laughlin. Most of it was written between 1915 and 1962, although much of the material in the first three cantos was abandoned or redistributed in 1923, when Pound prepared the first instalment of the poem, &quot;A Draft of XVI Cantos&quot; (Three Mountains Press, 1925). It is a book-length work, widely considered to present formidable difficulties to the reader. Strong claims have been made for it as the most significant work of modernist poetry of the twentieth century. As in Pound&#x27;s prose writing, the themes of economics, governance and culture are integral to its content.

The most striking feature of the text, to a casual browser, is the inclusion of Chinese characters as well as quotations in European languages other than English. Recourse to scholarly commentaries is almost inevitable for a close reader. The range of allusion to historical events is very broad, and abrupt changes occur with little transition. There is also wide geographical reference; Pound added to his earlier interests in the classical Mediterranean culture and East Asia selective topics from medieval and early modern Italy and Provence, the beginnings of the United States, England of the seventeenth century, and details from Africa he had obtained from Leo Frobenius.

==Structure==
&quot;The Cantos&quot; can appear on first reading to be chaotic or structureless because the poem lacks an obvious plot. R. P. Blackmur, an early critic, wrote, &quot;The work of Ezra Pound has been for most people almost as difficult to understand as Soviet Russia … &quot;The Cantos&quot; are not complex, they are complicated&quot;. Pound and T. S. Eliot had previously approached the subject of fragmentation of human experience: while Eliot was writing, and Pound editing, &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Pound had said that he looked upon experience as similar to a series of iron filings on a mirror. Each filing is disconnected, but they are drawn into the shape of a rose by the presence of a magnet.

Nevertheless, there are indications in Pound&#x27;s other writings that there may have been some formal plan underlying the work. In his 1918 essay &quot;A Retrospect&quot;, Pound wrote &quot;I think there is a &#x27;fluid&#x27; as well as a &#x27;solid&#x27; content, that some poems may have form as a tree has form, some as water poured into a vase. That most symmetrical forms have certain uses. That a vast number of subjects cannot be precisely, and therefore not properly rendered in symmetrical forms&quot;. Critics like Hugh Kenner who take a more positive view of &quot;The Cantos&quot; have tended to follow this hint, seeing the poem as a poetic record of Pound&#x27;s life and reading that sends out new branches as new needs arise with the final poem, like a tree, displaying a kind of unpredictable inevitability.

Another approach to the structure of the work is based on a letter Pound wrote to his father in the 1920s, in which he stated that his plan was:
:A. A. Live man goes down into world of dead. 
:C. B. &#x27;The repeat in history.&#x27; 
:B. C. The &#x27;magic moment&#x27; or moment of metamorphosis, bust through from quotidian into &#x27;divine or permanent world.&#x27; Gods, etc. 
[The letters ABC/ACB indicate the sequences in which the concepts could be presented.]
In the light of cantos written later than this letter, it would be possible to add other recurring motifs to this list, such as: &quot;periploi&quot; (&#x27;voyages around&#x27;); vegetation rituals such as the Eleusinian Mysteries; &quot;usura&quot;, banking and credit; and the drive towards clarity in art, such as the &#x27;clear line&#x27; of Renaissance painting and the &#x27;clear song&#x27; of the troubadours.

The poem&#x27;s symbolic structure also makes use of an opposition between darkness and light. Images of light are used variously, and may represent neoplatonic ideas of divinity, the artistic impulse, love (both sacred and physical) and good governance, among other things. The moon is frequently associated in the poem with creativity, while the sun is more often found in relation to the sphere of political and social activity, although there is frequent overlap between the two. From the &quot;Rock Drill&quot; sequence on, the poem&#x27;s effort is to merge these two aspects of light into a unified whole.

&quot;The Cantos&quot; was initially published in the form of separate sections, each containing several cantos that were numbered sequentially using Roman numerals (except cantos 85–109, first published with Arabic numerals). The original publication dates for the groups of cantos are as given below. The complete collection of cantos was published together in 1987 (including a final short coda or fragment, dated 24 August 1966). In 2002 a bilingual edition of &quot;Posthumous Cantos&quot; (&quot;Canti postumi&quot;) appeared in Italy. This is a concise selection from the mass of drafts (circa 1915–1965) uncollected or unpublished by Pound, and contains many passages that throw light on &quot;The Cantos&quot;.

==I–XVI==
:Published in 1925 as &quot;A Draft of XVI Cantos&quot; by the Three Mountains Press in Paris. 

Pound was discussing the possibility of writing a long poem since around 1905, but work did not begin until sometime in 1915. The initial versions of the first three cantos of the proposed &quot;poem of some length&quot; were published in the journal &quot;Poetry&quot;. In this version, the poem began very much as a direct address by the poet, not to the reader but to the ghost of Robert Browning. Pound came to realise that this need to be a controlling narrative voice was working against the revolutionary intent of his own poetic position, and these first three ur-cantos were soon abandoned and a new starting point sought. The answer was a Latin version of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; by the Renaissance scholar Andreas Divus that Pound had bought in Paris sometime between 1906 and 1910. Using the metre and syntax of his 1911 version of the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, Pound made an English version of Divus&#x27; rendering of the &quot;nekuia&quot; episode in which Odysseus and his companions sail to Hades to find out what their future holds. In using this passage to open the poem, Pound introduces a major theme; the excavating of the &quot;dead&quot; past to illuminate both present and future. He also echoes Dante&#x27;s opening to &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; in which the poet also descends into hell to interrogate the dead. The canto concludes with some fragments from the &quot;Second Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, in a Latin version by Georgius Dartona which Pound found in the Divus volume, followed by &quot;So that:&quot;—an invitation to read on.

Canto II opens with some lines rescued from the ur-cantos in which Pound reflects on the indeterminacy of identity by setting side by side four different versions of the troubadour poet Sordello: Browning&#x27;s poem of that name, the actual Sordello of flesh and blood, Pound&#x27;s own version of the poet and the Sordello of the brief life appended to manuscripts of his poems. These lines are followed by a sequence of identity shifts involving a seal, the daughter of Lir and other figures associated with the sea: Eleanor of Aquitaine who, through a pair of Homeric epithets that echo her name, shifts into Helen of Troy, Homer with his ear for the &quot;sea surge&quot;, the old men of Troy who want to send Helen back over the sea, and an extended, imagistic retelling of the story of the abduction of Dionysus by sailors and his transformation of his abductors into dolphins. Although this last story is found in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Dionysus&quot;, also contained in the Divus volume, Pound draws on the version in Ovid&#x27;s poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, thus introducing the world of ancient Rome into the poem.

The next five cantos (III–VII), again drawing heavily on Pound&#x27;s Imagist past for their technique, are essentially based in the Mediterranean, drawing on classical mythology, Renaissance history, the world of the troubadours, Sappho&#x27;s poetry, a scene from the legend of El Cid that introduces the theme of banking and credit, and Pound&#x27;s own visits to Venice to create a textual collage saturated with neoplatonist images of clarity and light.

Cantos VIII–XI draw on the story of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, 15th-century poet, condottiero, lord of Rimini and patron of the arts. Quoting extensively from primary sources, including Malatesta&#x27;s letters, Pound especially focuses on the building of the church of San Francesco, also known as the Tempio Malatestiano. Designed by Leon Battista Alberti and decorated by artists including Piero della Francesca and Agostino di Duccio, this was a landmark Renaissance building, being the first church to use the Roman triumphal arch as part of its structure. For Pound, who spent a good deal of time seeking patrons for himself, James Joyce, Eliot and a string of little magazines and small presses, the role of the patron was a crucial cultural question, and Malatesta is the first in a line of ruler-patrons to appear in &quot;The Cantos&quot;.

Canto XII consists of three moral tales on the subject of profit. The first and third of these treat of the creation of profit &quot;ex nihilo&quot; by exploiting the money supply, comparing this activity with &quot;unnatural&quot; fertility. The central parable contrasts this with wealth-creation based on the creation of useful goods. Canto XIII then introduces Confucius, or Kung, who is presented as the embodiment of the ideal of social order based on ethics.

This section of &quot;The Cantos&quot; concludes with a vision of hell. Cantos XIV and XV use the convention of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; to present Pound/Dante moving through a hell populated by bankers, newspaper editors, hack writers and other &#x27;perverters of language&#x27; and the social order. In Canto XV, Plotinus takes the role of guide played by Virgil in Dante&#x27;s poem. In Canto XVI, Pound emerges from Hell and into an earthly paradise where he sees some of the personages encountered in earlier cantos. The poem then moves to recollections of World War I, and of Pound&#x27;s writer and artist friends who fought in it. These include Richard Aldington, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Wyndham Lewis, Ernest Hemingway and Fernand Léger, whose war memories the poem includes a passage from (in French). Finally, there is a transcript of Lincoln Steffens&#x27; account of the Russian Revolution. These two events, the war and revolution, mark a decisive break with the historic past, including the early modernist period when these writers and artists formed a more-or-less coherent movement.

==XVII–XXX==
:XVII–XXVII was published by John Rodker in London in 1928 in a luxury edition called &quot;A Draft of the Cantos 17–27 of Ezra Pound&quot;: With Initials by Gladys Hynes. Pound then wrote three more cantos for Cantos I–XXX published in 1930 in &quot;A Draft of XXX Cantos&quot; by Nancy Cunard&#x27;s Hours Press. 

Originally, Pound conceived of Cantos XVII–XXVII as a group that would follow the first volume by starting with the Renaissance and ending with the Russian Revolution. The major locus of these cantos is the city of Venice.

Canto XVII opens with the words &quot;So that&quot;, echoing the end of Canto I, and then moves on to another Dionysus-related metamorphosis story. The rest of the canto is concerned with Venice, which is portrayed as a stone forest growing out of the water. Cantos XVIII and XIX return to the theme of financial exploitation, beginning with the Venetian explorer Marco Polo&#x27;s account of Kublai Khan&#x27;s paper money. Canto XIX deals mainly with those who profit from war, returning briefly to the Russian Revolution, and ends on the evil of wars and those who promote them.

Canto XX opens with a grouping of phrases, words and images from Mediterranean poetry, ranging from Homer through Ovid, Propertius and Catullus to the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; and Arnaut Daniel. These fragments constellate to form an exemplum of what Pound calls &quot;clear song&quot;. There follows another exemplum, this time of the linguistic scholarship that enables us to read these old poetries and the specific attention to words this study requires. Finally, this &quot;clear song&quot; and intellectual activity is implicitly contrasted with the inertia and indolence of the lotus eaters. There are references to the Malatesta family and to Borso d&#x27;Este, who tried to keep the peace between the warring Italian city states.

Canto XXI deals with the difference of patronage between the Medici family, especially Lorenzo the Magnificent and Thomas Jefferson. A phrase from one of Sigismundo Malatesta&#x27;s letters inserted into the Jefferson passage (&quot;affatigandose per suo piacere o no&quot;) draws an explicit parallel between the two men – neither had the financial power of the Medici, yet assisted in the production of art even though they were of relatively modest means and far from the centres of culture. The next canto continues the focus on finance by introducing the Social Credit theories of C.H. Douglas for the first time.

Canto XXIII returns to the world of the troubadours via Homer and Renaissance neo-platonism. Pound saw Provençal culture as a nexus of survival of the old pagan beliefs, and the destruction of the Cathar stronghold at Montsegur at the end of the Albigensian Crusade is held up as an example of the tendency of authority to crush all such alternative cultures. The destruction of Mont Segur is implicitly compared with the destruction of Troy in the closing lines of the canto. 

Canto XXIV then returns to 15th-century Italy and the d&#x27;Este family, again focusing on their Venetian activities and Niccolo d&#x27;Este&#x27;s voyage to the Holy Land.

Cantos XXV draws on the Book of the Council Major in Venice and Pound&#x27;s personal memories of the city. Anecdotes on Titian and Mozart deal with the relationship between artist and patron. Cantos XXVI is a history of Venice.
Canto XXVII outlines the Russian Revolution, which is seen as being destructive, not constructive, and echoes the ruin of Eblis from Canto VI. 

XXVIII returns to the contemporary scene, with a passage on transatlantic flight. The last two cantos in the series return to the world of &quot;clear song&quot;. In Canto XXIX, a story from their visit to the Provençal site at Excideuil contrasts Pound and Eliot on the subject of Christianity, with Pound implicitly rejecting that religion. Finally, the series closes with a glimpse of the printer Hieronymus Soncinus of Fano preparing to print the works of Petrarch.

==XXXI–XLI (Eleven New Cantos)==

:Published as &quot;Eleven New Cantos XXXI–XLI&quot;. New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart Inc., 1934.
The first four cantos of this volume (Cantos XXXI–XXXIV) quote extensively from the letters of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and the diary of John Quincy Adams, to deal with the emergence of the fledgling United States. Canto XXXI opens with the Malatesta family motto &quot;Tempus loquendi, tempus tacendi&quot; (&quot;a time to speak, a time to be silent&quot;) to link again Jefferson and Sigismundo as individuals and the Italian and American &quot;rebirths&quot; as historical movements.

Canto XXXV contrasts the dynamism of Revolutionary America with the &quot;general indefinite wobble&quot; of the decaying aristocratic society of Mitteleuropa, the Austro-Hungarian empire. This canto contains some distinctly unpleasant expressions of anti-Semitic opinions. 
Canto XXXVI opens with a translation of Cavalcanti&#x27;s canzone &quot;Donna mi pregha&quot; (&quot;A lady asks me&quot;). This poem, a lyric meditation on the nature and philosophy of love, was a touchstone text for Pound. He saw it as an example of the post-Montsegur survival of the Provençal tradition of &quot;clear song&quot;, precision of thought and language, and nonconformity of belief. The canto then continues with the figure of the 9th-century Irish philosopher and poet John Scotus Eriugena, who was an influence on the Cathars and whose writings were condemned as heretical in both the 11th and 13th centuries, and closes with the Italian poet Sordello. 
Canto XXXVII then returns to the period before the civil war in the United States with a portrait of the American President Martin Van Buren, focusing on the period he was vice-president to Andrew Jackson, who, following his repayment of the debt of the revolutionary war of independence, also ended the Second Bank of the United States in the so-called &quot;Bank War&quot; of 1829–1836.

Canto XXXVIII opens with a quotation from Dante in which he rightly accuses the king of France Philip the Fair, of falsifying the coinage. The canto then turns to modern commerce and the arms trade. The canto has acquired a certain notoriety among scholars for its succinct account of C.H. Douglas&#x27;s A+B Theorem, which spells out the basis of the Social Credit theory. 
Canto XXXIX returns to the island of Circe and the events before the voyage undertaken in the first canto and unfolds as a hymn to natural fertility and ritual sex. 
Canto XL is a diptych: the first section is dedicated to a summary of J. P. Morgan&#x27;s fraudulent financial career; this is followed by another periplus, a condensed version of Hanno the Navigator&#x27;s account of his voyage along the West coast of Africa. 
The collection ends with canto XLI balancing an account of Benito Mussolini during WWI and Thomas Jefferson in Paris, just before the French Revolution.

==XLII–LI (The Fifth Decad)==
:Published as &quot;The Fifth Decad of the Cantos XLII–LI&quot;. London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1937.

Cantos XLII, XLIII and XLIV move to the Sienese bank, the Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and to the 18th-century reforms of Pietro Leopoldo, Habsburg Arch Duke of Tuscany. Founded in 1624, the Monte dei Paschi was a low-interest, credit institution whose funds were guaranteed by taxing the grazing of sheep on community land (the &quot;BANK of the grassland&quot; of Canto XLIII). 
Canto XLV is a litany against &quot;Usura&quot; or usury, which Pound later defined as a charge on credit regardless of actual production focusing on examples from the arts in which cultural creation is independent of the market. The canto declares usury is both contrary to the laws of nature and inimical to the production of good art and culture. Pound later came to see this canto as a key central point in the poem. 
Canto XLVI presents the dark heart of usury, i.e. the procedures whereby money is created in liberal institutions such as the Bank of England. In Pound&#x27;s view, issuing money as a form of state debt was contributing to poverty, social deprivation, crime and implicitly to &quot;bad&quot; art made as a form of investment and profit. At the time of writing the canto (1935) The Bank of England was still a private company, whose activities were primarily subjected to shareholder interest not the British government. The Bank was nationalised in 1946.

The poem returns to the island of Circe and Odysseus about to &quot;sail after knowledge&quot; in Canto XLVII. There follows a long lyrical passage in which a ritual of floating votive candles on the bay at Rapallo near Pound&#x27;s home every July merges with the cognate myths of Tammuz and Adonis, agricultural activity set in a calendar based on natural cycles, and fertility rituals.

Canto XLVIII presents a suite of instances of what Pound considers to be the degradation of intelligence and civilisation due to usury. At the same time he proposes remedies: travel and exploration, as well as sexual and religious freedom.

Canto XLIX is a poem of tranquil nature derived from a Chinese picture book that Pound&#x27;s parents brought with them when they retired to Rapallo. 
Canto L is an investigation of a theory by one of the writers that Pound was in contact with, namely Robert McNair Wilson, a specialist in the life of Napoleon. Wilson&#x27;s idea was that Bonaparte had been a flawed hero who had fought and been crushed by usury. The canto actively follows this idea but finds rather that Napoleon did not change the financial arrangements of his day, or had any progressive economic idea. Pound also shows how the Rothschild family actively helped the British and Austrian cause against him.
The final canto in this sequence returns to the usura litany of Canto XLV, followed by detailed instructions on making flies for fishing (man in harmony with nature) and ends with a reference to the anti-Venetian League of Cambrai. They decad ends with the first Chinese written characters to appear in the poem, representing the Rectification of Names from the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (the ideogram representing honesty at the end of Canto XXXIV was added when &quot;The Cantos&quot; was published as a single volume).

==LII–LXI (The Chinese History Cantos)==

:First published in &quot;Cantos LII–LXXI&quot;. Norfolk Conn.: New Directions, 1940.
These cantos are based on the first eleven volumes of the twelve-volume &quot;Histoire generale de la Chine&quot; by Joseph-Anna-Marie de Moyriac de Mailla. De Mailla was a French Jesuit who spent 37 years in Peking and wrote his history there. The work was completed in 1730 but not published until 1777–1783. De Mailla was very much an Enlightenment figure and his view of Chinese history reflects this; he found Confucian political philosophy, with its emphasis on rational order, much to his liking. He also disliked what he saw as the superstitious pseudo-mysticism promulgated by both Buddhists and Taoists, to the detriment of rational politics. Pound, in turn, fitted de Mailla&#x27;s take on China into his own views on Christianity, the need for strong leadership to address 20th-century fiscal and cultural problems, and his support of Mussolini. In an introductory note to the section, Pound is at pains to point out that the ideograms and other fragments of foreign-language text incorporated in &quot;The Cantos&quot; should not put the reader off, as they serve to underline things that are in the English text.

Canto LII is a diptych contrasting the Western world eroded by usury with the beginnings of Chinese civilisation as evident in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, especially those parts that deal with agriculture and natural increase. The diction is the same as that used in earlier cantos on similar subjects.

Canto LIII covers the period from the founding of the Xia dynasty up to circa 225 BCE including the life of Confucius in the 5th century BC. Special mention is made of emperors that Confucius approved of and the sage&#x27;s interest in cultural matters is stressed. For example, we are told that he edited the &quot;Book of Odes&quot;, cutting it from 3000 to 300 poems. Canto LIV moves the story on to around 805 CE. from the first emperor Qin Shi Huang to the middle of the Tang dynasty.

Canto LV is mainly concerned with the decadence of the Tang, The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom&#x27;s period and the rise of the Song dynasty, including the rise of the Tatars and the Tartar Wars, ending about 1200. There is a lot on money policy in this canto and Pound quotes approvingly the Tartar ruler Oulo who noted that the people &quot;cannot eat jewels&quot;. This is echoed in Canto LVI when KinKwa remarks that both gold and jade are inedible. This canto is mainly concerned with Ghengis and Kublai Khan and the rise of their Yeun dynasty. The canto closes with the overthrow of the Yuan and the establishment of the Ming dynasty, bringing us to around 1400.

Canto LVII opens with the story of the flight of the emperor Kien Ouen Ti in 1402 or 1403 and continues with the history of the Ming up to the middle of the 16th century. Canto LVIII opens with a condensed history of Japan from the legendary first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, who supposedly ruled in the 7th century BCE, to the late 16th-century Toyotomi Hideyoshi (anglicised by Pound as Messier Undertree), who issued edicts against Christianity and raided Korea, thus putting pressure on China&#x27;s eastern borders. The canto then goes on to outline the concurrent pressure placed on the western borders by activities associated with the great Tartar horse fairs, leading to the rise of the Manchu dynasty.

The translation of the Confucian classics into Manchu opens the following canto, Canto LIX. The canto is then concerned with the increasing European interest in China during the reign of Emperor Kang Xi, as evidenced by the Sino-Russian border treaty in 1684 and the founding of the Jesuit mission in 1685 under Jean-François Gerbillon. Canto LX deals with the activities of the Jesuits, who, we are told, introduced astronomy, western music, physics and the use of quinine. The canto ends with limitations being placed on Christians, who had come to be seen as enemies of the state.

The final canto in the sequence, Canto LXI, covers the reigns of Yong Tching and Kien Long, bringing the story up to 1790. Yong Tching is shown banning Christianity as &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;seeking to uproot Kung&#x27;s laws&quot;. He also established just prices for foodstuffs, bringing us back to the ideas of Social Credit. There are also references to the Italian Risorgimento, John Adams, and Dom Metello de Souza, who gained some measure of relief for the Jesuit mission.

==LXII–LXXI (The Adams Cantos)==

:First published in &quot;Cantos LII–LXXI&quot;. Norfolk Conn.: New Directions, 1940.
This section of the cantos is, for the most part, made up of fragmentary citations from the writings of John Adams. Pound&#x27;s intentions appear to be to show Adams as an example of the rational Enlightenment leader, thereby continuing the primary theme of the preceding China Cantos sequence, which these cantos also follow from chronologically. Adams is depicted as a rounded figure; he is a strong leader with interests in political, legal and cultural matters in much the same way that Malatesta and Mussolini are portrayed elsewhere in the poem. The English jurist Sir Edward Coke, who is an important figure in some later cantos, first appears in this section of the poem. Given the fragmentary nature of the citations used, these cantos can be quite difficult to follow for the reader with no knowledge of the history of the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Canto LXII opens with a brief history of the Adams family in America from 1628. The rest of the canto is concerned with events leading up to the revolution, Adams&#x27; time in France, and the formation of Washington&#x27;s administration. Alexander Hamilton reappears, again cast as the villain of the piece. The appearance of the single Greek word &quot;THUMON&quot;, meaning heart, returns us to the world of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Pound&#x27;s use of Odysseus as a model for all his heroes, including Adams. The word is used of Odysseus in the fourth line of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;: &quot;he suffered woes in his heart on the seas&quot;.

The next canto, Canto LXIII, is concerned with Adams&#x27; career as a lawyer and especially his reports of the legal arguments presented by James Otis in the Writ of assistance case and their importance in the build-up to the revolution. The Latin phrase &quot; Eripuit caelo fulmen&quot; (&quot;He snatched the thunderbolt from heaven&quot;) is taken from an inscription on a bust of Benjamin Franklin. Cavalcanti&#x27;s canzone, Pound&#x27;s touchstone text of clear intellection and precision of language, reappears with the insertion of the lines &quot;In quella parte / dove sta memoria&quot; into the text.

Canto LXIV covers the Stamp act and other resistance to British taxation of the American colonies. It also shows Adams defending the accused in the Boston massacre and engaging in agricultural experiments to ascertain the suitability of Old-World crops for American conditions. The phrases &quot;Cumis ego oculis meis&quot;, &quot;tu theleis&quot;, &quot;respondebat illa&quot; and &quot;apothanein&quot; are from the passage (taken from Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;) that T.S. Eliot used as epigraph to &quot;The Waste Land&quot; at Pound&#x27;s suggestion. The passage translates as &quot;For with my own eyes I saw the Sibyl hanging in a jar at Cumae, and when the boys said to her, &#x27;Sibyl, what do you want?&#x27; she replied, &#x27;I want to die.&#x27;&quot;

The nomination of Washington as president dominates the opening pages of Canto LXV. The canto shows Adams concerned with the practicalities of waging war, particularly of establishing a navy. Following a passage on the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the canto returns to Adams&#x27; mission to France, focusing on his dealings with the American legation in that country, consisting of Franklin, Silas Deane and Edward Bancroft and with the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes. Intertwined with this is the fight to save the rights of Americans to fish the Atlantic coastline. A passage on Adams&#x27; opposition to American involvement in European wars is highlighted, echoing Pound&#x27;s position on his own times. In Canto LXVI, we see Adams in London serving as minister to the Court of St James&#x27;s. The body of the canto consists of quotations from Adams&#x27; writings on the legal basis for the Revolution, including citations from Magna Carta and Coke and on the importance of trial by jury (&quot;per pares et legem terrae&quot;).

Canto LXVII opens with a passage on the limits on the powers of the British monarch drawn from Adams&#x27; writings under the pseudonym Novanglus. The rest of the canto is concerned with the study of government and with the requirements of the franchise. The following canto, LXVIII, begins with a meditation on the tripartite division of society into the one, the few and the many. A parallel is drawn between Adams and Lycurgus, king of Sparta. Then the canto returns to Adams&#x27; notes on the practicalities of funding the war and the negotiation of a loan from the Dutch.

Canto LXIX continues the subject of the Dutch loan and then turns to Adams&#x27; fear of the emergence of a native aristocracy in America, as noted in his remark that Jefferson feared rule by &quot;the one&quot; (monarch or dictator), while he, Adams, feared &quot;the few&quot;. The remainder of the canto is concerned with Hamilton, James Madison and the affair of the assumption of debt certificates by Congress which resulted in a significant shift of economic power to the federal government from the individual states.

Canto LXX deals mainly with Adams&#x27; time as vice-president and president, focusing on his statement &quot;I am for balance&quot;, highlighted in the text by the addition of the ideogram for balance. The section ends with Canto LXXI, which summarises many of the themes of the foregoing cantos and adds material on Adams&#x27; relationship with Native Americans and their treatment by the British during the Indian Wars. The canto closes with the opening lines of Epictetus&#x27; &quot;Hymn of Cleanthus&quot;, which Pound tells us formed part of Adams&#x27; &quot;paideuma&quot;. These lines invoke Zeus as one &quot;who rules by law&quot;, a clear parallel to the Adams presented by Pound.

==LXXII–LXXIII (The Italian Cantos) ==
:Written between 1944 and 1945.
These two cantos, written in Italian, were not collected until their posthumous inclusion in the 1987 revision of the complete text of the poem. Pound reverts to the model of Dante’s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and casts himself as conversing with ghosts from Italy&#x27;s remote and recent past.

In Canto LXXII, imitative of Dante&#x27;s tercets (&quot;terza rima&quot;), Pound meets the recently dead Futurist writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and they discuss the current war and their excessive love of the past (Pound) and of the future (Marinetti). Then the violent ghost of Dante&#x27;s Ezzelino III da Romano, brother of Cunizza of Cantos VI and XXIX, explains to Pound that he has been misrepresented as an evil tyrant only because he was against the Pope&#x27;s party, and goes on to attack the present Pope Pius XII and &quot;traitors&quot; (like king Victor Emmanuel III) who betrayed Mussolini, and to promise that the Italian troops will eventually &quot;return&quot; to El Alamein.

Canto LXXIII is subtitled &quot;Cavalcanti – Republican Correspondence&quot; and is written in the style of Cavalcanti&#x27;s &quot;Donna mi prega&quot; of Canto XXXVI. Guido Cavalcanti appears on horseback to tell Pound about a heroic deed of a girl from Rimini who led a troop of Canadian soldiers to a mined field and died with the &quot;enemy&quot;. (This was a propaganda story featured in Italian newspapers in October 1944; Pound was interested in it because of the connection with Sigismondo Malatesta&#x27;s Rimini.) Both cantos end on a positive and optimistic note, typical of Pound, and are unusually straightforward. Except for a scathing reference (by Cavalcanti&#x27;s ghost) to &quot;Roosevelt, Churchill and Eden / bastards and small Jews&quot;, and for a denial (by Ezzelino) that &quot;the world was created by a Jew&quot;, they are notably free of anti-Semitic content, although it must be said that there are several positive references to Italian fascism and some racist expressions (e.g., &quot;Son marocchini ed altra immondizia&quot;—&quot;They are Moroccans and other trash&quot;, Canto LXXII). Italian scholars have been intrigued by Pound&#x27;s idiosyncratic recreation of the poetry of Dante and Cavalcanti.

==LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)==

:First published as &quot;The Pisan Cantos&quot;. New York: New Directions, 1948.
With the outbreak of war in 1939, Pound was in Italy, where he remained, despite a request for repatriation he made after Pearl Harbor. During this period, his main source of income was a series of radio broadcasts he made on Rome Radio. He used these broadcasts to express his full range of opinions on culture, politics and economics, including his opposition to American involvement in a European war and his anti-Semitism. In 1943, he was indicted for treason in his absence, and wrote a letter to the indicting judge in which he claimed the right to freedom of speech in his defence.

Pound was arrested by Italian partisans in April 1945 and was eventually transferred to the American Disciplinary Training Center (DTC) on 22 May. Here he was held in a specially reinforced cage, initially sleeping on the ground in the open air. After three weeks, he had a breakdown that resulted in his being given a cot and pup tent in the medical compound. Here, he gained access to a typewriter. For reading matter, he had a regulation-issue Bible along with three books he was allowed to bring in as his own &quot;religious&quot; texts: a Chinese text of Confucius, James Legge&#x27;s translation of the same, and a Chinese dictionary. He later found a copy of the &quot;Pocket Book of Verse&quot;, edited by Morris Edmund Speare, in the latrine. The only other thing he brought with him was a eucalyptus pip. Throughout the Pisan sequence, Pound repeatedly likens the camp to Francesco del Cossa&#x27;s &quot;March&quot; fresco depicting men working at a grape arbour.

With his political certainties collapsing around him and his library inaccessible, Pound turned inward for his materials and much of the Pisan sequence is concerned with memory, especially of his years in London and Paris and of the writers and artists he knew in those cities. There is also a deepening of the ecological concerns of the poem. The awarding of the Bollingen Prize to the book caused considerable controversy, with many people objecting to the honouring of someone they saw as a madman and/or traitor. However, &quot;The Pisan Cantos&quot; is generally the most admired and read section of the work. It is also among the most influential, having affected poets as different as H.D. and Gary Snyder.

Canto LXXIV immediately introduces the reader to the method used in the Pisan Cantos, which is one of interweaving themes somewhat in the manner of a fugue. These themes pick up on many of the concerns of the earlier cantos and frequently run across sections of the Pisan sequence. This canto begins with Pound looking out of the DTC at peasants working in the fields nearby and reflecting on the news of the death of Mussolini, &quot;hung by the heels&quot;.

In the first thread, the figure of Pound/Odysseus reappears in the guise of &quot;OY TIS&quot;, or no man, the name the hero uses in the Cyclops episode of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. This figure blends into the Australia rain god Wanjina, who had his mouth closed up by his father (was deprived of freedom of speech) because he &quot;created too many things&quot;. He, in turn, becomes the Chinese &quot;Ouan Jin&quot;, or man with an education. This theme recurs in the line &quot;a man on whom the sun has gone down&quot;, a reference to the &quot;nekuia&quot; from Canto I, which is then explicitly referred to. This recalls &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and Pound quotes a line from his translation, &quot;Lordly men are to earth o&#x27;ergiven&quot;, lamenting the loss of the exiled poet&#x27;s companions. This is then applied to a number of Pound&#x27;s dead friends from the London/Paris years, including W. B. Yeats, Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, Victor Plarr and Henry James. Finally, Pound/Odysseus is seen &quot;on a raft blown by the wind&quot;.

Another major theme running through this canto is that of the vision of a goddess in the poet&#x27;s tent. This starts from the identification of a nearby mountain with the Chinese holy mountain Taishan and the naming of the moon as &quot;sorella la luna&quot; (sister moon). This thread then runs through the appearance of Kuanon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, the moon spirit from &quot;Hagaromo&quot; (a Noh play translated by Pound some 40 years earlier), Sigismondo&#x27;s lover Ixotta (linked in the text with Aphrodite via a reference to the goddess&#x27; birthplace Cythera), a girl painted by Édouard Manet and finally Aphrodite herself, rising from the sea on her shell and rescuing Pound/Odysseus from his raft. The two threads are further linked by the placement of the Greek word &quot;brododactylos&quot; (&quot;rosy-fingered&quot;) applied by Homer to the dawn but given here in the dialect of Sappho and used by her in a poem of unrequited love. These images are often intimately associated with the poet&#x27;s close observation of the natural world as it imposes itself on the camp; birds, a lizard, clouds, the weather and other images of nature run through the canto.

Images of light and brightness associated with these goddesses come to focus in the phrase &quot;all things that are, are lights&quot; quoted from John Scotus Eriugena. He, in turn, brings us back to the Albigensian Crusade and the troubadour world of Bernard de Ventadorn. Another theme sees Ecbatana, the seven-walled &quot;city of Dioce&quot;, blend with the city of Wagadu, from the tale of &quot;Gassire&#x27;s Lute&quot; that Pound learned from Frobenius. This city, four times rebuilt, with its four walls, four gates and four towers at the corners is a symbol for spiritual endurance. It, in turn, blends with the DTC in which the poet is imprisoned.

The question of banking and money also recurs, with an anti-Semitic passage aimed at the banker Meyer Anselm (probably Meyer Rothschild). Pound brings in biblical injunctions on usury and a reference to the issuing of a stamp scrip currency in the Austrian town of Wörgl. The canto then moves on to a longish passage of memories of the moribund literary scene Pound encountered in London when he first arrived, with the phrase &quot;beauty is difficult&quot;, quoted from Aubrey Beardsley, acting as a refrain. After more memories of America and Venice, the canto ends in a passage that brings together Dante&#x27;s celestial rose, the rose formed by the effect of a magnet on iron filings, an image from Paul Verlaine of the human soul as a fountain and a reference to a poem by Ben Jonson in a composite image of hope for &quot;those who have passed over Lethe&quot;.

Canto LXXV is mainly a facsimile of the German pianist Gerhart Münch&#x27;s violin setting of the 16th-century Italian Francesco Da Milano&#x27;s transcription for lute of French composer Clément Janequin&#x27;s choral work &quot;Le Chant des oiseaux&quot;, an ancient song recalled to Pound&#x27;s mind by the singing of birds on the fence of the DTC, and a symbol for him of an indestructible form preserved and transmitted through many versions, times, nations and artists. (Compare the &quot;nekuia&quot; of canto I.) Münch was a friend and collaborator of Pound in Rapallo, and the short prose section at the beginning of the canto celebrates his work on other early music figures.

Canto LXXVI opens with a vision of a group of goddesses in Pound&#x27;s room on the Rapallo hillside and then moves, via Mont Segur, to memories of Paris and Jean Cocteau. There follows a passage in which the poet recognises the Jewish authorship of the prohibition on usury found in Leviticus. Conversations in the camp are then cross-cut into memories of Provence and Venice, details of the American Revolution and further visions. These memories lead to a consideration of what has or may have been destroyed in the war. Pound remembers the moment in Venice when he decided not to destroy his first book of verse, &quot;A Lume Spento&quot;, an affirmation of his decision to become a poet and a decision that ultimately led to his incarceration in the DTC. The canto ends with the goddess, in the form of a butterfly, leaving the poet&#x27;s tent amid further references to Sappho and Homer.

The main focus of Canto LXXVII is accurate use of language, and at its centre is the moment when Pound hears that the war is over. Pound draws on examples of language use from Confucius, the Japanese dancer Michio Itô, who worked with Pound and Yeats in London, a Dublin cab driver, Aristotle, Basil Bunting, Yeats, Joyce and the vocabulary of the U.S. Army. The goddess in her various guises appears again, as does Awoi&#x27;s &quot;hennia&quot;, the spirit of jealousy from &quot;AOI NO UE&quot;, a Noh play translated by Pound. The canto closes with an invocation of Dionysus (&quot;Zagreus&quot;).

After opening with a glimpse of Mount Ida, an important locus for the history of the Trojan War, Canto LXXVIII moves through much that is familiar from the earlier cantos in the sequence: del Cossa, the economic basis of war, Pound&#x27;s writer and artist friends in London, &quot;virtuous&quot; rulers (Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the emperors Justinian, Titus and Antoninus, Mussolini), usury and stamp scripts culminating in the Nausicaa episode from the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and a reference to the Confucian classic &quot;Annals of Spring and Autumn&quot; in which &quot;there are no righteous wars&quot;.

The moon and clouds appear at the opening of Canto LXXIX, which then moves on through a passage in which birds on the wire fence recall musical notation and the sounds of the camp and thoughts of Mozart, del Cossa and Marshal Pétain meld to form musical counterpoint. After references to politics, economics, and the nobility of the world of the Noh and the ritual dance of the moon-nymph in Hagaromo that dispels mortal doubt, the canto closes with an extended fertility hymn to Dionysus in the guise of his sacred lynx.

Canto LXXX opens in the camp in the shadow of death and soon turns to memories of London, Paris and Spain, including a recollection of Walter Rummel, who worked with Pound on troubadour music before World War I and of Eliot, Lewis, Laurence Binyon and others. The canto is concerned with the aftermath of war, drawing on Yeats&#x27; experiences after the Irish Civil War as well as the contemporary situation. Hagoromo appears again before the poem returns to Beardsley, also in the shadow of death, declaring the difficulty of beauty with a phrase from Symons and Sappho/Homer&#x27;s rosy-fingered dawn woven through the passage.

Pound writes of the decline of the sense of the spirit in painting from a high-point in Sandro Botticelli to the fleshiness of Rubens and its recovery in the 20th century as evidenced in the works of Marie Laurencin and others. This is set between two further references to Mont Segur. Pound/Odysseus is then saved from his sinking raft by Walt Whitman and Richard Lovelace as discovered in the anthology of poetry found in the camp toilet and the other prisoners are compared with Odysseus&#x27; crew, &quot;men of no fortune&quot;. The canto then closes with two passages, one a pastiche of Browning, the other of Edward Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;, lamenting the lost London of Pound&#x27;s youth and an image of nature as designer.

Canto LXXXI opens with a complex image that illustrates Pound&#x27;s technical approach well. The opening line, &quot;Zeus lies in Ceres bosom&quot;, merges the conception of Demeter, passages in previous cantos on ritual copulation as a means of ensuring fertility, and the direct experience of the sun (Zeus) still hidden at dawn by two hills resembling breasts in the Pisan landscape. This is followed by an image of the other mountain that reminded the poet of Taishan surrounded by vapors and surmounted by the planet Venus (&quot;Taishan is attended of loves / under Cythera, before sunrise&quot;).

The canto then moves through memories of Spain, a story told by Basil Bunting, and anecdotes of a number of familiar personages and of George Santayana. At the core of this passage is the line &quot;(to break the pentameter, that was the first heave)&quot;, Pound&#x27;s comment on the &quot;revolution of the word&quot; that led to the emergence of Modernist poetry in the early years of the century.

The goddess of love then returns after a lyric passage situating Pound&#x27;s work in the great tradition of English lyric, in the sense of words intended to be sung. This heralds perhaps the most widely quoted passages in &quot;The Cantos&quot;, in which Pound expresses his realisation that &quot;What thou lovest well remains, / the rest is dross&quot; and an acceptance of the need for human humility in the face of the natural world that prefigures some of the ideas associated with the deep ecology movement.

The opening of Canto LXXXII marks a return to the camp and its inmates. This is followed by a passage that draws on Pound&#x27;s London memories and his reading of the &quot;Pocket Book of Verse&quot;. Pound laments his failure to recognise the Greek qualities of Swinburne&#x27;s work and celebrates Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Rudyard Kipling, Ford, Whitman, Yeats and others. After an expanded clarification of the &quot;Annals of Spring and Autumn&quot; / &quot;there are no righteous wars&quot; passage from Canto LXXVIII, this canto culminates in images of the poet drowning in earth and a recurrence of the Greek word for weeping, ending with more bird-notes seen as a periplum.

After a number of cantos in which the elements of earth and air feature so strongly, Canto LXXXIII opens with images of water and light, drawn from Pindar, George Gemistos Plethon, John Scotus Eriugena, the mermaid carvings of Pietro Lombardo and Heraclitus&#x27; phrase &quot;panta rei&quot; (&quot;everything flows&quot;). A passage addressed to a Dryad speaks out against the death sentence and cages for wild animals and is followed by lines on equity in government and natural processes based on the writings of Mencius. The tone of placid acceptance is underscored by three Chinese characters that translate as &quot;don&#x27;t help to grow that which will grow of itself&quot; followed by another appearance of the Greek word for weeping in the context of remembered places.

Close observation of a wasp building a mud nest returns the canto to earth and to the figure of Tiresias, last encountered in Cantos I and XLVII. The canto moves on through a long passage remembering Pound&#x27;s time as Yeats&#x27; secretary in 1914 and a shorter meditation on the decline in standards in public life deriving from a remembered visit to the senate in the company of Pound&#x27;s mother while that house was in session. The closing lines, &quot;Down derry-down / Oh let an old man rest&quot;, return the poem from the world of memory to the poet&#x27;s present plight.

Canto LXXXIV opens with the delivery of Dorothy Pound&#x27;s first letter to the DTC on 8 October. This letter contained news of the death in the war of J.P. Angold, a young English poet whom Pound admired. This news is woven through phrases from a lament by the troubadour Bertran de Born (which Pound had once translated as &quot;Planh for the Young English King&quot;) and a double occurrence of the Greek word &quot;tethneke&quot; (&quot;is dead&quot;) remembered from the story of the death of Pan in Canto XXIII. 

This death, reviving memories of the poet&#x27;s dead friends from World War I, is followed by a passage on Pound&#x27;s 1939 visit to Washington, D.C. to try to avert American involvement in the forthcoming European war. Much of the rest of the canto is concerned with the economic basis of war and the general lack of interest in this subject on the part of historians and politicians; John Adams is again held up as an ideal. The canto also contains a reproduction, in Italian, of a conversation between the poet and a &quot;swineherd&#x27;s sister&quot; through the DTC fence. He asks her if the American troops behave well and she replies OK. He then asks how they compare to the Germans and she replies that they are the same.

The moon/goddess reappears at the core of the canto as &quot;pin-up&quot; and &quot;chronometer&quot; close to the line &quot;out of all this beauty something must come&quot;. The closing lines of the canto, and of the sequence, &quot;If the hoar frost grip thy tent / Thou wilt give thanks when night is spent&quot;, sound a final note of acceptance and resignation, despite the return to the sphere of action, prompted by the death of Angold, that marks most of the canto.

==LXXXV–XCV (Section: Rock-Drill)==
:Published in 1956 as &quot;Section: Rock-Drill, 85–95 de los cantares&quot; by New Directions, New York.

Pound was flown from Pisa to Washington to face trial on a charge of treason in 1946. Found unfit to stand trial because of the state of his mental health, he was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital, where he was to remain until 1958. Here he began to entertain writers and academics with an interest in his work and to write, working on translations of the Confucian &quot;Book of Odes&quot; and of Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Women of Trachis&quot; and two new sections of the cantos; the first of these was &quot;Rock Drill&quot;.
The two main written sources for the &quot;Rock Drill&quot; cantos are the Confucian &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, in an edition by the French Jesuit Séraphin Couvreur, which contained the Chinese text and translations into Latin and French under the title &quot;Chou King&quot; (which Pound uses in the poem), and Senator Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Years View: Or A History of the American Government for Thirty Years From 1820–1850&quot;, which covers the period of the bank wars. In an interview given in 1962, and reprinted by J. P. Sullivan, Pound said that the title &quot;Rock Drill&quot; &quot;was intended to imply the necessary resistance in getting a main thesis across — hammering.&quot;

The first canto in the sequence, Canto LXXXV, contains 104 Chinese characters from the &quot;Chou King&quot;, in addition to a number of Latin phrases, mostly taken from Couvreur&#x27;s translation. There are also a small number of Greek words. The overall effect for the English-speaking reader is one of unreadability, and the canto is hard to elucidate unless read alongside a copy of Couvreur&#x27;s text. 

The core meaning is summed up in Pound&#x27;s footnote to the effect that the History Classic contains the essentials of the Confucian view of good government. In the canto, these are summed up in the line &quot;Our dynasty came in because of a great sensibility&quot;, where sensibility translates the key character Ling, and in the reference to the four Tuan, or foundations, benevolence, rectitude, manners and knowledge. Rulers who Pound viewed as embodying some or all of these characteristics are adduced: Queen Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, Alexander the Great, as are Napoleon III, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Dexter White, who stand for everything Pound opposes in government and finance.

The world of nature, Pound&#x27;s source of wealth and spiritual nourishment, also features strongly; images of roots, grass and surviving traces of fertility rites in Catholic Italy cluster around the sacred tree Yggdrasil. The natural world and the world of government are related to &quot;tekhne&quot; or art. Richard of Saint Victor, with his emphasis on modes of thinking, makes an appearance, in close company with Eriugena, the philosopher of light.

Canto LXXXVI opens with a passage on the Congress of Vienna and continues to hold up examples of good and bad rulers as defined by the poet with Latin and Chinese phrases from Couvreur woven through them. The word &quot;Sagetrieb&quot;, meaning something like the transmission of tradition, apparently coined by Pound, is repeated after its first use in the previous canto, underlining Pound&#x27;s belief that he is transmitting a tradition of political ethics that unites China, Revolutionary America and his own beliefs.

Canto LXXXVII opens on usury and moves through a number of references to &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; leaders and lawgivers interwoven with neo-platonist philosophers and images of the power of natural process. This culminates in a passage bringing together Binyon&#x27;s dictum &quot;slowness is beauty|golden ratio&quot;, a room in the church of St. Hilaire, Poitiers built to that rule where one can stand without throwing a shadow, Mencius on natural phenomena, the 17th-century English mystic John Heydon (who Pound remembered from his days working with Yeats) and other images relating to the worship of light including &quot;&#x27;MontSegur, sacred to Helios&quot;. The canto then closes with more on economics.

The following canto, Canto LXXXVIII, is almost entirely derived from Benton&#x27;s book and focuses mainly on John Randolph of Roanoke and the campaign against the establishment of the Bank of the United States. Pound viewed the setting up of this bank as a selling out of the principles of economic equity on which the U.S. Constitution was based. At the centre of the canto there is a passage on monopolies that draws on the lives and writings of Thales of Miletus, the emperor Antoninus Pius and St. Ambrose, among others.

Canto LXXXIX continues with Benton and also draws on Alexander del Mar&#x27;s &quot;A History of Money Systems&quot;. The same examples of good rule are drawn on, with the addition of the Emperor Aurelian. Possibly in defence of his focus on so much &quot;unpoetical&quot; material, Pound quotes Rodolphus Agricola to the effect that one writes &quot;to move, to teach or to delight&quot; (&quot;ut moveat, ut doceat, ut delectet&quot;), with the implication that the present cantos are designed to teach. The naturalists Alexander von Humboldt and Louis Agassiz are mentioned in passing.

Apart from a passing reference to Randolph of Roanoke, Canto XC moves to the world of myth and love, both divine and sexual. The canto opens with an epigraph in Latin to the effect that while the human spirit is not love, it delights in the love that proceeds from it. The Latin is paraphrased in English as the final lines of the canto. Following a reference to signatures in nature and Yggdrasil, the poet introduces Baucis and Philemon, an aged couple who, in a story from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, offer hospitality to the gods in their humble house and are rewarded. In this context, they may be intended to represent the poet and his wife.

This canto then moves to the fountain of Castalia on Parnassus. This fountain was sacred to the Muses and its water was said to inspire poetry in those who drank it. The next line, &quot;Templum aedificans not yet marble&quot;, refers to a period when the gods were worshiped in natural settings prior to the rigid codification of religion as represented by the erection of marble temples. The &quot;fount in the hills fold&quot; and the erect temple (&quot;Templum aedificans&quot;) also serve as images of sexual love.

Pound then invokes Amphion, the mythical founder of music, before recalling the San Ku/St Hilaire/Jacques de Molay/Eriugena/Sagetrieb cluster from Canto LXXXVII. Then the goddess appears in a number of guises: the moon, Mother Earth (in the Randolph reference), the Sibyl (last encountered in the context of the American Revolution in Canto LXIV), Isis and Kuanon. In a litany, she is thanked for raising Pound up (&quot;m&#x27;elevasti&quot;, a reference to Dante&#x27;s praise of his beloved Beatrice in the &quot;Paradiso&quot;) out of hell (Erebus).

The canto closes with a number of instances of sexual love between gods and humans set in a paradisiacal vision of the natural world. The invocation of the goddess and the vision of paradise are sandwiched between two citations of Richard of St. Victor&#x27;s statement &quot;ubi amor, ibi oculuc est&quot; (&quot;where love is, there the eye is&quot;), binding together the concepts of love, light and vision in a single image.

Canto XCI continues the paradisiacal theme, opening with a snatch of the &quot;clear song&quot; of Provençe. The central images are the invented figure Ra-Set, a composite sun/moon deity whose boat floats on a river of crystal. The crystal image, which is to remain important until the end of &quot;The Cantos&quot;, is a composite of frozen light, the emphasis on inorganic form found in the writings of the mystic Heydon, the air in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;, and the mirror of crystal in the &quot;Chou King&quot; among other sources. Apollonius of Tyana appears, as do Helen of Tyre, partner of Simon Magus and Justinian and his consort Theodora. These couples can be seen as variants on Ra-Set.

Much of the rest of the canto consists of references to mystic doctrines of light, vision and intellection. There is an extract from a hymn to Diana from Layamon&#x27;s 12th-century poem &quot;Brut&quot;. An italicised section, claiming that the 1913 foundation of the Federal Reserve Bank, which took power over interest rates away from Congress, and the teaching of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud in American universities (&quot;beaneries&quot;) are examples of what Julien Benda termed &quot;La trahison des clercs&quot;, contains anti-Semitic language. Towards the close of the canto, the reader is returned to the world of Odysseus; a line from Book Five of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; tells of the winds breaking up the hero&#x27;s boat and is followed shortly by Leucothea, &quot;Kadamon thugater&quot; or Cadmon&#x27;s daughter) offering him her veil to carry him to shore (&quot;my bikini is worth yr raft&quot;).

An image of the distribution of seeds from the sacred mountain opens Canto XCII, continuing the concern with the relationship between natural process and the divine. The kernel of this canto is the idea that the Roman Empire&#x27;s preference for Christianity over Apollonius and its lack respect for its currency resulted in the almost total loss of the &quot;true&quot; religious tradition for a thousand years. A number of neoplatonic philosophers, familiar from earlier cantos but with the addition of Avicenna, are listed as representing a fine thread of light in these Dark Ages.

Canto XCIII opens with a quote, &quot;A man&#x27;s paradise is his good nature&quot;, taken from &quot;The Maxims of King Kati to His Son Merikara&quot;. The canto then proceeds to look at examples of benevolent action by public figures that, for Pound, illustrate this maxim. These include Apollonius making his peace with animals, Saint Augustine on the need to feed people before attempting to convert them, and Dante and Shakespeare writing on distributive justice, an aspect of their work that the poet points out is generally overlooked. Central to this aspect is a fragment from Dante, &quot;non-fosse cive&quot;, taken from a passage in &quot;Paradiso&quot;, Canto VIII, in which Dante is asked &quot;would it be worse for man on earth if he were not a citizen?&quot; and unhesitatingly answers in the affirmative.

Towards the end of the canto, the &quot;Make it new&quot; ideograms from Canto LIII reappear as the poem moves back towards the world of myth, closing with another phrase from the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, this time from &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, Canto XXVIII. The phrase &quot;tu mi fai rimembrar&quot; translates as &quot;you remind me&quot; and comes from a passage in which Dante addresses Matilda, the presiding spirit of the Garden of Eden. What she reminds him of is Persephone at the moment that she is abducted by Hades and the spring flowers fell from her lap. This blending of a pagan sense of the divine into a Christian context stands for much of what appealed to Pound in medieval mysticism.

We return to the world of books in Canto XCIV. The canto opens with the name of Hendrik van Brederode, a lost leader of the Dutch Revolution, forgotten while William I, Prince of Orange is remembered. This name is lifted from correspondence between John Adams and Benjamin Rush which was finally published in 1898 by Alexander Biddle, a descendant of Pound&#x27;s &quot;villain&quot; Nicholas. The rest of the canto consists mainly of paraphrases and quotations from Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Life of Apollonius&quot;. At its conclusion, the poem returns to the world of light via Ra-Set and Ocellus.

Canto XLV opens with the word &quot;LOVE&quot; in block capitals and recaps many of the &quot;Rock Drill&quot; examples of the relationship between love, light and politics. A passage deriving &quot;polis&quot; from a Greek root word for ploughing also returns us to Pound&#x27;s belief that society and economic activity are based on natural productivity. The canto, and sequence, then closes with an extended treatment of the passage from the fifth book of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in which a drowning Odysseus/Pound is rescued by Leucothea.

==XCVI–CIX (Thrones)==
:First published as &quot;Thrones: 96–109 de los cantares&quot;. New York: New Directions, 1959.

&quot;Thrones&quot; was the second volume of cantos written while Pound was incarcerated in St. Elizabeth&#x27;s. In the same 1962 interview, Pound said of this section of the poem: &quot;The thrones in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot; are for the spirits of the people who have been responsible for good government. The thrones in &quot;The Cantos&quot; are an attempt to move out from egoism and to establish some definition of an order possible or at any rate conceivable on earth … &quot;Thrones&quot; concerns the states of mind of people responsible for something more than their personal conduct.&quot;

The opening canto of the sequence, Canto XCVI, begins with a fragmentary synopsis of the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Byzantine Empire in the east and of the Carolingian Empire, Germanic kingdoms and the Lombards in Western Europe. This culminates in a detailed passage on the &quot;Book of the Prefect&quot; (or Eparch; in Greek the &quot;Eparchikon Biblion&quot;), a 9th-century edict of the Emperor Leo VI the Wise. This document, which was based on Roman law, lays out the rules that governed the Byzantine Guild system, including the setting of just prices and so on. The original Greek is quoted extensively and an aside claiming the right to write for a specialist audience is included. The close attention paid to the actual words prefigures the closer focus on philology in this section of the poem. This focus on words ties in closely with what Pound referred to as the method of &quot;luminous detail&quot;, in which fragments of language intended to form the most compressed expression of an image or idea act as tesserae in the making of these late cantos.

Canto XCVII draws heavily on Alexander del Mar&#x27;s &quot;History of Monetary Systems&quot; in a survey ranging from Abd al Melik, the first Caliph to strike distinctly Islamic coinage, through Athelstan, who helped introduce the guild system into England, to the American Revolution. The canto closes with a passage that sees the return of the goddess as moon and Fortuna together with Greek forms of solar worship and the Flamen Dialis that is intended to integrate gold and silver as attributes of coin and the divine.

After an opening passage that draws together many of the main themes of the poem through images of Ra-Set, Ocellus on light (echoing Eriugena), the tale of &quot;Gassire&#x27;s Lute&quot;, Leucothoe&#x27;s rescue of Odysseus, Helen of Troy, Gemisto, Demeter, and Plotinus, Canto XCVIII turns to the &quot;Sacred Edict&quot; of the emperor K&#x27;ang Hsi. This is a 17th-century set of maxims on good government written in a high literary style, but later simplified for a broader audience. Pound draws on one such popular version, by Wang the Commissioner of the Imperial Salt Works in a translation by F.W. Baller. Comparison is drawn between this Chinese text and the &quot;Book of the Prefect&quot;, and the canto closes with images of light as divine creation drawn from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

K&#x27;ang Hsi&#x27;s son Iong Cheng published commentaries on his father&#x27;s maxims and these form the basis for Canto XCIX. The main theme of this canto is one of harmony between human society and the natural order, and a number of passing references are made to related items from earlier cantos: Confucius, Kati, Dante on citizenship, the &quot;Book of the Prefect&quot; and Plotinus amongst them. Canto C covers a range of examples of European and American statesman who Pound sees as exemplifying the maxims of the &quot;Sacred Edict&quot; to a greater or lesser extent. At the core of this canto, the motif of Luecothoe&#x27;s veil (&quot;kredemnon&quot;) resurfaces; this time, the hero has reached the safety of the shore and returns the magic garment to the goddess.

The focus of Canto CI is around the Greek phrase &quot;kalon kagathon&quot; (&quot;the beautiful and good&quot;), which calls to mind Plotinus&#x27; attitude to the world of things and the more general Greek belief in the moral aspect of beauty. This canto introduces the figure of St. Anselm of Canterbury, who is to feature over the rest of this section of the long poem. Canto CII returns to the island of Calypso and Odysseus&#x27; voyage to Hades from Book Ten of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. There are a number of references to vegetation cults and sacrifices, and the canto closes by returning to the world of Byzantium and the decline of the Western Empire.

Cantos CIII and CIV range over a number of examples of the relationships between war, money and government drawn from American and European history, mostly familiar from earlier sections of the work. The latter canto is notable for Pound&#x27;s suggestion that both Honoré Mirabeau in his imprisonment and Ovid in his exile &quot;had it worse&quot; than Pound in his incarceration.

At the core of Canto CV are a number of citations and quotations from the writings of St. Anselm. This 11th-century philosopher and inventor of the ontological argument for the existence of God who wrote poems in rhymed prose appealed to Pound because of his emphasis on the role of reason in religion and his envisioning of the divine essence as light. In the 1962 interview already quoted, Pound points to Anselm&#x27;s clash with William Rufus over his investiture as part of the history of the struggle for individual rights. Pound also claims in this canto that Anselm&#x27;s writings influenced Cavalcanti and François Villon.

Canto CVI turns to visions of the goddess as fertility symbol via Demeter and Persephone, in her lunar, love aspect as Selena, Helen and Aphrodite Euploia (&quot;of safe voyages&quot;) and as hunter Athene (Proneia: &quot;of forethought,&quot; the form in which she is worshiped at Delphi) and Diana (through quotes from Layamon). The sun as Zeus/Helios also features. These vision fragments are cross-cut with an invocation of the Taoist &quot;Kuan Tzu&quot; (&quot;Book of Master Kuan&quot;). This work argues that the mind should rule the body as the basis of good living and good governance.

Another such figure, Sir Edward Coke, dominates the final three cantos of this section. These cantos, CVII, CVIII, CIX, consist mainly of &quot;luminous details&quot; lifted from Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot;, a comprehensive study of English law up to his own time. In Canto CVII, Coke is placed in a &quot;river of light&quot; tradition that also includes Confucius, Ocellus and Agassiz. This canto also refers to Dante&#x27;s vision of philosophers that reveal themselves as light in the &quot;Paradiso&quot;. In Canto CVIII, Pound highlights Coke&#x27;s view that minting coin &quot;Pertain(s) to the King onely&quot; and has passages on sources of state revenue. He also draws a comparison between Coke and Iong Cheng. A similar parallel between Coke and the author of the &quot;Book of the Eparch&quot; is highlighted in Canto CIX.

The canto and section end with a reference to the following lines from the second canto of the &quot;Paradiso&quot;—

:O voi che siete in piccioletta barca,
:desiderosi d’ascoltar, seguiti
:dietro al mio legno che cantando varca,

:tornate a riveder li vostri liti:
:non vi mettete in pelago, ché forse,
:perdendo me, rimarreste smarriti.

—which read, in the translation by Charles Eliot Norton, &quot;O ye, who are in a little bark, desirous to listen, following behind my craft which singing passes on, turn to see again Your shores; put not out upon the deep; for haply losing me, ye would remain astray.&quot; This reference signalled Pound&#x27;s intent to close the poem with a final volume based on his own paradisiacal vision.

==Drafts and fragments of Cantos CX–CXVII==
:First published as &quot;Drafts and Fragments of Cantos CX–CXVII.&quot; New York: New Directions, 1969.

In 1958, Pound was declared incurably insane and permanently incapable of standing trial. Consequent on this, he was released from St Elizabeth&#x27;s on condition that he return to Europe, which he promptly did. At first, he lived with his daughter Mary in the Tyrol, but soon returned to Rapallo. In November 1959, Pound wrote to his publisher James Laughlin (speaking in the third person) that he &quot;has forgotten what or which politics he ever had. Certainly has none now&quot;. His crisis of belief, together with the effects of aging, meant that the proposed paradise cantos were slow in coming and turned out to be radically different from anything the poet had envisaged.
Pound was reluctant to publish these late cantos, but the appearance in 1967 of a pirate edition of &quot;Cantos 110–116&quot; forced his hand. Laughlin pushed Pound to publish an authorised edition, and the poet responded by supplying the more-or-less abandoned drafts and fragments he had, plus two fragments dating from 1941. The resulting book, therefore, can hardly be described as representing Pound&#x27;s definitive planned ending to the poem. This situation has been further complicated by the addition of more fragments in editions of the complete poem published after the poet&#x27;s death. One of these was labelled &quot;Canto CXX&quot; at one point, on no particular authority. This title was later removed.

Although some of Pound&#x27;s intention to &quot;write a paradise&quot; survives in the text as we have it, especially in images of light and of the natural world, other themes also intrude. These include the poet&#x27;s coming to terms with a sense of artistic failure, and jealousies and hatreds that must be faced and expiated.

Canto CX opens with a pun on the word &quot;wake&quot;, conflating the wake of the little boat from the end of the previous canto and an image of Pound waking in his daughter&#x27;s house in the Tyrol, both from sleep and, by extension, from the nightmare of his prolonged incarceration. The goddess appears as Kuanon, Artemis and Hebe (through her characteristic epithet &quot;Kallistragalos&quot;, &quot;of fair ankles&quot;), the goddess of youth. The Buddhist painter Toba Sojo represents directness of artistic handling.

The Noh figure of Awoi (from &quot;AOI NO UE&quot;), ravaged by jealousy, reappears together with the poet Ono no Komachi, the central character in two more Noh plays translated by Pound. She represents a life spent meditating on beauty which resulted in vanity and ended in loss and solitude. The canto draws to a close with the phrase &quot;Lux enim&quot; (&quot;light indeed&quot;) and an image of the oval moon.

Pound&#x27;s &quot;nice, quiet paradise&quot; is seen, in the notes for Canto CXI, to be based on serenity, pity, intelligence and individual acceptance of responsibility as illustrated by the French diplomat Talleyrand. This theme is continued in the short extract titled from Canto CXII, which also draws on the work of the anthropologist and explorer Joseph F. Rock in recording legends and religious rituals from China and Tibet. Again, this section of the poem closes with an image of the moon.

Canto CXIII opens with an image of the sun moving through the zodiac, the first of a number of cycle images that occur through the canto, recalling a line from Pound&#x27;s version of &quot;AOI NO UE&quot;: &quot;Man&#x27;s life is a wheel on the axle, there is no turn whereby to escape&quot;. A reference to Marcella Spann, a young woman whose presence in the Tyrol further complicated the already strained relationships between the poet, his wife Dorothy and his lover Olga Rudge, casts further light on the recurrent jealousy theme. The phrase &quot;Syrian onyx&quot; lifted from his 1919 &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot;, where it occurs in a section that paraphrases Propertius&#x27; instructions to his lover on how to behave after his death, reflects the elderly Pound&#x27;s sense of his own mortality.

The theme of hatred is addressed directly at the opening of Canto CXIV, where Voltaire is quoted to the effect that he hates nobody, not even his archenemy Elie Fréron. The remainder of this canto is primarily concerned with recognising indebtedness to the poet&#x27;s genetic and cultural ancestors. The short extract from Canto CXV is a reworking from an earlier version first published in the Belfast-based magazine &quot;Threshold&quot; in 1962 and centres around two main ideas. The first of these is the hostilities that existed among Pound&#x27;s modernist friends and the negative impact that it had on all their works. The second is the image of the poet as a &quot;blown husk&quot;, again a borrowing from the Noh, this time the play &quot;Kakitsubata&quot;.

Canto CXVI was the last canto completed by Pound. It opens with a passage in which we see the Odysseus/Pound figure, homecoming achieved, reconciled with the sea-god. However, the home achieved is not the place intended when the poem was begun but is the &quot;terzo cielo&quot; (&quot;third heaven&quot;) of human love. The canto contains the following well-known lines:

:I have brought the great ball of crystal;
:::Who can lift it?
:Can you enter the great acorn of light?
:But the beauty is not the madness
:Tho&#x27; my errors and wrecks lie about me.
:And I am not a demigod,
:I cannot make it cohere.

This passage has often been taken as an admission of failure on Pound&#x27;s part, but the reality may be more complex. The crystal image relates back to the &quot;Sacred Edict&quot; on self-knowledge and the demigod/cohere lines relate directly to Pound&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Women of Trachis&quot;. In this, the demigod Herakles cries out &quot;WHAT SPLENDOUR / IT ALL COHERES&quot; as he is dying. These lines, read in conjunction with the later &quot;i.e. it coheres all right / even if my notes do not cohere&quot;, point toward the conclusion that towards the end of his effort, Pound was coming to accept not only his own &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;madness&quot; but the conclusion that it was beyond him, and possibly beyond poetry, to do justice to the coherence of the universe. Images of light saturate this canto, culminating in the closing lines: &quot;A little light, like a rushlight / to lead back to splendour&quot;. These lines again echo the Noh of &quot;Kakitsubata&quot;, the &quot;light that does not lead on to darkness&quot; in Pound&#x27;s version.

This final complete canto is followed by the two fragments of the 1940s. The first of these, &quot;Addendum for C&quot;, is a rant against usury that moves a bit away from the usual anti-Semitism in the line &quot;the defiler, beyond race and against race&quot;. The second is an untitled fragment that prefigures the Pisan sequence in its nature imagery and its reference to Jannequin.

Notes for Canto CXVII &quot;et seq.&quot; originally consisted of three fragments, with a fourth, sometimes titled Canto CXX, added after Pound&#x27;s death. The first of these has the poet raising an altar to Bacchus (Zagreus) and his mother Semele, whose death was as a result of jealousy. The second centres on the lines &quot;that I lost my center / fighting the world&quot;, which were intended as an admission of mistakes made as a younger man. The third fragment is the one that is also known as Canto CXX. It is, in fact, some rescued lines from the earlier version of Canto CXV, and has Pound asking forgiveness for his actions from both the gods and those he loves. The final fragment returns to beginnings with the name of François Bernonad, the French printer of &quot;A Draft of XVI Cantos&quot;. After quoting two phrases from Bernart de Ventadorn&#x27;s &quot;Can vei la lauzeta mover&quot;, a poem in which the speaker determines to abandon love because he has been rejected, the fragment closes with the line &quot;To be men, not destroyers.&quot; This stood as the close of &quot;The Cantos&quot; until later editions appended the two Italian cantos LXXII and LXXIII and a brief dedicatory fragment addressed to Olga Rudge.

==Controversy==
&quot;The Cantos&quot; has always been controversial; initially so because of the experimental nature of the writing. The controversy has intensified since 1940 when Pound&#x27;s public approval for Mussolini&#x27;s fascism became widely known. Much critical discussion of the poem has focused on the relationship between, on the one hand, the economic thesis on &quot;usura&quot;, Pound&#x27;s anti-Semitism, his adulation of Confucian ideals of government and his attitude towards fascism, and, on the other, passages of lyrical poetry and the historical scene-setting that he performed with his &quot;ideographic&quot; technique. At one extreme, George P. Elliot has drawn a parallel between Pound and Adolf Eichmann based on their anti-Semitism while at the other Marjorie Perloff places Pound&#x27;s anti-Semitism in a wider context by relating it to the political attitudes of many of his contemporaries, and says, &quot;We have to try to understand why and not say let&#x27;s get rid of Ezra Pound, who also happens to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th C.&quot; In another exercise in contextualisation, Wendy Stallard Flory (1939) made a close study of the poem and concluded that it contains, in all, seven passages of anti-Semitic sentiment in the 803 pages of the edition she used.

Pound has always had serious if select defenders and disciples. Louis Zukofsky was both of these, and also Jewish; according to Cookson he defended Pound on the basis of personal knowledge from anti-Semitism on the level of human exchange, even though, as reported by Basil Bunting, their correspondence contained some of Pound&#x27;s &quot;offensive&quot; views. What is more, Zukofsky&#x27;s similarly formidable but distinctive long poem &quot;A&quot; follows in its ambitious scope the model of &quot;The Cantos&quot;.

==Legacy==
Despite all the controversy surrounding both poem and poet, &quot;The Cantos&quot; has been influential in the development of English-language long poems since the appearance of the early sections during the 1920s. Among poets of Pound&#x27;s own generation, both H.D. and William Carlos Williams wrote long poems that show this influence. Almost all of H.D.&#x27;s poetry from 1940 onwards takes the form of long sequences, and her &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot;, written during the 1950s, covers much of the same Homeric ground as &quot;The Cantos&quot; (but from a feminist perspective), and the three sequences that make up &quot;Hermetic Definition&quot; (1972) include direct quotations from Pound&#x27;s poem. In the case of Williams, his &quot;Paterson&quot; (1963) follows Pound in using incidents and documents from the early history of the United States as part of its material. As with Pound, Williams includes Alexander Hamilton as the villain of the piece.

Pound was a major influence on the Objectivist poets, and the effect of &quot;The Cantos&quot; on Zukofsky&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; has already been noted. The other major long work by an Objectivist, Charles Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot; (1934–1978), follows Pound in the direct use of primary source documents as its raw material. In the next generation of American poets, Charles Olson also drew on Pound&#x27;s example in writing his own unfinished Modernist epic, &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;.

Pound was also an important figure for the poets of the Beat Generation, especially Snyder and Allen Ginsberg. Snyder&#x27;s interest in things Chinese and Japanese stemmed from his early reading of Pound&#x27;s writings, and his long poem &quot;Mountains and Rivers Without End&quot; (1965–1996) reflects his reading of &quot;The Cantos&quot; in many of the formal devices used. In Ginsberg&#x27;s development, reading Pound was influential in his move away from the long, Whitmanesque lines of his early poetry, and towards the more varied metric and inclusive approach to a variety of subjects in the single poem that is to be found especially in his book-length sequences &quot;Planet News&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Fall of America: Poems of These States&quot; (1973). More generally, &quot;The Cantos&quot;, with its wide range of references and inclusion of primary sources, including prose texts, can be seen as prefiguring found poetry. Pound&#x27;s tacit insistence that this material becomes poetry because of his action in including it in a text he chose to call a poem also prefigures the attitudes and practices that underlie 20th-century Conceptual art.

The poetic response to &quot;The Cantos&quot; is summed up in Bunting&#x27;s poem, &quot;On the Fly-Leaf of Pound&#x27;s Cantos&quot;:
:There are the Alps. What is there to say about them?
:They don&#x27;t make sense. Fatal glaciers, crags cranks climb,
:jumbled boulder and weed, pasture and boulder, scree,
:et l&#x27;on entend, maybe, le refrain joyeux et leger.
:Who knows what the ice will have scraped on the rock it is smoothing?

:There they are, you will have to go a long way round
:if you want to avoid them.
:It takes some getting used to. There are the Alps,
:fools! Sit down and wait for them to crumble!

<text>14 Iced Bears are a British indie pop band associated with the C86 music scene. Formed in Brighton in 1985, by Robert Sekula and Nick Emery the band featured a shifting line-up of musicians across their seven-year existence, centred on songwriter and vocalist Rob Sekula and guitarist/songwriter Kevin Canham. Their jangly indie pop was characterised by a fuzzy protopunk-influenced guitar sound, and saw them receive modest critical acclaim in Britain&#x27;s music press as well as prompting disc jockey John Peel to recruit them to record a couple of sessions for his programme on BBC radio. The group released a handful of singles, including &quot;Come Get Me&quot; on the influential Sarah label, and two full-length albums: the eponymous &quot;14 Iced Bears&quot; (1988), and &quot;Wonder&quot; (1991).

They reformed in 2010 and toured the US east coast, the US west coast in 2011, as well as some concerts in London, including a John Peel night with Vic Godard, Viv Albertine and the TV Personalities. Robert Sekula announced from the stage of Indietracks Festival 2012 on 7 July that their set had been their first at an outdoor festival. In July 2013, they released a 2-CD retrospective of their total output &quot;Hold on Inside&quot; on Cherry Red Records. The month previously, their track &quot;Balloon Song&quot; was included in the comprehensive 1980s indie compilation CD &quot;Scared to Get Happy&quot;, which featured bands such as The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Jesus and Mary Chain (Cherry Red Records).

Robert Sekula released a solo single &quot;Not Santa Claus&quot; in December 2019.

==Influence==
In 2003, 14 Iced Bears were mentioned in the song &quot;Twee&quot; by Tullycraft, and &quot;The Balloon Song&quot; was recorded by The Aislers Set for their 2001 album, &quot;The Last Match&quot;.

<text>Seumas McNally (February 10, 1979 – March 21, 2000) was a Canadian video game programmer and designer. He is best known for his development of indie games and computer software, including &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; and &quot;Tread Marks&quot;, the latter earning him the Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival (IGF) in 2000. The same award was posthumously renamed in his honour the following year, subsequent to his death after a three-year long battle against Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

== Career ==
McNally&#x27;s first published video game was a side-scrolling helicopter shooter titled &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Bane&quot;, programmed on the Amiga. Previously known as a demo by the name &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, the game went live on November 11, 1997, published through Aminet. The same year, Seumas formed the software development company Longbow Digital Arts (also known as Longbow Games), working together with his father, Jim McNally (game designer), his mother, Wendy McNally (lead artist) and his brother, Philippe McNally (3D artist). The company released &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; in 1998, a sequel to the 1996 cult-classic PC game &quot;DX-Ball&quot; by Michael P. Welch, while simultaneously working on the 3D terrain tank-racing game &quot;Tread Marks&quot;, which was released in 2000. While &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; had accumulated more than 5 million downloads by the end of 2002, &quot;Tread Marks&quot; won three Independent Games Festival Awards for &quot;Best Game&quot;, &quot;Best Design&quot; and &quot;Best Programming&quot;. Other products McNally programmed include &quot;Particle Fire&quot;, a screensaver exhibiting a fiery display of flexuously moving particles; &quot;Texturizer&quot;, for creating seamless textures; and &quot;WebProcessor&quot;, for creating fast HTML macros.

=== &quot;DX-Ball&quot; ===
McNally is credited for visual contribution to the original &quot;DX-Ball&quot; by Michael P. Welch (creator of &quot;Pocket Tanks&quot;), a freeware computer game for the PC first released in 1996. The game, originally based on an earlier series of Amiga games known as &quot;MegaBall&quot;, is patterned after classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Arkanoid&quot;. &quot;DX-Ball&quot; has been succeeded by four follow-ups: &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; (1998), &quot;Rival Ball&quot; (2001), &quot;Super DX-Ball&quot; (2004) and &quot;DX-Ball 2: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2018).

=== &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; ===
Developed by Longbow Digital Arts as a derivation of the original DX-Ball, &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot; introduced the feature of board-set selection, allowing the player to pick between various sets of boards to play. The free demo came packed with a total of 24 boards divided into 6 board-sets of 4 boards each. Additional board packs could then be purchased and installed for more boards, whereas the initial Board Pack 1 expansion would extend the demo board-sets into full sets of 25 boards each, summing a total of 150 boards. While a total of five board packs were released for the game, &quot;DX-Ball&quot; 2 was later succeeded by &quot;Rival Ball&quot; in 2001.

== Illness and death ==
McNally was diagnosed in 1997 with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, at the age of 18. McNally died on March 21, 2000, shortly after winning the grand prize for &quot;Tread Marks&quot;.

== Legacy ==
McNally&#x27;s family continued to operate Longbow Digital Arts following his death, primarily focusing on casual games. The company later announced the development of a historical wargame in 2005, the basic design drafts of which McNally&#x27;s father had helped to formulate. It was released in 2010 as &quot;Hegemony: Philip of Macedon&quot; and became the first entry in a series of historical wargames. Longbow Games&#x27; product catalogue has since expanded with the additions of &quot;Golem&quot;, a 3D puzzle-adventure game, and a &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; of &quot;DX-Ball 2&quot;, which were both released in 2018.

<text>Tread Marks is a 3D, third-person perspective, multiplayer-focused tank combat and racing computer game developed by Independent video game developer Longbow Digital Arts. The game won the 2000 Independent Games Festival grand prize, later renamed to the Seumas McNally Grand Prize in honor of the game&#x27;s lead programmer Seumas McNally who died on 21 March 2000, after receiving the award. A notable feature of the game is fully deformable terrain.

==Gameplay==
The tanks come in two varieties: steel and liquid. The steel tanks resemble real-life tanks, while the liquid types are whimsical fantasy tanks. Weapons and power-ups are scattered around the maps, and range in destructive power from light machine guns to tactical nuclear missiles.
The game features three gameplay modes:
* Race mode, in which tanks must race around an off-road course while attempting to stop other tanks from completing the course. Common techniques include using the in-game weapons to attack opponents and using physical tank contact to temporarily &#x27;push&#x27; opponents off the course.
* Battle mode (deathmatch, or DM), in which the tank or team with the most kills win as soon as the global kill or time limit is reached.
* Capture the Flag mode (CTF) in which there are two or more teams of tanks that compete by trying to capture one of the other team&#x27;s flags.

The race and battle modes can be played in either team or single-player mode. &quot;Tread Marks&quot; can be played over a LAN, or over the Internet and includes a program for running a dedicated game server, which lists the computer it runs from on the master server. The master server in turn is operated by Longbow Digital Arts from a location in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Many modifications can be found online, including new maps, tanks, and weapons.

==History==
===Development===
The game was developed by Seumas McNally and uses OpenGL to render its 3D graphics and the Miles Sound System for positional sound. A notable feature is the in-game deformable terrain which doesn&#x27;t harm performance. For instance, a nuclear missile explosion creates a huge black crater in the terrain, while its &quot;opposite&quot;, the &quot;Matterbomb&quot;, creates a huge mountain on the terrain. For the in-game deformable terrain a Binary-Triangle Tree-based dynamic view dependent level of detail height field renderer was utilized.

===Open Sourcing===
On January 20, 2017 the game was released as freeware and the source code as open-source under the GPLv3 license on GitHub. For enhanced cross platform portability, the Miles Sound System was replaced with OpenAL, and the platform dependent Win32 API code with SFML and Qt. A port to Linux and MacOS is in progress. In September 2017 a version for the Linux-based OpenPandora was released.

==Reception==
At the time of release, the game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

<text>Frescolita is a Venezuelan cola. It is very similar to red cream sodas in the United States, with a taste similar to gum. Frescolita is also used to bake in some places in Venezuela. It is marketed by The Coca-Cola Company. Its ingredients include carbonated water, sugar, sodium benzoate, citric acid, artificial color flavor. Besides Venezuela, it is available in stores that specialize in Latin American groceries in the United States and Europe.

While Coca-Cola is consumed more, it has been reported that Frescolita takes more of the general soft-drinks market of the country. Up to 45% of Coca-Cola&#x27;s sales of soft drinks in Venezuela is in Hit, &quot;Frescolita&quot; and Chinotto.

<text>The Regional Theatre Tony Award is a special recognition Tony Award given annually to a regional theater company in the United States. The winner is recommended by a committee of drama critics.

==Background==
Initially presented in 1948 to Robert Porterfield of the Virginia Barter Theatre for their &quot;Contribution To Development Of Regional Theatre&quot;, the Regional Theatre awards were next presented starting in 1976. The award is &quot;based on a recommendation by the American Theatre Critics Association&quot;, and includes a grant of $25,000. As the American Theatre Critics Association has noted, no theater has won the award more than once, &quot;testifying to the growing strength of professional theater nationwide.&quot; One of the objects of the award is promoting what often amounts to the incubators of new productions.

In June 2013, the Tony Awards Administration Committee stated that effective with the 2013-14 season, &quot;New York-based theatre companies will be eligible to receive the Regional Theatre Award.&quot; The Broadway League and American Theatre Wing, in a joint statement, explained: &quot;New York has some of the most prestigious and creative theatre groups in the country and we are thrilled to include the New York theatre community in this category.&quot;

<doc id="1176460" wikidata="Q267607" url="?curid=1176460" title="François Faber">
<text>François Faber (; 26 January 1887 – 9 May 1915) was a Luxembourgish racing cyclist. He was born in France. He was the first foreigner to win the Tour de France in 1909, and his record of winning 5 consecutive stages still stands. He died in World War I while fighting for France. Faber was known for his long solos; he is the only rider in Tour de France history to lead solo more than 1000 km.

==Origins==
Faber&#x27;s father, Jean-François, was born in Wiltz, Luxembourg, which gave his son Luxembourgish nationality. His mother, Marie-Paule, was born in Lorraine. François Faber had a Luxembourgish passport but lived in France and considered himself French. His half-brother was another cyclist, Ernest Paul.

Faber worked as a furniture-remover and as a docker when he raced as an amateur.

==Racing career==
Faber was a professional from 1906 to 1914. He won 27 races. His size— and —and his suburb of Paris gave him the nickname &quot;The Giant of Colombes&quot;. He rode for Labor in 1906 and 1907, moved to Peugeot in 1908, then Alcyon from 1909 to 1911. He joined Automoto for 1912 before returning to Peugeot in 1913 and 1914.

He rode the Tour de France for the first time in 1906 but didn&#x27;t finish and the next year, he came seventh. In 1908 as part of the all-conquering Peugeot team, he finished second, winning four stages.

He dominated the 1909 Tour de France, winning five consecutive stages, which is still a record. The 1909 Tour had the worst weather the race had seen. Fifty riders dropped out in six days when rain, snow, thick mud, frost and deeply rutted, unsurfaced roads dogged the race from 7 to 13 July. The worse things got, the better Faber rode. He led the race alone for 200 km to win the 398 km stage from Roubaix to Metz on the second day.

The third day started at three degrees above freezing and the weather became even worse. The race set off for Belfort and again Faber broke clear going over the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace and, after leading alone for 110 km, he finished covered in mud with his main challenger, Gustave Garrigou, 33 minutes behind.

Still the weather got worse as the next stage left at 2am to ride to Lyon. Faber&#x27;s riding attracted a crowd of 3,000 to see him leave and what was said to be 20,000 to see him finish. He won again after riding the last 62 km alone after a day of potholes and knee-high water. He climbed the Col de Porte in a wind that twice blew him off his bike and being knocked down by a horse. His chain broke on the approach to Lyon and he ran a kilometre to the finish, pushing his bike. He won all five stages from Metz to Nice, all of them by himself, the final one after attacking Garrigou when he stopped due to a puncture.

At the end of the race, the race official, Alphonse Steinès, asked Faber what he planned to do next. Faber said: 

Lucien Petit-Breton said of him:
In the 1910 Tour, Faber was leading his Alcyon teammate Octave Lapize in the overall general classification when in Stage 7, a collision with a dog at the foot of the Pyrenees left him seriously injured. Despite winning the stage at Nîmes, the injury cost him the tour. Lapize attacked and took the tour with a last gasp attack from Faber on the final stage from Caen to Paris ending with a number of punctures.

He continued to compete in the Tour de France with moderate success until his cycling career, like many of his peers, was curtailed with the start of World War I.

Faber won 19 Tour de France stages, Paris–Brussels, Bordeaux–Paris, Sedan-Brussels, Paris–Tours twice, Paris–Roubaix and the Giro di Lombardia.

==Death==
Faber joined the French Foreign Legion when the First World War broke out. He was assigned to the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment, at Bayonne on 22 August 1914. He was promoted to corporal. On 9 May 1915, the first day of the Battle of Artois at Carency near Arras he received a telegram saying his wife had given birth to a daughter. One story says that, cheering, he jumped out of the trench and was killed by a German bullet. Another, more commonly accepted, is that he was shot while carrying an injured colleague back from no-man&#x27;s land during fighting between Carency and Mont-Saint-Éloi. His regiment lost 1,950 of 2,900 in their attack. Faber was posthumously awarded the Médaille militaire.

The GP François Faber, a small race in Luxembourg, is named after him.

There is a plaque in his memory in the church of Notre Dame de Lorette in the French national war cemetery near Arras.

On 28 March 2015, a new plaque in his memory was unveiled in Mont-Saint-Éloi, close to where he died. It was unveiled by Faber&#x27;s grandson, Jacques Pallut and the town&#x27;s mayor, Jean-Pierre Bavière.

<text>Robert Goldsborough (December 3, 1733 – December 22, 1788) was an American lawyer and statesman from Maryland. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

==Early life==
Robert Goldsborough was the son of Elizabeth (née Ennalls) and Charles Goldsborough. and was born on the family estate &quot;(Horns Point)&quot; at Cambridge in Dorchester County, Province of Maryland on December 3, 1733. His father owned over 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land, and became a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council in 1760. As a young man Robert travelled to London to study law at the Middle Temple and graduated in December 1752, where he was admitted to the bar in February 1757. He remained there practicing law as a Barrister until 1759 when he returned to America. He attended the Philadelphia College &quot;(now the University of Pennsylvania)&quot;, and graduated in 1760 before resuming the practice of law in Cambridge, Maryland.

==Personal life==
Goldsborough married Sarah Yerbury on March 27, 1755, in England. He had eleven children: Charles, Charles, John, Robert, William, Richard, Howes, Rebecca, Sarah, Elizabeth and Rachel. His son, Robert Henry Goldsborough, would also become a senator in Maryland.

==Career==
Goldsborough was the sheriff of Dorchester County from 1761 to 1764. He began his service in the Maryland Assembly in 1765, and served as the colony&#x27;s Attorney General from 1766 to 1768. He became active in the protests that led to the American Revolution, joining Maryland&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Safety&quot;. In 1774 he was sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he served until May 1776. Later that year he attended the Convention that drafted Maryland&#x27;s first state constitution. Under the new state constitution, he was elected to the first Maryland Senate in 1777.

Robert narrowly missed two chances to be listed formally as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He withdrew from the Continental Congress six weeks before the Declaration of Independence to return home and work towards Maryland&#x27;s first constitution. In 1787, he was selected as a representative to attend the U.S. Constitutional Convention, but didn&#x27;t attend due to poor health. He died the following year at home at Horns Point, and is buried in the Christ Episcopal Church Cemetery in Cambridge, Maryland.

He was elected posthumously to the American Philosophical Society in 1791.

==Death==
Goldsborough died on December 22, 1788, in Dorchester County. He was buried at Cambridge Court in Dorchester County.

<doc id="1176482" wikidata="Q5533049" url="?curid=1176482" title="Pulpit gown">
<text>The pulpit gown, also called pulpit robe or preaching robe, is a black gown worn by Protestant ministers for preaching. It is particularly associated with Reformed churches, while also used in the Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, Baptist, and Unitarian traditions.

It is commonly called the Geneva gown, especially in Reformed churches. The garment in Lutheran churches is the talar (&quot;talaris vestis&quot;), also called &quot;priesterrock&quot; (priest&#x27;s robe) or &quot;chorrock&quot; (choir or chancel robe).

== Description ==
The gown, like academic and judicial gowns, is traditionally black, loose fitting with full length bell sleeves. It is often constructed from heavy material and features velvet facings running over the neck and down the front, mimicking the tippet or stole sometimes worn over it. In the US and other countries where this forms a part of doctoral gowns, a minister who has earned a doctorate (e.g. DD, ThD, PhD) may wear three velvet bars on each sleeve, or simply wear his academic gown in the pulpit. The velvet panels of the gown&#x27;s facings match the sleeves.

Contemporary choir robes are distinct from the Geneva gown, usually made with lighter and colorful fabrics and large open sleeves.

=== Purpose ===
The Geneva gown represents the academic training the wearer has attained for the purpose of preaching. The gown has the effect of concealing the person, thereby emphasizing the office instead. In this way, it is a kind of uniform.

=== Accompanying garments ===
Modern gowns are often worn over a collared shirt with necktie or a clerical collar, with or without a suitcoat. A minister may also wear preaching bands and a stole. A lay preacher may wear a preaching scarf. Less typically a minister may wear white gloves when distributing elements of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, a practice predating the advent of stainless steel chalices and communion trays. Open-front gowns are traditionally worn over the cassock and sometimes do not include sleeves, especially in Britain where Master&#x27;s gowns sometimes feature drop sleeves (also called a set-in sleeve).

== History ==

The Protestant Reformers objected to the theology of ordination in Roman Catholic Church and its prescribed priestly vestments. Andreas Karlstadt was the first to wear his black academic gown during the liturgy rather than contemporary clerical dress. Other Protestant ministers, (esp. Reformed), many of them former Catholic priests, followed suit. Unlike today, when academic regalia is generally reserved for ceremonies, this would have been the daily dress for the reformers. John Knox carried the custom from Geneva to Scotland in the 1570s. This was eventually defined as liturgical dress, and the traditional garment for those in leadership roles.

In the Church of England, a controversy broke out over the prescription of vestments in the first Book of Common Prayer. The more reformed (later, Puritan) party preferred black gowns like their continental reformed peers, and objected that such vestments were a superstitious holdover from medieval Catholicism. The debate centered around whether vestments were a thing indifferent and could thus be regulated. Official positions would fluctuate through the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I. By 1610 James VI and I instructed black gowns for the pulpit.

== Usage ==

By convention a minister or lay preacher only wears the gown for services in which they deliver a sermon, though it was originally a minister&#x27;s daily wear in the reformation era.

A survey from 1966 records North American use by denomination. In all cases, the denomination allows for local discretion or makes no official statement:

For historical and theological reasons the gown is most typical of Congregational, Presbyterian and Reformed churches, that is those congregations primarily influenced by Calvinist formulations of Christian doctrine and church order. Though historically also common with Baptist and Methodist clergy, its use waned in the 20th century. During that century, there was a general shift toward a less formal religious service; this movement spread across most denominational lines. Rarely is this uniquely Protestant attire worn by Eastern Orthodox or Roman Catholics.

=== Anglican ===

The typical clerical dress of an Anglican minister during the 18th century was a cassock, Geneva gown, and neck bands. For this reason, the gown is sometimes (though rarely) found in &quot;low church&quot; parishes of the Anglican Communion, many whom desire a continuity with the stauncher Protestant stances of the church before the influence of the Oxford Movement. In these parishes it is usual for the gown to be worn for preaching, whilst the surplice is worn for the liturgy.

=== Black American ===

Gowns are widely used in many African-American congregations regardless of denominational affiliation.

=== Lutheran ===

Use of the gown has also waned in Lutheran churches, though it seemed to be common during the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries.

=== Reformed and Presbyterian ===
In the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, it is normal for the Geneva gown to be vented (opened at the front), sleeveless, and worn over a cassock. The cassock is usually black, but also comes in blue (as the Flag of Scotland), or scarlet red for a King&#x27;s Chaplain. This practice is sometimes followed by some English Methodists and American Presbyterians, although wearing the more familiar American-style gown, including wearing a black cassock in Roman or Anglican cut.

=== Non-Christian ===
Some rabbis and spiritual leaders of other non-Christian faiths have fashioned their modern religious garb patterned after the historic Geneva gown.

== Trends ==
The gown gained in popularity in the 20th century, but so did the alb after Vatican II (1962–65). Ministers abandoning the gown will generally transition to an alb with accompanying cincture, stole or chasuble, or abandon distinctive dress altogether, often wearing a typical business suit.

=== Transition to alb ===

The Oxford movement, paleo-orthodox and uniting church movements are all associated with a renewed interest in premodern liturgical forms. These tend to abandon the Geneva gown for the alb and cincture, which are seen as more ancient and ecumenical.

German Protestant churches have officially reintroduced liturgical vestments since the 1970s, a trend termed &quot;reclericalisation&quot;.

=== Transition to civilian clothing ===

Evangelical and Pentecostal churches trend the opposite direction, doing away with distinct ministerial dress altogether. This has the effect of minimizing distinction between pastor and laity, encouraging a casual atmosphere common for the seeker sensitive movement.

<doc id="1176486" wikidata="Q1474387" url="?curid=1176486" title="Mondo film">
<text>Mondo film is a subgenre of exploitative documentary films. Many mondo films are made in a way to resemble a pseudo-documentary and usually depicting sensational topics, scenes, or situations. Common traits of &quot;mondo films&quot; include portrayals of foreign cultures (which have drawn accusations of ethnocentrism or racism), an emphasis on taboo subjects such as death and sex, and staged sequences presented as genuine documentary footage. Over time, the films have placed increasing emphasis on footage of the dead and dying (both real and fake).

The term is Italian for . The term shockumentary is also used to describe the genre.

Mondo films began to soar in popularity in the 1960s with the releases of &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (1962), &quot;Women of the World&quot; (1963) and &quot;Africa Addio&quot; (1966). The genre arguably reached its peak with &quot;Faces of Death&quot; (1978), a film that inspired a myriad of imitators, such as &quot;Banned from Television&quot;, &quot;Death Scenes&quot;, and the &quot;Traces of Death&quot; and &quot;Faces of Gore&quot; series.

==History==
Although earlier films such as Alessandro Blasetti&#x27;s (&quot;Europe by Night&quot; or &quot;European Nights&quot;, 1959) and (&quot;World by Night&quot;, 1960) may be considered examples of the genre, the origins of the &quot;mondo documentary&quot; are generally traced to the 1962 Italian film &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (&quot;A Dog&#x27;s World&quot;—a mild Italian profanity) by Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi which was a commercial success.

Documentary films imitating &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; in the 1960s often included the term in their titles, even if they were in English; examples include &quot;Mondo Bizarro&quot;, &quot;Mondo Daytona&quot;, &quot;Mondo Mod&quot;, &quot;Mondo Infame&quot; and &quot;Mondo Hollywood&quot;. Films outside the genre followed suit: &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot;, &quot;Mondo Weirdo: A Trip to Paranoia Paradise&quot;, &quot;Mondo Keyhole&quot; and &quot;Mondo Brutale&quot; (a German release of Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;) title themselves &quot;mondo&quot;, although none are &quot;mondo documentaries&quot;. Later in the decade, this naming convention began to fall out of favour and fewer mondo films identified themselves as such in their titles.

Filmmakers wanted to top each other in shock value to attract audiences. Cruelty to animals, accidents, tribal-initiation rites and surgeries are features of a typical mondo. Much of the action is staged, although the filmmakers may claim their goal is to document &quot;reality&quot;. Subjects of &quot;mondo films&quot; include sex (&quot;Mondo Sex&quot; and &quot;Mondo Sexualis USA&quot;); celebrities (&quot;Mondo Elvis&quot; and &quot;Mondo Lugosi&quot;); youth culture (&quot;Mondo Teeno&quot;) and the gay subculture (&quot;Mondo Rocco&quot;).

Russ Meyer&#x27;s film &quot;Mondo Topless&quot; was one of the few &quot;documentaries&quot; restricted to the old midnight movie circuit in the pre-VCR era; it explored strip clubs in 1960s San Francisco, at a time when strip clubs were a novelty in the United States, restricted to centers of port-city decadence (such as San Francisco). Other examples of this genre include &quot;Mondo New York&quot; by Harvey Keith, &quot;Mondo di Notte&quot; by Gianni Proia and &quot;Mondo Balordo&quot; by Roberto Bianchi Montero.

The 1980s saw a resurgence of &quot;mondo movies&quot; focusing almost exclusively on (onscreen) death, instead of world cultures. The &quot;Faces of Death&quot; series is a notable example of this type of &quot;mondo&quot; (or &quot;death&quot;) movie. The producers used fake footage (passed off as real), but some of the footage was legitimate (including scenes of autopsies, suicides and accidents). The Italian cannibal film is arguably an offshoot of the mondo film.
The rare 1985 film &quot;Mondo Senza Veli&quot; (&quot;World Without Veils&quot; or &quot;Mondo Fresh&quot;) was purported by viewers to feature at its end the brutal execution of a young Arab rapist by public rectal impalement. This episode was, however, believed to have been a staged execution by some viewers.

&quot;Mondo films&quot; in the 21st century feature gore, exemplified by the &quot;Faces of Gore&quot; and &quot;Traces of Death&quot; series. There is less fake footage, and many use news footage of accidents from East Asia.

The late 2010s saw another resurgence, beginning with the &quot;Bootleg Death Tape&quot; series and &quot;Faces of Dying&quot; series from filmmaker Dustin Ferguson, which both involved various independent directors from around the world.

A number of films have parodied the genre. Examples include Ricardo Fratelli&#x27;s &quot;Mondo Ford&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot; by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s Michael O&#x27;Donoghue, and &quot;Is There Sex After Death?&quot; by Jeanne and Alan Abel. &quot;Mondo Beyondo&quot; spoofed the films&#x27; approach to titling, but was a parody of satellite television.

== Films ==

The original &quot;mondo film&quot; series was the &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; series by Gualtiero Jacopetti, Paolo Cavara, and Franco Prosperi. When this type of film proved successful, many imitators followed.

The pair&#x27;s &quot;Mondo candido&quot; (1975) is not a &quot;mondo film&quot;; the title was imposed on them by the studio, who wished to cash in on their earlier successes. The film is a retelling of Voltaire&#x27;s novel, &quot;Candide&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Stelvio Massi (a.k.a. Max Steele) made two spin-offs of the original &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; series, known as &quot;Mondo Cane 3&quot; and &quot;Mondo Cane 4&quot; on video.

In 1969, brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni began to make a series of their own &quot;mondo films&quot; until the early 1980s. They made five films in all, tying Jacopetti and Prosperi as the most prolific mondo film producers. Each film examines brutal and bizarre behavior on the African continent. Their films are considered some of the most graphic &quot;mondo films&quot; ever made.

Antonio Climati, cinematographer to Prosperi and Jacopetti in many &quot;mondo films&quot;, joined Mario Morra in 1974 to produce their own string of &quot;mondo films&quot;, known as the &quot;Savage Trilogy&quot;. Prosperi also produced the films. Climati and Morra were known for staging scenes.

The 1978 &quot;Faces of Death&quot; popularized a &quot;mondo&quot; style known as &quot;death films&quot;, which depicted humans or animals dying in graphic ways.

Uwe Schier bought the rights to the &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; and &quot;Faces of Death&quot; films and released his own entries in both series, consisting largely of footage lifted from other &quot;mondo films&quot;. &quot;Faces of Death V&quot; draws heavily on &quot;Death Scenes&quot;; &quot;Faces of Death VI&quot; consists almost entirely of &quot;Days of Fury&quot; and &quot;Mondo Cane IV&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Mondo Cane 2000, l&#x27;Incredibile&quot;, Schier&#x27;s &quot;Mondo Cane IV&quot; is in fact the fifth film in the series) lifts from other films (including &quot;Death Scenes&quot; and &quot;Death Faces IV&quot;). In 1993, Hurricane Pictures edited a mix of scenes featured in &quot;Addio ultimo uomo&quot; and &quot;Shocking Africa&quot;, labeling it the &quot;fifth chapter&quot; of the saga (&quot;Teil V&quot; in German).


Several imitators followed the &quot;Faces of Death&quot; series; many used (or were composed entirely of) footage from other &quot;mondo films&quot;.

Other &quot;mondo films&quot; and movies influenced by the genre were released.

<text>Christian Frederick Schwarz (with spellings including Friedrich and Schwartz or Swartz) (8 October 1726 – 13 February 1798) was a German Lutheran missionary to India. He was known for his linguistic skills, with knowledge of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu, Persian, Marathi, and Telugu and worked with the British to serve as an emissary of peace and sent to the court of Haider Ali in Mysore. He worked alongside the Indian royal families, tutoring the Raja Serfoji of Tanjore, and was influential in establishing Protestant Christianity in southern India.

==Life==
Christian was born on 8 October (sometimes given as 22 or 26 October 1726) at Sonnenburg, in the electorate of Brandenburg, Prussia. His father was George Schwartz and his mother Margaret Grunerin; after several deaths in the family, his mother dedicated her infant boy to Christ and ensured that he would be trained for Christian service. His mother died when he was young and he went to grammar school in Sonnenburg under Mr Helm. He learnt Latin and Greek with some amount of Hebrew which he hoped to improve with studies in the town of Custrin. In 1746 he moved to study at the University of Halle where he met Schulz who had worked in the Madras Mission. Schultz was working on Tamil bible and sought help from Schwarz. Having learned Tamil to assist in a translation of the Bible into that language, he was led to form the intention of becoming a missionary to India. He received ordination at Copenhagen on 8 August 1749, and, after spending some time in England to acquire the English language, embarked early in 1750 for India.

He arrived at Tiruchirapalli on 30 July via Tranquebar. Tranquebar was for some time his headquarters, but he paid frequent visits to Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli, and in 1766 moved to Tiruchirapalli. Here he acted as chaplain to the garrison, who erected a church for his general use.

There was an explosion of the ammunition dump of East India company in 1761. A lot of Native soldiers died in that explosion, and he established Bishop Heber School in Trichinopoly for the soldiers&#x27; orphaned children. Again there was another ammunition dump explosion in Trichinopoly in 1763. In which all the British soldiers and their wives perished. Only 14 children of the soldiers survived and Schwarz started a school in the Vestry of St. John&#x27;s Church which had been built by the British soldiers.
Later the army gave some land, about five acres adjoining the army garrison to build a proper school. The school was built British army personnel and civilians who were Freemasons.

In 1769, he secured the friendship of the king Raja Tuljaji, who, although he never converted to Christianity, afforded him every countenance in his missionary labours. Shortly before his death he committed to Schwarz the education of his adopted son and successor Sarabhoji (Serfoji). Schwarz taught the prince, Prince Serfoji, and another slightly older pupil Vedanayagam using the gurukulam approach, where the teacher and the pupil live together. Raja Serfoji built a church to show his affection to Schwartz and it is still seen as a symbol of tolerance on the part of that great Mahratta ruler towards different religions.

In 1779, Schwarz undertook, at the request of the British authorities in Madras (present day Chennai), a private embassy to Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore. When Hyder invaded the Carnatic, Schwarz was allowed to pass through the enemy&#x27;s camp without molestation. In 1784 he established an English school in Thanjavur and this school is now known as St. Peter&#x27;s Higher Secondary School. After twelve years in Tiruchirapalli he moved to Thanjavur, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died on 13 February 1798 just before Serfoji II ascended the throne. He was laid to rest in St.Peter&#x27;s Church in Maharnonbuchavadi, Thanjavur. In his tomb there is a tombstone with a short memoir and an elegy in English written by Serfoji II.

==Legacy==
Schwarz&#x27;s direct success in making converts exceeded that of any other Protestant missionary in India, in addition to which he succeeded in winning the esteem of Muslims and Hindus. The raja of Tanjore erected a monument, executed by John Flaxman, in the mission church, in which he is represented as grasping the hand of the dying missionary and receiving his benediction. A monument to Schwarz by John Bacon was placed by the British East India Company in St Mary&#x27;s church at Chennai. Schwarz High School in Ramanathapuram has produced notable students, among them Dr. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India.

The following is the wording of the Memorial commissioned by Raja Serfoji

&quot;To the memory of the Reverend Christian Frederic Swartz. Born at Sonnenburg of Neumark in the Kingdom of Prussia, the 26th of October 1726, and died at Tanjore the 13th of February 1798, in the 72d Year of his age.&quot;
&quot;Devoted from his Early Manhood to the Office of Missionary in the East, the similarity of his situation to that of the first preachers of the gospel, produced in him a peculiar resemblance to the simple sanctity of the apostolic character.&quot;
&quot;His natural vivacity won the affection as his unspotted probity and purity of life alike commanded the reverence of the Christian, Mahomedan and Hindu. For sovereign princes, Hindu, and Mahomeden selected this humble pastor as the medium of political negotiations with the British Government&quot;
&quot;- Maha Raja Serfojee&quot;

<doc id="1176490" wikidata="Q6730032" url="?curid=1176490" title="Mage (comics)">
<text>Mage is an American superhero comic book written and illustrated by Matt Wagner, which he describes as an &quot;allegorical autobiography&quot; in which the hero, Kevin Matchstick, is a stand-in for the author, and &quot;[a]ll the other characters he encounters and situations he endures are metaphors from my own life... told through the lens of a fantasy adventure&quot;. Three volumes, each of 15 issues, have been published.

==Publication history==
Volume one, &quot;The Hero Discovered&quot;, was published by from February 1984 to December 1986. Despite advertisements saying that a sequel was &quot;coming soon&quot;, &quot;The Hero Defined&quot; did not appear until 1997, published by Image Comics (Comico had gone bankrupt in 1990, and it had taken some time for Wagner to regain the rights to the series). The third and final volume, &quot;The Hero Denied&quot;, began publication with an introductory &quot;zero issue&quot; in July 2017, with the first issue proper following in August. The final issue came out on February 27, 2019, thirty-five years after the publication of the first.

Wagner wrote and drew all three series, with Sam Kieth as inker for part of the first, Jeromy Cox as colorist for the second, and his son Brennan Wagner as colorist for the third.

==Plot synopsis==
&quot;The Hero Discovered&quot; follows Kevin Matchstick, an alienated young man who meets a wizard called Mirth and discovers that he, among other things, possesses both a magic baseball bat and superhuman abilities. In the course of the comic, he defeats the nefarious plans of a being called the Umbra Sprite. He ultimately discovers that Mirth is Merlin, the baseball bat is Excalibur, and he is, in some ambiguous way, King Arthur. All the chapter titles are lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

A backup story, &quot;Devil by the Deed&quot;, appeared in issues #6–14 of &quot;The Hero Discovered&quot;. This was a Grendel story that led directly into the Grendel comic series written by Wagner and drawn by a series of other artists.

&quot;The Hero Defined&quot; picks up Matchstick&#x27;s adventures several years later as he fights supernatural menaces in the company of other heroes, including Kirby Hero and Joe Phat. Each hero he encounters is based both on a mythological character and a comics professional of Wagner&#x27;s acquaintance (Kirby as Hercules and Bernie Mireault, Joe as Coyote and Joe Matt). There is a new mage this time—Mirth has disappeared, and Matchstick is followed around by an old tramp called Wally Ut, who insists he is Matchstick&#x27;s new mentor. In the course of the story Matchstick learns that he has misunderstood his mission, meets his future wife, and is alienated from his fellow heroes. He also discovers that he represents more than one mythical character: he is also Gilgamesh, and Kirby is also Enkidu. The chapter titles of &quot;The Hero Defined&quot; are from &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and Matchstick&#x27;s wife and her siblings are heavily based on the Weird Sisters.

&quot;The Hero Denied&quot; takes place several years after the second series. Matchstick and his family are in hiding, trying to avoid the Umbra Sprite, now known as the Umbra Witch, who has regenerated in a female form, and has female children called Gracklethorns, instead of the males in the first two series called Grackleflints. All of the chapters have titles taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The final issue came out on February 27, 2019, thirty-five years after the publication of the first comic.

The ultimate issue of each volume was double-sized, and featured a gatefold page of panoramic art. The final issue contains an eight-page gatefold.

&quot;Mage&quot; ran as a back up feature in Comico&#x27;s &quot;Grendel&quot; series issues #16–19.

<doc id="1176500" wikidata="Q777082" url="?curid=1176500" title="Aurora programme">
<text>The Aurora programme (sometimes called Aurora Exploration Programme, or simply Exploration Programme) was a human spaceflight programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) established in 2001. The objective was to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for exploration of the Solar System using robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of life beyond the Earth.

==Overview==
Member states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the ExoMars mission and preparations for an international Mars sample return mission.

The Aurora programme was a response to Europe&#x27;s Strategy for space which was endorsed by European Union Council of Research and the ESA Council. Europe strategy for space had three main points including:&quot;explore the solar system and the Universe&quot;, &quot;stimulate new technology&quot;, and &quot;inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology&quot;. One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program is recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration;.

==Missions==

The first decade is planned to focus on robotic missions.

===Flagship missions===

ESA describes some Aurora programme missions as &quot;Flagship&quot; missions. The first Flagship mission is ExoMars, a dual robotic mission to Mars made in cooperation with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos). It will involve development of a Mars orbiter (ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter), a technology demonstrator descent module (&quot;Schiaparelli&quot; lander) and the &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover.

Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme include:
* &quot;ExoMars&quot;, consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the Russian Federal Space Agency in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.
* &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover launch to be conducted jointly the Russian Federal Space Agency in the mid- or late-2020s
* a robotic &quot;Mars Sample Return Mission&quot; by the mid-2020s 
* a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s

===Arrow missions===

&quot;Arrow missions&quot; are technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions so far (as of 30 January 2003):
*&quot;Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule&quot;, a step in the preparations for the &quot;Mars Sample Return&quot; mission.
*&quot;Mars aerocapture demonstrator&quot;, to further develop the technologies for using a planet&#x27;s atmosphere to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate &quot;aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing&quot; to be launched in 2020. 
==Timeline==

The proposed Aurora roadmap (as of 30 September 2005. This roadmap can, and most likely will, go through revisions):
* 2014 – Human mission technologies demonstrator(s) to validate technologies for orbital assembly and docking, life support and human habitation
* 2016 and 2020 – ExoMars rover to Mars. The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.
* 2026 – Robotic mission to Mars
* 2030s – First human mission to Mars, as a split mission. The proposed Ariane M rocket may be used for this landing.

The human part of the programme has been challenged by the main ESA contributors (France, Germany and Italy), making it quite possible that the whole Aurora Programme will be refocused on robotic-only exploration of Mars.

<doc id="1176501" wikidata="Q2147196" url="?curid=1176501" title="Reynolds Museum">
<text>The Reynolds-Alberta Museum is an agricultural, industrial, and transportation museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, Canada. The museum is situated on an property containing the main museum building, an aviation display hangar, and its storage facility.

The museum was initially conceived by Stan Reynolds, who had amassed a large collection of agricultural machinery, airplanes, and automobiles during the mid-20th century. During the 1980s, Reynolds donated 850 artifacts to the government of Alberta for the purposes of showcasing these items in a public museum. The provincial government opened the Reynolds-Alberta Museum to exhibit these items to the public on 12 September 1992. The institution was named after Reynolds, who eventually donated over 1,500 artifacts to the institution before his death.

The museum collection presently contains over 6,600 agricultural, industrial, and transportation artifacts. The majority of the artifacts are held in the museum&#x27;s storage facility; although a number of artifacts are either on exhibit in the museum&#x27;s main building and aviation display hangar, or on tour.

==History==

The museum&#x27;s initial collection originated from the private collections of Stan Reynolds; who acquired a large number of agricultural machines, airplanes, and automobiles through trade-ins he would accept at a car dealership he operated. By 1955, Reynolds had acquired enough vehicles to open a &quot;private museum&quot; to exhibit his collection. Desires to have his collection permanently displayed in a public museum led Reynolds to discuss the possibility of donating the collection to the provincial government in 1974; which eventually resulted in him donating 850 artifacts to the government of Alberta between 1981 and 1986. The donation represented the largest of its kind in Canadian history.

On 12 September 1992, the government of Alberta opened the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in order to exhibit the donated items, with the institution being operated by Alberta Culture, Multiculturalism, and Status of Women. The Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame was also relocated from the Edmonton Convention Centre to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum after the building was completed The hall of fame was housed at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum until 2022, when it was relocated to The Hangar Flight Museum in Calgary. Stan Reynolds continued to donate artifacts to the museums collection after the institution opened, with Reynolds donating another 60 aircraft in 1999; the largest donation of vintage aircraft in Canadian history. In the early 2000s, several vehicles from the Reynolds-Alberta Museum were displayed at the Powerama Motoring Expo in Edmonton.

In August 2017, the provincial government announced it would provide over million to the museum over the next three years; with approximately million being used to expand the museum by , as well as creating an aviation storage facility. In August 2019, the federal government also committed funds towards the expansion project. However, in March 2020, Alberta Culture, Multiculturalism, and Status of Women announced that construction would not proceed as planned, with the expansion plans placed on hold.

==Site==

The museum is located on an property in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. The property is adjacent to Wetaskiwin Regional Airport, and is situated near the eastern portion of Alberta Highway 13 before it branches north. Three major buildings are situated on the property; the main museum building, the aviation display hangar, and the collections storage facility. RPK Architects served as the architect for the museum buildings.

The main museum building is and houses the museum&#x27;s exhibition gallery. The gallery has a number of artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collection on display, in addition to several interactive displays on mechanization and how it changed life in Alberta from the 1890s to the present. Historically themed interactive exhibits include a 1911 automobile assembly line, a 1920s grain elevator, a 1930s service station, and a 1950s drive-in theatre. Other facilities in the main museum building include a theatre, offices, a café, event venues, and a gift shop. The main museum building also houses a conservation and restoration workshop to restore its vehicles; and a library/resource centre, whose collection pertains to transportation and agricultural machinery. The museum&#x27;s library contains over 1,800 publications and 18,000 trade literature items. 

The display hangar is a hangar connected to Wetaskiwin Regional Airport, and is used to exhibit airplanes from the museum&#x27;s collection. Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame, which moved to the display hangar in 1992 when the museum opened, moved to The Hangar Flight Museum in Calgary in 2022.

The storage facility houses artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collection which are not on exhibit in its main building nor at its aviation display hangar. As opposed to the other museum buildings, access to the storage facility remains limited to the public. However, the museum does provide private tours of the facility.

==Collections==
The museum&#x27;s collection originated from the private collections of Stan Reynolds, who donated a number of items to the government of Alberta in 1981, and later the museum after it was opened in 1992. Reynolds donated approximately 1,500 artifacts to the museum before his death in 2012. In addition to items donated by Reynolds, artifacts in the collection were either purchased by the museum or were gifted to the institution by members of the public, and the Reynolds Heritage Preservation Foundation. 

As of April 2019, the museum&#x27;s collection contained approximately 6,600 agricultural, industrial, and transportation artifacts.
In addition to machinery, the museum&#x27;s collection also includes a number of documents relating to mechanization in industry and transportation. More than 100 major artifacts are on display in the main museum building&#x27;s exhibition gallery. However, the museum&#x27;s collections storage facility holds the majority of the museum&#x27;s artifacts; with over 5,000 items stored there. Several artifacts are also exhibited in travelling exhibitions as a part of the museum&#x27;s artifact tour program.

The museum&#x27;s agricultural and industrial collection includes 350 agricultural machines and 455 industrial artifacts; including a Bucyrus-Erie 200-B power shovel, and a Bucyrus Class 24 dragline from 1929. The Bucyrus Class 24 the world&#x27;s oldest existing dragline excavator.

The museum&#x27;s transportation collection also includes 537 cars, motorcycles, and trucks. Automobiles in the museum&#x27;s collection include a Hupp-Yeats, a 1929 Duesenberg Phaeton Royale Model J, a 1933 Ford Fordor, and one of the two surviving 1934 Citroën P17 half-track used during the Bedaux expedition. The world&#x27;s oldest known Chevrolet, a 1913 Chevrolet Series C Classic Six, is also held in the museum&#x27;s collection. Newer vehicles in the museum&#x27;s collection include the BugE, an electric vehicle donated to the museum. In 2018, the museum acquired one of the two McLaughlin-Buick automobiles used by the royal family during the 1939 royal tour of Canada; in addition to other related memorabilia from the tour.

The museum&#x27;s collection also includes 135 aircraft; providing the institution with the second largest collection of airplanes in Canada, after the Canada Aviation and Space Museum. The museum also has the full-scale Avro Arrow model used in &quot;The Arrow&quot; miniseries.

=== Resource Centre ===
The museum&#x27;s resource centre contains the largest publicly accessible library of trade literature in North America, containing more than 70,000 items including service manuals, parts catalogues, technical leaflets, periodicals, and books.

<text>Filet mignon (; ; ) is a cut of meat taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin, or psoas major of a cow. In French, it mostly refers to cuts of pork tenderloin.

The tenderloin runs along both sides of the spine, and is usually butchered as two long snake-shaped cuts of meat. The tenderloin is sometimes sold whole. Filet mignon is usually presented as a round cut taken from the thinner end of a piece of tenderloin. It is often the most tender and lean cut. Filet mignon often has a milder flavour than other cuts of meat and as such is often garnished with a sauce or wrapped with bacon.

Due to the small amount of filet mignon able to be butchered from each animal, it is generally considered one of the most expensive cuts of beef.

==Usage==

=== Europe ===

In France, the term refers to pork. The cut of beef referred to as filet mignon in the United States has various names across the rest of Europe; e.g., &quot;filet de bœuf&quot; in French and &quot;filet pur&quot; in Belgium, &quot;fillet steak&quot; in the UK, &quot;Filetsteak&quot; in German, &quot;solomillo&quot; in Spanish (&quot;filet&quot; in Catalan), &quot;lombo&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;filee steik&quot; in Estonian, and &quot;filetbiff&quot; in Norwegian. 

In the UK, &quot;pork fillet&quot; or &quot;pork medallion&quot; is the term used to describe a similar cut from a pig.

=== North America ===
Filet mignon refers to cuts from a beef tenderloin in North America.
Elsewhere, this cut of beef is called:
* Filet de bœuf (French)
*Fillet steak (English: UK, Ireland, South Africa)
* Eye fillet (English: Australia, New Zealand).

In the U.S., both the central and large end of the tenderloin are often sold as &quot;filet mignon&quot; in supermarkets and restaurants. The French terms for these cuts are &quot;tournedos&quot; (the smaller central portion), &quot;châteaubriand&quot; (the larger central portion), and &quot;biftek&quot; (cut from the large end known as the &quot;tête de filet&quot; (lit. &#x27;head of filet&#x27;) in French).

Porterhouse steaks and T-bone steaks are large cuts that include the filet. The small medallion on one side of the bone is the filet, and the long strip of meat on the other side of the bone is the strip steak.

<doc id="1176517" wikidata="Q826776" url="?curid=1176517" title="World Community Grid">
<text>World Community Grid (WCG) is an effort to create the world&#x27;s largest volunteer computing platform to perform scientific research that benefits humanity. Launched on November 16, 2004, with proprietary Grid MP client from United Devices and adding support for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) in 2005, World Community Grid eventually discontinued the Grid MP client and consolidated on the BOINC platform in 2008. In September 2021, it was announced that IBM transferred ownership to the Krembil Research Institute of University Health Network in Toronto, Ontario.

World Community Grid uses unused processing power of consumer devices (PCs, Laptops, Android Smartphones, etc.) to analyse data created by the research groups that participate in the grid. WCG projects have analysed data related to the human genome, the human microbiome, HIV, dengue, muscular dystrophy, cancer, influenza, Ebola, Zika virus, virtual screening, rice crop yields, clean energy, water purification and COVID-19, among other research areas.

There are currently five active projects and 26 completed projects. Several of these projects have published peer-reviewed papers based on the analysis of the data generated by WCG. These include an OpenZika project paper on the discovery of a compound (FAM 3) that inhibits the NS3 Helicase protein of the Zika virus, thus reducing viral replication by up to 86%; a FightAIDS@home paper on the discovery of new vulnerabilities on the HIV-1 Capsid protein which may allow for a new drug target; and a FightAIDS@home paper on new computational drug discovery techniques for more refined and accurate results.

==History==
In 2003, IBM and other research participants sponsored the &quot;Smallpox Research Grid Project&quot; to accelerate the discovery of a cure for smallpox. The smallpox study used a massive distributed computing grid to analyse compounds&#x27; effectiveness against smallpox. The project allowed scientists to screen 35 million potential drug molecules against several smallpox proteins to identify good candidates for developing into smallpox treatments. In the first 72 hours, 100,000 results were returned. By the end of the project, 44 strong treatment candidates had been identified. Based on the success of the Smallpox study, IBM announced the creation of World Community Grid on November 16, 2004, with the goal of creating a technical environment where other humanitarian research could be processed.

World Community Grid initially only supported Windows, using the proprietary Grid MP software from United Devices which powered the grid.org distributed computing projects. Demand for Linux support led to the addition in November 2005 of open source Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software which powers projects such as SETI@home and Climateprediction. Mac OS and Linux support was added since the introduction of BOINC. In 2007, the World Community Grid migrated from Grid MP to BOINC for all of its supported platforms.

In September 2021, IBM announced that it had transferred ownership of the World Community Grid to the Krembil Research Institute.

===Scale of the project===
As of , World Community Grid had over active user accounts, with over active devices. Over the course of the project, more than cumulative years of computing time have been donated, and over work units have been completed.

==Operation==
The World Community Grid software uses the unused computing time of Internet-connected devices to perform research calculations. Users install WCG client software onto their devices. This software works in the background, using spare system resources to process work for WCG. When a piece of work or &quot;workunit&quot; is completed, the client software sends it back to WCG over the Internet and downloads a new workunit. To ensure accuracy, the WCG servers send out multiple copies of each workunit. Then, when the results are received, they are collected and validated against each other.

World Community Grid offers multiple humanitarian projects under a single umbrella.
Users are included in a subset of projects by default, but may opt out of projects as they choose.

Even though WCG makes use of open source client software, the actual applications that perform the scientific calculations may not be. However, several of the science applications are available under a free license, although the source is not available directly from WCG.

===Potential problems===

The World Community Grid software increases CPU usage by consuming unused processing time; in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such calculations were meant to reduce &quot;wasted&quot; CPU cycles. With modern CPUs, where dynamic frequency scaling is prevalent, increased usage makes the processor run at higher frequency, increasing power usage and heating counter to power management. Additionally, because of an increasing focus on power performance, or performance per watt, connecting old/inefficient computers to the grid will increase the total/average power required to complete the same calculations.

The BOINC client avoids slowing the computer by using a variety of limits that suspend computation when there are insufficient free resources. Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.

An add-on program for Windows computers – TThrottle – can solve the problem of overheating by directly limiting the BOINC project&#x27;s use of the host computer. It does this by measuring the CPU and/or the GPU temperature and adjusts the run time accordingly. It also uses a shorter switching time of less than one second, resulting in less temperature change during switching.

==Statistics and competition==
The contributions of each user are recorded and user contribution statistics are publicly available. Due to the fact that the processing time of each workunit varies from computer to computer, depending on the difficulty of the workunit, the speed of the computer, and the amount of idle resources available, contributions are usually measured in terms of &quot;points&quot;. Points are awarded for each workunit depending on the effort required to process it.

Upon completing a workunit, the BOINC client will request the number of points it thinks it deserves based on software benchmarks (&quot;see BOINC Credit System#Cobblestones&quot;). Since multiple computers process the same workunit to ensure accuracy, the World Community Grid servers can look at the points claimed by each of those computers. The WCG servers disregard statistical outliers, average the remaining values and award the resulting number of points to each computer.

Within the grid, users may join teams that have been created by organizations, groups, or individuals. Teams allow for a heightened sense of community identity and can also inspire competition. As teams compete against each other, more work is done for the grid overall.

==Outreach==
World Community Grid recognizes companies and organizations as &quot;partners&quot; if they promote WCG within their company or organization. As of April 2021, WCG had 452 partners.

Also, as part of its commitment to improving human health and welfare, the results of all computations completed on World Community Grid are released into the public domain and made available to the scientific community.

==Scientific results==
Since its launch, more than thirty projects have run in the World Community Grid. Some of the results include:

* In February 2014, the Help Fight Childhood Cancer project scientists announced the discovery of 7 compounds that destroy neuroblastoma cancer cells without any apparent side effects. This discovery, made with the support of the WCG volunteers, is a positive step towards a new treatment. The project has announced that it is seeking a collaboration with a pharmaceutical company in order to develop the compounds into treatments. Given the success of the project, the scientists have stated that they are already planning a follow-up project which will focus on other pediatric cancers, possibly in collaboration with a newly formed Pan-Asian oncology group, of which they are a founding member. 
*As of July 2012, the Human Proteome Folding Project has published several papers using data from WCG. These include a paper on validation methods and a new database of protein structure and function predictions; a paper on the identification of proteins that regulate human processes; a paper on the analysis of the genomes from five plant families and their proteomes, for which WCG was used in the creation of over 29,000 protein structures; a paper on the proteome of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;.
*The GO Fight Against Malaria project reported the discovery of several molecules that are effective against Malaria and Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (including TDR-TB, for which there is no treatment available). The project also tested for new molecules against MRSA, Filariasis and Bubonic Plague. Laboratory testing continues in order to turn those molecules into possible treatments. GFAM was also the first project ever to perform a billion different docking calculations. A paper was published in January 2015, with two more pending submission. In June 2015, the project reported that of the two &quot;hits&quot; discovered against a drug-resistant tuberculosis strain, several &quot;analogs&quot; have been synthesized, the best one of which inhibits the growth of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and is relatively non-toxic to mammalian cells. Lack of funding prevented further research into the data.
*The Discovering Dengue Drugs - Together project scientists reported the discovery of several new Dengue protease inhibitors, most of which also inhibit the West Nile virus protease. A handful of these have already entered &quot;crucial pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies&quot;. In November 2014, an update reported that the scientists have a drug lead that disables a key enzyme that allows the Dengue virus to replicate. It has also shown the same behaviour in other flaviviruses, such as the West Nile virus. No negative side effects such as toxicity, carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have been observed, making this drug lead a very strong antiviral drug candidate for these viruses. The scientists are now working to synthesize variants of the molecule to improve its activity and enter planned pre-clinical and clinical trials. However, in an October 2018 update, the research team reported that none of their current designs had produced a highly potent dengue protease inhibitor that could be tested &quot;in vivo&quot;.
*In June 2013, the Clean Energy Project published a database of over 2.3 million organic molecules which have had their properties characterized. Of these, 35,000 molecules have shown the potential to double the efficiency over organic solar cells currently being produced. Before this initiative, scientists knew of just a handful of carbon-based materials that were able to convert sunlight into electricity efficiently.
*In February 2010, the FightAIDS@Home project scientists announced that they have found two compounds which make a potentially new class of AIDS-fighting drugs possible. The compounds attach to the virus at newly discovered binding sites, and thus can be used to &quot;enhance existing therapies, treat drug-resistant strains of the disease, and slow the evolution of drug resistance in the virus.&quot;
*In July 2015, the Drug Search for Leishmaniasis project announced it had tested the top 10 compounds with highest predicted efficiency out of over 100 identified via WCG workunits. Of those 10, 4 showed &quot;positive results&quot; in &quot;in vitro&quot; testing, with one showing &quot;an exceptionally promising result&quot;. In August 2017, &quot;in vivo&quot; testing of the 4 compounds on hamsters showed favourable results, with one compound inducing &quot;an almost complete curing of the lesions in two out of five hamsters.&quot; However, in a March 2018 update, the research team announced none of the 10 tested compounds had sufficient anti-leishmaniasis activity.
*In July 2015, the Computing for Clean Water project announced that a paper had been published in the Nature Nanotechnology journal describing a new type of water filter efficiently utilising nanotubes. &quot;[The] nanotubes are made of single-atom-thick sheets of carbon atoms, called graphene, rolled up into tiny tubes, with diameters of just a few nanometers - one ten-thousandth the diameter of a human hair. The size of the tubes allows water molecules to pass through, but blocks larger pathogens and contaminants, purifying the water.&quot; By running simulations on WCG, the scientists discovered that certain kinds of natural vibrations called phonons, under specific conditions, can lead to more than 300% increased flow of water through the nanotubes, compared to previous theoretical predictions.
*In April 2015, the Say No To Schistosoma project scientists reported that subsequent analysis had been performed, and the three most promising candidate substances had been identified for &quot;in vitro&quot; testing.
*In March 2019, FightAIDS@Home researchers published a paper describing a &quot;Novel Intersubunit Interaction Critical for HIV-1 Core Assembly&quot; that &quot;defines a Potentially Targetable Inhibitor Binding Pocket&quot;. Using World Community Grid, more than 1.6 million compounds were used to target 20 conformations of this pocket. Preliminary results suggest it to be a plausible binding site for antiviral compounds. Further analysis of these compounds are the subject of an independent study.

==Active subprojects==

=== OpenPandemics - COVID-19 ===
On April 1, 2020, IBM announced OpenPandemics - COVID-19. The project aims to identify possible treatments for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. WCG will partner with Scripps Research, with whom it has partnered in the past, notably in FightAIDS@Home projects. The project runs on CPUs and GPUs and will also serve to create a &quot;fast-response, open source tool that will help all scientists quickly search for treatments for future pandemics.&quot;

The project launched on May 14, 2020.

===Mapping Cancer Markers===
Mapping Cancer Markers (launched November 8, 2013). The project aims to identify the markers associated with various types of cancer, and is analyzing millions of data points collected from thousands of healthy and cancerous patient tissue samples. These include tissues with lung, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancers. By comparing these different data points, researchers aim to identify patterns of markers for different cancers and correlate them with different outcomes, including responsiveness to various treatment options. The project is focusing on 4 types of cancer, with the first focus being on lung cancer, and will move on to ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and sarcoma.

=== Africa Rainfall Project ===
The Africa Rainfall Project (launched October 2019) will use the computing power of World Community Grid, data from The Weather Company, and other data to improve rainfall modelling, which can help farmers in sub-Saharan Africa successfully raise their crops.
The amount of RAM that can be involved in calculations is from 1 to 16 gigabytes.

==Completed subprojects==
===Human Proteome Folding – Phase 1===
The first project launched on World Community Grid was the Human Proteome Folding Project, or HPF1, which aims to predict the structure of human proteins. The project was launched on November 16, 2004, and completed on July 18, 2006. This project was unique in that computation was done in tandem with the grid.org distributed computing project. Devised by Richard Bonneau at the Institute for Systems Biology, the project used grid computing to produce the likely structures for each of the proteins using a Rosetta Score. From these predictions, researchers hope to predict the function of the myriad proteins. This increased understanding of the human proteins could prove vital in the search for cures to human diseases. Computing for this project was officially completed on July 18, 2006. Research results for the yeast portion of HPF1 have been published.

===Human Proteome Folding – Phase 2===
Human Proteome Folding - Phase 2 (HPF2) (launched June 23, 2006) was the third project to run on World Community Grid, and completed in 2013. This project, following on from HPF1, focused on human-secreted proteins, with special focus on biomarkers and the proteins on the surface of cells as well as Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria. HPF2 generates higher-resolution protein models than HPF1. Though these higher-resolution models are more useful, they also require more processing power to generate.

In a July 2012 status report, the project scientists reported that the results generated by the WCG calculations are being used by Dr. Markus Landthaler of the Max Delbruch Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin. The HPF2 results helped Dr. Markus Landthaler and his collaborators in writing up a new paper on &quot;The mRNA-Bound Proteome and Its Global Occupancy Profile on Protein-Coding Transcripts&quot;

===Help Defeat Cancer===
The Help Defeat Cancer project seeks to improve the ability of medical professionals to determine the best treatment options for patients with breast, head, or neck cancer. The project was launched on July 20, 2006, and completed in April 2007. The project worked by identifying visual patterns in large numbers of tissue microarrays taken from archived tissue samples. By correlating the pattern data with information about treatment and patient outcome, the results of this project could help provide better targeted treatment options.

===Genome Comparison===
The Genome Comparison project is sponsored by the Brazilian research institution Fiocruz. The project was launched on November 21, 2006, and completed on July 21, 2007. The project seeks to compare gene sequences of different organisms against each other in order to find similarities between them. Scientists hope to discover what purpose a particular gene sequence serves in a particular function of one organism, via comparing it to a similar gene sequence of known function in another organism.

===Help Cure Muscular Dystrophy – Phase 1===
Help Cure Muscular Dystrophy is run by Décrypthon, a collaboration between French Muscular Dystrophy Association, French National Center for Scientific Research and IBM. Phase 1 was launched on December 19, 2006, and completed on June 11, 2007. The project investigated protein–protein interactions for 40,000 proteins whose structures are known, with particular focus on those proteins that play a role in neuromuscular diseases. The database of information produced will help researchers design molecules to inhibit or enhance binding of particular macromolecules, hopefully leading to better treatments for muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases. This project was available only to agents running the Grid MP client, making it unavailable to users running BOINC.

===Discovering Dengue Drugs – Together===
Discovering Dengue Drugs – Together was sponsored by scientists at the University of Texas and the University of Chicago and will run in two phases. Phase 1, launched August 21, 2007, used AutoDock 2007 (the same software used for FightAIDS@Home) to test potential antiviral drugs (through NS3 protease inhibition) against viruses from the family flaviviridae and completed on August 11, 2009. Phase 2 &quot;[uses] a more computationally intensive program to screen the candidates that make it through Phase 1.&quot; The drug candidates that make it through Phase 2 will then be lab-tested.

===AfricanClimate@Home===
The mission of AfricanClimate@Home was to develop more accurate climate models of specific regions in Africa. It was intended to serve as a basis for understanding how the climate will change in the future so that measures designed to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change could be implemented. World Community Grid&#x27;s tremendous computing power was used to understand and reduce the uncertainty with which climate processes were simulated over Africa. Phase 1 of African Climate@Home launched on September 3, 2007, and ended in July 2008.

===Help Conquer Cancer===
Help Conquer Cancer project (launched November 1, 2007) is sponsored by the Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI), Princess Margaret Hospital and University Health Network of Toronto, Canada. The project involves X-ray crystallography. The mission of Help Conquer Cancer is to improve the results of protein X-ray crystallography, which helps researchers not only annotate unknown parts of the human proteome, but importantly improves their understanding of cancer initiation, progression and treatment.

The HCC project was the first WCG project benefiting from graphics processing units (GPU)s which helped finish it a lot earlier than initially projected due to the massive power of GPUs. In the April 2013 status report the scientists report there is still a lot of data to analyze but that they are preparing a new project that will search for prognostic and predictive signatures (sets of genes, proteins, microRNAs, etc.) that help predict patient survival and response to treatment.
The project finished in May 2013.

===Nutritious Rice for the World===
The Nutritious Rice for the World project is carried out by Ram Samudrala&#x27;s Computational Biology Research Group at the University of Washington. The project was launched on May 12, 2008, and completed on April 6, 2010. The purpose of this project is to predict the structure of proteins of major strains of rice, in order to help farmers breed better rice strains with higher crop yields, promote greater disease and pest resistance, and utilize a full range of bioavailable nutrients that can benefit people around the world, especially in regions where malnutrition is a critical concern. The project has been covered by more than 200 media outlets since its inception. On April 13, 2010, World Community Grid officially announced that the Nutritious Rice for the World project finished on April 6, 2010.

In April 2014, an update was posted stating that the research team was able to publish structural information about thousands of proteins, and advance the field of computational protein modeling. These results – which were only possible because of the massive amount of donated computing power they had available – are expected to guide future research and plant science efforts.

===The Clean Energy Project===
The Clean Energy project is sponsored by the scientists of Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. The mission of the Clean Energy Project is to find new materials for the next generation of solar cells and later, energy storage devices. Researchers are employing molecular mechanics and electronic structure calculations to predict the optical and transport properties of molecules that could become the next generation of solar cell materials.

Phase 1 was launched on December 5, 2008, and completed on October 13, 2009. By harnessing the computing power of the World Community Grid, researchers were able to calculate the electronic properties of tens of thousands of organic materials – many more than could ever be tested in a lab – and determine which candidates are most promising for developing affordable solar energy technology.

Phase 2 was launched June 28, 2010, sponsored by the scientists of Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Further calculations about optical, electronic and other physical properties of the candidate materials are being conducted with the Q-Chem quantum chemistry software. Their findings have been submitted to the Energy &amp; Environmental Science journal.

===Help Fight Childhood Cancer===

Help Fight Childhood Cancer project (launched March 13, 2009) is sponsored by the scientists at Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute and Chiba University. The mission of the Help Fight Childhood Cancer project is to find drugs that can disable three particular proteins associated with neuroblastoma, one of the most frequently occurring solid tumors in children. Identifying these drugs could potentially make the disease much more curable when combined with chemotherapy treatment.

===Influenza Antiviral Drug Search===
Influenza Antiviral Drug Search project is sponsored by Dr. Stan Watowich and his research team at The University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, Texas, USA). The project was launched on May 5, 2009, and completed on October 22, 2009. The mission of the Influenza Antiviral Drug Search project is to find new drugs that can stop the spread of an influenza infection in the body. The research will specifically address the influenza strains that have become drug resistant as well as new strains that are appearing. Identifying the chemical compounds that are the best candidates will accelerate the efforts to develop treatments that would be useful in managing seasonal influenza outbreaks, and future influenza epidemics and even pandemics. Phase 1 of The Influenza Antiviral Drug Search project has already finished on October 22, 2009. Now the researchers are performing post-processing on the results from Phase 1 and are preparing for Phase 2.

In November 2012, the project&#x27;s scientists stated that, given the fact that there is no immediate danger of an influenza outbreak, all of the project&#x27;s results would be posted online and their resources would be refocused on the Dengue Project.

===Help Cure Muscular Dystrophy – Phase 2===
World Community Grid and researchers supported by Decrypthon, a partnership between AFM (French Muscular Dystrophy Association), CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research), Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, and IBM were investigating protein–protein interactions for more than 2,200 proteins whose structures are known, with particular focus on those proteins that play a role in neuromuscular diseases. Phase 2 was launched on May 12, 2009, and completed on September 26, 2012. The database of information produced will help researchers design molecules to inhibit or enhance binding of particular macromolecules, hopefully leading to better treatments for muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases.

Phase 2 of the Help Cure Muscular Dystrophy project began once the results from the first phase had been analyzed. Phase 2 ran on the BOINC platform.

===Discovering Dengue Drugs – Together – Phase 2===
Discovering Dengue Drugs – Together – Phase 2 (launched February 17, 2010) is sponsored by The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas, United States and the University of Chicago in Illinois, USA. The mission is to identify promising drug candidates to combat the Dengue, Hepatitis C, West Nile, Yellow Fever, and other related viruses. The extensive computing power of World Community Grid will be used to complete the structure-based drug discovery calculations required to identify these drug candidates.

===Computing for Clean Water===
Computing for Clean Water (launched September 20, 2010) is sponsored by the Center for Nano and Micro Mechanics of Tsinghua University in Beijing. The project&#x27;s mission is to provide deeper insight on the molecular scale into the origins of the efficient flow of water through a novel class of filter materials. This insight will in turn guide future development of low-cost and more efficient water filters. It is estimated that 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and 2.6 billion have little or no sanitation. As a result, millions of people die annually – an estimated 3,900 children a day due to a lack of clean water. On April 25, 2014, the project scientists released an update stating that they had exciting results to report when the paper is submitted and that the project on WCG was finished.

===Drug Search for Leishmaniasis===
Drug Search for Leishmaniasis (launched September 7, 2011) is spearheaded by the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, with assistance from researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. The mission is to identify potential molecule candidates that could possibly be developed into treatments for Leishmaniasis. The extensive computing power of World Community Grid will be used to perform computer simulations of the interactions between millions of chemical compounds and certain target proteins. This will help find the most promising compounds that may lead to effective treatments for the disease.

===GO Fight Against Malaria Project===
The mission of the GO Fight Against Malaria project (launched November 16, 2011) is to discover promising drug candidates that could be developed into new drugs that cure drug resistant forms of malaria. The computing power of World Community Grid will be used to perform computer simulations of the interactions between millions of chemical compounds and certain target proteins, to predict their ability to eliminate malaria. The best compounds will be tested by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, U.S.A. and further developed into possible treatments for the disease.

===Say No to Schistosoma===
Say No to Schistosoma (launched February 22, 2012) was the 20th research project to be launched on World Community Grid. The researchers at Infórium University in Belo Horizonte and FIOCRUZ-Minas, Brazil, ran this project on World Community Grid to perform computer simulations of the interactions between millions of chemical compounds and certain target proteins in the hope of finding effective treatments for schistosomiasis. As of April 2015, subsequent analysis had been performed, and three of the most promising candidate substances had been identified for in-vitro testing.

===Computing for Sustainable Water===
Computing for Sustainable Water was the 21st research project to be launched on World Community Grid. The researchers at the University of Virginia were running this project on World Community Grid to study the effects of human activity on a large watershed and gain deeper insights into what actions can support the restoration, health and sustainability of this important water resource. The project was launched on April 17, 2012, and completed on October 17, 2012.

===Uncovering Genome Mysteries===
The Uncovering Genome Mysteries project launched on October 16, 2014, and is a joint collaboration between Australian and Brazilian scientists. The project aims to examine close to 200 million genes from many life forms and compare them with known genes in order to find out what their function is. The results could have an effect in fields such as medicine and environmental research.

===Outsmart Ebola Together===
Outsmart Ebola Together was a collaboration with the Scripps Research Institute to help find chemical compounds to fight Ebola virus disease. It was launched on 3 December 2014. The aim is to block crucial steps in the life cycle of the virus, by finding drugs with high binding affinity with certain of its proteins. There are two targets: a surface protein used by the virus to infect human cells, and &quot;transformer&quot; proteins which change shape to carry out different functions. The project officially completed December 6, 2018.

===OpenZika===
OpenZika was launched on May 18, 2016, to help combat the Zika virus. The project targets proteins that are believed to be used by the Zika virus to survive and spread in the body, based on known results from similar diseases like dengue fever and yellow fever. These results will help researchers develop an anti-Zika drug. The project officially completed December 13, 2019.

===FightAIDS@Home===
FightAIDS@Home (launched November 19, 2005) was World Community Grid&#x27;s second project and its first to target a single disease. Each individual computer processes one potential drug molecule and tests how well it would dock with HIV protease, acting as a protease inhibitor. Scripps Research Institute published its first peer-reviewed scientific paper about the results of FightAIDS@Home on April 21, 2007. This paper explains that the results up to that point will primarily be used to improve the efficiency of future FightAIDS@Home calculations.

===FightAIDS@Home Phase 2===
FightAIDS@Home Phase 2 (launched September 30, 2015) is looking more closely at the results of Phase 1. The project has two goals in the early experiments; the simulation architecture is functioning correctly and giving reliable results, and using BEDAM and AutoDock together provides better results than using just BEDAM or AutoDock.

===Microbiome Immunity Project===
Microbiome Immunity Project (launched August 2017) is a study of proteins in bacteria located in and on the human body; the human microbiome, which comprises around 3 million separate bacterial genes. By studying bacterial genes, researchers can determine their individual shapes, which in turn dictate the function of the bacteria. Collaborative institutions includes the University of California San Diego, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the Simons Foundation&#x27;s Flatiron Institute.

===Help Stop TB===
Help Stop TB was launched in March 2016 to help combat tuberculosis, a disease caused by a bacterium that is evolving resistance to currently available treatments. The computations of this project target mycolic acids in the bacterium&#x27;s protective coat, simulating the behaviour of these molecules to better understand how they offer protection to the bacteria.

===Smash Childhood Cancer===
Launched in January 2017, the Smash Childhood Cancer project builds on the work from the Help Fight Childhood Cancer project by looking for drug candidates targeting additional childhood cancers. Upon Dr. Akira Nakagawara&#x27;s retirement in March 2020, the principal investigator changed to Dr. Godfrey Chan, who was one of the original members of the Smash Childhood Cancer team. Additionally, PRDM14 and Fox01 have been added as new targets for investigation. An inhibitor of the osteopontin protein was modeled.

<doc id="1176528" wikidata="Q3548523" url="?curid=1176528" title="Jun Togawa">
<text>is a Japanese singer, musician and actress. She is one of the greatest influences on Japanese avant-garde music and media, and her career spans over 35 years. Her close friends over the years include Susumu Hirasawa. She was mainly active from 1981 to 1995.

==Career==
After gaining attention as a guest singer for the New Wave band Halmens and her acting roles in Japanese dramas and commercials for the Washlet, she began her professional music career in the early 1980s as a singer. She joined former Halmens member Kōji Ueno and artist/lyricist Keiichi Ohta to form the Shōwa era-themed band Guernica in 1981, whose first album was released under YEN Records in 1982. 

In 1984, during a hiatus on Guernica, she released a live album &quot;Ura Tamahime&quot; with a backing band called Yapoos; the band included some former Halmens members and the album featured several covers of Halmens songs. The same year, she released her debut solo album &quot;Tamahime-sama&quot; (also on YEN&quot;),&quot; containing themes of menstruation, womanhood, and romance with a recurring insect and pupa motif. The following year, she came out with album &quot;Kyokuto Ian Shoka&quot; (Far Eastern Comfort Songs) with a backing band called the Jun Togawa Unit. Later that year she released her album &quot;Suki Suki Daisuki,&quot; a satirical take on aidoru music, this time under her own Alfa Records sublabel, HYS.

She joined Yapoos and solidified the group as an official band, releasing their first album in 1987. She did two more albums with Guernica in 1988 and 1989, and continued singing with Yapoos, releasing albums mainly into the mid 90s, then one in 2003 and another in 2019. Generally the differentiation between her self-named bands and the Yapoos has been a greater degree of collaboration in the latter. 

Although she never achieved major pop success, she survived as an influential and respected underground music figure both solo and as the lead singer of Guernica and her most commercial project Yapoos where she is particularly noted for her connection to eroguro culture. 

Notable collaborators over the years include Haruomi Hosono who sponsored Guernica&#x27;s first album and produced &amp; wrote music for some of her earlier works. Her late sister Kyoko Togawa was an actress who at times ventured into the music world and cross collaborated at times. Around 1990 Jun shared management with Susumu Hirasawa resulting in quite a number of collaborations. 

She has acted in the films &quot;Untamagiru&quot; and &quot;The Family Game&quot;.

In 1989, Susumu Hirasawa, who had placed his band P-MODEL on hiatus, joined the Yapoos as support, appearing in the &quot;Bach Studio II&quot; section of the TV program &quot;Yume de Aietara&quot;, where he played in a session with Downtown, Ucchan Nanchan and Susumu Hirasawa.

In 1991, Togawa appeared on the TV Tokyo program &quot;Jun Togawa x Susumu Hirasawa&quot; (MC: Kenzo Saeki) &quot;Jun Togawa Revival Festival!&quot;

In 1992, Susumu Hirasawa offered her &quot;Beals (1992)&quot; as a Yapoos song.

In 1995, &quot;Showa Kyounen&quot; was released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Jun Togawa&#x27;s performing career. Based on the concept of &quot;covering nostalgic melodies of the Showa era,&quot; the album contained six songs arranged by Susumu Hirasawa. The songs include &quot;Ribbon Knight&quot; composed by Isao Tomita and arranged by Susumu Hirasawa.

Her 2004 album, &quot;Togawa Fiction&quot;, with the Jun Togawa Band, featured elements of progressive rock, electropop and other genres. In 2008, she released a career-spanning three-CD boxed set, &quot;Togawa Legend Self Select Best &amp; Rare 1979-2008&quot; which featured many of her most popular songs along with several scarcer tracks and hard to find collaborations.

She marked the 35th anniversary of her professional career in 2016 by releasing new collaboration albums with Vampillia and Hijokaidan, her first new recordings in twelve years.

== The relationship between Jun Togawa and Susumu Hirasawa ==
Jun Togawa and Susumu Hirasawa became close friends as they shared stories about each other&#x27;s past and how they perceived gender and people. They participated in each other&#x27;s tours, and in the 1990s, they worked together on music and gender-related conversations in magazines and on TV. Hirasawa says, &quot;It&#x27;s a difficult task to determine my favorite Jun Togawa song,&quot; referring to one of her masterpieces, &quot;Teinen Pushiganga,&quot; as &quot;that is the god who made God.&quot; Togawa has also covered Hirasawa&#x27;s solo song &quot;Venus&quot; at her own live performances.

<text>In computational complexity theory, a computational problem is complete for a complexity class if it is, in a technical sense, among the &quot;hardest&quot; (or &quot;most expressive&quot;) problems in the complexity class.

More formally, a problem &quot;p&quot; is called hard for a complexity class &quot;C&quot; under a given type of reduction if there exists a reduction (of the given type) from any problem in &quot;C&quot; to &quot;p&quot;. If a problem is both hard for the class and a member of the class, it is complete for that class (for that type of reduction).

A problem that is complete for a class &quot;C&quot; is said to be C-complete, and the class of all problems complete for &quot;C&quot; is denoted C-complete. The first complete class to be defined and the most well known is NP-complete, a class that contains many difficult-to-solve problems that arise in practice. Similarly, a problem hard for a class &quot;C&quot; is called C-hard, e.g. NP-hard.

Normally, it is assumed that the reduction in question does not have higher computational complexity than the class itself. Therefore, it may be said that if a &quot;C-complete&quot; problem has a &quot;computationally easy&quot; solution, then all problems in &quot;C&quot; have an &quot;easy&quot; solution.

Generally, complexity classes that have a recursive enumeration have known complete problems, whereas classes that lack a recursive enumeration have none. For example, NP, co-NP, PLS, PPA all have known natural complete problems.

There are classes without complete problems. For example, Sipser showed that there is a language M such that BPPM (BPP with oracle M) has no complete problems.

<text>The Alicia Patterson Foundation (APF) program was established in 1965 in memory of Alicia Patterson, who was the editor and publisher of &quot;Newsday&quot; for nearly 23 years before her death in 1963.

==Fellowship==
The Foundation provides competitive, one-year or half-year grants to working journalists to pursue independent projects of significant interest and to write articles based on their investigations for &quot;The APF Reporter&quot;, a quarterly magazine published by the Foundation.

The winner gets $40,000 for one year or $20,000 for half a year. They are chosen by an annual competition. Each year a panel of judges convenes in the fall to interview and choose APF fellows.

=== Criteria ===
To get a Fellowship, the journalist must have eight years of professional print experience and must be a full-time worker. Included are reporters, writers, publishers and photographers. 

The competition opens in June and all entries must be postmarked by October 1. Applications are accepted from U.S. citizens who are print journalists with at least five years of professional experience.

<text>The National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) was a private, non-profit organization in the United States that served as a leading proponent for the national child labor reform movement. Its mission was to promote &quot;the rights, awareness, dignity, well-being and education of children and youth as they relate to work and working.&quot;

NCLC, headquartered on Broadway in Manhattan, New York, was administered by a board of directors, with the last chair head being Betsy Brand.

==Formation==

Edgar Gardner Murphy, an American clergyman and author, is credited with proposing the National Child Labor Committee following a conference between Murphy&#x27;s Alabama Child Labor Committee, and the New York Child Labor Committee. The conference culminated on April 25, 1904 at a mass meeting held in Carnegie Hall, New York City. At the meeting, both men and women concerned with the plight of working children overwhelmingly supported the formation of the National Child Labor Committee, and Felix Adler was elected its first Chairman.

The new organization moved swiftly in procuring the support of prominent Americans. In November 1904, barely half a year after its conception, the NCLC boasted the membership of leading politicians, philanthropists, clergymen, and intellectuals including: former president Grover Cleveland, Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, and the president of Harvard University, Charles W. Eliot.

In 1907, the NCLC was chartered by an act of Congress with a board of directors originally including prominent Progressive reformers such as Jane Addams, Florence Kelley, Edward Thomas Devine, Deborah Donalds, and Lillian Wald. With the leadership of such prominent reformers, the organization quickly began to attract additional support and moved towards action and advocacy.

==Exposing child labor==

According to the 1900 US Census, a total of 1,752,187 (about 1 in every 6) children under the age of sixteen were engaged in &quot;gainful occupations&quot; in the United States. This number represents a fifty percent increase from the 1,118,356 children working for wages in 1880. This trend alarmed Americans who, while supporting the traditional role of children in agriculture, found the idea of American youth laboring for meager wages in industrial factories appalling. From 1909 to 1921 the NCLC capitalized on this moral outrage by making it the focal point of the NCLC campaign against child labor.

==Lewis Hine and the National Child Labor Committee==

In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Lewis Hine, a teacher and professional photographer trained in sociology, who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. Over the next ten years Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to pull at the nation&#x27;s heartstrings.

Hine&#x27;s subjects included both boys and girls employed by mills and factories and other occupations all over the United States. For the average American, Hine provided an otherwise unavailable window into the somber working conditions facing America&#x27;s youth. When asked about his work on the subject Hine simply stated that he &quot;wanted to show things that had to be corrected.&quot; Hine&#x27;s work resulted in a wave of popular support for federal child labor regulations put forward by the NCLC. In effect, Hine&#x27;s photographs became the face of the National Child Labor Committee, and are among the earliest examples of documentary photography in America.

Lewis Hine was an influential photo journalist in the years leading up to the First World War. It was during those years that the American economy was doing well, and the need for labor was at an all-time high. Cheap labor was necessary, and American businesses were not only looking for immigrant workers but also child labor as well. The factory-oriented jobs were very specific, and a child was a perfect candidate for the work that was necessary. Their small hands and energy were beneficial to the assembly line.

There was a shift in thinking in the early 1900s towards an end to child labor. The argument from reformers, as they were called, was that child labor was a sick cycle that was inevitably going to end in a future of poverty for the children in the work force. The long hours were robbing children of not only an education but a childhood as well.

Lewis Hine became an investigative photojournalist for the National Child Labor Committee in the early 1900s. Hine took many pictures of workers under the age of 16 in the field. His pictures are the ones that appear in many books on the history of child labor. His photographs were taken in high risk situations in order to capture the negative side of child labor. His photographs also helped make the National Child Labor Committee investigate the child labor that was taking place in many of America&#x27;s factories. &quot;Hine was clever enough to bluff his way into many plants. He searched where he was not welcome, snapped scenes that were meant to be hidden from the public. At times, he was in real danger, risking physical attack when factory managers realized what he was up to…he put his life in the line in order to record a truthful picture of working children in early twentieth-century America&quot;. Today, there is a Lewis Hine award that awards 10 honorees in their outstanding work in servicing young people. Each winner wins 1,000 dollars and a trip to New York to attend the awards ceremony.

==Fighting against child labor==

Immediately after its conception in 1904, the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) began advocating for child labor reform on the state level. A number of state- centered campaigns were organized by the NCLC&#x27;s two regional leaders, Owen Lovejoy in the northern states and Alexander McKelway in the southern states. Both Lovejoy and McKelway actively organized investigations of child labor conditions and lobbied state legislatures for labor regulations.

Although the NCLC made some strides in the north, by 1907, McKelway and the NCLC had achieved little success in enlisting the support of the southern people and had failed to pass any far-reaching reforms in the south&#x27;s important mill states. Consequently, the NCLC decided to refocus its state-by-state attack on child labor and endorsed the first national anti-child labor bill, introduced to congress by Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana in 1907. Although the bill was later defeated, it convinced many opponents of child labor that a solution lay in the cooperation and solidarity between the states.

In response, the NCLC called for the establishment of a federal children&#x27;s bureau that would investigate and report on the circumstances of all American children. In 1912 the NCLC succeeded in passing an act establishing a United States Children&#x27;s Bureau in the Department of Commerce and Labor. On April 9 President William Taft signed the act into law, and over the next thirty years the Children&#x27;s Bureau would work closely with the NCLC to promote child labor reforms on both the state and national level.

In 1915, the NCLC, facing the varied success and inherent limitations of its efforts at the state level, decided to move its efforts to the federal level. On its behalf, Pennsylvania Congressman A Mitchell Palmer (later Attorney General) introduced a bill to end child labor in most American mines and factories. President Wilson found it constitutionally unsound and after the House voted 232 to 44 in favor on February 15, 1915, he allowed it to die in the Senate. Nevertheless, Arthur Link has called it &quot;a turning point in American constitutional history&quot; because it attempted to establish for the first time &quot;the use of the Commerce Clause commerce power to justify almost any form of federal control over working conditions and wages.&quot;

In 1916, Senator Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma and Representative Edward Keating of Colorado introduced the NCLC backed Keating-Owen Act which prohibited shipment in interstate commerce of goods manufactured or processed by child labor. The bill passed by a margin of 337 to 46 in the House and 50 to 12 in the Senate and was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson as the centerpiece of The New Freedom Program. However, in 1918 the law was deemed unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in a five-to-four decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart. The court, although acknowledging child labor as a social evil, felt that the Keating-Owen Act overstepped congress&#x27; power to regulate trade. The bill was immediately revised and again deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

The NCLC then switched its strategy to passing of a federal constitutional amendment. In 1924 Congress passed the Child Labor Amendment with a vote of 297 to 69 (with 64 abstaining) in the house and 61 to 23 (12 abstaining) in the senate. However, by 1932 only six states had voted for ratification, while twenty-four had rejected the measure. Today, the amendment is technically still-pending and has been ratified by a total of twenty-eight states, requiring the ratification of ten more for its incorporation into the Constitution.

In 1938 the National Child Labor Committee threw its support behind the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) which included child labor provisions designed by the NCLC. The act prohibits any interstate commerce of goods produced through oppressive child labor. The act defines &quot;oppressive child labor&quot; as any form of employment for children under age sixteen and any particularly hazardous occupation for children ages sixteen to eighteen. This definition excludes agricultural labor and instances in which the child is employed by his or her guardians. On June 25, 1938, after the approval of Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill into law; the FLSA remains the primary federal child labor law to this day.

For the entirety of World War II, the NCLC served as a watchdog to ensure that employment shortages caused by the war did not weaken the newly passed and implemented child labor laws, and that children were not drawn back into the mines, mills and streets.

==Promoting vocational skills and workplace education==

After WWII, the National Child Labor Committee significantly broadened its scope of involvement by placing a new emphasis on the importance of educating children about the working world as well as advocating programs designed to advance the education and health of migrant farmworkers throughout America. Today the NCLC&#x27;s four main goals include:
* Educating children about the world of work
* Preventing the exploitation of children and youth in the labor market
* Improving the health and education opportunities for the children of the migrant farmworkers
* Increasing public awareness of the work done day-in and day-out on behalf of the nation&#x27;s children

During the 1950s and 60s the NCLC advocated and contributed to the various bills including the Manpower Development and Training Act, the Economic Opportunity Act and the Vocational Education Act.

In 1979 NCLC collaborated with the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America to found the National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC). The NYEC was formed in order to provide support to organizations that help youth become productive private citizens. The NCLC provided the original housing for the NYEC and shared an Executive Director from 1983-1987.

In 1985 the NCLC introduced the Lewis Hine Awards for Service to Children and Youth, which honor unheralded Americans for their work with young people, and give special awards to better-known leaders for their extraordinary efforts. Over the past two decades the awards have developed into an annual event of national notoriety with awards given out to a diverse range of professionals and volunteers. Some past recipients include Gene Bowen of Warwick, New York, in 2008 who co-founded Road Recovery, a clinically acclaimed skills program designed for teens recovering from drug addiction and Stacy Maciuk of Brentwood, Tennessee in 2007 for her relentless advocacy of kids in foster care and organizing a suitcase collection drive to provide foster children with a place to pack their clothes and possessions other than a garbage bag.

From 1991 to today, the National Child Labor Committee created and expanded the Kids and the Power of Work (KAPOW) program. KAPOW exists as a network of private business and elementary school partnerships which introduces students to the world of work through lessons taught by private sector volunteers. Today, KAPOW serves as a model for similar programs, runs operations in over thirty communities from Florida to California, and serves over 50,000 students.

==Demise==
During its final years fundraising failed to produce the income it needed, and it finally ran out of money. The social ill it had been funded to combat, had ended. The NCLC is a rare example of an organization which succeeded in its mission and was no longer needed. After more than a century of fighting child labor—in fields, in sweatshops, and in well-known corporations—it shut down in 2017. There was no announcement of its end. Jeffrey Newman, the last president of the New York-based committee, said the NCLC board decided to &quot;declare victory and just move out.&quot;

The history of Zacharo begins in the middle of the 19th century. At the time of the Greek War of Independence, the area of Zacharo was sparsely populated. However, in the decades that followed, populations from the villages of the surrounding mountains started to migrate to the area. The town allegedly took its name from an inn, that belonged to a woman named Zacharoula. In 1881 Zacharo was officially proclaimed a community. In late August 2007, forest fires caused over 40 deaths, as well as extensive property damage. Zacharo was one of the worst-hit areas in Greece.

==Economy==

The economy of Zacharo relies on tourism as well as on agriculture. The pleasant Mediterranean climate, long Zacharo beach, the Kaiafas Lake, the Thermal Springs of Kaiafas and the adjacent Lapithas mountain draw many tourists, especially in summer. The agricultural sector is also a major source of income for the local economy. It is based on the cultivation of olive trees, for the production of olive oil. The variety of olive tree which prevails in the area is the Koroneiki, which is one of the most distinguished in Greece. The olive oil produced is of extra-virgin quality and is mostly exported to the international market. The Zacharo tomato is famed for its sweetness. When ripe, it is loaded with sugars (mainly fructose and inulin) to the extent that the sugar crystals are visible to the naked eye. Cultivation of the Zacharo tomato is all but extinct, as the cultivar does not grow well in greenhouses, has a short season, and its extreme fleshiness makes the fruit heavy and liable to squeezing and decay when packed.

<doc id="1176563" wikidata="Q4774361" url="?curid=1176563" title="Anti-foundationalism">
<text>Anti-foundationalism (also called nonfoundationalism) is any philosophy which rejects a foundationalist approach. An anti-foundationalist is one who does not believe that there is some fundamental belief or principle which is the basic ground or foundation of inquiry and knowledge.

Anti-foundationalism can be metaphysical (positing a ground of being or metaphysical foundation), ethical (positing some value or virtue as fundamental), epistemological (i.e. the foundationalist theory of justification) or apply to some other field with foundationalist theories.

==Anti-essentialism==

Anti-foundationalists use logical or historical or genealogical attacks on foundational concepts (see especially Nietzsche and Foucault), often coupled with alternative methods for justifying and forwarding intellectual inquiry, such as the pragmatic subordination of knowledge to practical action. Foucault dismissed the search for a return to origins as Platonic essentialism, preferring to stress the contingent nature of human practices.

Anti-foundationalists oppose metaphysical methods. Moral and ethical anti-foundationalists are often criticized for moral relativism, but anti-foundationalists often dispute this charge, offering alternative methods of moral thought that they claim do not require foundations. Thus while Charles Taylor accused Foucault of having &quot;no order of human life, or way we are, or human nature, that one can appeal to in order to judge or evaluate between ways of life&quot;, Foucault nevertheless insists on the need for continuing ethical enquiry &quot;without&quot; any universal system to appeal to.

Niklas Luhmann used cybernetics to challenge the role of foundational unities and canonical certainties.

==Totalisation and legitimation==

Anti-foundationalists oppose totalising visions of social, scientific or historical reality, considering them to lack legitimation, and preferring local narratives instead. No social totality but a multitude of local and concrete practices; &quot;not &quot;a&quot; history but at best histories&quot;. In such neopragmatism, there is no overall truth, merely an ongoing process of better and more fruitful methods of edification. Even our most taken-for-granted categories for social analysis—of gender, sex, race, and class—are considered by anti-essentialists like Marjorie Garber as social constructs.

==Hope and fear==

Stanley Fish distinguishes between what he calls &quot;antifoundationalist theory hope&quot; and &quot;antifoundationalist theory fear&quot;—finding them however both equally illusory. 

Fear of the corrosive effects of antifoundationalism was widespread in the late twentieth century, anticipating such things as a cultural meltdown and moral anarchy, or (at the least) a loss of the necessary critical distance to allow for leverage against the status quo. For Fish, however, the threat of a loss of objective standards of rational enquiry with the disappearance of any founding principle was a false fear: far from opening the way to an unbridled subjectivity, antifoundationalism leaves the individual firmly entrenched within the conventional context and standards of enquiry/dispute of the discipline/profession/habitus within which s/he is irrevocably placed.

By the same token, however, the antifoundationalist &quot;hope&quot; of escaping local situations through awareness of the contingency of all such situations—through recognition of the conventional/rhetorical nature of all claims to master principles—that hope is to Fish equally foredoomed by the very nature of the situational consciousness, the all-embracing social and intellectual context, in which every individual is separately enclosed.

Fish has also noted how, in contradistinction to hopes of an emancipatory outcome from antifoundationalism, anti-essentialist theories arguing for the absence of a transcontextual point of reference have been put to conservative and neo-conservative, as well as progressive, ends. Thus, for example, John Searle has offered an account of the construction of social reality fully compatible with the acceptance stance of &quot;the man who is at home in his society, the man who is &quot;chez lui&quot; in the social institutions of the society...as comfortable as the fish in the sea&quot;.
==Criticism==
Anti-foundationalists have been criticised for attacking all general claims &quot;except&quot; their own; for offering a localizing rhetoric contradicted in practice by their own globalizing style.

Edward Said condemned radical anti-foundationalism for excessive cultural relativism and overdependence on the linguistic turn at the expense of human realities.

<doc id="1176568" wikidata="Q6972293" url="?curid=1176568" title="National Digital Newspaper Program">
<text>The National Digital Newspaper Program is a joint project between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress to create and maintain a publicly available, online digital archive of historically significant newspapers published in the United States between 1836 and 1922. Additionally, the program will make available bibliographic records and holdings information for some 140,000 newspaper titles from the 17th century to the present. Further, it will include scope notes and encyclopedia-style entries discussing the historical significance of specific newspapers. Added content will also include contextually relevant historical information. &quot;One organization within each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with relevant state partners in this effort.&quot; 

In March 2007 more than 226,000 pages of newspapers from California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Utah, Virginia and the District of Columbia published between 1900 and 1910 were put online at a fully searchable site called &quot;Chronicling America.&quot; the total number of pages is about 413,000. This further expanded to be 1 million pages in 2009.

Funding through the National Endowment for the Humanities is carried out through their &quot;We The People&quot; initiative.

== Purpose ==
This project dovetails with the United States Newspaper Program which was a massive project to microfilm newspaper collections. The initiators of that earlier project asserted that the intellectual content of newspapers serves an important role for researchers as it is for all intents and purposes the first draft of history. Newspapers also provide unique access to &quot;diverse geographic viewpoints at the community level.&quot; Problematically, since the middle of the 19th century this &quot;first draft&quot; has been recorded on poor quality newsprint which is decaying rapidly. This digitization project&#x27;s purpose is to continue preserving newspaper and newspaper collections while addressing the inadequacies of the prior program. Through digitization, it is more likely that images will be copied with fidelity and that the records will be more richly searchable. This latter point is huge as newspapers traditionally posed a research challenge due to density of text and inadequate cataloging of content.

== History ==
On March 31, 2004, Bruce Cole, the directory of the NEH, and James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, signed an agreement creating the National Digital Newspaper Program. The NDNP follows in the footsteps of the successful United States Newspaper Program, a several-decade effort to catalog and microfilm the bulk of America&#x27;s historic newspapers. The program is broken down into two phases. Each successive phase will both increase the scope of the program and refine the requirements for data collection.

=== Phase 1 ===
In July 2004 the award guidelines were issued. Applications were due in October and awardees were announced the following March. The first phase took newspapers from a small subset of the states, limited to 1900 through 1910. After using this phase to improve technical requirements and specifications, the program was opened to other awardees in Phase 2.

The awardees for Phase 1 are:
* University of California, Riverside
* University of Florida Libraries, Gainesville
* University of Kentucky Libraries, Lexington
* New York Public Library, New York City
* University of Utah, Salt Lake City
* Library of Virginia, Richmond

The General-access Phase 1 website prototype was implemented in March 2007 and that May it was announced that phase 1 was completed.

=== Phase 2 ===
Phase 2 of NDNP expanded grants to an additional group of institutions. Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 included the following institutions:

* Arizona State Library, Archives and Records Management
* University of Hawaii
* Minnesota Historical Society
* University of Nebraska, Lincoln
* University of North Texas
* Ohio Historical Society, Columbus
* Pennsylvania State University
* State Historical Society of Missouri
* Washington State Library

== Program Technology ==
Participants must follow the technical guidelines laid out in a 64-page PDF. The technology for the NDNP digital repository is being built using largely open source software, including:

* Apache Cocoon
* Apache Lucene
* Gentoo Linux
* Fedora
Digital objects are stored in .TIFF 6.0, .JPEG 2000, and .PDF formats. Metadata is provided in the METS/MODS version of XML and XML provides the basis for larger hierarchical structures as well.

== Alternatives ==
The scanning efforts of the government entity have been dwarfed by newspapers.com and newspaperarchive.com which as of March 2018 claim to each have scanned more than 350 million pages. Publishers, libraries and historical organizations find the private sector faster, less complicated and cheaper than the National Digital Newspaper Program. Both private organizations charge readers to read, but do not charge publishers to scan items.

<doc id="1176581" wikidata="Q579152" url="?curid=1176581" title="RL (complexity)">
<text>Randomized Logarithmic-space (RL), sometimes called RLP (Randomized Logarithmic-space Polynomial-time), is the complexity class of computational complexity theory problems solvable in logarithmic space and polynomial time with probabilistic Turing machines with one-sided error. It is named in analogy with RP, which is similar but has no logarithmic space restriction.

==Definition==
The probabilistic Turing machines in the definition of RL never accept incorrectly but are allowed to reject incorrectly less than 1/3 of the time; this is called &quot;one-sided error&quot;. The constant 1/3 is arbitrary; any &quot;x&quot; with 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1 would suffice. This error can be made 2−&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) times smaller for any polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) without using more than polynomial time or logarithmic space by running the algorithm repeatedly.

==Relation to other complexity classes==
Sometimes the name RL is reserved for the class of problems solvable by logarithmic-space probabilistic machines in &quot;unbounded&quot; time. However, this class can be shown to be equal to NL using a probabilistic counter, and so is usually referred to as NL instead; this also shows that RL is contained in NL. RL is contained in BPL, which is similar but allows two-sided error (incorrect accepts). RL contains L, the problems solvable by deterministic Turing machines in log space, since its definition is just more general.

Noam Nisan showed in 1992 the weak derandomization result that RL is contained in SC, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time and polylogarithmic space on a deterministic Turing machine; in other words, given &quot;polylogarithmic&quot; space, a deterministic machine can simulate &quot;logarithmic&quot; space probabilistic algorithms.

It is believed that RL is equal to L, that is, that polynomial-time logspace computation can be completely derandomized; major evidence for this was presented by Reingold et al. in 2005. A proof of this is the holy grail of the efforts in the field of unconditional derandomization of complexity classes. A major step forward was Omer Reingold&#x27;s proof that SL is equal to L.

<text>480p is the shorthand name for a family of video display resolutions. The p stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The &quot;480&quot; denotes a vertical resolution of 480 pixels, usually with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels and 4:3 aspect ratio ( 640) or a horizontal resolution of 854 (848 should be used for mod16 compatibility) pixels for an approximate 16:9 aspect ratio ( 853.). Since a pixel count must be a whole number, in Wide VGA displays it is generally rounded up to 854 to ensure inclusion of the entire image. The frames are displayed progressively as opposed to interlaced. 480p was used for many early plasma televisions. Standard definition has always been a 4:3 aspect ratio with a pixel resolution of at 60 Hz for NTSC regions, and 720 or for PAL regions (1024 wide for widescreen displays). However, standard definition defines a 15.7k Hz horizontal scanrate, which means that interlacing has to be used for those resolution modes. The lowercase letter &quot;p&quot; in 480p stands for progressive, so the two must not be confused.

== ATSC progressive mode standards ==
The ATSC digital television standards define 480p with 640×480p (4:3) pixel resolutions, at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. 

When 480p30 is broadcast on air, it is frame doubled then interlaced to 480i60. In case of 480p24, it is processed using the 3:2 pulldown technique to 480i60. In both cases the spatial resolution doesn&#x27;t change, but the conversion to a interlaced format allows a direct digital to analog conversion for eventual broadcast on the analog television network.

<text>720p (720 lines progressive) is a progressive HD signal format with 720 horizontal lines/1280 columns and an aspect ratio (AR) of 16:9, normally known as widescreen HD (1.78:1). All major HD broadcasting standards (such as SMPTE 292M) include a 720p format, which has a resolution of 1280×720.

The number &quot;720&quot; stands for the 720 horizontal scan lines of image display resolution (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution). The &quot;p&quot; stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. When broadcast at 60 frames per second, 720p features the highest temporal resolution possible under the ATSC and DVB standards. The term assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, thus implying a resolution of 1280×720 px (0.9 megapixels).

720i (720 lines interlaced) is an erroneous term found in numerous sources and publications. Typically, it is a typographical error in which the author is referring to the 720p HDTV format. However, in some cases it is incorrectly presented as an actual alternative format to 720p. No proposed or existing broadcast standard permits 720 &quot;interlaced&quot; lines in a video frame at any frame rate.

== Comparison with interlace scanning ==
Progressive scanning reduces the need to prevent flicker by anti-aliasing single high contrast horizontal lines. It is also easier to perform high-quality 50↔60 Hz conversion and slow-motion clips with progressive video.

<doc id="1176599" wikidata="Q97413" url="?curid=1176599" title="Albin Grau">
<text>Albin Grau (December 22, 1884 in Leipzig-Schönefeld – March 27, 1971) was a German artist, architect and occultist, and the producer and production designer for F.W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922). He was largely responsible for the look and spirit of the film, including the sets, costumes, storyboards and promotional materials.

A lifelong student of the occult and member of Fraternitas Saturni, under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue &quot;Nosferatu&quot; with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled with Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok&#x27;s verminous and emaciated look. Grau claimed to had originally gotten the idea of shooting a vampire film while serving in the German Army during World War I, when a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the Undead, though this story may have been fabricated to promote the film.

Before Grau and Murnau collaborated on &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, which was shot in 1921, Grau was planning to create several movies devoted to the occult and supernatural through his studio, Prana Film. Since &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was a loose and unauthorized translation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; Prana had to declare bankruptcy in order to evade infringement lawsuits. This made &quot;Nosferatu&quot; its one and only release.

==The Weida Conference==

In 1925 Grau participated in the Weida Conference, an international meeting of occult leaders at Hohenleuben, along with his lodge secretary Eugen Grosche (Frater Gregorius), Master of the Danzig Lodge, Otto Gebhardi (Frater Ich will), Gebhardi&#x27;s lover Martha Kuntzel (Soror Ich will es), Heinrich Tranker (as Frater Recnartus, head of the Rosicrucian occult lodge Collegium Pansophicum, aka Pansophic Orient Lodge, Berlin) and his wife Helen, and Aleister Crowley with his entourage of Leah Hirsig, Dorothy Olsen, and Norman Mudd. Grau shot a film of the conference, currently lost. The conference was not a smooth event and Traenker withdrew his support of Crowley. The differences between Traenker and Crowley led to a schism in the Pansophical Lodge between the brothers who disagreed with Crowley and those who accepted Crowley&#x27;s Law of Thelema, including Gregorius and Grau. Following these differences the Pansophical Lodge would be officially closed in 1926. Those brothers of the Pansophia Lodge who accepted the teachings of Crowley would join Grosche in founding the Fraternitas Saturni.

Pacitius (Grau) gave up all his lodge titles, refusing the invitation to head the new order, and left the Master&#x27;s Chair of the Fraternitas Saturni, Orient Berlin, to Eugen Grosche, who would lead it as Master Gregorius into the new Aquarian/Saturnian age. Grau contributed fascinating, if mathematically obscure, articles on sacred geometry to &quot;Saturn Gnosis&quot;, the periodical of the Fraternitas Saturni (five issues between July 1928 and March 1930).

==Later years==

After Fraternitas Saturni was prohibited in 1936 by the Nazi regime, Albin Grau was threatened with persecution but managed to emigrate to Switzerland.

After the war, he returned to Germany and pursued a career in commercial art and lived in the Alpine village of Bayrischzell, Upper Bavaria, until his death in 1971. Bayrischzell honours him to this day.

==In popular culture==

Albin Grau was one of the main characters in the fictionalized movie account of the filming of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, titled &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; (2000), directed by American filmmaker E. Elias Merhige. He was played by Udo Kier.

In the 2024 &quot;Nosferatu&quot; remake, the name of Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz (a counterpart to Van Helsing) is a reference to Grau.

<doc id="1176603" wikidata="Q168614" url="?curid=1176603" title="1080i">
<text>1080i is a term used in high-definition television (HDTV) and video display technology. It means a video mode with 1080 lines of vertical resolution. The &quot;i&quot; stands for interlaced scanning method. This format was once a standard in HDTV. It was particularly used for broadcast television. This is because it can deliver high-resolution images without needing excessive bandwidth. This format is used in the SMPTE 292M standard.

== Definition ==
The number &quot;1080&quot; in 1080i refers to the number of horizontal lines that make up the vertical resolution of the display. Each of these lines contributes to the overall detail and clarity of the image. The letter &quot;i&quot; stands for interlaced. This is a technique where the image is not displayed all at once. Instead, the frame is split into two fields. One field contains the odd-numbered lines, and the other field contains the even-numbered lines. These fields are displayed in rapid succession, giving the appearance of a full image to the human eye. The interlacing technique was developed to improve the motion portrayal of images without doubling the required bandwidth. This is particularly useful in broadcasting, where bandwidth efficiency is crucial. The frame rate is typically 50 or 60 fields per second, depending on the region. This effectively means 25 or 30 frames per second when the fields are combined.

== Comparison with 1080p ==
A key difference between 1080i and 1080p is how the lines of resolution are displayed. Both offer 1920x1080 pixels, but the display method is different. In 1080p, the &quot;p&quot; stands for progressive scan. Each frame is drawn line by line, from top to bottom, creating a complete image in a single pass. This results in a sharper and more stable picture, especially in fast-moving scenes. On the other hand, 1080i uses an interlaced method. The two fields that make up a frame are captured at slightly different times, leading to a misalignment in fast-moving parts of the image. This can cause artifacts like &quot;combing,&quot; where fast-moving objects appear to have a serrated edge. However, 1080i has been preferred in broadcast television due to its lower bandwidth requirements, making it more efficient for over-the-air or cable transmission.

== Historical context ==
The origins of 1080i can be traced from Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding, a Japanese analog high-definition television system. 1080i emerged as a leading standard for HDTV broadcasts. Many broadcasters worldwide adopted it. The ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) standards and the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) standards allowed for the transmission of 1080i video signals. The adoption of 1080i was particularly significant in sports broadcasting. The higher resolution allowed for more detail and clarity, especially in large stadium shots and fast-paced action. The format&#x27;s efficiency in utilizing available bandwidth made it a practical choice for broadcasters. However, it required more complex processing on the receiving end to deinterlace the image for display on progressive-scan screens. Overall, 1080i played a crucial role in the early days of HDTV. It bridged the gap between standard-definition broadcasts and the high-definition future that would soon become the norm. While its use has diminished with the rise of 1080p and 4K resolutions, 1080i remains an important milestone in the evolution of television technology.

== Technical overview ==

=== Resolution ===
The core of 1080i is its resolution. The resolution is 1920x1080 pixels. This means that each video frame has 1,920 pixels horizontally and 1,080 pixels vertically. This results in over two million individual pixels per frame. This high resolution is why 1080i is called &quot;high-definition&quot;. It offers a significant improvement over standard-definition formats, which typically have much lower pixel counts. The 1920x1080 resolution allows for greater detail and clarity in images. This makes it ideal for larger screens where higher pixel density is essential to maintain image quality. The increased resolution is particularly noticeable in fine details such as textures, text, and intricate patterns. These can be rendered with much greater accuracy than in lower-resolution formats.

=== Interlacing ===
The &quot;i&quot; in 1080i stands for interlaced. This refers to how each video frame is displayed. Instead of showing the entire frame at once, the interlacing technique divides each frame into two separate fields. The first field contains all the odd-numbered lines (1, 3, 5, etc.), and the second field contains all the even-numbered lines (2, 4, 6, etc.). These two fields are displayed one after the other. The odd lines are shown first, followed by the even lines. This happens very quickly, around 50 or 60 fields per second. The human eye sees these two fields as a single, continuous image. The main advantage of interlacing is that it allows for a higher frame rate without needing more bandwidth. This results in smoother motion, especially for content with moderate to fast movement, like sports broadcasts. However, interlacing also has some drawbacks. Since the two fields are captured at slightly different times, fast-moving objects can appear misaligned between the two fields. This creates a visual artifact called &quot;combing.&quot; This can reduce image quality, especially in scenes with a lot of motion. Modern display devices often use deinterlacing algorithms to combine the two fields into a single progressive image before displaying it.

=== Frame rate ===
The frame rate of 1080i is usually 50 or 60 Hz. It depends on the region. In areas using the PAL or SECAM standards, like Europe and parts of Asia, the frame rate is 50 Hz. In regions using NTSC, like North America and Japan, the frame rate is 60 Hz. The frame rate refers to how often a new field is shown per second. At 50 Hz, 50 fields are shown each second. This results in 25 full frames per second when the odd and even fields are combined. At 60 Hz, 60 fields are shown per second. This results in 30 full frames per second. Interlacing affects how motion is perceived in 1080i. Since each field represents a slightly different moment in time, motion can appear smoother compared to lower frame rate progressive scans. However, this also means 1080i can struggle with fast-moving scenes. The interlaced fields might not perfectly align, leading to motion artifacts. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) prefers to use the resolution and &quot;frame rate&quot; (not field rate) separated by a slash, as in &quot;1080i/30&quot; and &quot;1080i/25&quot;, likewise 480i/30 and 576i/25. Resolutions of 1080i60 or 1080i50 often refers to 1080i/30 or 1080i/25 in EBU notation.

=== Signal transmission ===
The 1080i video signals can be carried by four main digital television broadcast systems: ATSC, DVB, ISDB and DTMB. In both ATSC and DVB systems, the 1080i signal is compressed using codecs like MPEG-2 or H.264 to reduce the bandwidth required for transmission.

In the United States, 1080i is the preferred format for most broadcasters, with Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, and Comcast owned networks broadcasting in the format, along with most smaller broadcasters. Only Fox- and Disney-owned television networks, along with MLB Network and a few other cable networks, use 720p as the preferred format for their networks; A&amp;E Networks channels converted from 720p to 1080i sometime in 2013 due to acquired networks already transmitting in the 1080i format. Many ABC affiliates owned by Hearst Television and former Belo Corporation stations owned by Tegna, along with some individual affiliates of those three networks, air their signals in 1080i and upscale network programming for master control and transmission purposes, as most syndicated programming and advertising is produced and distributed in 1080i/p, removing a downscaling step to 720p. This also allows local newscasts on these ABC affiliates to be produced in the higher resolution (especially for weather forecasting presentation purposes for map clarity) to match the picture quality of their 1080i competitors.

<text>480i is the video mode used for standard-definition digital video in the Caribbean, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Myanmar, Western Sahara, and most of the Americas (with the exception of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay). The other common standard definition digital standard, used in the rest of the world, is 576i.

It originated from the need for a standard to digitize analog 525 line TV (defined in BT.601) and is now used for digital TV broadcasts and home appliances such as game consoles and DVD disc players.

The &quot;480&quot; identifies a vertical resolution of 480 lines, and the &quot;i&quot; identifies it as an interlaced resolution. The field rate, which is 60 Hz (or 59.94 Hz when used with NTSC color), is sometimes included when identifying the video mode, i.e. 480i60; another notation, endorsed by both the International Telecommunication Union in BT.601 and SMPTE in SMPTE 259M, includes the frame rate, as in 480i/30.

Although related, it should not be confused with the analog &quot;525 lines&quot; resolution, mandated by CCIR Systems M and J and usually paired with NTSC color. This association explains why 480i is sometimes inaccurately called &quot;NTSC&quot;, even though NTSC only exists in the analog domain.

== Technical details ==
For analog NTSC, there are a total of 525 scanning lines per frame of which originally 483 lines were visible (241.5 visible lines per field + 21 lines of vertical blanking per field = 483 + 42 = 525 lines per frame) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). [For quad video recording systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.]

A full frame consists of two fields. One field contains the odd-numbered lines and the other contains the even ones. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five equalizing pulses (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems, including Systems A (405-line) and E (819-line) even though they had no equalizing pulses, on the first equalizing pulse following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video at the end of the even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a scanning line (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.

For DV-NTSC only 480 lines are used. The digitally transmitted horizontal resolution is usually 720 samples (which includes 16 samples for the horizontal sync and horizontal blanking) or 704 visible pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 (with vertically rectangular pixels) and therefore a display resolution of 640 × 480 (VGA); that is standard-definition television (SDTV) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (with square pixels).

The field rate (not the frame rate) is usually (60/1.001) = 59.94 hertz for color TV and is often incorrectly rounded up to 60 Hz. There are several conventions for written shorthands for the combination of resolution and rate: 480i60, 480i/30 (EBU/SMPTE always use frame rate to specify interlaced formats) and 480/60i. 480i is usually used in countries that conventionally use NTSC (most of the Americas and Japan), because the 525 transmitted lines at 60 hertz of analogue NTSC contain 480 visible ones.

In each case of the use of the ‘60’ terminology, it is merely shorthand for 59.94, to differentiate it from 30 (29.97) or 24 (23.976).

Color information is stored using the YCbCr color space (different from NTSC that used YIQ) with 4:2:2 sampling (also different from NTSC) and following Rec. 601 colorimetry.

480i can be transported by all major digital television formats (ATSC, DVB and ISDB) and on DVD.

<doc id="1176614" wikidata="Q425068" url="?curid=1176614" title="Granzyme">
<text>Granzymes are serine proteases released by cytoplasmic granules within cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. They induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the target cell, thus eliminating cells that have become cancerous or are infected with viruses or bacteria. Granzymes also kill bacteria and inhibit viral replication. In NK cells and T cells, granzymes are packaged in cytotoxic granules along with perforin. Granzymes can also be detected in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex, and the trans-golgi reticulum. The contents of the cytotoxic granules function to permit entry of the granzymes into the target cell cytosol. The granules are released into an immune synapse formed with a target cell, where perforin mediates the delivery of the granzymes into endosomes in the target cell, and finally into the target cell cytosol. Granzymes are part of the serine esterase family. They are closely related to other immune serine proteases expressed by innate immune cells, such as neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G.

Granzyme B activates apoptosis by activating caspases (especially caspase-3), which cleaves many substrates, including caspase-activated DNase to execute cell death. Granzyme B also cleaves the protein Bid, which recruits the proteins Bax and Bak to change the membrane permeability of the mitochondria, causing the release of cytochrome c (which is one of the parts needed to activate caspase-9 via the apoptosome), Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 (which suppress the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)), among other proteins. Granzyme B also cleaves many of the proteins responsible for apoptosis in the absence of caspase activity. The other granzymes activate cell death by caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms.

In addition to killing their target cells, granzymes can target and kill intracellular pathogens. Granzymes A and B induce lethal oxidative damage in bacteria by cleaving components of the electron transport chain, while granzyme B cleaves viral proteins to inhibit viral activation and replication. The granzymes bind directly to the nucleic acids DNA and RNA; this enhances their cleavage of nucleic acid binding proteins.

More recently, in addition to T lymphocytes, granzymes have been shown to be expressed in other types of immune cells such as dendritic cells, B cells and mast cells. In addition, granzymes may also be expressed in non-immune cells such as keratinocytes, pneumocytes and chondrocytes. As many of these cell types either do not express perforin or do not form immunological synapses, granzyme B is released extracellularly. Extracellular granzyme B can accumulate in the extracellular space in diseases associated with dysregulated or chronic inflammation leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and impaired tissue healing and remodelling. Extracellular granzyme B has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, aneurysm, vascular leakage, chronic wound healing, and skin aging.

==History==

In 1986 Jürg Tschopp and his group published a paper on their discovery of granzymes. In the paper they discussed how they purified, characterized and discovered a variety of granzymes found within cytolytic granules that were carried by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Jürg was able to identify 8 different granzymes and discovered partial amino acid sequences for each. The molecules were unofficially named Grs for five years before Jürg and his team came up with the name granzymes which was widely accepted by the scientific community.

Granzyme secretion can be detected and measured using Western Blot or ELISA techniques. Granzyme secreting cells can be identified and quantified by flow cytometry or ELISPOT. Alternatively, granzyme activity can be assayed by virtue of their protease activity.

==Other functions==

In Cullen&#x27;s paper “Granzymes in Cancer and Immunity” he discusses how granzyme A has been known to be found in elevated levels within patients who currently have an infectious disease and/or in a pro-inflammatory state. Granzymes have also been found to help initiate the inflammatory response. “For example, rheumatoid arthritis patients have increased levels of granzyme A in the synovial fluid of swollen joints”. When granzymes are in an extracellular state they have the ability to activate macrophages and mast cells to initiate the inflammatory response. The interaction between the granzymes and somatic cells are still unexplainable but advances in understanding the process are being made constantly. Other granzymes like granzyme K have been found in high levels of patients who have gone septic. Granzyme H has been found to have a direct correlation with patients who have a viral infection. Scientists are able to conclude that granzyme H specializes in detecting ‘proteolytic degradation’ which is found in viral proteins.

Cullen further states in his paper that granzymes may have a role in immunomodulation, or the job of maintaining homeostasis in the immune system during an infection. “In humans, loss of perforin function leads to a syndrome called familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis […]”. This syndrome can lead to death because both T cells and macrophages multiply to fight the pathogen, resulting in harmful levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The overactivation can lead to inflammation of vital organs, anemia via overactivated macrophages phagocytosing blood cells, and can potentially be fatal.

In Trapani&#x27;s paper he talks about how granzymes may have other functions, in addition to their ability to fight off infection. Granzyme A contains certain chemicals that allow it to cause proliferation in B cells to reduce the chance of cancer growth and formation. Test on mice have shown that granzyme A and B might not have a direct link to controlling viral infections, but helping accelerate the immune systems response.

==In cancer research==

In Cullen&#x27;s paper “Granzymes in Cancer and Immunity” he describes the process of “immune surveillance [as] the process whereby precancerous and malignant cells are recognized by the immune system as damaged and are consequently targeted for elimination”. For a tumor to progress it requires conditions within the body and surrounding area to be growth-promoting. Almost all people have suitable immune cells to fight off tumors in the body. Studies have shown that the immune system even has the ability to prevent precancerous cells from growing and arbitrate the regression of established tumors. The dangerous thing about cancer cells is they have the ability to inhibit the function of the immune system. Although a tumor may be in its beginning stage and very weak, it may be giving off chemicals that inhibit the function of the immune system allowing it to grow and become harmful. Tests have shown that mice without granzymes and perforins are at high risk to have tumors spread throughout their body.

Tumors have the ability to escape from immune surveillance by secreting immunosuppressive TGF-β. This inhibits proliferation and activation of T cells. TGF-β production is the most potent mechanism of immune avoidance used by tumors. TGF-β inhibits expression of five different cytotoxic genes including perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme B, which then inhibits T cell-mediated tumor clearance.

Perforin&#x27;s role in protecting the body against lymphoma was emphasized when scientists discovered that p53 did not have as big of a role in lymphoma surveillance as its counterpart perforin. Perforin and granzymes have been found to have a directly related ability to protect the body against the formation of different kinds of lymphomas.

<doc id="1176619" wikidata="Q1239061" url="?curid=1176619" title="Home Guard (Denmark)">
<text>The Danish Home Guard () (HJV) is the fourth service of the Danish Armed Forces. It was formerly concerned only with the defence of Danish territory, but since 2006, it has also supported the Danish military efforts in Afghanistan and Kosovo. The Danish Home Guard has also provided training to Ukrainian soldiers in Ukraine, prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Service is voluntary and unpaid, though members&#x27; loss of income from time taken off work, transport expenses and other basic expenses are compensated. However, workshop and depot staff plus clerks and senior officers are all paid. The unarmed Women&#x27;s Army Corps (&quot;Lottekorpset&quot;) was merged in 1989 with the then all-male Home Guard to form the present, armed unisex Home Guard.

Its top authority is the General Command (HJK) which is managed directly by the Danish Ministry of Defence (FMN). Only in times of tension and war will the Danish Defence Command (VFK) assume command over the Home Guard.

The Danish Home Guard is jointly headed by Major General Gunner Arpe Nielsen and a political leader (The Commissioner) who is usually a member of the Danish Parliament. As of February 1, 2024, MP Hans Andersen was named as the new political leader.

==History==
Created after World War II, the Danish Home Guard was inspired by the Danish Resistance Movement during the war. It was always implied (though never explicitly stated) that the primary objective was defence and guerrilla activity against a potential Soviet invasion.

When founded on 11 June 1945 in the city of Odense, the 250 representatives of resistance movements and those of the government, both had demands to the new Home Guard. The resistance movements were not interested in a people&#x27;s army run by the government and the government was not interested in a people&#x27;s army being independent and run solely by a military figure without parliament representation. Because of these bi-lateral demands, a simple solution to the problem was made. The Home Guard would have two chief executives: a Major General and a representative chosen by parliament.

Naturally, the organization would be funded by parliament, but organized directly under the Ministry of Defence, so that both sides had control.

With the creation of the Home Guard, the founding members swore to protect the Danish people against all enemies, both foreign and domestic, this referring to the Danish government during the occupation that supported Nazi Germany by handing over Danish citizens to the Gestapo. Despite this, members who had a seat in the government during the occupation claim in their defense that such actions were performed to protect the rest of the people from further war crimes. The Home Guard would be a military wing aiding the defense of Denmark from foreign aggressors and also a constant reminder for politicians who would be tempted by their political powers and influence that they cannot do whatever they please.

With the fall end of the cold war, the Home Guard, with its costly training and equipment, was by many Danes perceived as a useless expense, and an obsolete organization, referring to people&#x27;s attention that for the past four decades had been drawn outside of Denmark to an enemy that constantly swayed at the back of everyone&#x27;s mind.

In response to the people&#x27;s view of the Home Guard, the Danish government entrusted the organization with additional responsibilities in 2004. It should be trained for defense of Danish territory in wartimes but also be able to take on tasks to help civilians during disasters of most kinds, thereby rebalancing the expenses many had thought of as unnecessary.

The Danish government changed the Home Guard organisational structure and is now mainly an organisation to reinforce and to support the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force in fulfilling their missions. It became the fourth branch of the Danish Forces. The Home Guard was being included in the government&#x27;s Defense Act. In Denmark a public debate raise whether or not this organization now voluntarily owes its loyalty to the government rather than the Danish people.

Also the separation into two basic parts, the active force and the reserve get more obverse. To be eligible for active status, one must serve at least 24 documented hours in a calendar year.

Additionally, a force element called &quot;Centre for Stabilization Engagement&quot; (CSI) (Danish Home Guard&#x27;s international) has been created. Centre for Stabilization Engagement is responsible for the Danish Home Guard&#x27;s international tasks and contributions to Denmark&#x27;s international stabilization engagement. The Danish Home Guard&#x27;s contribution includes military capacity building, military support to civilian reconstruction, support to humanitarian efforts, and other international tasks, including security force protection. With a small mission in Iraq, the Home Guard started a number of missions abroad mostly with the Danish forces or allies of Denmark. In 2019 the Home Guard contributed volunteer instructors and one permanent officer to the British-led mission in Ukraine OP ORBITAL. Denmark supported the mission with mobile training teams (MTT) through the peace and stabilization program for Ukraine. The instructors were responsible for teaching approx. 800 Ukrainian soldiers in basic military skills.

An increasing number of qualified Home Guard personnel are being sent abroad on an equal basis with the Army, Navy and Air Force, most notably as Protection Teams under the auspices of Jægerkorpset, and also as guard platoons in Kosovo and Afghanistan.

== Structure ==
=== Structure in the late 1980s ===
In the late 1980s, the Home Guard Command was headquartered in Copenhagen and administered the home guard during peacetime. In case of war, the home guard units would have reinforced the other three armed services.

The Army Home Guard was commanded by a Major General. Home guard units were tasked to secure and guard key infrastructure, and report and delay enemy infiltrations by air or sea in their area of operation. The Army Home Guard divided Denmark into seven territorial regions, which were each commanded by a Colonel.

* Army Home Guard
*** 4x Homeguard Districts (Northern Zealand)
**** 4x Homeguard Staff Companies
**** 29x Area Companies
**** 4x Homeguard Military Police Companies
*** ? x Homeguard Districts (Copenhagen)
**** ? x Homeguard Staff Company 
**** ? x Area Company
**** ? x Homeguard Military Police Company
** 7th Territorial Region (Bornholm), responsible for Bornholm
*** 1x Homeguard District
**** Homeguard Staff Company
**** 5x Homeguard Area Companies
**** Homeguard Military Police Company

The Air Force Home Guard would have provided additional ground and air defense personnel to the Air Force, and would have manned the co-located operating base at which U.S. Air Force reinforcement would have been based.

The Naval Home Guard (&quot;Marinehjemmeværnet&quot; (MHV)) had a small number of ships for coastal surveillance. These included the MH-90-class cutters: MHV 90 Bopa, MHV 91 Brigaden, MHV 92 Holger Danske, MHV 93 Hvidsten, MHV 94 Ringen, and MHV 95 Speditøren.

=== Structure in 2017 ===

As of 2024, the Danish Home Guard consists of approximately 42,800 members, of whom approximately 12,800 are active. It is divided into three branches:

===Army Home Guard===
The Army Home Guard (&quot;Hærhjemmeværnet&quot;) is numerically the largest part of the Home Guard, and works closely with the regular army, police and the civil disaster management authorities.

Denmark is divided into two Regional commands, east and west, commanded by full-service colonels, and subdivided into 12 Army Home Guard Districts commanded by full-service officers.

Every municipality has at least one &quot;army home guard company&quot; commanded by a volunteer captain.

====Structure====
* Regional District West
** Army Home Guard District North Jutland (Aalborg)
** Army Home Guard District Middle and West Jutland (Skive)
** Army Home Guard District East Jutland (Aarhus)
** Army Home Guard District Southeast Jutland (Vejle)
** Army Home Guard District South Jutland and Schleswig ()
** Army Home Guard District Funen (Odense)
* Regional District East
** Army Home Guard District Copenhagen 
** Army Home Guard District South Zeeland and Lolland-Falster
** Army Home Guard District Middle and West Zeeland
** Army Home Guard District North Zeeland
** Army Home Guard District Copenhagen&#x27;s Western Area
** Bornholm&#x27;s Home Guard 
** Special Support and Reconnaissance Company

====Police Home Guard====

The Police Home Guard (&quot;Politihjemmeværnet&quot;) is a branch within the Army Home Guard and consists of 47 Police Home Guard companies, commanded by volunteer captains, often with a professional police career. The volunteers are, during operational service, given the authority to act on behalf of the police with a limited legal authority. Their tasks are, among others, traffic control at festivals, searching for victims, and guarding community installations. In peacetime they are never used where there are risks of direct confrontation with civilians (riot control or planned arrests).

====Infrastructure Home Guard====
The Infrastructure Home Guard (&quot;Virksomhedshjemmeværnet&quot;) is a branch within the Army Home Guard and ensures that civilian companies and authorities continue operating during times of crisis or catastrophe.
The Infrastructure Home Guard is divided into five branches:

* Transportation
* Communications
* Power Supply
* Water
* Health

All but mainly employees within the five branches can participate in the nine Infrastructure Home Guard Companies situated all over Denmark.

The members of the companies assist in keeping their places of work intact and prevent sabotage with use of lethal force. In peacetime the companies typically assist in guarding important railway lines or power plants.

Within the Regional Commands are a number of Liaison Officers who are experts in matters concerning the five branches. Manpower from the regular Army Home Guard can then be used with the right guidance in various situations.

===Naval Home Guard===

The Naval Home Guard (&quot;Marinehjemmeværnet&quot;) deals with securing naval installations, patrolling of the Danish territorial waters, and carries out Search and Rescue missions. It supports scientific research for Danish universities, provides vessels for police and customs operations ashore, and supports exercises and training of other military units (navy, special operations forces, etc.).

The Danish Naval Home Guard is commanded by a full service naval captain (&quot;kommandør&quot;) and a staff of professional full-service personnel. The organisation was totally revised by 1 January 2017. The professional staff is supported by voluntary service staff personnel of experts, planning personnel, advisors, specialists and instructors.

The Navy Home Guard comprises 35 flotillas (company sized units), with 30 &quot;general-purpose&quot; flotillas equipped with 900 klassen and 800 klassen ships, along with one flotilla equipped with 2 trailer-based speedboats and command vehicles. Their primary missions include surveillance, picture building, and security in territorial waters, as well as search and rescue operations.

Additionally, the Navy Home Guard maintains four highly specialized Maritime Force Protection (MFP) flotillas, utilizing speedboats and drones for harbor protection and escorts. These 35 units are always on a 1-hour call for search and rescue, military, and police deployments.

Alongside its operational prowess, the Navy Home Guard has two music corps and a staff unit.

The flotillas are all commanded by volunteer naval lieutenants (&quot;kaptajnløjtnanter&quot;).

===Air Force Home Guard===
The Air Force Home Guard (&quot;Flyverhjemmeværnet&quot;), supports the Danish air force, the police and other national authorities in their emergency management by securing airports, performing aerial environmental patrols of national waters.

* The Air Force Home Guard is commanded by a full-service air force colonel. The commander is supported by a small staff of full-service personnel.
* Municipalities with airfields or in the vicinity of airports have &quot;air force home guard squadrons&quot; – (100–150 riflemen), commanded by volunteer captains.
* The Air Force Home Guard operate two DHC-6 Twin Otter.

===Ranks===
==The Home Guard in civil society==
The Home Guard often gives so-called ordinary help to other authorities, especially the police. It&#x27;s especially Police Home Guard companies that aid in directing traffic, but also help for searching for missing persons and objects, and guarding crime scenes and such.

During COP15 in 2009, 1200 soldiers from the Home Guard aided the police in Copenhagen. Most of them were guarding and patrolling, but some of them were VIP drivers.

Members of a police company are also trained to give so-called &quot;special help&quot; to the police, which means tasks that are likely to involve the use of force against civilians (all kinds of police work). This help is to be negotiated between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Justice.

==Equipment==
The basic infantry weapon of the Home Guard is the 5.56mm GV M/95, while motorized units are equipped with the Kb M/96.

Suppressive fire is provided by the M/60 and M/62 machine guns and LSV M/04 light support weapon. Squad level anti-tank capabilities are provided with the M72 LAW.

The Home Guard utilizes a variety of different civilian transport vehicles and a small number of Mercedes GD light utility vehicle.

<doc id="1176621" wikidata="Q1379562" url="?curid=1176621" title="Thurman Thomas">
<text>Thurman Lee Thomas (born May 16, 1966) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He played college football for the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Thomas was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 1988 NFL draft, where he spent all but one season of his professional career. He spent his final NFL year as a member of the Miami Dolphins in 2000.

During his twelve seasons with the Bills, Thomas established himself as a central contributor of the Bills &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense that utilized no-huddle shotgun formations. He qualified for the Pro Bowl five times, twice received first-team All-Pro honors, and was NFL MVP in 1991. Thomas&#x27; efforts helped his team make a record four consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 1991 to 1994, although the Bills lost each game. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Houston, Texas. He grew up playing football on the Missouri City Junior High School (now Missouri City Middle School) and Willowridge High School teams. During the 1982–83 season, Thomas led the Willowridge football team to a Texas Class 4A State Title. He formerly resided in the Willow Park II subdivision, located southeast of the Fort Bend Tollway and Beltway 8.

==College career==
Thomas attended college at Oklahoma State University where he was an upperclassman teammate of running back Barry Sanders. At Oklahoma State, Thomas had 897 rushes for 4,595 yards, 43 touchdowns, 5,146 total yards, and 21 100-yard rushing games. He was also a Heisman Trophy candidate in his senior year, finishing seventh in voting. He was a first team selection on the College Football All-America Team in 1985 and 1987.

Thomas led the Big Eight in rushing and scoring in 1985 and 1987 and was voted the conference&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year both seasons. Thurman Thomas starred as a sophomore in 1985 when he posted 1,553 yards rushing, fourth best in the country. Between his sophomore and junior seasons he suffered a tear to his ACL in his left knee, missing some games during the 1986 season. He bounced back his senior season, rushing for 1,613 yards and finishing third nationally in rushing. From 1984 to 1987, Thomas carried the ball a remarkable 897 times for the Cowboys, the most rushing attempts in a career in Oklahoma State history.

In the 1987 Sun Bowl, Thomas ran for 157 yards and four touchdowns in the 35–33 comeback victory over West Virginia, keeping sophomore Barry Sanders on the sidelines for the majority of the game. Thomas left OSU as the school&#x27;s all-time leading rusher and his number 34 (chosen in honor of Earl Campbell and Walter Payton) is one of only three jerseys retired at Oklahoma State.

In 2008, Thomas was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Buffalo Bills===
A knee injury damaged Thomas&#x27;s certain first round pick status and caused him to slip into second round (40th overall) of the 1988 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills, their first choice in the draft. Seven other running backs were drafted ahead of him. Thomas is well known as part of the offense that included Jim Kelly and Andre Reed, which led the Bills to four straight Super Bowl appearances.

Thomas was the AFC rushing leader in three seasons (1990, 1991, and 1993). In the first three seasons of his career, Thomas had a total of twelve games with at least 100 yards rushing. The Bills won every one of those games. In 1989 and 1990, his combined total yards from scrimmage was 3,742. This was more than 200 yards better than any other player in the NFL. He was voted to the All-Pro team in 1990 and 1991, was selected to five straight Pro Bowls from 1989 to 1993, and was named NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1991, after becoming the eleventh player in NFL history to finish a season with over 2,000 all-purpose yards. Currently, he is fifteenth on the NFL all-time list for most rushing yards in a career.

Thomas currently holds the all-time Buffalo Bills rushing record with 11,938 yards and the team record for yards from scrimmage with 16,279 over twelve seasons. He is also fourth overall in team scoring. Overall, Thomas finished his thirteen seasons (the last one was spent in Miami) with 12,074 rushing yards, 472 receptions for 4,458 yards, and 88 touchdowns (65 rushing and 23 receiving) with 16,532 total yards from scrimmage.

Thomas is the only player in NFL history to lead the league in total yards from scrimmage for four consecutive seasons. He is one of only eight running backs to have over 400 receptions and 10,000 yards rushing. Walter Payton, Marshall Faulk, Marcus Allen, Ricky Watters, Tiki Barber, Warrick Dunn and LaDainian Tomlinson are the other six. Thomas is also one of five running backs to have rushed for over 1,000 yards in eight consecutive seasons along with Curtis Martin, Barry Sanders, Emmitt Smith and Tomlinson.

Thomas also set NFL playoff records with the most career points (126), touchdowns (21), and consecutive playoff games with a touchdown (nine). Overall, he rushed for 1,442 yards and caught 76 passes for 672 yards in his 21 postseason games. In a 1989 playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns, Thomas recorded thirteen receptions for 150 yards and two touchdowns, which was a postseason record for receptions by a running back and tied tight end Kellen Winslow&#x27;s record for most receptions in a playoff game. At the time of his retirement, his 76 postseason receptions ranked him fourth all time, and to this day he remains the only running back among the NFL&#x27;s top ten leaders in that category.

====Super Bowl XXV====
Thomas had an outstanding performance in Super Bowl XXV, rushing for 135 yards and a touchdown, while also catching five passes for 55 yards. He would have likely won the Super Bowl MVP award, but the Bills lost the game 20-19 when kicker Scott Norwood missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining.

Some fans and sports writers, such as Sports Illustrated writer Paul Zimmerman, have argued that Thomas had the best performance of the game, so therefore he should have won the MVP award even though his team lost. He had far more yards and catches than New York Giants running back Ottis Anderson, who won the MVP.

His performances in the Bills other postseason games that year were also superb. He rushed for a total of 255 yards, caught eight passes for 99 yards, and scored three touchdowns in their two playoff games prior to the Super Bowl.

====Super Bowl XXVI====
Thomas is noted for a mishap in Super Bowl XXVI. Thomas had a pre-game ritual where he placed his helmet at the 34-yard line. His helmet was moved in order for the stage to be set up for Harry Connick, Jr. to perform the national anthem. A trainer eventually found the helmet, but by then Thomas had missed Buffalo&#x27;s first two offensive plays. He went on to gain just thirteen rushing yards and a touchdown on ten carries. He also caught four passes for 27 yards. On August 8, 2009, during teammate Bruce Smith&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction speech, while he was acknowledging his relationship with Thomas, Bruce proclaimed &quot;I hid your helmet!&quot; Following the ceremony on NFL Total Access, Bruce indicated this was merely a joke.

====Super Bowl XXVII====
Thomas scored the first points of the game for his team on a two-yard touchdown run, but was limited to just nineteen rushing yards on eleven carries and four receptions for ten yards in Buffalo&#x27;s 52–17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Thomas was still recovering from a hip injury he suffered in the first game of the postseason. As a result, running back Kenneth Davis got the majority of carries in the game. Thomas also committed a costly fumble that was converted into a Dallas touchdown.

====Super Bowl XXVIII====
Thomas had another disappointing Super Bowl performance in this game, which the Bills lost to the Cowboys 30–13. He scored the only touchdown of the game for his team, but was limited to just 37 rushing yards on sixteen carries. He was a reliable target as a receiver out of the backfield, catching seven passes for 52 yards but he lost two fumbles that led to ten Dallas points.

===Miami Dolphins===
Thomas signed with the Miami Dolphins during the 2000 off-season, after the Bills had released him to clear space under the salary cap. He suffered a knee injury on November 12, 2000, against the San Diego Chargers which ended his NFL career. In his only season with the Dolphins, Thomas ran for 136 yards on 28 carries and no rushing touchdowns while having sixteen receptions for 117 yards and one receiving touchdown in nine games.

===Retirement, Pro Football Hall of Fame===
After deciding to retire, Thomas signed a ceremonial one-day contract on February 27, 2001, with the Bills.

Thurman Thomas was first eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. In that year, he made it to the list of ten finalists, but was not one of the six players elected to the Hall that year. He was selected on February 3, 2007, to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Thomas joined his former quarterback Jim Kelly and wide receiver James Lofton in the Hall of Fame.

Thomas, Steve Tasker, Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, Don Beebe, and Jim Kelly were the subject of the &quot;30 for 30&quot; film, &quot;Four Falls of Buffalo&quot;.

His jersey number, 34, was retired by the Bills on national TV on Monday October 29, 2018 in honor of his achievements.

==Personal life==
Thomas is married to Patti Mariacher, who is from Buffalo and was on the Oklahoma State University golf team. They have four children, Olivia, Angel, Annika, and Thurman III.

He is involved with several business enterprises including sports, energy, telecommunications and construction. He was appointed as vice chair of the New York State Tourism Advisory Council in 2014.

Thomas has been involved in community issues since early in his career, establishing the Thurman Thomas Foundation in 1992. He has talked about mental health and the effects of concussions suffered during his football career.

<doc id="1176627" wikidata="Q2175923" url="?curid=1176627" title="Shit happens">
<text>Shit happens is a slang sentence that is used as a simple existential observation that life is full of unfortunate unpredictable events, similar to &quot;&quot;c&#x27;est la vie&quot;&quot;. The sentence is an acknowledgment that bad things happen to people seemingly for no particular reason. 

It can also be said less vulgarly, including phrases such as &quot;it happens&quot; or &quot;stuff happens&quot;.

==History==
The fact that people have been remarking that shit happens has been attested from 1964, when Carl Werthman quoted an example in his UC Berkeley masters thesis; the relevant excerpt was published in &quot;The American City&quot; (edited by Anselm L. Strauss) in 1968.

==Examples of usage==

The term is used on the back of a car sticker in the episode Speed 3 of Father Ted

In 2011, Australian politician Tony Abbott, who was at the time Opposition Leader and leader of the Liberal Party (later becoming Prime Minister), used the sentence in an interview.

Australian toilet paper and essential goods retailer Shhit Happens uses a modification of the phrase as their trade name. Stylised as either &#x27;Shhit Happens&#x27; or &#x27;Shh!t Happens&#x27;.

<text>Julie on Sesame Street is a variety special that was broadcast in the United States on ABC on November 23, 1973 at 9 PM ET / PT. Sponsored on ABC by technology/telecommunications conglomerate GTE, the special starred Julie Andrews and Perry Como, and they were joined by several of Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets from the PBS children&#x27;s series, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. No human members of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; cast appeared in this special. Andrews and &quot;special guest star&quot; Como interacted with the Muppet characters (including Kermit the Frog, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, and Bert and Ernie), sharing comedic banter and singing songs such as &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy Being Green&quot; and &quot;Picture a World&quot; on the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; &quot;neighborhood&quot; set.

The special was produced by ATV and ITC at ATV Elstree in the United Kingdom (and not at &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s then-usual New York City studios), It was televised in that country on ITV on July 10, 1974 at 8pm in most regions. The special was the first Muppets-related program to be produced with ATV and ITC, who would both co-produce the highly successful &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; three years later.

The construction of the Alford Valley Railway started in 1856 and the line opened in 1859 as a Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) branch line from Kintore railway station, northwest of Aberdeen, with stations at Kemnay, Monymusk, Tillyfourie, Whitehouse and Alford. The line also served Kemnay Quarry and three other granite quarries in the area. The summit of the line is just west of Tillyfourie at where a mile-long cutting deep required cutting through particularly hard granite. The train took just over an hour for the journey. Until 1883, by law the third class fare on one train a day could not be more than a penny per mile.

In 1923 GNSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway and, in 1948, became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways. The line closed to passengers on 31 December 1949, when driver Mr James Tocher drove the last passenger train into Alford Station. The goods service closed exactly sixteen years later on 31 December 1965, when the last train was driven by Mr Robert Asher, and attended by Mr James Elder, guard, both Aberdeen, and Mr Walter Mearns, fireman, Inverurie.

==Narrow gauge railway==
The narrow gauge railway, built from salvaged equipment from the New Pitsligo peat moss railway, was proposed in 1979 and opened in 1980. Originally it ran for from Haughton Park station through Murray Park Woods. Then in 1984 another line was run from station, alongside Alford Golf Course, to Haughton Park about away where there is a platform. However, the original Murray Woods line was then closed.

The current station building is on the site of the original granite structure which was demolished after British Rail closed the line. The passenger platform is the original. A small railway museum is housed in the railway station building. The original locomotive shed was situated to the east of the station but this has also now been demolished. To the west of the station the granite carriage shed of the previous railway is now used by the Alford Valley Railway. The Grampian Transport Museum and Alford Heritage Museum are nearby.

The railway closed in 2017. A new group, the Alford Valley Community Railway, was subsequently formed with the intention of reopening the line. After six years of closure, the Alford Valley Community Railway was re-opened in August 2023 to passengers.

<text>Expo.02 was the 6th Swiss national exposition, which was held from 15 May to 20 October 2002. The exposition took place around the lakes of Neuchâtel, Bienne/Biel and Morat/Murten. It was divided into five sites, which were called &quot;Arteplages&quot;, due to the proximity of the water (some sites were actually partially or totally built on the water). The five &quot;arteplages&quot; were located in Neuchâtel, Yverdon-les-Bains, Morat/Murten, Biel/Bienne and on a mobile barge traveling from one site to another. The barge represented the canton of Jura, which does not have access to any one of the three lakes.

Expo.02 was the subject of controversy in Switzerland due to the many financial problems it encountered. It was first scheduled to take place in 2001 (under the name of &quot;Expo.01&quot;), but the catastrophic organization and lack of funding threatened to put an end to the project, which was saved at the last minute by the Swiss Federal Government, which put in a large amount of public money to save the exhibition. Expo.02 cost 1.6 billion Swiss francs. Most of it came from major Swiss companies which sponsored the different exhibitions on the &quot;Arteplages&quot;.

According to the organisers, more than 10 million admissions were counted, and the exhibition succeeded in achieving its sole and only goal: the public&#x27;s pleasure.

Each &quot;arteplage&quot; was dedicated to a different theme. There was &quot;Nature and Artifice&quot; in Neuchâtel, &quot;I and the Universe&quot; in Yverdon-les-Bains, &quot;Instants and Eternity&quot; in Murten/Morat, &quot;Power and Freedom&quot; in Biel/Bienne and &quot;Sense and Movement&quot; on the mobile platform.

<doc id="1176676" wikidata="Q1797527" url="?curid=1176676" title="Coffin Joe">
<text>Zé do Caixão , known in English-speaking countries as [[:en:Coffin Joe|Coffin Joe]], is a character created and nominally played by Brazilian writer, director, and actor José Mojica Marins. An amoral undertaker with Nietzschian beliefs, he is driven by his desire to have a son by &quot;the perfect woman&quot;, believing that immortality is achieved through procreation, a concept he refers to as &quot;the continuation of blood&quot;. He often resorts to murder, kidnapping, and rape to achieve his means, with his violent nature, atheism, and antagonism towards Christianity placing him into conflict with his largely Catholic neighbors. Despite his own disbelief in the supernatural, he often finds himself experiencing paranormal phenomena, including encounters with ghosts, Death, and visions of Hell.

Initially conceived of by Marins to serve as the antagonist in &quot;At Midnight I&#x27;ll Take Your Soul&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s first horror film, Coffin Joe has gone on to appear in nine more films, three television series, songs, music videos, and comic books. The character has been called &quot;Brazil&#x27;s National Boogeyman&quot;, and is considered a horror icon and a cultural icon of Brazil, with his popularity resulting in descriptions of him as being the Brazilian equivalent of the United States&#x27; Freddy Krueger.

==Description==
Coffin Joe is an undertaker by trade and runs his own funeral home, from which he also sells caskets, flowers, and wreaths. Unlike his neighbors, who dress largely in peasant or farming clothes, he wears a black top hat, black suit, and black cape; his most distinctive features are his thick beard and grotesquely long, curled fingernails. He is an amoral character who considers himself superior to others and exploits them to suit his purposes. He believes in reason and materialism, eschewing all religion and superstition, believing them to be impediments to human evolution; he looks down on anyone who does not hold his beliefs as inferior and exploitable, especially his Catholic neighbors. Conversely, he accepts others who share his beliefs as &quot;superior&quot;, particularly women. The only individuals Joe considers to be pure are children, whom he believes have yet to be corrupted by the false moral codes of the adult world and towards whom he shows uncharacteristic displays of kindness.

While Joe himself disbelieves in the paranormal, he oftentimes finds himself experiencing supernatural phenomena, including encounters with ghosts (&quot;At Midnight I&#x27;ll Take Your Soul&quot;), visions of Hell (&quot;This Night I&#x27;ll Possess Your Corpse&quot;), and meeting otherworldly beings, including Death itself (&quot;Embodiment of Evil&quot;). The character rarely comments on these experiences, and they appear to have no lasting effect on his cosmology or personal beliefs.

Although none of the films in which he appears explore the character&#x27;s backstory, Marins has outlined in interviews that Joe became jaded when he fought with the Brazilian Expeditionary Force in World War II, and developed his attitudes towards women when he returned home to learn that his beloved had begun an affair in his absence. The dual experiences both forged Joe&#x27;s beliefs about mankind, as well as his desire to find the &quot;perfect&quot; woman.

==Background and conception== 
At the time of the first film&#x27;s production, Brazil had produced no horror films of its own. Marins was a lifelong fan of horror films, having grown up watching them in the theater that his family owned, operated and lived above in an apartment.

Marins states that the idea for the character came in a dream:
Although rarely mentioned in the films, Coffin Joe&#x27;s true name is Josefel Zanatas. Marins gives an explanation for the name in an interview for Portal Brasileiro de Cinema:

==Appearances==
===The Coffin Joe Trilogy===
Coffin Joe first appears in &quot;At Midnight I&#x27;ll Take Your Soul&quot; as the sole undertaker of a small, rural town somewhere in the vicinity of São Paulo. Although the rest of the townspeople hold him in contempt for his anti-Catholic sentiments and violent nature, they live in fear of him for his physical prowess and ability to best any man in a fight. The only people with whom Joe shares even a cordial relationship are his wife, Lenita, best friend Anthony, and Anthony&#x27;s fiancée, Terezinha, whom Joe lusts for. Believing himself to be of intellectual superiority to those around him, Joe&#x27;s primary drive is &quot;the continuity of blood&quot; in the form of a son born from &quot;the perfect woman&quot;. After learning that Lenita cannot conceive, Joe kills her with a venomous tarantula, then murders Anthony by drowning him in a bathtub. Both deaths are ruled accidental and Joe makes advances on Terezinha, who turns him down. An enraged Joe rapes her, but Terezinha commits suicide rather than report him, though she promises vengeance from beyond the grave. On Dia de Finados, Joe witnesses a procession of ghosts who chase him to Anthony and Terezinha&#x27;s tomb, where he witnesses their bodies coming to life. Later, the townspeople find Joe on the tomb steps, apparently dead, with his eyes bulging from their sockets.

Joe returns in &quot;This Night I&#x27;ll Possess Your Corpse&quot;, in which it is revealed that he survived his encounter with Terezinha and Anthony&#x27;s ghosts, though he was temporarily blinded. After recovering and going to trial, he is found not guilty for his crimes and returns to his mortuary business. Still desiring a son, he orders his henchman, Bruno, to begin kidnapping women from the town that he has dubbed superior, subjecting them to a series of tortures to see who endures. A woman named Marcia seems impervious to fear or pain, prompting Joe to declare her his &quot;perfect woman&quot;, though she rebuffs him when he tries to make love to her while listening to the rest of the women being fatally bitten by venomous snakes. Joe permits her to leave alive, then sets his sights on Laura, the atheist daughter of a prominent colonel. Sharing Coffin Joe&#x27;s beliefs, the pair become lovers, and Joe conspires to blame his crimes on the Colonel&#x27;s protege. Although Laura becomes pregnant, both she and their son die in childbirth. Meanwhile, Marcia, wracked with guilt, confesses her experiences, and a lynch mob forms to pursue Joe. They chase him to a swamp, where he is shot. As Joe sinks into the water, a priest offers him salvation, and Joe agrees to die as a Christian before apparently drowning.

Joe returns again in &quot;Embodiment of Evil&quot;, with a flashback revealing that Joe only momentarily faked his death, surfacing seconds later to deny God and mock the priest before blinding him with his fingernails. Captured and tried for murder, Joe is sentenced to 40 years in prison before being released onto the streets of 2008 São Paulo. Reuniting with Bruno, Joe discovers that a cult has formed around his teachings and beliefs. Joe begins dispatching his followers to bring him women, whom he subjects to mental and physical torture; several women voluntarily fall under his sway, including a eugenicist. Throughout the ordeal, Joe is haunted by visions of his past victims, as well as disturbing hallucinations foretelling his own death. Meanwhile, Joe is pursued by a fervently Catholic police captain and a mentally unhinged priest named Father Eugenio, the son of one of his victims. The pair ultimately pursue Joe to an abandoned amusement park, where he succeeds in killing the captain before himself being stabbed to death with a crucifix by Father Eugenio. In an epilogue, Joe&#x27;s followers congregate at his graveside, where it is revealed that several of the women are pregnant.

===Appearance in other films===
Joe appears as the host of the 1968 anthology film &quot;The Strange World of Coffin Joe&quot;, introducing the film&#x27;s segments.

Joe appears as a fictional character in the 1970 film &quot;Awakening of the Beast&quot;, in which test subjects dosed with LSD have hallucinations of him after viewing a movie poster for &quot;The Strange World of Coffin Joe&quot;.

&quot;The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe&quot; is a metafilm about José Mojica Marins being haunted by the character, who has come to life as an avatar of Satan.

&quot;The Strange Hostel of Naked Pleasures&quot; features a character strongly implied to be Coffin Joe, here operating as the proprietor of an ambiguously haunted hostel.

He again returns as a fictional character in &quot;Hallucinations of a Deranged Mind&quot;, in which a scientist seeks out the help of Marins after being haunted by dreams in which Coffin Joe abducts his wife. The film is partially composed of deleted scenes from previous Coffin Joe movies.

===As a horror host===
Marins has often appeared in character as Coffin Joe in the role of a horror host.

From 1967 to 1988, Marins hosted the program &quot;Além, Muito Além do Além&quot; (&quot;Beyond, Much Beyond the Beyond&quot;) Fridays on TV Bandeirantes, in character as Coffin Joe, presenting short horror tales written by author and screenwriter Rubens Luchetti. Some scripts were later adapted as Coffin Joe comic books. The show&#x27;s tapes were reused and currently there are no known intact recordings of this program.

Marins directed and hosted &quot;The Show from the Other World&quot; (&quot;Um Show do Outro Mundo&quot;) on &quot;Rede Record de Televisão&quot;, again appearing as Coffin Joe. The half-hour program featured short horror films, with many of the stories sent in by the viewers themselves and adapted by members of Marins&#x27; production team. As with his earlier show, the original tapes were reused and there is no known record of this material.

In 1996 Marins hosted the daily television program &quot;Cine Trash&quot; on TV Bandeirantes, which featured full-length horror films.

===Portrayals by other actors===

Across all his appearances, Coffin Joe has been portrayed by Marins with the exception of the flashback sequences in &quot;Embodiment of Evil&quot;, in which he was played by actor, writer, and director Raymond Castille. Castille came to Marins&#x27; attention for his comedic short film &quot;The Blind Date of Coffin Joe&quot;, a parody of the first two films in the trilogy in which Joe—played by Castille and living in modern-day America—attempts to find the perfect woman through internet dating.

<doc id="1176678" wikidata="Q2709081" url="?curid=1176678" title="Original Pirate Material">
<text>Original Pirate Material is the debut studio album by English hip hop project the Streets, released on 25 March 2002. Recorded mostly in a room in a south London house rented at the time by principal member Mike Skinner, the album is musically influenced by UK garage and American hip hop, while its lyrics tell stories of British working-class life. It was supported by four singles: &quot;Has It Come to This?&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Push Things Forward&quot;, &quot;Weak Become Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Mug Yourself&quot;.

The album originally rose to number 12 on the UK Albums Chart in 2002, and then peaked at number 10 in 2004 following the release of the chart-topping second Streets album &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot;. It re-entered several charts in April 2022, following its reissue on orange vinyl for 2022&#x27;s Record Store Day. &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the originality and humour of Skinner&#x27;s lyrics, and subsequent critics&#x27; polls have placed it among the best albums of the 2000s.

==Background==
Skinner has stated that his main early influences were from the United States, in particular Wu-Tang Clan rappers such as Raekwon and RZA, as well as East Coast rapper Nas&#x27;s album &quot;Illmatic&quot;. However, Skinner attributes the album as emerging from the UK garage scene of the late 1990s. His stance when making the album was to combine the UK garage sound with a lyrical content about &quot;all the little adventures you go on&quot; rather than the style of UK hip hop, which he accused of being &quot;someone from Reading pretending to be Biggie or Q-Tip&quot;.

Journalist Simon Reynolds identified the album&#x27;s lyrical content as capturing UK garage&#x27;s &quot;submerged reality&quot; as a genre not based in nightclubs. Outside London in the late 1990s, UK garage was rarely played in clubs but was instead found on pirate radio stations, reflected by the album&#x27;s title.

==Recording==
Recording for &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; lasted over a year, with Skinner recording the bulk of the album in the room he was renting in a house in Brixton in south London. The instrumental tracks were created on an IBM ThinkPad, while Skinner used an emptied out wardrobe as a vocal booth using duvets and mattresses to reduce echo. Direct influences on the album included the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;, which inspired the lyrics of &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, the opening track of the album. He eschewed analogue recording equipment and recorded and mixed the album entirely on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation.

==Artwork==
The cover artwork depicts the south face of the Kestrel House tower block on City Road, London at night. The photo was taken in 1995 by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg using an eight-minute exposure.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; was hailed by the British music press upon its release. &quot;NME&quot; said that the album &quot;represents a brilliant break with cliché ... [Skinner is] one of the most original pop voices for years... By turns dark, funny and heartbreaking, the songs on &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; are snapshots of ordinary life as a young Midlands resident, set to innovative two-step production: tales of love, going out, being skint, getting drunk, and eating chips. It&#x27;s Streets by name, and streets by nature, and it&#x27;s great.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; called Skinner a &quot;vital new voice&quot; and described &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; as &quot;starkly observed vignettes ... this debut wittily and wisely documents young lives spent in piss-poor pubs, estate bedrooms and kebab shops... It could easily, but somehow never does, degenerate into the kind of &#x27;street poet&#x27; blather TV news editors think spices up election coverage.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; said that Skinner &quot;favours a winningly downbeat brand of urban realism, set to minimal, pounding drums ... A lot of his urban vignettes fall somewhere between &quot;The Message&quot; and the Specials&#x27; &quot;Ghost Town&quot;. But their very ordinariness and the brutish, unadorned simplicity of the music is part of their appeal, evoking the everyday tedium of &quot;real&quot; &#x27;youth culture&#x27; ... A uniquely British voice.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;Mike Skinner ... could be the most gifted rapper London has ever produced, except that he doesn&#x27;t really rap – he pontificates, spins spoken-word yarns, and kicks running commentary. Hip-hop – and Britain&#x27;s equally bling-fixated 2-step-garage scene – has shaped Skinner&#x27;s sound, but he&#x27;s too earnest to reproduce their bluster. He&#x27;s an observant, asphalt-level &#x27;geezer&#x27; – Brit slang for everyman – set apart by the sharpness of his lens, not the force of his flow. On &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot;, Skinner nails the quiet desperation of the white working class like a pub-hooligan Marshall Mathers, with all of Slim Shady&#x27;s good humor and none of his insanity.&quot;

Contemporary reviews for the album commented on its DIY aesthetic and lyricism. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said that the album &quot;combines the boy-next-door DIY of US garage rock with the sound of UK garage and displays an alchemic ability to turn the humdrum of everyday life into a record that is at times empowering, hilarious, melancholy, awkward, and charming.&quot;

===Accolades===
Since its release in 2002, &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; has received several accolades. In March 2003, &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; at number 46 on their list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot;. They subsequently placed the album at number nine in their list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Decade&quot;. &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot; ranked it as the best album of the 2000s. Journalist Simon Reynolds also placed the album at the top of his list of his favourite albums of the 2000s, with a &quot;special &#x27;in a class of its own&#x27; award&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number ten on their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004; they later placed it at number 36 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s. In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked the album 139th in their list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.&quot;

<doc id="1176679" wikidata="Q708676" url="?curid=1176679" title="Charitable organization">
<text>A charitable organization or charity is an organization whose primary objectives are philanthropy and social well-being (e.g. educational, religious or other activities serving the public interest or common good).

The legal definition of a charitable organization (and of charity) varies between countries and in some instances regions of the country. The regulation, the tax treatment, and the way in which charity law affects charitable organizations also vary. Charitable organizations may not use any of their funds to profit individual persons or entities. However, some charitable organizations have come under scrutiny for spending a disproportionate amount of their income to pay the salaries of their leadership.
Financial figures (e.g. tax refunds, revenue from fundraising, revenue from the sale of goods and services or revenue from investment, and funds held in reserve) are indicators to assess the financial sustainability of a charity, especially to charity evaluators. This information can impact on a charity&#x27;s reputation with donors and societies, and thus the charity&#x27;s financial gains.

Charitable organizations often depend partly on donations from businesses. Such donations to charitable organizations represent a major form of corporate philanthropy.

To meet the exempt organizational test requirements, a charity has to be exclusively organized and operated, and to receive and pass the exemption test, a charitable organization must follow the public interest and all exempt income should be for the public interest. For example, in many countries of the Commonwealth, charitable organizations must demonstrate that they provide a public benefit.

==History==
=== Early systems ===
Until the mid-18th century, charity was mainly distributed through religious structures (such as the English Poor Laws of 1601), almshouses, and bequests from the rich. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam incorporated significant charitable elements from their very beginnings, and &quot;dāna&quot; (alms-giving) has a long tradition in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. Charities provided education, health, housing, and even prisons. Almshouses were established throughout Europe in the Early Middle Ages to provide a place of residence for the poor, old, and distressed people; King Athelstan of England (reigned 924–939) founded the first recorded almshouse in York in the 10th century.

===Enlightenment charity===

During the Enlightenment era, charitable and philanthropic activity among voluntary associations and affluent benefactors became a widespread cultural practice. Societies, gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, and mutual associations began to flourish in England, with the upper classes increasingly adopting a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged. In England, this new social activism led to the establishment of charitable organizations, which proliferated from the middle of the 18th century.

This emerging upper-class trend for benevolence resulted in the incorporation of the first charitable organizations. Appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of London, Captain Thomas Coram set up the Foundling Hospital in 1741 to care for these unwanted orphans in Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Fields, Bloomsbury. This institution, the world&#x27;s first of its kind, served as the precedent for incorporated associational charities in general.

Another notable philanthropist of the Enlightenment era, Jonas Hanway, established The Marine Society in 1756 as the first seafarers&#x27; charity, aiming to aid the recruitment of men into the navy. By 1763, the Society had enlisted over 10,000 men, and an Act of Parliament incorporated it in 1772. Hanway also played a key role in founding the Magdalen Hospital to rehabilitate prostitutes. These organizations were funded by subscriptions and operated as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness about their activities through the emerging popular press and generally enjoyed high social regard. Some charities received state recognition in the form of a royal charter.

Charities also began to take on campaigning roles, championing causes and lobbying the government for legislative changes. This included organized campaigns against the mistreatment of animals and children, as well as the successful campaign in the early 19th century to end the slave trade throughout the British Empire and its extensive sphere of influence. (However, this process was quite lengthy, concluding when slavery in Saudi Arabia was abolished slavery in 1962.)

The Enlightenment era also witnessed a growing philosophical debate between those advocating for state intervention and those believing that private charities should provide welfare. The political economist, Reverend Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), criticized poor relief for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector. His views became highly influential and informed the Victorian &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude toward state intervention for the poor.

===Growth during the 19th century===
During the 19th century, a profusion of charitable organizations emerged to alleviate the awful conditions of the working class in the slums. The Labourer&#x27;s Friend Society, chaired by Lord Shaftesbury in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to laborers for &quot;cottage husbandry&quot;, which later became the allotment movement. In 1844, it became the first Model Dwellings Company – one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, all the while receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first housing associations, a philanthropic endeavor that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, brought about by the growth of the middle class. Later associations included the Peabody Trust (originating in 1862) and the Guinness Trust (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given the label &quot;five percent philanthropy&quot;.

There was strong growth in municipal charities. The Brougham Commission led to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from the local government.

Charities at the time, including the Charity Organization Society (established in 1869), tended to discriminate between the &quot;deserving poor&quot;, who would be provided with suitable relief, and the &quot;underserving&quot; or &quot;improvident poor&quot;, who was regarded as the cause of their woes due to their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived demoralizing effect. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the form of statutory regulation and even limited funding.

Philanthropy became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. Octavia Hill (1838–1912) and John Ruskin (1819–1900) were important forces behind the development of social housing, and Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America. In &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; (1889), Carnegie wrote about the responsibilities of great wealth and the importance of social justice. He established public libraries throughout English-speaking countries and contributed large sums to schools and universities. A little over ten years after his retirement, Carnegie had given away over 90% of his fortune.

Towards the end of the 19th century, with the advent of the New Liberalism and the innovative work of Charles Booth in documenting working-class life in London, attitudes towards poverty began to change. This led to the first social liberal welfare reforms, including the provision of old age pensions and free school-meals.

=== 20th century ===
During the 20th century, charitable organizations such as Oxfam (established in 1947), Care International, and Amnesty International expanded greatly, becoming large, multinational non-governmental organizations with very large budgets.

=== 21st century ===
With the advent of the Internet, charitable organizations established a presence on online social media platforms and began initiatives such as cyber-based humanitarian crowdfunding, exemplified by platforms like GoFundMe.

==By jurisdiction==

===Australia===
The definition of charity in Australia is derived from English common law, originally from the Charitable Uses Act 1601, and then through several centuries of case law based upon it. In 2002, the federal government initiated an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This led to the &quot;Charities Bill 2003&quot;, which included limitations on the involvement of charities in political campaigning, an unwelcome departure from the case law as perceived by many charities. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. However, due to widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.

Subsequently, the government introduced the &quot;Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004&quot;. This act did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose but rather aimed to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, resolving legal doubts surrounding their charitable status. Among these purposes were childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.

To publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds. For example, in Queensland, charities must register with the Queensland Office of Fair Trading. Additionally, any charity fundraising online must obtain approval from every Australian jurisdiction that mandates such approval. Currently, these jurisdictions include New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. Numerous Australian charities have appealed to federal, state, and territory governments to establish uniform legislation enabling charities registered in one state or territory to raise funds in all other Australian jurisdictions.

The Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC) commenced operations in December 2012. It regulates approximately 56,000 non-profit organizations with tax-exempt status, along with around 600,000 other NPOs in total, seeking to standardize state-based fund-raising laws.

A Public Benevolent Institution (PBI) is a specific type of charity with its primary purpose being to alleviate suffering in the community, whether due to poverty, sickness, or disability. Examples of institutions that might qualify include hospices, providers of subsidized housing, and certain not-for-profit aged care services.

===Canada===

Charities in Canada need to be registered with the Charities Directorate of the Canada Revenue Agency. According to the Canada Revenue Agency:

A registered charity is an organization established and operated for charitable purposes. It must devote its resources to charitable activities. The charity must be a resident in Canada and cannot use its income to benefit its members.
A charity also has to meet a public benefit test. To qualify under this test, an organization must show that:
* its activities and purposes provide a tangible benefit to the public.
* those eligible for benefits are either the public as a whole or a significant section of it. They should not be a restricted group or one where members share a private connection, such as social clubs or professional associations with specific memberships.
* the charity&#x27;s activities must be legal and must not be contrary to public policy.
To register as a charity, the organization has to be either incorporated or governed by a legal document called a trust or a constitution. This document has to explain the organization&#x27;s purposes and structure.

=== France ===
Most French charities are registered under the statute of &quot;loi d&#x27;association de 1901,&quot; a type of legal entity for non-profit NGOs. This statute is extremely common in France for any type of group that wants to be institutionalized (sports clubs, book clubs, support groups...), as it is very easy to set up and requires very little documentation. However, for an organization under the statute of &quot;loi 1901&quot; to be considered a charity, it has to file with the authorities to come under the label of &quot;&quot;association d&#x27;utilité publique&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;NGO acting for the public interest&quot;. This label gives the NGO some tax exemptions.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, charitable organizations are referred to as &quot;public-benefit organizations&quot; (). The term was introduced on 1 January 1997 through the Act on Public Benefit Organizations.

===India===
Under Indian law, legal entities such as charitable organizations, corporations, and managing bodies have been given the status of &quot;legal persons&quot; with legal rights, such as the right to sue and be sued, and the right to own and transfer property. Indian charitable organizations with this status include Sir Ratan Tata Trust.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Charities Act (2009) legislated the establishment of a &quot;Charities Regulatory Authority&quot;, and the Charities Regulator was subsequently created via a ministerial order in 2014. This was the first legal framework for charity registration in Ireland. The Charities Regulator maintains a database of organizations that have been granted charitable tax exemption—a list previously maintained by the Revenue Commissioners. Such organizations would have a CHY number from the Revenue Commissioners, a CRO number from the Companies Registration Office, and a charity number from the Charities Regulator.

The Irish Nonprofits Database was created by Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange (INKEx) to serve as a repository for regulatory and voluntarily disclosed information about Irish public benefit nonprofits.

===Nigeria===
Charitable organizations in Nigeria are registerable under &quot;Part C&quot; of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020. Under the law, the Corporate Affairs Commission, Nigeria, being the official Nigerian Corporate Registry, is empowered to maintain and regulate the formation, operation, and dissolution of charitable organizations in Nigeria. Charitable organizations in Nigeria are exempted under §25(c) of the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) Cap. C21 LFN 2004 (as amended), which exempts from income tax corporate organizations engaged wholly in ecclesiastical, charitable, or educational activities. Similarly, §3 of the Value Added Tax Act (VATA) Cap. V1 LFN 2004 (as amended), and the 1st Schedule to the VATA on exempted Goods and Services goods zero-rates goods and services purchased by any ecclesiastical, charitable, or educational institutions in furtherance of their charitable mandates.

=== Poland ===
A public benefit organization (, often abbreviated as OPP) is a term used in Polish law. It was introduced on 1 January 2004 by the statute on public good activity and volunteering. Charitable organizations of public good are allowed to receive 1.5% of income tax from individuals, making them &quot;tax-deductible organizations&quot;. To receive such status, an organization has to be a non-governmental organization, with political parties and trade unions not qualifying. The organization must also be involved in specific activities related to the public good as described by the law, and it should demonstrate sufficient transparency in its activities, governance, and finances. Moreover, data has shown that this evidence is pertinent and sensible.

Polish charitable organizations with this status include Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, KARTA Center, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Silesian Fantasy Club, the Polish Historical Society, and the Polish chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation.

===Singapore===
The legal framework in Singapore is regulated by the Singapore Charities Act (Chapter 37). Charities in Singapore must be registered with the Charities Directorate of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports. One can also find specific organizations that are members of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which is operated by the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

=== Ukraine ===
The legislation governing charitable activities and the process of obtaining charitable organization status is regulated by Ukraine&#x27;s Civil Code and the Law of Ukraine on Charitable Activities and Charitable Organizations.

According to Ukrainian law, there are three forms of charitable organizations:
* A &quot;charitable society&quot; is a charitable organization created by at least two founders and operates based on the charter or statute.
* A &quot;charitable institution&quot; is a type of charitable trust that acts based on the constituent or founding act. This charitable organization&#x27;s founding act defines the assets that one or several founders transfer to achieve the goals of charitable activity, along with any income from such assets. A constituent act of a charitable institution may be contained in a will or testament. The founder or founders of the charitable institution do not participate in the management of such a charitable organization.
* A &quot;charitable fund&quot; or &quot;charitable foundation&quot; is a charitable organization that operates based on the charter, has participants or members, and is managed by them. Participants or members are not obliged to transfer any assets to such an organization to achieve the goals of charitable activity. A charitable foundation can be created by one or several founders. The assets of a charitable fund can be formed by participants and/or other benefactors.

The Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is the main registration authority for charitable organization registration and constitution. Individuals and legal entities, except for public authorities and local governments, can be the founders of charitable organizations. Charitable societies and charitable foundations may have, in addition to founders, other participants who have joined them as prescribed by the charters of such charitable associations or charitable foundations. Aliens (non-Ukrainian citizens and legal entities, corporations, or non-governmental organizations) can be the founders and members of philanthropic organizations in Ukraine.

All funds received by a charitable organization and used for charitable purposes are exempt from taxation, but obtaining non-profit status from the tax authority is necessary.

Legalization is required for international charitable funds to operate in Ukraine.

===United Kingdom===
Charity law in the UK varies among (i) England and Wales, (ii) Scotland and (iii) Northern Ireland, but the fundamental principles are the same. Most organizations that are charities are required to be registered with the appropriate regulator for their jurisdiction, but significant exceptions apply so that many organizations are &quot;bona fide&quot; charities but do not appear on a public register. The registers are maintained by the Charity Commission for England and Wales and by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator for Scotland. The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland maintains a register of charities that have completed formal registration (see below). Organizations applying must meet the specific legal requirements summarized below, have filing requirements with their regulator, and are subject to inspection or other forms of review. The oldest charity in the UK is The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, established in 597 AD.

Charitable organizations, including charitable trusts, are eligible for a complex set of reliefs and exemptions from taxation in the UK. These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax, and value added tax. These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a tax avoidance technique rather than offering a genuine charitable good.

The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 subjects charities to regulation by the Electoral Commission in the run-up to a general election.

====England and Wales====

=====Definition=====
Section 1 of the Charities Act 2011 provides the definition in England and Wales:

:(1) For the purposes of the law of England and Wales, &quot;charity&quot; means an institution which—
:(a) is established for charitable purposes only, and
:(b) falls to be subject to the control of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction with respect to charities.

The Charities Act 2011 provides the following list of charitable purposes:

# the prevention or relief of poverty
# the advancement of education
# the advancement of religion
# the advancement of health or the saving of lives
# the advancement of citizenship or community development
# the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science
# the advancement of amateur sport
# the advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity
# the advancement of environmental protection or improvement
# the relief of those in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage
# the advancement of animal welfare
# the promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown or of the police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services
# other purposes currently recognized as charitable and any new charitable purposes which are similar to another charitable purpose.

A charity must also provide a public benefit.

Before the Charities Act 2006, which introduced the definition now contained in the 2011 Act, the definition of charity arose from a list of charitable purposes in the Charitable Uses Act 1601 (also known as the Statute of Elizabeth), which had been interpreted and expanded into a considerable body of case law. In &quot;Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel&quot; (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006:
# the relief of poverty,
# the advancement of education,
# the advancement of religion, and
# other purposes considered beneficial to the community.

Charities in England and Wales—such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) – must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.

=====Structures=====
, there are several types of legal structures for a charity in England and Wales:
* Unincorporated association
* Trust
* Company limited by guarantee
* Another incorporation, such as by royal charter
* Charitable incorporated organization

The unincorporated association is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales. This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have a constitution or set of rules as its governing document, which will deal with matters such as the appointment of office bearers and the rules governing membership. The organization is not, however, a separate legal entity, so it cannot initiate legal action, borrow money, or enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.

A trust is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, like an unincorporated association, it lacks a separate legal entity, and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.

A company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where members&#x27; liability is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors rather than shareholders. If the company is wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum, which can be as little as £1. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where trustees need limited liability protection. Moreover, the charity has legal personality and can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts, in its own name.

A small number of charities are incorporated by royal charter, a document that creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some cases, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the Privy Council before receiving royal assent. While the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, a royal charter generally offers a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.

The Charities Act 2006 introduced a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities—the charitable incorporated organization (CIO)—with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with the highest turnover eligible first.

The term &quot;foundation&quot; is not commonly used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name (e.g., British Heart Foundation), but this has no legal significance and provides no information about the charity&#x27;s work or legal structure. The organization&#x27;s structure will fall into one of the types described above.

=====Registration=====
Charitable organizations with an income of over £5,000 and subject to the law of England and Wales must register with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, unless they are an &quot;exempt&quot; or &quot;excepted&quot; charity. For companies, the law of England and Wales will usually apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales. In other cases, if the governing document doesn&#x27;t specify, the law that applies will be the one most connected with the organization.

When an organization&#x27;s income doesn&#x27;t exceed £5,000, it can&#x27;t register as a charity with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, unless registered as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation, in which case there is no minimum annual income. With the increase in the mandatory registration level to £5,000 by The Charities Act 2006, smaller charities can rely on HMRC recognition to demonstrate their charitable purpose and confirm their not-for-profit principles.

Churches with an annual income of less than £100,000 need not register.

Some charities, referred to as exempt charities, aren&#x27;t required to register with the Charity Commission and aren&#x27;t subject to its supervisory powers. These charities include most universities and national museums, as well as some other educational institutions. Other charities are excepted from the need to register but are still subject to the supervision of the Charity Commission. The regulations on excepted charities were changed by the Charities Act 2006. Many excepted charities are religious charities.

====Northern Ireland====
The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland was established in 2009 and has received the names and details of over 7,000 organizations in Northern Ireland that have previously been granted charitable status for tax purposes (the &quot;deemed list&quot;). Compulsory registration of organizations from the deemed list began in December 2013, and it is expected to take three to four years to complete. The new Register of Charities is publicly available on the CCNI website and contains the details of those organizations that have so far been confirmed by the commission to exist for charitable purposes and the public benefit. The Commission estimates that between 5,000 and 11,500 charitable organizations need to be formally registered in total.

====Scotland====
The approximately 24,000 charities in Scotland are registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), which also maintains a register of charities online.

===United States===

In the United States, a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the public interest. There are different types of charitable organizations. Every U.S. and foreign charity that qualifies as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is considered a &quot;private foundation&quot; unless it demonstrates to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that it falls into another category. Generally, any organization that is not a private foundation (i.e., it qualifies as something else) is usually a public charity as described in Section 509(a) of the IRC.

In addition, a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual, family, corporation, or some other single source, and it is more often than not a grantmaker that does not solicit funds from the public. In contrast, a foundation or public charity generally receives grants from individuals, government, and private foundations. While some public charities engage in grantmaking activities, most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities. Foundations that are generally grantmakers (i.e., they use their endowment to make grants to other organizations, which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly) are usually called &quot;grantmaker&quot; or &quot;non-operating&quot; foundations.

The requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state, as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities, solicit charitable contributions, or hire professional fundraisers. In practice, the detailed definition of a &quot;charitable organization&quot; is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates, and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS.

Resources exist to provide information, including rankings, of US charities.

====Federal tax relief====
Federal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. The benefits of 501(c)(3) status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions. In 2017, there were a total of $281.86 billion in tax-deductible donations by individuals.

To qualify for 501(c)(3) status, most organizations must apply to the IRS for such status.

Several requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association. The organization&#x27;s organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities, such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state, or federal office. Additionally, the organization must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual. Most tax-exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports (IRS Form 990) at the state and federal level. A tax-exempt organization&#x27;s Form 990 and some other forms are required to be made available for public scrutiny.

The types of charitable organizations that the IRS considers to be organized for the public benefit include those organized for:
* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged
* Advancement of religion
* Advancement of education or science
* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works
* Lessening the burdens of government
* Lessening neighborhood tensions
* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination
* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law
* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.

A number of other organizations may also qualify for exempt status, including those organized for religious, scientific, literary, and educational purposes, as well as those for testing for public safety and for fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.

== Criticism ==
The charitable sector has received various criticisms, notably:

* It is often biased toward helping beneficiaries that are spatially close, typically in the same country, even when more effective interventions could be implemented elsewhere. Similarly, it tends to focus on current humans, neglecting opportunities to help future generations or other species.
* Charities are not strongly incentivized to be highly effective, notably due to biases and lack of research from donors. One common issue is scope neglect: emotional responses don&#x27;t scale linearly with the number of beneficiaries helped. A 2020 study reported that laypeople estimated the most cost-effective charities for saving lives to be between 1.5 and 2 times more effective than the average one, whereas experts estimated them to be 100 times more effective.
* Charities sometimes give aid conditionally, through eligibility requirements such as sobriety, piety, curfews, participation in job training or parenting courses, cooperation with the police, or identifying the paternity of children, charity models enforce the concept that only those who can prove their moral worth deserve help, motivating citizens to accept exploitative wages or conditions to avoid being subject to the charitable system.
* Charity is increasingly privatized and contracted out to the massive nonprofit sector, where organizations compete for grants to address social problems. Donors can protect their money from taxation by storing it in foundations that fund their pet projects, some of which have nothing to do with poor people.

Economist Robert Reich criticized the practice of billionaires giving some of their money to charity, calling it mostly &quot;self-serving rubbish&quot;. Mathew Snow of American socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot; criticized charity for &quot;creating an individualized &#x27;culture of giving&#x27;&quot; instead of &quot;challenging capitalism&#x27;s institutionalized taking.&quot;

<doc id="1176688" wikidata="Q443540" url="?curid=1176688" title="Ollie Johnston">
<text>Oliver Martin Johnston Jr. (October 31, 1912 – April 14, 2008) was an American motion picture animator. He was one of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, and the last surviving at the time of his death from natural causes. He was recognized by The Walt Disney Company with its Disney Legend Award in 1989. His work was recognized with the National Medal of Arts in 2005.

==Career==
Johnston was an animator at Walt Disney Studios from 1934 to 1978, and became a directing animator beginning with &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, released in 1940. He contributed to most Disney animated features, including &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot;. His last full work for Disney came with &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, in which he was caricatured as one of the film&#x27;s characters, the cat Rufus. The last film he worked on was &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;. His work includes Mr. Smee (in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;), the Stepsisters (in &quot;Cinderella&quot;), the District Attorney (in &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;), and Prince John (in &quot;Robin Hood&quot;). According to the book &quot;The Disney Villain&quot;, written by Johnston and Frank Thomas, Johnston also partnered with Thomas on creating characters such as Ichabod Crane (in &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;), Sir Hiss (in &quot;Robin Hood&quot;), and story consultant in &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot;.

Johnston co-authored, with Frank Thomas, the reference book &quot;Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life&quot;, which contained the 12 basic principles of animation. This book helped preserve the knowledge of the techniques that were developed at the studio. The partnership of Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston is fondly presented in the documentary &quot;Frank and Ollie&quot;, produced by Thomas&#x27; son Theodore, who in 2012 also produced another documentary, &quot;Growing up with Nine Old Men&quot;, included in the Diamond Edition of the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; DVD.

==Personal life==

Born in Palo Alto, California, to Oliver, a Stanford professor, and Florence Johnston, Johnston had two older sisters, Winifred and Florence. Johnston attended Palo Alto High School and Stanford University, where he worked on the campus humor magazine &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot; with fellow future animator Frank Thomas, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. Johnston then transferred to the Chouinard Art Institute in his senior year. Johnston married a fellow Disney employee, ink and paint artist Marie Worthey, in 1943. Marie Johnston died May 20, 2005, at the age of 87.

Johnston&#x27;s lifelong hobby was live steam trains. Starting in 1949, he built the gauge La Cañada Valley Railroad, a miniature backyard railroad with three 1:12-scale locomotives at his home in Flintridge, California. The locomotives are now owned by his sons. This railroad was one of the inspirations for Walt Disney to build his own backyard railroad, the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, which inspired the building of the railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Johnston was a founding Governor of the Carolwood Pacific Historical Society along with his fellow Disney animator and railfan, Ward Kimball. The 1:4-scale Victorian depot from Johnston&#x27;s backyard was restored and moved to a location near Walt Disney&#x27;s Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in Griffith Park, Los Angeles.

In the 1960s, Johnston acquired and restored a full-size, narrow gauge Porter steam locomotive originally built in 1901, which he named the &quot;Marie E.&quot; He also built the Deer Lake Park &amp; Julian Railroad (DLP&amp;J) at his vacation estate in Julian, California, to run the locomotive with a small gondola and caboose pulled behind it. The &quot;Marie E.&quot; first ran on the DLP&amp;J in 1968. the DLP&amp;J was long and utilized the railroad ties from the defunct Viewliner Train of Tomorrow attraction in Disneyland. Johnston sold the vacation estate and the narrow gauge train in 1993. The engine and its consist were later sold to John Lasseter (of Pixar Studios fame) around 2002. On May 10, 2005, it ran on the Disneyland Railroad during a private early morning event organized by Lasseter to honor Johnston, who was able to take the throttle of the &quot;Marie E.&quot; one last time. This was the first time that the Walt Disney Company permitted outside railroad equipment to run at any Disney Resort. The engine is still fully operational and presently runs on the Justi Creek Railway, located within the vineyards of Lasseter Family Winery, also owned by Lasseter.

In the 1980s and 90s, Johnston served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute and often was a presenter at the annual film festival&#x27;s award ceremonies. Brad Bird paid a tribute to Ollie Johnston with an animated cameo of Johnston in the 2004 Pixar film &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, as well as a cameo in his 1999 film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, where Johnston played a train engineer. Both cameos also included Frank Thomas.

On November 10, 2005, Ollie Johnston was among the recipients of the prestigious National Medal of Arts, presented by President George W. Bush in an Oval Office ceremony.

Ollie Johnston died of natural causes on April 14, 2008, at the age of 95. He was the last surviving member of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men at the time of his death.

<doc id="1176689" wikidata="Q5639166" url="?curid=1176689" title="Hail! Minnesota">
<text>&quot;Hail! Minnesota&quot; (also simply called &quot;Minnesota&quot; in early years) is the regional anthem (or &quot;state song&quot;) of the U.S. state of Minnesota. A variation is used as a school song of the University of Minnesota. It originated at the university in the early 20th century when some students decided to honor their graduating class with a new song. In 1945, the Minnesota State Legislature approved the tune as the state song.

==History==
The song was first composed by Truman Rickard, a student at the University of Minnesota, in 1904. It was first performed on May 28, Class Day. The song&#x27;s second verse originally honored the school&#x27;s president, Cyrus Northrop, who went by the nickname &quot;Prexy&quot;. Northrop appreciated the gesture but preferred to have the song reflect the school and state rather than himself. A new second verse was written by Arthur Upson, an editor at the campus newspaper, the &quot;Minnesota Daily&quot;.

In the next few years, the song gained popularity and was even sung at football games whenever there was a touchdown. However, the slow ballad proved to be incongruous with the atmosphere at an athletic event like that, so it was eventually succeeded in that role by The &quot;Minnesota Rouser.&quot; Rickard also went on to write another school song, &quot;Minnesota Fight.&quot;

The University of Minnesota Marching Band sings the song at the end of every practice and performance, so Golden Gopher football fans who stay for the band&#x27;s post-game performance can hear the song. On &quot;Senior Day&quot; (final hockey home game of the season) the Gopher Hockey Pep Band serenades departing seniors after the game.

Older generations of Minnesotan children were taught the song in school, but this practice has waned. However, the song was promoted again as part of the state sesquicentennial celebration in 2008, with the Mahtomedi High School Chamber Singers making an official recording of it in 2006 for the Secretary of State.

<text>Dikirion () and trikirion (τρικήριον or τρίκηρον) are liturgical candlesticks, used by a bishop of the Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic Churches to bless the clergy and . The words mean &quot;dual candle&quot; and &quot;triple candle&quot;, respectively, and may collectively be called by the Greek plural form, &quot;δικηροτρίκηρα&quot;, &quot;dikērotríkēra&quot;.

The candlesticks are often quite ornate. The bishop holds the trikirion in his right hand and the dikirion in his left, and makes the Sign of the Cross with both.

Both the dikirion and the trikirion have flat bases, so that they may stand upright. Above this base is a vertical shaft terminating in candleholders. The dikirion holds two candles, representing the dual nature of Jesus, and the trikirion holds three, representing the three persons of the Holy Trinity. The candleholders are mounted at an angle so that candles placed in them cross each other. Sometimes in the Russian tradition, the candles are inserted into their holders, then softened then shaped in such a way that the separate candles meet and bend upwards to burn with a single flame. A particularly fancy variation on this has the candles merge in a double and triple spiral. In other traditions, the candles are tied together with large ribbons at the point of intersection.

During a hierarchical Divine Liturgy, the dikirion and trikirion are kept respectively on the top left and right corners of the Holy Table (altar), or on stands placed next to these corners. When these are needed by the bishop, the candlesticks are brought to him by subdeacons, who may also carry them during the Entrances. One of them may be carried by the deacon during the censing by the bishop or by one of the subdeacons during the censing by the deacon.

==Paschal trikirion==

There exists a special form of the trikirion used only at Pascha (Easter) - the Paschal trikirion (Slavonic: Троица, &quot;Troitsa&quot;). This Paschal form of the trikirion is carried by priests as well as bishops, and sometimes will have coloured candles in it (for instance, red, green and gold).

==Theophany==

Among the Ukrainian Eastern Christians (Russian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic), it is common for the priest or bishop to use a large three-branch candle for the Great Blessing of Waters on the Great Feast of Theophany (Epiphany).

<doc id="1176697" wikidata="Q5029216" url="?curid=1176697" title="Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame">
<text>Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame, based in The Hangar Flight Museum in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, commemorates and honours those whose accomplishments in aviation contributed so much to Canada&#x27;s development as a nation. Founded in 1973, the Hall of Fame has honoured thus far more than 200 aviators, engineers, technicians and administrators.

Due to its size and geographical location, Canada has had to rely upon aviation much more than other countries. With so much territory unsuitable for surface travel, it was up to aviation to unite the country and bring the distant regions the opportunities for social and economic progress that would make them part of Canada. The unique combination of pioneering aviation and pioneering development of the country resulted in many outstanding examples of heroism, skill, tenacity, courage, wisdom, and luck, and many great stories to be told. The best of these stories are described in the Aviation Hall of Fame.

Stories are told on four by eight foot panels with portraits, citations, photographs, and memorabilia. The Hall has an extensive collection of personal items and memorabilia related to inducted members, including such material as licenses, logbooks, uniforms, insignia, medals, trophies and awards, documents, correspondence, scrapbooks and photographs. The reference library contains approximately 2,500 books and over 12,000 periodicals related specifically to Canadian aviation. Items are loaned to other museums in Canada for exhibit purposes, and may be accessed by researchers and visitors, by appointment.

The Hall of Fame also awards the Belt of Orion and the Order of Polaris each year at its annual induction dinner, to an organization notable for its contribution to Canadian aviation.

==History==

Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame was incorporated August 2, 1973. The 79 original members included all Companions of the Order of Icarus, all who had been awarded the Trans-Canada (McKee) Trophy, all recipients of the Victoria Cross in aerial combat, Alexander Graham Bell and F.W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin for designing and building the Silver Dart, and Group Captain John Emilius Fauquier representing the Second World War RAF Bomber Command and Flight Lieutenant George Frederick &quot;Buzz&quot; Beurling representing the Second World War RAF Fighter Command. A confidential nomination review committee reviews nominations for new members of the Hall of Fame, looking for contributions of major benefit to Canada which have stood the test of time.

The Hall of Fame officially opened on the first day of Klondike Days, July 17, 1974, in the Sportex Building at the Edmonton Exhibition Grounds. During the initial years it moved several times until finally residing in the Edmonton Convention Centre for several years. When the Reynolds-Alberta Museum opened near Wetaskiwin, Alberta, in 1992, the Hall of Fame moved to the museum&#x27;s aviation hangar, combining and merging its exhibits with the museum&#x27;s extensive aviation collection.

In 2022, the hall of fame relocated to The Hangar Flight Museum in Calgary.

<doc id="1176699" wikidata="Q3057837" url="?curid=1176699" title="Escaline">
<text>Escaline (3,5-methoxy-4-ethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic drug and entheogen of the phenethylamine class of compounds. Escaline was first synthesized and reported in the scientific literature by Benington, et al., in 1954, but was later re-examined in the laboratory of David E. Nichols, who prepared a series of mescaline analogues that included escaline, proscaline, and isoproscaline. The effects of this and related mescaline analogues in humans were first described by Alexander Shulgin. In his book &quot;PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as 40 to 60 mg of hydrochloride salt, consumed orally. The duration of action was stated to be 8–12 hours.

Escaline is the phenethylamine analog of 3C-E and the 4-ethoxy analog of mescaline.

== Legal status ==
Escaline is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.

Escaline is a Schedule I controlled substance (DEA #7930) in the United States as it is a positional isomer of TMA (3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine).

<doc id="1176717" wikidata="Q332334" url="?curid=1176717" title="Gummo">
<text>Gummo is a 1997 American experimental drama film written and directed by Harmony Korine (in his directorial debut), and stars Linda Manz, Max Perlich, Jacob Reynolds, Chloë Sevigny, Jacob Sewell, and Nick Sutton. The film is set in Xenia, Ohio, a Midwestern American town that had been previously struck by a devastating tornado. The loose narrative follows several main characters who find odd and destructive ways to pass time, interrupted by vignettes depicting other inhabitants of the town.

&quot;Gummo&quot; was shot in Nashville, Tennessee, on an estimated budget of $1.3 million. It was not given a large theatrical release and failed to generate large box office revenues. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, and generated substantial press for its graphic content and stylized, loosely woven narrative. The film has become a cult classic, and entered The Criterion Collection in 2024.

==Plot==
A young boy named Solomon narrates the events of the tornado that devastated the city of Xenia, Ohio. A mute adolescent boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts, and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain.

A boy carries a cat by the scruff of its neck and drowns it in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with Tummler — a friend of Solomon — in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl&#x27;s breasts. Tummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. In narration, Solomon describes Tummler as a boy with &quot;a marvelous persona&quot;, whom some people call &quot;downright evil&quot;.

Later, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a housecat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners&#x27; house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two of whom are teenagers and one who is pre-pubescent. The film cuts back to Tummler and Solomon hunting feral cats, which they deliver to a local grocer who intends to butcher and sell them to a local restaurant. The grocer tells them that they have a rival in the cat-killing business. Tummler and Solomon buy glue from the grocer, which they use to get high via huffing.

The film then cuts to a scene in which two foul-mouthed young boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy arrives and the other boys pretend to shoot him dead with cap guns. Bunny Boy plays dead and the boys curse at his corpse, rifle through his pockets, then remove and throw one of his shoes. They grow bored with this and leave Bunny Boy sprawled on the ground.

Tummler and Solomon track down a local boy who is poaching &quot;their&quot; cats. The poacher, named Jarrod Wiggley, is poisoning the cats rather than shooting them. When Tummler and Solomon break into Jarrod&#x27;s house with masks and weapons with intent to hurt him, they find photos of the young teen cross-dressing and his elderly grandmother, who is catatonic and attached to life support machinery. Jarrod is forced to care for her, which he had earlier opined was &quot;disgusting&quot;. Seeing that Jarrod is not home, Tummler and Solomon decide to leave. Tummler then discovers the grandmother lying in her bed, states that it is &quot;no way to live&quot;, and turns off the life support machine.

A number of other scenes are interspersed throughout the film, including: an intoxicated man (played by Korine) flirting with a male dwarf; a man pimping his disabled sister to Solomon and Tummler; the sisters encountering an elderly child molester; a pair of twin boys selling candy door-to-door; a brief conversation with a tennis player who is treating his ADD; a long scene of Solomon eating dinner while taking a bath in dirty water; a drunken party with arm- and chair-wrestling; and two skinhead brothers boxing each other in their kitchen. There are also a number of even smaller scenes depicting Satanic rituals, footage seemingly from home movies, and conversations containing racial bigotry.

The next scene in the movie is set to the song &quot;Crying&quot; by Roy Orbison, which had been previously mentioned by Tummler as the song his older sibling, who was transgender, would sing (the sibling eventually went to the &quot;Big City&quot; and abandoned him). It begins with Bunny Boy kissing the teenage sisters in a swimming pool, then cuts to Solomon and Tummler shooting the sisters&#x27; cat repeatedly with their air rifles in the rain. After showing some home video footage of tornadoes, it cuts to Bunny Boy running towards the camera through a field holding the body of the dead cat, which he shows to the audience, breaking the fourth wall.

The final scene shows a girl, who shaved her eyebrows earlier in the movie, singing &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; in bed next to her mom (or sister). The film finally cuts to black as the girl singing is told to &quot;dial it down&quot; and go to bed.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
In writing &quot;Gummo&quot;, Harmony Korine abandoned traditional three-act plot structure and worked to avoid creating characters of a clear-cut moral dimension. In favor of a collage-like assembly, Korine focused on forming interesting moments and scenes, that when put in succession would become its own unique narrative. To justify such a chaotic assembly, Korine set his film in Xenia, Ohio which had been hit by a tornado in 1974.

To help him achieve his vision, Korine sought out French cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier. His work on &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot; (1991) made a tremendous impression on Korine. Escoffier, who liked the script, worked on &quot;Gummo&quot; for a fraction of his usual rate.

During the months of pre-production, Korine scouted for locations in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, finding unusual and distinctive homes to shoot in. Korine often approached people on the street, in bowling alleys and in fast food restaurants and asked them to play a part in his movie. Korine notes, &quot;This is where I grew up. These people are interesting to me, and I&#x27;d never seen them represented on screen in a true way.&quot;

Korine&#x27;s then-girlfriend Chloë Sevigny, who also starred in the film, served as costume designer, mixing pieces that people already owned with items bought at local thrift stores.

The title is an oblique reference to Gummo Marx, the only one of the Marx Brothers who never made a film. As Kim Newman wrote in &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Not only is he not mentioned in this movie, but there&#x27;s no alternative explanation given for his name as the choice of title.&quot; According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;The filmmaker told a Toronto Film Festival crowd that movie titles shouldn’t have any bearing on the content, so he named his film &quot;Gummo&quot; after the fifth Marx Brother, who Korine claimed was a particularly well-endowed cross-dresser.&quot;

===Casting===
Korine cast the film almost entirely with local non-actors. Old friends were eager to help Korine, such as the two skinhead brothers, skateboarder Mark Gonzales, and dwarf Bryant Krenshaw. Professional actors include Sevigny, Linda Manz, and Max Perlich.

On Linda Manz, Korine stated, &quot;I had always admired her. There was this sense about her that I liked – it wasn&#x27;t even acting. It was like the way I felt about Buster Keaton when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow. They both burnt off the screen.&quot; &quot;Gummo&quot; was her first screen appearance in 16 years.

Korine spotted his two main characters while watching cable television. Korine noticed Jacob Reynolds in a short role in &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; (1994). &quot;He was so visual... I never get tired of looking at his face.&quot; The character of Solomon, played by Reynolds, is described in Korine&#x27;s script as looking &quot;like no other kid in the world.&quot;

Nick Sutton, who plays Tummler, was spotted on a drug prevention episode of &quot;The Sally Jesse Raphael Show&quot; called &quot;My Child Died From Sniffing Paint&quot;. In the show Sutton is asked where he thinks he will be in a few years, to which he responds, &quot;I&#x27;ll probably be dead.&quot; Recalls Korine, &quot;I saw his face and I thought that was the boy I dreamed of, that was my Tummler. There was a beauty about him.&quot; Of Sutton, producer Scott Macaulay stated, &quot;He&#x27;s this person that Harmony sort of found and put in the middle of this movie, which is at times realistic and at times magical. I think of Nick as being Harmony&#x27;s equivalent of Herzog&#x27;s Bruno S.&quot;

Korine cast his actors not by how they read lines, but by the visual aura they put off.

===Filming===
The film was shot in some of Nashville&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods. Producer Cary Woods comments, &quot;we&#x27;re essentially seeing the kind of poverty that we&#x27;re used to seeing in Third World countries when news crews are covering famines, [but] seeing that in the heart of America.&quot; One small home housed fifteen people and several thousand cockroaches. Bugs literally crawled up and down the walls. Korine comments, &quot;we had to take out stuff to be able to put the camera in the room.&quot; At times, the crew rebelled against filming in such conditions and Korine was forced to purchase hazmat suits for them to wear. Korine and Escoffier, who thought this was offensive and disrespectful to the residents of the houses, &quot;wore Speedos and flip-flops just to piss them off.&quot;

Korine encouraged improvisation and spontaneity. To achieve this, Korine had to establish a mode of trust. &quot;If an actor is a crack smoker, let him go out between takes, smoke crack, and then come back and throw his refrigerator out the window! Let people feel they can do whatever they want with no consequence.&quot; Producer Scott Macaulay commented the improvisational methods yielded deep results for everyone involved. &quot;For a lot of the non-actors, you sensed that it was a very emotional experience for them, and that they were tapping into something important.&quot; Korine adds, &quot;I wanted to show what it was like to sniff glue. I didn&#x27;t want to judge anybody. This is why I have very little interest in working with actors. [Non-actors] can give you what an actor can never give you: pieces of themselves.&quot;

On the last day of shooting, Escoffier shot the chair-wrestling kitchen scene alone with a rigged boom on his camera. Some people had just gotten out of prison and Korine felt the performance would be greater if he wasn&#x27;t in the room. The crew shut all the doors and turned off all the monitors, so no one knew what was going on. In between takes, Korine would run in and get everyone hyped up. At the end of the scene there is a moment of silence where no one knows what to do next. Korine comments, &quot;When I saw that in the dailies, it amazed me, because Jean Yves really captured that awkwardness, that sad silence; it was beautiful.&quot;

Korine shot &quot;Gummo&quot; in just four weeks during the summer of 1996, most of the film being shot on the final week of production. This was due to the crew waiting for rain. The last scene shot is the one with Korine starring as a heavily intoxicated boy on a couch with a dwarf.

Any scenes appearing to show violence against animals were simulated, sometimes using prosthetic animals.

===Editing===
Korine worked with editor Christopher Tellefsen to synthesize the pre-planned footage with the &quot;mistake-ist&quot; footage:
Korine said that he used footage from any source he could find that fit the aesthetic: &quot;That cat tape was a tape that a friend of mine had given me, of him doing acid with his sister. They were in a garage band and there was a shot of their kitten. That [phasing] was an in-camera mistake.&quot; The final film is about 75% scripted.

==Music==

&quot;Gummo&quot;″s soundtrack paints a wide canvas of American pop-culture, ranging from Almeda Riddle&#x27;s field recording of the traditional children&#x27;s song &quot;My Little Rooster&quot;, to the doom metal of the California band Sleep. Other popular songs include Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot; and Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Crying&quot;, which closes the film and is directly referenced in the dialogue.

Metal and powerviolence bands such as Bethlehem, Mystifier, Absu, Burzum, Bathory, Brujeria, Eyehategod and Spazz are also featured.

==Themes==
The film explores a broad range of issues including drug abuse, violence, homicide, vandalism, mental illness, poverty, profanity, homophobia, sexual abuse, sexism, racism, suicide, grief, prostitution, and animal cruelty. Korine avoided any romantic notions regarding America, including its poor and mentally disabled.

Korine comments on the film&#x27;s pop-aesthetic, saying: &quot;America is all about this recycling, this interpretation of pop. I want you to see these kids wearing Bone Thugs &amp; Harmony t-shirts and Metallica hats – this almost schizophrenic identification with popular imagery. If you think about, that&#x27;s how people relate to each other these days, through these images.&quot; Dot and Helen are modeled after Cherie Currie. &quot;I wanted them to seem like homeschool kids... sort of guessing and coming up with these hipster things. They almost make a homeschool hip language. I wanted this inbred vernacular.&quot;

The film has a strong vaudevillian influence. The name of the character Tummler is taken directly from the vaudevillian term given to lower-level comics of the day. &quot;The guys that would check you into a hotel room, take your coat, and at the same time throw a few one-liners out. They&#x27;re like the warm-up, the lowest level comedian. The tummler.&quot; (See Borscht Belt)

Producer Robin O&#x27;Hara argues that while people naturally look for points of reference to describe &quot;Gummo&quot; (such as Herzog, Cassavetes, Arbus, Fellini, Godard, Maysles and Jarman) that Korine&#x27;s art really is his own. &quot;He is an original, in every sense of the word.&quot; Korine comments on the film&#x27;s aesthetic: &quot;We tried very hard not to reference other films. We wanted &quot;Gummo&quot; to set its own standard.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Gummo&quot; premiered at the 24th Telluride Film Festival on August 29, 1997. During the screening, several people walked out the theater during the opening sequence when the cat is drowned by one of the protagonists. Several festival appearances followed including International Film Festival Rotterdam where it won the KNF Award for &quot;best feature film in the official section that does not yet have distribution within the Netherlands,&quot; and Venice Film Festival where it received a special mention from the FIPRESCI jury. It was picked up for distribution by Fine Line Features, and saw a limited release with an R rating (edited from the original NC-17 version) in the United States on October 17, 1997 for pervasive depiction of anti-social behavior of juveniles, including violence, substance abuse, sexuality and language.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Gummo&quot; received generally mixed to negative reviews upon its initial release, with a 39% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, and an average rating of 6.0/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states &quot;&quot;Gummo&quot;″s bold provocations may impress more iconoclastically inclined viewers, but others will find it hard to see past writer-director Harmony Korine&#x27;s overwhelmingly sour storytelling perspective.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 19 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike.&quot;

Werner Herzog praised the film and talked about being impressed by the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene.

Director Lukas Moodysson listed it as one of his top ten films for the 2002 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Poll and Australian director Megan Spencer also praised the film. David Stratton of SBS&#x27;s &quot;The Movie Show&quot; stated in his review that &quot;cat lovers should be warned&quot;, but ultimately praised the film, calling it &quot;original&quot;.

Filmmaker Gus Van Sant on &quot;Gummo&quot; writes, &quot;Venomous in story; genius in character; victorious in structure; teasingly gentle in epilogue; slapstick in theme; rebellious in nature; honest at heart; inspirational in its creation and with contempt at the tip of its tongue, [&quot;Gummo&quot;] is a portrait of small-town Middle American life that is both bracingly realistic and hauntingly dreamlike.&quot;

A short excerpt from &quot;Gummo&quot; was shown after the opening sequence in the 1998 film &quot;Belly&quot;.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Gummo&quot; was released on VHS following its theatrical release and on DVD in 2001. As of 2019, it was unavailable on any streaming service or for digital purchase. It was released on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 22, 2024 by The Criterion Collection.

==&quot;The Diary of Anne Frank Pt. II&quot;==

&quot;The Diary of Anne Frank Pt. II&quot; is a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring the same actors and themes as &quot;Gummo&quot;, and can be considered a companion piece.

Korine comments, &quot;I could probably make another two movies with the excess footage [from &quot;Gummo&quot;]. Some of this material I&#x27;m going to use in this art work... the problem you run into doing multimedia projection is that a lot of the time, the style takes over. It threatens and reduces the content. It becomes almost like a music video – mixing all these forms for no reason.&quot;
