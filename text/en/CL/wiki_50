<text>Kaingaroa Forest covers of the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand, and is the largest forest plantation in New Zealand, and the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere (after the Sabie/Graskop plantation in South Africa). The forest stretches from Lake Taupō in the south to Kawerau to the north and has roughly 20 million trees. The headquarters of the forest are at the small settlement of Kaingaroa, Bay of Plenty, southeast of Rotorua. Prior to planting the area was a tussock and scrub plateau (ranging between high), formed on volcanic ash.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;long area of land&quot; for &quot;Kāingaroa&quot;.

The forest was first planted in the late 1920s and owned as a state asset by the New Zealand government. Experimental planting of douglas fir and radiata pine began on a block at Kaingaroa in 1901 and continued from 1906 using Waiotapu prison labour. By 1932 the pines averaged high and in diameter. Later planting was as an unemployment relief scheme. While under government control it was known as the Kaingaroa State Forest.

In the 1980s the government sought to sell the forests to private interests. Several Māori iwi went to Court to prevent the sale, arguing that they were the traditional owners of the land, that the land had been wrongfully taken from them, and that the government should retain the land until a settlement of the claims had been reached. It has taken 20 years to reach settlement of those claims and to see the forest lands returned to their traditional owners. On 1 July 2009, it passed to a group of tribes that were the traditional land owners in partial settlement of their claims that the Crown breached the Treaty of Waitangi. The forests themselves (the trees) continue to be owned by a private company (Kaingaroa Timberlands Ltd), which holds a forestry licence over the land.

New Zealand State Highway 38, from Wai-O-Tapu to Murupara crosses the forest.

<text>Isabella Andreini (born Isabella Canali; 156210 June 1604), also known as Isabella Da Padova, was an Italian actress and writer. Andreini was a member of the Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi, a touring theatre company that performed in Italy and France. The role of Isabella of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; was named after her.

==Life==

Isabella Canali was born in Padua to Venetian parents. Although her family was poor, Andreini received a complete classical education. She was very interested in literary culture and became fluent in several languages which she put to use in her &quot;La Pazzia d&#x27;Isabella&quot; (The Divine Madness of Isabella).

In 1576, at age fourteen, Andreini was hired by the troupe of Flaminio Scala, the Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi. The Gelosi was a well-established theatre company that performed c&quot;ommedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. The Gelosi were patronized by the aristocracy of northern Italy, usually performing for the gentry of Italy and France. Henry III of France was fond of the troupe, and Andreini performed for him in those very early years.

From the beginning, Andreini particularly performed the role of the enamored woman, the &quot;prima donna innamorata&quot;, and she improvised to create a character that was less dull and more perceptive. She began to improvise and eventually shaped the art form into one of comedic bits and spontaneity. She was one of the women who introduced, developed, and excelled at improvisation. She was daring for the time, sometimes taking off or tearing her clothes onstage. Additionally, Andreini was recognized for her acting flexibility, an important skill for all &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; characters, regardless of sex. Andreini played the power dynamics for comedy in her characters; she recognized the importance of her status as the leading actress in a new profession. Andreini worked with the Gelosi until her death.

In 1578, Andreini met and married Francesco Andreini, non-traditionally taking his last name, who would become the director of the Gelosi (1589). Andreini became both the leading lady and an important voice within the Gelosi company. Together with her husband, she managed the troupe&#x27;s activities and negotiated with potential patrons.

Andreini bore seven children, three boys and four girls, while touring in the Gelosi, and was a dedicated mother. While her firstborn son, Giambattista, continued the theatrical tradition, her other male children were raised by the aristocracy of Mantua, one to become clergy in Italian monasteries, and the other son to become a guard of a duke. She was committed in her duties to motherhood and as wife to Francesco Andreini.

In 1589, Andreini performed her comic work &quot;La Pazzia d&#x27;Isabella&quot; (&quot;Isabella&#x27;s madness&quot;) for the Florentine court during the wedding of Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici and Christina of Lorraine, and the details of the mostly improvised play have survived to modern times. Fluent in several languages, she was renowned for her intellectual presentation and refined presence. In this play, she creates madness by using several languages and then imitating the dialects of the other characters. She was versatile in her craft and even referred to herself as being capable of playing any male role. She created the role of Fabrizio, a character used in many of Flaminio Scala&#x27;s scenarios, where she plays a cross-dressing pageboy. Andreini was noted as having played three different characters in one scenario, showcasing her improvisation skills and her talent.

In 1599, Andreini performed before Henry IV, King of France, and his wife Marie de&#x27; Medici. By this point, Andreini was well known enough to be addressed as the &quot;star&quot; performer of the troupe, referred to by Maria de Medici in a letter as &quot;the actress Isabella and her company&quot;.

Andreini performed at least once for two other troupes: the Confidenti of the Duke of Mantua in 1589, and the Uniti in 1601.

In 1602, Andreini toured northern Italy, and in 1603 performed again for Henry IV, Marie de&#x27; Medici and a local audience at Fontainebleau and Paris. This would be her last tour, because early in 1604 she died near Lyon, on her way back to Italy, when she miscarried her eighth child at age 42. After her state funeral, memorial coins were made in her honour, with one side representing her as a powerful Roman ruler and the other side featuring the Roman goddess Fame and the words &quot;aeterna&quot; &quot;fama&quot;.

Although Francesco Andreini dissolved the Gelosi after her death, their son Giambattista Andreini, who was an actor and a playwright, started his own company, the Fedeli, with the original troupe of the Gelosi.

==Literary works==
Beside performing on stage, Isabella Andreini was a recognized intellectual who dedicated much of her time to literature. The themes of her plays were shaded with some notions questioning the situation of the woman in the society of that epoch; she wrote with a masculine voice in her creations that showed her virtue. She is considered one of the more successful female playwrights of her time, which is attributed to her time on stage as an actress. In one of her most notable works, &quot;La Mirtilla&quot; (1588), Andreini was able to address controversial and taboo topics regarding women and queerness. Through this play, she addresses the power, self-awareness, and independence of women as well as deep and supportive female relationships. Further, she explores the idea of lesbianism through the character of Ardelia. She was able to intertwine proto-feminist ideas of gender and sexuality while meeting the complicated theatrical elements of pastoral dramas. Other female playwrights also started to introduce these ideas; however, Andreini&#x27;s golden reputation and growing popularity allowed her to address these topics without the repercussions. Thus, she was able to use her large platform to bring light to the matter.

Indeed, after publishing &quot;Mirtilla,&quot; she began corresponding with contemporary intellectuals, attending their forums, and – an uncommon achievement for a woman in her era – in 1601 she was integrated into the literary society of the &quot;Accademia degli Intenti&quot; of Pavia, for which she adopted the nickname of &quot;Accesa.&quot; In a poetry contest held by the Cardinal Giorgio Cinthio Aldobrandini of Rome, Isabella Andreini attained second place, only behind the Renaissance poet Torquato Tasso. Like Tasso, both Gabriello Chiabrera and Giambattista Marino have praised her.

Some may argue that Andreini&#x27;s writings were just as impressive if not far more impressive than her theatrical performances on the stage. Andreini highlighted subjects in her literary works that were not only extremely taboo but often severely ill explored. Andreini highlighted self-expression, erotic nature, gender identity, and sexuality in several of her pieces; the most famous piece being &quot;Rime D&#x27;Isabella Andreini Padouana Comica Gelosa&quot;, which highlights the eroticization of madness through a focus on sexuality and the body.

Apart from writing plays, Isabella also wrote poetry and corresponded with a great variety of people.

==Legacy==
Poets and a number of composers and musicians left tributes in her honor. Gherardo Borgogni, a poet and literary editor, began writing verses honouring Andreini at the start of her literary career, and the two of them would end up exchanging verses for nearly twenty years. These verses for Andreini became the source of lyrics for future musical tributes. The earliest known musical tribute for Andreini was composed by Leone Leoni, and he used the Borgogni verses titled &quot;Tu pur ti parti&quot;, &quot;o Filli&quot;, and &quot;Dimmi Filli gradita&quot;. Other notable composers include Serafino Cantone, who was a Benedictine monk, and Peter Philips, who was an English composer. Andreini inspired many French poets, notably Isaac du Ryer (d. c. 1631).

Andreini was known and infamous because of her intimacy onstage. She connected with people and used complex characteristics to make her characters realistic and relatable.

Andreini and Inglis (a well-known French actress at the time) demonstrate that early modern women who were neither aristocratic or particularly wealthy could labour and think transnationally and be appreciated for it. Both travelled widely and on a regular basis, though Andreini&#x27;s theatrical job allowed her to do so more frequently. Both became well known among Europe&#x27;s cultural elite.

The &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; &quot;lover&quot; stock character, Isabella, was named from Andreini&#x27;s most famous character and used by subsequent &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; troupes. In particular, this school of theater has studied the posthumous works of Andreini, &quot;Rime, Parte seconda&quot; and &quot;Fragmenti de alcune scritture&quot;.

Many women in early &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; troupes are credited with advancing much of the improvisational tools used by the art form; Andreini is included in this legacy as a performer in the Gelosi troupe.

<text>Giambattista Andreini (9 February 1576 – 7 June 1654) was an Italian actor and the most important Italian playwright of the 17th century.

==Life==

Born in Florence to stage stars Isabella Andreini and Francesco Andreini, he had a great success as a comedian in Paris under the name of Leylio. He was a favourite with Louis XIII, and also with the public, especially as the young lover.

His wife Virginia Ramponi-Andreini, whom he married in 1601, was also a celebrated actress and singer.

==Works==

He left a number of plays full of extravagant imagination. The best known are &quot;L&#x27;Adamo&quot; (Milan, 1613),&quot; The Penitent Magdalene&quot; (Mantua, 1617), and &quot;The Centaur&quot; (Paris, 1622). From the first of these three volumes, which are extremely rare, Italians have often asserted that Milton, travelling at that time in their country, took the idea of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

<text>Sport Canada is a branch of the Department of Canadian Heritage that develops federal sport policy in Canada, provides funding programs in support of sport, and administers special projects related to sport. Its mission &quot;to enhance opportunities for all Canadians to participate and excel in sport.&quot;

The Government of Canada, through Sport Canada, provides financial support through 3 programs: Athlete Assistance Program, which gives direct financial support to selected national team athletes (CA$33 million/year); the Sport Support Program, which funds Canadian sports organizations (about $178.8 million/year); and the Hosting Program, which helps sport organizations to host the Canada Games and international sport events (about $21.6 million/year). Sport Canada special projects include research projects; projects aimed at increasing participation in sport; the Long-Term Athlete Development Model; and Podium Canada, consisting of the Own the Podium and Road to Excellence programs, aimed at improving Canada&#x27;s performance at the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

== History ==
In 1961, the &quot;Fitness and Amateur Sport Act&quot; came into force, whereby the Government of Canada made an official commitment to “encourage, promote and develop fitness and amateur sport in Canada.” Under this act, the now-defunct Department of National Health and Welfare, through its new Fitness and Amateur Sport Program, was responsible for making grants to any organization that carried out activities in the field of fitness or amateur sport. A few years later, the Canadian government created two new directorates: Recreation Canada, which was tasked with improving the lifestyle of Canadians, and Sport Canada, which was responsible for developing competitive sport.

The Dubin inquiry proved to be a seminal event in Sport Canada&#x27;s history, in the wake of the Ben Johnson doping scandal and national embarrassment.

Jean Charest was Minister of Fitness and Amateur Sport for a time during the Mulroney government, and he intended with his 1989 &quot;Towards the Year 2000&quot; policy statement &quot;to elevate Canada to one of the top three positions in the world in the area of sport.&quot;

Sport Canada controlled in 1991 sixty-five &quot;national sport organizations&quot; (NSOs), as the &quot;pivotal agency in each category of sport in Canada&quot;. These NSOs were &quot;incorporated non-profit agencies recognized by the federal government and eligible for federal financing through the Fitness and Amateur Sport Directorate.&quot;

In the early 1990s, the role of the Fitness and Amateur Sport Program was split between the Department of Canadian Heritage, which would be responsible for Sport Canada from then onward, and the Department of Health. The Department of Canadian Heritage was initially created by Prime Minister Kim Campbell from parts of several other federal departments, combining amateur sport with a number of other departments.

Sport Canada has since remained under the auspices of Canadian Heritage, while Health Canada continues its mandate of &quot;encourag[ing] Canadians to take an active role in their health, such as increasing their level of physical activity and eating well.&quot;

For much of its existence, responsibility for Sport Canada was given to a junior Cabinet Minister reporting to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. In 2015 with the advent of the government of Justin Trudeau, Sport Canada became the responsibility of the Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, a full Cabinet position that would eventually cease to be filled as of 2019.

==Funding==
The Government of Canada is involved in sport primarily through programs and policies administered by the Department of Canadian Heritage. Pursuant to section 4(2)(f) of the &quot;Department of Canadian Heritage Act&quot;, the department is tasked with &quot;the encouragement, promotion and development of sport.&quot;

There are three major sport funding programs that are run by Sport Canada which &quot;provide financial assistance to our high-performance athletes, advance the objectives of the Canadian Sport Policy, and help Canadian organizations host sport events that create opportunities for Canadians to compete at the national and international level.&quot;

* Athlete Assistance Program (AAP) — The AAP has a goal of providing funds to athletes throughout their training and preparations before and during National and International Games. Funding provided by the APP can be granted to Canadian athletes who meet the proper eligibility requirements. It is recommended for athletes who request the assistance of the AAP to live and train within the country, however, as long as the request is justified by the National Sport Organization, an exception may be granted for certain Canadian athletes to receive funding from the AAP.
* Sport Support Program (SSP) — distributes funding to national sport organizations (NSOs), national multisport service organizations (MSOs), Canadian sport centres, and other non-governmental organizations that provide direct services and programs for athletes, coaches, and other sport participants. Funding is provided to eligible organizations for programming that is aligned with the goals of the Canadian Sport Policy.
* Hosting Program — supports the hosting and organization of national and international sporting events in Canada, enhancing &quot;the international profile&quot; of Canadian sport organizations as well as delivering &quot;economic, social and cultural benefits to Canadian communities.&quot; This program is distributed through four sectors: International Major Multisport Games (Summer and Winter Olympic &amp; Paralympic Games; Commonwealth Games, and Pan and Parapan American Games, etc.); International Single Sport Events; International Multisport Games for Aboriginal Peoples and Persons with a Disability; and Canada Games, which are the largest Canadian games.

==Sport organizations==

The Government of Canada, through Sport Canada, invests funds and hard work into national level athletes and sporting events through the Sport Support Program (SSP). In order to provide &quot;a role in supporting amateur sport or in promoting an active and healthy lifestyle for Canadians,&quot; Sport Canada provides help to three major types of sport organizations: National Sport Organizations (NSOs), National Multisport Service Organizations (MSOs), and Canadian Sport Centres and Institutes.

=== National Sport Organizations ===
National Sport Organizations (NSOs), or National Sport Federations (NSFs), are governing bodies that represent a specific national sport in Canada. Each NSO has a duty to oversee all that impacts its national sport, it selects and manages the yearly team roster and provides &quot;professional development for coaches and officials in their sport.&quot; There are currently 58 NSOs in Canada.
=== National Multisport Service Organizations ===
National Multisport Service Organizations (MSOs) are organizations that focus on coordination, executing and conveying amenities to the sport community in Canada. These MSOs provide learning opportunities for Canadian coaches, and &quot;support for Aboriginal peoples in sport and national coordination for the North American Indigenous Games (NAIG),&quot; as well as focusing on promotion to increase Canadian participation in sport, among other things. There are currently 24 MSOs that are granted funding from Sport Canada to date.
=== Canadian Sport Institutes and Centres ===
Canadian Sport Institutes and Centres were developed in partnership between Sport Canada, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), the Coaching Association of Canada (CAC), and the provincial governments. The Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Sport Institute (COPSI) Network is a group of designated multisport training centres established in Canada recognized by Sport Canada and Own the Podium, and supported by national and provincial partners in partnership with 7 different provinces or regions across Canada.

There are 4 Canadian Sport Institutes (located in Calgary, Quebec, Ontario, and the Pacific Region), and 3 Canadian Sport Centres (located in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Atlantic Canada). These organizations not only provide training facilities for Canadian athletes but also promote innovation, sport science, sport medicine and coaching within Canada.

The COPSI Network &quot;supports the development of high performance sport in Canada through a network of training environments as well as through collaboration with National Sport Organization, national partners, provincial and local governments as well as the private sector to provide more opportunities for high performance athletes and coaches.&quot;
== Notable people ==
* Earl Dawson, regional director of Sport Canada and secretary of the Canada Games council (1971–1987) 
* Lou Lefaive, national director of Sport Canada (1971–1974, 1978–1980)

<doc id="1171192" wikidata="Q7305489" url="?curid=1171192" title="Redbox">
<text>Redbox Automated Retail, LLC was an American video rental and streaming media company, based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois west of Chicago. Redbox specialized in automated DVD rental kiosks, and operated transactional and ad-supported streaming video and television services. From 2022 until its liquidation, Redbox was a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment.

Redbox kiosks, which rented and sold films on DVD and Blu-Ray, were located at retail stores, including convenience stores, supermarkets, and pharmacies. At its peak in the early 2010s, the company operated kiosks at more than 34,000 locations, and controlled more than half of the US DVD rental market.

In June 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; the following month, the company’s case was converted to Chapter 7 liquidation. As part of ongoing liquidation proceedings, Redbox’s online streaming services and mobile app ceased functioning in July 2024.
==History==

===Founding under McDonald&#x27;s===
Redbox Automated Retail LLC was initially developed in Chicago as a part of “Project 361”, a McDonald&#x27;s business expansion initiative. John Sexton Abrams, a strategy executive at McDonald&#x27;s, designed the original concept as an immersive kiosk leveraging McDonald&#x27;s product supply chain and geographic footprint to provide 24/7 access to fresh dairy and other products. Initially, the kiosks sold a range of goods under the name TikTok Easyshops. In late 2003 McDonald&#x27;s ended its use of the kiosks for the products. Instead, McDonald&#x27;s executive Gregg Kaplan decided to use the kiosks for DVD rentals, which was tested in Denver in 2004. 

The company employed a &quot;return anywhere&quot; policy, different from competitors, which allowed consumers to return their rental to any Redbox kiosk, not just the one from which they originally rented it.

===Purchase by Coinstar===
In 2005, Coinstar bought 47% of the company for $32 million, after unsuccessful attempts to sell half the company to Blockbuster and Netflix. In early 2008, Coinstar exercised an option to increase its share to 51%, before acquiring the remainder for $169–176 million in February 2009. While traditional brick and mortar rental stores were closing at a high rate, Redbox moved into existing retail locations such as supermarkets, and placed kiosks within them or outside of them to gain access to that consumer base.

Competitors included Netflix, Blockbuster, Movie Gallery and its subsidiary Hollywood Video, West Coast Video, and Family Video along with other DVD by mail rental services. Mitch Lowe joined Redbox in 2003 after spending five years as an executive at Netflix. At Redbox, he started first as a consultant and then as VP of Purchasing &amp; Operations. In 2005, he became the Chief Operating Officer. Lowe owned and operated a video rental company named Video Droid from 1982 through 1997. Video Droid attempted a VHS rental vending machine concept, though the idea was quickly deemed impractical. Lowe was named President of Redbox in April 2009.

With growing concern in 2009 that DVD kiosks might jeopardize movie studio income from DVD sales and rentals, three major movie studios, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Studios, each refused to sell DVDs to Redbox until at least 28 days after their arrival in stores. Fox and Warner Bros. represented 62% of home video rental revenue in 2008–09. Redbox responded by filing lawsuits, first, against Universal in October 2008, then against 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. in August 2009. In August 2009, the federal judge hearing the Universal case allowed the antitrust claim to continue. In October 2009, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. filed motions to dismiss Redbox&#x27;s lawsuits against them. During that time, Redbox continued to rent films from the companies, purchasing them at retail from places like Walmart instead of receiving them from the movie studios, which in some cases saved Redbox money due to the discounted prices offered by retailers. Other major studios—Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and Lionsgate—signed distribution deals with Redbox. The Walt Disney Company permits third-party distributors to sell to Redbox, but has not entered into a direct relationship with the company. Both sides of the studio lawsuits pointed to these revenue-sharing deals to shore up their argument, with Redbox president Mitch Lowe saying, &quot;our growth can lead to theirs [the studios&#x27; growth]. For example, Redbox currently estimates we will pay more than a combined $1 billion over the next five years to Sony, Lionsgate and Paramount to purchase and then rent new-release DVDs to consumers,&quot; while Warner Bros. says the deals are proof that far from being shut out by Hollywood, &quot;Redbox&#x27;s business has thrived since its suit against Universal, underscored by lucrative distribution deals with Paramount Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and Lionsgate.&quot; Redbox entered into an agreement with Warner Bros. on February 16, 2010, followed by Universal and Fox on April 22, 2010. 

In the agreements which settle the lawsuits, Redbox agreed to not make available for rental films from these studios until 28 days after their initial home-video releases. Redbox continued to sign additional and new distribution deals with these and other movie studios; by 2017, titles from Fox and Warner became available on Redbox seven days after their initial home-video release.

=== Expansion and new products ===
With over 6,000 kiosks, Redbox surpassed Blockbuster as the largest U.S. video rental chain in November 2007. The company reached 100 million rentals in February 2008, and passed 1 billion rentals in September 2010. As of Q2 2011, 68% of the U.S. population lived within a five-minute drive of a Redbox kiosk. In Q2 2011, kiosks accounted for 36% of the disc rental market, with 38% of that attributable to rent-by-mail services and 25% to traditional stores, according to the NPD Group.

Redbox announced in July 2010 that they would introduce Blu-ray movies at 13,000 kiosks; by that fall, Blu-ray discs were available across the Redbox network. In October 2010, the company began offering video game rentals in select markets, including Reno, Nevada; Orlando, Florida; Stevens Point, Wisconsin; Austin, Texas; Wilmington, North Carolina; and Corvallis, Oregon. Video games were available at all Redbox locations by June 2011. In February 2012, Redbox announced the acquisition of Blockbuster Express, a competing kiosk-based rental service operated by NCR in partnership with Blockbuster. The $100 million purchase, completed on June 27, 2012, included over 10,000 kiosks, inventory, and certain retailer contracts. As part of the agreement, Redbox entered a supplier arrangement of purchasing product and services from NCR. The company sold some Blockbuster Express kiosks in less competitive markets to third party providers in June 2013. Also in 2012, Redbox partnered with New Era Tickets and Sparkart to test sales of live event tickets at Redbox kiosks. Redbox Tickets launched in October 2012 in Greater Philadelphia, and later expanded to the Los Angeles area in early 2013.

Redbox announced its 3 billionth disc rental, including both movies and games, in July 2013. The number of items rented from kiosks annually peaked in 2013, with 772.87 million rentals creating $1.97 billion in revenue; that year, Redbox rentals comprised more than 50% of DVD rentals in the United States with 717.13 million units rented in 2014, and 587.55 million in 2015. This decline was widely attributed to consumers&#x27; preferences shifting from physical media to online streaming; although as of 2014, Redbox still represented half of the physical media rental market.

==== Expansion into Canada ====
Redbox began offering rentals in Canada in mid-2012. 1,400 kiosks were installed in Canada before Redbox ended operations in the country in March 2015, citing low demand. These kiosks were subsequently relocated to retail stores in the United States.

=== Purchase by Apollo and IPO ===
In August 2012, Redbox&#x27;s founder, Gregg Kaplan, exited as president and COO of Redbox, and was succeeded as president by Anne Saunders. Throughout most of 2016, parent company Outerwall was seeking a buyer based on shareholder input. In early September, Outerwall was sold to Apollo Global Management and its three units (Coinstar, ecoATM and Redbox) were split into separate operating companies. In late September 2016, Outerwall CFO Galen Smith was announced as the new CEO of Redbox.

In January 2017, Redbox began moving some of its then-40,000 kiosks, with the intention of analyzing consumer trends and reacting to under-performing neighborhoods. On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a new video streaming service called Redbox On Demand. The percentage of consumers renting or purchasing movies from Redbox rose in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter, according to a TiVo survey. That month, Disney sued Redbox, accusing them of violating copyrights by selling codes to download Disney movies such as &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

In April 2018, Redbox acquired the independent film &quot;Benjamin&quot; for a 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service, as the first Redbox Original. In October 2019 Redbox formed a film and TV series production division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition. Redbox announced on December 9, 2019, that it would no longer be renting video games but will continue selling used video game copies through the end of the year.

Redbox Free Live TV, a free ad-supported streaming television service, was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18. The company&#x27;s revenue fell 20% in 2019, 36% in 2020 and over 50% in 2021. On May 17, 2021, Redbox announced that it reached a definitive agreement to merge with Seaport Global Acquisition, a special-purpose acquisition company which would result in Redbox being publicly listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker RDBX. The company officially went public on October 25, 2021.

===Acquisition by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, bankruptcy and liquidation===
On May 11, 2022, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment announced its intention to acquire Redbox for $375 million. The acquisition was completed on August 11, 2022, less than a year after Redbox went public. At the end of 2022, the company operated about 34,000 kiosks nationwide, with plans to increase that number with 1,000 more kiosks in 2023. In July 2023, CSSE announced a partnership with the video sharing platform TikTok, under which screens showcasing top content from the service will be installed on at least 3,000 Redbox kiosks. These ads will also display advertising sold by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment&#x27;s sales platform Crackle Connex.

In August 2023, convenience store chain 7-Eleven terminated its contract with Redbox due to its failure to pay commissions and demanded the kiosks be removed; Redbox failed to do so. Franchisees began to unplug machines and tape credit card readers shut. 7-Eleven eventually filed a lawsuit in June 2024. In February 2024, drug store chain CVS filed a lawsuit against Redbox for failure to pay commissions during the third quarter of 2022. Convenience store chain Sheetz followed suit the same month for not receiving payments since the end of 2022.
On April 23, 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment announced a $636.6 million loss in 2023, and warned that without any options to generate additional financing, the company could be forced to liquidate or pause operations, and seek a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing. However, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment did also report that Redbox&#x27;s sales increased last year, seeing a 66% increase in annual revenue to $112.7 million.

By June 15, all Redbox kiosks in Hannaford grocery stores had been shut down. On June 29, 2024, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after missing a week of paying its employees and failing to secure financing. On July 10, 2024, a bankruptcy judge ordered to convert Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation after accusing the company&#x27;s previous CEO of misusing the business and failing to pay employees or support healthcare. With the Chapter 7 conversion, the company&#x27;s assets will be liquidated, resulting in the shut down of its subsidiaries, including Redbox. In addition, over 1,000 employees will be laid off. The company&#x27;s website and apps were taken down shortly after.

Although many of Redbox’s kiosks have been removed, many remaining kiosks are still functional and dispense discs. Some kiosks have been taken by hobbyists and tinkerers who aim to reverse engineer the software used by them. A major company involved in the removal and disposal of Redbox kiosks is The Junkluggers, although most kiosks are removed by independent contractors. The Junkluggers aim to recycle the metal used by the kiosks and donate the DVDs inside to community organizations. 

== Rental kiosks ==

Redbox&#x27;s vending kiosks rent and sell movies on DVD and Blu-Ray discs. Each stocked a selection of roughly 200 titles, with multiple copies of popular titles. 
Many Redbox kiosks were installed indoors, while others are located outdoors. They were usually attached to a large sign advertising a selection of featured films, and some locations feature two attached kiosks, allowing for additional selection and stock. Each kiosk was operated by customers via a touchscreen, and contained a robotic disc retrieval system with a stacked carousel capable of holding more than 600 discs. Discs within are marked with barcodes, allowing identification by the kiosk&#x27;s machinery, and stored on the carousel in thin plastic cases, which are dispensed to customers via a small slot next to the control panel. 

Rented discs could be returned to any of the company&#x27;s kiosks. Charges accrued up to 25 days, after which the customer then owned the DVD (without the original case) and rental charges ceased. Customers could reserve DVDs online, made possible by real-time inventory updates on the company&#x27;s website. While customers could buy used DVDs from the kiosks (with unsold used DVDs returned to suppliers), Redbox estimated only 3% of the company&#x27;s revenue came from used-disc sales.

At its peak, a Redbox kiosk rented its average DVD 15 times at an average of $2 per transaction plus any applicable taxes.

From 2010 to 2019, Redbox kiosks rented video games. Initially games for the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 were offered; titles for the Wii U, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One were added in 2014, followed by Nintendo Switch games upon that console&#x27;s launch in 2017.

=== Equipment history ===
Redbox began in 2004, using re-branded kiosks manufactured and operated by Silicon Valley–based DVDPlay, at 140 McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Denver and other test markets. In April 2005, Redbox phased out the DVDPlay-manufactured machines and contracted the Solectron facility in Creedmoor, North Carolina—later purchased by Flextronics International, in October 2007 (Flextronics has been the manufacturer of the Zune, Xbox and Xbox 360)—to create and manufacture a custom kiosk design. The new kiosk was designed by Flextronics&#x27; Creedmoor design team including engineers Steven Hancock and John Rupert as key contributors under the direction of Franz Kuehnrich at GetAMovie Inc. (which was bought by RedBox). Other key contributors from Flextronics were Flextronics Global account manager Dave Stadelmaier and Global Supply Chain manager Ben Wheeler (The KioskGuy). Redbox was innovative in that its carousel design not only decreased the number of robotic movements necessary to dispense and restock inventory, it also dramatically increased the number of discs (from 100 to 700+) which could be stored within a kiosk. In addition, the software, designed and developed by Enterprise Logic Systems, was also innovative in that it allowed RedBox to remotely monitor and manage inventory at all kiosks throughout the country.

===Redbox+===
In late December 2020, Redbox began offering a yearly subscription service allowing a subscriber to rent 12 or 24 discs in total, depending on their plan of choice. Only eligible movies could be rented on the plans. It extended the user return window until midnight, giving customers an additional 3 hours to return a movie to a kiosk.
=== Major host chains ===
Retail chains hosting Redbox kiosks have included McDonald&#x27;s, CVS, Walgreens, Dollar General, Family Dollar, Walmart, Market Basket in New England, Kroger in addition to subsidiaries in Albertsons, Safeway, Meijer, Winn-Dixie, Publix, Hannaford in New York and New England, Wegmans, 7-Eleven, Cumberland Farms, Circle K, and Sheetz.

Redbox began internally testing a video streaming service, dubbed Redbox Instant, in July 2012. The service was a joint effort between Redbox and Verizon. On March 14, 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon officially went public, offering customers a free 1-month trial of an $8/month unlimited streaming service that includes 4 disc rentals from kiosks ($1 more for Blu-ray). The service launched with 4,600 titles from movie companies including Epix, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures, Relativity, and Sony Pictures. According to early reports, Redbox Instant planned to allow users to download content to mobile devices for offline viewing; titles could be either rented or purchased, in SD or HD quality, with rental customers having 30 days to begin viewing their title and 48 hours of unlimited views thereafter.

In June 2013, Sony made the official announcement at E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) that Redbox Instant would be available on the PlayStation 4 console, and it was released in late 2013. Android and iOS apps also enabled streaming content on mobile devices.

Redbox Instant disabled sign-ups for new users in mid 2014 owing to a growing number of people using the website to verify stolen credit cards. In Q2 2014 earning call, Outerwall, Redbox&#x27;s parent company, stated that they were &quot;not pleased&quot; with Redbox Instant subscription numbers. Finally on October 4, 2014, it was announced that Redbox Instant would shut down on October 7, only 19 months after its initial launch.

===Redbox On Demand===
On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a new service called Redbox On Demand. Like Redbox Instant, it is a streaming service, but based on a different model. It does not require any membership, and the list will contain new releases as well as several titles that it is claimed will never be available on services like Netflix. The service launched with 6,000 titles for on demand rental or electronic sell-through in line with its kiosk operations. The titles come from the major film studios&#x27; libraries except for Disney and Lionsgate.

===Redbox Free Live TV===
Redbox Free Live TV was an ad supported channel based video on demand service. The service was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18. Nearly 30 channels were offered—three self-branded channels: Redbox Rush (action and adventure), Redbox Comedy and Redbox Spotlight, featured and recommended titles. The service&#x27;s launch content partner was Lionsgate. Other content suppliers include &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, Cinedigm, Comedy Dynamics, Fremantle, FilmRise, Gravitas, Jukin Media, Kabillion, Maverick Movies, People Are Awesome, TMZ, and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

==Redbox Entertainment==
Redbox Entertainment was Redbox’s content acquisition and production division.

On April 23, 2019, Redbox acquired the indie film &quot;Benjamin&quot; for an exclusive 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service as a Redbox Original. In October 2019, Redbox formed its film and TV series acquisition division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition. Then Redbox Entertainment exclusively picked up the distribution rights to &quot;Assailant&quot;, which was released in March 2022, and &quot;Vendetta&quot;, which was released in May 2022.

<doc id="1171193" wikidata="Q529610" url="?curid=1171193" title="Luis Somoza Debayle">
<text>Luis Anastasio Somoza Debayle (18 November 1922 – 13 April 1967) was the 50th President of Nicaragua from 1957 until his resignation in 1963. He succeeded to the presidency following the death of his father, Anastasio Somoza García. The Somoza family was the most powerful family in the country at that time.

Somoza Debayle was born in León on 18 November 1922. In 1936 at the age of 14, he and his younger brother Anastasio attended Saint Leo College Prep near Tampa, before transferring to La Salle Military Academy on Long Island. Luis was then educated at Louisiana State University, where he was a member of Fi Sigma Alfa Hispanic fraternity. He married Costa Rican Isabel Urcuyo on 9 June 1947, and they had seven children together.

Following the assassination of his father, Anastasio Somoza García, Luis was tapped as acting president, and was elected president in his own right the following year. His rule was somewhat milder than that of his father. However, civil liberties remained restricted, and corruption remained widespread.

His brother, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, headed the National Guard and was the second most powerful man in the country during his older brother&#x27;s rule. Although Luis declined to run for reelection in 1963, he and Anastasio saw to it that the presidency was held from 1963 onward by politicians loyal to the Somozas. As a result, Luis remained the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Nicaragua until his death in 1967, when he suffered a massive heart attack in Managua at the age of 44.

Luis Somoza was the president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua from 1950 to 1953, and 1954 to 1956, and the president of the Senate from 1965 to 1966.

Under Luis Somoza&#x27;s regime, Nicaragua played a key role leading to the creation of the Central American Common Market, with the Alliance for Progress backing that common market&#x27;s creation. During the Bay of Pigs Invasion, he allowed the CIA-trained Cuban rebels to embark from Puerto Cabezas, on Nicaragua&#x27;s Caribbean coast. The Sandinistas began their struggle against the government in 1961 – a struggle that would oust his brother in 1979.

==Death==

He died at home on April 13, 1967, due to a heart attack. That place is now the Ministry of Defense. He is entombed at Cementerio Occidental with his father, in the National Guard Mausoleum in Managua, Nicaragua. His wife Isabel moved to Houston, Texas in the early 1990s, and died there in 2014.

<text>Rhys Llywelyn Isaac (20 November 1937 – 6 October 2010) was a South African-born Australian historian of American history who also worked in the United States.

Isaac and his twin brother Glynn were born in Cape Town, South Africa, to William Edwyn Isaac and Frances Margaret Leighton, both professional botanists.

Isaac earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Cape Town. In 1959 he was the Cape Province Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College (Oxford), earning his Ph.D. in 1962.

In 1963 Isaac emigrated to Australia, where he taught at the University of Melbourne, and later at La Trobe University (1971–91), where he was emeritus professor of American history. In 1975 he was a distinguished visiting professor of early American history at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.

Isaac won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for History for his book &quot;The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790&quot; (1982), becoming the first and only Australian historian to win a Pulitzer Prize.

In 2004 Isaac published &quot;Landon Carter&#x27;s Uneasy Kingdom: Revolution and Rebellion on a Virginia Plantation&quot;, which made use of the exemplary diary of a Virginian landholder and member of the House of Burgesses.

==Death==
Isaac died at his home in Blairgowrie, Victoria, Australia, on 6 October 2010, aged 72, from cancer.

<text>David Joseph Manners (born Rauff de Ryther Duan Acklom; April 30, 1900 – December 23, 1998) was a Canadian-American actor who played John Harker in Tod Browning&#x27;s 1931 horror classic &quot;Dracula&quot;, which starred Bela Lugosi in the title role. The following year, Manners portrayed the archaeologist Frank Whemple in &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), another pre-Code thriller by Universal Pictures.

==Early life==
David Joseph Manners (originally Rauff De Ryther Duan Acklom) was born in Canada at 108 Tower Road in Halifax, Nova Scotia on April 30, 1900. He was the younger child and only son of British parents, writer George Moreby Acklom and Lilian (or Lillian) Manners, as well as being the nephew of Cecil Ryther Acklom, a senior officer in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. He had an elder sister, Dorothea Cecily Acklom (later Mrs. Hall; 1898–1972). His father, in Halifax, was then the headmaster of Harrow House School, a prestigious private boarding school for boys. Eight years later, in 1907, Rauff, his mother, and his older sister left Canada and emigrated to the United States to join his father, who had emigrated during the previous year and secured a job as a literary advisor for E.P. Dutton, a publishing company in New York. By 1910 the entire Acklom family was living at 108 Hillside Avenue in Mount Vernon, New York, a northern suburb of New York City.

The Ackloms by January 1920 had relocated again, then to West 123rd Street in Manhattan, where 19-year-old Manners (still Rauff) continued to reside with his parents. He was employed as an assistant publisher and seemed destined to repeat his father&#x27;s own career choice and live out his life as an editor and publisher. Soon, perhaps in an effort to chart an entirely different course for himself professionally, Manners stopped working as an assistant publisher and returned to Canada to study forestry at the University of Toronto. He found the curriculum there boring; however, he was attracted to stage work on campus. After receiving some drama training, he made his acting debut in 1924 at the school&#x27;s Hart House Theater in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hippolytus&quot;.

Despite his father&#x27;s objections, Manners continued to pursue an entertainment career when he came back to the United States. Before long he was performing in theaters in Chicago, on Broadway, and elsewhere after joining Basil Sydney&#x27;s Touring Company and later Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory Company in New York. During his time, before he moved to Hollywood at the beginning of the sound era in films, he obtained additional training under Le Gallienne, even though she had remarked that he was &quot;a very bad actor&quot; after seeing one of his performances. Manners in this period also appeared on the New York stage with Helen Hayes, with whom he co-starred in Edgar Selwyn and Edmund Goulding&#x27;s play &quot;Dancing Mothers&quot; at the Booth Theatre.

==Hollywood career==
After arriving in California, around 1927, Manners was serendipitously &quot;discovered&quot; by the movie director James Whale at a Hollywood party, and within a few years he was a popular leading man, playing opposite such actresses as Katharine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck, Gloria Stuart, Myrna Loy, Loretta Young, and Ann Dvorak. He was paired several times with Helen Chandler. After performing in an uncredited role in &quot;The Sky Hawk&quot; in 1929, he was featured the next year in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. Reviewers of the latter film, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;, officially bestowed their endorsements on the fledgling movie actor&#x27;s work. His subsequent performances were critically praised again in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and by other influential film critics.

In late 1930 Manners filmed his best remembered role, as Jonathan Harker opposite Bela Lugosi, in Universal&#x27;s horror classic &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931). Until the end of his life, he continued to receive mail from fans of the movie, although he claimed to have never seen the finished film. In his tenth movie, he co-starred with Barbara Stanwyck in Frank Capra&#x27;s critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful &quot;The Miracle Woman&quot; (1931). &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Manners again for his portrayal of a blind war veteran, stating that &quot;Manners does exceptionally well with this sympathetic assignment&quot;.

During his brief tenure with Warner Bros., which had loaned him to other studios quite frequently, Manners progressed from being a supporting player to achieving true movie-star status following his role in &quot;Crooner&quot; in 1932. Shortly after that production&#x27;s release, he began to freelance with much success. One of the final films he made before the end of his Warner Bros.&#x27; contract was RKO&#x27;s &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot;, starring John Barrymore, Katharine Hepburn and Billie Burke. 

After the success of &quot;Dracula&quot;, Manners worked for several years as a romantic leading man, and was most often seen in a tuxedo in romantic comedies and light dramas. &quot;The Last Flight&quot; (1931), a Lost Generation celebration of the high life in Paris, and Karl Freund&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) with Boris Karloff were two standouts. But by 1936 he had grown bored with Hollywood, and abandoned his film career. He reportedly never acclimated to Hollywood, which he found to be &quot;a false place&quot;. Although he was among the first group of actors to join the fledgling Screen Actors Guild in 1933, he returned to New York City, but he moved back to California three years later. Manners grew increasingly frustrated with his roles in Hollywood and with his film career in general, despite all its successes. Following his work on three films released in 1936—&quot;Hearts in Bondage&quot;, &quot;A Woman Rebels&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Fugitives&quot;—he left the studios and retired from film work. He did, however, continue to perform regularly on stage for another 17 years, appearing in various productions on tour, in summer stock, and on Broadway, including the ill-fated 1946 play &quot;Hidden Horizon&quot;. In 1953, Manners retired from acting entirely.

==Personal life and death==
Manners married only once. In New York City, on May 23, 1929, he married Suzanne Bushnell, a native of Springfield, Ohio. A year later, according to the 1930 United States census, he and his 23-year-old wife were living together in Los Angeles in a $175-a-month rental property, along with Antonio Dumles, a 22-year-old Filipino who was listed as the couple&#x27;s servant. David and Suzanne&#x27;s marriage proved to be a brief one; they divorced in 1932.

In 1940, he officially changed his name to David Joseph Manners (Manners being his mother&#x27;s maiden name), a change that is verified by its citation in the 1940 United States census. That same census also documents that he had applied to become a naturalised citizen of the United States. It further identifies Manners as an &quot;Author/Actor&quot; and that he was then living in Victorville, California, residing alone in a home, part of a ranch, that he had purchased several years earlier.

He became a published novelist in 1941 with &quot;Convenient Season&quot;; a second novel, &quot;Under Running Laughter&quot;, followed in 1943. (He used the name David J. Manners for his novels, both of which were published by E.P. Dutton.) 

Manners was gay. In 1948, he met playwright Frederic William Mercer and the two lived together as partners for 30 years until Mercer&#x27;s death in 1978. Initially, they lived together at Manners&#x27;s ranch but left Victorville in 1956 to move to another residence in Pacific Palisades.

Following his retirement from acting, Manners spent the remaining decades of his life pursuing his personal interests, including painting, writing and studying philosophy. His reflections on philosophy were presented in &quot;Look Through: An Evidence of Self Discovery&quot;, published in 1971 by El Cariso Publications.

In 1998, 20 years after William Mercer&#x27;s death, David Manners died at age 98 in the health centre of a retirement community in Santa Barbara, California. His body was cremated and the ashes were taken to San Bernardino County and scattered at Rancho Yucca Loma in Victor Valley.

<text>Paper Aeroplanes were a Welsh alternative pop band founded in 2009 (when they changed their name from Halflight) by Sarah Howells and Richard Llewellyn, although both members had played together in Halflight since 2003. The band built up a fanbase through gigging in Cardiff in their early years, before later touring UK-wide and across Europe.

After releasing four albums and going on several tours, including a sold-out show at London&#x27;s Union Chapel, the group announced their separation to focus on solo projects in 2017. Howells now tours as a solo artist under the stage name Bryde.

==History==
Guitarist Sarah Howells, from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, was a member of promising indie band Jylt which broke up when her friend and the band&#x27;s bassist Nia George was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2002. Following a period of reflection Sarah teamed up with fellow guitarist Richard Llewellyn, originally from Ceredigion, to form Halflight. The duo, who were compared to artists as diverse as Lisa Loeb and The Sundays, began building a fanbase by extensive gigging across South Wales and released three EPs on their own My First Record label between 2004 and 2007, each of which met with critical acclaim and garnered positive reviews. In 2008, at about the same time that they were recording their debut album, they announced that they intended changing their name, in order to avoid clashing with another band called Half Light.

The name chosen was Paper Aeroplanes and they have continued to make music that has been compared to Fleetwood Mac, Suzanne Vega, The Sundays, Marika Hackman and Laura Marling. The BBC described them as &quot;a west coast, easy-riding, folkish indie with a pop sensibility&quot;, 31 May 2010.

Their album &quot;The Day We Ran into the Sea&quot;, which was released in 2010 and included a number of songs performed live by Halflight, was described by the BBC&#x27;s Adam Walton as &quot;&#x27;pop&#x27; music: brilliantly crafted and stoked from a bruised heart&#x27;s embers&quot;. BBC Radio Wales described it as &quot;the finest radio album to come out of Wales since &quot;Rockferry&quot;&quot;.
Their 2011 album We Are Ghosts received a host of reviews and saw &quot;The Guardian&quot; describe them as &quot;disarming, breezy pop that&#x27;s tinged with melancholy&quot;. Paul Kerr, reviewing their 2011 EP &quot;A Comfortable Sleep&quot; for Fourohfive 405 said &quot;Paper Aeroplanes are an oasis of gravity in a cultural desert of frivolity, of emotion in a cold hearted world.&quot;

In 2012, the band performed at Hay Festival. August 2012 saw several songs soundtracking an episode of BBC3&#x27;s TV Series &quot;Lip Service&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Little Letters&quot;, was released on Navigator Records and saw the band reach number 28 in the UK Alternative Chart.

The band have played live on BBC Radio Wales several times and featured on Bob Harris&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show, being interviewed by Harris and performing a live session. They have also recorded a live video session for the BBC. BBC Radio Wales are big supporters of the band making them Artist of the Week several times, most recently in May 2015 with single, &quot;Good Love Lives On&quot;.

The band have toured the UK and Germany for several years building a live following. They sold out London&#x27;s Union Chapel in November 2014. They also played at The New Adelphi Club, Hull, East Yorkshire in January that year.

The album &quot;JOY&quot; was released on 8 April 2015, and saw tracks featured on BBC Radio&#x27;s 1 and 2 as well as a host of German stations such as NDR2 and Radio Eins.

In April 2015, Paper Aeroplanes played their debut SXSW show playing several shows most notably at British Music Embassy at Latitude 60.

In November 2017, the band announced on their official Facebook page that &quot;while they don&#x27;t want to say that Paper Aeroplanes has come to an end&quot;, they had no plans to record future music together, with Howells instead choosing to focus on her solo project Bryde.

He also held the all-time world record in the raw bench press, regardless of weight class with for 8 years.

He&#x27;s the only man in the world to hold both raw and equipped (multi-ply) world records, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest bench pressers of all-time.

His maternal grandfather Morris Reif, known as the &quot;Bronxville Bomber&quot; was Rocky Marciano&#x27;s stable mate and scored 75 knockouts in 115 fights. In his youth Mendelson loved sports and played baseball and American football. Starting strength training when he reached his teens, he moved into the sport of wrestling and boxing, where he first recognized his rapid growth in strength. Then he moved into bodybuilding. With his pure strength showing even more through his bodybuilding training, Mendelson decided to become a powerlifter.

==Powerlifting career==
Mendelson started as a raw benchpresser and in 2000, benched raw at APF California State &amp; LALC Invitational. He then moved into equipped division in multi-ply category and benched during the same year in APF Los Angeles Lifting Club competition.

<doc id="1171234" wikidata="Q7727916" url="?curid=1171234" title="The Coyote Kings of the Space-Age Bachelor Pad">
<text>The Coyote Kings of the Space-Age Bachelor Pad is a comic science fiction novel and social satire written by Canadian writer and activist Malcolm Azania under the pen name of &quot;Minister Faust&quot;. His first book, it received major international release in August 2004 by the publisher Random House.

Unconventionally, the novel is told from eleven points of view employing distinct first-person narrative voices. Set in Edmonton in 1995, it follows two main characters: Hamza, Sudanese-Canadian former honours English student working as a dishwasher, and Yehat, a Trinidadian-Canadian, a video store clerk and inventor. Hamza is also a Muslim, although his faith is somewhat in crisis. Stuck in a rut, their lives are going nowhere until a mysterious woman shows up, seduces Hamza and draws the two into a quest for a magic artifact.

The &quot;Coyote&quot; is a name that symbolizes an interesting story of his birth. The story that clarifies the name that he chose for himself was shared with the mysterious women. He faithfully believes in the way his name correlates to his character; the strength and the mysteriousness of a sneaky coyote. With good and evil fighting behind the scene known as, the Secret Society on a quest to capture the Secret artifact- the Canopic Jar. The Meanys are bad guys businessmen that create a special cream which resembles the look of crack cocaine and has the ingredients of human bones. Hazma and his Coyote Crew fight the Meanys to capture the great jar that holds ancient secrets of Egyptian knowledge and to unravel the truth. The quest to find the Canopic jar is action filled with an ending that has a twist.

&quot;Minister Faust brings their world alive in a jumpy, hold-nothing-back style,&quot; wrote Gerald Jonas in the New York Times Book Review. &quot;Faust anatomizes [the Edmonton setting] with the same loving care Joyce brought to early-20th-century Dublin... Faust&#x27;s debut novel is a fresh and stylish entertainment.&quot;

&quot;With an attention to detail and an eye for the absurd,&quot; wrote reviewer Rick Klaw in the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, &quot;it is as if Faust channeled Mark Twain to write a Neal Stephenson novel.&quot;

<doc id="1171241" wikidata="Q1806839" url="?curid=1171241" title="White Island (Otago)">
<text>White Island () is an island off the coast of Otago, within the boundaries of the city of Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand. It is uninhabited, and is a well-known landmark visible from the city&#x27;s two inner city beaches at St Clair and St Kilda. The island is in length and wide at its widest point, covering and rising to a height of approximately . A rocky reef, parts of which break the surface at low tide, extends for from the western end of the island.

== Name ==
The island&#x27;s te reo Māori name is Ponuiahine - also given as &#x27;Pomuiahine&#x27;. It has been translated, probably too literally, as &#x27;The girl&#x27;s great night&#x27;, giving rise to witty suggestions as to why that might be. Goodall and Griffiths suggested it should be understood as &#x27;Pou-nui-a-Hine, referring to a post being a memorial to some significant event involving Hine&#x27;. They observe &#x27;Hine&#x27; can be a man&#x27;s name but clearly this suggestion leaves open the original ribald speculations. As a place for a lovers&#x27; tryst it seems unpromising.

== Ragged Rock ==
White Island may be the &#x27;Ragged Rock&#x27; where the Sydney sealer &quot;Brothers&quot;, chartered by Robert Campbell and under the command of Robert Mason landed three men out of a gang of eleven in November 1809. William Tucker who later settled at Whareakeake (Murdering Beach), near Otago Heads, was in the gang. Alternatively Ragged Rock may be Green Island.

== 1826 sighting ==
On 1 May 1826 Thomas Shepherd, keeping a journal as he approached this coast as nurseryman to the first New Zealand Company&#x27;s settlement expedition in the &quot;Rosanna&quot;, accompanied by the &quot;Lambton&quot;, said he &#x27;saw two remarkable Sugar loaf Rocks in the sea near the shore about high&#x27;. A man was sent ashore and came back with a Māori man called Tatawa who &#x27;said he belonged to Otago&#x27;. Shepherd later confirmed this was the part of the coast he was talking about. There is a reef south of White Island where the sea may be seen breaking. Presumably in the 1820s it too rose well above the sea. By the time of Dunedin&#x27;s settlement in 1848 there was only the single island visible.

<doc id="1171256" wikidata="Q1157557" url="?curid=1171256" title="Daihatsu Compagno">
<text>The Daihatsu Compagno is an automobile which was produced by Daihatsu in Japan from 1963 to 1970. The name comes from the Italian word for &quot;partner.&quot; The Compagno was designed to be offered in multiple bodystyles, and was introduced prior to the acquisition of Daihatsu by Toyota in 1967. The Compagno was available as a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, two-door pickup truck, a three-door delivery van and a convertible. The first Compagno prototype was shown at the 1961 Tokyo Motor Show and was of an appearance reminiscent of the Fiat 1800/2100. This was not a very well balanced design and Vignale&#x27;s production version ended up looking quite different. The Compagno used a ladder-type chassis instead of the more modern monocoque style, with torsion bar wishbone suspension at the front and semi-elliptical leaf springs for the rear axle. The Compagno is also the first Daihatsu car to use the famous &quot;D&quot; logo.

==History==
One hundred twenty thousand Daihatsu Compagnos were produced between 1963 and 1970. The first model introduced, in April 1963, was the Compagno Light Van light commercial vehicle (F30V). It was available in Standard or Deluxe trim. Two months later the Compagno Wagon (F30) followed, a pricier and more comfortable and passenger oriented version. This cost over twenty per cent more than the Standard Light Van and was Daihatsu&#x27;s first four-wheeled passenger car. In November 1963 the Japanese-designed two-door saloon appeared, called &quot;Berlina&quot; and with the F30 chassis code. This was available in either Standard and Deluxe trim, priced close to their Light Van and Wagon counterparts. The Deluxe had an Italianate dashboard, reflecting Vignale&#x27;s input, complete with three-spoke Nardi steering wheel.

To celebrate the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Daihatsu used two Compagnos and a New line in a PR stunt, driving the from the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece to Tokyo in a little over three months.

In April 1965 the Compagno Spider appeared, introducing the larger and more powerful 1000 engine. The engine displacement was initially kept below one liter to price the car in the lowest road tax bracket for Japanese buyers. The Spider received a twin-carb unit producing . One month later the larger engine was also installed in the Berlina, and a new four-door model (only with the bigger engine) was added. The four-door model sits on a longer wheelbase. 1000 Berlinas have a single carburettor and produce . In October 1965 the F31P Compagno Truck appeared, a small pickup truck capable of loading . The 800 cc engine gradually became installed only in the lesser variants as the 1000 cc segment gained in popularity in Japan. In November the Compagno 1000 GT appeared, a Berlina two-door with the more powerful Spider engine. In April 1967 a two-speed automatic transmission became available.

In May 1967 the Compagno received a minor facelift, with new head- and taillights and a new grille. The fender pressings were also subtly altered so as to streamline production. A Super Deluxe version of the four-door was added, while the Spider and GT gained front disc brakes. Last amongst the news was the 1000 GT Injection, with mechanical fuel injection albeit no more power than the existing twin-carb version. In April 1968 the front grille was altered again, with black trim for the Spider and GT. The Super Deluxe gained chrome trim at the rear. In April 1969 the succeeding Daihatsu Consorte appeared, using Daihatsu&#x27;s own 1.0-litre engine fitted in the Toyota Publica KP30 body. Daihatsu decided to depend on Toyota for designing compact cars from now on. The Consorte was initially only available as a two-door sedan, and while the Van, Truck, and Convertibles were not replaced the four-door Super Deluxe remained in production until January 1970 so as to meet existing orders.

Notably, the Compagno was the first official Japanese car import for the UK market. Arriving in May 1965 in its initial 797cc form, UK press such as Autocar magazine found the car to be quite lackluster compared to its competition. Aside from the build quality and good standard equipment, the magazine review noted its outdated styling, poor ride and brakes, high price, and a 0-60 time that was quoted as being &quot;too slow to record.&quot; In the end, only six Compagnos would be sold in the UK in its five years on the market. Nonetheless, the Compagno would eventually inspire other Japanese automakers to begin exporting their products to European markets, such as the 1966 Corona from Toyota and the 1968 Sunny from Nissan (which would be known as the Datsun 1000).

The Compagno was also sold in numerous other European markets. In Australia it was marketed until import tariffs were changed in 1968, which would have made the car prohibitively expensive. Daihatsu returned to the Australian passenger car market in 1972 with the Max 360X.

==Models==
* 1963–1967 Compagno 800 Van (797 cc, ) three-door van; model F30V
* 1963–1967 Compagno 800 Berlina (797 cc, ) two-door sedan; model F30
* 1965–1970 Compagno 1000 Berlina (958 cc, ) two or four-door sedan; model F40 – later models have 58 PS
* 1965–1969 Compagno 1000 Truck (958 cc, ) two-door pickup truck; model F31P
* 1965–1969 Compagno Spider 1000 (958 cc, ) two-door convertible; model F40K

Maximum speed was around for the 800 cc model, for 1000 cc models. Late Spiders and GTs have a fuel injected engine.

== DN Compagno Concept ==
The DN Compagno is a concept car that was shown at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show along with the original Compagno. According to Daihatsu, the design was aimed at &quot;active seniors&quot; and prioritized the relaxing comfort of the two front seats, combined with a high-quality interior.

<doc id="1171266" wikidata="Q3960579" url="?curid=1171266" title="All caps">
<text>In typography, text or font in all caps (short for &quot;all capitals&quot;) contains capital letters without any lowercase letters. For example: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG. All-caps text can be seen in legal documents, advertisements, newspaper headlines, and the titles on book covers. Short strings of words in capital letters appear bolder and &quot;louder&quot; than mixed case, and this is sometimes referred to as &quot;screaming&quot; or &quot;shouting&quot;. All caps can also be used to indicate that a given word is an acronym.

Studies have been conducted on the readability and legibility of all caps text. Scientific testing from the 20th century onward has generally indicated that all caps text is less legible and readable than lower-case text. In addition, switching to all caps may make text appear hectoring and obnoxious for cultural reasons, since all-capitals is often used in transcribed speech to indicate that the speaker is shouting. All-caps text is common in comic books, as well as on older teleprinter and radio transmission systems, which often do not indicate letter case at all.

In professional documents, a commonly preferred alternative to all caps text is the use of small caps to emphasise key names or acronyms (for example, ), or the use of &quot;italics&quot; or (more rarely) [[All caps|bold]]. In addition, if all caps must be used it is customary to slightly widen the spacing between the letters, by around 10 per cent of the point height. This practice is known as tracking or letterspacing. Some digital fonts contain alternative spacing metrics for this purpose.

== Association with shouting or yelling ==
Messages completely in capital letters are often equated on social media to shouting and other impolite or argumentative behaviors. This became a mainstream interpretation with the advent of networked computers, from the 1980s onward. However, a similar interpretation was already evidenced by written sources that predated the computing era, in some cases by at least a century, and the textual display of shouting or emphasis was still not a settled matter by 1984. The following sources may be relevant to the history of all caps:
:* The 17 April 1856 edition of the &quot;Yorkville Enquirer&quot; (South Carolina) uses the expression &quot;This time he shouted it out in capital letters.&quot; 
:* The 1880 book &quot;The Standard speaker and elocutionist&quot; has a section titled &quot;SHOUTING STYLE&quot;, which states that &quot;This will be seldom needed throughout an entire piece, but wherever the words imply calling, or commanding, it will be in keeping with the words to employ it. As examples note the following selections marked in CAPITAL letters as the appropriate place for shouting emphasis.&quot; A large number of literature examples are then given where all caps has been used to represent shouting. 
:* The 6 September 1958 edition of &quot;Bookseller: The Organ of the Book Trade&quot; describes writing in lower-case &quot;rather than shouting with all caps. The effect is pleasing to anybody in a contemplative mood.&quot;
:* A 2014 article on netiquette (online etiquette) in &quot;New Republic&quot;, titled &quot;How Capital Letters Became Internet Code for Yelling&quot;, states that: 
::* According to Professor Paul Luna (of the University of Reading&#x27;s department of typography and graphic communication), all caps has been used &quot;to convey grandeur, pomposity, or aesthetic seriousness for thousands of years&quot;, and for many years to express anger or shouting in print. Examples are cited such as pianist Philippa Schuyler&#x27;s 1940s biography titled &quot;Composition in Black and White&quot;, which used all-caps to &quot;yell&quot;, and Robert Moses, who in the 1970s used all caps to &quot;convey rage&quot; at a draft of a book.
::* Online newsgroups and bulletin board posts from around 1984 show that a user still needed to explain that &quot;if it&#x27;s in caps i&#x27;m trying to YELL&quot;, or that &quot;Capitalizing whole words gives the impression that you&#x27;re shouting&quot;. Another summed up that there seemed to be a developing consensus that emphasis was given to words via all caps, or by surrounding them with asterisks.

== Usage ==
===Print media===
Before the development of lower-case letters in the 8th century, texts in the Latin alphabet were written in a single case, which is now considered to be capital letters. Text in all caps is not widely used in body copy. The main exception to this is the so-called fine print in legal documents.

Capital letters have been widely used in printed headlines from the early days of newspapers until the 1950s. In the 1990s, more than three-quarters of newspapers in the western world used lower-case letters in headline text. Discussion regarding the use of all caps for headlines centers on the greater emphasis offered by all caps versus the greater legibility offered by lower-case letters. Colin Wheildon conducted a scientific study with 224 readers who analyzed various headline styles and concluded that &quot;Headlines set in capital letters are significantly less legible than those set in lower case.&quot;

===Computing===
All caps typography was common on teletype machines, such as those used by police departments, news, and the United States&#x27; then-called Weather Bureau, as well as early computers, such as certain early Apple II models and the ZX81, which had a limited support for lower-case text. This changed as full support of ASCII became standard, allowing lower-case characters.

Some Soviet computers, such as Radio-86RK, Vector-06C, Agat-7, use 7-bit encoding called KOI-7N2, where capital Cyrillic letters replace lower-case Latin letters in the ASCII table, so can display both alphabets, but all caps only. Mikrosha is switchable to KOI-7N1, in this mode, it can display both caps and lower-case, but in Cyrillic only. Other Soviet computers, such as BK0010, MK 85, Corvette and Agat-9, use 8-bit encoding called KOI-8R, they can display both Cyrillic and Latin in caps and lower-case.

Many, but not all, NES games use all caps because of tile graphics, where charset and tiles share the same ROM. Game designers often choose to have less characters in favor of more tiles.
With the advent of the bulletin board system, or BBS, and later the Internet, typing messages in all caps commonly became closely identified with &quot;shouting&quot; or attention-seeking behavior, and may be considered rude. Its equivalence to shouting traces back to at least 1984 and before the Internet, back to printed typography usage of all capitals to mean shouting.

For this reason, etiquette generally discourages the use of all caps when posting messages online. While all caps can be used as an alternative to rich-text &quot;bolding&quot; for a single word or phrase, to express emphasis, repeated use of all caps can be considered &quot;shouting&quot; or irritating.

Some aspects of Microsoft&#x27;s Metro design language involve the use of all caps headings and titles. This has received particular attention when menu and ribbon titles appeared in all caps in Visual Studio 2012 and Office 2013, respectively. Critics have compared this to a computer program shouting at its user. Information technology journalist Lee Hutchinson described Microsoft&#x27;s using the practice as &quot;LITERALLY TERRIBLE ... [it] doesn&#x27;t so much violate OS X&#x27;s design conventions as it does take them out behind the shed, pour gasoline on them, and set them on fire.&quot;

In programming, writing in all caps (possibly with underscores replacing spaces) is an identifier naming convention in many programming languages that symbolizes that the given identifier represents a constant.

===Surnames===
A practice exists (most commonly in Francophone countries) of distinguishing the surname from the rest of a personal name by stylizing the surname only in all caps. This practice is also common among Japanese, when names are spelled using Roman letters.

===Military communication===
In April 2013, the U.S. Navy moved away from an all caps-based messaging system, which was begun with 1850s-era teleprinters that had only uppercase letters. The switch to mixed-case communications was estimated to save the Navy $20 million a year and is compliant with current Internet protocol.

===Contract law===

An antiquated practice that still remains in use, especially by older American lawyers who grew up before the arrival of computers, is to use all caps text for text that is legally required to be emphasised and clearly readable. The practice dates to the period of typewriters, which generally did not offer bold text, small capitals, or the opportunity to add marginal notes emphasising key points. 

Legal writing expert Bryan A. Garner has described the practice as &quot;ghastly&quot;. A 2020 study found that all-caps in legal texts is ineffective and is, in fact, harmful to older readers. In 2002, a US court spoke out against the practice, ruling that simply making text all-capitals has no bearing on whether it is clear and easily readable:

Lawyers who think their caps lock keys are instant &quot;make conspicuous&quot; buttons are deluded. In determining whether a term is conspicuous, we look at more than formatting. A term that appears in capitals can still be inconspicuous if it is hidden on the back of a contract in small type. Terms that are in capitals but also appear in hard-to-read type may flunk the conspicuousness test. A sentence in capitals, buried deep within a long paragraph in capitals will probably not be deemed conspicuous...it is entirely possible for text to be conspicuous without being in capitals.

===Pop culture===
Certain musicians—such as Marina, Finneas, who are both known mononymously, and MF DOOM—as well as some bands such as Haim and Kiss—have their names stylised in all caps. Additionally, it is common for bands with vowelless names (a process colourfully known as &quot;disemvoweling&quot;) to use all caps, with prominent examples including STRFKR, MSTRKRFT, PWR BTTM, SBTRKT, JPNSGRLS (now known as Hotel Mira), BLK JKS, MNDR, and DWNTWN.

== Readability ==
Miles Tinker, renowned for his landmark work, &quot;Legibility of Print&quot;, performed scientific studies on the legibility and readability of all-capital print. His findings were as follows:

 All-capital print greatly retards speed of reading in comparison with lower-case type. Also, most readers judge all capitals to be less legible. Faster reading of the lower-case print is due to the characteristic word forms furnished by this type. This permits reading by word units, while all capitals tend to be read letter by letter. Furthermore, since all-capital printing takes at least one-third more space than lower case, more fixation pauses are required for reading the same amount of material. The use of all capitals should be dispensed with in every printing situation.

According to Tinker, &quot;As early as 1914, Starch reported that material set in Roman lower case was read somewhat faster than similar material printed in all capitals.&quot; Another study in 1928 showed that &quot;all-capital text was read 11.8 percent slower than lower case, or approximately 38 words per minute slower&quot;, and that &quot;nine-tenths of adult readers consider lower case more legible than all capitals&quot;.

A 1955 study by Miles Tinker showed that &quot;all-capital text retarded speed of reading from 9.5 to 19.0 percent for the 5 and 10-minute time limits, and 13.9 percent for the whole 20-minute period&quot;. Tinker concluded that, &quot;Obviously, all-capital printing slows reading to a marked degree in comparison with Roman lower case.&quot;

Tinker provides the following explanations for why all capital printing is more difficult to read: Text in all capitals covers about 35 percent more printing surface than the same material set in lower case. This would tend to increase the reading time. When this is combined with the difficulty in reading words in all-capital letters as units, the hindrance to rapid reading becomes marked. In the eye-movement study by Tinker and Patterson, the principal difference in oculomotor patterns between lower case and all capitals was the very large increase in number of fixation pauses for reading the all-capital print.

All caps text should be eliminated from most forms of composition, according to Tinker: 

Colin Wheildon stated that there is an &quot;apparent consensus&quot; that lower-case text is more legible, but that some editors continue to use all caps in text regardless. In his studies of all caps in headlines, he states that, &quot;Editors who favor capitals claim that they give greater emphasis. Those who prefer lower case claim their preferences gives greater legibility.&quot; Wheildon, who informs us that &quot;When a person reads a line of type, the eye recognizes letters by the shapes of their upper halves&quot;, asserts that recognizing words in all caps &quot;becomes a task instead of a natural process&quot;. His conclusions, based on scientific testing in 1982–1990, are: &quot;Headlines set in capital letters are significantly less legible than those set in lower case.&quot;

John Ryder, in the &quot;Case for Legibility&quot;, stated that &quot;Printing with capital letters can be done sufficiently well to arouse interest and, with short lines, reading at a slowed speed is possible – but in principle too many factors of low legibility are involved.&quot;

Other critics are of the opinion that all caps letters in text are often &quot;too tightly packed against each other&quot;.

===Ambiguities===

Besides the aforementioned speed of reading, all caps is prone to character-based ambiguities.

Namely, the upper-case letters are globally simpler than their lower-case counterpart. For example, they lack ascenders and descenders.
Since they are built from fewer positional and building elements (e.g. a smaller grid pertaining to minimalist digital fonts), they are more fragile to small changes.

These variations, generally involuntary but sometimes induced on purpose, are caused by a misinterpretation (the information is transferred) or by a deterioration (the data is lost, in the analysis wording). They can occur horizontally and/or vertically, while misreading (without this extra effort or time), or during a delicate scanning of characters (from a damaged image that needs further contextual text correction).

Depending on the typeface, these similarities accidentally create various duplicates (even quite briefly and without realizing it when reading).
E.g. H/A, F/E or I/T by adding a bar; P/R, O/Q, even C/G from similar errors; V/U, D/O, even B/S while rounding the shape; and more deformations implying mixings.

Adding digits in all caps styled texts may multiply these confusions, which is one aim of Leet (intentional pseudo duplicates) and can provide simple means of concealing messages (often numbers).

<text>The Beaumont Enterprise is a newspaper of Hearst Communications, headquartered in Beaumont, Texas. It has been in operation since 1880.

==History==
John W. Leonard founded the initial &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a weekly newspaper in 1880. It became a daily under editor W.W. McLeod in 1896 or 1897, to compete with crosstown rival &quot;Beaumont Journal&quot; (founded 1889).

In 1907, William P. Hobby became manager and part owner of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and bought the paper outright in 1920, while Governor of Texas. One of his co-owners was general manager/associate publisher James Mapes. According to the Texas State Historical Association, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;attained national stature&quot; under Mapes&#x27; leadership — He came to the newspaper in 1908 and rose to ownership by 1931.

In 1918, Waco-based newspapermen Charles E. Marsh and E.S. Fentress purchased the crosstown competitor &quot;Beaumont Journal&quot;. Buying two other nearby papers (the weekly &quot;Port Arthur News&quot; and the daily &quot;Orange Leader&quot;), the pair boosted the &quot;Journal&quot; circulation and eventually Hobby bought the &quot;Journal&quot;.

Jefferson-Pilot bought the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; in 1970. Operating separately under the same company for many years, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; merged in 1983. The Hearst Corporation acquired the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the Jefferson-Pilot insurance company&#x27;s publications arm in 1984.

<text>RewardsCentral (formerly EmailCash Marketing, formerly TEMPNAME) is an Australian website run by PermissionCorp,
with branches for residents of Australia, Taiwan, 
New Zealand (SmileCity), 
and United Kingdom (Rewards Central). The company was founded by Bob Cheng in Sydney, Australia, in 1999. EmailCash was ranked 40th in Business Review Weekly&#x27;s Fast 100 index for 2004.

==Operation==
The company is based on a reward program, the company rewards members with points when they perform certain tasks. These include participation in market research surveys, completion of promotional offers, a daily &#x27;Quick Survey&#x27; and visiting specified websites.

==Survey Rewards==
At the beginning of 2012, the Australian website claimed 200,000,000 points ($2 million) and $40,000 in competition prizes were paid out to members annually for completed surveys. While unable to confirm the number of points awarded to members each year, it was observed and reported in RewardsCentral own website that less than $40,000 was paid out annually in the past two years. In 2011, the quarterly $10,000 competition was only drawn twice, once in March and once in October. A third draw was originally scheduled in June 2011, delayed to July 2011 and eventually cancelled with no explanation to members other than the competition being termed &quot;over&quot; and entries for the competition carrying over to the October draw. Competition winners as shown on RewardsCentral Website show only three winners of the $10,000 competition in 2010. In 2012 the first $10,000 draw occurred in January with the next draw not scheduled until July.

At the end of May 2012 RewardsCentral altered the cash paid out for the competition to $20,000 a year, halving the benefit for screened out surveys for its members. In an effort to make this alteration appear the equivalent of other survey sites the alteration also changed the expected pay-outs on competitors&#x27; sites which have not occurred. This alteration still has not explained the underpayment of benefits to members of previous years.

<doc id="1171275" wikidata="Q1650718" url="?curid=1171275" title="Kompot">
<text>Kompot or compot, as prepared in Central and Eastern Europe and West Asia, refers to boiled fruits (typically fresh or dried) served either as a drink or a dessert depending on the region. When served as a dessert, it is essentially identical to the French &quot;compote,&quot; which is where the term &quot;kompot&quot; originates from. When served as a drink, it is also known as vzvar (взвар) or uzvar (узвар), from a Slavic root word meaning &quot;to boil&quot;.

As a drink, kompot is a sweet, non-alcoholic beverage that may be served hot or cold, depending on tradition and season. It is created by cooking fruit such as strawberries, apricots, peaches, apples, raspberries, rhubarb, plums, or sour cherries in a large volume of water, often together with sugar, honey, or raisins as additional sweeteners. Sometimes different spices, such as vanilla or cinnamon, are added for additional flavour, especially in the winter, when kompot is usually served hot. Kompot is popular in Central and Eastern European countries, as well as in Southern Europe.

Kompot is part of the cuisine of many countries in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe, as well as in the Middle East and West Asia. It is known by a variety of names in these countries, such as &quot;компот&quot; (kompot) in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian, &quot;kompót&quot; in Slovak and Hungarian, &quot;kompotas&quot; in Lithuanian, &quot;κομπόστα&quot; (kompósta) in Greek, and &quot;komposto&quot; in Turkish. Making kompot was a common way of preserving fruit for the winter in Southern and Eastern European countries; in 1885, Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa wrote in a recipe book that kompot &quot;preserved fruit so well it seemed fresh&quot;. Kompot is also popular in many Central Asian countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

In the colder parts of Europe, instead of stewing the fruits and then preserving the result, the fruits are dried and then rehydrated to make kompot. This method is notably used in the twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper prepared in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The consumption of kompot has been declining since the 1980s. With the end of food preservation in many Southern and Eastern European countries, kompot has been supplanted by fruit juice, soft drinks and mineral water.

<doc id="1171278" wikidata="Q682990" url="?curid=1171278" title="Vlaams Belang">
<text>Vlaams Belang (; ; VB) is a Flemish nationalist, Eurosceptic and right-wing populist political party in the Flemish Region and Brussels Capital Region of Belgium. It is widely considered by the media and political analysts to be on the political far-right, although it self-describes as right-nationalist and has tried to distance itself from the far-right label in recent years.

Vlaams Belang is a rebrand of &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;, which was dissolved after it was condemned for espousing racism during a trial which was held in 2004. After it reorganized itself as Vlaams Belang, it continued to espouse the core philosophy of its predecessor by campaigning on a separatist and Flemish nationalist platform. It also supports the maintenance of Flemish cultural identity, it opposes multiculturalism, and it advocates the imposition of tougher law &amp; order policies. However, the VB toned its rhetoric down and it also implemented some changes in the more controversial portions of the former &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; statute and has sought to change its image from a radical to a more conservative party by distancing itself from some of its former programs. Nonetheless, most other parties initially continued the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; which was implemented against the former party, effectively blocking the Vlaams Belang from taking part in government at any level. Additionally, attempts on cutting public subsidies specifically for the party were made through the Belgian draining law.

Like &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;, Vlaams Belang was initially popular among the Flemish electorate and it was also one of the most successful nationalist-populist parties in Europe. However, from 2008, the party experienced a downturn in support and membership, a situation which coincided with internal problems which existed within the party and the rise of the more moderate nationalist New Flemish Alliance, which, at the time, supported Flemish independence. Under the current leadership of Tom Van Grieken, the VB has begun to regain popular support and as a result, it made a comeback during the 2019 federal elections. Following the election, there has been some media speculation that the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of the party may be lifted for the first time. By 2021, the VB had again grown into one of the largest parties in the Flemish region.

== History ==

=== Background: Vlaams Blok ===

The direct predecessor of the Vlaams Belang was the Vlaams Blok, which was formed by the nationalist right-wing and national conservative faction within the People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Volksunie&quot;, VU) which had emerged in the late 1970s. The ideology of the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People&#x27;s Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, and later increasingly focused on immigration and security, exploitation of political scandals, and defense of traditional values. The immigration positions of the Vlaams Blok were subject to much controversy, particularly after the party released its 70-point plan, and the Vlaams Blok was forced to disband in 2004 after being found to sanctioned illegal discrimination. By then, the party was the most popular Flemish party, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, and was one of the most successful parties considered to be right-wing populist in Europe as a whole.

In Belgium in 2001, Roeland Raes, the ideologue and vice-president of Vlaams Blok, gave an interview to Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis&#x27; use of gas chambers and the authenticity of Anne Frank&#x27;s diary. The interview was met with uproar within the party with the VB&#x27;s leadership immediately distancing themselves from Raes and holding an emergency meeting on whether to expel him. According to political scientist Cas Mudde, the Vlaams Blok had campaigned on heavy anti-immigration themes but had positioned itself against antisemitism and Holocaust denial. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.

Upon complaints filed by the governmental Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism and the Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium, in 2001 three non-profit organisations that in effect constituted the core of the Vlaams Blok party were charged with violation of the Law on Racism and xenophobia by assisting &quot;a group or organisation that clearly and repeatedly commits discrimination or segregation,&quot; here the political party. By April 2004, the Appellate Court of Ghent came to a final verdict, forbidding their and the party&#x27;s continued existence for its &quot;repeated incitement to discrimination.&quot; The trial was met with intense debate and mixed reactions, with the Vlaams Blok leadership and some political commentators arguing the trial was a politically motivated attempt by the Belgian establishment to destroy the party. In November that year, the Court of Cassation rejected their last appeal to annul the verdict; the delay had allowed using the name Vlaams Blok for election candidacy.

=== Vlaams Belang (2004–2008) ===
After the Supreme Court ruling, the leadership of the VB seized the occasion to dissolve itself, and start afresh under a new name. On 14 November, the Vlaams Blok thus disbanded itself, and the Vlaams Belang was established. Other proposed names had included the &quot;Flemish People&#x27;s Party&quot; and &quot;Flemish Freedom Front.&quot; The Vlaams Belang also instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating or discarding some of the more radical positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leader Frank Vanhecke made it clear that the party would fundamentally remain the same; &quot;We change our name, but not our tricks. We change our name, but not our programme.&quot;

Former Vlaams Blok chairman Frank Vanhecke was chosen as chairman of the Vlaams Belang on 12 December 2004. Despite efforts to tone down parts of the party&#x27;s platform, the Vlaams Belang has continued to be subjected to the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; like its predecessor, wherein all the traditional Flemish parties have agreed to systematically exclude the party, and never form a coalition with it. This situation was however altered slightly with the emergence of the smaller right-wing party List Dedecker (founded in 2007), which did not joined in on the agreement and argued that the cordon was ineffective. Nevertheless, in an interview with the popular weekly &quot;Humo&quot;, Flemish Prime Minister Yves Leterme for instance declared that a local chapter of his Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V) that would form a coalition or close agreements with the Vlaams Belang, would no longer be considered part of the CD&amp;V.

The VB contested the 2006 municipal elections on the theme of &quot;Secure, Flemish, Liveable&quot;. The VB enjoyed a massive increase of votes, and its council members almost doubled, from 439 to about 800. The election result was described by the party as a &quot;landslide victory.&quot; In Antwerp, the VB&#x27;s vote count ran behind that of the Socialist Party, which increased their share of the vote dramatically. However, the VB, which was in a coalition with the minor VLOTT party, slightly increased their vote in the city to 33.5%. In the 2007 general election, the party won 17 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and five seats in the Senate, remaining more or less at &quot;status quo&quot;. Earlier the same year, the party joined the short-lived European Parliament group Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty alongside parties such as the French National Front.

=== Decline and internal strife (2008–2018) ===
In 2008, Bruno Valkeniers was chosen as new party chairman for the VB, having contested the position unopposed. In 2009, the party contested elections for the Flemish Parliament and the European Parliament. The party was reduced from 32 to 21 seats (from the Vlaams Blok&#x27;s record 24%, to 15%) in the Flemish parliament, and from three to two seats in the European parliament. In the 2010 general election, the party was again reduced, to 12 seats in the Chamber, and three in the Senate. This was largely due to the great success of the more moderate new party New Flemish Alliance, which also campaigned on Flemish independence and took many of the VB&#x27;s votes. Around this time, the VB also saw several high-profile members defect from or quit the party, such as former leader Frank Vanhecke. After the party suffered heavy losses during the local elections of 2012 Bruno Valkeniers stepped down as party chairman and was succeeded by Gerolf Annemans.

In the 2014 federal and regional elections, the party again suffered a big loss; it was reduced to 5.9% of the Flemish vote. The European list, pulled by Annemans, scored slightly better with 6.8%. Annemans resigned as party leader, a function he only performed for two years, and argued for a rejuvenation of the party. The following party chairman election was won by the only candidate, Tom Van Grieken, then 28 years old and at the time the youngest leader of a political party in Belgium. After assuming leadership of the party, Van Grieken sought to soften and moderate its image further.

=== Resurgence (2018–present) ===
During the 2018 Belgian local elections, the party saw a resurgence in support, obtaining 13.1% of the Flemish vote with an outlier of more than 40% in the city of Ninove where it fought locally under the name of &quot;Forza Ninove.&quot; The party also led a campaign against the Global Compact for Migration, which some commentators credit to successfully pressuring the rival N-VA to adopt a position against the Compact.

On May 26, 2019, in what was known as &quot;Super Sunday&quot; in Belgium (owing to the fact the Federal, Regional and European elections took place on the same day) the party made substantial gains in all three elections which some political analysts described as a significant comeback.

The party polled second place in the Flemish region with 18.6% of the overall vote, increasing its number of MPs in the Chamber of Representatives to 18 (its best result since 2007). In the Flemish Parliament the party also finished second, gaining 23 representatives. The party&#x27;s campaign was managed by Bart Claes. Political analysts noted that the VB saw an increase in support among voters under 30 which was attributed to the party&#x27;s use of social media campaigning.

In response to the results, there was some speculation that the N-VA leader Bart De Wever would break the &quot;Cordon sanitaire&quot; imposed on the party after he decided to hold talks with the VB as part of the coalition formation on the Flemish level, as their strong results made forming a coalition without them more difficult. The ending of the Cordon Sanitaire was further speculated after the VB leader Tom Van Grieken was invited to a customary meeting with King Philippe for the first time along with the leaders of the other main parties. The former &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; party had previously been denied a meeting with the King in 1991 and 2003. Eventually, the party remained in opposition both at the regional and federal level, as, with the exception of N-VA, no other party was found willing to break the cordon.

During the 2024 Belgian federal election, the European and regional elections which again took place on the same day, the VB made further gains in all, including polling in first place in the Flemish electoral college for the European elections and finishing joint first in the Flemish parliament, but didn&#x27;t see as many gains as initially predicted by opinion surveys in the Federal Parliament where the N-VA remained as the largest Flemish party.

In the 2024 Belgian local elections, Guy D&#x27;haeseleer became Vlaams Belang&#x27;s first ever elected mayor, after the party secured an absolute majority on the Ninove municipal council. In Ranst the cordon sanitaire on the party was officially broken for the first time when two local parties &quot;Vrij Ranst&quot; and &quot;PIT,&quot; the latter of which contains CD&amp;V members and is headed by former Open VLD mayor Lode Hofmans agreed to form a governing coalition with Vlaams Belang.

== Ideology ==
The policies of the Vlaams Belang focus mainly on the issues of Flemish independence, opposition to multiculturalism, and defence of traditional Western values. By 2021, media commentators described the party as coming to contain two large factions: the more conservative &quot;salonfähige&quot; wing, who wish to moderate the party in order to break the cordon sanitaire by implementing a policy of &quot;de-demonizing&quot; the VB, taking inspiration from other European parties and politicians such as Marine Le Pen and the French National Rally; and a more radical and traditionalist wing who held ties to groups like the Order of Flemish Militants.

=== Domestic policy ===
The Vlaams Belang supports returning Brussels to the full control of Flemish region as opposed to its current state as a bilingual capital region. It also wants Dutch to be the sole official language of Flanders. The party also favours abolishing the Belgian Senate.

Although the party almost exclusively stands in the Flemish region of Belgium, it ran a list of candidates in the Walloon Brabant electoral district in 2007 as a protest against the lack of splitting between Flemish and Francophone communities in Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.

=== Flemish nationalism ===
The VB&#x27;s main goal is to establish an independent Flemish republic. The party seeks a peaceful secession of Flanders from Belgium, citing in its program the dissolution of the Union between Sweden and Norway (1905), Czechoslovakia (1992), and the independence of Montenegro (2006) as examples that such would be possible. The reason to seek independence is given as the &quot;enormous cultural and political differences between Flemings and Walloons,&quot; and according to the party, Belgian governments are also &quot;paralyzed by ongoing disputes between Flemish and Walloon politicians.&quot; Other stated reasons given for secessionism are the financial transfers from Flanders to the capital of Brussels and to Wallonia (Belgium&#x27;s other half), which Vlaams Belang considers to be unjustified. Members of Vlaams Belang argue that the French speaking Socialist Party de facto rules Belgium and does not represent the interests of Flemish voters. The party also calls for the exclusive use of the Dutch language in Flanders and for compulsory measures that both immigrants and Francophone residents of Flanders learn to speak Dutch. In contrast to its &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; predecessor, the VB has downplayed and placed less emphasis on ethnonationalism in recent years when discussing Flemish national identity. Political author Hans-Georg Betz noted that the party no longer features the ethnically defined version of people (&quot;volk&quot;) that was featured in the former Vlaams Blok &quot;Own People First&quot; slogan and instead uses the neutral sounding &quot;Mensen&quot; — the Dutch word for human beings in its messages.

==== Immigration and minorities ====
The Vlaams Belang official immigration policy has been slightly moderated from that of the former Vlaams Blok. After updating its platform, the party simply called for the repatriation of those immigrants who &quot;reject, deny or combat&quot; Flemish culture as well as certain European values, including freedom of expression and equality between men and women. In its current platform, the VB states that it supports immigrants who can assimilate into Flemish culture, but positions itself against mass immigration in Belgium, calling for tightened laws on family migration, a complete freeze on what it terms as non-essential immigration and expulsion of unemployed foreign nationals.

In 2021, Vlaams Belang called for the formation of an &quot;Agency for Remigration&quot;.

The former Vlaams Blok was, according to political scientist Cas Mudde, only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned by the party leadership. Accused of being anti-Muslim, the party favors the expulsion of all who opposed Western values and after the 2016 Brussels bombings, called for closed borders and a temporary stop to immigration. The party is also opposed to what it regards as lenient immigration policies and state multiculturalism forced on the Flemish region by the Belgian federal government and the European Union, arguing that such policies leave Flanders vulnerable to terrorism and have eroded Flemish culture. It also states that immigrants must adapt to Flemish values and culture rather than Flanders having to change to adopt the cultures of migrants, and that immigrants who cannot adapt to Flemish culture or laws should be offered incentives to voluntarily repatriate themselves. The party also supports the expulsion of illegal immigrants and foreign residents with criminal records from Flanders.

Currently, the party is seen as anti-Islam, while being strongly pro-Israel, regarding Jews and Israelis as allies against radical Islam. Filip Dewinter, for example, has stated that women wearing the hijab have &quot;effectively signed their contract for deportation.&quot; Initially, members of Belgium&#x27;s Jewish community boycotted the party due to the stigma of wartime collaborationism associated with Flemish nationalism and the fact the VB&#x27;s &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; predecessor contained founders who had collaborated with the Nazis. However, in Antwerp sections of the city&#x27;s large Jewish community now actively support the party, as they feel threatened by the new wave of anti-Semitism from the growing Muslim population. The VB&#x27;s list for the 2024 municipal elections in Antwerp includes a practicing Jewish candidate for the first time. In 2010, the party was part of a delegation to Israel (along with some other rightist parties), where they issued the &quot;Jerusalem Declaration,&quot; which defended the right of Israel to exist and defend itself against terrorism. Israeli Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara in turn visited the party in Antwerp in 2011. In March 2014, a party mission headed by Dewinter visited Israel and met with Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office Ofir Akunis. and Samaria Regional Council, Gershon Mesika and Yossi Dagan.

=== Social issues ===
Like its predecessor, the Vlaams Belang was initially opposed to same-sex marriage and instead advocated civil partnerships for same-sex couples. After assuming leadership, Tom Van Grieken stated that the party had dropped its campaign against gay marriage. In 2014, the party moderated its stance and changed its policy to support same-sex marriage. This more moderate stance has not been widely accepted by all party members. On abortion the party is socially conservative. According to Vlaams Belang abortion should only be possible when the woman&#x27;s life is in danger, when the unborn child is not viable and in the case of rape.

==== Law and order ====
In order to secure Flemish cities, the party wants to implement a policy of zero tolerance. It supports the abolition of the Belgian parole law, which allows convicts to be released after only one third of their prison sentence has been served. The party also opposes drug liberalization. Citing &quot;a massive overrepresentation of immigrants in crime statistics,&quot; the party also wants to deport criminal and illegal foreigners, as well as seeking to &quot;combat Islamic terror threat.&quot;

=== Economy ===
The party&#x27;s economic policy has been changed significantly from the Vlaams Blok. While the Vlaams Blok called for a rather mixed economy, the Vlaams Belang moved towards neoliberalism. However, for the 2019 federal election, the party returned to a protectionist economic program. A 2023 study by Koen Abts of the &quot;Institute for Social and Political Opinion Research&quot; at KU Leuven documented the VB&#x27;s economic position as somewhere between protectionism and economic liberalism.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== European Union ====
The party describes itself as pro-European in terms of protecting European culture and cooperation between nations to secure peace, but takes a eurosceptic stance towards the European Union and its structures as a whole and argues the EU does not financially benefit Flanders or respect national identities of member states. Political commentators have described the VB as for many years and until recently being Belgium&#x27;s only and most distinct EU-critical party. In its program, the VB is strongly against any evolution towards a Federal European Superstate, argues for Flemish withdrawal from the Schengen Area and the reinstatement of border controls, abolition of the Eurozone and opposes the accession of Turkey to the European Union. The party states that it supports cooperation of European nations for economic trade and to give Flanders political visibility but calls for the EU to be fundamentally changed into a smaller confederal union of independent nations or abolished if it becomes a Federal Superstate and imposes further open border policies on Flanders.

==== Russia and Ukraine ====
The VB was previously critical of imposing sanctions against Russia and was accused of fostering links to Putin&#x27;s government with some members of the party visiting representatives of Putin, but following the Russian invasion of Ukraine the party&#x27;s leadership have condemned the invasion and distanced themselves from Putin with VB politician Filip Dewinter stating Putin had &quot;totally lost it.&quot; 

VB leader Tom Van Grieken also stated in 2022 that the party &quot;thought at one point Putin was an ally in the fight against multiculturalism, but now it appears we were grossly mistaken&quot; and referred to Putin as a &quot;dictator who commits atrocities.&quot; 

However, the party remains critical of the impact of sanctions against Russia on fuel prices in Belgium. Since the invasion, the VB has supported supplying humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, issuing a statement saying &quot;we have always spoken out in favor of supplying defensive equipment and weapons to Ukraine, so that it can defend its sovereign territory against Russian aggression&quot; but has also criticised the financial extent of Belgian military support for Ukraine.

==== Middle East ====
The VB condemned the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, with Van Grieken calling for an end to development aid to the Palestinian territories and criticising the Belgian government for not more clearly describing the attack as a terrorist attack. Van Grieken has affirmed VB&#x27;s support for Israel&#x27;s right to exist, opposition to any arms embargo or boycott against Israel, and support for a two-state solution, though he has stated that the two-state solution cannot be implemented until Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israel cease. Though Van Grieken initially stated that VB would not take sides in the Israel–Hamas war, he later described Israel&#x27;s fight against Islamist terrorism as a &quot;fight for the whole world&quot; as part of a &quot;permanent struggle against radical Islam&quot;.

== Public reception ==
=== Political position and labels === 
Like its predecessor, Vlaams Belang has been accused of racism and for promoting hostility and xenophobia by both French and Dutch speaking political opponents and media in Belgium. Although the VB has a large conservative following in the Flemish region, some journalists and political commentators have historically been divided on whether to refer to the VB as a conservative, far-right or an extreme-right party. Individuals associated with the party such as VB spokesman Filip Dewinter and former independent MP Dries Van Langenhove, have been accused of tapping into the Great Replacement theory by using the term &quot;omvolking&quot; (population replacement) when discussing immigration. The VB itself has disputed the extreme or far-right label in recent years. 

The party itself has repeatedly denied that it is racist and believes such accusations are based on attempts to discredit the party. Politicians, like former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (VLD) and Karel De Gucht (VLD) have called the Vlaams Belang and its leaders &quot;fascist&quot;. However, history professor Eric Defoort has stated the use of this terminology creates &quot;a distorted image of their antagonist, whom they can then scold with missionary zeal.&quot;

=== Collaboration and &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; === 
Since its founding, most parties in Belgium have refused to cooperate with the VB and in 2004 continued the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; on the party in the Federal Parliament. 

In 2011, all the French speaking Belgian parties in the Federal parliament, as well as the Flemish Groen! and sp.a, called on the Belgian Council of State to withdraw all allocation of parliamentary money to the party, claiming statements and policies proposed by its leadership violated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, the Council of State rejected the calls, arguing that the party had not violated the rules of the ECHR and that other accusations made against the party were based on old evidence revolving around the former &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; trial. The VB&#x27;s leadership described the accusations against the party as politically motivated and undemocratic.

Although collaboration with the party still remains controversial within some political circles, more mainstream Belgian politicians have started to discuss the possibility of including the party in coalition talks and lifting the cordon sanitaire, arguing that the VB&#x27;s gradual moderation and growth in support cannot be ignored and that some of the policies the party has campaigned on have since been adopted by the main parties.

=== Ali statement ===
In 2006 Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a prominent critic of Islam in the Netherlands, and to whom Vlaams Belang on different occasions referred to defend its points of view on Islam, called the party &quot;a racist, anti-Semitic, extremist party that is unkind to women and that should be outlawed.&quot; The party responded that Ali had been misinformed and considered this to be part of a smear campaign. Vlaams Belang underlined that Ali supposedly made the statement on the occasion of a debate organised by the left-liberal think tank Liberales, whose president is Dirk Verhofstadt who is known for regularly publishing accusations against the party. Vlaams Belang also wrote an open letter to Ali supporting her work. 

=== Raes controversy ===
In September 2024, the party sparked controversy by putting Roeland Raes who had previously been convicted of Holocaust denial as one of its candidates in the upcoming municipal elections before removing his candidacy the following day.

=== International relations ===
In the European Parliament, the party has generally been part of the Non-Inscrits. In 2007, the party was however part of the short-lived European Parliament group Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty alongside parties such as the French National Front. The party has also had some contacts with the Freedom Party of Austria, the Italian Northern League, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Slovak National Party, the now-defunct German Freedom Party, and the Sweden Democrats.

In October 2007, the party hosted the international counter-jihad conference in the European and Flemish Parliaments in Brussels together with Edward &quot;Ned&quot; May of the blog &quot;Gates of Vienna&quot;, which brought together many counter-jihad ideologues including Bat Ye&#x27;or, Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer, Gerard Batten, Hans Jansen, Andrew G. Bostom, Paul Beliën, Aryeh Eldad and Lars Hedegaard.

In the ninth European Parliament, the party sat with France&#x27;s National Rally, Italy&#x27;s Lega Nord, the Freedom Party of Austria, Alternative for Germany and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia in the Identity and Democracy parliamentary group. In 2024, the party&#x27;s relations with the AfD became somewhat strained due to statements made by AfD candidates on Nazi Germany with the VB&#x27;s European delegation saying it would wait until after the 2024 European election to see if the two parties would continue collaborating. In September 2024, VB issued a statement congratulating the AfD for its strong result in the 2024 state elections in Saxony and Thuringia.

In the tenth European Parliament, the VB announced it would join the Patriots for Europe group, which was founded by Viktor Orban, the leader of the Hungarian Fidesz party.

Outside the EU, it has ties to the Israeli Likud, the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, the Serbian People&#x27;s Party, South Africa&#x27;s Freedom Front Plus, and the US Republican Party.

<text>Shannon Wheeler is an American cartoonist, best known as a cartoonist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and for creating the satirical superhero Too Much Coffee Man.

==Early life==
Shannon Wheeler grew up in Berkeley, California, brought up by his mother. His father left the family to start a commune north of San Francisco. Wheeler also has two half-sisters. Wheeler attended the Walden Center and School. He later attended Berkeley High School, eventually graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in architecture in 1989.

==Career ==
He started cartooning while at UC Berkeley, publishing his daily gag cartoons &quot;Calaboose&quot; and then &quot;Tooth and Justice&quot; in &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;.

Around 1990, he moved to Austin, Texas, a state he had visited multiple times as a child to see family. In Austin, Wheeler continued &quot;Tooth and Justice&quot; for the University of Texas student paper &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;. Ending that strip, he published other daily cartoons with the paper, with titles like &quot;Life and Times&quot; and &quot;Interlude&quot;.

In 1991, Wheeler created the satirical superhero Too Much Coffee Man to star in a minicomic promoting &quot;Children with Glue&quot;, a collection of his daily strips. The popularity of Too Much Coffee Man led to the character starring in a weekly comic strip in 1991. The character appeared in a series of self-published zines, comic books, magazines, and webcomics for a number of years. After Wheeler moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1998, Dark Horse Comics (based nearby) began publishing &quot;TMCM&quot; collections. In 2006 Wheeler and Daniel Steven Crafts co-produced the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Opera&quot; (in one act), followed by &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Opera, The Refill&quot; (in two acts) in 2008. Dark Horse released the ultimate TMCM collection in 2011, the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Omnibus&quot;; while BOOM! Studios released &quot;Too Much Coffee Man: Cutie Island and Other Stories&quot; in 2012.

From 2004 until 2008, Wheeler contributed to many of the Idiot&#x27;s Guide books.

His weekly strip &quot;Postage Stamp Funnies&quot; appeared in the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; until 2009, when he began contributing to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. In 2010, Boom! Studios published a collection of Wheeler&#x27;s cartoons that had been rejected by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;I Thought You Would Be Funnier&quot;. While initially left off the ballot for the Eisner Awards for 2011, the book went on to win Best Humor publication that year.

==Personal life==
Wheeler lives in Portland, Oregon, with his twin sons.

<text>Richard O&#x27;Sullivan (born 7 May 1944) is an English comedy actor. He is known for his role as Robin Tripp in the TV sitcoms &quot;Man About the House&quot; (1973–1976) and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1977–1981) and as the title character in the period adventure series &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1979–1982). He also starred in &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1971), &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot; (1972–1973), &quot;Alcock and Gander&quot; (1972), &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; (1984–1988) and &quot;Trouble In Mind&quot; (1991).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Sullivan was born in 1944 to John and Ellen O&#x27;Sullivan (née Fleming) in Chiswick, where he grew up with his younger brother. His early education was at St John the Evangelist&#x27;s RC Primary School in Brentford, Middlesex. After a family holiday in Ireland as a boy, he returned with a strong Irish accent and was sent to the Corona Theatre School to soften it. He appeared in his first film at the age of eight.

==Career as child actor==
O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first film appearance was as an extra playing one of the children singing in the Sunday School sequence of &quot;The Yellow Balloon&quot;, filmed in 1952 when he was eight years old and released in 1953. He then played the main character in &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Hand&quot;, starring Alida Valli and Trevor Howard, in 1953. 
Possibly his earliest television work was the part he played in the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; episode, &quot;The Unlucky Gambler&quot;, broadcast on 18 July 1955. He appeared in the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation&#x27;s first serial, &quot;Raiders of the River&quot;, also produced in 1955. In the film &quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Young&quot; (1956), he appeared alongside John Mills. The following year, he played the title character in a BBC Television five part Sunday serial &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; and then with Keith Michell and Belinda Lee in the opulent swashbuckler, &quot;Dangerous Exile&quot;, playing Louis XVII, the ten-year-old son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Also during that period, he featured in two episodes of Sapphire Films&#x27; &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1957) alongside Richard Greene, one role being that of Will Dale in the episode &quot;The Challenge of the Black Knight&quot;. In the &quot;Sword of Freedom&quot; series (1957), also made by Sapphire, he played Alberto in the episode &quot;Chart of Gold&quot;. In an early &quot;Carry On&quot; film, &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot; (1959), he had the small role of student Robin Stevens. Around the same time, he was cast in the role of Pierre van der Mal in an early scene of &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (also 1959), playing the younger brother of Gabrielle (Audrey Hepburn). Also around that time, he had a leading role in an episode of the Sapphire/ITC series &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (&quot;The Man with the Golden Touch&quot;, 1959), as Neapolitan street urchin Pietro, who foils a robbery.

==Adult acting career==
In the early 1960s, O&#x27;Sullivan appeared in two Cliff Richard films: &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1961), and &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1964). In the 1963 blockbuster &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, he appeared as Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII, the younger brother of the title character played by Elizabeth Taylor.

For the remainder of the 1960s, O&#x27;Sullivan was a jobbing actor appearing in such TV series as &quot;Dr Syn: the Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;Emergency Ward 10&quot;, &quot;Redcap&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; and &quot;Strange Report&quot; among others, until he was offered the role of Lawrence Bingham in the LWT sitcom &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1971), a role which continued in the later &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot; (1972–73). Meanwhile, he also had a main role in the Thames Television comedy &quot;Alcock and Gander&quot; (1972) with Beryl Reid.

By then a regular in TV sitcoms, he starred as Robin Tripp, a trainee chef, in the flatshare sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot; written by Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, launched in 1973.

In 1975, he starred in the stage comedy &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot;, undertaking two record-breaking national tours, alongside two of his &quot;Man About The House&quot; co-stars, Yootha Joyce and Sally Thomsett.

When &quot;Man About the House&quot; ended in 1976, he continued playing Robin Tripp in the spin-off sitcom &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in which Robin sets up a bistro with funding from his girlfriend Vicky&#x27;s father, James Nicholls (Tony Britton). During his run as Robin, he had relationships with two of his co-stars, Sally Thomsett from &quot;Man About the House&quot;, and Tessa Wyatt, who played Vicky in &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;. From the latter relationship, he had a son, Jamie.

&quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot; was a big success, and was the first UK sitcom to feature an unmarried couple cohabiting. To tie in with the series, O&#x27;Sullivan wrote a recipe book called &quot;Man About the Kitchen&quot;, and a sequel &quot;Roastin’ with Richard&quot; which were published in 1980. He also wrote the &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot; theme tune, which was arranged by Brian Bennett. During that period, O&#x27;Sullivan also appeared in adverts for British Gas.

In 1979, he starred in the title role of LWT&#x27;s drama series &quot;Dick Turpin&quot;, which ran until 1982. He then played the widower Simon Harrup in the sitcom &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, broadcast from 1984 to 1988, co-starring Tim Brooke-Taylor and Joan Sanderson, also produced by LWT. He also appeared in a one-off comedy-drama &quot;The Giftie&quot;, shown on Channel Four in 1988, in which he and a friend discovered a photocopier at work that could duplicate living copies of themselves, unwisely doing so, and predictably leading to mistaken identities and chaos. In the 1990s, his profile decreased although he was never short of work. His final acting role was in a 1996 one-off satire titled &quot;Holed&quot;, with Tony Robinson, about a suburban golf club.

==Later life==
O&#x27;Sullivan largely retired from public life in 1996. His last appearance on television was as a guest on a 1999 edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; held in honour of his &quot;Doctor...&quot; co-star George Layton. O&#x27;Sullivan had himself been the subject of the show in 1974. In 2006, O&#x27;Sullivan recorded a commentary for the DVD release of &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot;.

He has lived in Brinsworth House, a retirement home for entertainers in Twickenham, since suffering a stroke in 2003.

<text>The Mar-Keys, formed in 1958, were an American studio session band for Stax Records, in Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.

==Career==
===Early success with &quot;Last Night&quot; (1961)===
The group began as the Royal Spades while its members were in high school. They tried to get a record made for the local Satellite Records (the forerunner of Stax), unsuccessfully, even though the label was owned by the mother and uncle of the group&#x27;s tenor sax player, Charles &quot;Packy&quot; Axton. When the band eventually made a record, Axton&#x27;s mother, Estelle Axton, convinced them to change their name, and they became &quot;The Mar-Keys&quot;. However, the live lineup of the Mar-Keys was not always the same as the band heard on the recordings.

Their first and most famous recording was the organ- and saxophone-driven single &quot;Last Night&quot;, a number three hit nationally in the US in 1961. It sold over one million copies, earning certification as a gold disc. The lineup for this recording included the Royal Spades&#x27; Steve Cropper (normally a guitarist, here playing second keyboard; producer Chips Moman did not want a guitar part on the song), Packy Axton (tenor sax), Wayne Jackson (trumpet), and Jerry Lee &quot;Smoochy&quot; Smith (main keyboards), augmented by horn players Floyd Newman (baritone sax), Gilbert Caple (tenor sax) and others. The authorship of the song, credited simply to &quot;Mar-Keys&quot; on the label, is registered with BMI to Axton, Caple, Newman, Smith, and producer Moman.

===Follow-ups and fragmentation (1961–1966)===
Singles and albums continued to appear under the Mar-Keys name throughout the 1960s, though none anywhere near as successful as &quot;Last Night&quot;. The original all-white band continued to play live dates for a time, but fairly quickly, were largely replaced for studio recordings by session players. This meant that in practice, &quot;The Mar-Keys&quot; became a &quot;de facto&quot; name for the racially integrated Stax Records house band, which had a floating membership. The most frequent Mar-Keys studio players during this era, subject to change from session to session, were:

*Guitar: Steve Cropper
*Bass: Duck Dunn, or occasionally Lewie Steinberg (until 1964).
*Keyboards: Smoochy Smith (occasionally through 1963) and/or Marvell Thomas (frequently through 1963); essentially supplanted by Booker T. Jones (with increasing frequency from 1962) and/or Isaac Hayes (after mid-1964). 
*Drums: Howard Grimes (1961–62) or Terry Johnson (occasionally, 1961–62); supplanted by Al Jackson Jr. (from mid-1962).
*Horns: varying combinations of Wayne Jackson, Floyd Newman, Don Nix, Gilbert Caple, Vinny Trauth (through 1963), Packy Axton (through 1964), Andrew Love (from 1964).

These musicians, in addition to being the studio Mar-Keys, served as the backing band on singles and albums by dozens of rock, R&amp;B, and soul music artists who recorded at the Stax studios, including Otis Redding, Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett, and many others.
While still involved with the Mar-Keys and Stax studio work, Cropper, Steinberg, Jones and Al Jackson Jr. also began recording as Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s in 1962. Consequently, from then through 1966 instrumental music recorded by the Stax house band was issued under the name of either the Mar-Keys or Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, depending on the type of recording: in general, tracks featuring a horn section were credited to the Mar-Keys, and those without horns were credited to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s.

Dunn replaced Steinberg in the M.G.&#x27;s in 1964, having already played with the Mar-Keys both live and in the studio for several years.

The demise of the group as a singles act occurred due to the success of several of its members. By the time of the 1965 recording &quot;Boot-Leg&quot;, singles credited to Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were far outselling recordings credited to the Mar-Keys, who had failed to chart in years. Therefore, the decision was made to issue the horn-driven &quot;Boot-Leg&quot; (co-written with Packy Axton and Isaac Hayes) as a track by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, even though it had been conceived of as a Mar-Keys track, and Booker T. Jones himself did not actually play on it.

With the top 40 chart success of &quot;Boot-Leg&quot;, by the end of 1966 the Mar-Keys name was no longer appearing on singles.

===The six-man line-up (1967–1969)===
Although the Mar-Keys were no longer routinely issuing singles, the name still had a certain amount of marketability, and in the late 1960s the Mar-Keys name was used whenever horn players Andrew Love and Wayne Jackson (later known as the Memphis Horns) teamed with Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s in live performances. The two groups shared billing on a live album in 1967, &quot;Back to Back&quot;, from a concert in Paris.

For the 1969 album &quot;Damifiknow!&quot;, the Mar-Keys were back in the studio, and were explicitly identified in the album credits as the sextet of Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Booker T. Jones, Al Jackson, Andrew Love, and Wayne Jackson (no relation to Al). The album was not a chart success, and the Mar-Keys name was essentially retired once again.

===Final years (1970–1971)===
For the final album credited to the Mar-Keys, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Memphis Experience&quot; Stax simply assembled a number of instrumental cuts from various sources, without regard for group continuity. Three of the album&#x27;s seven cuts were outtakes from sessions by the Bar-Kays, while the other cuts were performed by various uncredited Memphis musicians with no other ties to the Mar-Keys&#x27; past.

===Legacy and later activity===
The legacy of the Mar-Keys is that they were key players in the development of Southern soul and Memphis soul.

In 2012, the Mar-Keys regrouped with a lineup consisting of original members Wayne Jackson, Floyd Newman, Don Nix, Smoochy Smith, Terry Johnson, plus former M.G. Lewie Steinberg, and original member Packy Axton&#x27;s son Chuck.

Terry Johnson (born James Terry Johnson on April 3, 1943, in Memphis, Tennessee) died on March 19, 2016, after a short illness, at age 72.

<text>Luo Lin (; born 22 June 1971), known professionally as Dao Lang (), is a Chinese singer from Sichuan.

==Biography==
Dao&#x27;s CD, &quot;The First Snows of 2002&quot; (2002年的第一場雪), released in 2003, made him an instant star in China. He sang with Alan Tam on the debut &quot;Can&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; (說不出的告別) in the Cantonese version and later, bilingual between Mandarin and Cantonese. His other albums include 2001&#x27;s &quot;Songs from the Western Region&quot; .

Dao toured the Chinese cities of Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi&#x27;an, as well as the autonomous region of Tibet, for more than four years as a young bar-hopping musician. He has been called the &quot;Wang Luobin of the 21st century&quot; and has performed modern rock adaptations of several of Wang Luobin&#x27;s Western China-inspired folk songs, such as &quot;Awariguli&quot; (a Xinjiang Uyghur folk love song), &quot;Flowers and Youth&quot; (a Hui Muslim song), and &quot;At a Faraway Place&quot; (a song from western China&#x27;s Qinghai). He has also performed modern adaptations of such renowned old Chinese folk songs as &quot;The Grapes of Turpan are Ripe&quot; and the famous revolutionary song &quot;Nanniwan&quot;.

Dao experienced a surge of popularity in 2023 with the release of his album &quot;There Are a Few Folk Songs&quot; (山歌寥哉), based on the work of Pu Songling. In particular, his satirical song &quot;Luochahai City&quot; or Luosha Kingdom (罗刹海市) went viral. The song is based from &quot;The Raksha Country and the Sea Market&quot;.

==Awards==
Dao was considered by the Beijing Music Society in 2002 as the &quot;Best Pop Singer&quot; and &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;. The only other young artists that had received this honor were Cui Jian in 1987 and Huang Yujie in 2008.

The modified signal triggers a process similar to a buffer overflow in a human brain, rewriting the victim&#x27;s DNA and turning it into a copy of the alien attacker. A very similar theme was used independently by David Langford in the short story &quot;BLIT&quot;. The invasion is thwarted with the help of a blind stunt driver trained to shoot on sound, who, to add to the conflict, happens to be a pacifist.

The inventor tests the device on his friends&#x27; aquarium, causing much distress and anger because the apparatus shows the aquarium fish dreaming about killing and eating the humans, and dominating the world; as a consequence, all humans who saw the experiment feel they will never be able to trust any pet animal again.
** &quot;Strom&quot; (&quot;The Tree&quot;) – a vision of a society after a near-miss ecological catastrophe, which was avoided only thanks to draconian laws of environment protection that put the nature and its preservation well above human life.

<doc id="1171321" wikidata="Q935579" url="?curid=1171321" title="Faruq al-Qaddumi">
<text>Faruq al-Qaddumi or Farouk al-Kaddoumi (; 18 August 1931 – 22 August 2024), also known by the kunya Abu al-Lutf (), was a Palestinian politician, who served as the Secretary-General of Fatah until 2009 and Chairman of Fatah&#x27;s central committee and the Palestine Liberation Organization&#x27;s political department, operating from Tunisia, between 2004 and 2009.

==Early life==
Faruq al-Qaddumi was born on 18 August 1931, in the town of Jinsafut near Nablus in Mandatory Palestine and later his family moved to Jaffa. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and Nakba they fled to Nablus in the West Bank. In the early 1950s al-Qaddumi worked in Saudi Arabia for the Arab-American Petroleum Company (ARAMCO). In 1954 he moved to Egypt and studied economy and political science at the American University in Cairo. While in Egypt, he joined the Baath party.

==Fatah career==
In 1958, al-Qaddumi joined Yasser Arafat who was organizing student groups calling for the liberation of Palestine. Fatah, the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, was established at the beginning of 1965. At the time, al-Qaddumi worked for the Ministry of Health of Kuwait. In 1966, he was expelled from the country for political activities connected with the PLO. By 1969 he was one of key figures in the PLO. From 1973 he headed its political department in Beirut, Lebanon.

At the beginning of 1973, al-Qaddumi was appointed head of the PLO&#x27;s political department. In 1976, Arafat and al-Qaddumi met with Meir Vilner and Tawfik Toubi, heads of Rakah (New Communist List), established after the 1965 split in the Israeli Communist Party, and from which Hadash developed. Since the early 1980s Al-Qaddumi had been living in Tunis where the PLO was based after expulsion from Lebanon. 

In 1985, when four Palestine Liberation Front militants hijacked the MS Achille Lauro and killed Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound Jewish-American, al-Qaddumi claimed that Klinghoffer was pushed over the side of the ship by his wife for the insurance money.

After the Oslo Accords in 1993, which he opposed as a betrayal of the PLO&#x27;s principles, al-Qaddumi refused to move to the Palestinian Territories with the rest of the leadership to set up the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). From exile, he continued to advocate a hardline stance towards Israel, refused cooperation with the PNA and repeatedly disagreed with the PLO during negotiations with Israel by making statements denying recognition of Israel. This led to him being sidelined in Palestinian politics for over a decade, as the center of power moved to Gaza and then Ramallah.

== Personal Life and Legacy ==
Farouk al-Qaddumi, known for his significant role in the Palestinian political landscape, became a central figure in the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and served as the head of its political department for many years. He was instrumental in shaping the PLO’s policies and was a close confidant of Yasser Arafat.

His diplomatic efforts extended beyond the Arab world, as he sought to garner international support for the Palestinian cause.

Even after stepping back from his active role in politics, al-Qaddumi remained a respected figure within the Palestinian community.

==PLO power struggle==
Upon Arafat&#x27;s death, al-Qaddumi constitutionally succeeded him to the position of Fatah chairman. Finding himself once again in a position of power, he began wrestling for control of the ideologically diverse movement, and of the PLO, pitted against PLO chairman and PNA president Mahmoud Abbas. Mud-slinging between the factions was intense, with al-Qaddumi trying to claim primacy for the PLO (which formally delegates power to the PNA). Among other things, al-Qaddumi denied that the PNA had a right to call its government members &quot;ministers&quot; or open embassies abroad. 

While most of the struggle was carried out behind the scenes, the Palestinian Authority – then still in control of the Gaza Strip – suppressed an attempt by al-Qaddumi to organize an armed militia outside of the Authority&#x27;s control in the Strip. Al-Qaddumi issued a decree to expel all Fatah members who cooperated with the PNA, but this was declared unlawful by Fatah&#x27;s central committee, along with his styling himself &quot;president&quot; of the movement.

As head of the PLO&#x27;s political department, al-Qaddumi had primary responsibility for foreign representation. However, the PLO embassies were reorganized by Abbas and PNA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, who removed al-Qaddumi loyalists from ambassadorial posts. Abbas redirected foreign contacts to pass through the PNA&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Al-Qidwa, and later Ziad Abu Amr and Riad Al-Maliki, which infuriated al-Qaddumi.

The 6th Fatah conference was held in Bethlehem in August 2009. Holding the conference in the occupied territories came as a disappointment to many exiled Fatah leaders who were unable to attend and felt betrayed by this decision; al-Qaddumi being one of them. A few weeks before the conference, al-Qaddumi accused Abbas of conspiring to kill Yasser Arafat and claimed he had evidence for his involvement in a plot to poison Arafat. Abbas and his aides denied those allegations and accused al-Qaddumi of inflaming fitna (divisions, internal strife).

While Abbas was the stronger player in this power struggle, members of the Abbas faction worried that al-Qaddumi&#x27;s militant attitude would win over radical segments of the Fatah, or he would ally with hardline forces outside the movement, such as Hamas. Al-Qaddumi made many official visits to the Assad regime in Damascus, where he was presented in the Syrian press as representing the Palestinian movement.

==Family==
Al-Qaddoumi had two sons: Lutof, his eldest, who was often referred to as Abu Lutof, and his second son, Rami. Both sons grew up with the values and traditions passed down from their father. Al-Qaddoumi’s influence extended beyond his immediate family, as his legacy carried on through his four grandchildren, who were a testament to his enduring impact on future generations especially his youngest. Farouq&#x27;s legacy, shaped by his wisdom and guidance, played a significant role in nurturing his children and grandchildren, ensuring that his values and teachings would live on for years to come.

==Death==
Al-Qaddumi died in Amman, Jordan on 22 August 2024, at the age of 93. He was with his family at his final moments and died peacefully.

==Views and opinions==
* &quot;At this stage there will be two states. Many years from now there will be only one.&quot; (al-Qaddumi),
* &quot;Resistance is the path to arriving at a political settlement&quot;
* &quot;We shall never allow Israel to live in peace… We shall never recognize Israel, never accept the usurper, the colonialist, the imperialist.&quot;

<text>Roland Robinson (1949, Detroit, Michigan – November 8, 2004, Memphis, Tennessee) was a longtime Memphis studio session bass player and songwriter. Robinson was a cousin and close friend of Teenie Hodges, Al Green&#x27;s lead guitarist in the 1970s when Green recorded with the famed Hi Records staff band, the Hi Rhythm Section.

Robinson played for several years with Stax stars like Eddie Floyd and once jammed with Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Miles Express&#x27; guitarist Jim McCarty and Jimi Hendrix&#x27; drummer Mitch Mitchell, a heavily edited recording of which was released as &#x27;Jimi/Jimmy Jam&#x27; on the posthumous compilation Jimi Hendrix album &quot;Nine to the Universe&quot; which features other heavily edited, disparate studio jams with widely varying personnel, recorded over the span of six months during 1969, that producer Alan Douglas (although not involved in the original recordings, but was himself a jazz producer from the early sixties, and also a compiler, and editor of other posthumous compilation releases of some note.) considered exemplified Hendrix&#x27; jazz leanings. 
He regularly performed and recorded on albums for a few years with the late rock and funk drummer Buddy Miles, who had previously played with Mike Bloomfield and Jimi Hendrix, (although not the same one as Robinson and was recorded two months later), prior to developing a solo career.

He worked as a songwriter and performer in 1973 in a group called The New Cactus Band with Duane Hitchings (an original member of Buddy Miles Express, who was also recorded jamming with Hendrix (but quite sporadically, over at least two years), although, (unlike Robinson) he was edited out of the only official release of his jams by Alan Douglas, and this &quot;fame&quot; has to rely on the untampered, bootlegs of the original recordings), the sole member from the final lineup of the Cactus band, which had disbanded in 1972. They released one album on Atco, disbanding shortly thereafter. His rock and roll band Quo Jr. (&quot;The Son Of What&#x27;s Happening&quot;), composed of veteran R&amp;B players including The New Cactus Band drummer Jerry Norris, opened one show for the Sex Pistols&#x27; notorious first U.S. tour at the Taliesyn Ballroom in Memphis in 1978, performing regularly for several years into the 1980s. Hitchings and Robinson, who also worked together in a group called Steel, later collaborated to write Rod Stewart&#x27;s 1984 hit song, &quot;Infatuation.&quot; Robinson recorded with The Mar-Keys and blues great Willie Cobbs, among others.

<text>The Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway is a heritage railway operated by the Rushden Historical Transport Society in the town of Rushden in the county of Northamptonshire, England.

The aim of the society was to reopen most of the former Midland Railway branch line from Wellingborough to Higham Ferrers, which had been closed completely in November 1969. As of April 2016, around stretch of the line is operated between Rushden station and Prospect Avenue. The society plans to extend the line to a halt at Higham Ferrers. They are unable to extend back towards Wellingborough due to developments that have taken place along the route of the old branch line.

==Rushden station==

Rushden station has been preserved by the Rushden Historical Transport Society. The station building is fully intact and open with no admission fee although donations are requested.

The footbridge is currently missing, and a level crossing divides the platform into two sections. A replacement footbridge similar to the original is awaiting installation, at which point the missing section of platform will be replaced.

On operating days trains use a separate platform slightly to the east. There is a signal box on site also. To the west immediately after the station there is a bridge missing. To the east, the line ends adjacent to Prospect Ave, and is used throughout the year.

Since the late 1990s, Rushden Station bar has been home to a series of resident cats. The most recent station cats, Alfie and Thomas, have achieved minor fame on social media.

=== Rolling stock ===

On site can be found a main-line diesel, Class 31, 31206, a number of Mark 1 carriages and a Gresley buffet car. In addition the line has a few industrial steam locomotives and some small diesel shunters. Frequently a number of preserved buses and coaches can also be found on the site.

<doc id="1171399" wikidata="Q1089129" url="?curid=1171399" title="Guianan trogon">
<text>The Guianan trogon (Trogon violaceus), is a near passerine bird in the trogon and quetzal family Trogonidae. It is found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad, and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Guianan trogon was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other trogons in the genus &quot;Trogon&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Trogon violaceus&quot;. Gmelin based his account on a description and illustration by the German botanist Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter that had been published 1765. Gmelin did not specify a type locality, but this has been designated as Suriname. The specific epithet &quot;violaceus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;violet-coloured&quot;. The species is now considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The Guianan trogon was formerly named the violaceous trogon and included the gartered trogon (&quot;T. caligatus&quot;) and the Amazonian trogon (&quot;T. ramonianus&quot;) as subspecies. A molecular phylogenetic study of the genus &quot;Trogon&quot; based on a single mitochondrial gene was published in 2008. It found that the Guianan trogon, the blue-crowned trogon (&quot;T. curucui&quot;) and the Surucua trogon (&quot;T. surrucura&quot;) formed a well defined clade but the three Guianan trogon subspecies did not form a monophyletic group.

The Guianan trogon is treated as a monotypic species by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (SACC), the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), and the Clements taxonomy. BirdLife International&#x27;s Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) treats it as the nominate subspecies of violaceous trogon. HBW also includes five other subspecies that the SACC, IOC, and Clements treat as members of two full species, gartered trogon (&quot;T. caligatus&quot;) and Amazonian trogon (&quot;T. ramonianus&quot;). The SACC notes that the split into three species might deserve reevaluation.

==Description==

The Guianan trogon is long and weighs . Males and females have very different plumage. Adult males have a violet-blue head with a black mask and throat; their bill is pale blue-gray and their dark eye is surrounded by bare pale yellow skin. The violet-blue of their head extends to the middle of their breast, where a narrow white band separates it from the bright yellow of the rest of their underparts. Their upperparts are bright metallic green and their wings so finely marked with black and white that they appear dark gray-brown. Their tail&#x27;s upper surface is violet-blue with black tips to the feathers; the lower surface has fine black and white bars and wide white tips to the feathers. Adult females&#x27; bills have a blackish culmen and the face has white arcs above and below the eye. Their head and upperparts are dark gray and their wings are thinly but densely barred black and white. Their belly is a duller yellow than the male&#x27;s and has a gray wash on the flanks. The underside of their tail appears barred on its sides. Juvenile males have browner wings and less white on their undertail than adults. Juvenile females are like the adult.

The Guinan trogon&#x27;s song is &quot;a long series of rapid hollow downslurred whistles, &quot;kyu-kyu-kyu-kyu-kyu-kyu&quot;&quot;. Its calls include &quot;rolling chattering.&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==

The Guianan trogon is non-migratory. It is found in eastern Venezuela, the Guianas, and adjacent northern Brazil. It inhabits a variety of semi-open landscapes such as savanna, the edges and openings of primary forest, young secondary forest, cacao and coffee plantations, and &quot;terra firme&quot; forest. It ranges as high as in Venezuela.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===
The Guianan trogon&#x27;s diet is fruit and arthropods that it collects while hovering after short sallies from a perch. It often joins mixed-species foraging flocks.

===Breeding===
The Guianan trogon&#x27;s breeding season is not fully defined but appears to be within the November to June period. It excavates a cavity in arboreal nests of paper wasps, ants, or termites and also in rotten wood or a fern root mass. The clutch size is two or three eggs. The incubation time is not known; fledging occurs at least 17 days after hatch.

==Status==

The IUCN follows HBW taxonomy and so has not assessed the Guianan trogon separately from the violaceous trogon &quot;sensu lato&quot;. The species is &quot;[r]are and local in Venezuela, but common in Trinidad and Suriname.&quot;

<doc id="1171400" wikidata="Q6256481" url="?curid=1171400" title="John Safran vs God">
<text>John Safran vs God is an eight-part television documentary series by John Safran which was broadcast on SBS TV of Australia in 2004. It has been described in a media release as &quot;John Safran&#x27;s most audacious project yet&quot;. It had a much more serious tone than Safran&#x27;s previous work &quot;Music Jamboree&quot;. The show was released by Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions and SBS Independent, was co-written with Mark O&#x27;Toole, directed by Craig Melville, and produced by Richard Lowenstein, Selin Yaman, and Ghost Pictures. The production team was known as Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions, an amalgamation of John Safran&#x27;s Ex-Boyfriend Productions, and Richard Lowenstein&#x27;s Ghost Productions. The series won the 2005 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Comedy Series.

The show&#x27;s opening theme is &quot;Hate Priest&quot; by the band Mozart on Crack. The opening sequence features John in a black suit breaking out of a patch of black scorched earth with his bare hands during a thunderstorm. The words of Revelation 20:7, &quot;when the thousand years are over Satan will be released from his prison&quot;, are spoken in a low pseudo-ominous voice.

== Episode guide == 

=== Episode one ===
* In the UK, Safran meets Sheikh Omar Bakri and Sheikh Abu Hamza and succeeds in getting a fatwa placed on Rove McManus for dropping John&#x27;s scheduled appearance on &quot;Rove Live&quot;. The fatwa was later removed from McManus.
* Safran tries out a religion based on the hallucinogenic cactus plant Peyote; vomiting and weak hallucinations ensue.
* Safran examines Scientology at the expense of Jamie Packer and the Nine Network.

=== Episode two ===
* Safran looks at the duplicity of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sorry&quot; attitude to Indigenous Rights
* Safran tries out zen Buddhism in Japan, the segment includes two incidents of Safran being beaten with a stick as punishment for mistakes made with meditation and philosophical questions
* Safran examines the link between Satanism and Freemasonry

=== Episode three ===
* Despite being Jewish, Safran attempts to join a branch of the Ku Klux Klan in California
* Safran tries out Catholicism under the guidance of Father Bob Maguire
* Safran holds a competition in which Australian-Palestinians vie for his Israeli citizenship by recreating segments from &quot;Music Jamboree&quot;

=== Episode four ===
* Safran examines Mormon cinema in Salt Lake City, proposing his &quot;Extreme Mormons&quot; film
* Safran tries out Vodou in Haiti, participating in the &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; ceremony
* John visits a Jewish gun advocate and rabbi in Los Angeles, in a bid to show that American gun rights activists consist of more than fundamentalist Christians

The Vodou segment was graphic, featuring the TV crew being attacked, spiritual possession, and a goat having its testicles bitten off and its throat slit.

=== Episode five ===
* John travels to Sicily to confess to a priest that he stole some batteries and masturbated in a bed owned by the priest during &quot;Race Around the World&quot;
* Again in Salt Lake City, Safran tries some atheistic door knocking to harass local Mormons
* In India, Safran tries out the spiritual teachings of several Hindu gurus

=== Episode six ===
* John auditions for the Harlem Gospel Choir with a tuneless rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;
* John tries out Ásatrú (&quot;the Viking religion&quot;) taking part in a remembrance ceremony in the United States
* &quot;Big Brother&quot; series one contestant Sara-Marie Fedele helps Safran attempt to broker peace between Australian representatives of both sides of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
* Inspired by rumours in Malawi John confronts Australian politicians in Canberra to try and discover if any are vampires

The only politician who was found to be a so-called &quot;vampire&quot; was Kevin Rudd who would later become Prime Minister.

=== Episode seven ===
* John travels to Mozambique to lift a curse from the Socceroos at the behest of football legend Johnny Warren
* Again in Salt Lake City, Safran finds out what is so special about &quot;Mormon underwear&quot;
* With the help of Canberra mathematician Brendan McKay, John uncovers the link between &quot;The Bible Code&quot;, the September 11 attacks, and rapper Vanilla Ice
* John examines the realistic goals of religious boycotts

=== Episode eight ===
The eighth episode was the most controversial. Instead of its usual format of various segments, the show featured a single story: the exorcism of John&#x27;s demons by Christian exorcist and fundamentalist preacher Bob Larson. There was none of the humour that characterised the preceding episodes. The exorcism was dramatic and realistic and no explanation was given at the end of the episode as to John&#x27;s behaviour. On the Yahoo! &quot;Cult of Safran&quot; web group a stormy discussion started on whether John was actually faking - Safran&#x27;s lisp is absent while allegedly possessed. Safran appeared in several radio and television plug spots for the show post-production/pre-screening and only briefly commented on the exorcism episode as a very intense segment to film. After the screening of the episode, Safran appeared in an interview on ABC radio and said he didn&#x27;t remember a lot of the experience. The sales pitch for the DVD is &quot;you&#x27;ve seen the exorcism, now buy the DVD&quot;.

<doc id="1171408" wikidata="Q3194071" url="?curid=1171408" title="Kathleen Harrison">
<text>Kathleen Harrison (23 February 1892 – 7 December 1995) was a prolific English character actress best remembered for her role as Mrs. Huggett (opposite Jack Warner and Petula Clark) in a trio of British post-war comedies about a working-class family&#x27;s misadventures, The Huggetts. She later played the charwoman Mrs. Dilber opposite Alastair Sim in the 1951 film &quot;Scrooge&quot; (US: &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, 1951) and a Cockney charwoman who inherits a fortune in the television series &quot;Mrs Thursday&quot; (1966–67).

==Life and career==
Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Harrison was brought up in London, her father having become borough engineer for Southwark. She was educated at Clapham High School before training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1914–15). She spent some years living in Argentina and Madeira before making her professional acting debut in the UK in the 1920s.

Harrison made her stage debut as Mrs. Judd in &quot;The Constant Flirt&quot; at the Pier Theatre, Eastbourne in 1926. The following year she appeared in London&#x27;s West End for the first time as Winnie in &quot;The Cage&quot; at the Savoy Theatre. Her subsequent West End plays included &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;, &quot;Happy Families&quot;, &quot;The Merchant and Venus&quot;, &quot;Lovers&#x27; Meeting&quot;, &quot;Line Engaged&quot;, &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;—also acting in the 1937 film version—&quot;Flare Path&quot;, &quot;Ducks and Drakes&quot;, &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; and &quot;Watch It Sailor!&quot;.

She had already made her film debut with a minor role in &quot;Our Boys&quot; (1915), when she appeared in the film &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1931). Another 50 films followed, including &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942) and &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945), before making her name in later films.

Before and during World War II, she played small parts in numerous British films, including &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; (1941), &quot;Temptation Harbour&quot; (1947), and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), and had a small but scene-stealing role as Mrs. Dilber in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (US: &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, 1951).

Harrison also played Kaney in &quot;The Ghoul&quot; (1933) and the matriarch in &quot;Mrs. Gibbons&#x27; Boys&quot; (1962), as well as two BBC productions of Charles Dickens&#x27;s novels, &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1964) and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1976). She later commented that Dickens was her favourite author. As her cinema appearances became more infrequent, Harrison turned to television. She starred on television as &quot;Mrs Thursday&quot; (1966–67), a charwoman who inherits £10 million and the controlling interest in a major company.

===The Huggett family===

The Huggett family made their first appearance in &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; (1947). Harrison played the London East End charwoman Mrs Huggett. The actress continued with the role, alongside Jack Warner as her screen husband, in &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (1948), &quot;Vote for Huggett&quot; and &quot;The Huggetts Abroad&quot; (both 1949), as well as a radio series, &quot;Meet the Huggetts&quot;, which ran from 1953 to 1961. Although disliked by critics, almost immediately it became one of the most popular programmes of its day. Harrison turned down the title role in writer Jeremy Sandford&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; &quot;Edna, the Inebriate Woman&quot; (1971).

Harrison also starred with Warner in the film &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1956), about a working-class family that wins the football pools.

==Personal life==
Harrison married John Henry Back in 1916; the couple had three children, two sons, and a daughter. She always pretended to be six years younger than her age, but in 1992 she owned up to reaching 100 and received her telegram from the Queen. Harrison died in 1995 at the age of 103. She was predeceased by her husband, John, and a son.

<text>Rutland Railway Museum, now trading as Rocks by Rail: The Living Ironstone Museum, is a heritage railway on part of a former Midland Railway mineral branch line. It is situated north east of Oakham, in Rutland, England.

==Overview==
The museum offers an open-air site dedicated to recreating an ironstone tramway system in its entirety from the extraction of iron ore from a &#x27;first cut&#x27; quarry face reproduced in the quarry viewing area to the exchange sidings with the BR rail head. The museum aims to preserve and operate industrial locomotives and mineral wagons from local quarry railways as well as artefacts related to quarry railways in general.

The museum site is based on a typical 1950s or early 1960s quarry system when both steam and diesel power was evident in the industry. The branch line linked to the Melton Mowbray to Oakham main line at Ashwell Signal Box. Exchange sidings were once located at the museum serving three separate private quarry railway systems associated with the past extraction of iron ore. The museum site was known locally as Cottesmore Iron Ore Mines Sidings.

The concrete tipping dock built for Cottesmore quarries has been conserved, along with the locomotive running shed from Woolsthorpe Quarries on the Lincs/Leics border, in its entirety. Also preserved are several items of quarry machinery including a 22RB Ruston-Bucyrus face shovel, a 22RB Ruston-Bucyrus dragline excavator and a Euclid dump truck as used in local quarry systems. The cab of the massive Ransomes &amp; Rapier dragline excavator Sundew is on display along with a cab from 110RB Ruston-Bucyrus dragline from the Barrington Cement Works quarry railway.

Also present at the museum is the Simon Layfield Exhibition Centre which comprises three roads of locomotive/wagon exhibits and related displays concerning former local quarry railways.

Also on display at the museum is Hawthorn Leslie locomotive &quot;SINGAPORE&quot; works number 3865 built in 1936. This locomotive was exported to Singapore Royal Navy Dockyard and was captured in February 1942 by the Japanese during World War II. The locomotive features superficial bullet and shrapnel damage sustained during air raids on the dockyard from Japanese aircraft. The locomotive HL3865/36 &quot;SINGAPORE&quot; is an honorary member of the FEPOW organisation and a registered War Memorial.

The museum operates passenger rides on a length of track and occupies an area of nearly 9 acres (28,000 m2). Passenger rides are provided in restored brake vans, typical of those formerly used in freight trains in the area. The museum welcomes any related donations of artefacts or information which may help further its aims.

<doc id="1171412" wikidata="Q3547080" url="?curid=1171412" title="Ivatan language">
<text>The Ivatan language, also known as Chirin nu Ivatan (&quot;language of the Ivatan people&quot;), is an Austronesian language spoken in the Batanes Islands of the Philippines.

Although the islands are closer to Taiwan than to Luzon, it is not one of the Formosan languages. Ivatan is one of the Batanic languages, which are perhaps a primary branch of the Malayo-Polynesian family of Austronesian languages.

The language of Babuyan Island (Ibatan) is sometimes classified as a dialect of the Ivatan language. Most of the Babuyan population moved to Batan Island and to Luzon mainland during the Spanish colonial period. The island became repopulated at the end of the 19th century with families from Batan, most of them speakers of one of the Ivatan dialects.

Ivatan speakers are found outside their homeland, many of them settled in mainland Luzon particularly in nearby Cagayan Valley, Ilocandia, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Mindoro and Palawan and also settled as far as Mindanao. In Mindanao, a significant Ivatan-speaking minority exist mainly in Bukidnon, Lanao and Cotabato where they settled since the 1950s in search of economic opportunities settled down in government homesteads in these areas. Nowadays, however, their language has becoming endangered among Ivatan settlers&#x27; descendants especially newer generations born in Mindanao, due to being accustomed into a society of Cebuano-speaking majority. Like elsewhere, intermarriage between Ivatans and Mindanaoans of various ethnicities are not uncommon. Most of these Ivatans in Mindanao today speak the majority language of Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Tagalog and other Mindanao indigenous languages more than their ancestors&#x27; native language in varying fluency or none at all.

== Introduction ==
Ivatan is especially characterized by its words, which mostly have the letter &quot;v&quot;, as in , , and . While related to the Northern Philippine group of languages, Ivatan, having been isolated, is most close to the two other members of the Bashiic sub-group of languages, Yami (Tao) and Itbayat, neither of which is indigenous to Luzon. Ibatan dialect, spoken on the nearby Babuyan group of islands, is so similar to Ivatan that it is not entirely clear whether it should be classified as a dialect of Ivatan or a separate language, though each does receive its own code in ISO taxonomy.

Ivatan has two dialects; Basco Ivatan, more commonly known as Ivasay, spoken on the main island of Batan, and Southern Ivatan or Isamurung, spoken on the southern half of Batan and on the most southern island, Sabtang.

==Variations in language==

In the capital of Basco and the surrounding northern half of Batan, the area encompassed by Ivasayen, &quot;t&quot; is prominent, whereas in the Isamurongen zone to the south (Mahatao, Ivana, Uyugan and Sabtang) that phoneme becomes a &quot;ch&quot;.

Examples of the more visible variations of the Ivasayen and Isamurongen words and pronunciations are:
* (&#x27;to look&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns
* (&#x27;later&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns
* (&#x27;patola&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns
* (&#x27;rain&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns

Itbayaten is sometimes also considered a dialect. 2% of the total vocabulary does not occur in Ivatan dialects. Examples of different Ivasayen, Isamurongen and Itbayaten words that have the same English translation:
* (&#x27;to kiss&#x27;) in Basco and the southern towns is in Itbayat.
* (&#x27;none&#x27;) in Basco and the southern towns is in Itbayat.
* (&#x27;pig&#x27;) in Basco and the southern towns is in Itbayat.
* (&#x27;nest&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns and in Itbayat.
* (&#x27;tail&#x27;) in Basco is in the southern towns and also in Itbayat.

Ivatan and Filipino words are sometimes combined, as in the Ivatan word . It is derived from (Filipino) and (Ivatan), literally &#x27;someone who knows&#x27;, which were then compounded to form the word . This is the result of the influence of non-Ivatans who tend to speak the language and were then eventually adopted.

Examples of metathesis in Ivatan include for (&#x27;stairs&#x27;) and for (&#x27;going up&#x27;).

Ivatan slang includes examples such as , coined from – literally &#x27;we’ll meet again later&#x27;, and , coined from , literally &#x27;where are you going&#x27;. These are results of shortening Ivatan phrases or sentences into one or two words, depending on usage.

Common Ivatan expressions have various origins such as:
* or &lt;br&gt;Literally: &#x27;God reward you with goodness&#x27; or &#x27;God bless you&#x27;&lt;br&gt;Usage: Used to show gratitude to someone
* &lt;br&gt;Literally: &#x27;May God remain with you&#x27;&lt;br&gt;Usage: Used by the person who is leaving
* &lt;br&gt;Literally: &#x27;May God go with you&#x27;&lt;br&gt;Usage: Used by the person who is staying behind

==Phonology==
/u/ can also be lowered to . Vowel [e] only occurs in loanwords from Spanish, Ilocano, and Tagalog.

/h/ can also be heard as a velar fricative . Ivatan is one of the Philippine languages that do not exhibit []-[d] allophony.

==Writing system==
Ivatan is written using the Latin alphabet. As Ivatan is primarily a spoken language and seldom used in written form, there is currently no consistent way of writing the language and different conventions may be used by different writers. An orthography devised for use in public schools by the Department of Education uses the full 26-letter Latin alphabet, with three extra letters, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ñ&quot;, and &quot;ng&quot;.

The schwa sound, or uh, is normally represented by the letter &quot;e&quot; as in , &#x27;di-yos-ma-ma-huhs&#x27;, and &#x27;pa-luhk&#x27;.

<doc id="1171414" wikidata="Q6904903" url="?curid=1171414" title="Monte Sano Mountain">
<text>Monte Sano Mountain is a mountain located in Huntsville, Alabama. The name &quot;Monte Sano&quot; is Spanish for &quot;Mountain of health&quot;. The mountain was given its name by Dr. Thomas Fern, who along with his two brothers, founded a small colony on the mountain during an epidemic of yellow fever, malaria, and cholera. The location on the mountain was chosen because of its cool air and medicinal springs.
The top is relatively flat and lies just under 500 meters above sea level. This elevation is about 300 meters higher than the floor of the Tennessee Valley, which surrounds it. A residential neighborhood occupies the western portion of the top. The eastern portion and slopes of the mountain are occupied by Monte Sano State Park. Monte Sano is connected to Round Top (Burritt) Mountain by a col to the south.

==Hotel Monte Sano &amp; Railway==

The summer months in the late 1800s saw yellow fever, cholera and diphtheria in high proportions. Clean water and sanitary living conditions were found on the mountain and visitors&#x27; health improved. However, because the causes of these diseases were not yet fully understood, many again would become ill after returning home.

In 1886, the Hotel Monte Sano was built to serve as a health resort for hundreds of people. The hotel was a three-story 223 room wooden structure of Queen Anne architecture, with rooms costing $11.00 per week, including meals. Resort amusements included horseback riding, two bowling alleys, croquet, billiards, lawn tennis, and beautiful gardens. Patrons traveled the eight miles from the Huntsville Depot to the hotel in four hours by horse and carriage.

The popular resort&#x27;s register showed guests from every state in the union and from several foreign countries. Visitors included philanthropist William H. Vanderbilt, Viscount William Waldorf Astor, composer Walter Damrosch, and railroad financier Jay Gould.
To better serve guests, the eight-mile Monte Sano Railway was created between May and August 1888. The 25 cent train ride took 20 minutes and made three trips per day. However, shortly after completion, the train&#x27;s brake sand pipes choked, the wheels jumped the rails, and the train came to a quick stop. There was no injury to passengers or damage to the train, but the incident frightened potential riders. Thereafter, the railway was primarily used for hauling supplies until it went into bankruptcy in 1896.

Once the cause and cure for yellow fever and cholera were discovered, a trip to the &quot;Mountain of Health&quot; was no longer necessary. Transportation problems and lack of patrons stifled business to the hotel, and its last season was 1900.

==Geology==

Geologically, Monte Sano is a mesa separated from the main Cumberland Plateau by the Flint River Valley. It is characterized by a resistant sandstone caprock of the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation overlying more soluble layers of Mississippian limestone. The Mississippian limestone is rich in marine fossils, especially crinoids and blastoids.

==Western Slope==
Much of the western slope of the mountain - the backdrop for downtown Huntsville and 2 miles from City Hall - comprises the Monte Sano Nature Preserve owned and managed by the Land Trust of North Alabama. Established in 1987 as Alabama&#x27;s first land trust, the Land Trust of North Alabama is an accredited not-for-profit organization dedicated to preserving land, fresh water resources, local farms, and habitat.

The Monte Sano Nature Preserve is one of the largest urban nature preserves in the US and one of six nature preserves in the area maintained by the Land Trust of North Alabama. The Monte Sano Nature Preserve consists of over 1,107 acres and offers 23+ miles of public trails. The extensive trail system, along with those of the Land Trust&#x27;s Wade mountain, Harvest Square, and Blevins Gap Nature Preserve, were the first to be honored as National Recreation Trails in Madison County.

Along with the Land Trust, volunteers have crafted and maintain the trails. Land Trust trails include Three Caves Loop, Bluff Line, Toll Gate, Alms House, Fagan Springs, Oak Park, and Old Railroad Bed trails. The Old Railroad Bed Trail preserves what is left of the path of the steam locomotive that traveled from the Huntsville Depot to the (no longer standing) Hotel Monte Sano from 1888 to 1896. This trail is one of the first 500 Rails to Trails.

<text>Persea is a genus of about 150 species of evergreen trees belonging to the laurel family, Lauraceae. The best-known member of the genus is the avocado, &quot;P. americana&quot;, widely cultivated in subtropical regions for its large, edible fruit.

==Overview==
They are medium-size trees, tall at maturity. The leaves are simple, lanceolate to broad lanceolate, varying with species from long and broad, and arranged spirally or alternately on the stems. The flowers are in short panicles, with six small greenish-yellow perianth segments long, nine stamens and an ovary with a single embryo. The fruit is an oval or pear-shaped berry, with a fleshy outer covering surrounding the single seed; size is very variable among the species, from in e.g. &quot;P. borbonia&quot; and &quot;P. indica&quot;, up to in some cultivars of &quot;P. americana&quot;.

==Distribution and ecology==

The species of &quot;Persea&quot; have a disjunct distribution, with about 70 Neotropical species, ranging from Brazil and Chile in South America to Central America and Mexico, the Caribbean, and the southeastern United States; a single species, &quot;P. indica&quot;, endemic to Madeira and the Canary Islands off northwest Africa; and 80 species inhabiting east and southeast Asia. None of the species are very tolerant of severe winter cold, with the hardiest, &quot;P. borbonia&quot;, &quot;P. ichangensis&quot; and &quot;P. lingue&quot;, surviving temperatures down to about ; they also require continuously moist soil, and do not tolerate drought. A number of these species are found in forests that face threats of destruction or deforestation; for example, &quot;P. lingue&quot; in Central Chile.

The family Lauraceae was part of the land flora of Gondwana, and many genera had migrated to South America via Antarctica over ocean landbridges by the time of the Paleocene. From South America they spread over most of the continent. When the North American and South American tectonic plates joined in the late Neogene, volcanic mountain building created island chains which later formed the Mesoamerican landbridge. Pliocene elevation created new habitats for speciation. While some genera died out in increasingly xerophytic mainland Africa, starting with the freezing of Antarctica about 20 million years ago and the formation of the Benguela current, others, which also reached South America and Mesoamerica, such as &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot; and &quot;Nectandra&quot; are still surviving today in Africa in a number of species. The genus, however, died out in Africa, except for &quot;P. indica&quot;, which is, today, a threatened species that survives in the fog-shrouded mountains of the Canary Islands and Madeira.

Fossil evidence indicates that the genus originated in West Africa during the Paleocene, and spread to Asia, to South America, and to Europe and thence to North America. It is thought that the gradual drying of Africa, west Asia, and the Mediterranean from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene, and the glaciation of Europe during the Pleistocene, caused the extinction of the genus across these regions, resulting in the present distribution.

Since this habitat is constantly threatened by encroaching agriculture, the laurel forest animal or vegetal species have already become rare in many of its former habitats and are threatened by further habitat loss.

In Mesoamerica, &quot;Persea&quot; proliferated into many new species, and the berries of some of them constitute a valuable food supply for quetzals, trogoniform birds that live in the montane rainforests of Mesoamerica. In particular, the resplendent quetzal&#x27;s favorite fruits are berries of wild relatives of the avocado. Their differing maturing times in the cloudforest determine the migratory movements of the quetzals to differing elevation levels in the forests. With a gape width of , the quetzal swallows the small berry (aguacatillo) whole, which he catches while flying through the lower canopy of the tree, and then regurgitates the seed within from the tree. Wheelright in 1983 observed that parent quetzals take far less time intervals to deliver fruits to the young brood than insects or lizards, reflecting the ease of procuring fruits, as opposed to capturing animal prey. Since the young are fed exclusively berries in the first 2 weeks after hatching, these berries must be of high nutritional value. Usually only the total percentage of water, sugar, nitrogen, crude fats and carbohydrates are reported by ornithologists.

&quot;Persea&quot; species are also used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including giant leopard moth, &quot;Coleophora octagonella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;P. carolinensis&quot;) and &quot;Hypercompe indecisa&quot;.

===Classification===
The genus &quot;Persea&quot; is treated in three subgenera. The Asian subgenus &quot;Machilus&quot; is treated in a separate genus Machilus by many authors, including in the &quot;Flora of China&quot;, while graft-incompatibility between subgenus &quot;Persea&quot; and subgenus &quot;Eriodaphne&quot; suggests that these too may be better treated as distinct genera, in fact Kostermans (1993) founded the genus &quot;Mutisiopersea&quot; for these. Another closely related genus, &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot;, is also sometimes included in &quot;Persea&quot;.

In a phylogenetic analysis of the &quot;&quot;Persea&quot; group&quot;, which also includes &quot;Alseodaphne&quot;, &quot;Phoebe, Nothaphoebe, Dehaasia&quot; and &quot;Apollonias, Persea&quot; was found to be mostly monophyletic, with &quot;Apollonias barbujana&quot; from the Canary Islands nested within the core &quot;Persea&quot; group. The species &quot;Persea&quot; &quot;nudigemma&quot; was found to be more closely related to &quot;Phoebe&quot;, while &quot;Persea sphaerocarpa&quot; was found to be nested within a group of &quot;Alseodaphne&quot; species.

<text>Christmas Sunday is a name for the Sunday after Christmas.

In the United Kingdom, if Christmas Day falls on a Saturday, 26 December is sometimes referred to as &quot;Christmas Sunday&quot;, and Boxing Day moves to 27 December, although this practice has now fallen out of common usage and 26 December is usually referred to as Boxing Day even when it falls on a Sunday.

In Western Christianity, the first Sunday after Christmas is called the &quot;First Sunday of Christmas&quot;.

Christmas Sunday usually coincides with the &quot;Sunday After the Nativity&quot; feast day that commemorates King David, Saint Joseph (who is called &quot;Joseph the Betrothed&quot;), and James the Brother of the Lord. Special hymns for these saints are found in the Menaion, which are combined with hymns for the Feast of the Nativity, and special Epistle and Gospel readings are chanted at the Divine Liturgy. If there is no Sunday between December 25 and January 1, this feast is moved to December 26, where it is combined with the Synaxis of the Theotokos. The Saturday After Nativity also has a special Epistle and Gospel reading (though no hymns, except those of the Afterfeast). The Saturday Before Theophany has a special Epistle and Gospel reading of its own, and if both days fall on the same Saturday, both sets of readings are chanted.

<text>Henri Leconte (; born 4 July 1963) is a French former professional tennis player. He reached the men&#x27;s singles final at the French Open in 1988, won the French Open men&#x27;s doubles title in 1984, and helped France win the Davis Cup in 1991. During his career, he won singles titles on all four major court surfaces: hard, clay, grass and carpet. Leconte&#x27;s career-high singles ranking was world No. 5.

==Biography and career==
Leconte first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as an outstanding junior player who won the French Open junior title in 1981. He turned professional that year and won his first career doubles title at Bologna, and his first top-level singles title the following year, 1982, in Stockholm. Leconte played in the Davis Cup final for the first time in 1982, when France was defeated 4–1 by the United States.

Leconte teamed up with Yannick Noah to win the men&#x27;s doubles title at the French Open in 1984. In 1985, Leconte and Noah reached a second Grand Slam doubles final at the US Open, where they finished runners-up. Leconte reached his career-high doubles ranking of world No. 6 in 1985. In singles in 1985, Leconte reached the quarterfinals of the French Open and Wimbledon, the latter run of which included a dazzling win over world no. 2, Ivan Lendl, in the fourth round.

1986 saw Leconte reach two Grand Slam singles semi-finals at the French Open and Wimbledon, and attain his career-high singles ranking of world No. 5. Leconte also played on the French team that won the World Team Cup that year.

In 1988, Leconte reached the men&#x27;s singles final at the French Open beating Simon Youl, Bruno Orešar, Horacio de la Peña, Boris Becker, Andrei Chesnokov and Jonas Svensson. In the final, despite strong support from the French crowd, Leconte could not overcome two-time former champion Mats Wilander who defeated him in straight sets.

In 1991, Leconte was involved in the Davis Cup final for a second time. France again faced the US, and this time Leconte defeated Pete Sampras in straight sets in a critical singles rubber, and also teamed with Guy Forget to win the doubles rubber, as France upset the heavily favoured U.S. team 3–1.

In total, Leconte played for France&#x27;s Davis Cup team for a total of 13 consecutive years, compiling a 41–25 record. He compiled a doubles record of 17–5 and was undefeated with Guy Forget (11 wins), winning his last 14 doubles matches (from March 1985 to July 1993).

Leconte won his final top-level singles title in 1993 in Halle. He also won his final doubles title that year at Indian Wells.

Leconte retired from the professional tour in 1996, having won a total of nine career singles titles and ten doubles titles. Playing on the ATP Champions Tour for over-35&#x27;s, he formed a doubles partnership with the Iranian player Mansour Bahrami.

He is now the manager of an event company (HL Event) based in Belgium and opened a tennis academy in Fès, Morocco, in 2006.

Since 2010, Leconte has appeared on Australian television as a commentator on the Seven Network&#x27;s coverage of the Australian Open. There, he obtained a cult following as a result of a zany exhibition doubles performance, and his passionate and often parochial commentary, especially for compatriot Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, whose winning shots he routinely described as &quot;unbelievable!&quot;

In 2014, Leconte appeared as a commentator for the 2014 Australian Open. One match he commentated was the third-round match between Frenchmen Gilles Simon and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He has since appeared regularly as a commentator for matches involving French players in the men&#x27;s draw.

==Grand Slam singles performance timeline==

==Trivia==
He participated in 2005 in the second season of &quot;La Ferme Célébrités&quot;, a TV reality game show. In 2007, his son Maxime also participated in the TV reality game show &quot;Secret Story&quot;, the French version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.
He also appeared as a contestant on BBC Celebrity Masterchef 2017, reaching the semifinals.

<text>The Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Heritage Trust (S&amp;DRHT) is a heritage railway line in Somerset, England, that runs on a restored section of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The line is approximately 1 mile long and operates from Midsomer Norton South. 

==History==
=== British Railways ownership ===
The Evercreech to Bath section of the S&amp;D, the section which Midsomer Norton South was a part of, opened on 20 July 1874. It was a final attempt by the S&amp;D to achieve profitability by connecting to Bath and crossing the Somerset Coalfield. This failed however, and the railway became jointly owned by the Midland Railway (MR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). At the 1923 Grouping, the line became jointly owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway, as successors to the MR and LSWR respectively.

After nationalisation in 1948 the line became part of the Southern Region, the era that the trust aims to preserve after. Following the Beeching Report in 1963 it was announced that the line would close and did so on 6 March 1966.

=== Heritage railway ===
The S&amp;D Heritage Trust was formed some 30 years after the closure of the S&amp;DJR in 1966 under the Beeching Axe, headquartered in Midsomer Norton. The station site was sold in 1969 to a local school, and then in 1995 to the Wansdyke district council, who leased it to the Trust to restore to its 1950s condition.

The Trust has since restored the original station buildings, a signalbox and a goods shed. A museum is located in an old horse stable block that houses a collection of S&amp;DJR memorabilia, and there is also a pillbox with World War II exhibits. Having agreed a lease arrangement with the trackbed owners, the Trust has over time relaid the track which now runs for 1 mile from the station up the ruling 1:50 gradient to the infilled cutting towards . The railway bridge over Silver St has been removed, and further extension Southwards will require removal of the in-fill and restoration of the former Chilcompton railway tunnel. 

Commercial activities such as catering, retail services and the operation of public trains over the original trackbed come under the control of the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway Company Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust. It is separate to and should not be confused with the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust, which is located at the West Somerset Railway&#x27;s Washford railway station.

In May 2013 an online appeal was launched to raise £500,000 by 30 September 2013 to purchase the station at the summit of the S&amp;DJR at . The Trust eventually raised only £80,000 by the deadline, and the site was sold to another party.

==Operations==

The line has a variety of rolling stock that can be used to provide an arrange of events and running days for the public. On a typical running day, the railway runs a
three coach train with steam at one end and diesel at the other. Some events that the railway has done over the past few years include:
* Visits from local schools or private events such as societies or tourists.
* Santa and Easter specials.
* Pines Express remembered gala, this typically takes place in September to mark the anniversary of the last Pines Express.
* Real Ale Trains

<doc id="1171466" wikidata="Q193469" url="?curid=1171466" title="Takin">
<text>The takin (Budorcas taxicolor; ), also called cattle chamois or gnu goat, is a large species of ungulate of the subfamily Caprinae found in the eastern Himalayas. It includes four subspecies: the Mishmi takin (&quot;B. t. taxicolor&quot;), the golden takin (&quot;B. t. bedfordi&quot;), the Tibetan (or Sichuan) takin (&quot;B. t. tibetana&quot;), and the Bhutan takin (&quot;B. t. whitei&quot;).

Whilst the takin has in the past been placed together with the muskox in the tribe Ovibovini, more recent mitochondrial research shows a closer relationship to &quot;Ovis&quot; (sheep). Its physical similarity to the muskox is therefore an example of convergent evolution. The takin is the national animal of Bhutan.

==Etymology==
The specific name &quot;taxicolor&quot; comes from and referring to badger-like coloration.

==Appearance==
The takin rivals the muskox as the largest and stockiest of the subfamily Caprinae, which includes goats, sheep, and similar species. Its short legs are supported by large, two-toed hooves, which each have a highly developed spur. It has a stocky body and a deep chest. Its large head is distinctive by its long, arched nose and stout horns, which are ridged at the base. Horns are present in both sexes, and run parallel to the skull before turning upwards to a short point; they are about long, but can grow up to . Its long, shaggy coat is light in color with a dark stripe along the back, and males (bulls) also have dark faces.

Four subspecies of takin are currently recognised, and these tend to show a variation in coat colour. Their thick wool often turns black in colour on their undersides and legs. Their overall coloration ranges from dark blackish to reddish-brown suffused with grayish-yellow in the eastern Himalayas to lighter yellow-gray in the Sichuan Province to mostly golden or (rarely) creamy-white with fewer black hairs in the Shaanxi Province.

The legend of the &#x27;golden fleece&#x27; sought by Jason and the Argonauts may have been inspired by the lustrous coat of the golden takin (&quot;B. t. bedfordi&quot;). Hair length can range from , on the flanks of the body in summer, up to on the underside of the head in winter.

In height, takin stand at the shoulder, but measure a relatively short in head-and-body length, with the tail adding only an additional . Measurements of weights vary, but according to most reports, the males are slightly larger, weighing against in females. Sources including Betham (1908) report that females are larger, with the largest captive takin known to the author, at , having been female. Takin can weigh up to or in some cases.

Instead of relying on localized scent glands, the takin secretes an oily, strong-smelling substance over its whole body, enabling it to mark objects such as trees. A prominent nose with a swollen appearance caused biologist George Schaller to liken the takin to a &quot;bee-stung moose.&quot; Features reminiscent of familiar domesticated species have earned takins such nicknames as &quot;cattle chamois&quot; and &quot;gnu goat.&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
Takin are found from forested valleys to rocky, grass-covered alpine zones, at altitudes between above sea level. The Mishmi takin occurs in eastern Arunachal Pradesh, while the Bhutan takin is in western Arunachal Pradesh and Bhutan. Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh, India is a stronghold of both Mishmi, Upper Siang (Kopu) and Bhutan takins.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Takin are found in small family groups of around 20 individuals, although older males may lead more solitary existences. In the summer, herds of up to 300 individuals gather high on the mountain slopes. Groups often appear to occur in largest numbers when favorable feeding sites, salt licks, or hot springs are located. Mating takes place in July and August. Adult males compete for dominance by sparring head-to-head with opponents, and both sexes appear to use the scent of their own urine to indicate dominance. A single young is born after a gestation period of around eight months. Takin migrate from the upper pasture to lower, more forested areas in winter and favor sunny spots upon sunrise. When disturbed, individuals give a &#x27;cough&#x27; alarm call and the herd retreats into thick bamboo thickets and lies on the ground for camouflage.

Takin feed in the early morning and late afternoon, grazing on a variety of leaves and grasses, as well as bamboo shoots and flowers. They have been observed standing on their hind legs to feed on leaves over high. Salt is also an important part of their diets, and groups may stay at a mineral deposit for several days.

==Threats==
The takin is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and considered Endangered in China. It is threatened by overhunting and the destruction of its natural habitat. It is not a common species naturally, and the population appears to have been reduced considerably. Takin horns have appeared in the illegal wildlife trade in Myanmar; and during three surveys carried out from 1999 to 2006 in the Tachilek market, a total of 89 sets of horns were observed openly for sale.

<doc id="1171473" wikidata="Q940412" url="?curid=1171473" title="Electric Warrior">
<text>Electric Warrior is the second studio album by English rock band T. Rex and their sixth since their 1968 debut as Tyrannosaurus Rex, released on 24 September 1971. The album marked a turning point in the band&#x27;s style, moving away from the folk-oriented sound of the group&#x27;s previous albums and pioneering a more flamboyant, pop-oriented glam rock style.

The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Specifically, the single &quot;Get It On&quot; helped to boost the album&#x27;s sales, reaching the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. Retitled &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On)&quot; by the US record company, it also became the band&#x27;s only North American hit. &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; has since received acclaim as a pivotal release in the glam rock movement. It had a profound influence on later musicians of different genres.

==Background==

As T. Rex re-entered the studio to record its next album in March 1971, the band was riding a wave of sudden success prompted by its first single, &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;, hitting number 2 in the UK charts that January, followed by &quot;Hot Love&quot; which topped the charts for six straight weeks through March and April. While promoting &quot;Hot Love&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on March 24, Marc Bolan had appeared in a silver satin suit with glitter under his eyes, sparking the glam rock craze. At the same time, the self-titled debut T. Rex album peaked within the top 10 and demand for the group&#x27;s concert appearances soared. The group now set its sights on the United States, where a month-long tour was set for April (the first with a new four-man lineup, including newest member Bill Legend on drums) during which they would end up recording much of &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;. 

==Songs and recording==
The lyrics on the new album marked a dramatic departure from the dense Romantic poeticism and Tolkien fantasy imagery of Bolan&#x27;s first five albums, including the most recent &quot;T. Rex&quot; album. Marc explained that he was now writing about himself for the first time, songs he described as personal and &quot;erotic&quot;. Fantastic imagery was still present, only now presented with a new stripped-down immediacy that was fused with basic rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll imagery of cars, women, and boogie. Musically, the album continued the electric pop/rock sound of &quot;T. Rex&quot;, recently expanded to a four-piece band with full bass and drums; only three songs retained primarily acoustic arrangements. Sonic tricks employed on the album identified by producer Tony Visconti, which had been gradually developed over the past five albums, included flanging, reverb, backwards guitars, tape loops, and plugging the guitar directly into the console to overload the mike preamplifiers. In addition, session players included Yes maestro Rick Wakeman on piano (&quot;Get It On&quot;), jazz trumpeter Burt Collins on flugelhorn (&quot;Girl&quot;) and King Crimson&#x27;s Ian McDonald on sax (&quot;Rip-Off&quot;), along with a string section and ex-Turtles Flo &amp; Eddie on androgynous backing vocals, which when fused together created a highly distinctive sound. 

Initial work on the album began on March 5 at Trident Studios in London, where the previous albums had been recorded, with an early version of &quot;Planet Queen&quot; put to tape. On March 16, similarly rough versions of &quot;Mambo Sun&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; were laid down with no producer present and no particular plan for an album yet. Remakes of the latter two songs were attempted at Trident on March 30, with early takes of &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; featuring Marc on a Fender Stratocaster before feeling the sound was wrong and switching to an acoustic. Once in America for the tour, the group met with producer Visconti for sessions at Wally Heider Studios in Hollywood, with Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman of Flo &amp; Eddie participating on backing vocals. On April 18, the band ran through &quot;Get It On&quot;, &quot;Monolith&quot; and a remake of &quot;Planet Queen&quot;. Sessions then moved, with Visconti, to Mediasound Studios in New York City on April 27 where working versions of &quot;Jeepster&quot;, &quot;Lean Woman Blues&quot; and &quot;Girl&quot; (with the working titles &quot;Oh God&quot; and &quot;Electric Witch&quot;) were finished. Visconti later remarked that the relaxed pace of recording in America, where there was no definite goal or pressure to make an album, contributed to the unique feel of the songs. 

Once back in England, extensive mixing of the work done in America proceeded at AIR Studios on May 3. At this point, realizing they had stockpiled a large number of strong tracks, Bolan and Visconti decided to shape it into an album. On May 12, at Advision, &quot;The Motivator&quot;, &quot;Rip Off&quot; and possibly &quot;Life&#x27;s A Gas&quot; were recorded, with early takes of &quot;Rip Off&quot; opening with its guitar riff until it was decided on take 3 to open with drums. The next day at Advision was devoted to overdubs on &quot;Jeepster&quot; and &quot;Lean Woman Blues&quot;, with final overdubs to &quot;Rip Off&quot; and the taping of two new songs destined for B-side release, &quot;There Was A Time&quot; and &quot;Raw Ramp/Electric Boogie&quot;, in early June. On July 21, a master tape of the album was compiled back at Trident, although it featured a different running order of songs.

==Artwork==
The cover artwork was designed by English art design group Hipgnosis, based on a photo taken by Kieron &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy of Marc Bolan at a T. Rex concert in Nottingham on May 14, 1971. The image is printed in metallic gold on a matte black background, at least for the original UK issue on Fly Records and the first German issue on Ariola. In early July, Murphy also took the photo of the band relaxing in Marc&#x27;s flat that was used for the poster that was included with the first issue in the UK and Germany. A hype sticker (&quot;free T. Rex poster inside&quot;) advertised the poster in the UK. Some hype stickers for modern &quot;remastering&quot; campaigns are designed in a similar style as the original hype sticker. The poster picture was used for the gatefold of the US issue on Reprise Records. The inner sleeve artwork of the UK issue, portraits of Marc Bolan and Mickey Finn, was drawn by artist George Underwood, who had drawn the artwork for the first Tyrannosaurus Rex album in 1968, &quot;My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They&#x27;re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows&quot;. The first German Ariola issue used the inner sleeve artwork for the gatefold.

The artwork served as the inspiration for the French electronic duo Justice, who paid homage in the design of their debut studio album, &quot;†&quot;.

==Promotion==
T. Rex heavily promoted &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; through a string of tours, interviews, radio, and TV appearances through late 1971 and early 1972. Besides multiple appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; the group also appeared on European shows like &quot;Beat-Club&quot;, &quot;Starparade&quot; and &quot;Hits A Go-Go&quot;. A fall 1971 tour of the UK provoked scenes of fan hysteria unprecedented since the heyday of Beatlemania, causing the press to dub the new craze &quot;T. Rextasy&quot;. A short US tour in February 1972 of mid-sized venues proved moderately successful as &quot;Get It On&quot;, redubbed &quot;Bang a Gong&quot; for the American market, became the group&#x27;s only top ten hit in that country. 

Marc Bolan, in a 1971 interview contained on the Rhino Records reissue, said of the album, &quot;I think &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;, for me, is the first album which is a statement of 1971 for us in England. I mean that&#x27;s... If anyone ever wanted to know why we were big in the other part of the world, that album says it, for me.&quot; In another interview that year responding to charges that his music had &quot;sold out&quot; to commercialism, he stated &quot;We didn&#x27;t sell out or change the music; the music&#x27;s the same. It&#x27;s just that now it&#x27;s timed in the cosmos to be successful.&quot; 

Bolan was a guest on the BBC Television show &quot;Cilla&quot; in January 1973, where he and Cilla Black sang an acoustic version of &quot;Life&#x27;s a Gas&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Electric Warrior&quot; was released on 24 September 1971 by record label Fly in the UK and Reprise in the US. It went to number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, staying at the slot for 8 weeks. The album remained in the UK chart for a total of 44 weeks. In the US, &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; reached number 32 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Get It On&quot; in July and &quot;Jeepster&quot; in November. &quot;Get It On&quot; was T. Rex&#x27;s biggest selling single, staying four weeks at the top of the UK chart and becoming the band&#x27;s only top-ten US hit. In the United States, &quot;Get It On&quot;&#x27;s title was originally changed to &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On)&quot; to distinguish it from Chase&#x27;s song &quot;Get It On&quot;, which was also released in late 1971. &quot;Jeepster&quot; managed to reach number 2 in the UK although it was released by Fly without Bolan&#x27;s permission, making him reluctant to promote it.

==Reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
In a positive 1972 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ben Gerson noted Bolan&#x27;s transition from his earlier fairytale lyrics, noting that now &quot;his targets are your common rock &amp; roll cliches, as well as your common pseudo-poetic, pseudo-philosophical rock &amp; roll cliches [...] What Marc seems to be saying on &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; is that rock is ultimately as quaint as wizards and unicorns, and finally, as defunct. Gerson concluded that the album established Bolan as &quot;the heaviest rocker under 5’4″ in the world today.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was reserved in his praise: &quot;A freak hit turned [Bolan] into a singer of rhythmic fairy tales for British pre-pubes, exactly what he was always suited for, and the great &#x27;Bang a Gong&#x27; extends his subject matter into the rock myth itself, which has its limits but sure beats unicorns. Now if he&#x27;d only recycle a few more pop readymades I could stop complaining about fey.&quot;

Over in Bolan&#x27;s home country of the UK, the album was received with near-unanimous acclaim. Nick Logan at &quot;NME&quot; remarked that Bolan had &quot;drawn upon the range of rock and roll influences that is the diet of any child of rock, impress them with his own individual penchant for lyrics and a finely tuned producer&#x27;s ear, and drag them kicking and screaming into &#x27;71&quot;. Chris Welch at &quot;Melody Maker&quot; gushed that &quot;Marc&#x27;s music is getting better all the time&quot; while Martin Hayman of &quot;Sounds&quot; claimed it was &quot;all down to the new, dynamic T. Rex of their recent single releases, with a much fuller, stronger sound than before&quot;. Val Mabbs of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called it by far the best album the group had made, also complimenting the cover art, poster, and illustrations in the gatefold sleeve. 

===Retrospective reviews===
Retrospectively, &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Marc Bolan&#x27;s best works. Chris Jones of &quot;BBC Music&quot; called the album a &quot;slice of pop heaven,&quot; and stated that &quot;this was the point at which he and long-term producer Tony Visconti took the hippy-dippy lyrics and Larry the lamb vocal stylings and bolted them on to good old stripped-down, four-to-the-floor rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; In his retrospective review, Steve Huey of AllMusic called it &quot;the album that essentially kick-started the U.K. glam rock craze&quot; and wrote that &quot;the real reason &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; stands the test of time so well – despite its intended disposability – is that it revels so freely in its own absurdity and wilful lack of substance [...] Bolan&#x27;s lack of pomposity, back-to-basics songwriting, and elaborate theatrics went on to influence everything from hard rock to punk to new wave.&quot; Brian James of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;the first and best of a trio of brilliant albums,&quot; stating that &quot;When T.Rex is kicking out the jams, they sound like they&#x27;re having the most gleeful, absurd good time ever committed to wax,&quot; but adding that &quot;the most significant aspect of &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; isn&#x27;t its arena rock confidence; it&#x27;s that Bolan allows his grinning mask to slip [...] On ballads like &#x27;Cosmic Dancer&#x27;, &#x27;Monolith&#x27; and &#x27;Girl&#x27;, he speaks in the same gibberish as elsewhere, but he&#x27;s clearly haunted-- by what we can&#x27;t say.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1987, &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; was ranked number 100 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the Last 20 Years&quot; list. In 2003, the album was ranked number 160 by the same magazine in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 188 in a 2020 revised list. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; as the 20th best album of the 1970s. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.
It was voted number 873 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Legacy==
The album is credited as the first glam rock album, pioneering the development of the glam scene.

The Jam&#x27;s Paul Weller cited it as one of his all-time favourite records, hailing Bolan&#x27;s guitar playing as &quot;really unique. You know his sound instantly.&quot; Lol Tolhurst of the Cure said that the band listened to it during their formative years: &quot;We were listening to T.Rex at this time,” [...] “I recall Robert [Smith] had a copy of &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;&quot;. The Slits&#x27;s guitarist Viv Albertine also mentioned a special liking for this album for &quot;the whole sound, the whole cartoony, sexual, and thing, it&#x27;s very English as well. I think Prince has taken so much from Bolan.&quot; The Bongos released a cover of “Mambo Sun” which hit number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club chart in April 1981. PJ Harvey&#x27;s main collaborator John Parish included the album among his favourites: &quot;when I&#x27;m working... I like to have a few records that are most important for me, which I periodically stick on to remind myself just how good records can be. [...] I have a duty to at least try and make something as sweet and irresistible as this&quot;. Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream has cited &quot;Get it On&quot; as one of his all-time favorite pop songs, adding &quot;When I was growing up, singles were an art statement. [...] People like [..] T. Rex were changing all the time. As a fan you wanted to know what they were going to wear and whether you could follow them to that new place&quot;.

==Use in media==
&quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; is featured prominently in the soundtrack of the final segment of the 2019 Netflix documentary &quot;Dancing with the Birds&quot;, in which a male Carola&#x27;s parotia successfully woos a female into mating with his courtship display. It was also played in the opening sequence of the 2000 film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;.

&quot;Jeepster&quot; can be heard playing on a jukebox in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Death Proof&quot;. &quot;Planet Queen&quot; and &quot;Get it On&quot; was included in the soundtrack of the 2024 film &quot;Longlegs&quot;.

<doc id="1171476" wikidata="Q784466" url="?curid=1171476" title="Itavia Flight 870">
<text>On 27 June 1980, Itavia Flight 870 (IH 870, AJ 421), a Douglas DC-9 passenger jet en route from Bologna to Palermo, Italy, crashed into the Tyrrhenian Sea between the islands of Ponza and Ustica at 20:59 CEST, killing all 81 occupants on board.

Known in Italy as the Ustica massacre (&quot;strage di Ustica&quot;), the disaster led to numerous investigations, as well as legal actions and accusations; it continues to be a source of controversy, including claims of conspiracy by the Government of Italy and others. Francesco Cossiga, the Prime Minister of Italy at the time, attributed the crash to the accidental shooting down by a French missile during a dogfight between Libyan and French fighter jets. In September 2023, former Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato declared that the accident was &quot;part of a plan to shoot down the airplane of Gaddafi&quot;.

==Aircraft==

The aircraft, flown as Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870, was a Douglas DC-9-15, serial number &quot;45724&quot;, registered as &quot;I-TIGI&quot;. At the time of the accident, it had flown for 29544 hours over 45032 flights. The aircraft was manufactured in 1966 and delivered to Hawaiian Airlines registered &quot;N902H&quot;.

==Disaster==
On 27 June 1980 at 20:08 CEST, the aircraft departed with a delay of one hour and 53 minutes from Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport for a scheduled service to Palermo Punta Raisi Airport, Sicily. With 77 passengers aboard, Captain Domenico Gatti (34), and First Officer Enzo Fontana (32), were at the controls, with two flight attendants. The flight was designated IH 870 by air traffic control, while the military radar system used AJ 421.

Contact was lost shortly after the last message from the aircraft was received at 20:37, giving its position over the Tyrrhenian Sea near the island of Ustica, about southwest of Naples. At 20:59 CEST, the aircraft broke apart in mid-air and crashed.
Two Italian Air Force F-104s were scrambled at 21:00 from Grosseto Air Force Base to locate the accident area and search for any survivors but failed to locate the area because of poor visibility.

Floating wreckage parts were later found in the area. There were no survivors among the 81 occupants on board.

In July 2006, the re-assembled fragments of the DC-9 were returned to Bologna from Pratica di Mare Air Force Base near Rome.

==Official statements and litigation==
The perpetrators of the crime remain unidentified. After hearings held from 1989 to 1991, the Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism, headed by Senator Libero Gualtieri, issued an official statement concerning the crash of Flight 870, which became known as the &quot;Ustica Massacre&quot; (&quot;Strage di Ustica&quot;). Then the crash was referred to by a &quot;prima facie&quot; judicial act as &quot;primarily an act of war, a de facto unreported war – as has been customary ever since Pearl Harbor, until the latest Balkan conflict – an international police operation, in fact, up to the great powers, since there was no mandate in this sense; a non-military coercive action exercised lawfully or illicitly, by one State against another; or an act of terrorism, as it was later claimed, of an attack on a head of state or regime leader.&quot;.

A number of Italian Air Force personnel have been investigated and tried for a number of alleged offences, including falsification of documents, high treason, perjury, abuse of office and aiding and abetting. None have been convicted. On 30 April 2004, Generals Corrado Melillo and Zeno Tascio were held to be not guilty of high treason. Lesser charges against a number of other military personnel were also dropped. Other allegations could no longer be pursued after the expiration of the statute of limitations, since the disaster had occurred more than 15 years before, which included charges against Generals Lamberto Bartolucci and Franco Ferri. In 2005, an appeals court ruled that no evidence supported the charges. On 10 January 2007, the Italian Court of Cassation upheld this ruling and conclusively closed the case, fully acquitting Bartolucci and Ferri of any wrongdoing.

In June 2010, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano urged all Italian authorities to cooperate in the investigation of the accident.

In September 2011, a Palermo civil tribunal ordered the Italian government to pay 100 million euros ($137 million) in civil damages to the relatives of the victims for failing to protect the flight, concealing the truth and destroying evidence.

On 23 January 2013, the Civil Cassation Court ruled that there was &quot;abundantly&quot; clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a stray missile, confirming the lower court&#x27;s order that the Italian government must pay compensation.

In April 2015, an appeals court in Palermo confirmed the rulings of the 2011 Palermo civil tribunal and dismissed an appeal by the state attorney.

==Hypotheses on the causes==
===Terrorist bomb===
After the series of bombings that hit Italy in the 1970s, a terrorist act was the first explanation to be proposed. As the flight was delayed in Bologna by almost three hours, a bomb&#x27;s timer may have been set to actually cause an explosion at the Palermo airport, or on a further flight of the same aircraft.

The 1990 judicial inquiry was supported by a technical commission, led by independent investigator Frank Taylor. The technical commission&#x27;s report concluded that an explosion in the rear toilet, and not a missile strike, was the only conclusion supported by the wreckage analysis. A test explosion in a DC-9 lavatory had shown the resulting deformation in the surrounding structure to be almost identical to that of the accident aircraft.

The technical commission&#x27;s report was criticised in the Italian media by &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; and &quot;La Repubblica&quot;. In particular it was stated that there was no evidence of explosive residue, per tests performed in 1994 by the Defence Research Agency in the United Kingdom.

===Missile strike during military operation===
Parts of the Italian media alleged that the aircraft was shot down during a dogfight involving Libyan, United States, French and Italian Air Force fighters in an assassination attempt by NATO members on an important Libyan politician, perhaps even Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was flying in the same airspace that evening. This version was supported in 1999 by Judge Rosario Priore, who said in his concluding report that his investigation had been deliberately obstructed by the Italian military and members of the secret service, in compliance with NATO requests.

According to the Italian media, documents from the archives of the Libyan secret service passed on to Human Rights Watch after the fall of Tripoli show that Flight 870 and a Libyan MiG were attacked by two French jets.

On 18 July 1980, 21 days after the Itavia Flight 870 crash, a Libyan MiG-23MS was found crashed in the Sila Mountains in Castelsilano, Calabria, southern Italy. According to Libyan Air Force sources, the pilot was a victim of hypoxia. As his aircraft&#x27;s autopilot was activated, it just kept flying straight and level until running out of fuel, and eventually crashed in the Sila Mountains.

In 2008, Francesco Cossiga (Prime Minister when the accident occurred) said that Itavia Flight 870 had been shot down by French warplanes. On 7 July 2008, a claim for damages was served on the French President.

In 2023, former Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato said that France downed the aircraft while targeting a Libyan military jet in an attempt to kill Muammar Gaddafi. Amato said that Italy tipped off Libya about the planned assassination and consequently Gaddafi did not board the Libyan military jet.

===Conspiracy theories===
Several conspiracy theories explaining the disaster persist. For example, the vessel that carried out the search for debris on the ocean floor was French, but only US officials had access to the aircraft parts they found. 
Several radar reports were erased and several Italian generals were indicted 20 years later for obstruction of justice. The difficulty the investigators and the victims&#x27; relatives had in receiving complete, reliable information on the Ustica disaster has been popularly described as &quot;un muro di gomma&quot; (literally, a rubber wall), because investigations just seemed to &quot;bounce back&quot;.

==Memorial==

On 27 June 2007, the Museum for the Memory of Ustica was opened in Bologna. The museum is in possession of parts of the plane, which are assembled and on display, including almost all of the external fuselage. The museum also has objects belonging to those on board that were found in the sea near the plane. Christian Boltanski was commissioned to produce a site-specific installation. The installation consists of:
* 81 pulsing lamps hanging over the plane
* 81 black mirrors
* 81 loudspeakers (behind the mirrors)
Each loudspeaker describes a simple thought/worry (e.g. &quot;when I arrive I will go to the beach&quot;). All the objects found are contained in a wooden box covered with a black plastic skin. A small book with photos of all objects and various information is available to visitors upon request.

The crash of Itavia Flight 870 was featured in the 13th season of the Canadian documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Massacre over the Mediterranean&quot;. The episode discussed the separate investigations into the event, and appeared to favour the investigation led by Frank Taylor, which concluded that the wreckage ruled out a missile and pointed to an explosion in or near the rear lavatory was the most likely.

A 1991 Italian film by Marco Risi, &quot;The Invisible Wall&quot;, tells the story of a journalist in search of answers to the many questions left open by the accident. The film theorises on a few possible scenarios, including the possibility that the DC-9 was mistakenly shot down during an aerial engagement between NATO and Libyan jet fighters.

<doc id="1171482" wikidata="Q15979" url="?curid=1171482" title="Kehl">
<text>Kehl (; ) is a city with around 38,000 inhabitants in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It lies in the region of Baden on the Rhine River, at the confluence with the smaller Kinzig River, directly opposite the French and Alsatian city of Strasbourg. It is the third-largest city of the Ortenaukreis (&quot;Ortenau District&quot;) after Offenburg and Lahr/Schwarzwald.

Kehl is mostly known because of its proximity to Strasbourg and as a border city. Strasbourg and Kehl are connected by four Rhine bridges which are from south to north: the &quot;Passerelle des Deux Rives&quot; (pedestrians and cyclists), the &quot;Bridge of Europe&quot; (motorists, pedestrians and cyclists), the &quot;Beatus-Rhenanus Bridge&quot; (tramway, pedestrians and cyclists), and the &quot;Rhine Bridge&quot; (railway).

Line D of the Strasbourg tramway was extended in 2017 to reach Kehl station, and since 2018 there are another two stations within Kehl. It is therefore possible to directly reach the city centre of Strasbourg (stations &quot;Homme de Fer&quot; and &quot;Langstross Grand&#x27;Rue&quot;) as well as Strasbourg Main Station (station &quot;Gare Centrale&quot;) by tramway without having to change.

The &quot;Jardin des Deux Rives&quot;/&quot;Garten der zwei Ufer&quot; extends on both sides of the Rhine, connected by the &quot;Passerelle des Deux Rives&quot;. Strasbourg and Kehl further share some municipal services. Kehl has a large port on the Rhine, the &quot;Häfen Kehl&quot; (Kehl Ports), south of the mouth of the Kinzig, and is the seat of the Kehl University of Applied Sciences (&quot;Hochschule Kehl&quot;).

==History==

The village of Kehl was first mentioned in 1038. In 1338, the first permanent bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg was completed. In 1678, the city was taken over by France, as it was considered to be part of the defense system of Strasbourg. Hence the village was transformed into a fortress in 1683 by the French architect Vauban.

In 1681, the Imperial City of Strasbourg, a territory of the Holy Roman Empire that included Kehl, was annexed by Louis XIV, King of France. This annexation was recognized by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, but all right-bank territories were restored to the Empire, leading to Kehl&#x27;s cession to the Margraviate of Baden the following year.

On May 7, 1770, Marie Antoinette was officially handed over by Austria to France on an island on the Rhine near Kehl. This island, which was uninhabited at the time but turned into a middle class settlement until the First World War, became known as &quot;Kommissionsinsel&quot; after the commission that took over Marie Antoinette.

In 1774, Kehl received town rights by the Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden. The village was badly damaged during the French Revolutionary Wars, especially during the Rhine Campaign of 1796, during the first and second battles of Kehl, and it was besieged by the Austrians in late 1796 until its surrender on 9 January 1797. During the First French Empire, Kehl was reunited with Strasbourg under the French First Republic, before being restored to Baden (now raised to an Electorate) in 1803. After briefly being subject to Austria, the city was finally returned to Baden (now a Grand Duchy) in 1815 and the fortress was dismantled.

Between 1842 and 1847, the first port facility was created by the Baden State Railway Administration. In 1861, the first railway bridge was built and the first direct connection from Paris to Vienna was established, with locomotives being changed over in Kehl.

After the First World War, under article 65 of the Treaty of Versailles the harbor of Kehl was placed under French administration for seven years to prevent possible German attacks on the opposite newly French town of Strasbourg.

During World War II Kehl was located in the so-called &quot;Red Zone&quot; on the western wall, which was cleared when the war broke out: in the night from 3 to 4 September 1939, the population was evacuated to the Black Forest by special trains and was only allowed to return after German troops occupied France.

On November 10, 1938, the Jewish synagogue of Kehl was broken into by Kehl supporters of the SS and members of the Gestapo and all ritual objects were destroyed. All Jewish men from Kehl and the surrounding area were taken to the city hall, abused and then deported to the Dachau. After this night, the Jewish community had to sell the synagogue to the city, after which it was demolished in 1939.

Kehl then became a suburb of Strasbourg. This status was retained even after the war. Kehl was released in accordance with the Washington Agreement on the Clearance of the City of Kehl by France from April 8, 1949, in 42 partial releases from July 29, 1949, to April 8, 1953. At that time (1945 to 1953) Sondheim was an independent municipality, which was then reunited with the city of Kehl. The city and the entire district of Kehl then belonged to the administrative district of South Baden within Baden-Württemberg.

==Religion==

Until 1519, Kehl was part of the diocese of Strasbourg. Then, the village had to change religion at the order of the margraves and the first Lutheran minister took office. During the French occupation of the 1690s, Kehl became Roman Catholic again, only to revert to Lutheranism after being ceded back to the margrave of Baden.

From the early 19th century up to 1914, Lutherans and Catholics shared one church building; then, as the first building on the &quot;Kommissionsinsel&quot; the Catholic Church of St. Johann Nepomuk was erected.

Several free churches are situated in Kehl, including Mennonites and the New Apostolic Church.

<text>Showbread is an American Christian hardcore band formed in Guyton, Georgia, in 1997. The group has gone through numerous lineup changes since its initial formation, but maintains its two core members, Josh Dies and Patrick Porter. The group built an underground fanbase in the late 1990s and early 2000s through word-of-mouth exposure and frequent touring. In 2004, the band signed with Tooth &amp; Nail Records and released their major-label debut, &quot;No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical&quot;. In 2010, the band left Tooth &amp; Nail and joined Come&amp;Live!, an independent record label that releases music via free downloads.

Throughout their career, the band has been subject to much controversy among Christian listeners, over their lyrical themes and personal lifestyles. The members of Showbread have labeled their musical sound as &quot;Raw Rock&quot;. According to former guitarist Matt Davis, the band&#x27;s name comes from &quot;a biblical reference that Jesus used to show how Christianity isn&#x27;t so much about rules but about love.&quot;

Showbread released their final album, &quot;Our Fathers Were Models For God&quot;, on November 15, 2022.

== History ==
The band was formed in 1997 by Patrick Porter and Travis Riner, as a worship band for the Southern Baptist church they attended.
Their church ultimately asked them to leave when they started playing music the church viewed as Satanic. Eventually, Patrick&#x27;s younger brother Josh joined the band, serving as the lead vocalist and primary songwriter after starting as the drummer.

The band went through line-up changes, including the addition of Eddie Ortiz as vocalist, and began playing local and regional shows, which garnered the attention of musicians in other Georgia-based Christian rock bands. It was through these meetings that the additions of Mike Jensen (guitar), Matt Davis (guitar), and John Giddens (synthesizer) took place. Ortiz left the group in 2001 but does appear as vocalist, and is credited, on the independently produced and released record &quot;The Dissonance of Discontent&quot; and plays guitars on the album &quot;Goodbye Is Forever&quot;, he returned briefly to tour and run merchandise for the band in 2004. With their new line-up, Showbread toured independent of management, booking agents, and record labels for two years before signing to Tooth &amp; Nail / Solid State Records in 2004.

=== Tooth &amp; Nail Records and &quot;No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical&quot; (2004–2005) ===
Showbread played at the Cornerstone Festival in summer of that year and quickly gained a strong following. In fall 2004, they released their debut album for Tooth &amp; Nail Records, titled &quot;No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical&quot;. &quot;No Sir&quot; was produced by Sylvia Massy, who has also worked with Prince, Tool, and Johnny Cash.

=== &quot;Age of Reptiles&quot; (2006) ===
Showbread&#x27;s &quot;Age of Reptiles&quot;, was released on August 1, 2006. On this album, Showbread departed drastically from the spastic, screeching style of their previous albums, to a more alternative rock sound, while keeping with their trademark lyrical style and keytar. Also produced by Sylvia Massy, it was recorded in Weed, California at RadioStar Studios.

=== Ivory&#x27;s departure and &quot;Anorexia Nervosa&quot; (2007–2008) ===
On March 4, 2007, Showbread posted on their official website that they would be writing a new record in the spring that they hope to record in the fall and release in 2008.

Showbread announced on April 2, 2007, that Ivory Mobley would be leaving the band in May, his last show being Cornerstone Florida. Ivory then later rejoined the band several times. Two months later, on July 13, 2007, they announced that they asked drummer Justin Oblinger to step down from the band. Oblinger was replaced by Ricky Holbrook, the former drummer of Our Heart&#x27;s Hero.

On May 1, 2007, the band&#x27;s blog became home to bizarre videos and messages filled with codes and hidden messages leading to more clues and hidden messages about the band&#x27;s new record. Fans worked together to connect the puzzle pieces that they believe coincide with the new album. Anorexia Nervosa was announced by the band to be released May 13, 2008. The &quot;album&quot; was released as two separate albums, one called Anorexia and the other Nervosa. Many of the songs on each album share the same names, although the sound is different for each album. They also come with a different story to be read along with the song. The story comes in the form of a booklet in each of the albums. There are time markers above each section of text in the booklet to inform the listener when to read that section during the album. The music often matches the tone of the story in the album booklet in order to create a true multi-sensory experience.

Soon after the joint-release of Anorexia and Nervosa and shortly before the start of the band&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Save Yourself Tour&quot;, John &quot;JG&quot; Giddens, the keytar player, left the band to pursue other interests. Guitarist Matt Davis also left around this time, however Josh decided against announcing his departure. Matt Davis&#x27;s guitar role was replaced by Landon Ginnings, also known by Landon D. Mise (formerly of The Wedding) for the tour and JG&#x27;s by Garrett Holmes. Both members were released after they completed the tour, but returned in 2009. 

=== &quot;The Fear of God&quot; (2009) ===
On August 11, 2009, Showbread released the album &quot;The Fear of God&quot;. Recording began in April at RadioStar Studios in Weed, CA. Frontman Josh Dies has said in a recent interview, &quot;This is a record we&#x27;ve wanted to make for a long time but in the past we&#x27;ve had so many opinions in the band that made it difficult. It&#x27;s about energy, and passion, and aggression. It has a punk rock spirit to it.. There are elements of all the Showbread styles involved, but put together in a new and interesting way... It isn&#x27;t about trying to be anything but raw and just letting it all come out...&quot;

=== Come&amp;Live! and &quot;Who Can Know It?&quot; (2010–2011) ===

On March 29, 2010, Showbread announced signing with independent label Come&amp;Live!. The band stated, &quot;At this point in our lives as Showbread, we have decided to withdraw from many elements of the industry that have been a part of our band for years, sign with Come&amp;Live! and trust God to provide ways for us to offer our music and our performances as free gifts in order to expand the scope of our ministry.&quot; As &quot;musicinaries&quot; the band relies completely on donations from supporters to fund recordings, tours, and basic sustenance.

2010 also marked the departure of guitarists Mike Jensen and Landon Ginnings, with the band continuing as a four-piece.

Showbread created a Kickstarter account for the purpose of funding the debut Come&amp;Live! album on May 17. Their original goal was to raise $13,000 by August 14, so they could record the album. On May 26, they made that goal. By the end of the fundraiser, they raised $33,322. The rest of the money was used for other purposes, such as the upcoming free tour.

On September 21, 2010, Showbread headed down to Weed, California to record the album with Rich Veltrop and Sylvia Massy Shivy at Radio Star Studios. During the recording session, August 10, Showbread announced on their website that the album was going to be titled, &quot;Who Can Know It?&quot;. The band shot a lot of footage from this recording session. They compiled all of the videos and released it as a DVD titled it &quot;Showbread: An Awful Void&quot;. This video also available to stream on the band&#x27;s official YouTube channel, as of March 2014.

&quot;Who Can Know It?&quot; was released on November 16, 2010, through Come&amp;Live!. The album was released in multiple versions. Besides the free digital download through the Come&amp;Live! website, they put out three different physical copies, the standard edition, the special edition, and the vinyl edition.

In February 2011, Josh Dies released a book titled &quot;The Joke That We Play on the World.&quot; The book is a biography of the band&#x27;s history from their beginnings up until the end of 2010. The book contains makings of albums, tours, faith, funny moments, biographies of each band member, past and present, some interviews and articles. The book also contained a digital photo album, which has photos of the band past and present, such as photos of the original lineup.

Showbread were a part of four tours in 2011. From mid-February to April 2011, Showbread went on their first free national tour, &quot;Raw Rock Theology 2011&quot;. At the beginning of the summer Showbread hopped on the second leg of the &quot;Ad Astra Per Aspera Record Release Tour&quot; with Abandon Kansas, Quiet Science, and The Wedding. In mid-summer, the band was a part of &quot;Arrows Are Deadly: Missional Tour&quot; with Ascend the Hill, White Collar Sideshow, and The Ember Days. In the fall, Showbread embarked on a headlining European tour called &quot;Showbread Goes To Europe&quot; with Safemode and The Spirit That Guides Us.

On November 12, 2011, Showbread released their debut remix album titled &quot;Who Can Unknow It?&quot; which is only available as a digital copy through their online store.

=== &quot;Cancer&quot; (2011–2015) ===
During the month of September 2011, there were posts on Showbread&#x27;s Formspring talking about plans for a new concept album. On October 25, 2011, an article from Radio U came out giving small detail regarding a new album. In the interview Josh Dies stated, &quot;[The album is] in developmental stages right now... But what we&#x27;re doing is a science fiction concept album called Cancer.&quot;

Showbread is planning to commemorate the 10th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;No Sir, Nihilism is Not Practical&quot;, with a live performance of the album on August 9, 2014, in Portland, Oregon, with the 2004 album lineup: Matt Davis, Josh Dies, John Giddens, Mike Jensen, Ivory Mobley, Patrick Porter, and Marvin Reilly.

On June 3, 2015, Josh Dies appeared on the Broken Light podcast to discuss Showbread, his writing, and church planting. He discussed the history of the band within the changing landscape of the music industry, and lamented over the ambitious approach to Cancer, and a film that was supposed to accompany the album. While happy with the album itself, he remarked on how the attempt at fulfilling an overly ambitious vision with the movie had stagnated the band&#x27;s ability to tour or create further albums and left them in a perpetual limbo. He also hinted that the end of Showbread would be coming once the Cancer film fiasco had come to a close, and that the band hopes to release at least one more album before calling it quits.

=== &quot;Showbread Is Showdead&quot; (2016) ===
Showbread&#x27;s next album, &quot;Showbread Is Showdead&quot;, was released on January 8, 2016, with the original lineup from &quot;No Sir, Nihilism is Not Practical&quot;. The only physical edition of the album was released in vinyl. Along with the album release, Showbread also released a documentary entitled &quot;The Music Is Dead&quot; and the &quot;Cancer&quot; movie.

On June 21, 2016, the band announced their final show as Showbread.

===Post-Breakup (2020-present)===
On March 7, 2021, the band announced a reunion show to be played at Furnace Fest on September 26.

In November 2022, Showbread released a new album, &quot;Our Fathers Were Models For God&quot;, in concert with Josh Dies&#x27;s new book &quot;Death To Deconstruction: Reclaiming Faithfulness as an Act of Rebellion&quot;.

In February 2023, Furnace Fest announced that Showbread will be playing their music festival on September 22, 2023.

== Traits ==
Showbread is known for giving ridiculous statements in the press and in interviews. Most interviews, regardless of purpose, vary from light hearted nonsense to outright absurdity, becoming serious only when answering questions dealing with their faith. They have made many absurd claims, ranging from the accusations that Blindside&#x27;s members are vampire, werewolf, and zombie hunters, to accusations that Pillar&#x27;s band members are made of grass clippings. Despite the nature of many of these statements, it appears they were meant to be taken in a light-hearted manner.

Very open with their Christianity, the group has even been known to point out that the only serious things they will say during their set are those that deal with their beliefs. Showbread also gives whimsical names to their headlining tours like &quot;Kings Of Krunk&quot; and &quot;To&#x27;...Fo&#x27; Sho&#x27;&quot; and even reportedly suggested that their 2006 tour with the band Roses Are Red be titled &quot;Dookie Eaters Anonymous,&quot; due to a recurring joke between vocalists Mobley and Porter.

They are known for wearing matching outfits when performing to promote their albums, such as red and black for &quot;No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical&quot;, black and green for &quot;Age of Reptiles&quot;, Doctor and Nurse outfits for &quot;Anorexia&quot; and &quot;Nervosa&quot;, and army shirts for &quot;The Fear of God&quot;.

== Ideological views ==
Showbread openly advocate Christian pacifism and anarchism, criticize patriotism as idolatry, boycott all companies that use sweatshops, all members are freewill theists, some subscribe to open theism and all members are teetotalers.

== Controversies ==
Despite their open statements concerning their Christian faith, Showbread has endured intense criticism from some Christians who feel certain aspects of their music to be offensive and repugnant in terms of Christian morality.

In 2006, a fan-made video for the song &quot;Dead By Dawn&quot;, featured on YouTube, was seen by the band and posted on their own site. In turn, this video was misinterpreted by some as an actual Showbread music video which brought attention to the subject matter and lyrics of &quot;Dead By Dawn&quot;. Certain Christian groups retaliated on web forums calling the band &quot;satanic&quot; and insisting that &quot;the only reason these degenerates should be allowed in a church is if it is to get them saved&quot;. The album, No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical, was even briefly pulled from some Christian music retailers in the wake of the backlash. However, upon further investigation of the accusations and those that made them, the album was restocked and the controversy dismissed. After a period of silence, on September 7, 2006, the band reposted (after their website crashed) a statement on their site discussing the debate between Christian morality and secular media in defense of their music and the beliefs they stand for. From the statement, Josh Porter concluded with:
&quot;Showbread is a Christian band. As I tell you from the stage in dark musty concert venues each night, dressed in silly outfits, covered in sweat and in a tired voice. This means that we as a band believe in Jesus Christ, we believe the Bible to be the living word of God, we believe in love.&quot;

Despite their blatant evangelical and biblical messages, Showbread&#x27;s albums &quot;Anorexia&quot; and &quot;Nervosa&quot; were banned from Christian retail outlets because of the overall &quot;dark&quot; nature of much of the story and scenes involving rape, animal cruelty and abortion.

In the late July/August 2009, not long before the release of &quot;The Fear of God&quot;, the band was the subject of controversy among certain Catholics who found the band&#x27;s depiction of a pope on the album cover to be offensive. Josh Dies addressed these concerns on the band&#x27;s Wordpress blog.

<doc id="1171493" wikidata="Q3395459" url="?curid=1171493" title="Shuttle diplomacy">
<text>In diplomacy and international relations, shuttle diplomacy is the action of an outside party in serving as an intermediary between (or among) principals in a dispute, without direct principal-to-principal contact. Originally and usually, the process entails successive travel (&quot;shuttling&quot;) by the intermediary, from the working location of one principal, to that of another. 

The term was first applied to describe the efforts of United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, beginning November 5, 1973, which facilitated the cessation of hostilities following the Yom Kippur War. 

Negotiators often use shuttle diplomacy when one or both of two principals refuses recognition of the other prior to mutually desired negotiation.

Mediators have adopted the term &quot;shuttle diplomacy&quot; as well.

== Examples ==
An early form of shuttle diplomacy emerged at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 when Italy briefly withdrew from the Conference in protest of the other international delegations&#x27; refusal to grant its irredentist territorial claims promised by the Treaty of London in 1915. Upon Italy&#x27;s return, Colonel Edward House of the U.S. delegation attempted to solve its conflict with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes by placing the two countries&#x27; delegates in separate rooms and attempting to broker a compromise between the two. House&#x27;s efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the collapse of Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando&#x27;s government in Rome and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s takeover of Fiume. 

Kissinger continued to participate in shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East during the Nixon and Ford administrations (1969–1977); it resulted in the Sinai Interim Agreement (1975) and arrangements between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights (1974). The term became widespread during Kissinger&#x27;s service as Secretary of State. 

Soon after Kissinger&#x27;s efforts, shuttle diplomacy came to the United States in the form of Israel and Egypt conducting negotiations at Camp David. The negotiations were successfully facilitated by President Jimmy Carter. 

Turkey has carried out shuttle diplomacy, often involving Israel: Turkey was Israel&#x27;s closest ally in the Muslim world, and some Arab countries (notably Syria, which has common borders with both Turkey and Israel) have been amenable to Turkey, with its own Muslim majority population. Another Turkish mediation took place between Russia and Georgia during their war in 2008.

US Secretary of State Alexander Haig attempted to use shuttle diplomacy to mediate between the United Kingdom and Argentina during the Falklands War in 1982.

French president Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s shuttle diplomacy was unsuccessful in preventing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Angus Loughran (born 24 November 1966) is a British sports commentator and pundit. He appears regularly on television, newspapers and websites, usually concentrating on horse racing and football, such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and online bookmaker Easyodds, writing tipping sections every day. He has also provided English language football commentary for Eurosport and ESPN. He is currently a commentator for BT Sport on their coverage of the Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.

He first worked for Ladbrokes, providing racing commentary into their betting shops, but rose to fame as &quot;Statto&quot;, the resident statistician on the BBC Two television show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;. Clad in a dressing gown and pyjamas, he would stand in the corner of the set and provide facts and figures on each of the guests&#x27; fantasy football teams, while being made fun of by hosts Frank Skinner and David Baddiel. He also appeared in the Rowan Atkinson comedy film &quot;Bean&quot; in 1997 and the Mel Smith directed &quot;Blackball&quot; in 2003.

He is the son of conductor James Loughran and was educated at Ampleforth College. He is a fan of Manchester United F.C.

As a 15-year-old, Loughran was involved in an elaborate prank on Chris Tavaré during a cricket Test match:
&quot;The crowd of just 1,444 showed their disgust, crying &quot;boring, boring, boring&quot; repeatedly as Tavaré and England continued to bat on and on. Before too long, a 15-year-old boy appeared at the wicket holding a stool, apparently indicating to the batsman that he must need a rest after batting for such a long time.

The boy in question was the young Angus Loughran, or Fantasy Football&#x27;s Statto as he would later become known. The interruption entertained the agitated fans, and even amused officials so much that Loughran was offered life membership to the Oval. And he also made a profit during his one-man protest.

His friends, thinking reasonably that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to pull off such a stunt, invested in Loughran&#x27;s bet, meaning that there was £300 riding on the wager. &quot;I figured I&#x27;d probably be arrested but the fine would only be £100, so I&#x27;d still be £200 up,&quot; Loughran later revealed, showing a nose for a money-making scheme even from an early age.&quot;

He was declared bankrupt at a hearing at Manchester County Court on 4 February 2008 due to large debts owed to Sporting Index. The bankruptcy was annulled in April 2008 when he presented an IVA to his creditors.

<doc id="1171498" wikidata="Q2789346" url="?curid=1171498" title="USS Hawkbill (SS-366)">
<text>USS &quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SS-366), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hawksbill, a large sea turtle (the &quot;-s-&quot; was inadvertently dropped at commissioning.).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SS-366) was launched by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 9 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. F. W. Scanland, Jr., and commissioned on 17 May 1944.

==Operational history==
Following a period of training on the Great Lakes, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; departed 1 June 1944 from Manitowoc to begin the long journey down the Illinois River and finally by barge down the Mississippi. She arrived New Orleans 10 June and, after combat loading, sailed 16 June for training based at the submarine base at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. On 18 June 1944, the 5,433-gross register ton Panamamanian merchant ship mistook her for a German U-boat and opened gunfire on her in the Caribbean Sea about south of Cape San Antonio, Cuba, at , firing six rounds. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; signaled &quot;White Clover&quot; to cease firing and suffered no casualties or damage.

After completing her training from Balboa, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 July 1944 for final preparations before her first war patrol.

===First and Second War Patrols===

Departing 23 August, the submarine steamed via Saipan to her patrol area in the Philippine Islands in company with and . In October Hawkbill shifted patrol to the South China Sea and, while approaching two carriers 7 October, was forced down by violent depth charging by Japanese destroyers. Two days later she attacked a 12-ship convoy with &quot;Becuna&quot;, damaging several of the ships. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; transited heavily patrolled Lombok Strait 14 October, and terminated her first patrol at Fremantle, Australia on 17 October.

In company with &quot;Becuna&quot; and , the submarine departed for her second patrol 15 November bound for the area north of the Malay Barrier. She encountered a convoy 15 December and sank destroyer &quot;Momo&quot; with six well-placed torpedoes during a night attack. Finding few contacts—a testament to the effectiveness of the American submarines—&quot;Hawkbill&quot; headed once more for Lombok Strait. This time she was sighted by a patrol craft, but cleverly maneuvered into a rain squall. The submarine was then fired-upon by shore batteries before passing out of range. Hawkbill returned to Fremantle 5 January 1945.

===Third and Fourth War Patrols===

On her third war patrol beginning 5 February, the submarine returned to Lombok Strait to turn the tables on her former pursuers. Her torpedoes sank two submarine chasers 14 February, and she added some small craft before turning for the South China Sea. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; detected a convoy 20 February; after engaging one escort with gunfire, she sank 5,400-ton cargo ship &quot;Daizen Maru&quot; with a spread of torpedoes. The rest of her patrol brought no targets; she arrived Fremantle 6 April 1945.

Departing on her fourth patrol 5 May, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; served on lifeguard station for a B-24 strike on the Kangean Islands north of Bali. She arrived 16 May on her patrol station off the coast of Malaya, and soon afterward encountered minelayer &quot;Hatsutaka&quot; heading south along the coast. She attacked and obtained two hits, causing severe damage. The ship was observed next morning being towed to the beach. At a range of almost , &quot;Hawkbill&quot; fired three more torpedoes into the shallow waters and broke the ship in half, sinking a familiar enemy of submarines operating on the Malayan coast. After further patrol off Malaya and in the Gulf of Siam, she arrived Subic Bay 18 June 1945.

===Fifth War Patrol and Japanese Surrender===

&quot;Hawkbill&quot; departed for her fifth and last war patrol 12 July. Returning to the coast of Malaya, she attacked a convoy 18 July. Her first torpedoes missed, and an hour later a depth charge attack of unusual accuracy and intensity began from the destroyer Kamikaze. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; was blown partially out of the water by a perfectly placed pattern and damaged considerably; but by hugging the bottom with all machinery secured, she eluded the attacking destroyer. After a stay at Subic Bay for repairs, she steamed to Borneo to rendezvous with Australian Army officers for a special mission. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; destroyed two radio stations with her deck guns, landed commandos at Terampha Town, and destroyed shore installations. After reconnaissance of the Anambas Islands, also in the South China Sea, the versatile submarine returned to Borneo 13 August.

Following the surrender of Japan, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor, departing 22 September 1945 for San Francisco. She decommissioned at Mare Island 30 September 1946 and joined the Reserve Fleet. Brought out of reserve in 1952, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; was given a GUPPY IB conversion and loaned to the Netherlands under the Military Assistance Program 21 April 1953.

=== HNLMS &quot;Zeeleeuw&quot; (S803) ===

The submarine was commissioned in the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS &quot;Zeeleeuw&quot; (S803), the first Dutch naval ship to be named for the sealion. &quot;Zeeleeuw&quot; reached Rotterdam 11 June, in time to participate successfully in NATO summer exercises, &#x27;beating&#x27; the Royal Navy as well as the U.S. Navy. On 24 November 1970, &quot;Zeeleeuw&quot; was sold for scrap.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Hawkbill&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service. All five of her war patrols were designated &quot;successful,&quot; and she received a Navy Unit Commendation for her outstanding performance on patrols 1, 3, and 4.

<text>Dave Couse (born 1965) is an Irish musician, producer, and radio presenter best known for being the lead singer and main songwriter with the band A House.

Couse has also released three albums as a solo artist.

==Early career and A House==
Couse was born in Perrystown, Dublin in 1965. He met some of his future bandmates while attending school in Templeogue College and formed the band Last Chance.

The disintegration of Last Chance gave birth to A House which consisted of Couse on vocals and guitar, Martin Healy on bass, Dermot Wylie on drums, and Fergal Bunbury on guitar. A House&#x27;s earliest appearance on record appears on &quot;Live at the Underground&quot; (UK, 1986) alongside other up and coming bands such as Something Happens and The Stars of Heaven, while their first single release was &quot;Kick Me Again Jesus&quot; in 1987. The band would endure for over a decade, during all of which time Couse, Healy, and Bunbury remained as core members. Bunbury still frequently collaborates with Couse.

A House released five albums, as well as singles and EPs. After their second album, &quot;I Want Too Much&quot;, released in 1990, the band were dropped by their label, Blanco y Negro Records, and picked up by Setanta Records. As well as enabling A House to continue, this signing led to Couse developing a strong collaborative and personal bond with Edwyn Collins, and to an enduring relationship also with The Frank and Walters, all of whom were with Setanta at that time. A House never experienced more than sporadic commercial success and eventually decided to call it quits in 1997, bowing out with a farewell concert at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin in February.

==1997 to 2003==
After the break-up of A House an apparent hiatus followed for Couse. In fact, he was working on several collaborative projects. The detailed A House and Dave Couse discography at ZOP states that Couse and Bunbury worked on a project together in 2000, under the name &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;, recording an unreleased album titled &quot;the eighteenth Sunday in ordinary time&quot;, and that Couse also produced an album&#x27;s worth of material with Briana Corrigan, formerly of the Beautiful South. However, almost none of Couse&#x27;s work from this period has ever seen the light of day. The exception is one single by Lokomotiv, &quot;Next Time Round&quot; (UK, 2000) which featured Corrigan on backing vocals on the A-side, and Úna O Boyle of ambient-trance-dance band Hyper[borea] on lead vocals on the B-side, &quot;Intercourse with the World&quot;.

Otherwise, Couse was not much heard of until 2002 when a retrospective A House compilation (&quot;The Way We Were&quot;) was released, and the A House/Couse song Here Come the Good Times was successfully re-recorded as a charity single by members of the Irish soccer squad and other Irish celebrities in the run up to the 2002 World Cup.

==Solo musical career==

===Genes===
In 2003, his first solo record was released. This was &quot;Genes&quot;, which appeared on Couse&#x27;s own label, Beep-Beep. Recorded with production help from Edwyn Collins, the record is self-described as a &quot;somewhat introspective affair&quot;. The production received some criticism, especially for losing Couse&#x27;s lyrics in its murky sound, but the album&#x27;s real difficulty lay in its thematic focus on the death of Couse&#x27;s father, leading to a morose atmosphere that was not always musically successful. Couse said later that he had not been fully ready to deal with his fresh grief while working on the album, so it is perhaps not surprising that the record&#x27;s highlight for many is a powerful version of someone else&#x27;s song about attachment and loss, John Cale&#x27;s Close Watch. The album artwork features photos of Couse and of his father (and its title is self-evident). Despite its problematic nature, there were positive reviews for &quot;Genes&quot; in Ireland, some even commenting on Couse&#x27;s continuing ability to write perkily askew, breezy pop songs. In live performances at this time Couse was usually accompanied by Simon Quigley on keyboards.

&quot;Genes&quot; did not sell very well and Couse was dispirited, as his live gigging had not been particularly successful either. He had thought that as a solo artist he would pick up something of an instant audience from the body of A House fans, but this did not work out because of the apparently fallow period before 2003, although he had received a fillip through the 2002 releases of &quot;The Way We Were&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Good Times&quot;. Then &quot;Genes&quot; was a record defined by Couse&#x27;s personal need to deal with depression stemming from career uncertainty and his father&#x27;s death, as well as more optimistic but overwhelming events, like the birth of his daughter. However, by 2005 Couse was ready to meet the world again, and in October he released &quot;The World Should Know&quot;.

===The World Should Know===
Recorded with a band, &quot;The World Should Know&quot; is officially credited to Couse and The Impossible. More user-friendly and with a bigger, catchier sound than &quot;Genes&quot;, it was nominated for &quot;Best Album&quot; at the 2006 Meteor Awards and Couse was nominated for &quot;Best Irish Male&quot;. The record went on to a get full UK release and spawned a number of singles. The line up of Couse and The Impossible was Couse on vocals and guitar with Simon Quigley (keyboards), Mike O&#x27;Dowd (drums), Pete Meighan (guitar), and Dave Flynn (Bass Guitar); the group had broken up by 2007.

One of the singles from &quot;The World Should Know&quot; was &quot;A Celebration&quot;. Released in 2006, the single also included an updated version of the A House classic &quot;Endless Art&quot;, which replaced the names of the deceased artists in the original with some of those who had passed since the song&#x27;s original appearance in 1990. This limited edition CD is now highly sought after on the Dublin music trading scene.

In 2007 on the 10th anniversary of the final A House concert, Couse and Fergal Bunbury reunited once more for a well-received gig at Dublin&#x27;s Sugar Club. Joined by Rike Soeller on cello, Couse displayed newly honed piano skills whilst treating the audience to a selection of A House/Couse classics in a style that foreshadowed the style eventually to be showcased on the record &quot;Alonewalk&quot;.

===Alonewalk===
On 2 April 2010 Couse released his album &quot;Alonewalk&quot; on Dublin label 1969 Records. One of the songs on &quot;Alonewalk&quot; is titled &quot;Good Friday&quot; which is why the release date of 2 April (Good Friday in 2010) was chosen. The Irish Times described the album as unlikely to appeal to a younger generation because Couse is a &quot;middle-aged maker of music the polar opposite of what passes for pop these days&quot; but because of the lyrical sophistication and honesty of this singular and brave songwriter the record is &quot;so affecting and so good&quot;. Musically it is based in a palette of piano and cello, Couse being again helped out by Bunbury and Soeller. There is also a guest contribution from Cathal Coughlan of The Fatima Mansions, who sings &quot;Good Friday&quot;. &quot;Alonewalk&quot; was mastered by Bob Ludwig.

==Other activities==

===Producer===
Couse also works as a producer, mainly (apart from his own and A House&#x27;s records) for The Frank and Walters, from their album &quot;The Frank and Walters&quot; in 1991, when A House and The Frank and Walters were label mates on Setanta Records, through their 2006 record &quot;A Renewed Interest in Happiness&quot;.

===Radio DJ===
Couse previously presented his own radio show &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; on Irish radio station Today FM every Sunday evening. He tried to approach his &quot;little&quot; show with the excitement of a music fan being allowed to play music to other music fans. The Lighthouse was subsequently axed in March 2014. Despite that, Couse continues to work for Today FM, having stood in for Tom Dunne on Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; when Dunne was off holidays or off covering for another Today FM radio presenter such as Ray D&#x27;arcy or Ian Dempsey. In the 1980s, both Dunne and Couse occupied similar roles in both the Dublin and Irish music scenes, Dunne with Something Happens (band) and Couse with A House. These days, Couse regularly fills in for Dunne&#x27;s replacement, Paul McLoone and who had previously worked as a producer on Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; show on McLoone&#x27;s very popular and highly regarded music show, &quot;The Paul McLoone Show&quot; which airs every Monday- Thursday 9 pm to midnight and which is best known for focusing on sole singers and bands in the alternative and indie rock world. McLoone and Couse have a strong friendship with Couse regularly filling in for McLoone in the event that McLoone is either covering the slot of another Today FM radio presenter, on holidays or off performing gigs with the Northern Irish pop-punk band, The Undertones of which McLoone is the current frontman/vocalist, a position McLoone has held since the band officially reformed in November 1999.

<text>Tecoma is a genus of seven species of shrubs or small trees in the trumpet vine family, Bignoniaceae. They are native to the Americas, ranging from the extreme southern United States through Central America and the Antilles south through Andean South America to northern Argentina. The generic name is derived from the Nahuatl word &quot;tecomaxochitl&quot;, which was applied by the indigenous peoples of Mexico to plants with tubular flowers. Trumpetbush is a common name for plants in this genus.

<text>An assembly hall is a hall to hold public meetings or meetings of an organization such as a school, church, or deliberative assembly. An example of the last case is the Assembly Hall (Washington, Mississippi) where the general assembly of the state of Mississippi was held. Some Christian denominations call their meeting places or places of worship assembly halls. Elders and ministers of Presbyterian churches gather in assembly halls for their general assemblies, such as in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland.

==College and university campuses==

On the campuses of colleges and universities in the United States, assembly halls are sometimes found in multipurpose athletic buildings, where they share other uses, including as basketball courts. Examples are Assembly Hall (Bloomington) and (formerly) Assembly Hall (Champaign).

<doc id="1171506" wikidata="Q1619435" url="?curid=1171506" title="Clue Club">
<text>Clue Club is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and broadcast on CBS from August 14 to December 11, 1976.

==Overview==
The series follows a group of four teenage detectives, the Clue Club – Larry, Pepper, D.D. and Dottie – who solved mysteries with the help of two talking dogs, a bloodhound and basset hound named Woofer and Wimper. Clue Club mysteries usually involved investigating bizarre crimes such as animals, trains, airports, a movie director and statues vanishing into thin air.

&quot;Clue Club&quot; only had one season&#x27;s worth of first-run episodes produced, which were shown on Saturday mornings on CBS.

In the fall of 1977, cut-down versions of the half-hour episodes of &quot;Clue Club&quot; appeared under the new title Woofer &amp; Wimper, Dog Detectives to showcase the show&#x27;s bloodhound and basset hound which aired as a segment on the CBS Saturday morning package program &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; from September 10, 1977, to January 21, 1978. When &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; was cancelled in early 1978, &quot;Woofer &amp; Wimper, Dog Detectives&quot; re-appeared as a segment alongside &quot;The Three Robonic Stooges&quot; on their half-hour show from January 28 to September 2, 1978, also on CBS.

The full-length versions of &quot;Clue Club&quot; returned to CBS on Sunday mornings from September 10, 1978, to January 21, 1979, concluding the show&#x27;s original network run. After a mid-1980s re-airing on USA Cartoon Express, it has since resurfaced on Cartoon Network (as part of the &quot;Mysteries, Inc.&quot; block) in the 1990s and Boomerang in the 2000s.

==Characters==
The series features the following seven main characters throughout its run: 
* Paul Winchell as Woofer, a bloodhound who would constantly accuse suspects without good reason, then later back-track while haughtily proclaiming his genius to satisfy his ego; he also wears a deerstalkers&#x27; cap on his head.
* Jim MacGeorge as Wimper, a more down-to-earth, easy-going, yet intelligent basset hound who would at times go along with Woofer’s schemes, and other times he would turn the tables on his comrade.
* David Jolliffe as Larry, the Club&#x27;s eldest member and de-facto leader; he normally interviewed the suspect(s) and/or passed on their findings to Dottie.
* Patricia Stich as Pepper, Dottie&#x27;s blonde and beautiful elder sister. Pepper searched for clues and/or evidence, mostly accompanied by D.D., which often lead to them being chased by the villains. The sisters&#x27; last name was never revealed. 
* Bob Hastings as D.D., a bespectacled redhead wearing a Sherlock Holmes style hat, he often teamed up with Pepper to search for clues; it was never revealed what D.D.&#x27;s initials stood for.
* Tara Talboy as Dottie, the Club&#x27;s youngest member, at 13 years old, she endured an arsenal of deprecating nicknames from her big sister Pepper and their friends: &quot;half-pint&quot;, &quot;short-stuff&quot; and the like. A prodigy, she normally stayed at home; from there, Dottie provided case-solving information from her minicomputer and/or results from various forensic tests. She also had access to high-tech communications equipment, including audio/video links to the Club&#x27;s car and to their wristwatches, which doubled as pagers. Dottie&#x27;s friends were highly protective of her, and resented it when she joined them in the field...which the girl frequently did, after running out of &quot;homework&quot;.
* John Stephenson as Sheriff Lester Bagley, the local sheriff who frequently relied on the Clue Club for assistance and arrested suspects at their conclusion; story editor Sid Morse&#x27;s series-bible revealed the Sheriff&#x27;s full name.

<doc id="1171508" wikidata="Q219986" url="?curid=1171508" title="Gangkhar Puensum">
<text>Gangkhar Puensum (, alternatively, Gangkar Punsum or Gankar Punzum) is the highest mountain in Bhutan and the highest unclimbed mountain in the world, with an elevation of and a prominence of . In Dzongkha language, its name means &quot;White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers&quot;.

Gangkhar Puensum lies on the border between Bhutan and Tibet. After Bhutan was opened for mountaineering in 1983, there were four expeditions that resulted in failed summit attempts in 1985 and 1986. 

In 1994 Bhutan banned the climbing of peaks over 6,000 metres and since 2003, all mountaineering has been banned in Bhutan.

==History==

The elevation of Gangkhar Puensum was first measured in 1922 but, until recent years, maps of the region were not at all accurate and the mountain was shown in different locations and with markedly different heights. Indeed, because of inadequate mapping, the first team to attempt the summit was unable to find the mountain at all.

The book of the 1986 British expedition gives the mountain&#x27;s height as and states that Gangkhar Puensum is completely inside Bhutan, whereas the nearby Kula Kangri is completely inside Tibet. Kula Kangri, 7,554 metres, is a separate mountain to the northeast which was first climbed in 1986. It is variously mapped and described as being in Tibet or Bhutan.

Since 1994, climbing of mountains in Bhutan above has been prohibited out of respect for local spiritual beliefs. Since 2003, mountaineering has been forbidden completely.

In 1998, a Japanese expedition secured permission from the Chinese Mountaineering Association to climb the mountain, but permission was withdrawn because of a political issue with Bhutan. This resulted in their permit to climb Gangkhar Puensum itself being revoked. Instead, in 1999, the team set off from Tibet and successfully climbed Liankang Kangri (also known as Gangkhar Puensum North), a subsidiary peak (not an independent mountain), separated from the main peak by a ridge to the north-northwest.

Unlike many maps, the expedition&#x27;s report shows this summit as being in Tibet and the Bhutan–China border is shown crossing the summit of Gangkhar Puensum, described as &quot;the highest peak in Bhutan&quot;, at 7,570 metres.

<text>Xerostomia, also known as dry mouth, is a subjective complaint of dryness in the mouth, which may be associated with a change in the composition of saliva, reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.

This symptom is very common and is often seen as a side effect of many types of medication. It is more common in older people (mostly because individuals in this group are more likely to take several medications) and in people who breathe through their mouths. Dehydration, radiotherapy involving the salivary glands, chemotherapy and several diseases can cause reduced salivation (hyposalivation), or a change in saliva consistency and hence a complaint of xerostomia. Sometimes there is no identifiable cause, and there may sometimes be a psychogenic reason for the complaint.

==Definition==
Xerostomia is the subjective sensation of dry mouth, which is often (but not always) associated with hypofunction of the salivary glands. The term is derived from the Greek words ξηρός (&quot;xeros&quot;) meaning &quot;dry&quot; and στόμα (&quot;stoma&quot;) meaning &quot;mouth&quot;. A drug or substance that increases the rate of salivary flow is termed a sialogogue.

Hyposalivation is a clinical diagnosis that is made based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction has been defined as any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5 minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10 minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe the symptom in the absence of any clinical evidence of dryness. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of xerostomia, salivary gland hyposalivation, and hypersalivation.

==Signs and symptoms==

Hyposalivation may give the following signs and symptoms:
* Dental caries (xerostomia related caries) – Without the buffering effects of saliva, tooth decay becomes a common feature and may progress much more aggressively than it would otherwise (&quot;rampant caries&quot;). It may affect tooth surfaces that are normally spared, e.g., cervical caries and root surface caries. This is often seen in patients who have had radiotherapy involving the major salivary glands, termed radiation-induced caries. Therefore, it is important that any products used in managing dry mouth symptoms are sugar-free, as the presence of sugars in the mouth support the growth of oral bacteria, resulting in acid production and development of dental caries.
* Acid erosion. Saliva acts as a buffer and helps to prevent demineralization of teeth. 
* Oral candidiasis – A loss of the antimicrobial actions of saliva may also lead to opportunistic infection with &quot;Candida&quot; species.
* Ascending (suppurative) sialadenitis – an infection of the major salivary glands (usually the parotid gland) that may be recurrent. It is associated with hyposalivation, as bacteria are able to enter the ductal system against the diminished flow of saliva. There may be swollen salivary glands even without acute infection, possibly caused by autoimmune involvement.
* Dysgeusia – altered taste sensation (e.g., a metallic taste) and dysosmia, altered sense of smell.
* Intraoral halitosis – possibly due to increased activity of halitogenic biofilm on the posterior dorsal tongue (although dysgeusia may cause a complaint of nongenuine halitosis in the absence of hyposalivation).
* Burning mouth syndrome – a burning or tingling sensation in the mouth.
* Saliva that appears thick or ropey.
* Mucosa that appears dry.
* A lack of saliva pooling in the floor of the mouth during examination.
* Dysphagia – difficulty swallowing and chewing, especially when eating dry foods. Food may stick to the tissues during eating.
* The tongue may stick to the palate, causing a clicking noise during speech, or the lips may stick together.
* Gloves or a dental mirror may stick to the tissues.
* Fissured tongue with atrophy of the filiform papillae and a lobulated, erythematous appearance of the tongue.
* Saliva cannot be &quot;milked&quot; (expressed) from the parotid duct.
* Difficulty wearing dentures, e.g., when swallowing or speaking. There may be generalized mucosal soreness and ulceration of the areas covered by the denture.
* Mouth soreness and oral mucositis.
* Lipstick or food may stick to the teeth.
* A need to sip drinks frequently while talking or eating.
* Dry, sore, and cracked lips and angles of mouth.
* Thirst.

However, sometimes the clinical findings do not correlate with the symptoms experienced. For example, a person with signs of hyposalivation may not complain of xerostomia. Conversely a person who reports experiencing xerostomia may not show signs of reduced salivary secretions (subjective xerostomia). In the latter scenario, there are often other oral symptoms suggestive of oral dysesthesia (&quot;burning mouth syndrome&quot;). Some symptoms outside the mouth may occur together with xerostomia.

These include:
* Xerophthalmia (dry eyes).
* Inability to cry.
* Blurred vision.
* Photophobia (light intolerance).
* Dryness of other mucosae, e.g., nasal, laryngeal, and/or genital.
* Burning sensation.
* Itching or grittiness.
* Dysphonia (voice changes).

There may also be other systemic signs and symptoms if there is an underlying cause such as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, for example, joint pain due to associated rheumatoid arthritis.

==Cause==
The differential of hyposalivation significantly overlaps with that of xerostomia. A reduction in saliva production to about 50% of the normal unstimulated level will usually result in the sensation of dry mouth. Altered saliva composition may also be responsible for xerostomia.

===Physiological===
Salivary flow rate is decreased during sleep, which may lead to a transient sensation of dry mouth upon waking. This disappears with eating or drinking or with oral hygiene. When associated with halitosis, this is sometimes termed &quot;morning breath&quot;. Dry mouth is also a common sensation during periods of anxiety, probably owing to enhanced sympathetic drive. During periods of stress, our body responds in a ‘fight or flight’ state that will interfere with the saliva flow in the mouth. Dehydration is known to cause hyposalivation, the result of the body trying to conserve fluid. Physiologic age-related changes in salivary gland tissues may lead to a modest reduction in salivary output and partially explain the increased prevalence of xerostomia in older people. However, polypharmacy is thought to be the major cause in this group, with no significant decreases in salivary flow rate being likely to occur through aging alone.

===Drug induced xerostomia===
Aside from physiological causes of xerostomia, iatrogenic effects of medications are the most common cause. A medication which is known to cause xerostomia may be termed &quot;xerogenic&quot;. Over 400 medications are associated with xerostomia. Although drug induced xerostomia is commonly reversible, the conditions for which these medications are prescribed are frequently chronic. The likelihood of xerostomia increases in relation to the total number of medications taken, whether the individual medications are xerogenic or not. The sensation of dryness usually starts shortly after starting the offending medication or after increasing the dose. Anticholinergic, sympathomimetic, or diuretic drugs are usually responsible.

===Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome===

Xerostomia may be caused by autoimmune conditions which damage saliva-producing cells. Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is one such disease, and it is associated with symptoms including fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia. The disease is characterised by inflammatory changes in the moisture-producing glands throughout the body, leading to reduced secretions from glands that produce saliva, tears and other secretions throughout the body. Primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is identical to primary form but with the addition of a combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.

===Celiac disease===

Xerostomia may be the only symptom of celiac disease, especially in adults, who often have no obvious digestive symptoms.

===Radiation therapy===

Radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck (including brachytherapy for thyroid cancers) where the salivary glands are close to or within the field irradiated is another major cause of xerostomia. A radiation dose of 52 Gy is sufficient to cause severe salivary dysfunction. Radiotherapy for oral cancers usually involves up to 70 Gy of radiation, often given along with chemotherapy which may also have a damaging effect on saliva production. This side effect is a result of radiation damage of the parasympathetic nerves. Formation of salivary gland ducts depends on the secretion of a neuropeptide from the parasympathetic nerves, while development of the end buds of the salivary gland depends on acetylcholine from the parasympathetic nerves.

===Sicca syndrome===
&quot;Sicca&quot; simply means dryness. Sicca syndrome is not a specific condition, and there are varying definitions, but the term can describe oral and eye dryness that is not caused by autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjögren syndrome).

===Other causes===
Oral dryness may also be caused by mouth breathing, usually caused by partial obstruction of the upper respiratory tract. Examples include hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.

Alcohol may be involved in the cause of salivary gland disease, liver disease, or dehydration.

Smoking is another possible cause. Other recreational drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, or heroin, may be implicated.

Hormonal disorders, such as poorly controlled diabetes, chronic graft versus host disease or low fluid intake in people undergoing hemodialysis for renal impairment may also result in xerostomia, due to dehydration.

Nerve damage can be a cause of oral dryness. An injury to the face or surgery can cause nerve damage to the head and neck area which can effect the nerves that are associated with the salivary flow.

Xerostomia may be a consequence of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a rare cause of salivary gland dysfunction may be sarcoidosis.

Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) can cause a related salivary gland disease known as Diffuse Infiltrative Lymphocytosis Syndrome (DILS).

Similar to taste dysfunction, xerostomia is one of the most prevalent and persistent oral symptoms associated with COVID-19. Despite a close association with COVID-19, xerostomia, dry mouth and hyposalivation tend to be overlooked in COVID-19 patients and survivors, unlike ageusia, dysgeusia and hypogeusia.

==Diagnostic approach==
A diagnosis of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. The Challacombe scale maybe used to classify the extent of dryness. The rate of the salivary flow in an individual&#x27;s mouth can also be measured. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test is simple and noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows from one of the parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.

==Treatment==

The successful treatment of xerostomia is difficult to achieve and often unsatisfactory. This involves finding any correctable cause and removing it if possible, but in many cases it is not possible to correct the xerostomia itself, and treatment is symptomatic, and also focuses on preventing tooth decay through improving oral hygiene. Where the symptom is caused by hyposalivation secondary to underlying chronic disease, xerostomia can be considered permanent or even progressive. The management of salivary gland dysfunction may involve the use of saliva substitutes and/or saliva stimulants:

* Saliva substitutes – These are viscous products which are applied to the oral mucosa, which can be found in the form of sprays, gels, oils, mouthwashes, mouth rinses, pastilles or viscous liquids. This includes water, artificial salivas (mucin-based, carboxymethylcellulose-based), and other substances (milk, vegetable oil):
** Mucin Spray: 4 Trials have been completed on the effects of Mucin Spray on Xerostomia, overall there is no strong evidence showing that Mucin Spray is more effective than a placebo in reducing the symptoms of dry mouth.
** Mucin Lozenge: Only 1 trial (Gravenmade 1993) has been completed regarding the effectiveness of Mucin Lozenges. Whilst it was assessed as being at high risk of bias, it showed that Mucin Lozenges were ineffective when compared to a placebo.
** Mucoadhesive Disk: These disks are stuck to the palate and they contain lubricating agents, flavouring agents and some antimicrobial agents. One trial (Kerr 2010) assessed their effectiveness against a placebo disk. Strangely, patients from both groups (placebo and the real disk) reported an increase in subjective oral moistness. No adverse effects were reported. More research is needed in this area before conclusions are drawn.
* Biotene oral Balance Gel &amp; toothpaste: One trial has been completed (Epstein 1999) regarding the effectiveness of Biotene Oral Balance gel &amp; toothpaste. The results showed that Biotene products were &quot;more effective than control and reduced dry mouth on waking&quot;.
* Saliva stimulants – organic acids (ascorbic acid, malic acid), chewing gum, parasympathomimetic drugs (choline esters, e.g. pilocarpine hydrochloride, cholinesterase inhibitors), and other substances (sugar-free mints, nicotinamide). Medications which stimulate saliva production traditionally have been administered through oral tablets, which the patient goes on to swallow, although some saliva stimulants can also be found in the form of toothpastes. Lozenges, which are retained in the mouth and then swallowed are becoming more and more popular. Lozenges are soft and gentle on the mouth and there is a belief that prolonged contact with the oral mucosa mechanically stimulates saliva production. 
** Pilocarpine: A study by Taweechaisupapong in 2006 showed no &#x27;statistical significant improvement in oral dryness and saliva production compared to placebo&#x27; when administering pilocarpine lozenges.
** Physostigmine Gel: A study by Knosravini in 2009 showed a reduction in the oral dryness and a 5 times increase in saliva following physostigmine treatment. 
** Chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves dry mouth symptoms.
** The Cochrane oral health group concluded &#x27;there is insufficient evidence to determine whether pilocarpine or physostigmine&#x27; are effective treatments for Xerostomia. More research is needed.
** Dentirol chewing gum (xylitol): A study by Risheim in 1993 showed that when subjects had 2 sticks of gum up to 5 x daily, the gum gave subjective dry mouth symptom relief in approximately 1/3 of participants but no change in SWS (stimulated whole saliva).
**Profylin lozenge (xylitol/sorbitol):A study by Risheim in 1993 showed that when subjects had 1 lozenge 4 to 8 x daily, Profylin lozenges gave subjective dry mouth symptom relief in approximately 1/3 of participants but no change in SWS (stimulated whole saliva).

Saliva substitutes can improve xerostomia, but tend not to improve the other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction. Parasympathomimetic drugs (saliva stimulants) such as pilocarpine may improve xerostomia symptoms and other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction, but the evidence for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia is limited. Both stimulants and substitutes relieve symptoms to some extent. Salivary stimulants are probably only useful in people with some remaining detectable salivary function. A systematic review compromising of 36 randomised controlled trials for the treatment of dry mouth found that there was no strong evidence to suggest that a specific topical therapy is effective. This review also states that topical therapies can be expected to provide only short-term effects, which are reversible. The review reported limited evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester spray was more effective than electrolyte sprays. Sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves symptoms. Plus, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether chewing gum is more or less effective as a treatment. There is a suggestion that intraoral devices and integrated mouthcare systems may be effective in reducing symptoms, but there was a lack of strong evidence. A systematic review of the management of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia with parasympathomimetic drugs found that there was limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. It was suggested that, barring any contraindications, a trial of the drug be offered in the above group (at a dose of five mg three times per day to minimize side effects). Improvements can take up to twelve weeks. However, pilocarpine is not always successful in improving xerostomia symptoms. The review also concluded that there was little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetics in this group. Another systematic review showed, that there is some low-quality evidence to suggest that amifostine prevents the feeling of dry mouth or reduce the risk of moderate to severe xerostomia in people receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck (with or without chemotherapy) in the short- (end of radiotherapy) to medium-term (three months postradiotherapy). But, it is less clear whether or not this effect is sustained to 12 months postradiotherapy.

A 2013 review looking at non-pharmacological interventions reported a lack of evidence to support the effects of electrostimulation devices, or acupuncture, on symptoms of dry mouth.

==Epidemiology==
Xerostomia is a very common symptom. A conservative estimate of prevalence is about 20% in the general population, with increased prevalences in females (up to 30%) and the elderly (up to 50%). Estimates of the prevalence of persistent dry mouth vary between 10 and 50%. 

==History==
Xerostomia has been used as a test to detect lies, which relied on emotional inhibition of salivary secretions to indicate possible incrimination.

<doc id="1171525" wikidata="Q355975" url="?curid=1171525" title="Versatile Multilayer Disc">
<text>Versatile Multilayer Disc (VMD or HD VMD) was a high-capacity red-laser optical disc technology designed by New Medium Enterprises, Inc. VMD was intended to compete with the blue-laser Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD formats and had an initial capacity of up to 30 GB per side.
At a physical level, VMD is identical to DVD, but with the possibility of using more layers.

==History==
The company founded in Nevada as Shopoverseas.com on August 2, 1999, changed its name to New Medium Enterprises, Inc. (NME) on July 10, 2000.
On April 20, 2001, it became a public company, with shares traded over-the-counter with symbol MNEN.
On January 13, 2004 it acquired the intellectual property for multi-layer optical discs from MultiDisc Ltd. and TriGM International S.A, and became headquartered in London.
On June 14, 2005, Rupert Snow became chairman, and Mahesh Jayanarayan became chief executive officer, replacing interim CEO Irene Kuan.
On July 1, 2005, Eugene Levich was appointed chief technical officer of NME. Levich had a long history of developing multi-layer formats, such as the fluorescent multilayer disc of Constellation 3D.

In December 2005, NME announced an agreement with Chinese-based company E-World which was developing a similar format called Enhanced Versatile Disc.
At CeBIT in March 2006, NME demonstrated a prototype VMD player and announced that it was expecting to launch the format in the third quarter of 2006.
NME claimed 100 titles would be available in 2006.

At the Custom Electronic Design &amp; Installation Association trade show in September 2007, NME exhibited two players set for release in October 2007. Twenty US titles were available at launch time, including some from Icon Productions, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, New Line Cinema, DreamWorks SKG, Lionsgate and The Weinstein Company. NME also signed a deal with Bollywood production company &quot;Eros Group&quot; who intended to release 50 Bollywood features on the format.

The two initial players to be released were the ML622S and the ML777S. The ML777S included USB ports for connection to external storage devices and a media card reader.

The manufacturers hoped to sell the format as a lower cost alternative to other optical technologies.
However, the Great Recession of 2008 struck about this time, and NME struggled to stay in business.

On June 13, 2008 Geoffrey Russell, the interim chief executive officer of New Medium Enterprises, Inc., notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission that the company would be terminating the registration of the company, and that NMEN would cease filing reports with the SEC. The date of effect of this action was 90 days after 12 June 2008. In August 2008 in the UK, New Medium Electronics Limited, New Medium Entertainment Limited and New Medium Optics Limited notified Companies House of their applications for voluntary striking-off.

In October 2008, the technology behind HD-VMD was revived by companies Royal Digital Media, Anthem Digital and DreamStream to produce a new 100 GB optical disc. Anthem Digital&#x27;s chairman Michael Jay Solomon was the former chairman of New Medium Enterprises. As of December 2010, Royal Digital Media, Anthem Digital and DreamStream web sites were no longer available.

==Technical specifications==

===Disc format===
The format uses approximately 5 GB per layer, which was similar to standard DVDs. Standard VMDs can use 4 layers, for 20 GB of storage. The rarer 8 and 10 layered discs store 40 GB to 50 GB, respectively. One manufacturer listed up to 20 layers on a disc being possible in the future.

The Blu-ray Disc uses a blue-violet laser, rather than VMD&#x27;s red laser, which means Blu-ray can store more information per layer. This format has so far only utilized 1 and 2-layered versions. In January 2007, Toshiba announced development on a triple layer HD DVD (TL51) that would have had a capacity of 51 GB. Hitachi announced a 4 and 6 layer version of Blu-ray as well, capable of 100 GB and 200 GB respectively. A standard 4-layer VMD stored 20 GB, which was comparable to a 1-layered HD DVD (15 GB) and 1-layer Blu-ray Disc (25 GB).

===Content format===

The HD VMD format is capable of high-definition video resolutions up to 1080p which is comparable with Blu-ray and HD DVD. Video is encoded in MPEG-2 and VC-1 formats at a maximum bitrate of 40 Megabits per second. This falls between the maximum bitrates of HD DVD (36 Mbit/s) and Blu-ray (48 Mbit/s). There was the possibility that VMD discs could be encoded with the H.264 format in the future. 

The HD VMD format supports up to 7.1-channel Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and DTS audio output, though it does not offer Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound codecs.

<text>Witzenhausen is a small town in the Werra-Meißner-Kreis in northeastern Hesse, Germany.

It was granted town rights in 1225, and until 1974 was a district seat.

The University of Kassel maintains a satellite campus in Witzenhausen, which offers an ecological agricultural sciences programme, putting Witzenhausen among Germany&#x27;s smallest university towns. There is also a teaching institute (DEULA) for environment and technology, agriculture, horticulture and landscaping. The town is nationally known for the invention of the &quot;Biotonne&quot; biological refuse container, and is an important cherry-growing area, with a yearly &quot;Kesperkirmes&quot; or “Cherry Fair” (&quot;Kesper&quot; is a regional name for the cherry), at which a Cherry Queen (&quot;Kirschenkönigin&quot;) is chosen.

==Geography==

===Location===
Witzenhausen lies on the northeast slope of the Kaufunger Wald, which is surrounded by the Meißner-Kaufunger Wald Nature Park. The town is found at the mouth of the Gelster, where it empties into the Werra some 30 km east of Kassel, 16 km east-southeast of Hann. Münden, 25 km south of Göttingen and 23 km northwest of Eschwege.

===Neighbouring communities===
Witzenhausen borders in the north on the town of Hann. Münden, the communities of Rosdorf and Friedland (all three in Lower Saxony&#x27;s Göttingen district), in the east on the communities of Neu-Eichenberg (in the Werra-Meißner-Kreis), Bornhagen and Lindewerra (both in Thuringia’s Eichsfeld district), in the south on the towns of Bad Sooden-Allendorf and Großalmerode and the unincorporated area of Gutsbezirk Kaufunger Wald (all three in the Werra-Meißner-Kreis) and in the west on the community of Staufenberg in Lower Saxony’s Göttingen district.

===Constituent communities===
Witzenhausen’s 16 &quot;Stadtteile&quot;, besides the main town, also called Witzenhausen, are, on the Werra’s left bank:
*Blickershausen (293 inhabitants), 
*Dohrenbach (657 inhabitants), 
*Ellingerode (344 inhabitants), 
*Ermschwerd (1189 inhabitants),

==History==

In 1898, the &quot;Deutsche Kolonialschule für Landwirtschaft, Handel und Gewerbe&quot; (“German Colonial School for Agriculture, Trade and Industry”, also called the &quot;Tropenschule&quot;, or “Tropical School”) was founded to train people in agriculture for resettlement in Germany&#x27;s colonies. The successor institution forms today a satellite campus of the University of Kassel, and includes a greenhouse complex dedicated to tropical crops (the Gewächshaus für tropische Nutzpflanzen).

==Economy and infrastructure==
Witzenhausen suffers – like the whole Werra-Meißner-Kreis and a great part of North Hesse – from extremely high unemployment and its attendant loss of younger people to migration.

In Witzenhausen-Unterrieden, the last producer of chewing tobacco in Germany is still in business. An important employer in Witzenhausen is, with 430 employees all together, the corporation Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA). In Witzenhausen the SCA produces raw paper for corrugated cardboard for manufacturing packagings (SCA Packaging Containerboard) and hygiene products such as toilet paper (SCA Hygiene Products). Another important employer is the district and town hospital in Witzenhausen.

Witzenhausen is domicile of Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen (GEH, the society for the conservation of old and endangered livestock breeds).

===Transport===

Over &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 27 (Göttingen–Eschwege), 80 (Hann. Münden–Heiligenstadt) and 451 (Helsa–Witzenhausen), the town is linked to the greater road network. In Hedemünden, some 10 km away, is an interchange on the Autobahn A 7 (Flensburg–Füssen). Near Friedland is an interchange on the A 38 towards Halle. Moreover, Witzenhausen is on the two tourist routes: the German Timber-Frame Road (&quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot;) and the German Fairy Tale Route (&quot;Deutsche Märchenstraße&quot;).

Witzenhausen has a railway station, Witzenhausen Nord, on the Eichenberg–Kassel section of the Halle-Kassel Railway. It is located above the town on the north slope of the Werra valley and is served by trains to Kassel, Göttingen, Erfurt and Halle. The former Witzenhausen Süd station stood southeast of the inner town and has been closed, like the whole of the Gelster Valley Railway between Eichenberg and –Großalmerode.

The outlying centre of Gertenbach has a further stop on the Halle-Kassel railway

==Town partnerships==
Witzenhausen is twinned with:
* Saint-Vallier, France, since 1975
* Vignola, Italy, since 1995
* Filton, United Kingdom, since 1978
* Kayunga, Uganda, since 2001

Since 1979, Filton, St. Vallier and Witzenhausen have had a three-way partnership.

Between Witzenhausen and Filton, and between Witzenhausen and St. Vallier, there are regular student exchanges with the local comprehensive school. The partnership between Witzenhausen and St. Vallier came about by accident. St. Vallier&#x27;s mayor&#x27;s last name at the time was Witzenhausen, and when, on a visit to Germany, he spotted this name on a road sign, he drove to the town. Out of his visit sprang the partnership, which has lasted to this day.

Furthermore, there have been school exchanges between Witzenhausen and these two places since 2002:
* 100 Mile House, Canada (between the comprehensive school and the secondary school there)
* Turlock, USA (between the vocational Gymnasium and Turlock High School)

<doc id="1171527" wikidata="Q17115996" url="?curid=1171527" title="Bourré">
<text>Bourré (also commonly known as Bouré and Boo-Ray) is a trick-taking gambling card game primarily played in the Acadiana region of Louisiana in the United States of America. It is also played in the Greek island of Psara, with the name Boureki (Μπουρέκι in Greek). The game&#x27;s closest relatives are probably Spades and Euchre; like many regional games, Bourré sports many variant rules for both play and betting considerations.

==Object==
The object of Bourré is to take a majority of the &quot;tricks&quot; in each &quot;hand&quot; and thereby claim the money in the &quot;pot&quot;. If a player cannot take a majority of tricks, the secondary goal is to keep from &quot;bourréing&quot;, or taking no tricks at all. A bourré usually comes at a high penalty, including matching the amount of money in the pot.

==Rules==

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, aces high and two to seven players. With seven players, only three cards may be discarded (so as to not have to re-use them for later players). After every player antes, the dealer passes out five cards to each player, one at a time. In a traditional game, the dealer flips their own fifth card – the last dealt – and that card&#x27;s suit is considered trumps (in Boureki &quot;kozia&quot; or &quot;atoy&quot;). As in Spades, the chosen suit beats all others; a two of trumps is &quot;higher&quot; in rank than an ace of any other suit.

After the deal, each player (starting to the dealer&#x27;s left and continuing clockwise) states an intent to play. Many variants require an additional ante at this point. Those who are not playing in the hand &quot;fold&quot;; those cards are collected by the dealer.

Once every player has stated intent, the dealer asks those still in the game (in the same order as before) how many new cards they desire. They can take any number from zero to five, discarding an equal amount from their original set; their discards go in a separate pile and the dealer hands them as many new cards as they discarded. If the main stock is depleted before all players have been serviced, the dealer shuffles the &quot;folded&quot; hands and deals those; if that stock is depleted as well, the discards are shuffled and used.

Once everyone, including the dealer, has either folded or completed their redraw, the trick-taking phase begins. The first player to the dealer&#x27;s left who is still in the game starts by playing any card (with few exceptions); rules of play are as follows (a lower-numbered rule overrides any higher-numbered):
#You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead,
#You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards, and must &quot;play to win&quot;. If the only trump played is a three and you hold the two and ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the ace of trumps. If you cannot &quot;play to win&quot; then it is not required to play a trump card that cannot possibly win the trick. Some variants override the &quot;play to win&quot; rule and require a trump card to be played regardless.
#If you have neither cards of the lead suit nor trumps, you may play any card. This is an &quot;off&quot; card and is effectively lower than a two of the lead suit.

The winner of a given &quot;round&quot; or &quot;trick&quot; collects the cards and places them face-up in front of them, then leads with another card. Play proceeds until all five tricks have been completed.

*If a single player has taken more tricks than any other player, that player has won the hand and may take all of the winnings in the pot.
*If more than one player ties for the most tricks, this is a &quot;split pot.&quot; With five tricks, the only possible splits are 2-2-1 and 1-1-1-1-1. On a split pot, the winnings stay on the table.
*Any player who took no tricks or &quot;reneged&quot; during play— that is, did not follow the rules properly—has &quot;bourréd&quot; and must match the pot for the next round instead of adding the usual ante. For example, if there are five red chips in the pot at the end of a hand and someone has bourréd, they must put five red chips (or their equivalent) into the pot for the next round. Matching the pot is required at the end of a round regardless of whether the player continues to the next round.

Deal then passes to the left.

There are complex rules about forced plays; a simple example is when someone who has just taken their second trick holds the ace of trumps. Since the ace of trumps is unbeatable, they &quot;must&quot; play it as their next card. Similar occurrences are when a player has taken one trick and has both ace and king or (more complex) ace, queen and jack. This is sometimes called the &quot;cinch win&quot; rule. If it is a &quot;cinch&quot; that you will win, you must win immediately by laying down the winning cards all at once. While the rules themselves are simple in theory, details about forced plays can make Bourré challenging for even a skilled player.

The &quot;must play to win&quot; rule can have contentious results if a player is playing &quot;nice&quot;, trying to keep others from bourréing. Most games disallow such &quot;nice&quot; plays; players must attempt to bourré as many other players as possible. As Bourré is a game with imperfect information and gamesmanship is expected to trump rules-lawyering, care should be applied to any analysis of rounds when looking for such &quot;nice&quot; plays.

==Variations==
Variations in rules of Bourré abound, possibly due to its nature as a regional game. Perhaps most common is the introduction of a &quot;pot limit&quot;, which caps the total amount a single bourré or renege can cost a given player. In some games, it is common for the dealer to ante for all of the players; this simplifies trying to determine whether individuals have anteed. In a sense, the dealer is paying for his face-up trump. In this variation, for a five-person, one-dollar-ante game, the dealer of each hand would ante five dollars. A common point of dissent is whether a player who holds trumps but not the lead suit should be forced to play a trump if he cannot beat a higher trump already on the table; while consensus seems to be that the &quot;play to win&quot; rule applies, groups of players are known to require a player to play trump even though the player cannot possibly win the trick. Punishments for misplay range from simple retraction (good for new players), retraction-and-renege, or just a renege, which can lead to the misplaying individual attempting to bourré one or more other players. The default ante amount is understandably variable and the second ante is fairly common.

==In the news==
A game of Bourré apparently sparked the dispute that led to NBA star Gilbert Arenas&#x27;s suspension. During an overnight flight from Phoenix to Washington, DC, on December 19, 2009, Arenas needled teammate Javaris Crittenton for losing over $1,000 in a game of Bourré. The two exchanged words, with Arenas joking that he would blow up Crittenton&#x27;s car and Crittenton saying he would shoot Arenas in his surgically repaired knee. Two days later Arenas brought four guns to the Washington Wizards&#x27; locker room and left them, with a sign saying &quot;Pick One,&quot; at Crittenton&#x27;s locker. The incident, combined with Arenas&#x27;s trivialization of it in the media, led to his suspension from the NBA on January 6, 2010.

A game of Bourré also sparked a fight on the Memphis Grizzlies&#x27; team plane between NBA teammates OJ Mayo and Tony Allen in January 2011, when Mayo refused to settle a debt from a game.

<doc id="1171535" wikidata="Q856619" url="?curid=1171535" title="FC Tokyo">
<text>, commonly known as , is a Japanese professional football club based in Chōfu, Tokyo. The club plays in the J1 League, the top tier of football in the country.

From 2025, FC Tokyo is one of five in the J.League to be simply called &quot;Football Club&quot; without an extended name, the other being FC Imabari of J2 League along with FC Gifu and FC Osaka in J3 League.

The club have won 1 J2 League titles, 1 Emperor&#x27;s Cup and 3 J.League Cup. The club also won the 2010 J.League Cup / Copa Sudamericana Championship.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1935–1997) ===
The team started as a company team, Tokyo Gas Football Club (東京ガスサッカー部) in 1935 The club played in the Tokyo League got promoted to the Kanto League in 1986 and suddenly achieved a good 4th-place finish. Their first appearance in the national leagues was in 1991, the last season of the old Japan Soccer League. With addition of the Brazilian football player Amaral and the manager Kiyoshi Okuma at the helm, the team gradually became competitive and in 1997, the team finished second, winning the JFL championship the next year. However, at the time the team lacked the necessary qualifications for a promotion to the J1 league and so stayed in J2.

=== Establishment of a new identity (1998–&quot;present&quot;) ===
Following this, on 1 October 1998, companies like Tokyo Gas, TEPCO, ampm, TV Tokyo, and Culture Convenience Club, set up a joint company &quot;Tokyo Football Club Company&quot; with the aim of making the team eligible for joining the J.League. In 1999, the team changed its name to &quot;FC Tokyo&quot; and entered the second division of the J2 League, defeating three J1 League teams in a row in the J.League Cup, which they first participated in, and advancing to the top four. In the same year, FC Tokyo became eligible, they finished second in the J2 league and were automatically promoted to J1 beginning in the 2000 season. Despite a widespread belief that the team would barely win enough to stay in the J1, the team won four games in a row since its opening game and managed to finish at the 7th spot.

Helped by its winning record, the attendance shot up and it is still above that of well-known Tokyo Verdy 1969 that moved its home town from Kawasaki, Kanagawa in 2001. Since 2002, the team welcomed Hiromi Hara as its manager and aimed for a championship with a strong offense. The 2003 season had the team finish in 4th, its highest ever. In August of the same year, it held a friendly match against one of the greatest football clubs, Real Madrid losing 3–0 but gaining valuable experiences both on and off the field for what it takes to be a great football club.

Long-time leader Amaral, nicknamed &quot;The King of Tokyo&quot; by his fans, departed the team to join Shonan Bellmare in 2004. He was replaced by Athens Olympics national football team player Yasuyuki Konno from Consadole Sapporo. In November of the same year, it won the J.League Cup for its first major title since joining the J.League.

After 10 years of participation in the J.League without a mascot character, the team adopted &quot;Tokyo Dorompa&quot;, a tanuki-like figure, as its mascot in January, 2009.

On 4 December 2010, FC Tokyo had to win their final game of the season away to already relegated Kyoto Sanga. FC Tokyo lost 2–0 and went back down to the second tier for the first time in 11 years. Nevertheless, they bounced back at the first attempt, winning the J2 League title in November 2011.

Before their 2011 Emperor&#x27;s Cup win, FC Tokyo reached the semifinals of the competition three times: in 1997 (as Tokyo Gas), 2008, and on 2010. Their 2011 win was remarkably special, as the club won the competition whilst being a J2 team. They became the first J2 team, and third among the second-tier champions overall (after NKK SC in 1981 and Júbilo Iwata in 1982), to accomplish the feat of winning the competition.

== Stadium ==
FC Tokyo uses Ajinomoto Stadium as its home ground (the official name of this stadium is Tokyo Stadium). It can hold up to 49,970 capacity of fans in the stadium. For a long time it did not have a home stadium of its own and played at various football fields such as the National Olympic Stadium, the National Nishigaoka Football Field, Edogawa Special Ward Stadium, and the Komazawa Olympic Park Stadium, but in 2001 it finally found a permanent home. The club&#x27;s training grounds are Sarue Ground in Kōtō, Tokyo, and Kodaira Ground in Kodaira, Tokyo.

In order to comply with height limitation close to the airport, the pitch is sunk below the level of the land around the stadium

The civil parish includes the hamlet of Axford about west of Ramsbury, and three smaller hamlets: New Town, close to Ramsbury to the southeast, and Knighton and Whittonditch, both about to the east. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 1,989.

==History==
The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a large settlement of 156 households at &quot;Ramesberie&quot;.

Littlecote Roman Villa is in the parish. The earliest written history of Ramsbury can be traced from the Saxon era when the bishopric of Ramsbury was created in 909 AD.

Between 1942 and 1946, during World War II, there was a Royal Air Force airfield known as RAF Ramsbury on a ridge of high ground to the south of the village.

===Fairs===
Throughout the Middle Ages, Ramsbury traditionally held two annual fairs – a livestock fair in the spring, and a hiring fair or Mop fair at Michaelmas. Nearby Marlborough&#x27;s tradition of holding one Mop each side of Michaelmas (&quot;Little Mop&quot; on the Saturday before and &quot;Big Mop&quot; on the Saturday after) was originally a means to accommodate the (then) more prestigious Ramsbury Mop. By the 19th century, both fairs had become cattle fairs. The spring cattle fair (traditionally held on 14 May) ceased in 1939. The Michaelmas fair slowly lost its original agricultural connections, becoming purely a funfair in 1946 before ceasing in the 1950s.

An annual carnival was instituted to replace the fairs and survived until the 1990s, but has in turn been replaced with a biennial street fair which sees the High Street closed from the Square to the Memorial Hall.

===Ramsbury Building Society===
The Provident Union Investment Society was founded in Ramsbury 1846, becoming the Ramsbury Building Society in 1928. It was headquartered in the Square until 1982 and took as its logo the ancient wych-elm which grew immediately opposite. 
Subsequent mergers saw the building society being subsumed into the Regency and West of England Building Society, then the Portman Building Society, and finally the Nationwide Building Society.

==Religion==
===Medieval episcopal see===

In Saxon times, Ramsbury was an important location for the Church, and several of its early bishops went on to become Archbishops of Canterbury. The episcopal see of Ramsbury was created in AD 909 when Wiltshire and Berkshire were taken from the bishopric of Winchester to form the new diocese of Ramsbury. It was occasionally referred to as the bishopric of Ramsbury and Sonning. In 1058 it was joined with the bishopric of Sherborne to form the diocese of Sarum (Salisbury), and the see was translated to Old Sarum in 1075.

Although no longer a diocesan see, the bishopric of Ramsbury is now an episcopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury (see Bishop of Ramsbury), and is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.

=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of the Holy Cross was begun in the 13th century, possibly on the site of the former 11th century cathedral of the Diocese of Ramsbury, and enlarged later that century or in the early 14th. In the 15th century the chancel was lengthened and re-roofed. In 1891–2 the aisles were rebuilt and the south porch rebuilt.

The building is of flint with limestone dressings, and the chancel is finished in roughcast. The west tower is described as &quot;massive&quot; and has substantial corner buttresses.

The collection of stone fragments held in the church includes four which appear to be Norman. The font bowl is 12th century. The interior fittings, which include two brass chandeliers dated 1751, are described by Pevsner as &quot;quite an uncommon wealth&quot;. The tower has six bells, five of them dated 1708 and made by the elder Abraham Rudhall. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1966.

In 1973 Ramsbury (with Axford) was united with the benefice of Aldbourne and Baydon to form the Whitton benefice and a team ministry was established. Chilton Foliat and Froxfield were added to Whitton in 1976.

=== Others ===
Until the 1790s, when it became an independent ecclesiastical parish, Baydon was a chapelry of Ramsbury parish. A chapel of ease dedicated to St Michael was built in 1856 at Axford and continues in use.

Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Primitive Methodists and Wesleyan Methodists met at Ramsbury and Axford. The last to close was the Methodist Church, in the late 2010s.

== Notable buildings ==
The parish has two Grade I listed buildings in addition to Holy Cross church. Ramsbury Manor was built in the 1680s by Robert Hooke for Sir William Jones, lawyer, Attorney General and member of Parliament. The house has two storeys and an attic, with nine bays at the front; to the south is a courtyard of servants&#x27; cottages. It stands in parkland to the west of the village, on the north bank of the Kennet, which has been dammed to form a lake. At the park&#x27;s main entrance are Grade II* listed gates and lodges.

Also Grade I listed is Axford Farmhouse, built in the 17th century and altered in the 19th, with an attached 13th-century chapel.

There are three Grade II* listed houses: Riverside House, Axford (16th and 17th centuries, part timber-framed); Parliament Piece, Ramsbury (five bays, 17th century, extended 19th); and Crowood House, north of Ramsbury (also five bays, late 17th and early 19th).

==Education==
From 1786 to the 1840s, Edward and Arthur Meyrick ran a school at Ramsbury Hill House on Back Lane and a girls&#x27; school was funded by Louisa Read of Crowood House (d.1879). In 1878, Mary Jane Lanfear left £600 to fund apprenticeships for local boys. The Lanfear Educational Trust still operates, making small educational grants to young people in Ramsbury and Axford.

In 1875, a board school was built on Back Lane, opposite Isles Road. It is now a private residence. Today, Ramsbury Pre-School and Primary School are in modern buildings on Isles Road, while secondary education is provided at St John&#x27;s School, Marlborough.

==Governance==
Ramsbury has an elected parish council and also falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all of the most significant local government services.

The parish was part of Ramsbury Rural District from 1894 until 1934, Marlborough and Ramsbury Rural District until 1974, and Kennet District until the creation of the unitary authority in 2009.

==The Tree==
For centuries, Ramsbury was known for its Tree – a large wych elm which stood in the Square at the heart of the village. The Tree was first mentioned in a report in 1751, by which time it must have already been well established. In its prime, its spread was said to have touched the buildings on all sides of the Square. Photographs from the early 20th century show the Tree in apparently fine health, although perhaps reduced from its former size. But, by the 1920s, the Tree was in noticeable decline. It gradually succumbed to old age, eventually dying in 1983 by which time it would have been well over 230 years old.

The gnarled stump remained in the Square for several years while a replacement was discussed. Many villagers wanted to keep the old tree, dead or not, where it had stood for so many centuries. However, after a referendum which threatened to split the village, it was eventually agreed that it should be replaced. Over the course of the second half of the 20th century, Dutch elm disease had ravaged the native populations of elm species and so an oak sapling (sponsored by Portman Building Society) was sourced from Epping Forest and planted to replace the old tree.

==Notable residents==
Local people are known as Ramsbury Bulldogs, contrasting with the neighbouring village of Aldbourne, where the locals are known as Dabchicks.

The village&#x27;s notable residents have included Sir Francis Burdett (1770–1844), a radical Whig politician, and his daughter Angela Burdett-Coutts. In 1837 Angela became the richest woman in England when she inherited her grandfather&#x27;s fortune. Over several years she gave most of this money away to good causes: nearly three million pounds by the time she died in 1906. Both lived in Ramsbury Manor. Other owners of the manor include William Rootes (from 1958), industrialist and motor manufacturer; and Harry Hyams (from 1964 until his death in 2015), property developer.

Stefan Persson, the owner of H&amp;M, has a main residence on the outskirts of Ramsbury. He also owns the Ramsbury microbrewery which brews Ramsbury Gold bottled beer, amongst others. Composer David Fanshawe lived near Ramsbury until his death in July 2010.

==Food and drink==
There are two pubs situated in Ramsbury: The Bell on the Square and the Crown and Anchor on the corner of Crowood Lane and Oxford Street, as well as the Royal British Legion&#x27;s branch on the High Street. In addition to the Ramsbury Brewery, Distillery and Smokehouse, several other notable local food and drink producers are based in Ramsbury. The Ramsbury Tea Company, in particular, has won several national awards.

<doc id="1171539" wikidata="Q259139" url="?curid=1171539" title="Cree syllabics">
<text>Cree syllabics are the versions of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics used to write Cree dialects, including the original syllabics system created for Cree and Ojibwe. There are two main varieties of syllabics for Cree: Western Cree syllabics and Eastern Cree syllabics. Syllabics were later adapted to several other languages. It is estimated that over 70,000 Algonquian-speaking people use the script, from Saskatchewan in the west to Hudson Bay in the east, the US border to Mackenzie and Kewatin (the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) in the north.

==History==

Cree syllabics were developed for Ojibwe by James Evans, a missionary in what is now Manitoba in the 1830s. Evans had originally adapted the Latin script to Ojibwe (see Evans system), but after learning of the success of the Cherokee syllabary, he experimented with invented scripts based on his familiarity with shorthand and Devanagari.

When Evans later worked with the closely related Cree and ran into trouble with the Latin alphabet, he turned to his Ojibwe project and in 1840 adapted it to Cree. The result contained just nine glyph shapes, each of which stood for a syllable with the vowels determined by the shapes&#x27; orientation. After the 1841 publication of a syllabics hymn book, the new script spread quickly. The Cree valued it because it could be learned in just a few hours and because it was visually distinctive from the Latin script of the colonial languages. Virtually all Cree became literate in the new syllabary within a few years. Evans taught by writing on birchbark with soot, and he became known as &quot;the man who made birchbark talk.&quot;

==Structure==
Canadian Aboriginal syllabics are unique among abugida scripts in that the orientation of a symbol, rather than modifications of its shape or diacritic marks, determines the vowel of a syllable. Each basic shape corresponds to a specific consonant sound; this is flipped or rotated to denote the accompanying vowel.

Like the Latin alphabet, syllabics are written from left to right, with each new line of writing directly under the previous one.

Meaning: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
==Variants==
The syllabary continues in use for dialects of Cree west of the Manitoba–Ontario border as Western Cree syllabics. John Horden introduced modifications in the 1850s in the James Bay area. These were standardized in 1865 to form Eastern Cree syllabics, used today for many eastern dialects of Cree, Naskapi, and Ojibwe, though Cree dialects of eastern Quebec use the Latin alphabet. The two versions differ primarily in the way they indicate syllable-final consonants, in how they mark the semi-vowel , and in how they reflect the phonological differences between Cree dialects. There are more minor local differences in orthography, shapes of the characters, writing styles, and punctuation, with some writers using dots or spaces between words, and others not indicating word separation.

==Cree numerals==
The syllabics have been recorded to have been used as numerals with individual fixed integer values in certain combinations akin to that of the Roman system:
* a vertical bar represents 1,
* ᐅ &quot;o&quot; represents 3 (Iᐅ equals 4),
* ᐊ &quot;a&quot; represents numerals more than 6 (ᐅᐊ equals 6, ᐊ equals 7, ᐊII equals 9),
* ᒥ &quot;mi&quot; represents 10,
* looped syllables (ᓀᓂᓄᓇᑯᑲᑫᑭ) represent 20-90.

The zero is represented as an eight pointed star.

==Modern usage==
Though used for manuscripts, letters, and personal records since the 19th century, the need for special type long restricted printed syllabics to missionary publications. However, with the development of syllabic typewriters and, later, word processors, control of the script passed to native speakers, and it is now used for schoolbooks, periodicals, and official documents.

<text>&quot;Hitsville U.S.A.&quot; is the nickname given to Motown&#x27;s first headquarters and recording studio. The house (formerly a photographers&#x27; studio) is located at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit near the New Center area of the city. Motown founder Berry Gordy bought the house in 1959.

Gordy converted the house to use it as the record label&#x27;s administrative building and recording studio. After finding mainstream success from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, Gordy moved the label to Los Angeles and established the Hitsville West studio working in television and film production as well as music production.

Today, the &quot;Hitsville U.S.A.&quot; property operates as the Motown Museum, which is dedicated to the legacy of the record label, its artists, and its music. The museum occupies the original house and an adjacent former residence.

==West Grand Boulevard==

In 1959, Gordy formed his first label, Tamla Records, and purchased the property that would become Motown&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. studio. The photography studio located in the back of the property was modified into a small recording studio, which was open 22 hours a day (closing from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. for maintenance), and the Gordys moved into the second-floor living quarters. Within seven years, Motown would occupy seven additional neighboring houses:
* Hitsville U.S.A., 1959: (ground floor) administrative office, tape library, control room, Studio A; (upper floor) Gordy living quarters (1959–1962), artists and repertoire (1962–1972)
* Jobete Publishing office, 1961: sales, billing, collections, shipping, and public relations
* Berry Gordy Jr. Enterprises, 1962: offices for Berry Gordy Jr. and his sister Esther Gordy Edwards
* Finance department, 1965: royalties and payroll
* Artist personal development, 1966: Harvey Fuqua (head of artist development and producer of stage performances), Maxine Powell (instructor in grooming, poise, and social graces for Motown artists), Maurice King (vocal coach, musical director and arranger), Cholly Atkins (house choreography), and rehearsal studios
* Two houses for administrative offices, 1966: sales and marketing, traveling and traffic, and mixing and mastering
* ITMI (International Talent Management Inc.) office, 1966: management

By the end of 1966, Motown had hired over 450 employees and had a gross income of $20 million.

===Expansion and relocation===
In 1967, Berry Gordy purchased what is now known as the Motown mansion, in Detroit&#x27;s Boston-Edison Historic District, as his home, leaving his previous home to his sister Anna and her then-husband, Marvin Gaye (photos for the cover of his album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; were taken there). In 1968, Gordy purchased the Donovan building, on the corner of Woodward Avenue and Interstate 75, and moved Motown&#x27;s Detroit offices there (the Donovan building was demolished in January 2006 to provide parking spaces for Super Bowl XL). In the same year Gordy purchased Golden World Records and its recording studio became Motown&#x27;s Studio B.

In 1972, Gordy relocated the Motown Records headquarters to Los Angeles. The original Hitsville studios, which had produced a long string of worldwide hits, is now the Motown Museum. The next year, he reorganized the company; it became Motown Industries, an entertainment conglomerate which would include record, movie, television and publishing divisions. Many Motown fans believed the company&#x27;s heart and soul were lost following the move and that its golden age of creativity ended after its 13 years in Detroit. Esther Gordy Edwards refused to move to California and was put in charge of what was left of Motown&#x27;s Detroit office in the Hitsville building.

===Motown Museum===

Edwards received several requests to visit the Hitsville building. She and her secretary put up posters and gold records. She also carefully preserved Studio A. Since 1985, the Hitsville U.S.A. building has been the site of the Motown Museum, dedicated to the legacy of the record label, its artists, and its music.

On October 23, 1988, Michael Jackson donated a black fedora and studded white right-hand glove, along with $125,000 which was the net proceeds of the first show of his Bad World Tour on October 24 in The Palace of Auburn Hills, to the Motown Museum. Edwards&#x27;s granddaughter Robin Terry is involved as both the board chair and CEO.

Three of the original homes are used by the Motown Museum. Hitsville U.S.A. and the Jobete office are connected for the exhibit, which contains costumes, photos, and records from Motown&#x27;s success era. Also featured are Motown&#x27;s Studio A and Berry Gordy&#x27;s upstairs apartment, decorated to appear as they did during the 1960s. The finance department is currently an administrative office. West Grand Boulevard was renamed &quot;Berry Gordy, Jr. Boulevard&quot; in the area where the Motown Historical Museum is located. The museum is one of Detroit&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations.

In October 2016, the museum announced a $50-million-dollar expansion plan in order to create space for interactive exhibits and recording studios. Since the announcement, the museum has received donations from organizations like The Kresge Foundation, the AARP, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to help with both the expansion as well as community programming.

===Motown&#x27;s Steinway grand piano===
The Motown piano is an 1877 Steinway &amp; Sons Model D grand piano, used by many musicians including the Funk Brothers studio band, at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio B from 1967 to 1972. On July 24, 2011, Paul McCartney was in Detroit for a performance at Comerica Park, as part of his On the Run Tour; he visited the Motown Museum for a private guided tour. While touring Studio A, he asked to play the Motown piano, only to find that it was not in playing condition. McCartney supported a restoration by Steinway &amp; Sons in 2012, and together with Berry Gordy played it during a charity event in September of that year.

The piano had come into Motown&#x27;s possession when it bought Golden World Records in 1967. The Golden World studio then became Hitsville U.S.A. Studio B.
The piano is on display in Studio A at the Motown Museum.

==&quot;Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection&quot;==
In 1992, Motown released two four-CD boxed sets compiling 104 singles released during its &quot;Detroit era&quot;, entitled&quot; Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection 1959–1971&quot; and 76 singles from its &quot;Los Angeles era&quot;, &quot;Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection Volume Two 1972–1992&quot;.

<doc id="1171548" wikidata="Q487962" url="?curid=1171548" title="Han Ji-hye">
<text>Han Ji-hye (born Lee Ji-hye on June 29, 1984) is a South Korean actress.

==Background==
Born Lee Ji-hye, she used the stage name &quot;Han Ji-hye&quot; upon learning that her real name would cause confusion among fans since an older actress, Lena Lee, also has the same Korean name.

==Career==
===2001–2007===
Han made her entertainment debut as a model, then started acting in supporting roles in TV dramas such as &quot;Summer Scent&quot;. She landed her first leading role in &quot;Sweet 18&quot;. The next couple of years saw Han starring in low-rating dramas, but her 2007 daily drama &quot;Likeable or Not&quot; became very popular, topping the ratings chart during its run and recording the highest rating for a daily drama since 2000. Han then displayed newfound maturity and great improvement in her acting in the 2008 epic drama &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

===2008–2011===
In 2008, Han along with Leon Jay Williams sang the Korean and Chinese versions of Olympic theme song &quot;Friends.&quot; She was brought to the project via a proposal from the Chinese Olympic committee to sing &quot;Friends&quot; as the official swimming theme of the Beijing National Aquatics Centre at the Beijing Olympics. Less than a year later, she again recorded a digital single, an upbeat electro-pop song titled &quot;Luv Luv&quot;.

After studying the craft of shoemaking and design in Florence, Italy, Han collaborated with existing shoe brand Jinny Kim to design and produce her own line, called &quot;H by Jinny Kim.&quot; This was documented on &quot;Han Ji-hye: Shoes! My Dream!&quot; which aired on cable channel O&#x27;live TV. The Fall/Winter 2009 collection were sold in major department stores in Seoul and the surrounding metro areas, as well as in a well-known department store in Singapore and various online shopping malls.

Han then published &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, a collection of autobiographical lifestyle essays. The volume focused on Han&#x27;s hobbies and daily life rather than on her onscreen work and contained Han&#x27;s writings about her experiences as a twentysomething single woman, as well as her reflections on her life. It also touched on the various projects she has undertaken such as designing shoes, studying tea ceremony, learning about ceramics, DIY furniture making, and fabric art.

Director Lee Joon-ik cast Han in his 2010 period action film &quot;Blades of Blood&quot; without auditioning her — not for her talents, but for her Asian-looking eyes. Aside from finding her single eyelid unique and difficult to find in recent years, Lee liked that she related to him in a natural manner. Han said that Lee scolded her a lot in the beginning of the shoot for not acting well, so she used the pain in her heart to portray her character such that she improved towards the middle of the filming and learned a lot from him. She also sang on the soundtrack, having played a gisaeng in the film.

After starring in her first period drama series in 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Duo&quot;, she played a woman who helps a young man achieve his dreams in the single-episode drama &quot;Pianist&quot;, and a visually impaired teacher in the 2-part Chuseok special &quot;The Great Gift&quot;. She also starred in her first Chinese drama, &quot;Heavenly Embroidery&quot;.

===2012–present===
Han played the protagonist in the 2012 drama &quot;May Queen&quot;, the success story of a woman in the shipbuilding industry during Korea&#x27;s modernization. In 2013, she portrayed dual roles in &quot;Pots of Gold&quot; (also known as &quot;I Summon You, Gold!&quot; or &quot;Gold, Appear!&quot;), a family comedy that explores money, love and marriage.
This was followed by leading roles as a cold-hearted heiress in &quot;The Full Sun&quot;, and as a wrongfully convicted prisoner turned baker in &quot;4 Legendary Witches&quot; in 2014.

In January 2016, Han signed with management agency KeyEast. In 2018, she made a comeback in the family drama &quot;Shall We Live Together&quot;.

==Personal life==
On September 21, 2010, Han married public prosecutor Jung Hyuk-joon in a private ceremony in Hawaii. On the December 31, 2020, Han announced on social media that she is expecting a child, due in Summer 2021. On June 23, 2021, Han&#x27;s agency announced that had given birth to a daughter Jung Yoon-seul. Both her husband and daughter appeared on public television for the first time via Stars&#x27; Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.

<text>Terrence Joseph Sejnowski (; born 13 August 1947) is the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where he directs the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory and is the director of the Crick-Jacobs center for theoretical and computational biology. He has performed research in neural networks and computational neuroscience.

Sejnowski is also Professor of Biological Sciences and adjunct professor in the departments of neurosciences, psychology, cognitive science, computer science and engineering at the University of California, San Diego, where he is co-director of the Institute for Neural Computation.

With Barbara Oakley, he co-created and taught &quot;Learning How To Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects&quot;, the world&#x27;s most popular online course, available on Coursera.

== Early life and education ==
Sejnowski was born in Cleveland in 1947. 

Sejnowski received a Bachelor of Science with a major in physics from the Case Western Reserve University in 1968, a Master of Arts in physics from Princeton University (advised by John Archibald Wheeler), and a Doctor of Philosophy in physics from Princeton University in 1978 (advised by John Hopfield). 

While in Princeton for his M.A. in physics, he analyzed the strength of gravitational waves from all known sources at the time, and the required sensitivity needed for detection. He noticed that all gravitational wave detectors were 1000x too insensitive to detect, and, thinking that the requisite detectors would not appear until 30 years later, decided to go into a different field.

==Career and research==
From 1978–1979 Sejnowski was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biology at Princeton University with Alan Gelperin and from 1979–1981 he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School with Stephen Kuffler. In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Biophysics at the Johns Hopkins University, where he achieved the rank of Professor before moving to San Diego, California in 1988. He was an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1991 to 2018.

He has had a long-standing affiliation with the California Institute of Technology, as a Wiersma Visiting Professor of Neurobiology in 1987, as a Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar in 1993 and as a part-time Visiting Professor 1995–1998. In 2004, he was named the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute and the director of the Crick-Jacobs Center for Theoretical and Computational Biology.

===Honours and awards===
Sejnowski received a Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1984 from the National Science Foundation (NSF). He received the Wright Prize from the Harvey Mudd College for excellence in interdisciplinary research in 1996 and the Hebb Prize for his contributions to learning algorithms by the International Neural Network Society in 1999. He became a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 2000 for fundamental advances in the theory and practice of neural networks and for contributions to computational neuroscience. In the same year, he also received their Neural Network Pioneer Award in 2002. In 2003, he was elected to the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars. He is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council. He was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2008. In 2010, he was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), and elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2011. In 2017, he was elected to the National Academy of Inventors. These achievements place him in a group of only three living people to have been elected to all four of the national academies. In 2013, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2014. He was awarded the 2015 Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Zurich in 2017. In 2022, he was awarded the Gruber Neuroscience Prize. In 2024, he was awarded The Brain Prize for pioneering work in theoretical neuroscience alongside Larry Abbott and Haim Sompolinsky. That same year, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from Princeton University.

=== Neural networks ===
His research in neural networks and computational neuroscience has been pioneering. In the early 1980s, particularly following work by John Hopfield, computer simulations of neural networks became widespread. Early applications, particularly by Sejnowski and Geoffrey Hinton, demonstrated that simple neural networks could be made to learn tasks of at least some sophistication. In 1989, Sejnowski founded Neural Computation, published by the MIT Press, the leading journal in neural networks and computational neuroscience. He is also the President of the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees the annual NeurIPS Conference. This interdisciplinary meeting brings together researchers from many disciplines, including biology, physics, mathematics, and engineering.

He co-invented the Boltzmann machine with Geoffrey Hinton and pioneered the application of learning algorithms to difficult problems in speech (NETtalk) and vision. His postdoc, Tony Bell, developed the infomax algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has been widely adopted in machine learning, signal processing and data mining.

=== Research ===
The long-range goal of Sejnowski&#x27;s research is to understand the computational resources of brains and to build linking principles from brain to behavior using computational models. This goal is being pursued with a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches at several levels of investigation ranging from the biophysical level to the systems level. Hippocampal and cortical slice preparations are being used to explore the properties of single neurons and synapses, including the precision of spike firing and the influence of neuromodulators. Biophysical models of electrical and chemical signal processing within neurons are used as an adjunct to physiological experiments. New techniques have been developed for modeling cell signaling using Monte Carlo methods (MCell).

The central issues being addressed are how dendrites integrate synaptic signals in neurons, how networks of neurons generate dynamical patterns of activity, how sensory information is represented in the cerebral cortex, how memory representations are formed and consolidated during sleep, and how visuo-motor transformations are adaptively organized. His laboratory has developed new methods for analyzing the sources for electrical and magnetic signals recorded from the scalp and hemodynamic signals from functional neuroimaging by blind separation using ICA. The EEGLAB public software which was as of 2012 the most popular software for processing EEG data was originally developed in his laboratory.

=== Symposia ===
He has participated and spoken at the Beyond Belief symposia in 2006 and 2007. He participated in the conference &quot;Waking Up to Sleep&quot; at the Salk Institute in February 2007 (online video available).

=== Membership ===
Sejnowski was a member of the Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health for the Brain Research through Application of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, announced by President Obama on 2 April 2013. Their BRAIN 2025 report was released by NIH on 5 June 2014 and has been used to prioritize NIH BRAIN Initiative projects. He was previously part of a team of engineers and neuroscientists who developed the Brain Activity Map Project, which served as the template for the BRAIN Initiative.

=== Authorship ===
In 1992, Sejnowski co-authored &quot;The Computational Brain&quot; with Patricia Churchland and in 2002 the book &quot;Liars, Lovers, and Heroes; What the New Brain Science Reveals About How We Become Who We are&quot; with Steven R. Quartz. His book, &quot;The Deep Learning Revolution&quot;, was published by the MIT Press in June 2018. His most recent book, &quot;ChatGPT and the Future of AI: The Deep Language Revolution&quot;, will published by the MIT Press in October 2024. 

He has co-created (with Professor Barbara Oakley) and teaches &quot;Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects&quot;, a massive open online course offered on Coursera. The course had its first three runs in August and October 2014 and January 2015, when it attracted approximately 300,000 students. In 2015, enrollment in the course reached 1 million, a total of about 2 million students as of August 2017, 3 million students as of 2021, and 4 million students as of 2024.

<doc id="1171566" wikidata="Q823384" url="?curid=1171566" title="Shimizu S-Pulse">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club located in Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture. S-Pulse is going to compete in the J1 League for the 2025 Season, after winning promotion from the Japanese second tier of professional league football, the J2 League in the 2024 season. The club was formed in 1991 as a founding member of the J.League (&quot;Original Ten&quot;), which began the following year. The club originally consisted of players drawn exclusively from Shizuoka Prefecture, a unique distinction at the time.

Given the club&#x27;s youth when compared to many of their J1 peers, S-Pulse have had a relatively large impact on Japanese football. Since the game turned professional in 1992, they are one of the most prolific and consistent performers in cup competitions, having made no less than ten final appearances: five times in the Emperor&#x27;s Cup and five times in the League Cup. Only Japan&#x27;s most successful professional team, Kashima Antlers, have made more final appearances. They have won both of these competitions once and have also won the Japanese Super Cup twice and the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup once. The club&#x27;s most recent cup final was in the 2012 J.League Cup which ended in defeat to Kashima.

Despite the club&#x27;s cup competition prowess, the J.League Division 1 title has so far eluded them. The closest S-Pulse came was in 1999 when, after winning the league&#x27;s second stage, they lost out on the title in a penalty shootout. When scores remained level after both legs of the title deciding match, Júbilo Iwata, S-Pulse&#x27;s local rivals, prevailed. Former S-Pulse and national team player Kenta Hasegawa, who made a substitute appearance in the second leg of this title decider, became club manager in 2005. He was the longest serving manager in the club&#x27;s history, in office until 2010. He resigned at the end of the season after failing to win any competitions and was replaced by Afshin Ghotbi. Ghotbi&#x27;s tenure lasted over 3 years, keeping the club as a mid-table J1 team until his departure in early 2014. From that season onward the club have churned through managers &amp; become a yo-yo club with relegation zone finishes in J1 while regularly winning promotion in J2.

==History==
===Shizuoka as a football prefecture===
Headquarters are established in Shizuoka Prefecture called the football kingdom in Japan.
As a prefecture, Shizuoka had historically been a strong footballing area of Japan; in particular being noted for its nationally successful high school teams and the numerous national team players which had emerged from the prefecture over the years. The prefectural police force of Shizuoka actually has an anthropomorphic football as a mascot. The west of the prefecture was already home to the company team of Yamaha Motor Corporation who played in the Japan Soccer League and who would later go on to form Júbilo Iwata, but it was believed there was room for another team for the football-hungry population. An earlier attempt had been made in the 1970s with the local club belonging to Nippon Light Metal Corp., which briefly competed in the JSL Division 2 under the name &quot;Hagoromo Club&quot;. With the advent of the professional league at the start of the 1990s, the concept of creating a team to both sign and represent the local footballing talent was fomented.

===Club formation===
Shimizu S-Pulse was formed in early 1991 as Shimizu FC from the backing of local businesses and people. This was a beginning which made them unique among the founding clubs of the J.League, with all others ex-company teams turned professional. Two months after formation, the club name was officially changed to Shimizu S-Pulse. &quot;S-Pulse&quot; is a combination of the &quot;S&quot; from Shizuoka, Shimizu, Supporter and Soccer, and &quot;Pulse&quot; from English to mean the spirit of all those who support the team.

On February 4, 1991, S-Pulse were approved by the J.League to compete in the newly formed professional league to start the following year. The club played its first ever game against Gamba Osaka on July 4, 1992, a date which is celebrated as the club&#x27;s memorial birthday. The match took place at the Nagai Stadium in Osaka. The club&#x27;s first competitive game was in the 1992 League Cup against Nagoya Grampus on September 5 at the Mizuho Athletic Stadium, and ended in a 3–2 defeat. Their competitive home début was held at Nihondaira Stadium shortly after on September 9 against Yokohama Marinos, which S-Pulse won 2–1. S-Pulse&#x27;s first league game was played in May 1993 away to Yokohama Flügels at Mitsuzawa Stadium. Flügels won 3–2. The first home league game was a 2–1 victory against Sanfrecce Hiroshima on May 19 of the same year.

===Professional football===
After being approved for participation in the J.League S-Pulse competed in the inaugural 1992 J.League Cup and made it to their first final. However, the dream start ended with defeat at the hands of Verdy Kawasaki. In 1993, S-Pulse became one of the ten founder members of the new J.League, and finished third after the 1st and 2nd stages were combined. Their second venture into the J.League Cup was another near miss, again losing in the final to Verdy Kawasaki. Finally, in 1996 the team got their hands on the trophy and also gained revenge on Verdy, beating them 5–4 on penalties in the final.

The year 1999 was marked with S-Pulse&#x27;s first appearance in the Japanese Super Cup, replacing Yokohama Flügels after their merger with Yokohama Marinos. However, S-Pulse lost the match 2–1. After performing well in both league stages, S-Pulse were up against local rivals Júbilo Iwata in the title decider, and after a 3–3 aggregate draw, lost the tie 4–2 on penalties. The new millennium brought better results for S-Pulse. Victory in the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 2000 and victory in the final of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup in 2001 meant that the S-Pulse trophy cabinet was beginning to fill up, and victories in the 2001 and 2002 Japanese Super Cups meant that the club had won four cups in three years.
In 2005, S-Pulse closed the year with a run to the Emperor&#x27;s Cup final in which they did not concede a single goal. However, this changed in the final against Urawa Red Diamonds, which they lost 2–1. After a near-miss in the league, avoiding a relegation play-off by only goal difference, manager Kenta Hasegawa&#x27;s work started to pay off the following year. In both 2006 and 2007 S-Pulse performed strongly in the league and finished in 4th place, followed by a fifth place standing in 2008. However, early exits in both cup competitions in 2006 and 2007, means they are currently without a trophy for five years. This is the longest barren spell in their history, although in 2008 they came close, being defeated in the final of the League Cup by Oita Trinita.

In 2011, S-Pulse made the &quot;Signing of the Century&quot; by making a move to complete the signing of Swedish and Arsenal F.C. legend Freddie Ljungberg. It is considered by many Japanese to be one of the greatest signings in league history. Many also believed that the signing would boost football in baseball-fanatic Japan, however Ljungberg departed, and subsequently retired, after months with the club. Later managements would turn out to be a catalyst for S-Pulse&#x27;s luck to run out in the next seasons.

S-Pulse would play four more seasons in J1, until their first-tier stay was broken in the 2015 season. The club was in good standing early in the first stage until they collapsed later, falling into the bottom three. Home fans were disappointed at the way their club was playing. S-Pulse failed to improve in the second stage, being at the relegation positions. After 23 seasons in the top flight, they were relegated to J2 (and the second tier) for the first time in their history after a 1–0 home loss to Vegalta Sendai on October 17, 2015.

S-Pulse bounced back to top flight football immediately, securing promotion to the J1 League on the final matchweek of the 2016 J2 League.

After six years at J1 League, in which they spent five of the six years on the lower half of the table, S-Pulse returned to J2 League after being confirmed relegation from the J1 on the last matchweek, having finished in 17th place, just above their rivals Júbilo Iwata.

On 27 October 2024, S-Pulse secure promotion to J1 League after defeat Tochigi SC narrowly 1-0 with goal Jelani Reshaun Sumiyoshi in 50th minute and return to top tier after two years absence.

===Supporters===
In common with other J.League teams, S-Pulse have a colourful and noisy collection of supporters who follow the team around the country. A supporter band is present at games home and away to help galvanise support and raise the decibel levels. The band models itself to a large degree after its Brazilian counterparts, and Latin rhythms and samba sounds predominate. For home games, S-Pulse&#x27;s more vocal supporters gather in the second tier of The Kop; the stand behind the west goal at Nihondaira Stadium. Also in this area can be found S-Pulse&#x27;s various organised supporter groups. These groups include fan clubs dedicated to specific players and are often identifiable by unique uniforms. These fan clubs work to organise events which include mass choreographed displays and the supporter band. Also housed in The Kop are S-Pulse&#x27;s band of ultras, who each game take over a central area behind the goal which has been dubbed The Dragon Zone. Often physical, it is not uncommon for the area to descend into a mosh pit after important goals, and signs posted around the stand inform and caution general supporters of the area&#x27;s lively nature. The club&#x27;s official fan club has several branches around the country, and S-Pulse supporters are officially listed as the team&#x27;s twelfth player.

===Ownership===
Although , which is a local major logistics company, had become a parent company just at the present, since the Shimizu S-Pulse was born as a citizen club from the start, vulnerable time suited it in the past in terms of a fund. As well as originally gathering its playing staff almost exclusively from Shizuoka prefecture, local corporation S-Lap Communications ran and financed the club. This was a company funded in part from Shimizu citizens, but in main by Shizuoka Television. After the J.League bubble burst in the late 1990s, Shizuoka Television withdrew backing, and in 1998 only a drastic restructuring kept the club afloat. Ownership of S-Pulse was reorganized between local companies under the leadership of Shimizu-based Suzuyo. It is now run under the company title of S-Pulse, Inc.

===In culture===
Despite their relatively short history, S-Pulse have had some impact on popular culture beyond football. Current manager and former player of some eight years and over 200 appearances, Kenta Hasegawa, makes occasional appearances in popular manga and anime series &quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;. In the show a boy with his name and referred to as Kenta-kun is sometimes seen. He loves football and is a classmate of title character Chibi Maruko. The author of the manga, Momoko Sakura, created this character after Hasegawa. Sakura and Hasegawa attended the same primary school during the same period. Unique S-Pulse related Chibi Maruko goods are also produced. In another example, two fictional characters from the popular &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; manga, who, on becoming professional footballers, join S-Pulse.

==Stadium==
&quot;Main articles: Nihondaira Sports Stadium, Shizuoka &quot;Ecopa&quot; Stadium, Kusanagi Athletic Stadium&quot;
S-Pulse&#x27;s main home arena is the Nihondaira Sports Stadium located in Shimizu, with a capacity of 19,594. However, over their history home games have been staged at a number of grounds. The first decade of S-Pulse&#x27;s existence sometimes saw &#x27;home&#x27; games played outside of Shizuoka prefecture, including at the National Stadium in Tokyo. The most frequently used other venue was Kusanagi Athletic Stadium. Utilised almost equally with Nihondaira over S-Pulse&#x27;s earliest years, this included six home games in 1993. Kusanagi was called home while Nihondairs was enlarged in 1994, and again while the pitch relaid in 2003. With a fully functioning Nihondaira, Kusanagi was used less commonly, with the most recent first team match being held there in 2003.

The most common reason for moving games is the restrictively low capacity of Nihondaira. This has often led the club to stage fixtures against neighbouring Júbilo Iwata and other high-profile clashes, at Shizuoka &quot;Ecopa&quot; Stadium. This stadium was built in 2001 for the following year&#x27;s World Cup and has a capacity of 51,349. Despite still being in Shizuoka Prefecture, Ecopa is over an hour&#x27;s travel from Shimizu, deep within the Jubilo catchment area. For such a fiercely contested derby, much of the home advantage is lost; a factor which contributed in part to the staging of the 2007 derby at Nihondaira despite demand for tickets far outstripping supply. The decision paid off with a home victory. 2007 saw all home games staged at Nihondaira for the first time since 1999. This was repeated in 2008, although between 2009 and 2015 Ecopa was used for at least one home league game. S-Pulse have chosen not to use Ecopa since 2015, playing all home league games at Nihondaira.
===Naming rights===

In October 2008 it was announced that naming rights would be sold for Nihondaira Stadium. In late November 2008 a deal was announced which would rename the stadium Outsourcing Stadium Nihondaira. The contract will run for four years starting from the 2009 season, and would be worth 90 000 000 per year.

A new 5-year deal sponsorship deal with IAI Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial robots, took effect on 1 March 2013. The stadium was renamed IAI Stadium Nihondaira, shortened by the club and supporters to I Sta. This sponsorship deal was extended a further five years in 2018.

===Future===

After filling Nihondaira on average over 81% for league games in 2008, in November of the same year the club expressed its desire for the ground, which is owned by Shizuoka City, to have its capacity expanded.

In 2020 the club restated their hope to build a new, larger home. In recent years various locations have been cited as a potential location for a new stadium, including next to Higashi-Shizuoka Station, and next to Shimizu Station.

==Training ground==

Located near the famous Miho no Matsubara are S-Pulse&#x27;s main training facilities. Named Miho Ground, training session are sometimes open to the public for autograph hunters. The Miho Ground has also housed the club offices since the club&#x27;s foundation.

==Rivalries==
S-Pulse share Shizuoka Prefecture with fierce local rivals, Júbilo Iwata. The rivalry dates back to the formation of the J.League when the newly formed S-Pulse were chosen ahead of Júbilo to take part in the first J.League season. Jubilo, who had existed as Yamaha FC in the Japan Soccer League since 1980, had to earn promotion via the 1992 season of the new Japan Football League. This has remained a bone of contention between long standing fans.

With Shizuoka long recognised as the homeland of football in Japan, the two teams have a history of fighting over the best players produced by the region&#x27;s high schools and universities. Good examples being Naohiro Takahara and Takahiro Yamanishi, who, after graduating from Shimizu Higashi High School, went on to sign for the Júbilo team which won three J.League championships between 1997 and 2002.

Alongside off-field factors, S-Pulse and Júbilo are locked in a perpetual struggle for supremacy on the field. During the J.League&#x27;s infancy, it was S-Pulse who experienced the greater success and support, but they found themselves in Iwata&#x27;s shadow for long periods either side of the turn of the century. Recently, S-Pulse have once again emerged as the area&#x27;s premier club, finishing above Júbilo in the league every season since 2006, and often enjoying further cup runs. 2008 was also the first year since 1995 that S-Pulse succeeded in drawing more supporters through the gates than their rivals.

Also based in Shizuoka are Fujieda MYFC, Azul Claro Numazu and Honda FC. Among those 3 clubs, only Fujieda that currently play at the same level as S-Pulse in J2 League, limiting any potential rivalry development with Azul Claro, who play in J3 League and Honda FC, which compete in Japan Football League, a level below J.League, to one-off cup pairings. Despite always performing well, Honda FC have resisted professionalisation and so are unable to join the J.League. The forerunners to Avispa Fukuoka and Sagan Tosu were originally also based in Shizuoka Prefecture, but had to move to Kyushu because of the dominance and fan saturation of S-Pulse and Iwata.

==Colours, crest and mascot==

===Colour, sponsors and manufacturers===

Since the team&#x27;s inception, the same colour combination for home shirts have been used each year. The colour scheme of orange shirts, shorts and socks was selected to reflect the famous local product of Shizuoka Prefecture; the mikan. The current bright orange hue, named &quot;S-Pulse Orange&quot; by the club, is the result of a gentle evolution from a more yellow/orange shade during the team&#x27;s early years. At the advent of the J.League, S-Pulse were the only top division club in the country to wear orange, a distinction which is now shared with other top flight mainstays, such as Albirex Niigata and Omiya Ardija. There is currently no third kit. Goalkeeping colours have changed more over the seasons, with the current first choice kit all black, and all green being the second choice.

Kit manufacturers have been exclusively Puma since 1997, and prior to this was shared with Mizuno. Shirt sponsors have been fairly consistent over the team&#x27;s sixteen-year history (see table below). The team&#x27;s current main shirt sponsor is the local Suzuyo Group, with additional sponsorship panels on the lower neck and arms from confectionery company Glico, and Japan Airlines, respectively.

=== Kit evolution ===


===Crest===
From the club&#x27;s formation up to 1996, the club used an earlier version of the team crest. while different, the previous design featured the same central lettering as the present badge. Unveiled for the 1997 season, the current team crest was designed around a globe to reflect the club&#x27;s ambitions as a world class professional team. The head of the badge takes the iconic shape of Mount Fuji&#x27;s perfect cone to symbolise the team&#x27;s representation of Shizuoka; the home of Mount Fuji. The choice of blue to accompany the team&#x27;s orange evokes Shimizu&#x27;s history as an industrial port town and its proximity to the sea of Suruga Bay. The team crest differs from the team logo which is often used to represent the club. The logo uses the central lettering from the crest, an example of which being the club&#x27;s shop sign. 

===Mascot===
Named &quot;Palchan&quot; and sporting big, winglike ears, S-Pulse&#x27;s mascot supports the team and entertains fans by performing choreographed, and often acrobatic, dance routines during the buildup to home games. He often performs with the help of his two younger siblings. Designed by professional cartoonist Guy Gilchrist, Palchan&#x27;s name is taken from the English &quot;pal&quot; and the &quot;pul&quot; of S-Pulse. The suffix &quot;chan&quot; is an affectionate title commonly used in Japan. Sporting team number zero, Palchan goods are a consistent best seller with various merchandise available. S-Pulse also have a cheer leading team named Orange Wave. The team perform routines prior to kick off and half time as well as making various appearances at S-Pulse themed events in and around Shizuoka.

==Brand==
In and around the team&#x27;s native Shizuoka City there are eight official club shops. Six of these are known as S-Pulse Dream House and serve as both club merchandise stores and match ticket offices. These can be found in Shizuoka, Shimizu, Fujieda, Suntō and Parche shopping centre, part of Shizuoka Station. The Shimizu Dream House also includes a projection screen and viewing area for the broadcasting of away games. The sixth, and newest, Dream House opened in March 2008 in Fuji City. There are two further S-Pulse shops, with one located in Yaizu, and one in S-Pulse Dream Plaza.

S-Pulse Dream Plaza is a shopping and entertainment complex in Shimizu, housing various attractions including restaurants, a ferris wheel, cinema and a football museum. From the nearby Shimizu Port, the S-Pulse Dream Ferry service runs daily to Izu. The team also lends its name to a series of futsal courts named, perhaps predictably, S-Pulse Dream Fields. These facilities are located in Fujieda, Fuji, Sunto and in Shimizu.

Dream Plaza can be found in a redeveloped part of Shimizu Port near the appropriately named S-Pulse Street. This is a road running into the city from the port area of Shimizu and is lined with various statues, monuments and art works related to and inspired by the city&#x27;s strong association with football. This includes foot and hand prints cast into metal of former notable players, and several S-Pulse-related statues. S-Pulse Street is also home to the Shimizu Branch of the S-Pulse Dream House.

The S-Pulse brand also extends into motorcycle racing, with the S-Pulse Dream Racing Team bearing the football team&#x27;s name, logo and mascot. The team competes in the All Japan Road Race ST600 class.

<text>Landsat 6, equipped with upgraded versions of the instruments on Landsat 5, was designed to carry forward the Landsat program. It was launched on October 5, 1993, with a Titan II launch vehicle, but failed to reach orbit. Landsat 6 omitted the Multi-Spectral Scanner found on its predecessors, but carried an Enhanced Thematic Mapper, which improved on the previous Thematic Mapper by adding a 15m-resolution panchromatic band.

==Development==

The Landsat 6 satellite was built by Martin Marietta Astro Space.

==Design==
===Operations===
The satellite was constructed from aluminum and used graphite struts. Landsat 6 had a hydrazine propulsion system. The spacecraft was powered by one solar array that had single-axis articulation and produced 1430 W. The power was stored in two NiCd batteries that had a capacity of 100 Ah. Data collected from the sensors was stored on tapes and transmitted to ground stations at 85 Mbit/s. The satellite was stabilized to 0.1 degrees in all three axes by using reaction wheels.

===Sensors===
The Enhanced Thematic Mapper was designed and manufactured by Santa Barbara Research Center.

==Mission==
===Launch===
Landsat 6 was launched aboard a Titan II launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 5, 1993.

===Operations===
Landsat 6 separated from the Titan II launch vehicle as programmed, but an explosion in its liquid fuel system upon separation doomed the satellite. Martin Marietta and NOAA both convened review boards to investigate the failure. Both boards determined that Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit due to a ruptured hydrazine manifold, and recommended a task force to investigate hydrazine feed systems that were considered &quot;safe and failure-free&quot;.

<text>Pak Se-ri or Se-ri Pak (, ; born 28 September 1977) is a South Korean former professional golfer who played on the LPGA Tour from 1998 to 2016. She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Career==
Born in Taejon, she attended in that city and then in Kongju City, Chungnam Province, where she was the school&#x27;s best amateur golfer. She then moved to Seoul for training. 
Pak turned professional in 1996, a year before she moved to the U.S. as a 20-year-old. In 1996 and 1997, she won six tournaments on the LPGA of Korea Tour. Pak joined the LPGA Tour full-time for the year 1998, crowning her rookie season with victories in two majors: the McDonald&#x27;s LPGA Championship and U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. At just 20 years of age, she became the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. About.com writes that &quot;Pak won a 20-hole playoff for that victory, making that tournament - at 92 holes in length - the longest tournament ever in women&#x27;s professional golf.&quot; Four days after the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open win, Pak shot a then-LPGA record 61 during the second round of the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic. She won the Rolex Rookie of the Year award for that season.

Since 1998, she has gone on to win 21 more events on the Tour, including three more majors. In June 2007, at age 29, she qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame, surpassing Karrie Webb as the youngest living entrant ever. (Tom Morris, Jr., who died in 1875 at the age of 24, had been elected in 1975.)

Pak has also competed in a professional men&#x27;s event, at the 2003 SBS Super Tournament on the Korean Tour. The Korean Tour was a feeder tour for the Asian Tour and did not offer world ranking points. She finished 10th in the event, according to the World Golf Hall of Fame &quot;becoming the first woman to make the cut in a professional men&#x27;s tournament since Babe Zaharias did so in 1945.&quot;

At the 2005 McDonald&#x27;s LPGA Championship, she missed the cut for the first time in 29 majors. In an interview quoted on the PGA Tour&#x27;s website, she commented that she was searching for a balance between her golf and her personal life: &quot;I&#x27;ve been a little bit unhappy about everything, my game, big game. I&#x27;m not really enjoying it at all, and I&#x27;m not doing anything with my ability. I know what I needed, a much better balance. I&#x27;m always putting a lot of pressure on myself&quot;. Eventually, she was found to have a finger injury. In 2006, she rediscovered her best form by winning the McDonald&#x27;s LPGA Championship for the third time to claim her fifth major title overall.

In 2007, she won the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic for the fifth time, making her the fourth player in LPGA history to win the same tournament five or more times (Annika Sörenstam accomplished this feat at two tournaments).

Perhaps the greatest tribute to her career to date came in a column by &quot;Golf World&quot; writer Eric Adelson in 2008, who called Pak &quot;a pioneer... who changed the face of golf even more than Tiger Woods.&quot; When Pak came to the LPGA in 1998, she was the only South Korean player. Ten years later, she was one of 45 South Koreans on tour, and the single largest source of revenue for the LPGA was the sale of TV rights in South Korea.

Pak was the only South Korean on the LPGA Tour in the year 1998. Her spectacular triumph at the 1998 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open encouraged many South Korean women to take up golf as a sport. She is regarded as a leader of the game in her home country and has also inspired the new generations of LPGA players Na Yeon Choi and Inbee Park who have followed her footsteps at the LPGA level. A statue of her now stands outside Gongju&#x27;s stadium. This statue commemorates her signature moment: a successful shot from a water hazard to remain tied for first place in the 1998 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open; this allowed her to force a sudden death playoff which she then won with &quot;a tremendous birdie putt from nearly 20 feet on the second hole.&quot; This was a victory named by the &quot;Korea Times&quot; as the 3rd most acclaimed moment in 60 years of South Korean sports history. Her shot was shown as the basis for the first episode of the South Korean TV drama &quot;Birdie Buddy&quot;.

On 17 March 2016, Pak announced that she would retire following the 2016 season. She retired the following 13 October, after completing the first round of South Korea&#x27;s lone LPGA-sanctioned event, the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship.

<doc id="1171594" wikidata="Q6518134" url="?curid=1171594" title="Legion of Frontiersmen">
<text>The Legion of Frontiersmen is a civilian nationalist paramilitary organisation formed in Britain in 1905 by Roger Pocock, a former North-West Mounted Police constable and Boer War veteran. Prompted by fears of an impending invasion of Britain and the Empire, the organisation was founded to be a field intelligence corps that would watch over and protect the boundaries of the Empire. Headquartered in London, the Legion of Frontiersmen formed branches throughout the Empire to prepare enlistees for war and foster vigilance in peacetime. Despite their efforts, the Legion never achieved significant official recognition, in part because many Commonwealth nations&#x27; laws prohibit militia groups.

Casualties in the First World War devastated the Legion of Frontiersmen, and except for a brief resurgence in the interwar period, a series of schisms and sectarianism prevented attempts to reinvigorate the movement. In the late 1930s, the Legion of Frontiersmen in Canada was formally affiliated with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but after a schism split within the Canadian Frontiersmen, the RCMP severed formal ties. Various Legion of Frontiersmen groups still exist throughout the Commonwealth, but as a whole, it has been unable to define its niche post World War II; especially because the organisation generally refuses to provide information about its activities to prospective applicants.

== First World War ==

During the First World War, the Legion of Frontiersmen helped raise and fill the ranks of the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, the 19th Alberta Dragoons, the 49th Battalion - Canadian Expeditionary Force (today&#x27;s Loyal Edmonton Regiment), the 210th Battalion (Frontiersmen), - Canadian Expeditionary Force, the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, and the Newfoundland Regiment. Despite the nature of the organisation, many of its members had no military experience and were probably no better (or worse) than other recruits to other wartime raised units.

== Uniforms ==

The earliest official description of an authorized uniform for a Canadian unit is noted in &quot;The Frontiersman&quot;,
(December 1912, page 223) describing Vernon and Okanagan Command&#x27;s uniform as follows:
&quot;Shirt Tunic – To be of substantial material, colour navy blue; leather buttons; nickel shoulder chains. Breeches or (Trousers) – Any shade of khaki.
Footwear – Brown leather; any combination that affords cover as high as the calves.
Headdress – Straight brim Stetson, any shade of brown, with leather band and regimental crest and monogram.
Accessories – Brown leather fringed gauntlets; silk blue and white &quot;bird&#x27;s-eye&quot; neckerchief; regulation LF holster.&quot;

== Decorations ==
Branches of the legion, in different parts of the Commonwealth award medals within their units and occasionally to external branches, commands, or units. The Australian Division awards a decoration called the &quot;Australian Medal of Merit&quot; and within the organisation has used the post nominal letters AMM. On occasion, such medal names and use of post nominal letters has caused controversy.

<doc id="1171598" wikidata="Q489982" url="?curid=1171598" title="Hyundai Asan">
<text>Hyundai Asan () is an arm of the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai Group and a major investor in North Korea. The company manages a number of projects, including the resort at the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region and road/rail building operations. It is also involved in the Kaesong Industrial Park project.

==Hyundai split==
The family-controlled Hyundai Group, which used to be South Korea&#x27;s largest Chaebol, was split into three sub-groups after the Asian financial crisis. Chung Mong-hun was involved in a power struggle with his elder brother, Chung Mong-koo, who heads another part of the Hyundai Group, the automaker Hyundai Motor Company.

==Accusations of corruption==

Hyundai Asan has faced accusations of being a vehicle for illegally transferring US$100 million to North Korea from the government of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The money was supposedly used to persuade North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to attend the inter-Korean summit in 2000. Hyundai Asan is building an industrial park, cross-border roads and railway lines in North Korea. The delay of the projects, due to political difficulties, put severe financial strains on the company. The head of Hyundai Asan, Chung Mong-hun, faced corruption and embezzlement charges. Chung was tried on charges of manipulating company accounting records to hide the secret transfers and embezzling more than twelve million dollars of company funds to pay bribes. On August 4, 2003, he committed suicide by leaping from his 12th floor office.

==Kaesong Industrial Park==
Hyundai Asan was hired by North Korea to develop the land for Kaesong Industrial Park close to the border with South Korea in the early 2000s. With this Industrial Park, a total of 124 firms took advantage of low-cost labor available in the North employing around 54,000 people from DPRK to compete with China to create low-end goods such as shoes, clothes, and watches before its abrupt closure in February 2016.

<doc id="1171612" wikidata="Q754031" url="?curid=1171612" title="Atelectasis">
<text>Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absence in gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. It is often referred to as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse, and that ambiguous term is also informally used for a fully collapsed lung caused by a pneumothorax.

It is a very common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. Although frequently described as a &quot;collapse of lung tissue&quot;, atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, which is a more specific condition that can cause atelectasis. Acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. In premature babies, this leads to infant respiratory distress syndrome.

The term uses combining forms of &quot;atel-&quot; + &quot;&quot;, from , &quot;incomplete&quot; + ἔκτασις, &quot;extension&quot;.
==Signs and symptoms==
May have no signs and symptoms or they may include:
* cough, but not prominent;
* chest pain (not common);
* breathing difficulty (fast and shallow);
* low oxygen saturation;
* pleural effusion (transudate type);
* cyanosis (late sign);
* increased heart rate.

It is a common misconception and pure speculation that atelectasis causes fever. This claim has been perpetuated in medical textbooks as recently as 2010. A review article published in 2011 summarizing the available evidence on the association between atelectasis and post-operative fever concluded that there is no clinical evidence supporting this speculation. A recent article outlined the history of this myth and the true causes of post-operative fever. 

==Causes==
The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, characterized by splinting, i.e. restricted breathing after abdominal surgery. Atelectasis develops in 75–90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure.

Another common cause is pulmonary tuberculosis. Smokers and the elderly are also at an increased risk. Outside of this context, atelectasis implies some blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, which can be within the airway (foreign body, mucus plug), from the wall (tumor, usually squamous cell carcinoma) or compressing from the outside (tumor, lymph node, tubercle). Another cause is poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, causing the surface tension to be at its highest which tends to collapse smaller alveoli. Atelectasis may also occur during suction, as along with sputum, air is withdrawn from the lungs. There are several types of atelectasis according to their underlying mechanisms or the distribution of alveolar collapse; resorption, compression, microatelectasis and contraction atelectasis. Relaxation atelectasis (also called passive atelectasis) is when a pleural effusion or a pneumothorax disrupts the contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae.

Risk factors associated with increased likelihood of the development of atelectasis include: type of surgery (thoracic, cardiopulmonary surgeries), use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, the lower lung segments.

Factors also associated with the development of atelectasis include: age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.

In the early 1950s, in UK aviation medicine, the condition acceleration atelectasis was given the name &quot;Hunter lung&quot; due to its prevalence in pilots of the transonic fighter jet, the Hawker Hunter, which used a 100% oxygen supply.

==Diagnosis==

Clinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray; findings can include lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. Post-surgical atelectasis will be bibasal in pattern. Chest CT or bronchoscopy may be necessary if the cause of atelectasis is not clinically apparent. Direct signs of atelectasis include displacement of interlobar fissures and mobile structures within the thorax, overinflation of the unaffected ipsilateral lobe or contralateral lung, and opacification of the collapsed lobe. In addition to clinically significant findings on chest X-rays, patients may present with indirect signs and symptoms such as elevation of the diaphragm, shifting of the trachea, heart and mediastinum; displacement of the hilus and shifting granulomas.

===Classification===

Atelectasis is broadly categorized into obstructive (resorptive) and nonobstructive types. It may be further classified as an acute or chronic condition. In acute atelectasis, the lung has recently collapsed and is primarily notable only for airlessness. In chronic atelectasis, the affected area is often characterized by a complex mixture of airlessness, infection, widening of the bronchi (bronchiectasis), destruction, and scarring (fibrosis).

==== Obstructive (absorptive/resorptive) atelectasis ====
This type is defined by blockage of the airway with air trapping and subsequent absorption of air distal to the obstruction. The resulting absorption of air distal to the obstruction results in collapse of the alveoli. It is most commonly due to intrathoracic tumors, aspiration of a foreign body, or mucus plugs. Children are notably more susceptible to atelectasis due to poorly developed collateral airways, which protect against alveolar collapse by maintaining inflation. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is mainly composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen (+ 1% argon and traces of other gases). Since oxygen is exchanged at the alveoli-capillary membrane, nitrogen is a major component for the alveoli&#x27;s state of inflation. If a large volume of nitrogen in the lungs is replaced with oxygen, the oxygen may subsequently be absorbed into the blood, reducing the volume of the alveoli, resulting in a form of alveolar collapse known as absorption atelectasis.

====Acute atelectasis====
There are four types of acute atelectasis: absorption atelectasis, compressive atelectasis, contraction atelectasis, and patchy atelectasis.

=====Compressive (relaxation) atelectasis=====
It is usually associated with accumulation of blood, fluid, or air within the pleural cavity, which mechanically collapses the lung. This is a frequent occurrence with pleural effusion, caused by congestive heart failure (CHF). Leakage of air into the pleural cavity (pneumothorax) also leads to compression atelectasis.

=====Cicatrization (contraction) atelectasis=====
This type occurs when either local or generalized fibrotic changes in the lung or pleura hamper expansion and increase elastic recoil during expiration. Causes include granulomatous disease, necrotising pneumonia and radiation fibrosis.

=====Patchy (adhesive) atelectasis=====
This type of atelectasis is due to lack of surfactant, as occurs in hyaline membrane disease of newborn or acute (adult) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

====Chronic atelectasis====
Chronic atelectasis may take one of two forms: right middle lobe syndrome, or rounded atelectasis.

=====Right middle lobe syndrome=====
In right middle lobe syndrome, the middle lobe of the right lung contracts, usually because of pressure on the bronchus from enlarged lymph glands and occasionally a tumor. The blocked, contracted lung may develop pneumonia that fails to resolve completely and leads to chronic inflammation, scarring, and bronchiectasis.

=====Rounded atelectasis=====
In rounded atelectasis (folded lung or Blesovsky syndrome), an outer portion of the lung slowly collapses as a result of scarring and shrinkage of the membrane layers covering the lungs (pleura), which would show as visceral pleural thickening and entrapment of lung tissue. This produces a rounded appearance on X-ray that doctors may mistake for a tumor. Rounded atelectasis is usually a complication of asbestos-induced disease of the pleura, but it may also result from other types of chronic scarring and thickening of the pleura.

==Treatment==
Treatment is directed at correcting the underlying cause. In atelectasis manifestations that result from the mucus plugging of the airways as seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and pneumonia, mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (NAC) is used. This nebulized treatment works by reducing mucous viscosity and elasticity by breaking disulfide bonds in mucoproteins within the mucus complex, thus facilitating mucus clearance. Post-surgical atelectasis is treated by physiotherapy, focusing on deep breathing and encouraging coughing. An incentive spirometer is often used as part of the breathing exercises. Walking is also highly encouraged to improve lung inflation. People with chest deformities or neurologic conditions that cause shallow breathing for long periods may benefit from mechanical devices that assist their breathing.

The primary treatment for acute massive atelectasis is correction of the underlying cause. A blockage that cannot be removed by coughing or by suctioning the airways often can be removed by bronchoscopy. Antibiotics are given for an infection. Chronic atelectasis is often treated with antibiotics because infection is almost inevitable. In certain cases, the affected part of the lung may be surgically removed when recurring or chronic infections become disabling or bleeding is significant. If a tumor is blocking the airway, relieving the obstruction by surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or laser therapy may prevent atelectasis from progressing and recurrent obstructive pneumonia from developing.

<text>Green Island is an island off the northwest coast of Kennedy Town, Hong Kong Island, separated by the Sulphur Channel. A smaller island nearby to the east, uninhabited, is called Little Green Island (). Administratively, the two islands are part of Central and Western District.
== Buildings ==
Green Island is largely uninhabited and at the east coast is Green Island Reception Centre and Green Island Police Station. On the top of the hill is an office of the Marine Department and a lighthouse southwest guides the ships in Sulphur Channel.

=== Lighthouse compound ===

The buildings of the Green Island Lighthouse Compound were declared as monuments, In 2008. The historic buildings include the two lighthouses built in 1875 and 1905 and the European quarters of the lighthouse compound. These three buildings are individually Grade II historic buildings.

The first lighthouse, tall and constructed of granite, began operation on 1 July 1875. There are two cross-shaped openings on its wall for ventilation and lighting. The openings resemble gun-posts like those found in medieval European castles. These are of the same construction as those found on the Cape Collinson Lighthouse at Siu Sai Wan, Hong Kong Island. It was later disused in 1905 because the building was too small to carry the lens from the Cape D&#x27;Aguilar Lighthouse.

Construction began on a second lighthouse in 1904, completed in 1905, which was originally intended to house the Cape D’Aguilar light. Built of granite and concrete, sitting beside its predecessor, the newer lighthouse is tall, painted white, with a steel-caged lantern on top. A concrete spiral staircase with rails gives access to the lantern room. An upper floor was added to the keeper&#x27;s house in 1923 and the lighthouse was automated in the 1970s. The two lighthouses, along with Cape D&#x27;Aguilar Lighthouse, Waglan Island Lighthouse and Tang Lung Chau Lighthouse (Kap Sing Lighthouse) are the only prewar lighthouses remaining.

===Living quarters and house===
The keeper&#x27;s house has a flat roof and is designed in an &#x27;L&#x27; shape. The house has arched windows and hanging eaves.

The quarters was converted to the Police Recreation Centre for an unknown time. It is currently leased to the Wu Oi Christian Centre as a youth drug treatment rehabilitation centre.

===Green Island Reception Centre===
The Green Island Reception Centre () was historically used as a temporary reception centre for Vietnamese refugees. As of 1997, it was used to accommodate Vietnamese illegal immigrants (VIIs) temporarily for quarantine purposes. The Centre was then managed by the CSD.

== Flora and fauna ==

The island is densely covered with woodland and tall scrub. A total of 150 plant species and a large variety of butterfly species has been found. One ant species not previously found elsewhere in Hong Kong was recorded on Green Island. The locally rare reef egret and white-bellied sea eagle have been seen on the island.

== Air traffic ==
Green Island is an important reporting point for location aviation in Hong Kong for entry to Victoria Harbour by air. All local traffic flying into or out of the harbour must report overhead Green Island. As the harbour is quite narrow and aviation traffic can be heavy at times due to the large number of helicopters and light aircraft, Green Island can also act as a holding point before permission to enter is granted by air traffic control.

== Weather station ==
== Shelved reclamation plan ==
In the 1990s, the Hong Kong Government proposed reclaiming approximately of land from Sulphur Channel to provide accommodation for a population of 103,465 and more road infrastructure. This included a coastal highway from Kennedy Town to Aberdeen (then called Route 7) and a fourth cross-harbour tunnel to a proposed container port at North Lantau. This proposal was shelved due to strong opposition from environmental concern groups.

<text>Green Island in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, is an island at the junction of the Rideau River, just off Sussex Drive in Ottawa at the Rideau Falls at the confluence with the Ottawa River. It is situated near the neighbourhood of New Edinburgh.

To the west of the island is the National Research Council, and Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada); to the east is 24 Sussex Drive and the embassy of France. On either side of the falls are facilities for a hydroelectric power plant.

Down the Rideau river are the ruins of a rail bridge that once led to Ottawa&#x27;s Union Station.

==Commemorations==
Green Island has several commemorations including:
* the Mackenzie-Papineau Monument to Canadian veterans of the Spanish Civil War, 
* the Ottawa Memorial was erected in the form of a huge bronze globe by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and Public Works Canada. The memorial was unveiled by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on July 1, 1959. The Ottawa Memorial commemorates approximately 800 men and women who were in active service or in training with the Commonwealth air forces in Canada, the Caribbean and the United States, who died during the Second World War. They have no known grave, or were buried at remote crash sites that are considered to be inaccessible.
* the National Artillery Monument was unveiled by Major-General Georges P. Vanier on September 21, 1959, in Major&#x27;s Hill Park. The Monument was moved to Green Island in 1997 as part of the National Capital Commission’s restructuring plan. On 24 May 1998, the monument was rededicated on Green Island. On November 11 of each year, a memorial service is held at National Artillery Monument immediately following the national ceremony at the Cenotaph. A wreath is laid by the Colonel Commandant or the Director of Artillery on behalf of The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery.
* A sculpture of Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae by Ruth Abernethy was erected in 2015 with his dress as an artillery officer and his medical bag nearby, as he writes In Flanders Fields. The statue shows the destruction of the battlefield and, at his feet, the poppies which are a symbol of Remembrance of World War I and all armed conflict since.

==Ottawa City Hall (1958–2001)==

Green Island was the location of Old City Hall, of the old city of Ottawa, before the amalgamation of the region in 2001. After considering 36 different locations, Green Island was confirmed as the new location of Ottawa City Hall on January 31, 1956. The official sod-turning ceremony was held on September 16, 1956. Construction was completed in 1958. City Council held its first meeting at the new location on July 21, 1958. Princess Margaret officially opened the stone and glass building, which featured a marble spiral staircase leading to the second floor, on August 2, 1958. This building remained Ottawa’s City Hall until municipal amalgamation came into effect on January 1, 2001. The building of an expensive addition to the city hall (designed by Moshe Safdie), the architect of the National Gallery of Canada shortly before the building was decommissioned was a source of controversy in the city.

<text>Green Island, also known as North Brewster Island, is a rocky outer island in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, to the north of Calf Island and Hypocrite Channel. The island has a permanent size of , plus an intertidal zone of a further , and is exposed from the east and northeast with little soil or plant life. The island is named after Joseph Green, a well-known merchant, who owned the island during Colonial times.

Green Island is a nesting area for herring gulls, black-backed gulls, cormorants, barn swallows, red-winged blackbirds, and rats. The island is a popular location for striped bass fishermen during the summer months. However, access by humans is difficult, and especially discouraged during the birds&#x27; nesting season.

==History==

Due to the severity of the cold weather during the winter of 1865, Samuel Choat had to be removed from Green Island. He was 70 years of age at the time. On February 8, Choat was transferred to the State Almshouse in Bridgewater where he died on February 23, 1865.

<doc id="1171622" wikidata="Q244522" url="?curid=1171622" title="Zvi Hirsch Kalischer">
<text>Zvi (Zwi) Hirsch Kalischer (Hebrew:צבי הירש קלישר)(24 March 1795 – 16 October 1874) was an Orthodox German rabbi who expressed views, from a religious perspective, in favour of the Jewish re-settlement of the Land of Israel, which predate Theodor Herzl and the Zionist movement. He was the grandfather of Salomon Kalischer.
==Life==
Kalischer was born in Lissa in the Prussian Province of Posen (now Leszno in Poland). Destined for the rabbinate, he received his Talmudic education from Jacob of Lissa and Rabbi Akiva Eiger of Posen.

It is suggested that Kalischer&#x27;s early life in an area which was annexed by Prussia, introduced him to the modern ideas of emancipation and enlightenment emanating from Berlin. This encounter with modern ideas together with his traditional Talmudic scholarship serve as the background for his eventual fusion of Eastern European Jewish longing for redemption and Western European nationalistic and social values. 

After his marriage he left Jacob of Lissa and settled in Thorn, a city on the Vistula River, then in Prussia and now Toruń, in northern Poland, where he spent the rest of his life.

In Toruń, he took an active interest in the affairs of the Jewish community, and for more than forty years held the office of &quot;Rabbinatsverweser&quot; (&quot;acting rabbi&quot;). Disinterestedness was a prominent feature of his character; he refused to accept any remuneration for his services. His wife, by means of a small business, provided their meager subsistence.
The name &quot;Zvi Hirsh&quot; is a bilingual tautological name in Yiddish. It means literally &quot;deer-deer&quot; and is traceable back to the Hebrew word צבי &quot;tsvi&quot; &quot;deer&quot; and the German word &quot;Hirsch&quot; &quot;deer&quot;.

==Works==
In his youth he wrote &quot;Eben Bochan&quot;, a commentary on several juridical themes of the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;, &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; (Krotoschin, 1842), and &quot;Sefer Moznayim la-Mishpat&quot;, a commentary, in three parts on the whole &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; (parts i. and ii., Krotoschin and Königsberg, 1855; part iii. still in manuscript). He also wrote: &quot;Tzvi L&#x27;Tzadik&quot; (צבי לצדיק) glosses on the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;, Yoreh De&#x27;ah, published in the new Vilna edition of that work; the &quot;Sefer ha-Berit&quot; commentary on the Pentateuch; the &quot;Sefer Yetzi&#x27;at Mitzrayim&quot; commentary on the Passover Pesach Haggadah; &quot;Chiddushim&quot; on several Talmudical treatises; etc. He also contributed largely to Hebrew magazines, as &quot;Ha-Maggid&quot;, &quot;Tziyyon&quot;, &quot;Ha-&#x27;Ibri&quot;, and &quot;Ha-Lebanon&quot;.

==Views on the re-settlement of the Land of Israel ==
Inclined to philosophical speculation, Kalischer studied the systems of medieval and modern Jewish and Christian philosophers, one result being his &quot;Sefer Emunah Yesharah&quot;, an inquiry into Jewish philosophy and theology (2 vols., Krotoschin, 1843, 1871); an appendix to volume 1 contains a commentary (incomplete) on Job and Ecclesiastes.

In the midst of his many activities, however, his thoughts centered on one idea: the settlement of the Land of Israel by Jews, in order to provide a home for the homeless Eastern European Jews and transform the many Jewish beggars in the Holy Land into a population which would be able to support itself by practicing agriculture.

He wrote in the &quot;Ha-Levanon&quot;, a Hebrew (at that period, a renovated language) monthly magazine. In 1862 he published his book &quot;Derishat Tzion&quot; (Lyck, 1862) on this subject, including many quotes from his commentaries in the &quot;Ha-Levanon&quot; magazine. He proposed:
#To collect money for this purpose from Jews in all countries
#To buy and cultivate land in Israel
#To found an agricultural school, either in Israel itself or in France, and
#To form a Jewish military guard for the security of the colonies.

He thought the time was especially favorable for the carrying out of this idea, as the sympathy of men like Isaac Moïse Crémieux, Moses Montefiore, Edmond James de Rothschild, and Albert Cohn rendered the Jews politically influential. To these and similar Zionist ideals he gave expression in his &quot;Derishat Zion&quot;, containing three theses:

#The salvation of the Jews, which was promised by the Prophets, can only come about in a natural way — by self-help
#Immigration to Israel
#Admissibility of the observance of sacrifices in Jerusalem at the present day.

The appendix contains an invitation to the reader to become a member of the colonization societies of Israel.

The second part of the book is devoted to speaking to &quot;the nations&quot; which believe in the Bible and the prophets, and persuading them, that this new course in history is a logical one, and they too can hope for the salvation of the Jewish nation as part of the salvation of the entire world.

This book made a very great impression, especially in Eastern Europe. It was translated into German by Poper (Toruń, 1865), and a second Hebrew edition was issued by N. Friedland (Toruń, 1866). Kalischer himself traveled with indefatigable zeal to various German cities for the purpose of establishing colonization societies. It was his influence that caused Chayyim Lurie (Chaim Lorje 1821-1878) to form the first society of this kind (Association for the Colonisation of Palestine) in Frankfurt in 1860, and this was followed by the formation of other societies.

Owing to Kalischer&#x27;s agitation, the Alliance Israélite Universelle founded the Mikveh Israel agricultural school in Palestine in 1870. He was offered the rabbinate, but he was too old to accept it. Although not all of these endeavors were attended with immediate success, Kalischer never lost hope. By exerting a strong influence upon his contemporaries, including such prominent men as Heinrich Grätz, Moses Hess (see &quot;Rome and Jerusalem&quot;, pp. 117 et seq.), and others, he is considered to have been one of the most important of those who prepared the way for the foundation of modern Zionism.

== Notable Opposition ==
Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was vocally opposed to Kalischer&#x27;s proto-zionistic views, writing “We are obligated to follow the ‘well-trodden paths of our ancestors and early leaders,’ who never mentioned any obligation for us to encourage the geulah (&quot;redemption)&quot; by developing Eretz Yisroel. They mention as the path toward the Redemption only that we become better Jews, repent, and look forward to the geulah.”

<text>Linda Elin Ulvaeus (born 23 February 1973) is a Swedish actress and singer. She is the elder child of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, members of the pop group ABBA.

== Early life ==
Ulvaeus is the only daughter of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog. She was born in Danderyd Hospital in Danderyd. Her younger brother, Peter Christian Ulvaeus, was born on 4 December 1977.

== Career ==
Ulvaeus made her musical debut in 1981 at the age of 8, releasing the album she recorded alongside her mother the previous year, &quot;Nu tändas tusen juleljus&quot; (&quot;Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit&quot;). The album, which was produced by Fältskog alongside Michael B. Tretow, consisted of 18 traditional Christmas carols and children&#x27;s songs in Swedish. Although the album had been recorded in November 1980 (when Ulvaeus was seven years old), it was not released until the following October.

She is the inspiration behind the song &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot;, written by her father and recorded by her parents&#x27; band ABBA.

Ulvaeus has since established herself as a stage and screen actress. Her acting debut came in the film &quot;Under solen&quot; (1998) in the role of Lena. She then appeared in the television series &quot;Labyrinten&quot; in 2000. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Blå måndag&quot; (2001), released directly to video.

Ulvaeus was a backing vocalist on her mother&#x27;s 2004 comeback single, &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, which reached #11 in Sweden. Ulvaeus returned to the big screen in the role of Sofia in the film &quot;Meningen med alltihopa&quot; (2006). She later appeared in the television series &quot;Playa del Sol&quot; in 2007. Ulvaeus again returned to the big screen, playing Birgitta Ståle in the Swedish film &quot;Quick&quot; (2019).

<doc id="1171651" wikidata="Q1722254" url="?curid=1171651" title="Czech Dream">
<text>Czech Dream () is a 2004 documentary film directed by two Czech film directors, Vít Klusák and Filip Remunda. It recorded a large-scale hoax perpetrated by Klusák and Remunda on the Czech public, culminating in the opening event of a fake hypermarket in the Letňany neighborhood of Prague. The film was their graduation project for film school.

== Concept ==
Remunda and Klusák invented the &quot;Český sen&quot; (&quot;Czech dream&quot;) hypermarket and created a massive advertising campaign around it. Posing as businessmen, the two film students managed to persuade an ad agency and a public relations agency to create a campaign for them. Billboards appeared on Czech highways, and 200,000 pamphlets were distributed in Prague. A jingle was recorded, and there was a series of television commercials. The advertising campaign slogans were &quot;don&#x27;t come&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t spend&quot;, etc.

Still, the filmmakers succeeded in attracting more than 3000 shoppers to an empty plain for their &quot;grand opening&quot; on 31 May 2003. What looked like a huge building from a distance was actually only a canvas facade backed by scaffolding.

When the &quot;customers&quot; finally realized that they had been deceived, they reacted in different ways. Some understood the filmmakers&#x27; message, some tried to take it optimistically (&quot;At least we had some fresh air&quot;), but most were angry, and many decided to blame the government. Still, there was no violence against the authors.

==Prizes==
The film won prizes at festivals in Kraków, Jihlava, Ljubljana, Århus, and Plzeň.

<text>Ezekial Dann Florek (born May 1, 1950) is an American actor and film director. He is best known for his role as New York City Police Captain Donald Cragen on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and its spinoff &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and Dave Meyer on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; (1988–1993).

==Early life==
Florek was born in Flat Rock, Michigan, the son of Leonard Florek, a chiropractor, and Darlene Florek. He attended Eastern Michigan University where he majored in math and physics, but never graduated. He moved to New York City to pursue an acting career in the theatre.

==Career==
In the 1980s, Florek performed supporting roles in films such as &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot;, &quot;Moon Over Parador&quot; and &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. He also played Mr. Slate in the live-action film version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

Florek played Dave Meyer, the husband of Susan Ruttan&#x27;s character, Roxanne Melman, on 22 episodes of NBC&#x27;s hit drama &quot;L.A. Law&quot; beginning in 1988. Florek also had a recurring role in the WB sitcom &quot;Smart Guy&quot; as the high school gym coach, and appeared in several episodes of &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

===&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;===
Starting in 1990, Florek co-starred in the NBC police procedural and legal drama television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; as Capt. Don Cragen.

The first few years of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; had mediocre ratings and finally, after the close of the 1992–1993 season, NBC told creator/executive producer Dick Wolf that they would cancel it unless he added a few women to the all-male cast. Wolf reluctantly complied and fired Florek as well as Richard Brooks (who played Paul Robinette), replacing them with S. Epatha Merkerson and Jill Hennessy, respectively. However, Florek was allowed to direct a few &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episodes in 1994 and 1995.

Florek reprised the role of Cragen in the 1995 episode &quot;Bad Faith&quot; (which he also directed), and in the 1998 TV-movie &quot;&quot;, centered on the character Mike Logan, played by Chris Noth. 

In 1999, he returned to the Cragen role, only this time on the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; spin-off series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, as the titular unit&#x27;s captain. For the return of the Cragen character, Florek and Wolf created a backstory in which his wife, a flight attendant, was killed in a plane crash a few years previously, which drove Cragen, a recovering alcoholic, to start drinking again and to patronize prostitutes; he takes command of the Special Victims Unit in order to escape his addiction.

Florek was written out of the series during its 15th season, and his final episode aired on January 15, 2014. He reprised his role in the 21st episode of season 16 in May 2015. In the 500th episode of &quot;SVU&quot;, he appeared as Cragen in a video chat with his former detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), now captain of the unit. He also reprised the role of Cragen in an episode of the &quot;SVU&quot; spin-off &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot;, reuniting Cragen with his former detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) in April 2022. He subsequently appeared in the second season finale.

==Personal life==
Florek and his wife, Karen, live in Venice, Los Angeles. Karen works as an artist. His brother, Dave, is also an actor. All three trained at Eastern Michigan University.

Florek received an honorary Bachelor of Arts and an honorary Doctorate of Arts, on December 13, 2008, and December 14, 2008, respectively, from Eastern Michigan University at the school&#x27;s winter commencement ceremony. Florek was the keynote speaker at the event.
