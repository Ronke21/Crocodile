<text>The Wayne Corporation was an American manufacturer of buses and other vehicles under the &quot;Wayne&quot; marque. The corporate headquarters were in Richmond, Indiana, in Wayne County, Indiana. During the middle 20th century, Wayne served as a leading producer of school buses in North America.

Among innovations introduced by the company were the first application of cutaway van chassis for a school bus and an improvement in structural integrity in bus body construction, involving the use of continuous longitudinal panels to reduce body joints; the design change happened before federal standards required stronger body structures in school buses.

After 1980, Wayne faced difficulty competing in a market with overcapacity. Declaring bankruptcy, the company discontinued operations in 1992 and its assets were liquidated. Later in 1992, the Wayne brand was reorganized as Wayne Wheeled Vehicles, doing business through 1995.

== Overview ==

Wayne is a name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the United States and Canada. Beginning in the 19th century, craftsmen in Richmond, Indiana at Wayne Works and its successors built horse-drawn vehicles, including kid hacks, evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the 20th century. Wayne products eventually included school buses, transit buses, highway coaches, military and shuttle buses, ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the Middle East.

Among many innovations, Wayne pioneered the side-mounted guard rails of modern school buses, inboard wheelchair lifts, and high-headroom doors (a special accommodation for mobility-challenged persons requiring head and neck support from above). The company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis, the Wayne Busette, a body design that would set a precedent for small school bus design, more than 40 years after its introduction.

The crowning safety achievement was the &quot;Wayne Lifeguard&quot; structural body design introduced in 1973, which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels. The body design helped pave the way for U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for school buses, most of which became applicable on April 1, 1977. In the years after, Wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering.

Through nearly 160 years of existence, Wayne went through several ownership and name changes. From 1955 to 1975 alone, the business underwent periods under the ownership of Divco (as &quot;Divco-Wayne&quot;), Boise Cascade, &quot;Indian Head, Inc.&quot;, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Group.

In 1967, Wayne opened the largest school bus manufacturing facility in the United States; adjacent to Interstate 70, the factory became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers. During the 1980s, the company struggled against an industry downturn fueled by overcapacity and a difficult market cycle. Following millions of dollars of losses, Wayne Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1992.

During the 1990s, Wayne was briefly reorganized as Wayne Wheeled Vehicles, with the Richmond factory utilized by rival manufacturer Carpenter, building school buses from 1996 until its closure in 2000.

== Early history (1837-1956) ==

===1837-1900===

The ultimate beginning of Wayne Corporation traces back to 1837 in Dublin, Indiana, as the Witt family set up a foundry. Alongside the initial manufacturing of stoves, the foundry expanded its manufacturing to farm implements. Through the 1840s and 1850s, the foundry would undergo several changes of ownership. In 1868, the company produced its first vehicle, a horse-drawn utility wagon derived from the then-popular Conestoga wagon.

The 1870s saw two major events that would change the company forever. In 1871, Wayne Agricultural Company was founded out of a reorganization of the foundry ownership (deriving its name from Wayne County, Indiana). In 1875, Wayne Agricultural relocated its operations to Richmond, Indiana.

In the late 1880s, Wayne Agricultural fell into receivership and was nearly closed; in 1888, the company was reorganized as Wayne Works. In 1902, Wayne Works was forced to rebuild after a fire destroyed the factory.

====Kid hacks====
Following the closure of Wayne Agricultural in 1888, Wayne Works began focusing its product range from farm implements towards horse-drawn vehicles, including wagons and carriages. In 1892, Wayne Works was commissioned by an Ohio school district to build a wagon designed for student transport. Its &quot;School Car&quot; featured perimeter seating with wooden bench seats. Other wagons at the time adapted for transporting students were referred to as &quot;school hacks,&quot;,&quot;school trucks,&quot; or &quot;kid hacks.&quot;

=== 1900-1930: From wagons to buses ===

In 1902, Wayne Works was forced to completely rebuild after a fire destroyed the factory. Moving away from farm implements, the company began a transition towards the manufacturing of automobile bodies. In addition, the company began production of complete automobiles, with the Richmond built between 1901 and 1917. The Wayne County Historical Museum in Richmond, Indiana has a rare 1907 &quot;Richmond&quot; on display, along with horse-drawn &quot;kid hack&quot; also manufactured by the Wayne Works.

In 1922, Wayne introduced the Touring Home, a recreational vehicle derived from its bus body. By 1927, Wayne introduced the use of steel for its external body panels (combined with a wood internal frame).

==== First buses ====
In the 1910s, Wayne chose to become a body manufacturer for truck chassis (such as the Ford Model T). In 1914, alongside a line of commercial truck bodies, the company introduced its first motorized &quot;School Car&quot;, its first school bus mounted on an automotive chassis. In the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era, passengers sat on perimeter seating, facing the sides rather than the front of the bus. In place of wooden benches, the 1914 School Car was fitted with padded seats.

Entry and egress was through a door at the rear, a design first utilized from the days of wagons (to avoid startling the horses). This feature was retained, becoming the rear emergency exit seen on the buses of today; the primary mode of ingress/egress is now through a curbside door.

Following World War I, Wayne Works began to produce the School Car in large numbers; alongside changes in education funding and school modernization, the motorized school bus was a contributing factor in the decline of rural one-room schools in United States. Although fewer children lived within walking distance of school, school systems consisted of fewer but larger multi-room schools.

=== 1930s: Safety innovations ===
The 1930s marked a number of significant changes in school bus design. Among other manufacturers, Wayne would introduce changes that have remained part of school bus design, even decades later.

In 1930, Wayne Works became the first manufacturer to replace steel-sheathed bodies with full-steel construction, including the internal body frame. Initially offered as an option, the all-steel body became standard in 1933. In 1933, Wayne became the first manufacturer to offer an all-steel body with safety glass windows. In addition, the company began to phase in the heavy-duty reinforced side rails seen on school buses, &quot;collision rails&quot; or &quot;guard rails&quot; became an added safety feature.

For 1936, Wayne redesigned its school bus body, making it sectional, allowing a customer to add or remove sections for repair or change capacity. In 1937, the company produced its largest school bus, seating 115 students. In 1938, Wayne Works introduced its first forward-control school bus, offered as a second-party conversion on its conventional-chassis body. In contrast to later front-engine buses, the driver sat on top of the front axle (instead of before the front axle).

=== 1940s: Production transition ===

In April 1939, a school bus industry conference hosted by rural education expert Frank W. Cyr would change the design of the school bus forever. Although Wayne Works was not a participant, the results would lead to many industry-wide changes. Along with the adoption of chrome yellow as a standard color for school buses, the conference resulted in the development of a number of industry-wide standards, including the adoption of forward-facing seats and the standardization of many body dimensions.

==== World War II production ====

For World War II, as with other school bus manufacturers, Wayne Works retooled as a military supplier for the Armed Forces. From 1942 to 1945, Wayne would produce 22,857 ambulance bodies for the Dodge WC-54 4x4 chassis. The military also were supplied with other vehicles from the company, including mobile machine shops and buses. Along with conventional-chassis buses, Wayne produced trailer buses pulled by a semi-tractor; the latter buses could transport up to 150 passengers.

To conserve steel for war use, Wayne Works and other manufacturers reverted from all-steel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during World War II. The company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years, as did other bus body manufacturers. In 1944, as the end of World War II approached, Wayne returned to building all-steel bodies.

==== Post-war era ====
Following World War II, Wayne Works began to adapt for new markets for its vehicles. In 1948, Wayne entered a joint venture with Crown Coach to distribute a separate bus; the joint venture resulted in Crown becoming the West Coast distributor for Wayne. The same year, Welles Corporation of Windsor, Ontario became the sole Canadian distributor of Wayne Works school buses. Named for Halsey V. Welles (who founded H. V. Welles Ltd. in 1925), Welles Corporation was first established as Warford Corp. of Canada to distribute Warford transmissions.

=== 1950-1956: End of Wayne Works ===
In late 1950, Wayne Works changed hands, as the Jeffery Ives Corporation acquired Wayne Works from the Clements family, involved with the company ownership since 1897.

For 1952, the company introduced a redesigned bus body, introducing wraparound rear windows and an optional wraparound windshield.

In the mid-1950s, Wayne expanded beyond bus manufacturing, as it acquired two manufacturers of professional cars. In 1954, the company acquired Meteor Motor Car and A.J. Miller Company in 1956, merging them together as Miller-Meteor.

In 1956, Newton Glekel began negotiations with Divco to undergo a merger with Wayne Works. After having inspected the Richmond factory for a potential 1949 sale, the New York-based investor retained interest. At the time in the United States, Wayne controlled a 25% share of school bus manufacturing with Miller-Meteor controlling a 50% share of professional car manufacturing.

== Divco-Wayne Corporation (1956-1968) ==
In November 1956, under the leadership of Newton Glekel, a real estate investor from New York, completed a merger of Divco and Wayne Works, with Divco acquiring the assets of Wayne; a 26% share was owned by the law firm owned by Glekel. Under the merger, Wayne began business as the Divco-Wayne Corporation; by 1961, all management of the merged company came from Wayne, with Glekel serving as president.

=== Divco-Wayne structure ===
Following the merger, Divco-Wayne expanded into a manufacturing conglomerate; beyond its bus, professional car, and truck product lines, Divco-Wayne expanded into the manufacturing of mobile homes, recreational vehicles, and ambulances. Although Divco would continue the manufacturing of its namesake delivery vehicles, nearly all vehicle manufacturing was completed through Wayne and its professional car subsidiaries.

==== Delivery vehicles (Divco) ====

Divco stands for Detroit Industrial Vehicles COmpany. Founded in 1926, Divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles, with many examples built as milk trucks. At the time of the Divco-Wayne merger, 75% of milk delivery vehicles sold in the United States were manufactured by Divco.

First built in 1926, Divco produced its delivery trucks until 1986; only the Volkswagen Beetle remained in production under a single generation for longer. Divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today.

Following the 1956 merger, Divco-Wayne continued manufacturing of Divco trucks in its Detroit facility. From 1959 to 1961, the company produced the Divco Dividend bus, a Divco truck modified with seats and windows from Wayne buses.

In 1967, Divco-Wayne sold off its namesake truck manufacturing arm to air conditioning manufacturer Transairco. As part of the sale, Transairco shifted manufacturing of Divco trucks in 1969 from Detroit to Delaware, Ohio, lasting until 1986.

==== Bus manufacturing (Wayne) ====
As Wayne started out as the Wayne Agricultural Works in the 19th century, all manufacturing had been centralized at its facility in Richmond, Indiana. Most bus bodies consisted of in-house manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others, combined into bus bodies in assembly operations. Thus, the major two functions of the Richmond, Indiana plant were manufacturing of parts, and assembly. Wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the US and at a Canadian assembly plant, Welles, Ltd. in Windsor, Ontario. Kits were also shipped overseas even after all North American assembly was eventually centralized in Richmond, Indiana and Windsor, Ontario in the early 1960s.

During the earlier years of the school bus industry, the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body, but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the United States and Canada, for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis. Gradually, as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical, and school bus bodies became more sophisticated, the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the United States and Canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies. The companies often continued to ship &quot;kits&quot; overseas.

By the mid-1960s, several other body companies (notably Blue Bird Body Company and Perley A. Thomas Car Works) maintained assembly plants at multiple locations. Instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the U.S., Wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged Wayne Works facility on E Street near downtown Richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and assembly for United States production. Due primarily to Canadian import tariffs, the separate Canadian assembly plant (Welles, Ltd.) had been established and was maintained for Canadian production. In 1963, Divco-Wayne acquired Welles entirely, making it a subsidiary of the company.

==== Professional cars ====
The professional car (quoted from a leading trade association) &quot;is loosely defined as a custom-bodied vehicle, based on passenger car styling, and used in the funeral, rescue or livery services.&quot; Such vehicles may be ambulances, funeral cars (hearses, flower cars, service cars), limousines, or combination cars, vehicles specially built to combine multiple functions (hearse-ambulances, sedan ambulances or invalid coaches). From the 1930s to the 1970s, a common starting point for such vehicles was the Cadillac Commercial Chassis (or similar vehicles); using a heavy-duty frame, the vehicle was a bare chassis aft of the dashboard, leaving all exterior and interior bodywork to be completed by coachbuilders (much of the vehicle was completed by hand).

Divco-Wayne Corporation acquired two professional car manufacturers, Miller-Meteor and Cotner-Bevington; both companies produced funeral cars and ambulances.

=====Miller-Meteor=====
Wayne Works purchased Meteor Motor Car Company in Piqua, Ohio in 1954. Meteor built professional cars, such as limousines and ambulances.

In 1956, Wayne acquired A.J. Miller&#x27;s professional car building company of Bellefontaine, Ohio. The A.J. Miller Company had begun in 1853 by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the 20th century. However, the small company found it could not compete in the general market with the larger automobile makers, so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances. Over the years the Miller hearses became known and used throughout the world. The Miller Co. was combined with Wayne&#x27;s existing professional car subsidiary, Meteor Motor Car Company, forming the new Miller-Meteor (M-M) division of Wayne.

Professional car manufacturers Miller and Meteor, newly combined as Miller-Meteor, were brought into the fold of Divco-Wayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field. Although the recently combined Miller-Meteor company was initially based at Bellefontaine, Ohio, originally the home of the A.J. Miller Company, under Divco-Wayne ownership, it was later relocated to Piqua, Ohio, Meteor&#x27;s old hometown nearby.

Ecto-1, the vehicle used by the protagonists in the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and its 1989 and sequels, is a 1959 Cadillac fitted with a Miller-Meteor ambulance body.

=====Cotner-Bevington=====

Divco-Wayne acquired Cotner-Bevington Coach Company (C-B) in 1965, making it a subsidiary of Wayne Corporation. Founded as Comet Coach Company, the coachbuilder sold the rights in 1959 to the &quot;Comet&quot; name&quot; to Ford Motor Company (which sought to use it for the Lincoln-Mercury Division); in 1960, the Mercury Comet was introduced. In response, Comet Coach renamed itself Cotner-Bevington Coach Company, taking on the names of its two founders; the company also relocated from Memphis, Tennessee, a few miles north to Blytheville, Arkansas.

At the time of its acquisition by Divco-Wayne, Cotner-Bevington specialized primarily in ambulances based on Oldsmobile commercial chassis.

In 1968, Wayne began production of truck-based ambulances, using the Cotner-Bevington facilities. For 1968, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; (based on the Chevrolet Suburban) was introduced, expanding to the &quot;Vanguard&quot; (based on the Chevrolet Van) in 1971, and &quot;Medicruiser&quot; (based on Dodge Ram Van) in 1973. The Sentinel received a headroom increase for 1971, but were only built through the 1972 model year. After that, the Sentinel brand name was used on Wayne&#x27;s line of Type I (pickup chassis) modular ambulances. Body shells were produced at the Richmond, Indiana, bus plant for Care-O-Van ambulance units, based upon cutaway chassis and Wayne Busette bodies.

In 1973, Wayne truck-based ambulance production moved to Piqua, Ohio, home to Miller-Meteor. C-B stayed in business through the 1975 model year, building only on Oldsmobile commercial chassis after 1964; all other production would become truck-based ambulances. In 1967, the company became the first coachbuilder to standardize air conditioning on all vehicles produced.

====Non-automotive divisions====
Divco-Wayne Corporation manufactured housing brands included Kozy, Elcar, Star, and National. The Divco-Wayne conglomerate also had a financial arm, Divco-Wayne Acceptance Corporation, which was also known as Divco-Wayne Financial, Wayne Acceptance or Financial Corporation and Wayne Financial Sales Corporation.

From 1958 to 1959, the company owned Divco-Wayne Electronics. In a $1.5 million purchase of the Electronics Division of Gruen Watch Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, Divco-Wayne sought to enter the aerospace technology segment. After poor results, the Electronics Division was sold off.

====Distribution network====
More than a few Wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors. ARA Transportation and Laidlaw were the largest. Others included Bus and Bodies of Plaistow, New Hampshire, Town &amp; Country Transportation of Warren, Rhode Island, Rohrer of Duncannon, Pennsylvania, Virginia Overland Transportation of Richmond, Virginia, and School Bus Services of Shawnee Mission, Kansas. These school bus contractors, several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services, found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at Wayne, as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods.

Wayne Export was a Divco-Wayne division which specialized in selling disassembled Wayne bodies knock-down kits (CKDs) outside North America. By 1957, Wayne bus bodies were in use in 60 different countries.

In 1963, Wayne licensed the Spanish S.A. Bosuga to build in Barcelona coach bodies based on Wayne&#x27;s technology and designs. These were marketed as Bosuga Wayne, utilizing mainly Pegaso and Barreiros-AEC chassis. The venture was short-lived since the Spanish market for coach bodies was crowded.

===Factory relocation===
As early as 1964, Divco-Wayne started plans for the construction of a new plant. In need for over 100 acres of land to build a factory, the company purchased a site in Florence, Kentucky. In response, $450,000 was raised by the community of Richmond and local UAW to persuade the company to build on a 100-acre parcel of land outside of the city, located near the intersection of Interstate 70 and US 35 northwest of the city.

In late 1964, construction began on the new facility, at a cost of $3.5 million. As it opened at the beginning of 1967, the new Richmond factory included assembly and manufacturing for all Wayne product lines under one roof, including steel manufacturing presses, rust-proofing equipment, and paint booths. Although export buses would remain shipped in CKD form (to ease shipping), the new factory allowed all buses to leave the factory fully assembled and driveable.

===Divco-Wayne breakup===
From 1967 to 1968, the makeup of Wayne Corporation would change significantly, changing hands twice within 2 years. At the end of 1966, Divco was put up for sale and sold to Transairco. At the beginning of 1967, Newton Glekel put the entirety of Divco-Wayne Corporation up for sale.

After several offers, the company was sold for $47.1 million in January 1968 to Boise Cascade, a wood-products manufacturer. As Boise Cascade had sought out Divco-Wayne for its manufactured-housing division, Wayne Corporation was resold in October 1968 for $15 million to Indian Head, Inc., a textile conglomerate. The sale included Wayne Corporation and its transportation-segment subsidiaries: Welles, Miller-Meteor, and Cotner-Bevington.

== Wayne Corporation (1968-1992) ==

===Indian Head ownership (1968-1975)===
Divco-Wayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sized-conglomerate, with all facilities basically within of Wayne&#x27;s Richmond, Indiana base. In contrast, Indian Head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased Wayne Corporation and its subsidiaries in 1968. Indian Head Inc. acquired Wayne Corp., which its history recorded as &quot;maker of school buses, ambulances, hearses, professional cars&quot; from Divco-Wayne.

====New-generation buses====
The late 1960s and early 1970s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses. Additionally, to improve the basic structural integrity of full-size school buses, Wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an all-new body design.

===== Small buses: Papoose and Busette =====

In the early 1970s, the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than 4 wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work: the step van. Essentially developed as a newer, larger generation of the Divco truck or IHC Metro van, the step van chassis was built with dual rear wheels and shipped to a body manufacturer with a bare frame. Often referred to as a &quot;P-chassis&quot;, step-van chassis were produced by both Ford or General Motors.

In 1969, Carpenter Body Works became the first company to build a school bus on a P-chassis, named the Cadet. In 1970, Wayne developed its own vehicle line for a Chevrolet P-chassis, named the Wayne Papoose. The front bodywork of the Papoose was designed in an effort to maximize forward visibility; in what would make for an unusual appearance, the front bodywork also maximized the use of flat glass and flat-paneled sheetmetal. Described by some observers as &quot;severe&quot; in its appearance, the Papoose earned other nicknames even less kind.

Although the Papoose failed to gain ground in the school bus segment and was discontinued in 1973, other school bus manufacturers would develop buses of a similar configuration by the end of the 1970s, with the Blue Bird Mini Bird and Carpenter Cadet remaining in production into the late 1990s.

Following the failure of the Papoose, Wayne chose to develop an even smaller school bus, becoming the first manufacturer to adapt a cutaway van chassis for school bus use. For 1973, the Busette was introduced, using Chevrolet/GMC and Dodge chassis. Prior to the Busette, small school buses were conversions of full-size vans or large SUVs (such as the Chevrolet Suburban or International Travelall). Using a cutaway chassis, the Busette placed a purpose-built bus body on a dual rear-wheel chassis; the wider rear axle provided an extra margin of stability and capability over converted passenger vehicles.

Following its introduction, the Busette (and its Transette commercial variant) set a design precedent for the configuration of all small buses, not just school buses. The Busette and Transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts.

=====Full-size buses: Lifeguard=====
In the early 1930s, Wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and all-metal construction into school bus design. While safer than wooden body construction, riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own; in a crash, a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together.

In 1967, safety engineers of Ward Body Works of Conway, Arkansas (a competing bus manufacturer) subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints. Ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners. This resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners.

As opposed to simply adding more fasteners, Wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely; essentially, the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal. The roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion: one piece, cut to length. Fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure, the guardrails, and at the rear of the bus.

In 1973, Wayne introduced the new design, branded the Lifeguard. Although Wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the Lifeguard&#x27;s body panels, the design also reduced overall body weight and man-hours required for assembly.

====Indian Head and Thyssen====
In 1973, Indian Head established a joint business venture with Thyssen-Bornemisza Group N.V., a Dutch holding company. In 1975, the rest of Indian Head Industries was sold to (and folded into) Thyssen-Bornemisza, a conglomerate based in Monaco, which was owned by one man: Baron Hans Heinrich (Heini) Thyssen-Bornemisza.

=== Thyssen-Bornemisza ownership (1975-1984) ===
Thyssen spent much of the next 8–10 years selling off or closing its North American investments. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the portions of Thyssen-Bornemisza which formed the Wayne Corporation went through a period of decline. By 1980, Wayne existed solely as a bus manufacturer in a segment itself struggling to survive.

In 1975, when the ownership of Wayne Corporation shifted from Indian Head to Thyssen, Wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the United States. Wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late 1970s, buoyed by sales of its Busette and Transette product lines. By 1980, the company was one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; school bus body manufacturing companies in the United States, competing with Blue Bird Body Company, Carpenter Body Works, Superior Coach Company, Thomas Built Buses, Inc., and Ward Body Works; the Big Six were joined by Crown Coach Corporation and Gillig Bros., manufacturers which traded primarily on the West Coast.

A downturn in North American school bus purchase volumes began in the late 1970s as the children of the Baby Boom completed their elementary and secondary educations. Bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity.

====Closure of professional car manufacturing====

The professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late 1970s. At the time, many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles, called &quot;combinations.&quot; Combinations disappeared from general service in the late 1970s. The downsizing of America&#x27;s biggest luxury cars, beginning with the 1977 model year, forced major changes upon professional car builders, who were dependent upon car frames purchased from General Motors and Ford Motor Company to begin their conversion processes.

Cotner-Bevington was closed in 1975, with Thyssen selling off its assets; Miller-Meteor was closed at the end of 1979.
;Downsizing
Alongside the rest of the full-size Cadillac product model line, the Cadillac commercial chassis was downsized for 1977 to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption. The Cadillac Division built 1,299 commercial chassis for 1977; of that total, only 21 Lifeliner Cadillac ambulances were manufactured by Wayne&#x27;s Miller-Meteor subsidiary.

For 1978, Cadillac&#x27;s commercial chassis production further declined to only 852 units; Miller-Meteor received orders for only 4 ambulances. There were no 1979 Miller-Meteor ambulances. On December 13, 1979, the company, with roots tracing back to 1853, closed its doors. The company laid-off 252 employees and terminated the contracts of their 34 North American distributors. By the late 1970s, as the situation became critical, Wayne Corporation, the parent of M-M and C-B, and Wayne&#x27;s Thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries. There were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business. In 1980, Cotner-Bevington ambulance product line was sold to Gene Knisley, owner of Mid-Continent Conversion Co., which was an ambulance and medicar builder in Kansas City, Missouri. The C-B plant in Blytheville, Arkansas was closed.

A few years later, the rights to the Miller-Meteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in Norwalk, Ohio which in 2004 was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on Cadillac and Lincoln chassis under the Miller-Meteor brand name.
;Regulatory Changes
At the same time coachbuilders met downsizing in the automotive industry, the federal government in the United States updated its requirements concerning minimum width, headroom, and equipment levels of emergency vehicles. These changes were part of the 1973 National EMS Systems Act, which was passed by Congress in 1974, and implemented four years later (in 1978). In order for communities to receive federal funds, their ambulances were required to meet updated federal specifications. Passenger-based vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last American-made automobile-based ambulance was built in 1978.

Three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today (as of 2017):

In the early 1970s, Wayne introduced a full line of non-car-based ambulances; the Type III Medi-cruiser was based on the popular Dodge B-series van Tradesman panel van, the Care-O-Van was a Type II ambulance and the Type I Guardian, an early version of a 1-ton truck-based modular ambulance.

====Rabbitransit: 41-MPG Taxi====
About the time of the 1979 energy crisis, Wayne&#x27;s Engineering Department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the diesel-powered Volkswagen Rabbit. The &quot;Rabbitransit&quot; vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers (8–12) with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles.

The mini-taxi project was dropped by Wayne. For potential liability reasons, the frequently seen &quot;Rabbitransit&quot; at the Richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed.

==== Sale by Thyssen ====
Although not publicly reported (as corporate ownership under Thyssen was private), it is likely that Wayne and Welles began incurring losses around 1980 or 1981, and these continued into 1982. By 1983, Wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at Wayne/Welles were reportedly in the millions, and the Thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage.

In 1984, following significant concessions by its unionized workers, members of United Auto Workers Local # 721 which were intended to make the company more efficient, Wayne Corporation (and its Canadian subsidiary, Welles, Ltd.) were sold by Thyssen to new owners.

=== Richmond Transportation Corporation (1985-1992) ===

In 1984, Richmond Transportation Corporation (RTC) was formed by Jack H. Dekruif, a Corona del Mar, California-based industrialist, and several officers who had served at Wayne for many years under the Indian Head and Thyssen ownership. RTC acquired Wayne Corporation and its Welles subsidiary in Canada in February, 1985. Terry G. Whitesell was named President of RTC. A civic leader in Richmond, Indiana, his prior responsibilities at Wayne included sales, marketing, and purchasing over a period of more than 15 years. Whitesell was well known within the company, its dealer and supplier networks, and the industry.

Although as industrialist investor, Dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses, he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete. Several successful years followed. The Chaperone and Chaperone II products on cutaway van chassis did well, and several Wayne dealer-contractors were expanding, most notably Laidlaw. In the fall of 1986, the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering (IPO) when &quot;Black Monday&quot; struck the stock market that October, forcing cancellation of the IPO.

====New-generation buses: Chaperone and Lifestar====

In 1985, Wayne introduced the Chaperone, a school bus designed to use a cutaway van chassis. Although the Busette had proven successful in the marketplace, its standard interior height of 63 inches was far shorter than a full-size school bus. In addition, the company sought to adapt the longitudinal-panel construction of the Wayne Lifeguard on a smaller bus. Using the same GM and Ford dual rear-wheel chassis as the Busette/Transette, the Chaperone fit the single-panel construction of the Lifeguard on its body, along with a standard bus-style door. The Busette would remain in production alongside the Chaperone through 1990, when Wayne sold its body tooling to Mid Bus.

For 1986, Wayne Corporation introduced the Wayne Lifestar, its first transit-style school bus since the early 1970s and its first transit-style bus with a front-engine layout since World War II. Designed specifically for school bus use, the body of the Lifestar was designed to share the longitudinal side panels of the Lifeguard. Unlike its largest competitors, Wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis in-house; consequently, chassis from an outside supplier was crucial. Supply problems outside of the company&#x27;s control led to the use of several suppliers for the Lifestar over its production run.

==== Bankruptcy ====
In the school bus marketplace, Wayne struggled alongside its competitors. In 1986, a major potential order for Wayne in Canada was split between Wayne and Ward. During 1987, its Welles factory in Canada was destroyed by fire; to keep the division in business, Wayne had to remodel a separate factory in Windsor; in June 1990, the Welles division was closed entirely.

Shortly after the introduction of the Wayne Lifestar, the Blue Bird TC/2000 was introduced; a model similar to the Lifestar, the TC/2000 captured a large share of the school bus segment. In 1991, Navistar, a chassis supplier for the Wayne Lifestar, purchased a controlling interest in AmTran; along with the end of Ward in school bus manufacturing, the purchase also began a period of mergers and acquisitions of school bus manufacturers by chassis suppliers.

Richmond Transportation Corporation (RTC) declared bankruptcy in August 1992, with the company put up for auction.

==Epilogue==

=== Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (1993-1995) ===
After the bankruptcy of Richmond Transportation Corporation, Wayne Corporation effectively ceased to exist. During its liquidation, the product rights and many of the assets of the company (aside from the company itself and its liabilities) were purchased in February 1993 by the BMY defense subsidiary of Harsco Corporation for $2.1 million. Seeking to diversify beyond military production, BMY relaunched the Wayne brand as Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (WWV) and relocated bus manufacturing to its Marysville, Ohio headquarters.

For the first time since 1875, Wayne no longer was associated with Richmond, Indiana; the Wayne Corporation factory was not included in the sale and remained shuttered. In Ohio, the Lifeguard and Lifestar full-size buses restarted production alongside the Chaperone small bus (the Busette ended production in 1990). The school buses restarted production largely unchanged, with the most notable revision being a change in chassis suppliers for the Lifestar. 

During 1994, Harsco began to change its footprint as a defense supplier; leading to BMY ending production of its 5-ton truck line. After an attempted sale of Wayne (to a commercial bus manufacturer) fell through, WWV was closed down by parent company Harsco in June 1995. Currently, this remains the final presence of the Wayne product line and brand name. 

At the time of its closure, Wayne was in the process of developing the RD-9000 school bus. A rear-engine design, the RD-9000 featured significant advances and innovations, improving usage for both driving and servicing the vehicle. The vehicle was only built as a prototype, with some features of the RD-9000 later adopted by competitive manufacturers. 

===Mid Bus===

In 1980, following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers, Superior Coach Company of Lima, Ohio was shut down by its parent company Sheller-Globe. The next year, Mid Bus was formed by three former Superior employees and seven co-workers, choosing to specialize in small school buses. Debuting a small bus named &quot;Superior by Mid Bus&quot; (a separate company produced full-size Superior school buses), the company converted a full-size van, adding a raised roof, reinforced body sides, and split-sash windows. In 1987, &quot;Superior&quot; was dropped as a prefix. 

By the end of the 1980s, Mid Bus sought to compete with larger-scale school bus manufacturers, seeking to replace its raised-roof van with a cutaway van chassis with a bus body. In 1990, Wayne discontinued production of the Busette in favor of the Chaperone, with the tooling for the body design sold to Mid Bus. The adoption of an existing design largely eliminated development and engineering costs, but through its production as a Wayne, the Busette had grown popular (especially among Head Start agencies), providing for an existing customer base. 

===Crown by Carpenter===
: &quot;See Also:&quot; Crown By Carpenter
Alongside Wayne, Indiana was home to school bus manufacturer Carpenter Body Works, a family-owned company from its 1919 founding until 1990. To modernize its product line, Carpenter purchased the tooling, intellectual, and product rights of California-based Crown Coach Corporation in May 1991. The company had sought to restart production of the Crown Supercoach Series II (introduced 1989), but the high cost of the vehicle and complexity of its design led Carpenter to shelve the idea (but retained all parts of the purchase). 

In 1994, Carpenter relocated from its Mitchell, Indiana, facilities to lease the former Wayne Corporation Richmond, Indiana facilities in their entirety. By moving to the Wayne facilities, Carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former Wayne Corporation employees. Both the leadership and workforce based at Richmond included a number of veterans of the former Wayne operations there; as such, they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort.

For 1996 production, Carpenter unveiled extensive changes to its body design. The body structure was strengthened with single-piece roof bows and full-length exterior lower guard rails; new welding procedures (allowed by the newer equipment at the Richmond factory) strengthened roof joints (without a crucial structural flaw later found in Mitchell-produced buses). The tooling from the Wayne factory also provided some components to update the body, with the Wayne Lifeguard donating its windshield, driver control panel, and entry door for the redesigned Carpenter body. 

Though retaining its official corporate name, Carpenter considered the transformation of its bus line so extensive that it changed its branding to &quot;Crown by Carpenter&quot;. Resurrecting the first half of the Crown Coach name, the company introduced a revised version of a Crown Coach emblem introduced in the late 1980s. In an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses, the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its Cadet bus products.

Facing a similar market situation as Wayne did at the beginning of the decade, Carpenter continued to struggle for market share through the end of the 1990s, leading to its closure. In 1998, the company was acquired by Michigan-based Spartan Motors, one of its largest chassis suppliers. In a similar situation, AmTran and Thomas Built Buses were acquired by Navistar and Freightliner, respectively. At the end of the 1990s, lower initial capital costs for school buses began to trump their longevity; when it was time for purchasing decisions, financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with shorter life cycles. 

After 1999, Carpenter retired the Crown name and its small bus lines. In another redesign of the body, Carpenter kept the Wayne Lifeguard entry door; while the windshield was redesigned, the dashboard of the Lifeguard was adopted nearly in its entirety. In early 2001, majority owner Spartan Motors (holding a ⅔ stake) did not see any potential return on any further investments made on the company, voting to end the venture.

===Fate of the factory===

The former Wayne Corporation plant, after standing idle for a number of years, was purchased by a group of investors in 2005 with the intention of using the plant and surrounding property for a business park. The investors intended to use the large plant to house a number of smaller companies, rather than looking for a single, large corporation. At the end of 2006, the property along Interstate 70 was becoming re-utilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises. Included was construction of new retail businesses such as restaurants and service stations near the busy Interstate highway exit which had been known for over 25 years for the massive bus factory and acres of yellow school buses and chassis of Wayne Corporation.

<text>Judith Miller (; 3 July 1941 – 6 December 2017) was a French psychoanalyst, born in Antibes. She was the daughter of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and Sylvia Bataille. Her spouse was Lacanian Jacques-Alain Miller.

==Work==
As a Maoist philosophy lecturer at Vincennes in Paris, Miller&#x27;s radicalism was used as a reason for her philosophy department to be decertified. This occurred after she handed out course credit to someone she met on a bus, and subsequently publicly declared in a radio interview that the university is a capitalist institution, and that she would do everything she could to make it run as badly as possible. After this, she was demoted by the French education department to a lycée teacher.

==Death==
Judith Miller died on 6 December 2017 in Paris, aged 76.

<doc id="1157097" wikidata="Q466544" url="?curid=1157097" title="Loggia">
<text>In architecture, a loggia ( , , ) is a covered exterior gallery or corridor, often on an upper level, sometimes on the ground level of a building. The corridor is open to the elements because its outer wall is only partial, with the upper part usually supported by a series of columns or arches. An overhanging loggia may be supported by a baldresca.

From the early Middle Ages, nearly every Italian comune had an open arched loggia in its main square, which served as a &quot;symbol of communal justice and government and as a stage for civic ceremony&quot;.

In Italian architecture, a loggia is also a small garden structure or house built on the roof of a residence, open on one or more sides, to enjoy cooling winds and the view. They were especially popular in the 17th century and are prominent in Rome and Bologna, Italy.

== Definition of the Roman loggia ==
The main difference between a loggia and a portico is the role within the functional layout of the building. The portico allows entrance to the inside from the exterior and can be found on vernacular and small scale buildings. Thus, it is found mainly on noble residences and public buildings. A classic use of both is that represented in the mosaics of Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo of the Royal Palace.

Loggias differ from verandas in that they are more architectural and, in form, are part of the main edifice in which they are located, while verandas are roofed structures attached on the outside of the main building. A &quot;double loggia&quot; occurs when a loggia is located on an upper floor level above a loggia on the floor beneath.

== Examples ==
* Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, contains three distinct sets of dorms connected by loggias. The main quad on the Stanford University campus in Stanford, California, prominently features loggias, as do the University Center and Purnell Center for the Arts at Carnegie Mellon University, which frame a quad known as the Cut.
* In the city centre of Chester in England, a number of timber-framed buildings dating from the medieval to Victorian periods have first-floor loggias called the Chester Rows.
* In Russia and Switzerland, a &quot;&quot; can be a form of recessed balcony on a residential apartment building.
* A loggia was added to the Sydney Opera House in 2006.
* At the archeological site of Hagia Triada on the Greek island of Crete, several loggias constructed around 1400 BC have been located and whose column bases still remain.

<doc id="1157102" wikidata="Q11723142" url="?curid=1157102" title="Balise">
<text>A balise ( ) is an electronic beacon or transponder placed between the rails of a railway as part of an automatic train protection (ATP) system. The French word &quot;&quot; is used to distinguish these beacons from other kinds of beacons.

Balises are used in the KVB signalling system installed on main lines of the French railway network, other than the high-speed Lignes à Grande Vitesse.

Balises constitute an integral part of the European Train Control System, where they serve as &quot;beacons&quot; giving the exact location of a train. The ETCS signalling system is gradually being introduced on railways throughout the European Union.

Balises are also used in the Chinese Train Control System versions CTCS-2 and CTCS-3 installed on high-speed rail lines in China, which is based on the European Train Control System.

A balise which complies with the European Train Control System specification is called a Eurobalise.

== Overview ==
A balise typically needs no power source. In response to radio frequency energy broadcast by a Balise Transmission Module mounted under a passing train, the balise either transmits information to the train (&quot;uplink&quot;) or receives information from the train (&quot;downlink&quot;, although this function is rarely used). The transmission rate of Eurobalises is sufficient for a complete &#x27;telegram&#x27; to be received by a train passing at any speed up to 500 km/h.

A balise may be either a &#x27;Fixed Data Balise&#x27;, or &#x27;Fixed Balise&#x27; for short, transmitting the same data to every train, or a &#x27;Transparent Data Balise&#x27; which transmits variable data, also called a &#x27;Switchable&#x27; or &#x27;Controllable Balise&#x27;. (Note that the word &#x27;fixed&#x27; refers to the information transmitted by the balise, not to its physical location. All balises are immobile).

A fixed balise is programmed to transmit the same data to every train. Information transmitted by a fixed balise typically includes: the location of the balise; the geometry of the line, such as curves and gradients; and any speed restrictions. The programming is performed using a wireless programming device. Thus a fixed balise can notify a train of its exact location, and the distance to the next signal, and can warn of any speed restrictions.

A controllable balise is connected to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as signal indications. Balises forming part of an ETCS Level 1 signalling system employ this capability. The LEU integrates with the conventional (national) signal system either by connecting to the lineside railway signal or to the signalling control tower.

Balises must be deployed in pairs so that the train can distinguish the direction of travel 1→2 from direction 2→1, unless they are linked to a previous balise group in which case they can contain only one balise. Extra balises can be installed if the volume of data is too great.

Balises operate with equipment on the train to provide a system that enhances the safety of train operation: at the approaches to stations with multiple platforms fixed balises may be deployed, as a more accurate supplement to GPS, to enable safe operation of automatic selective door opening.

== Installation ==
The balise is typically mounted on or between sleepers or ties in the centre line of the track. 
A train travelling at maximum speed of will transmit and receive a minimum of three copies of the telegram while passing over each Eurobalise. The earlier KER balises (KVB, EBICAB, RSDD) were specified to work up to .

The train&#x27;s on-board computer uses the data from the balises to determine the safe speed profile for the line ahead. Enough information is needed to allow the train to come to a safe standstill if required.

The data in the balise can include the distance to the next balise. This is used to check for missing balises which could otherwise lead to a potential wrong-side failure.

At the start and end of ATP-equipped territory, a pair of fixed balises are often used to inform the onboard ATP equipment to start or stop supervision of the train movements.

== Usage ==
Eurobalises are used in:
* ETCS – the European-wide train protection system
* Chinese Train Control System versions CTCS-2 and CTCS-3, used on high speed rail lines in China
* EuroSignum – a variant of the earlier Swiss Integra-Signum train protection system
* EuroZub – a variant of the earlier Swiss ZUB 121 train protection system
* SCMT – an Italian train protection system
* TBL1+ – a train protection system used in Belgium
* GNT – the system to control tilting trains in Germany
* ZBS – a new rapid transit control system for the S-Bahn Berlin
* TASS – a system to control the tilting of trains on the West Coast Main Line

Balises other than Eurobalises are used in:
* KVB – a train protection system used in France
* ASFA – a train protection system used in Spain
* ACSES – a train protection system used by Amtrak on the Northeast Corridor in the USA
* ATACS – a moving block train protection system used in some parts of Japan
* Automatic train control (ATC), Automatic train protection (ATP), Automatic train stop (ATS) and Communications-based train control (CBTC) in many parts of the world
* EBICAB – a train protection system used in Norway, Sweden, Finland and some other countries, including parts of Spain
* TASC – an automatic train braking and protection system used on some Japanese railway lines
* C-APT – &quot;(historical)&quot; a system once developed for the APT to transmit permissible speed and airtightness information

== History ==
The earliest automatic train protection system were purely mechanical with a tripcock which could be connected directly to the braking system by releasing the opening a switch in the hydraulic system. There were multiple incidents where trains had overrun a stop signal but due to excessive speed still crashed despite the automatic stop. Multiple systems were invented to show the speed in the driver&#x27;s cab and to provide an electronic system on the train that would prevent speeding. With the advent of high-speed trains it was generally expected that a speed indicator on line-side signals is not sufficient beyond so that all these trains need cab signalling.

A combined solution to the requirements was the German LZB system that was presented in 1965. The original installations were all hard-wired logic. The first real cab electronics was presented in 1972 (named LZB L72) and a cab computer was introduced by 1980 (LZB 80). The LZB system uses a wire in the middle of the tracks that had loops at a distance of so that the position of a train was known more precisely than in any earlier system. As a result, the LZB system was not only used on high-speed tracks but also in commuter rail to increase throughput. Due to the deployment costs of the system however it was restricted to these application areas.

During the 1970s British Rail developed the C-APT, the system utilised passive transponders (balises) placed at no more than 1km track intervals, that would transmit the track speed (in an 80bit packet) to a passing train, for in cab display. If the trains control system failed to receive an update, within 1km of the last signal, the displayed speed limit would be blanked an audio tone the driver had to respond to generated, else the trains brakes were automatically applied, the system would be see revenue service from December 1981, with the introduction of the British Rail Class 370.

The development of a system using the principle of passive balises with fixed or controlled information started in 1975 by LMEricson and SRT, following an incident in Norway in 1975 (Tretten). The LME/SRT system became the Ebicab system. The Ebicab system established the principles of using magnetic coupling, 27 MHz downlink from the antenna on the locomotive to energize the balises, and an uplink using 4,5 MHz to transmit information telegrams from the balises. The controlled information in the balises is encoded from statuses in the signalling system. The telegrams contains information about permitted speeds, and distances. The information is used in the on-board computer to calculate brake curves, monitor speed and eventually apply brakes. In Norway, the first line equipped with Ebicab as ATP was operational in 1983. The Ebicab principles are subsequently used in KVB and RSDD systems and also for the ERTMS ETCS balises. During the 1980s, other cab computers were introduced to read the older signalling and to overlay it with better control. The German PZ80 was able to check the speed in steps of . The French KVB replaced the external system with balises in the early 1990s to transmit a combined information for oncoming signal aspects and the allowed train speed. Siemens did also invent a successor to the PZB signalling that was deployed as in Switzerland since 1992 and in Denmark since 1992. ABB improved the external balises in the EBICAB 900 system which as then adopted in Spain and Italy.

Siemens had presented a study on balise systems in 1992 which influenced the choice of using a technology based on KVB and GSM instead of LZB when the European Rail Traffic Management System was researching a possible train signalling for Europe. The first Eurobalises were tested in 1996 and later train protection systems used them as a basis for their signalling needs.

<text>Pehr (Per) Georg Scheutz (23 September 1785 – 22 May 1873) was a Swedish lawyer, translator, and inventor, who is now best known for his pioneering work in computer technology.

==Life==
Scheutz studied law at Lund University, graduating in 1805. He then worked as a legal expert and translator (he translated several works of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott) before turning predominantly to liberal politics and mechanical engineering.

He is most known for his inventions; the best known of these is the Scheutzian calculation engine, invented in 1837 and finalized in 1843. This machine, which he constructed with his son Edvard Scheutz, was based on Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine. In 1851 they obtained funds from government to build an improved model, which was created in 1853 (was roughly the size of a piano), and subsequently demonstrated at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, 1855. The machine was then sold in 1856 to the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York. In 1857 British government ordered another model, which was built by Donkin&#x27;s company in 1859.

The devices were used for creating logarithmic tables.

While the machine was not perfect and could not produce complete tables, Martin Wiberg reworked the construction from the ground up and in 1875 created a compact device which would print complete tables.

Scheutz was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1856.

<text>USS &quot;Halfbeak&quot; (SS-352), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the halfbeak.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Halfbeak&quot; was launched 19 February 1946 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, sponsored by Mrs. William Craig, and commissioned on 22 July 1946.

==Service history==
After shakedown in the Caribbean and along the Latin American coast to the Canal Zone, Ecuador, and Colombia, &quot;Halfbeak&quot; spent the next 3 years in training operations and fleet exercises out of New London, Conn., where she was part of SubRon 8. Entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard 12 September 1949, &quot;Halfbeak&quot; was converted to a GUPPY II type submarine. Fitted with a snorkel to enable her to stay submerged for long periods of time and distinguished by a greatly streamlined superstructure, &quot;Halfbeak&quot; left Portsmouth 13 January 1950 to work with the Research and Development Group at New London. While conducting tests on special underwater sound equipment, she made a cruise to English waters, operating off Jan Mayen Island, in the winter of 1951.

&quot;Halfbeak&quot; was engaged in further Caribbean exercises until 10 November 1954, when she sailed for her first Mediterranean cruise. Having visited Gibraltar, Naples, Marseilles, Lisbon, and Valencia, Spain, the submarine returned to New London 2 February 1955. A similar cruise in 1956 was punctuated by the Suez Crisis, and &quot;Halfbeak&quot; remained in the eastern Med operating with the 6th Fleet until January 1957 helping to maintain the peace in that crucial region.

Her duties took another turn as 28 July 1958 she departed for the Arctic, where with the nuclear submarine she operated under and around the polar ice pack to gather information in connection with the International Geophysical Year. During these operations, &quot;Skate&quot; sailed under the Arctic ice pack to reach the North Pole 11 August and continued to cruise freely there repeating the visit 6 days later.

Local operations and exercises, primarily submarine and fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean but also NATO maneuvers, occupied &quot;Halfbeak&quot; until 1963, when she resumed her role testing and evaluating sonar and other underwater sound equipment out of New London.

James Bamford in Body of Secrets claims that around September 1965, &quot;Halfbeak&quot; conducted for the NSA a classified SIGINT mission off the Kola Peninsula . She was detected by Soviet forces, and had to hide for many hours below its maximum permissible depth before escaping. These events were omitted from the official ship&#x27;s history.

&quot;Halfbeak&quot; was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for 1966 and 1967 and held the &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Division 102 for 1968. &quot;Halfbeak&quot; was decommissioned and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register, 1 July 1971. She was sold for scrapping, 13 July 1972.

<text>W^X (&quot;write xor execute&quot;, pronounced &quot;W xor X&quot;) is a security feature in operating systems and virtual machines. It is a memory protection policy whereby every page in a process&#x27;s or kernel&#x27;s address space may be either writable or executable, but not both. Without such protection, a program can write (as data &quot;W&quot;) CPU instructions in an area of memory intended for data and then run (as executable &quot;X&quot;; or read-execute &quot;RX&quot;) those instructions. This can be dangerous if the writer of the memory is malicious. W^X is the Unix-like terminology for a strict use of the general concept of executable space protection, controlled via the system call.

W^X is relatively simple on processor architectures that support fine-grained page permissions, such as Sun&#x27;s SPARC and SPARC64, AMD&#x27;s x86-64, Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PA-RISC, HP&#x27;s (originally Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s) Alpha, and ARM.

The term W^X has also been applied to file system write/execute permissions to mitigate file write vulnerabilities (as with in memory) and attacker persistence. Enforcing restrictions on file permissions can also close gaps in W^X enforcement caused by memory mapped files. Outright forbidding the usage of arbitrary native code can also mitigate kernel and CPU vulnerabilities not exposed via the existing code on the computer. A less intrusive approach is to lock a file for the duration of any mapping into executable memory, which suffices to prevent post-inspection bypasses.

== Compatibility ==

Some early Intel 64 processors lacked the NX bit required for W^X, but this appeared in later chips. On more limited processors such as the Intel i386, W^X requires using the CS code segment limit as a &quot;line in the sand&quot;, a point in the address space above which execution is not permitted and data is located, and below which it is allowed and executable pages are placed. This scheme was used in Exec Shield.

Linker changes are generally required to separate data from code (such as trampolines that are needed for linker and library runtime functions). The switch allowing mixing is usually called codice_1 on Unix-like systems

W^X can also pose a minor problem for just-in-time compilation, which involves an interpreter generating machine code on the fly and then running it. The simple solution used by most, historically including Firefox, involves just making the page executable after the interpreter is done writing machine code, using on Windows or on Unix-like operating systems. The other solution involves mapping the same region of memory to two pages, one with RW and the other with RX. There is no simple consensus on which solution is safer: supporters of the latter approach believe allowing a page that has ever been writable to be executed defeats the point of W^X (there exists an SELinux policy to control such operations called ) and that address space layout randomization would make it safe to put both pages in the same process. Supporters of the former approach believe that the latter approach is only safe when the two pages are given to two separate processes, and inter-process communication would be costlier than calling .

== History ==

W^X was first implemented in OpenBSD 3.3, released May 2003. In 2004, Microsoft introduced a similar feature called DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows XP. Similar features are available for other operating systems, including the PaX and Exec Shield patches for Linux, and NetBSD&#x27;s implementation of PaX. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and automatically CentOS) version 5, or by Linux Kernel 2.6.18-8, SELinux received the , , and policies that provide W^X when disabled.

Although W^X (or DEP) has only protected userland programs for most of its existence, in 2012 Microsoft extended it to the Windows kernel on the x86 and ARM architectures. In late 2014 and early 2015, W^X was added in the OpenBSD kernel on the AMD64 architecture. In early 2016, W^X was fully implemented on NetBSD&#x27;s AMD64 kernel and partially on the i386 kernel.

macOS computers running on Apple silicon processors enforce W^X for all programs. Intel-based Macs enforce the policy only for programs that use the OS&#x27;s Hardened Runtime mode.

Starting with Firefox 46 in 2016 and ending with Firefox 116 in 2023, Firefox&#x27;s virtual machine for JavaScript implemented the W^X policy. This was later rolled back on some platforms for performance reasons, though remained in others which enforce W^X for all programs.

Starting with .NET 6.0 in 2021, .NET now uses W^X.

<text>is a city located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 55,354 with 20,047 households, and a population density of 96.1 persons per km2. Its total area was .

==Geography==

Minamiuonuma is situated in a valley in a mountainous region of Niigata Prefecture, located on Honshu, Japan&#x27;s largest and most centralised island. Dotted with ski lodges and other winter activity facilities, the city is in a region known as &quot;Snow Country&quot;; indeed, Minamiuonuma sits at an average elevation of around 617 m (2,024 ft) above sea level, creating a wintry climate in the coldest months of the year. The city sits just between Mount Sakado to the southeast, which measures 634 m (2,080 ft) tall, and Masugata Yama, measuring some 747 m (2,450 ft) above sea level, to the northwest. The highest peaks in the area reach well over 1600 m (5,249 ft), and some measure as high as 2000 m (approx. 6,700 ft).

Parts of the city are within the borders of the Jōshin&#x27;etsu-kōgen National Park; to the north, the city is bounded by Uonuma and the Echigo Sanzan-Tadami Quasi-National Park (and its associated mountains), and to the south by Yuzawa, a popular ski resort town. The Uono River flows through most of the city. The city and its surrounding areas are dotted with many onsen (hot springs) and ski resorts, making it a popular destination in winter. There are also a large number of seasonal paddy fields, as this is part of the major &quot;koshihikari&quot; rice-growing region in Japan. Other popular seasonal produce is grown, as well, like watermelon.

The average annual temperature in the region is 11.3 °C (52.3 °F); temperatures are highest, on average, in August, at around 24.3 °C (75.7 °F), and lowest in January, at around -1.1 °C (30 °F).

==Demographics==
According to Japanese census data, the population of Minamiuonuma peaked around 1950 and has since declined to about the same level as a century ago.

==History==
The area of present-day Minamiuonuma was part of the ancient Echigo Province. The village of Muikamachi was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and was elevated to &quot;town&quot; status on July 13, 1900. The city of Minamiuonuma was established on November 1, 2004, from the merger of Muikamachi with the neighbouring town of Yamato (both from Minamiuonuma District). On October 1, 2005, the town of Shiozawa (from Minamiuonuma District) was also merged into Minamiuonuma.

==Government==

Minamiuonuma has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 22 members. Minamiuonuma, together with the town of Yuzawa, contributes two members to the Niigata Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Niigata 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==

The economy of Minamiuonuma is based primarily on agriculture and seasonal tourism.

==Education==
Minamiuonuma has 17 public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government.

<doc id="1157115" wikidata="Q14875408" url="?curid=1157115" title="Rochdale College">
<text>Rochdale College was an experiment in student-run alternative education and co-operative living in Toronto, Canada from 1968 to 1975. It provided space for 840 residents in a co-operative living space. It was also an informal, noncredited free university where students and teachers would live together and share knowledge. The project ultimately failed when it could not cover its financing and neighbours complained that it had become a haven for drugs and crime.

== Co-operative housing experiment ==
Rochdale was the largest co-op residence in North America, occupying an 18-storey student residence at Bloor St. and Huron St. in downtown Toronto. It was situated on the edges of the University of Toronto campus, near to Yorkville, Toronto&#x27;s hippie haven in the 1960s and early 1970s.

The college took its name from Rochdale, a town in north-west England, where the world&#x27;s first cooperative society was established in 1844. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers is usually considered the first successful co-operative enterprise, used as a model for modern co-ops, following the &#x27;Rochdale Principles&#x27;. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over 1,000 co-operative societies in the United Kingdom.

The college&#x27;s modern architecture was uniquely designed for communal living. Some areas were divided into independently operated communal units of about a dozen bedrooms (called &quot;ashrams&quot;), each with its own collective washroom, kitchen and dining room. Each unit was responsible for collecting rent and maintaining its own housekeeping. Other areas consisted of bachelor, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments. On the first and second floor were common areas used for socialization, education, and commercial purposes. The roof was accessible from the 18th floor and was used for sunbathing. Clothing was optional.

== Founding ==

Rochdale began as a response to a growing need for student housing at the University of Toronto, and a nineteen-year-old entrepreneur and philosophy student, Howard Adelman, was hired by the Campus Co-operative to meet the housing demand in 1958. With Adelman&#x27;s advice, Campus Co-op began to acquire more properties, and formed Campus Co-operative Residence Incorporated., a non-profit offshoot of Campus Co-op. After obtaining federal mortgages at well below the market rate, Campus Co-op incorporated Rochdale College in 1964.

It was by accident rather than design that Rochdale became such a tall building. Campus Co-op preferred to have the building be built to two times coverage, which would have resulted in a relatively easily managed building whose floor area would be only twice the size of the lot. However, due to Rochdale&#x27;s location on a busy arterial road, the site was zoned at seven times coverage. This meant an unanticipated jump to 840 residents, a fact that was originally greeted with great enthusiasm, due to the expansionist attitudes of the founders. Zoning regulations also stipulated that the site was to be an apartment-hotel, which meant that only half the floor space could be used for apartments with self-contained kitchens. This disadvantage was not fully appreciated due to faith in a communal system, in which residents would be expected to effectively share the space available to them.

In addition, the west and east wings differed by planners’ fiat in matters of self-containment and density of intended occupation. The west wing attracted a population that was relatively stable, an attraction helped by one-year leases, while the east wing attracted more transient tenants. The west-wing units were more in demand, not surprisingly when the rent structure in the first years gave an Aphrodite for two at $135 a month in the west wing and a Gnostic for two, with less space, at $200 a month in the east. With this rent structure, for some time the east wing subsidized the “landed gentry” in the west. The west wing with its self-contained units [the apartments] tended to stay aloof from the east wing [the hotel], and east-wing residents often were uninterested in the operations of the College. In a symbolic rather than a practical sense, a visible seal was put on this east-west division by a fire door that split the floors in half.

Campus Co-op, the parent corporation of Rochdale College, was uncomfortable with education taking a central role at Rochdale, a position held strongly by Rochdale&#x27;s intellectual leaders such as Dennis Lee. A decision was made to separate from Campus Co-op. Further emphasis was placed on education when Adelman noted that the college&#x27;s $175,000 property tax could be avoided if they had a functioning educational program. In Adelman&#x27;s words, if &quot;we run an education program for $75,000, we&#x27;ll come out $100,000 ahead.&quot;

Although many Rochdale founders viewed its education program as a form of tax avoidance, those who were dedicated to Rochdale as an educational institution did not let that deter them from pursuing what they viewed as a more noble purpose. Dennis Lee, the creative talent of the operation, notes plans like the tax avoidance scheme were, &quot;primarily in the thinking of people like Howard who were involved in the planning, they did a good job of keeping their cards fairly close to their chest. It was not something that was being passed around generally, [...] it would have made other people completely furious to hear it at the time.&quot; Yet it would be inaccurate to conclude that Adelman, the organizational talent of the operation, did not share its educational goals. With Lee, Adelman edited a collection of articles published in 1968 that constituted a manifesto of sorts for &quot;free university&quot; education, calling for liberation from inhibiting educational institutions. Adelman&#x27;s contribution was a particularly scathing indictment of the modern university as an institution that stifles innovation and serves only the establishment.

Even before its construction, there was a tension in Rochdale between fiscal responsibility and idealism. Mietkiewicz writes, &quot;[p]erhaps because of their idealistic preoccupations, few of Rochdale&#x27;s academic leaders were fully aware that much of Campus Co-op&#x27;s enthusiasm for education had stemmed from its vision of the program as a sort of tax dodge.&quot;

== Transition ==

The originally intended tenants for Rochdale were screened. Screenings were handled by residents of the Rochdale Houses, a precursor &quot;dry-run&quot; to Rochdale conducted at Campus Co-op owned houses, and they chose people who were by and large going to be associated with the University of Toronto. However, a construction strike in 1967 that delayed the opening of Rochdale by half a year changed Rochdale&#x27;s population from what was supposed to be a carefully selected one to a completely random one. The screened applicants, most of whom had commitments to the university, could not wait for Rochdale to be completed and many found new accommodations. The simple fact that the building was still in some ways a construction site may have deterred many of the students who were attracted to the idea of the hip, alternative education envisioned by its founders, torpedoing the raison d’être for the enterprise on day one. In contrast, Toronto’s hippies were undeterred by the dust and debris. Following the month-long hepatitis scare that had swept through their nearby Yorkville scene and looking towards the long winter to come, they weren’t exactly picky. They poured into this apparent haven by the hundreds.

When the college was slowly completed floor by floor, a practical decision was made to make the building available to &quot;people who walked in right off the street.&quot; As the small group of founders later stated: &quot;[w]e were sealing the fate of the Rochdale that most of us had wanted to experiment with. And since there were very few rules about how the place would be run, we were in effect handing the building over to people very unlike ourselves.&quot; &quot;If the new residents were a problem to the resource people, non-residents were a problem to everyone,&quot; says Rochdale chronicler and Ohio University Lecturer David Sharpe. &quot;As Rochdalians claimed floor by floor in the fall of 1968, transients discovered wide open areas on the upper floors and moved in – and out and in and out. As those areas became permanently occupied, the transients continued to wander and squat and wander again. Meanwhile, word of mouth, word of press, called out: A free college! A college so unlicensed that it offers, not freedom or license, but both. Freedom from parents, freedom from rent, freedom even from an address. Thousands of visitors and interim residents came from the roads and the suburbs.

&quot;Metro had a little school&lt;br&gt;
Its name was black as sin&lt;br&gt;
And day and night the Metro kids&lt;br&gt;
Were screaming to get in.&quot; (&quot;Rochdale Daily&quot;)

== Educational ideals ==

In the late 1960s, universities were centres of political idealism and experimentation. Rochdale College was established as an alternative to what were considered traditional paternalistic and non-democratic governing bodies within university education. Conversely, Rochdale&#x27;s government policy was decided at open meetings in which all members of the co-operative could attend, participate in debate, and engage in consensus decision making.

It was the largest of more than 300 tuition-free universities in North America, and offered no structured courses, curriculum, exams, degrees, or traditional teaching faculty. From humble beginnings in seminars on phenomenology and a Recorder Consort that performed with the London (Ontario) Symphony Orchestra, it became a hot bed of freethought and radical idealism.

Rochdale College never used traditional professors or structured classes. Posting notices on bulletin boards and in a student newsletter, groups of students coalesced around an interest, and &quot;resource people&quot; were found with various academic and non-academic backgrounds, who led informal discussion groups on a wide variety of subjects. Resource persons of note included an Anglican priest, Alderman and later Member of Parliament, Dan Heap, author Dennis Lee and Futurian Judith Merril, who founded Rochdale&#x27;s library.

Rochdale participants were involved with various cultural institutions in Toronto such as Coach House Press, Theatre Passe Muraille, The Toronto Free Dance Theatre, &quot;This Magazine is About Schools&quot; (now &quot;This Magazine&quot;), the Spaced-out Library (now the Merril Collection of the Toronto Public Library) and House of Anansi Press. Rochdale&#x27;s co-op daycare Acorn (which was relocated from the Rochdale site to the basement of nearby St. Thomas Church) lives on today as Huron Playschool Cooperative.

Students had complete freedom to develop their own learning process, much of which emerged from the shared community experience. The college included theatres for drama and film, and a ceramics studio. Students decided school policy and made their own evaluations.

It was typical of the free universities not to award degrees and the University of Toronto did not offer degrees through Rochdale College. Indicative of the playful humour of the times, anyone could purchase a BA by donating $25 to the college and answering a simple skill-testing question. An MA cost $50, with the applicant choosing the question. A PhD cost $100, no questions asked.

The Rochdale application also described its &quot;non-degree&quot;: &quot;We are also offering Non-Degrees at comparable rates. A Non-BA is $25.00. Course duration is your choice; requirements are simple, we ask that you say something. A Non-MA is $50.00 for which we require you to say something logical. A Non-PhD is $100.00; you will be required to say something useful.&quot; Nobody at Rochdale ever took these degrees seriously, and the fees (if any were collected) were treated as voluntary donations.

&quot;1970–73 is the period that has always interested observers of the College most,&quot; Henderson writes, &quot;[filled with] sustained attempts at building the truly functional alternative social structures, communities, and facilities that characterized the period. Residents, realizing that they were edging towards a kind of separate society right there in the building, founded a health clinic (where babies were born!), a library, a range of food services, a child care centre, an in-house radio and TV station, a vibrant newspaper, and a series of floor-wide communes.&quot; Its own pirate radio station was called CRUD, with an unusual assortment of music, talk, and static. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission tried to shut the station down a number of times, but the dedication of its staff kept it on the air. Rochdale had a large cafeteria and a ground-floor restaurant open to the public. It had a health-food store, a laundromat on the roof, a day-care, a free school called Superschool where the kids designed their own curriculum, and a medical clinic run by an RN. &quot;It is often claimed,&quot; says Henderson, &quot;that some inhabitants didn’t go outside for weeks and months at a stretch, since they could access everything they needed right within the building.&quot;

== Drug culture ==

Rochdale was originally a refuge for idealists. Ultimately, the constituents of its cooperative idealism were its downfall. Dedicated to consensus decision making and granting a vote to everyone who lived (or claimed to live) in the building, Rochdale&#x27;s governing body was unable to reach agreement to expel those who failed to pay their rents or otherwise live up to its ideals. Unable to pay its mortgage to the Canadian government, Rochdale drifted towards insolvency. As nearby Yorkville became gentrified during the late 1960s, much of Toronto&#x27;s counterculture moved into Rochdale. This included homeless squatters and bikers who dealt hard drugs, along with a substantial number of undercover officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Judith Merril, librarian at Rochdale during the early 1970s, reported that Robert MacDonald, an employee of the Addiction Research Foundation, maintained a presence at Rochdale and actively collected samples of the available drugs, which were lab tested for toxicity and the results made available to Rochdale residents.

According to the CBC Archives, by 1971 Rochdale had become known as &quot;&#x27;North America&#x27;s largest drug distribution warehouse.&#x27; Hash, pot, and LSD are in large supply. The Rochdale security force includes members of biker gangs&quot; Hiring the bikers for security in late 1971 was the beginning of the end. Until then there was a strict unwritten code that no one sold hard drugs out of Rochdale.

CBC Archives also describe how &quot;[d]ue to problems with cops and bikers, the governing council set up a paid security force to be on 24-hour alert. Ironically, some of these security people were bikers themselves. As had happened in Yorkville, an unofficial alliance with the Vagabonds outlaw motorcycle club developed.&quot; Rochdale&#x27;s educational focus and student population declined as the drug business increased.

After increased clashes with police, and unable to pay its mortgage, political pressure forced financial foreclosure by the government, and Rochdale closed in 1975. A number of residents refused to leave. On 30 May the last residents were carried from the building by police. The doors to the college had to be welded shut to keep them out. &quot;When it was clear that the game was up,&quot; writes Sharpe, &quot;Rochdale published its own wry comment: &#x27;Drugdealing is now the domain of the professionals, i.e. lawyers, doctors, etc. Let&#x27;s hope they never get to live in the same building.&#x27;&quot;

== The building ==

The 18-storey tower that once housed Rochdale at 341 Bloor Street is now known as the Senator David A. Croll Apartments. Completed in 1968, it is the sister building to the Tartu student residence a short distance west across Bloor street. Designed by the architects Elmar Tampõld and John Wells (who had earlier constructed the Charles Street Apartments at Bay Street and Bloor Street).

== In retrospect ==
&quot;Love it or loathe it, Rochdale College is hard to dismiss even 20 years after its closing.&quot; (&quot;University of Toronto Magazine&quot;, Spring, 1995, p. 38.)

&quot;At its best,&quot; Sharpe writes, &quot;Rochdale was a noble experiment. It tested new approaches to education, creativity, and community, and like the testing of new products in industry, the limits of a new product cannot be known until the point of destruction is reached. This product of the Sixties -- the mix of ideals and attitudes that Rochdale concentrated from the surrounding youth culture -- had to be dropped from a height, pounded, stretched, and put under heat. The accomplishment of Rochdale cannot be separated from its eventual destruction, and an institution that was not allowed to be self-destructive about such sweeping questions would have tested nothing at all.&quot;

Judith Merril writes, comparing University of Toronto&#x27;s nearby Ontario Institute for Studies in Education with Rochdale: &quot;At OISE, as at Rochdale, ninety-nine starts out of a hundred are false ones. At OISE, of course, they have to keep records of all that money, so they know what they&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t work, and maybe why, and maybe what to try next. At Rochdale, they have to keep trying the same inexpensive things over and over, because they have no money and no records -- and sometimes something works after a while. Which way is worse?&quot;

The story of Rochdale was turned into a play by Canadian playwright, David Yee, and was staged during the Summerworks theatre festival in 2022.

<doc id="1157118" wikidata="Q7729976" url="?curid=1157118" title="The Devil Made Me Do It">
<text>The Devil Made Me Do It is the debut studio album by American rapper Paris. It was released on October 9, 1990, on Tommy Boy Records. Paris toured the US and Europe that year to promote the record. The album eventually sold over 300,000 copies according to the emcee.

==Release==
The title track was banned on MTV. Some record stores refused to carry a version of the album, due to a cover image of a police officer putting a Black boy in a chokehold.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Menacing...the vocals intensify and get hyper, creating a heightened sense of anxiety...his lyrics are intense and he drops science while showing skills on the mic...&quot;
- &quot;The Source&quot;

&quot;Rap music reaches new heights of political invective on Paris&#x27; jolting debut recording...Paris boosts his message with unique, sleek music...adding a primal beast-on-the-hunt quality...&quot;
- &quot;People&quot;

&quot;Hard-hitting beats combined with razor-sharp lyrics...Listen to the rhymes flow, and you&#x27;ll realize that Paris is a massive, militant talent...&quot;
- &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot;

&quot;Paris motivates with an authoritative voice that speaks to the underground rather than trying to pacify the masses.&quot;
- &quot;CMJ&quot;

&quot;Easily the outstanding rap debut of 1990...a case study in how it should be done...this album profoundly understands the musical strategies of dissonance, atmosphere, space...Paris possesses one of those menacing voices that draws you into its husky world, via a timbre that carries the meaning within itself. In rap, the message is in the medium, and the medium is in the grain of the voice.&quot;
- &quot;Express&quot;

&quot;More than just a rap album - it&#x27;s a revolutionary handbook. Music for those who want mental stimulation with their dope beats.&quot;
- &quot;Urb&quot;

&quot;An impressive debut with street smart, political, well-done raps...a strong, strong record.&quot;
- &quot;Billboard&quot;

&quot;Paris is a force of gravity under which perpetrators melt of embarrassment...his musical genius is rhyme...Paris is a gun to your head, so listen up.&quot;
- Vox

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; praised the &quot;diverse, imaginative and burningly intense self-produced tracks.&quot;

<text>The 1899 VFL season was the third season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 13 May to 16 September, comprising a 14-round home-and-away season followed by a finals series featuring all eight clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by one point in the 1899 VFL grand final; it was Fitzroy&#x27;s second (consecutive and overall) VFL premiership. Fitzroy also won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with an 11–3 win–loss record. &#x27;s Eddy James won his second leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1899, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot; (although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match).

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds.

Once the 14 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1899 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the 1898 VFL finals system.

==Season notes==
* The VFL reduced the size of its teams from 20 to 18 on-the-field players, with no &quot;reserves&quot;. In doing this, the number of followers was reduced from five (four rucks and a rover) to three (two rucks and a rover).
* The third round, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Birthday&quot; holiday match, between Collingwood and St Kilda at Victoria Park was held in the morning of Wednesday 24 May 1899.
* Norman &quot;Hackenschmidt&quot; Clark, a footballer with the North Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian Football Association, won the 1899, 130-yard Stawell Gift in eleven and four-fifths seconds, off a handicap of 14 and a half yards. Clark would later play 125 senior games for Carlton (1905–1912), captain-coach VFA team Brighton (1913), and coach Carlton (1914–1918; 1920–1922), Richmond (1919), North Melbourne (1924 and 1931) and St Kilda (1925–1926).
* At half-time of the Round 13 game between Fitzroy and Collingwood, Fitzroy captain Alec Sloan offers Collingwood captain Dick Condon the use of a fresh football, due to the old ball being greasy. Condon declines, and Colingwood win the game 5.7 (37) to 3.7 (25).
* The first seven kicks of the Round 14 game between Carlton and Fitzroy are free kicks awarded by the umpire.
* In the third sectional round, Geelong set records for the highest score in a game, scoring 23.24 (162), and the highest winning margin of 161 points, against St Kilda. These records would both stand for twelve years and twenty years respectively.
* St Kilda&#x27;s score of 0.1 (1) in the same match set the record for the lowest score in a VFL/AFL game, which has neither been matched nor broken since. Notably, the solitary behind was actually the &quot;first score&quot; of the match.
* Geelong&#x27;s Jim McShane kicked 11 goals in the same match against St Kilda, a VFL record that was not equalled until Collingwood&#x27;s Dick Lee&#x27;s 11 goals in 1914 and not broken until 1922; this is more impressive considering that McShane was usually a ruckman.
* Warwick Armstrong (6&#x27;3&quot;, 190 cm), later captain of the Australian Test Cricket team, played in the ruck for the South Melbourne team that lost the 1899 &quot;Grand Final&quot;.
* At the end of the 1899 season, in the process of naming his own &quot;champion player&quot;, the football correspondent for &quot;The Argus&quot; (&quot;Old Boy&quot;), selected a team of the best players of the 1899 VFL competition:&lt;br&gt;Backs: Maurie Collins (Essendon), Bill Proudfoot (Collingwood), Peter Burns (Geelong); Halfbacks: Pat Hickey (Fitzroy), George Davidson (South Melbourne), Alf Wood (Melbourne); Centres: Fred Leach (Collingwood), Firth McCallum (Geelong), Harry Wright (Essendon); Wings: Charlie Pannam (Collingwood), Eddie Drohan (Fitzroy), Herb Howson (South Melbourne); Forwards: Bill Jackson (Essendon), Eddy James (Geelong), Charlie Colgan (South Melbourne); Ruck: Mick Pleass (South Melbourne), Frank Hailwood (Collingwood), Joe McShane (Geelong); Rovers: Dick Condon (Collingwood), Bill McSpeerin (Fitzroy), Teddy Rankin (Geelong).&lt;br&gt;From those he considered to be the three best players — that is, Condon, Hickey, and Pleass — he selected Pat Hickey as his &quot;champion player&quot; of the season. (&#x27;Old Boy&#x27;, &quot;Football: A Review of the Season&quot;, (Monday, 18 September 1899), p.6).

==Awards==
* The 1899 VFL Premiership team was Fitzroy.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Eddy James of Geelong with 31 goals.
* &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; was Fitzroy&#x27;s Pat Hickey.

<text>José Luis Burciaga Jr. (born November 16, 1981, in Oak Cliff, Texas) is an American retired soccer player who is currently the General Manager of Keene FC. He is the former founder of Wizards Futbol Club, a youth soccer academy.

==Career==
Burciaga played youth soccer for the Dallas Texans Soccer Club and graduated from Duncanville High School where he was the 2000 District 7 soccer MVP and two-time All State. Instead of attending college, Burciaga opted to turn professional after finishing high school, signing a Project-40 contract with MLS.

Burciaga was selected 12th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. Although a star with United States youth national teams, he was not immediately ready for MLS. He played two games on loan to the Portland Timbers of the USL A-League. He also played three games for Project 40 and one game with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in an August 2001 U.S. Open Cup game. He finished the season with the Wizards with three games, two of them starts.

Burciaga tore his left knee&#x27;s ACL in preseason and missed the entire 2002 season rehabbing the injury. He came on strong in 2003, earning the left back starting position in preseason and looking poised to finally come into his own; he tore his right knee&#x27;s ACL in the fourth game of the season and so finished the year with only those four starts. After two painful years, Burciaga returned to the Wizards&#x27; lineup in 2004 and was injury-free for the entire year. Given the opportunity, he seized the left back position and kept it all year long. He finished the season with 21 starts out of 24 games played, and added one goal and one assist.

In 2005, Burciaga was selected out of all the MLS players to the MLS Select team vs. Real Madrid at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu for the Trofeo Bernabeu. 2006 was Burciaga&#x27;s breakout year, as he scored 8 goals and 8 assists, several of them spectacular, in earning MLS Best XI honors for the first time and team MVP.

Burciaga was traded by the Kansas City Wizards to league rivals Colorado Rapids on January 16, 2008, in return for a 2009 second round 2009 MLS SuperDraft pick. Colorado opted not to renew his contract for the 2009 season.

Burciaga trialed with Orlando City during the 2011 preseason but was not offered a contract with the team. In the spring of 2012, Burciaga attempted to earn a roster spot with MLS side D.C. United but was not successful. He ended up playing in 2012 for the Atlanta Silverbacks of the second division NASL.

Burciaga returned to professional soccer in late 2018, signing with the Major Arena Soccer League&#x27;s Dallas Sidekicks.

==Jose Burciaga Jr. Academy==
In 2002, Burciaga founded the Wizards Futbol Club in Dallas, Texas. Established by Jose Luis Burciaga Sr. and Jose Luis Burciaga Jr., Wizards FC is a community based not for profit organization designed to provide a high level of training and development that will prepare all players for college and beyond.

At the 2014 Dallas Cup, Wizards FC had two teams participating with one team going to the finals.

===Partnership===
On August 4, 2014, Wolverhampton Wanderers of England agreed to a partnership with Wizards FC. Wizards FC coaches and players will have the opportunity to work with the academy coaches of Wolves in both North America and England, offering an insight into the player development program of one of the top English soccer academies. The partnership will provide players and coaches access to a club renowned for producing world class players.

The partnership will see the Wolves North American Academy hosting a series of Elite Player ID events with Wizards FC. Wolves will send Academy staff members over to work with Wizards FC players at these events. The best male and female players at these events will be invited to attend the Wolves National Camp. The National Camp will host the top players from each of partner club in North America. From the National Camp, the top players will be invited to attend the Elite Player Tour at Wolves&#x27; Academy in Wolverhampton, England.

Jose Luis Burciaga Jr. stated that: &quot;We are excited about our new partnership with Wolves, and we are looking forward to working together to help develop our young players to become the next generation of soccer players. Thank you to Global Image Sports for thinking about our club, and thank you Wolves for the opportunity.&quot;

==Honors==
*U.S. Open Cup Champion: 2004
*MLS Cup Runner Up: 2004

===Individual===
*MLS Best XI: 2006
*KC Wizards MVP: 2006
*MLS Humanitarian of the Year: 2008

Burciaga Jr. was recognized as an exemplary athlete within the community based on his work with the U.S. Soccer Foundation&#x27;s Passback Program and the establishment of his foundation, the Jose Luis Burciaga Jr. Foundation. Burciaga Jr.&#x27;s foundation focuses on the positive impact of sports and the ideals of teamwork, discipline, and respect in the developing of young minds. The foundation promotes youth involvement in sports, education, community service, and cultural awareness.

*Top 50 MLS Moment #29. Bomb Drop: 2004

In 132 games played in MLS, Burciaga scored 14 times. But not many of his blasts were more impressive, and certainly none came on a bigger stage, than his goal in the 2004 MLS Cup against D.C. United at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. &quot;He can crush a ball,&quot; said former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad. &quot;He can crush it, and even if it skips a few times, you know it&#x27;s going in.&quot; &quot;That was the first goal scored on me in MLS Cup, so I took it pretty hard,&quot; recalled Nick Rimando, now manning the nets for Real Salt Lake. &quot;Ryan Nelsen was right there, and it went by him, and that&#x27;s why I reacted a bit slow to it. If I’d seen it, I would’ve probably reacted a little earlier. But [Burciaga] hit it well and I reacted slow, and it cost us a goal. It was kind of a shock.&quot;

<doc id="1157143" wikidata="Q1928607" url="?curid=1157143" title="Page fault">
<text>In computing, a page fault is an exception that the memory management unit (MMU) raises when a process accesses a memory page without proper preparations. Accessing the page requires a mapping to be added to the process&#x27;s virtual address space. Furthermore, the actual page contents may need to be loaded from a back-up, e.g. a disk. The MMU detects the page fault, but the operating system&#x27;s kernel handles the exception by making the required page accessible in the physical memory or denying an illegal memory access.

Valid page faults are common and necessary to increase the amount of memory available to programs in any operating system that uses virtual memory, such as Windows, macOS, and the Linux kernel.

== Types ==

=== Minor ===
If the page is loaded in memory at the time the fault is generated, but is not marked in the memory management unit as being loaded in memory, then it is called a minor or soft page fault. The page fault handler in the operating system merely needs to make the entry for that page in the memory management unit point to the page in memory and indicate that the page is loaded in memory; it does not need to read the page into memory. This could happen if the memory is shared by different programs and the page is already brought into memory for other programs.

=== Major ===
This is the mechanism used by an operating system to increase the amount of program memory available on demand. The operating system delays loading parts of the program from disk until the program attempts to use it and the page fault is generated. If the page is not loaded in memory at the time of the fault, then it is called a major or hard page fault. The page fault handler in the OS needs to find a free location: either a free page in memory, or a non-free page in memory. This latter might be used by another process, in which case the OS needs to write out the data in that page (if it has not been written out since it was last modified) and mark that page as not being loaded in memory in its process page table. Once the space has been made available, the OS can read the data for the new page into memory, add an entry to its location in the memory management unit, and indicate that the page is loaded. Thus major faults are more expensive than minor faults and add storage access latency to the interrupted program&#x27;s execution.

=== Invalid ===
If a page fault occurs for a reference to an address that is not part of the virtual address space, meaning there cannot be a page in memory corresponding to it, then it is called an invalid page fault. The page fault handler in the operating system will then generally pass a segmentation fault to the offending process, indicating that the access was invalid; this usually results in abnormal termination of the code that made the invalid reference. A null pointer is usually represented as a pointer to address 0 in the address space; many operating systems set up the MMU to indicate that the page that contains that address is not in memory, and do not include that page in the virtual address space, so that attempts to read or write the memory referenced by a null pointer get an invalid page fault.

== Invalid conditions ==
Illegal accesses and invalid page faults can result in a segmentation fault or bus error, resulting in an app or OS crash. Software bugs are often the causes of these problems, but hardware memory errors, such as those caused by overclocking, may corrupt pointers and cause valid code to fail.

Operating systems provide differing mechanisms for reporting page fault errors. Microsoft Windows uses structured exception handling to report invalid page faults as access violation exceptions. UNIX-like systems typically use signals, such as SIGSEGV, to report these error conditions to programs. If the program receiving the error does not handle it, the operating system performs a default action, typically involving the termination of the running process that caused the error condition, and notifying the user that the program has malfunctioned. Windows often reports such crashes without going to any details. An experienced user can retrieve detailed information using WinDbg and the minidump that Windows creates during the crash. UNIX-like operating systems report these conditions with such error messages as &quot;segmentation violation&quot; or &quot;bus error&quot;, and may produce a core dump.

== Performance impact ==

Page faults degrade system performance and can cause thrashing. Major page faults on conventional computers using hard disk drives can have a significant impact on their performance, as an average hard disk drive has an average rotational latency of 3 ms, a seek time of 5 ms, and a transfer time of 0.05 ms/page. Therefore, the total time for paging is near 8 ms (= 8,000 μs). If the memory access time is 0.2 μs, then the page fault would make the operation about 40,000 times slower.

Performance optimization of programs or operating systems often involves reducing the number of page faults. Two primary focuses of the optimization are reducing overall memory usage and improving memory locality. To reduce the page faults, developers must use an appropriate page replacement algorithm that maximizes the page hits. Many have been proposed, such as implementing heuristic algorithms to reduce the incidence of page faults.

A larger physical memory also reduces page faults.

<doc id="1157147" wikidata="Q231453" url="?curid=1157147" title="Marie of Anjou">
<text>Marie of Anjou (14 October 1404 – 29 November 1463) was Queen of France as the spouse of King Charles VII from 1422 to 1461. She served as regent and presided over the council of state several times during the absence of the king.

==Life==
Marie was the eldest daughter of Louis II of Anjou, claimant to the throne of Naples, and Yolande of Aragon, claimant to the throne of Aragon.

Marie was betrothed to her second cousin Charles, son and heir apparent of Charles VI of France, in 1413. When a Burgundian force took Paris in 1418, Charles left her stranded, but she was taken by John the Fearless to Saumur to be reunited with him. However, Charles failed to arrive for the agreed rendezvous.

The wedding took place on 18 December 1422 at Bourges. The marriage made Marie Queen of France, but she was never crowned. Her spouse&#x27;s victory in the Hundred Years&#x27; War owed a great deal to the support he received from Marie&#x27;s family, notably from her mother Yolande of Aragon.

===Queen===
Queen Marie presided over the council of state several times in the absence of the king, during which she had power of attorney as regent and signed acts in the position of &quot;lieutenant of the king&quot; (April 1434). 
She made several pilgrimages, such as Puy with the king in 1424, and Mount St Michel by herself in 1447.

Marie and Charles had fourteen children, but her spouse&#x27;s affection was primarily directed towards his mistress, Agnès Sorel, originally Marie&#x27;s lady in waiting, who became official mistress to the king in 1444 and played a dominant role at court until her death in 1450, somewhat eclipsing the queen.

Robert Blondel composed the allegorical Treatise of the &quot;Twelve Perils of Hell&quot; for Queen Marie in 1455.

===Queen dowager===
In 1461, Charles VII died and was succeeded by their son Louis XI, making Marie queen dowager. She was granted the Chateau of Amboise and the income from Brabant by her son.

During the winter of 1462–63, Marie of Anjou made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. It has been speculated that she had a mission in Spain as secret ambassador for her son, due to the political situation at the time and the fact that she made the pilgrimage during winter time, when the roads were so bad that such trips were normally avoided if possible.

She died at the age of 59 on 29 November 1463 at the Cistercian Abbaye de Chateliers-en-Poitou (now in Nouvelle-Aquitaine region) on her return. She is buried in the basilica of Saint-Denis alongside her spouse.

==Issue==

<doc id="1157152" wikidata="Q1294018" url="?curid=1157152" title="Adi people">
<text>The Adi people are one of the most populous groups of indigenous peoples in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. A few thousand are also found in the Tibet Autonomous Region, where they are called the Lhoba together with some of the Nyishi people, Na people, Mishmi people and Tagin people.

They live in a region of the Southern Himalayas which falls within the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Mainling, Lhunze, Zayu, Medog, and Nyingchi counties in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China. The present habitat of the Adi people is heavily influenced by the historic location of the ancient Lhoyu. They are found in the temperate and sub-tropical regions within the districts of Siang, East Siang, Upper Siang, Lower Dibang Valley, Shi Yomi,Namsai within Arunachal Pradesh. The term &quot;Adi&quot; however, is not to be confused with the Lhoba people, since the Lhoba also includes the Mishmi along with the Adi people. All the ethnic groups recognizing themselves as &quot;Adi&quot; are believed to be descendants of the Abutani/Abotani. The older term &quot;Abor&quot; is an exonym from Assamese and its literal meaning is &quot;independent&quot;. The literal meaning of &quot;adi&quot; is &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;mountain top&quot;.

== Organisation of the community ==
The Adi live in hill villages, each traditionally keeping to itself, under a selected chief styled &quot;Gam&quot; or &quot;Gao Burra&quot; who moderates the village council, which acts even as the traditional court, referred to as a &quot;Kebang&quot;. The olden day councils consisted of all the village elders and decisions were decided in a &quot;Musup/Dere&quot; (village community house).

== Language ==

The various languages and dialects of the Adi people fall into two groups: Abor (Abor-Minyong, Bor-abor (Padam), Abor-Miri, etc.) and Lhoba (Lho-Pa, Luoba).

Adi literature has been developed by Christian missionaries since 1900. The missionaries J. H. Lorrain and F. W. Savidge published an &quot;Abor-Miri Dictionary&quot; in 1906 with the help of Mupak Mili and Atsong Pertin, considered the fathers of the Adi language or Adi script.

Adi is taught as a third language in schools of communities dominated by the Adi.

The Adi speak Hindi as a lingua-franca for communicating with other indigenous groups of people in Arunachal Pradesh and the other northeast states. 
== Culture ==


Dormitories play an important role among the Adi people, and certain rules governing the dormitories are observed. For example, a male can visit the dormitory of a female, although he is not allowed to stay overnight. At times, guardians will have to be around to guide the youngsters.

There are separate dresses for women and men which are woven by women of the tribes. Helmets made from cane, bear, and deerskin are sometimes worn by the men, depending on the region.

While the older women wear yellow necklaces and spiral earrings, unmarried girls wear a , an ornament that consists of five to six brass plates fixed under their petticoats. Tattooing was popular among the older women.

The traditional measure of a family&#x27;s wealth is the possession of domestic animals (particularly gayals), beads and ornaments, and land.

=== Festivals and dances ===
The Adi celebrate a number of festivals, in particular, their prime festivals are &quot;Aran&quot;, &quot;Donggin&quot;, Solung, Podi Barbii and &quot;Etor&quot;. Solung is observed in the first week of September for five days or more. It is a harvest festival performed after the sowing of seeds and transplantation, to seek for future bumper crops. &quot;Ponung&quot; songs and dances are performed by women folk during the festival. On the last day of Solung, throne and indigenous weaponry are displayed along the passage of the houses – a belief that they would protect people from evil spirits (This ritual is called &quot;Taktor&quot;).

Adi dances vary from the slow, rustic and beautifully enchanting Ponung style (performed in Solung festival) to the exhilarating, exuberant thumps of &quot;Delong&quot; performed by men during the Etor festival. These dances have led to certain forms of dancing which jointly narrate a story, the &quot;Tapu&quot; (War Dance). In the Tapu, the dancers vigorously re-enact the actions of war, its gory details and the triumphant cries of the warriors. &quot;Yakjong&quot; is performed in the Aran festival. This is another kind of dance whereby the dancers carry sticks with designs created by removing the barks in certain patterns and then put into the fire for some time, which creates the marked black designs.

== Lifestyle ==

The Adi practice wet rice cultivation and have a considerable agricultural economy. Rice serves as the staple food for them along with meat and other vegetables

== Religion ==
The majority of Adi traditionally follow the tribal Donyi-Polo religion. Worship of gods and goddesses like &quot;Kine Nane&quot;, &quot;Doying Bote&quot;, &quot;Gumin Soyin&quot; and &quot;Pedong Nane,&quot; etc., and religious observances are led by a shaman, called &quot;Miri&quot; (can be a female). Each deity is associated with certain tasks and acts as a protector and guardian of various topics related to nature which revolves around their daily life. This includes the food crops, home, rain, etc.

Adi in Tibet, in particular the Bokars, have adopted Tibetan Buddhism to a certain extent, as a result of Tibetan influence. However, in recent years a revival in indigenous identity on the part of the Tibetan Adi people has made traditional religion popular with the youth again. In modern times, a few Adi people have converted to Christianity. But been increasing and call of local leaders to stop converting and demographics shift.

<doc id="1157158" wikidata="Q602600" url="?curid=1157158" title="Death to Smoochy">
<text>Death to Smoochy is a 2002 satirical black comedy crime film directed by Danny DeVito and written by Adam Resnick. Starring Robin Williams, Edward Norton, Catherine Keener, DeVito, and Jon Stewart, the film centers on &quot;Rainbow&quot; Randolph Smiley (Williams), a disgraced former children&#x27;s television host who attempts to sabotage his replacement, Sheldon Mopes (Norton), and his character, Smoochy the Rhino.

Produced by FilmFour and Andrew Lazar&#x27;s Mad Chance Productions, &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; was released in the United States on March 29, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was met with mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb, grossing $8.3 million against a budget of $50 million.

== Plot ==
&quot;Rainbow&quot; Randolph Smiley is the host of a popular children&#x27;s television show on Kidnet. Despite appearing friendly and playful onscreen in the studio, he is in reality an alcoholic and a criminal. The FBI arrests him for accepting bribes and he is fired, his show is canceled, and he is evicted from his penthouse and left homeless. Kidnet orders executive Marion Stokes to hire a new host who is &quot;squeaky clean&quot;. Stokes selects the naive Sheldon Mopes and his character Smoochy the Rhino. Mopes is uniquely sincere and dedicated to providing quality children&#x27;s entertainment with his show &quot;Smoochy&#x27;s Magic Jungle&quot;, which puts him at odds with his new producer, Nora Wells.

Mopes&#x27;s show quickly becomes tremendously popular, causing Rainbow Randolph to fixate his anger on Mopes. Randolph turns to Stokes and pleads for help to get his job back, but Stokes refuses. The deranged Randolph hatches several poorly planned attempts to have Mopes fired, all of which fail. Finally hitting rock bottom, Randolph turns to his former partner, Angelo Pike, for help. Angelo feeds Randolph and allows him to stay at his apartment.

Mopes feels that he is losing creative control over his show and hires corrupt talent agent Burke Bennett to renegotiate his contract. Bennett introduces Mopes to the dark side of the entertainment business by giving him a gun and trying to convince him to work with a corrupt charity. While having dinner with Burke, Mopes is introduced to mobster Tommy Cotter. Tommy pressures Mopes into giving her cousin Spinner a role on his show, and Mopes casts him as Smoochy&#x27;s cousin Moochy. Tommy tells Mopes that in return for casting Spinner, she will make sure he is protected.

Burke becomes impatient with Mopes and books him to star in a Smoochy ice show, run by Merv Green and his corrupt charity, Parade of Hope. Mopes refuses to do the show despite Burke&#x27;s warnings; in response, Green personally threatens Mopes to do the show. In the meantime, Randolph manages to trick Mopes into performing at a Neo-Nazi rally. Mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show, and Nora refuses to help him. Randolph visits Nora to ask for his job back but accidentally reveals that he set up Mopes. Nora tells Tommy, who tracks down Randolph with her crew and forces him to confess that he tricked Mopes. Mopes&#x27;s reputation and show are restored, and the media dubs Randolph the most hated man in America. Angelo kicks Randolph out of his apartment after Randolph angrily destroys his television. Nora and Mopes reconnect and begin a romantic relationship.

Mopes decides to host his own ice show, without the corrupt charities involved. Burke and Stokes, under pressure from Green, plot to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will accommodate their corruption. Their plan backfires when Green&#x27;s men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Mopes and murder him. An enraged Tommy retaliates by killing Green and his men. Randolph confronts Mopes and Nora in their apartment at gunpoint and reveals that Nora had affairs with several kid show hosts, including himself. Mopes manages to calm Randolph down and disarm him, allowing Randolph to remain in the apartment until Mopes can explain everything to the police.

Burke and Stokes decide to hire former Kidnet host Buggy Ding Dong to kill Sheldon during the ice show. Randolph intervenes and saves Mopes by killing Buggy. Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up and threatens Burke with a gun. Tommy and her crew arrive in time to stop Mopes, and Tommy decides to handle the matter herself. Mopes and Nora kiss in Times Square, and Smoochy and Randolph launch a new show together alongside Nora, who becomes an ice skater.

== Cast ==
* Robin Williams as &quot;Rainbow&quot; Randolph Smiley, a television kid show host who falls from grace after being arrested for accepting bribes. The loss of his job and home causes Randolph to become emotionally disturbed, and he becomes fixated on having Mopes fired so that he can return to his old life.
* Edward Norton as Sheldon Mopes/Smoochy the Rhino, a struggling entertainer who Kidnet taps as Rainbow Randolph&#x27;s replacement. He is considered &quot;squeaky clean&quot; as he lives a scandal-free life and teaches positivity and healthy living with his act. He is also very idealistic and struggles to adapt to the dark world of television.
* Danny DeVito as Burke Bennett, a corrupt talent agent who represents Mopes in his contract negotiations with Kidnet. Burke is involved in embezzling money from charity events that his clients host, and he pressures Mopes to cooperate with the scheme.
* Catherine Keener as Nora Wells, a bitter, disillusioned television producer who coordinates the filming of Kidnet&#x27;s shows. She and Mopes clash at first but develop a romantic relationship.
* Jon Stewart as Marion Frank Stokes, a Kidnet executive who oversees the network programming. He is also involved in embezzling money and is torn between the network&#x27;s orders and the pressure that he receives to get skimmed money flowing again. 
* Pam Ferris as Tommy Cotter, a boss in the Irish mob. She convinces Mopes to give her cousin Spinner a part on TV; to show her gratitude, she vows to protect Mopes from harm.
* Michael Rispoli as Lawrence &quot;Spinner&quot; Dunn/Moochy the Rhino, a retired boxer with brain damage who becomes obsessed with &quot;The Smoochy Show&quot;. Mopes gives Spinner the role of Moochy at the urging of Tommy Cotter.
* Harvey Fierstein as Merv Green, the morally corrupt organizer of the Parade of Hope charity. Green uses Kidnet talent to host fundraising ice shows, with the proceeds syphoned for personal gain.
* Danny Woodburn as Angelo Pike, a former cast member on Rainbow Randolph&#x27;s show who goes to work for &quot;The Smoochy Show&quot;. He is the only person willing to help the deranged Randolph, giving him a place to stay and taking care of him. 
* Vincent Schiavelli as Buggy Ding Dong, another former Kidnet show host who ends up a homeless heroin addict. In desperation, Burke and Stokes hire him to murder Mopes, with the promise of getting his old show back if he succeeds.
* Robert Prosky as the Chairman of Kidnet. He orders Stokes to find a new show host that won&#x27;t generate any controversy.
* Tracey Walter as Ben Franks
* Todd Graff as Skip Kleinman

== Production ==
===Preproduction===
In November or December 2000, screenwriter Adam Resnick wrote the screenplay for the film, while art designers sketched designs for the characters. In the original screenplay, the Smoochy costume was orange. The final film used a pink costume instead.

Resnick said the film mostly stayed true to his script, although the original was fifteen pages too long, and that subplots and a narrator had to be removed. Edward Norton was the first person Resnick brought the script to, as the character had been written for him.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in January 2001. Sequences were filmed in several locations in New York City, such as Times Square, Coney Island, Upper West Side and Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. A brief shot of the North Tower of the World Trade Center can be seen where Rainbow Randolph is dancing on the small bench in Duane Park. In the DVD commentary, Danny DeVito said that it was the only shot in the movie in which the towers are seen. No changes were made after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Filming production moved to Canada in spring 2001. The Kidnet studio scenes were shot in several areas in Toronto. In the ice-show scene with Smoochy and Rainbow, Robin Williams&#x27;s stunt double Elvis Stojko choreographed some of the skating moves for Rainbow Randolph. Robin was offstage. Filming ended in May 2001.

== Home media ==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002 by Warner Home Video. The film was later released on Blu-ray by boutique distributor Shout Factory on August 20, 2024. The Blu-ray was based on a new 2K restoration made with the film&#x27;s original interpositive.

== Reception ==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; holds an approval rating of 42%, based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The talent involved can&#x27;t save a script that has nowhere to go with its promising premise.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film an extremely negative review (giving it half a star out of four), saying, &quot;Only enormously talented people could have made &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;. Those with lesser gifts would have lacked the nerve to make a film so bad, so miscalculated, so lacking any connection with any possible audience. To make a film this awful, you have to have enormous ambition and confidence, and dream big dreams.&quot; He named the film the Worst of the Year.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a negative review, saying that it &quot;pushes its dark, smart, clever, cynical, satirical, nasty, provocative and sarcastic instincts to the point of heavily diminished returns—to the point where the very amusing premise just isn&#x27;t funny anymore.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;This black-comic assault on family entertainment is going to set a lot of teeth on edge—If only his [DeVito&#x27;s] material were better this time.&quot;

Conversely, J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised the film, saying, &quot;&quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; is often very funny, but what&#x27;s even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito&#x27;s misanthropic vision.&quot;

David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; called the film a &quot;razor-sharp satire&quot; and &quot;the most refreshingly outrageous movie of the season&quot;.

===Box office===
Although it received a wide release in the United States by playing in 2,164 theaters during its opening weekend, the film was a box-office bomb after grossing $4,266,463 in its opening weekend and $8,382,691 overall against a $50 million budget, with negligible box-office receipts outside the North American market.

===Accolades===
Robin Williams received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance as Randolph in this film, but lost to Hayden Christensen for his performance in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;.

<text>The Museum of Medieval Stockholm (), centrally located north of the Royal Palace, was constructed around old monuments excavated in an extensive archaeological dig (dubbed &quot;Riksgropen&quot;, &quot;National/State Pit&quot;) in the late 1970s. Part of Stockholm&#x27;s city wall, dating from the early 16th century, was also found. In order to make the finds accessible to the general public, a planned subterranean garage had to give way to the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, which was inaugurated in 1986. Museum director Margareta Hallerdt created a visionary state-of-the-art museum, designed by artist Kerstin Rydh, that received both national and international acclaim and won the European Museum of the Year Award in 1986.

The museum was closed from June 15, 2007, until early 2010 during the restoration of the bridge Norrbro. During this period, the exhibition was rebuilt while a minor temporary exhibition was available in Kulturhuset at Sergels torg.

The museum enables visitors to experience medieval Stockholm, with its brick houses and booths, workshops, harbour and gallows. It relates the medieval history of the city from the 1250s to the 1520s. In 2010, to celebrate 800 years since the birth of Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm, the museum opened an exhibition with a reconstruction of his face.

The Museum of Medieval Stockholm produces theme exhibitions with a medieval emphasis and arranges lectures, symposia and programmes. It engages in broad educational activities, in which children, youth and schools are a key target group. The museum has a shop that sells books relating to the Middle Ages, and also postcards and jewelry.

The museum closed at its current location in November 2023 in order to pack up and move to its new location in Börshuset at Stortorget in the Old Town. The move was necessitated by the take over of the museum&#x27;s space by The Administrative Office of the Swedish Parliament. It is unknown when the museum will reopen in its new location as it will be taking over the space currently occupied by the Nobel Prize Museum, which itself is relocating.

<doc id="1157161" wikidata="Q5483419" url="?curid=1157161" title="Francisco Gomez (soccer, born 1979)">
<text>Francisco Gomez (born January 25, 1979, in Watsonville, California) is an American former soccer player.

==Club career==
Gomez joined the Kansas City Wizards in 1999, after playing briefly with the California Jaguars of the A-League. He saw little playing time in his first two years, however - as a rookie, he appeared in seven games, scoring one goal, while in his second year he appeared in 14 (seven starts), scoring two goals and one assist. Gomez played a key role in Kansas City&#x27;s road to MLS Cup 2000 scoring the game winner in quarterfinal game against the Colorado Rapids. Gomez began to see significantly increased playing time in 2001, when he appeared in 24 games, 18 of them starts, while scoring four goals and six assists. Gomez kept something of a utility role during his later MLS career. In his six years with Kansas City, Gomez appeared in 114 games, registering 14 goals and 14 assists. After the 2004 season, he was selected seventh overall in the MLS Expansion Draft by Chivas USA.

Gomez was released by Chivas in the middle of the 2006 season, and joined Miami FC in the USL First Division for the remainder of the season where he made seven appearances and scored 1 goal.

In January 2007, Gomez was hired as the new player-coach of Bakersfield Brigade.

==National team==
Although Gomez played a significant role for several of the United States youth national teams, he never earned a cap with the senior team. He captained the US in the 1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and was a significant part of the U-20 national team, playing alongside Tim Howard, Carlos Bocanegra, Steve Cherendolo in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria.

<text>Arndale Centres were the first &quot;American style&quot; malls to be built in the United Kingdom. In total, Arndale Property Trust built 23 Arndale Centres in the United Kingdom, and three in Australia. The first opened in Jarrow, County Durham, in 1961, as a pedestrianised shopping area.

==History==
In 1950, Arnold Hagenbach, a baker with a talent for property investment, and Sam Chippendale, an estate agent from Otley, set up a company called the Arndale Property Trust, the name being a portmanteau of &quot;Arnold&quot; and &quot;Chippendale&quot;.

Prior to developing a string of large shopping centres, Arndale initially started to build new stretches of high streets as canopied shopping parades in a variety of small towns across the North of England as well as suburban centres. These early developments introduced large format shop units to post-war town centres in need of regeneration that suited the growth of growing businesses such as Woolworths and Marks and Spencer. Developments were often in conjunction with local councils to deliver new infrastructure such as roads or markets. 

The trust purchased Bradford&#x27;s Victorian Swan Arcade in 1954, with the intention of demolishing it and developing a new shopping centre, but it took eight years before leases expired and building work could commence, so in the meantime it developed a site in Jarrow, County Durham, which became the first Arndale Centre when it opened in 1961. Its trademark Viking statue, built by the Trust, was unveiled on 17 February 1962.

Arndale&#x27;s first office was in Wakefield, West Yorkshire and moved to offices in Bradford in 1964 in the then-new Arndale House

When the Wandsworth Arndale opened in 1971, it was the largest indoor shopping space in Europe. 

The largest Arndale Centre built was Manchester Arndale. It was redeveloped from 1996, after being badly damaged in an IRA bombing, and the centre has been owned by Prudential since December 1998.

==Criticism==
Arndale Centres attracted criticism on aesthetic grounds as they replaced old buildings – often of the Victorian period – with modern concrete constructions, often in a brutalist style.

The value of the Wandsworth Arndale was maximised by the high rise tower blocks built on top of the mall, which helped it to become, according to some commentators, &quot;one of London’s great architectural disasters&quot;.

==References in popular culture==
The phrase &quot;the Arndale Centre wasn&#x27;t built in a day&quot; (in place of &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day&quot;) was used in the film &quot;Little Voice&quot;. A sketch in an episode of &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; about greetings cards with very specific tailored messages inside features a card with the greeting &quot;Sorry to hear your teeth fell out in the Arndale Centre&quot;. Numerous other references to Arndale Centres exist in the show.

In an episode of &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, Nana is said to have a &quot;spin out&quot; outside Timpson&#x27;s Shoe Shop (now closed) in the Stretford Arndale or precinct as it is known locally. British band Squeeze referenced the mall in the song &quot;It&#x27;s Not Cricket&quot;, from their 1979 album, &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, with the lyrics: &quot;at the Arndale Centre, she&#x27;s up against the wall.&quot;

On his track &quot;the N. W. R. A.&quot; on The Fall&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Grotesque (After the Gramme)&quot;, Manchester singer Mark E. Smith described the destruction of the Arndale as part of an apocalyptic &#x27;future rising&#x27; of the North. 

In the first Christmas special episode of &quot;The Worst Week of My Life&quot;, &quot;The Worst Christmas of my Life&quot;, Howard refers to visiting Santa&#x27;s Grotto at the Arndale Centre. In series four, episode four &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock and Roll&quot; of &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot;, an Arndale Centre is mentioned, but it is not specific as to whether it is the Wandsworth or Dartford centre that is being referred to.

Characters in the television series &quot;Coronation Street&quot; occasionally reference going shopping in the Manchester Arndale Centre, the television series being set in Greater Manchester.

In the 2015 advert for Warburtons giant crumpets, the Muppets sing &quot;it&#x27;s time to hit the Arndale / to get some bigger plates&quot;.

<text>Stéphane Picq (16 August 1965 – 3 February 2025) was a French composer of video game music, primarily for ERE Informatique/Exxos and Cryo Interactive.

==History==
Picq first began composing in 1987. He retired from the industry in 1998 and moved to Madagascar. In February 2006, he announced that he was building a new studio in Madagascar and might release a compilation of old songs.

On 13 November 2015, ZOOM Platform and the Jordan Freeman Group revealed that Picq, original musical composer for &quot;MegaRace 1&quot;, had joined the MegaRace Reboot Team and would be composing the soundtrack with other team members, including Jordan Freeman and Max Petrosky, along with some special guests. The news had actually broken on the previous day, 12 November 2015, via the MegaRace Reboot&#x27;s official Facebook page.

On 22 August 2016, ZOOM Platform and the Jordan Freeman Group released Picq&#x27;s complete &quot;MegaRace 1&quot; soundtrack re-mastered in stereo for the first time ever on various digital download services including Amazon MP3, CDBaby, Google Play, and iTunes.

In an interview in July 2020, he looked back on his career and in particular on the reasons that led him to leave the video game industry. The composer explained that the lack of artistic freedom made him tired.

In 2023, Picq announced on Eklecty-City the reissue of &quot;&quot;, the original soundtrack to the video game &quot;Dune&quot;, released in 1992.

Picq died in February 2025, at the age of 59.

==Musical style==
Picq claimed to own dozens of instruments from all over the world and the ability to play all of them. His musical style incorporated &quot;organic sonority&quot;, as he features many &quot;organic sounds&quot; such as breaths, water, sighs. The most representative examples are found in &quot;&quot;, but this technique is also used on other Cryo soundtracks (for example, &quot;Thaa&#x27;s Secret&quot; in &quot;Lost Eden&quot;).

==Selected works==
*&quot;Extase&quot;
*&quot;KGB&quot;
*&quot;&quot; (the soundtrack to the game &quot;Dune&quot;)
*&quot;MegaRace&quot;
*&quot;Commander Blood&quot;
*&quot;Dragon Lore&quot;
*&quot;Lost Eden&quot;

<doc id="1157179" wikidata="Q4384547" url="?curid=1157179" title="USS Diodon">
<text>USS &quot;Diodon&quot; (SS-349), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for &quot;Diodon&quot;, a genus of the porcupine fishes.

&quot;Diodon&quot; (SS-349) was launched 10 September 1945 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. D. Cullinane; and commissioned 18 March 1946.

&quot;Diodon&quot; arrived at San Diego, California, 5 July 1946, and during the next four years joined in training operations along the West Coast, in Alaskan waters, and in the Hawaiian Islands, as well as training members of the Naval Reserve. It received an extensive GUPPY II modernization at Mare Island Naval Shipyard between August 1947 and March 1948.

On 14 September 1950 &quot;Diodon&quot; sailed for the Far East, rescuing six aviators off Guam during its passage. It trained frigates of the Republic of Korea in antisubmarine warfare in Sagami Wan, Japan, and from 30 October to 28 November made a simulated war patrol. It passed undetected through Tsugaru Strait to Otaru, Hokkaidō, then continued to patrol undetected as it observed and photographed shipping in La Perouse Strait. it returned to the West Coast for overhaul from February to May 1951.

Resuming its west coast operations, &quot;Diodon&quot; aided in the training of Canadian naval air and surface forces out of Esquimalt, British Columbia, from October to December 1952. It returned to the Far East from March to September 1954, again conducting a surveillance patrol in La Perouse Straits from 24 May to 22 June. During its west coast training operations in the next two years, &quot;Diodon&quot; again operated with the Canadian Navy, and in March 1956 admitted visitors by means of a submarine escape bell while 130 feet (40 m) below the surface during rescue drills.

During its 1956–1957 tour of duty in the Far East, &quot;Diodon&quot; visited Brisbane, Australia, for the celebration commemorating the World War II Allied victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942. It served again in the Far East in 1958–1959 and 1960.

&quot;Diodon&quot; was decommissioned on 15 January 1971 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. It was sold for scrapping on 12 May 1972.

<text>Jason Thompson (born on November 22, 1981, in Garland, Texas) is an American soccer player who last played striker for D.C. United of Major League Soccer.

Thompson played college soccer at Eastern Illinois University from 2000 to 2002. Thompson had a very strong start in his freshman year, surprising everybody by scoring 21 goals to lead the NCAA Division I, and was named the Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year and chosen for Soccer America&#x27;s All-Freshman team. Thompson&#x27;s next year was mediocre, due to injuries, as he scored only five goals. Thompson did significantly better in 2002, however, finishing the year with 14 goals and four assists, earning him a first-team All-Midwest selection. Because of his performances for the Under-23 United States Men&#x27;s National Soccer Team, Thompson was offered a Nike Project-40 contract after his junior season, which he accepted.

As well as still holding the school record for the most goals scored in a single season (21 goals in 2000), Thompson is also the record holder for most goals scored in a single game, when he scored six in a 2002 match up with the Belmont Bruins.

Thompson was selected 15th overall, in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by his hometown Dallas Burn. Unfortunately, Thompson tore his ACL during the preseason while playing with the U-23 team, and missed all of the 2003 season. On returning in 2004, Thompson had trouble breaking into new coach Colin Clarke&#x27;s veteran-dominated lineup and was traded to D.C. United. Competition among forwards was equally strong at D.C., however, and although Thompson played a target forward role unlike United&#x27;s other strikers, he only made one appearance for the team, coming on as a substitute and played 60 minutes. D.C. United went on to win the 2004 MLS Cup with a 3–2 victory over Kansas City Wizards, at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. Thompson went on to play the entire 2005 season with D.C. United, one that saw United finish second in the Eastern Conference, before he was released into the waiver draft of that subsequent off-season.

Thompson completed his Doctor of Medicine at The University of Texas School of Medicine at San Antonio. He is currently an Orthopedic Surgery Resident at The University of Texas School of Medicine at San Antonio.

Once Thompson completed his residency in San Antonio he completed an additional year of fellowship in Canada focusing on orthopedic joints. There he specifically focused on the most complex hips and knee cases in North America. Now, Dr. Thompson is practicing orthopedics in Corpus Christi, TX with South Texas Bone and Joint where he has quickly become one of the busiest, leading and most well respected orthopedic joint doctors in South Texas.

<doc id="1157183" wikidata="Q6389431" url="?curid=1157183" title="Kenley">
<text>Kenley is a suburb within the London Borough of Croydon. It is located south of Charing Cross and within the southern boundary of London, England. Surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt on three sides, it includes the large open spaces of Kenley Common and Kenley Aerodrome. Kenley was part of the ancient parish of Coulsdon in the county of Surrey and was connected to central London by rail in 1856. As the population of the area was growing, it became part of Coulsdon and Purley Urban District in 1915 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. At the 2011 Census, Kenley had a population of 14,966.

==History==
===Local government===
Kenley was a hamlet in the ancient parish Coulsdon in the county of Surrey. In 1894 the Coulsdon parish became part of Croydon Rural District. Responding to the increase in population in the area, the rural district was broken up in 1915 and the parish of Coulsdon became part of Coulsdon and Purley Urban District. Coulsdon and Purley was incorporated into Greater London in 1965 and became part of the London Borough of Croydon.

===Suburban development===
For centuries, Kenley was part of Coulsdon Manor which covered the whole area now known as Coulsdon, Old Coulsdon, Purley and Kenley. As with most of this area, Kenley was primarily farm land, with a few big houses and their estates.

The official opening of the railway on 4 August 1856 transformed Kenley. The new railway prompted urban development. By the end of the Victorian era, Kenley had assumed its own identity. Magnificent gentlemen&#x27;s houses in substantial grounds were constructed during the 1860s. These houses gave Kenley its distinctive appearance on its western hillside. More modest housing and shops were built along the Godstone Road in the 1880s. Finally, the compact housing of the lower lying Roke area was constructed toward the end of the 19th century.

All Saints&#x27; Church, now a Grade II listed building, was built in 1870, and enlarged in 1897 and 1902. In 1888, Kenley was created as a parish in its own right.

One of Kenley&#x27;s landmark buildings is the Memorial Hall. It was opened in 1922 to commemorate those who gave their lives in the First World War. It was subsequently extended and re-opened by Group Captain Douglas Bader in 1975.

===Second World War===
RAF Kenley was a strategic airfield in the Battle of Britain. Given RAF Kenley&#x27;s importance, the Luftwaffe attempted to destroy it by means of a massive bombing raid on 18 August 1940. The attacking Luftwaffe aircraft suffered heavy casualties during the raid. Despite some damage to the airfield and the surrounding buildings and homes, this bombing raid proved unsuccessful. By the following day, RAF Kenley was operational again.

Kenley airfield plays a unique and important role in Britain’s history. As the UK’s most complete surviving Battle of Britain fighter airfield, it gives us a direct and tangible link to our aviation past. As an active airfield today, it builds on that heritage, whilst the surrounding environs provide visitors with a site of nature conservation and a protected public open space. The National Lottery funded Kenley Revival Project enables people to connect with, and take ownership of, a vital part of British history.

Hammond Innes&#x27; book &quot;Attack Alarm&quot; was based on his experiences as a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft gunner at RAF Kenley during the Battle of Britain. It contains graphic descriptions of the station and attacks on it in 1940.

===Post-war development===
In the post-war period, many of the substantial Victorian properties with their extensive grounds were developed for executive housing. In 1959, Kenley was closed as an operational base of the RAF. Today, the aerodrome is used exclusively by the gliders of the Air Training Corps (615 Volunteer Gliding Squadron) and the Surrey Hills Gliding Club.

==Geography==
Kenley is located south of Charing Cross and adjacent to the Greater London boundary. It is situated south of Purley, east of Coulsdon and west of Sanderstead. It is almost completely surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt, forming part of a finger of urban development that extends into Surrey to include Caterham and Whyteleafe to the south. The south of the area is dominated by the open green spaces of Kenley Common and Kenley Aerodrome.

==Kenley Common==
Kenley Common comprises 138 acres of green open space surrounding the former Battle of Britain airfield. It is a mixture of chalk grassland and ancient woodland set among gently rolling hills. Blessed with fine views across the Caterham valley and the North Downs beyond, visitors find it hard to believe that the centre of London is only 14 miles to the north.

The original common was bought by the Corporation of London in 1883. At that time, it encompassed some of the area that is now Kenley Airfield. Over the years, compulsory purchases by the Government and subsequent land acquisitions and re-acquisitions have meant that the Common has changed its shape and position, and almost doubled in size.

The common’s history as an airfield goes back to the First World War when planes were assembled and tested for squadrons in France. It proved an important link in the chain of supply and became established as a permanent Royal Air Force station. The Second World War saw concrete runways being laid and, as headquarters of ‘B’ Sector in the No 11 Group of fighter stations, it was soon playing a key role in the Battle of Britain. Kenley is now the last remaining Battle of Britain fighter station in the southeast to remain in its Second World War form. Evidence of its wartime role has survived and the old blast bays, air raid shelters, officer’s mess and the original runways can still be seen. English Heritage identified Kenley as the &quot;most complete fighter airfield associated with the Battle of Britain to have survived&quot;.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census, Kenley was White or White British (76.6%), Asian or Asian British (9.7%), Black or Black British (6.8%), Mixed/multiple ethnic groups (4.8%), and Other ethnic group (1.2%). The largest single ethnicity is White British (70.3%).

The largest religious groupings are Christians (59.8%), followed by those of no religion (23.4%), no response (7.7%), Hindus (3.8%), Muslims (3.4%), Buddhists (0.7%), other (0.4%), Jews (0.2%) and Sikhs (0.1%).

==Politics==
Kenley is located within the parliamentary constituency of Croydon South. The incumbent MP is Chris Philp of the Conservative Party, who was re-elected with 19,757 votes in the 2024 general election.

At a local level, Kenley has two Conservative councillors on Croydon Borough Council.






Boundary changes at the 2018 Local Elections saw the number of Councillors reduced from three to two.

<doc id="1157189" wikidata="Q5757835" url="?curid=1157189" title="Highbridge, Bronx">
<text>Highbridge is a residential neighborhood geographically located in the central-west section of the Bronx, New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the north, Jerome Avenue to the east, Macombs Dam Bridge to the south, and the Harlem River to the west. Ogden Avenue is the primary thoroughfare through Highbridge.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 4, and its ZIP Code is 10452. The local subway is the IND Concourse Line (), operating along the Grand Concourse, and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (), operating along Jerome Avenue. The area is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 44th Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx.

==History==
At the time of European settlement, the southern Bronx was inhabited by the Siwanoy, a tribe of the Wappinger confederacy. They called the hill that is now Highbridge &quot;Nuasin&quot;, or &quot;the land between&quot;, for its location between the Harlem River and an estuary that formerly flowed in the area of modern-day Jerome Avenue.

The neighborhood takes its name from the High Bridge, built in 1848 by Irish immigrants. The structure originally carried Croton Aqueduct water across the Harlem River. In 1864, a walkway was built across the High Bridge. Use of the structure to deliver water to Manhattan ceased in 1949. The bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic in the early 1960s, and allowed to fall into disrepair; in 2015 a reconstruction project was undertaken and completed with the opening of the bridge in 2019.

In the mid-late 19th century, the area was developed as a suburban retreat for the elite, who built large homes overlooking the Harlem River. The names of these families and their estates are reflected in the names of Highbridge&#x27;s north-south avenues: Ogden Avenue and Boscobel Place for William B. Ogden, Merriam Avenue for Francis W. Merriam, Anderson Avenue and Woodycrest Avenue for the Anderson family, and Shakespeare Avenue for the Shakespeare Garden on the Marcher family estate. Around the turn of the 20th century, many of these estates were subdivided for urban development, however a few older houses still remain.

In the early 20th century, the neighborhood was served by the Anderson–Jerome Avenues station, which connected the New York City Subway&#x27;s Ninth Avenue elevated Line with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line ().

In the late 1960s, the residents of Highbridge were predominantly of Irish, Italian and Eastern European Jewish descent. They have since been replaced by large numbers of Hispanics and African Americans. As of 2017, the neighborhood is undergoing gentrification.

==Demographics==
Prior to the 1960s, Highbridge was a predominantly Irish American neighborhood. Today the vast majority of residents in the area are of Dominican, Puerto Rican and African American descent. Almost 40% of families live below the federal poverty line.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Highbridge was 37,727, an increase of 3,883 (11.5%) from the 33,844 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

In 2010, the racial makeup of the neighborhood was 32.9% (12,397) African American, 1.2% (462) White, 0.2% (69) Native American, 0.5% (176) Asian, 0.0% (2) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (103) from other races, and 0.7% (253) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 64.3% (24,265) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 4, which comprises Highbridge and Concourse, had 155,835 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 78.6 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 27% are between the ages of between 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 23% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 10% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 4 was $30,900. In 2018, an estimated 32% of Highbridge and Concourse residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (13%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 61% in Highbridge and Concourse, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Highbridge and Concourse are considered low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. However, , rents in Highbridge have risen more than any other neighborhood in New York City, at a rate of 22%.

==Land use and terrain==

Highbridge is dominated by townhouses and 5 and 6-story apartment buildings, including numerous Art Deco landmarks built by the developer Bernard J. Noonan and the architects Horace Ginsberg and Marvin Fine. Many older detached mansions still remain on Woodycrest Avenue and Ogden Avenue. The total land area is roughly one square mile. The terrain is elevated and very hilly.

Stair streets connect the parts of the neighborhood that are located at different elevations. One particular stair street between Shakespeare and Anderson Avenues became known as the &quot;Joker Stairs&quot;, drawing tourists after the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot; was filmed there.

===Landmarks===

*The Woodycrest Children&#x27;s Home on Woodycrest Avenue was built as an orphanage by the American Female Guardian Society and Home for the Friendless &quot;to rescue from degradation, physical and moral, the children of want, homelessness and sorrow.&quot; This grand Beaux Arts building was designed by William Tuthill, the architect of Carnegie Hall.

<text>McVitie&#x27;s () is a British snack food brand owned by United Biscuits. The name is derived from the original Scottish biscuit maker, McVitie &amp; Price, [[Private company limited by shares|Ltd]]., established in 1830 on Rose Street in Edinburgh, Scotland. The company moved to various sites in the city before completing the St. Andrews Biscuit Works factory on Robertson Avenue in the Gorgie district in 1888.

The company also established one in Glasgow and two large manufacturing plants south of the border, in Heaton Chapel, Stockport, and Park Royal, London. There are five McVitie&#x27;s factories in the UK, with each producing a different types of biscuit; the Harlesden site in north-west London manufactures the chocolate digestives. Under United Biscuits McVitie&#x27;s held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II. The best-selling biscuit manufacturer in the United Kingdom, McVitie&#x27;s produces Jaffa Cakes and popular biscuits such as chocolate digestives, Hobnobs, and Rich tea. In 2020, sales of McVitie&#x27;s biscuits in the UK were more than five times the next two competitors.

==History==
=== Early history; McVities, Guest and Co ===

Robert McVitie was born in Dumfries in 1809. He served an apprenticeship with a baker and in 1834 he moved to Edinburgh. He initially lived and worked at 130 Rose Street, just north of Princes Street in the New Town. In 1835, he moved to the adjacent building at 129 Rose Street. It was called a &quot;provision Shop&quot;. In 1843, he opened a second shop at 14 Charlotte Place (later renamed Randolph Place) just west of Charlotte Square.

McVitie&#x27;s is first described as a &quot;baker and confectioner&quot; rather than a provision shop in 1856 at 5 Charlotte Place. He used the basement area below the shop as the bakery. By 1865, the bakery had moved to 47 London Street just round the corner from his flat at 76 Broughton Street. In 1870, McVitie is described as a baker at 12 Antigua Street and 2 East London Street, both also near his home in Broughton Street. In 1875, the business was expanded to 23 and 24 Queensferry Street where McVitie is described as a baker and confectioner. In 1881, his eldest son, also Robert (1854–1910), was in charge of the Queensferry Street business while the other properties remained in his name until 1884 although he died in 1883. In the same year Robert junior also occupied 8 and 9 Merchant Street. In 1887, he employed Alexander Grant from Forres, an experienced biscuit maker, to aid him. He was employed as foreman of the bakery but left to set up his own bakery in Inverness, Scotland but he failed and returned to McVitie&#x27;s.

In the late 19th century it was decided to split the operations of the business, with retail made a separate company. In 1898, McVitie rebranded the company as McVities, Guest and Co (usually McVities) after joining with his brother-in-law Edward Graham Guest. In 1903, they built the McVities Guest Tearoom at 135/136 Princes Street (on the corner of South Charlotte Street).

=== 1875–1947; McVitie &amp; Price ===
In 1875, the company had been joined by Charles Edward Price as a salesman. His success in this role led to a partnership in 1888 to create McVitie &amp; Price. In 1888, they built the huge St Andrews Biscuit Works on Robertson Avenue in the Gorgie district of south-west Edinburgh. Price left in 1910 following the death of Robert.
In 1891, the London salesman for the company George Andrews Brown persuaded the company to redesign their Rich Tea biscuit to a smaller size to accommodate the London taste. The original Gorgie factory burned down in 1894, but was rebuilt the same year to a much improved technical standard. It remained operative until 1969 when production ceased and operations were transferred to the English sites which had been established at Harlesden, north-west London in 1902 which is the largest biscuit factory in the UK, and Manchester in 1914.

Robert McVitie died married but childless in 1910 in Berkhamsted rather than at his home 12 Greenhill Gardens in south Edinburgh. He is commemorated in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. After his death, McVitie &amp; Price Limited was incorporated as a joint–stock limited company in 1911 placing Alexander Grant as managing director and principal share-holder. The firm acquired the Edinburgh bakery of Simon Henderson &amp; Sons in 1922.

===1948–2001; United Biscuits Group ===
McVitie &amp; Price merged with another Scottish bakery company, Macfarlane, Lang &amp; Co., Ltd, in 1948 to become United Biscuits Group. McVitie&#x27;s brand products are manufactured in five United Kingdom factories: the two former McVitie &amp; Price factories in Harlesden, England and Stockport, England; a former Macfarlane, Lang &amp; Co. factory named Victoria Biscuit Works in Glasgow; a former Carr&#x27;s factory named The Biscuit Works established 1831 in Carlisle, England; and the McVitie&#x27;s Cake Co. factory (formerly Riley&#x27;s Toffee Works) in Halifax, England.

McVitie &amp; Price&#x27;s first major biscuit was the McVitie&#x27;s digestive, created in 1892 by a new young employee at the company named Sir Alexander Grant. The biscuit was given its name because it was thought that its high baking soda content served as an aid to food digestion. Grant later became managing director of the company. In 1923, he was the main benefactor in establishing the National Library of Scotland giving an endowment of £100,000. Grant donated a further £100,000 in 1928 to assist with the building of the National Library premises on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh.

In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald, prime minister of Britain&#x27;s new Labour Government, admitted that Grant had given him a Daimler car and £30,000 of shares in McVitie&#x27;s. Grant had been MacDonald&#x27;s childhood friend, and shortly after received a baronetcy (hereditary knighthood) from the prime minister. The affair, regarded by many as corruption by the prime minister, severely shook the government.

The McVitie&#x27;s Chocolate Homewheat Digestive was created in 1925. Over 71 million packets of McVitie&#x27;s chocolate digestives are eaten in the United Kingdom each year, equating to 52 biscuits per second. Hobnobs were launched in 1985 and a milk chocolate variant followed in 1987. Launched in 1927, Jaffa Cakes were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the UK in 2012.

=== 2002–present; Recent history ===
Some of the products in the McVitie&#x27;s line were rebranded &quot;McV&quot; in 2002, but they were replaced in 2005 with a restyled version of the &quot;McVitie&#x27;s&quot; brand logo. In 2007, United Biscuits licensed the McVitie&#x27;s brand to Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd for biscuit production in Japan. In 2009, McVitie&#x27;s biscuits were voted as the most popular biscuits to dunk in tea, with McVitie&#x27;s chocolate digestives, Rich tea, and Hobnobs ranked the country&#x27;s top three favourite biscuits in 2009.

In June 2014, McVitie&#x27;s announced their intention to make 157 shop floor roles redundant at their Stockport manufacturing facility. This redundancy announcement was due to the modernisation agenda of the company and involved a move from an 8-hour 5-day operation to a 12-hour 7-day operation. In November 2014, United Biscuits and hence also McVitie&#x27;s were sold to Yildiz, a company in Istanbul, Turkey which in 2016 merged some of its subsidiaries including United Biscuits as Pladis.

In 2020, sales of McVitie&#x27;s biscuits in the United Kingdom were more than five times their closest two competitors in the biscuit category (Kit Kat and Cadbury biscuits). In 2022, McVitie&#x27;s ended 192 years of heritage and closed their last factory in Scotland, completely cutting ties with the brand&#x27;s Scottish roots. The same year, McVitie&#x27;s became the main sponsor of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. In 2023, McVitie&#x27;s struck a deal to sponsor English championship football club Hull City.

==Wedding cakes==

Although not their core operation it is noteworthy that McVitie&#x27;s were commissioned in 1893 to create a wedding cake for the royal wedding of the Duke of York and Princess Mary, who became King George V and Queen Mary. The cake was over 7 feet (2 metres) high and cost 140 guineas. It was viewed by 14,000 people and was wonderful publicity for the company. They received many commissions for royal wedding cakes and christening cakes.

In 1947, McVitie &amp; Price made the principal wedding cake for Princess Elizabeth (future Queen Elizabeth II) and Philip Mountbatten, which was served at the wedding breakfast. McVitie&#x27;s were commissioned to make a chocolate biscuit cake as a groom&#x27;s cake for the 2011 Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

<doc id="1157193" wikidata="Q115167" url="?curid=1157193" title="Jaffa orange">
<text>The Jaffa orange (Arabic: برتقال يافا, ), is an orange variety with few seeds and a tough skin that make it highly exportable. It was developed by Palestinian Arab farmers in mid-19th century Ottoman Palestine, and takes its name from the city of Jaffa where it was first produced for export.

During the initial Jewish immigration to Palestine, the business of maintaining orchards and exporting oranges was an integrated venture of Jews and Arabs based out of the Port of Jaffa. Today, the Jaffa orange is one of three main varieties of the fruit grown in the Mediterranean, alongside the navel and bitter orange. It is cultivated in Israel, Palestine, Cyprus, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Turkey.

== Characteristics ==

&quot;Jaffa&quot; oranges, also known as &quot;shamouti&quot;, are practically seedless, with a flavour that has been described as &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;sweet and fine&quot;. The two other main orange varieties cultivated in the region are the navel orange and the bitter orange; the latter is grown in Iran for its peel. The &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange is distinguished by its oval shape and thick peel, which is deep orange in colour and normally very easy to remove from the fruit. Its tough skin makes it &quot;especially suitable for export&quot;. As it produces very little juice and has a tendency towards delayed bitterness, it is unsuitable for juice production, although it does store well.

These oranges are very cold-tolerant, allowing them to grow outside of the subtropical regions normally associated with growing oranges. &quot;Jaffa&quot; oranges are susceptible to &quot;Alternaria&quot;, a type of fungus, and are prone to alternate bearing.

== History ==

Located at the crossroads between Africa, western Asia, and Europe, the Levant produced a number of commodities for export via imperial and global distribution networks throughout the late Ottoman period (1200–1900 CE). Among these were Nabulsi soap, sugar, barley, oranges, and cotton. Though cotton left its mark throughout the region, the only commodity that remains a symbol of production in Palestine is the &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange.

The &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange was a new variety developed by Arab farmers after emerging in the mid-19th century as a mutation on a tree of the &#x27;Baladi&#x27; variety near the city of Jaffa. While the sour orange (&quot;C. aurantium&quot;) was brought westward from China and India by local traders, who may have introduced it to Sicily and Spain, the &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange was developed from the sweet orange (&quot;C. sinensis&quot;) which was brought from China to the Mediterranean region by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.

After the Crimean War (1853–56), the most important innovation in local agriculture was the rapid expansion of citrus cultivation. Foremost among the varieties cultivated was the Jaffa (Shamouti) orange, and mention of it being exported to Europe first appears in British consular reports in the 1850s. One factor cited in the growth of the export market was the development of steamships in the first half of the 19th century, which enabled the export of oranges to the European markets in days rather than weeks. Another reason cited for the growth of the industry was the relative lack of European control over the cultivation of oranges compared to cotton, formerly a primary commodity crop of Palestine, but outpaced by the Jaffa orange.

Exports grew from 200,000 oranges in 1845 to 38 million oranges by 1870. The citrus plantations of this time were primarily owned by wealthy Palestinian merchants and notables, rather than small farmers, as the fruits required large capital investments with no yield for several years. Fruits carrying the &quot;Jaffa&quot; label were first marketed in 1870 by a German Templer colony. An 1872 account of Jaffa by a European traveller notes that &quot;Surrounding Jaffa are the orange gardens for which it is justly extolled, and which are a considerable source of wealth to the owners. The annual value of fruits grown in Jaffa was said to be 10,000 pounds.&quot; In the 1880s, an American grower, H.S. Sanford, tried to cultivate the &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange in Florida.
The prosperity of the orange industry brought increased European interest and involvement in the development of &quot;Jaffa&quot;. In 1902, a study of the growth of the orange industry by officials outlined the different owners and their primary export markets as England, Turkey, Egypt and Austria-Hungary. While the traditional Arabic cultivation methods were considered &quot;primitive,&quot; an in-depth study of the financial expenditure involved reveals that they were ultimately more cost-efficient than the Zionist-Jewish enterprises that followed them some two decades later..

Jewish immigrants to the area, from 1917 called the British Mandate Palestine, introduced the advanced cultivation methods that spurred the &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange industry. According to the Hope Simpson Enquiry of 1930,&quot;The cultivation of the orange, introduced by the Arabs before the commencement of Jewish settlement, has developed to a very great extent in consequence of that settlement. There is no doubt that the pitch of perfection to which the technique of plantation and cultivation of the orange and grapefruit have been brought in Palestine is due to the scientific methods of the Jewish agriculturist.&quot;
Partnerships in growing and exporting these oranges were an example of Arab-Jewish cooperation despite rising political tensions.

By the end of 1928, Jews had acquired 30,000 dunams of the region&#x27;s 60,000 dunams of orange orchards. Whereas before World War I, the price of a dunam of land in a fruitful orange grove was 50-75 pounds sterling, by 1929, the same groves were selling for 150-200 pounds sterling. In 1933, Jewish-owned orange production overtook Arab-owned orange production. By 1939, Jewish-owned and Arab-owned orange orchards in Palestine covered , employed over 100,000 workers, and their produce was a primary export. During World War II (1939–1945) citrus-growing declined, and Arab-owned orange production overtook Jewish-owned production.

After the 1948 war, the orange-growing industry was presented as a &quot;pioneering Labor-movement project&quot; which was &quot;void of any Arab presence&quot;. Significant ethnic cleansing of Palestinians Arabs by Jewish Zionists occurred following the Nakba between 1947-48, and the establishment of the Israeli State in 1948. Therefore many remaining Palestinian Arab orange farms were stolen from their owners by elements of the Israel State. 

==Legacy==
Jaffa oranges are harvested in the Israel and the Palestinian territories between November and March, with the marketing season beginning in September and extending through April. More than half the annual crop is exported, and Israel is the main provider of other citrus fruits to the European Union. In the 1950s and 1960s, Jaffa oranges became emblems of the Israeli state. A general decline in the importance of agriculture to the Israeli economy, extreme limits on available water resources, and the reliance on migrant laborers have reduced productivity. Overshadowed by manufacturing industries, such as diamonds and precision instruments, Israel nonetheless continues to export a large number of citrus fruits to Europe.

The &quot;Jaffa&quot; orange is also known for lending the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo the nickname &quot;Big Orange&quot;.

The orange is also a symbol for Palestinians; The Land of Sad Oranges (Arabic: أرض البرتقال الحزين) is the title of a famous story by Palestinian journalist and writer Ghassan Kanafani, that explores the Nakba through the eyes of a young child who lived and grew up in an orange grove in Palestine. The orange is utilized as a strong symbol for the Palestinians&#x27; connection with their lands and the immense losses they suffered.

<text>Route 8 () of Hong Kong is a dual 3-lane carriageway motorway that links Lantau Island, Tsing Yi Island, Cheung Sha Wan in West Kowloon, and Sha Tin in the southeast New Territories of Hong Kong. It is a combination of many sections.

The section from Lantau to Tsing Yi is made up of the existing North Lantau Highway and Lantau Link, which opened in 1997. Route 8 becomes Airport Road at Chek Lap Kok.

The section between Tsing Yi and Cheung Sha Wan, formerly known as Route 9, is a dual 3-lane expressway. This section consists of the Stonecutters Bridge, which spans the Rambler Channel from Stonecutters Island and links with the Lantau Link through the Nam Wan Tunnel and West Tsing Yi viaduct and was opened on 20 December 2009. This section provides traffic with a more direct route to the Lantau Link, particularly vehicles from Tsim Sha Tsui and Western Harbour Crossing, previously vehicles had to use Route 3 (Cheung Tsing Bridge and Cheung Tsing Tunnel).

The remaining section links Cheung Sha Wan and Tai Wai, formerly known as Route 16. It is composed of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, totalling in length and connecting Route 9 at its Sha Tin terminus. It was opened on 21 March 2008.

Areas passed through by Route 8 include Hong Kong International Airport, Tung Chung, Hong Kong Disneyland, Ma Wan, Tsing Yi, West Kowloon, and Sha Tin.

Route 8 also connects with Route 3, Route 7, and Route 9.

== History ==
The current Route 8 section was planned in 1990, in line with the Airport Core Programme. The section from Chek Lap Kok to Tsing Yi is called Route 9; the section from Tsing Yi to Sha Tin is called Route 16. The former was opened to traffic on 22 May 1997, including North Lantau Highway, Kap Shui Mun Bridge and Tsing Ma Bridge.

In November 2002, the construction of Route 16 (now Route 8 from Tsing Yi section to Sha Tin section) began. On 31 January 2004, according to the Third generation of Route number system, Route 9 and Route 16 were merged into Route 8. Among them, the Nam Wan Tunnel was completed as early as 25 February 2005, but it was opened to traffic only in 2009 after the completion of the Stonecutters Bridge; until then traffic would have to use Route 3 (including the Cheung Tsing Highway, Cheung Tsing Tunnel and Cheung Tsing Bridge) which linked the two discontinuous segments of Route 8.

In 2008, the section between Cheung Sha Wan and Sha Tin of Route 8 was completed and was named Tsing Sha Highway. The Community Chest held the New Territories Million Walk on this section on February 24. The Tsing Sha Highway was opened to traffic on March 21.

In 2009, the section between Cheung Sha Wan and Tsing Yi section of Route 8 was completed, and the Community Chest held a million trip on the Stonecutters Bridge and the Nam Wan Tunnel on 15 November. The remaining section of the Tsing Sha Highway was opened to traffic on 20 December, and the same day also marked the full completion of Route 8.

<text>In astronomy, a redshift survey is a survey of a section of the sky to measure the redshift of astronomical objects: usually galaxies, but sometimes other objects such as galaxy clusters or quasars. 
Using Hubble&#x27;s law, the redshift can be used to estimate the distance of an object from Earth. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure detailed statistical properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. In conjunction with observations of early structure in the cosmic microwave background, these results can place strong constraints on cosmological parameters such as the average matter density and the Hubble constant.

Generally the construction of a redshift survey involves two phases: first the selected area of the sky is imaged with a wide-field telescope, then galaxies brighter than a defined limit are selected from the resulting images as non-pointlike objects; optionally, colour selection may also be used to assist discrimination between stars and galaxies. Secondly, the selected galaxies are observed by spectroscopy, most commonly at visible wavelengths, to measure the wavelengths of prominent spectral lines; comparing observed and laboratory wavelengths then gives the redshift for each galaxy.

The Great Wall, a vast conglomeration of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.

The first systematic redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey of around 2,200 galaxies, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. This was later extended to the CfA2 redshift survey of 15,000 galaxies, completed in the early 1990s.

These early redshift surveys were limited in size by taking a spectrum for one galaxy at a time; from the 1990s, the development of fibre-optic spectrographs and multi-slit spectrographs enabled spectra for several hundred galaxies to be observed simultaneously, and much larger redshift surveys became feasible. Notable examples are the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (221,000 redshifts, completed 2002); the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (approximately 1 million redshifts by 2007) and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. At high redshift the largest current surveys are the DEEP2 Redshift Survey and the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS); these have around 50,000 redshifts each, and are mainly focused on galaxy evolution. 

ZFOURGE or the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey which aims to establish an observational benchmark of galaxy properties at redshift z &gt; 1. The survey is using near-infrared FOURSTAR instrument on the Magellan Telescopes, surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS.

Because of the demands on observing time required to obtain spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., redshifts determined directly from spectral features measured at high precision), a common alternative is to use photometric redshifts based on model fits to the brightnesses and colors of objects. Such &quot;photo-z&#x27;s&quot; can be used in large surveys to estimate the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars, provided the galaxy types and colors are well understood in a particular redshift range. At present, the errors on photometric redshift measurements are significantly higher than those of spectroscopic redshifts, but future surveys (for example, the LSST) aim to significantly refine the technique.

<doc id="1157203" wikidata="Q209773" url="?curid=1157203" title="Die, Drôme">
<text>Die (; ; ) is a commune, a former episcopal see, and a subprefecture of the Drôme department in southeastern France. The region around Die is known as the Diois (; ).

Die is perhaps best known for its sparkling wine &quot;Clairette de Die&quot;. It was a county in the High Middle Ages and was once the see of a Roman Catholic diocese with its church serving as a cathedral . Die is a charming town with several historic monuments encircled by Gallo-Roman city walls.

== Geography ==
Die is situated in the valley of the river Drôme, surrounded by the Glandasse mountain (6,696 feet; 2,041 m), a massive and steep rocky barrier, which separates the area (Pays Diois) from the Vercors Plateau. The territory of the commune of Die is part of the regional natural park.

== History ==
Habitation during the Neolithic age has been confirmed by the Chanqueyras excavations. A large engraved standing stone and two small menhirs that are now in the Die museum were found near the wine cooperative further proving habitation in this area at that time.

Late Bronze Age remains were discovered at La Roche De Marginal along with some similarly dated shards at Chandillon. A first settlement seems to have appeared at the beginning of the Roman era, on a small mountain pass alongside the Drôme, and the small valley of Meyrosse, at the crossroad between the valley itself the track to Trièves. There is much evidence of the extensive urbanisation during the 1st century.

At the beginning of the 2nd century, the town of Die saw the construction of monumental architecture and also replaced Luc-en-Diois as the Roman provincial capital for the Celtic people of northern Voconces. It achieved the formal status of a colony towards the end of the 2nd century or during the 3rd century as shown by the town becoming an important centre of worship for the fertility goddess Cybele’s

When the Roman Empire was showing signs of weakness, between the 285 and 305, a fortified wall was constructed around the town, protecting an urban area of , this wall is just over a mile long. Fragments of funerary monuments where included in its construction. Die had two main gates: to the west, the gate of Saint-Pierre (demolished in 1891) and to the east, the gate of Saint-Marcel. 
To go to Chichilliane, people would take the road near Grenoble, and cross the Glandasse mountain (south of Vercors). Rock was extracted from quarries on this plateau and brought to Die for use.

The first recorded bishop of the Ancient Diocese of Die was Nicaise in 325, the only Gallic church representative to attend the First Council of Nicaea. The diocese was later merged with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Valence in 1276, separated at the end of the 17th century and finally suppressed during the French Revolution.

=== Remains ===
The Die and Diois museum (Musée de Die) in the centre of town not only exhibits the multiple and imposing remains of the Roman era but also tells the story of the Diois during prehistory, its time as an episcopal city in the Middle-Ages and the devastation caused by religious wars.

== Population ==
== Economy == 
Apart from agriculturalists and wine producers, the economy is still composed of many SMEs including craftspeople tourism providers and local retailers. Die is also the economic and social centre of all the Diois with schools and professional and other training centres. Public and administrative services also care for the well-being of the town and the surrounding valley.

===Tourism===
The commune of Die has fewer than 5000 inhabitants. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city concentrated on small industries, such as furniture and shoes missed the opportunity to develop tourism.

By contrast, Die now receives a significant number of tourists during summer, from countries such as The Netherlands and Belgium who use the many camp sites around the Drôme valley. In winter, tourists come from the surrounding regions for winter sports at the Col du Rousset ski station (located in the Vercors Mountains). The most popular activities are: skiing (France&#x27;s Handisport Ski Championship), snowshoe hiking, sled dog racing (International competition of Alpirush). In 1992 it hosted the International Mountain Race Competition which was won by a Colombian.

===Agriculture===
The cooperative winery Clairette de Die is the biggest Diois employer, had the idea a few years ago to adopt the brand name “jaillance” to increase competitiveness and brand recognition thus promoting its sales and exports.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Die is twinned with:

* Wirksworth, United Kingdom
* Varallo Sesia, Piedmont, Italy
* Frankenau, Germany 
* Kiskunfélegyháza, Bács-Kiskun, Hungary
* Dhouge, Senegal

<doc id="1157205" wikidata="Q16972355" url="?curid=1157205" title="1900 VFL season">
<text>The 1900 VFL season was the fourth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 5 May to 22 September, comprising a 14-round home-and-away season followed by a finals series featuring all eight clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by four points in the 1900 VFL grand final; it was Melbourne&#x27;s first VFL premiership. Fitzroy won its second consecutive minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with an 11–3 win–loss record. &#x27;s Teddy Lockwood and &#x27;s Albert Thurgood tied for the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkickers.

==Background==
In 1900, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds.

Once the 14 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1900 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the 1898 VFL finals system.

==Win–loss table==
The following table can be sorted from biggest winning margin to biggest losing margin for each round. If two or more matches in a round are decided by the same margin, these margins are sorted by percentage (i.e. the lowest-scoring winning team is ranked highest and the lowest-scoring losing team is ranked lowest). Opponents are listed above the margins and home matches are in bold. The rescheduling of round 3 until after round 14, which occurred following the cancellation of the originally scheduled matches due to heavy rain, is also reflected in this table.

By winning the minor premiership and accruing at least eight premiership points from its three sectional matches, Fitzroy won the right to challenge the semi-final winner for the premiership.

==Season notes==
*The Round 1 match between St Kilda and Melbourne ended in a draw, but the result was changed to a St Kilda victory on protest after it was noted that the umpire did not signal the end of the third quarter in the correct fashion after hearing the bell. This was St Kilda&#x27;s first-ever VFL win (after 48 losses), their first win since 1896 in the VFA (after 51 losses), and was the first of only two occasions that the score of a game has been changed on protest (the second was the 2006 AFL siren controversy between St Kilda and ). 
* St Kilda footballer Dave Strickland, the father of Shirley Strickland, won the 1900 Stawell Gift in 12 seconds off a handicap of 10 yards. 
* Collingwood&#x27;s highly talented &quot;loose cannon&quot; Dick Condon was given a lifetime suspension for sustained abuse of field umpire Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp.
* By the end of the finals round-robin matches, more than 1,000 points had been scored against St Kilda in a single season.
* Melbourne won the 1900 premiership despite having a 6–8 record after the home-and-away matches and finishing sixth of the eight teams on the ladder. This unsatisfactory situation led to the formation of the &quot;Argus&quot; Final Four system for 1901, which was modified in 1902 and 1907 and used until 1930 (except for 1924).

<text>Extase is a computer game developed by Cryo and published by Virgin Mastertronic.

==Summary==
&quot;Extase&quot; features some puzzles involving a sleeping female android that the player needed to wake up by cleaning its circuit. Each level represented a different level of emotion until the final &quot;extase&quot; (ecstasy). The gameplay mechanic is based on the &quot;Brain Bowler&quot; minigame in &quot;Purple Saturn Day&quot;, an &#x27;alien sports&#x27; compilation created by the Cryo team under the name ERE and published by Epyx.

The music was designed by Stéphane Picq, and was co-credited to Philippe Eidel, and The Bulgarian Voices. It punctuated each action of the player or each event, becoming gradually richer until the level was finally completed.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Ace Magazine&quot; wrote that the game was highly original, though noted it is one players would either love or hate. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; described the game as a &quot;musical masterpiece&quot; and &quot;graphic extravaganza&quot;.

<text>Rambahadur Limbu, (; 8 July 1939 – 22 April 2023) was a Nepalese Gurkha and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Rambahadur Limbu belonged to the Begha Clan of Limbu people of Nepal. Limbu was born in Chyangthapu village, Tehrathum, in East Nepal, and later lived in Damak.

==Military career==
===Victoria Cross===
In November 1965, Limbu was 26 years old, and was a lance corporal in the 2nd Battalion, 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, British Army during the Indonesian Confrontation. On 21 November in Sarawak, Borneo, Limbu was in an advance party of 16 Gurkhas when they encountered about 30 Indonesians holding a position on the top of a jungle-covered hill. Limbu went forward with two men, but when they were only ten yards from the enemy machine-gun position, the sentry opened fire on them, whereupon Limbu rushed forward and killed him with a grenade. The remaining enemy combatants then opened fire on the small party, wounding the two men with Limbu. Limbu then made three journeys into the open under heavy fire, two to drag his comrades to safety and one to retrieve their Bren gun, with which he charged down and killed many of the enemy.

====Citation====


The medal was presented by the Queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 1966. Limbu&#x27;s five-year-old son attended with his father.

His original Victoria Cross was stolen, along with all his other possessions, while he was asleep during a train journey in India to his native Nepal in 1967. It has never been found, and he was issued with a replacement.

===Later career===
Limbu reached the rank of captain, as a Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Officer (QGO), and was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1984 for his service as Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Orderly Officer. He then retired from active service in 1985.

==Death==
Limbu died from heart and kidney failure in Lalitpur on 22 April 2023, aged 83.

==In the media==
Limbu was interviewed for the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot; which also included archive footage and dramatisations of his actions.

<doc id="1157225" wikidata="Q360927" url="?curid=1157225" title="Irrfan Khan">
<text>Irrfan Khan () (born Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan; 7 January 196729 April 2020) was an Indian actor who worked in Indian cinema as well as British and American films. Widely regarded as one of the finest actors in world cinema, Khan&#x27;s career spanned over 30 years and earned him numerous accolades, including a National Film Award, an Asian Film Award, and six Filmfare Awards. In 2011, he was awarded the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian honour. In 2021, he was posthumously awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award.

Khan made his film debut with a small role in &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; (1988), which was followed by years of struggle. He acted in a few Film and Television Institute of India student films such as &quot;Reconnaissance&quot; (1990), which was directed by Sandeep Chattopadhyay. After starring in the British film &quot;The Warrior&quot; (2001), he had his breakthrough with starring roles in the dramas &quot;Haasil&quot; (2003) and &quot;Maqbool&quot; (2004). He went on to gain critical acclaim for his roles in &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2006) for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male, &quot;Life in a... Metro&quot; (2007), and &quot;Paan Singh Tomar&quot; (2011). For portraying the title character in the last of these, he won the National Film Award for Best Actor. Further success came for his starring roles in &quot;The Lunchbox&quot; (2013), &quot;Piku&quot; (2015), and &quot;Talvar&quot; (2015) and he had supporting roles in the Hollywood films &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012), &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012), &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015), and &quot;Inferno&quot; (2016). His other notable roles were in &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), &quot;New York&quot; (2009), &quot;Haider&quot; (2014), and &quot;Gunday&quot; (2014), and the television series &quot;In Treatment&quot; (2010). His highest-grossing Hindi film release came with the comedy-drama &quot;Hindi Medium&quot; (2017), and his final film appearance was in its sequel &quot;Angrezi Medium&quot; (2020), both of which won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 2018 and 2021.

As of 2017, his films had grossed () at the worldwide box office. Khan was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer in March 2018, and died from the disease on 29 April 2020. Khan was described by Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a distinguished and charismatic star in Hindi and English-language movies whose hardworking career was an enormously valuable bridge between South Asian and Hollywood cinema&quot;. He was honoured in the &#x27;In memoriam&#x27; segment of the 93rd Academy Awards.

==Early life and education==
Khan was born on 7 January 1967 in Tonk, Rajasthan. Khan&#x27;s mother, Saeeda Begum Khan was from Tonk, and his father, Yaseen Ali Khan, was from the Khajuriya village in Rajasthan&#x27;s Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business. He spent his childhood in Tonk, and then Jaipur. Irrfan was good at cricket and was selected to play in the CK Nayudu Trophy for emerging players in the under-23 category, a tournament seen as a stepping stone to first-class cricket in India. However, he did not attend as he could not afford travel expenses.

He showed interest in acting under the influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre artist in Jodhpur. In Jaipur, Khan was introduced to noted theatre artists and did several stage performances in the city. Khan completed his MA in Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984 to study acting.

In his early days in Mumbai, he took up a job as an air conditioner repairman and visited the home of his acting inspiration, Rajesh Khanna, in 1984. Later in an interview Irfan stated, &quot;The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I&#x27;d say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career (1987–1990)===
Soon after his graduation from NSD in 1987, Khan made his debut with Mira Nair&#x27;s &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; where he was offered a minor role. However, his scenes were reduced in the final cut. He played Lenin in a teleplay on Doordarshan titled &quot;Laal Ghaas Par Neele Ghode&quot;, based on a translation by Uday Prakash of a Russian play by Mikhail Shatrov. He was then cast as a psycho killer, the main antagonist of the show, in the serial &quot;Darr&quot;. He also played the famous revolutionary, Urdu poet and Marxist political activist of India, Makhdoom Mohiuddin, in &quot;Kahkashan&quot;, produced by Ali Sardar Jafri. He acted in some of the episodes of &quot;Star Bestsellers&quot; (aired on Star-Plus). He also appeared in two episodes of the SET India serial &quot;Bhanvar&quot;. He acted in numerous television serials throughout the 1990s, including &quot;Chanakya&quot;, &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;, &quot;Sara Jahan Hamara&quot;, &quot;Banegi Apni Baat&quot;, &quot;Chandrakanta&quot;, &quot;Shrikant&quot;, &quot;AnooGoonj&quot; on Doordarshan, &quot;Star Bestsellers&quot; (Star Plus), &quot;Sparsh&quot; and The Great Maratha on DD National. He also played a double role in the popular 90s supernatural fantasy period drama, Chandrakanta, which was based on a novel written by Devki Nandan Khatri in 1888.

===Television work and film career (1990–2008)===
He featured opposite Roopa Ganguly in Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s critically acclaimed drama film &quot;Kamla Ki Maut&quot; (1989). In the 1990s, he appeared in the critically acclaimed films &quot;Ek Doctor Ki Maut&quot; (1990), and &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot; (1998), as well as various other films, which went unnoticed. In 1998, he played Valmiki in Sanjay Khan&#x27;s serial &quot;Jai Hanuman&quot;. He also did an episode named &#x27;From Reel to Real&#x27; in horror television show Ssshhhh...Koi Hai in 2001.
Asif Kapadia cast him as the lead in &quot;The Warrior&quot;, a historical film completed in 11 weeks on location in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. In 2001, &quot;The Warrior&quot; opened at international film festivals.

Between 2003 and 2004, he acted in Ashvin Kumar&#x27;s short film, &quot;Road to Ladakh&quot;; the film received rave reviews at international festivals. That same year, he played the title role in the critically acclaimed &quot;Maqbool&quot;, an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

His first Bollywood lead role came in 2005 with &quot;Rog&quot;. His performance was praised by critics; one wrote, &quot;Irfaan&#x27;s eyes speak louder than his words and every time he is in frame, be it talking to his buddy Manish or arguing with Suhel, he shows his capability as an actor&quot;. Thereafter, he appeared in several films either playing the leading role or a supporting role as a villain. In 2004, he won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role in &quot;Haasil&quot;. He also played an antagonist in the Telugu film &quot;Sainikudu&quot;.

In 2007, he appeared in the box office hits &quot;The Namesake&quot; and &quot;Life in a... Metro&quot;. His chemistry with Konkana Sen was one of the highlights of the latter; it also won him the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. These roles were closely followed by his appearances in the international films, &quot;A Mighty Heart&quot; and &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;. Despite his success in Bollywood, he continued to work on television. He anchored &quot;Mano Ya Na Mano&quot; (airing on STAR One), and hosted &quot;Kyaa Kahein&quot;.

===International success (2008–2020)===
Khan played a police inspector in the 2008 film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, for which he and the cast of the movie won Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. About him, Danny Boyle said, &quot;he has an instinctive way of finding the &#x27;moral centre&#x27; of any character, so that in &quot;Slumdog&quot;, we believe the policeman might actually conclude that Jamal is innocent.&quot; Boyle compared him to an athlete who can execute the same move perfectly over and over. &quot;It&#x27;s beautiful to watch.&quot;

In 2009, he featured in the film &quot;Acid Factory&quot;. He appeared as an FBI agent in &quot;New York&quot; (2009), and opposite Natalie Portman as a Gujarati diamond merchant in the Mira Nair-directed segment of the twelve-part feature &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;. In 2010, he worked on the third season of the HBO series &quot;In Treatment&quot;, enacting the part of Sunil, who is finding it difficult to come to terms with his wife&#x27;s death and loneliness after moving to the New York City borough of Brooklyn.

Khan played Dr. Rajit Ratha in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in 2012. He played the adult version of Piscine &quot;Pi&quot; Molitor Patel in Ang Lee&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, which became a critical and commercial success worldwide. His lead role in &quot;Paan Singh Tomar&quot; (2012), as the eponymous real-life athlete turned dacoit, won him the National Film Award for Best Actor. In 2013, he starred in &quot;The Lunchbox&quot;, which won the Grand Rail d&#x27;Or at Cannes Film Festival and received a BAFTA nomination, and became his highest-grossing Hindi film to date.

In 2014, Khan appeared in &quot;Gunday&quot;, which was a moderate box office success. He also made guest appearances in the films &quot;The Xposé&quot; and &quot;Haider&quot;, playing an important role in the latter. In 2015, he played the lead role in the film &quot;Piku&quot; alongside Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan. Khan co-starred in the 2015 film &quot;Jurassic World&quot;. In the same year, he also appeared in the acclaimed thriller &quot;Talvar&quot; in which his performance was praised. He appeared in &quot;Jazbaa&quot; in October 2015 alongside Aishwarya Rai which was very well received by critics. He was next seen alongside Tom Hanks in the 2016 adaptation of Dan Brown&#x27;s Robert Langdon thriller &quot;Inferno&quot;. That same year, he also starred in &quot;Madaari&quot;, a 2016 Indian social thriller film directed by Nishikant Kamat.

In 2017, Khan appeared in two films, &quot;Hindi Medium&quot; which was commercially and critically successful. Khan&#x27;s portrayal as Raj Batra in &quot;Hindi Medium&quot; earned him several accolades, one of which was the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. &quot;Hindi Medium&quot; became a sleeper hit in India and China, becoming his highest-grossing Hindi release, surpassing &quot;The Lunchbox&quot;. He also starred in &quot;No Bed of Roses&quot; (2017). As of 2017, his films had grossed () at the worldwide box office. His next release was &quot;Qarib Qarib Singlle&quot; opposite Parvathy Thiruvothu, who was making her debut in Hindi cinema.

In 2018, Khan appeared in &quot;Karwaan&quot;, with Dulquer Salmaan, Mithila Palkar and Kriti Kharbanda. He also appeared in &quot;Blackmail&quot; opposite Kirti Kulhari, the same year. His Hollywood film &quot;Puzzle&quot; also released in 2018.

Khan&#x27;s final film appearance was in &quot;Angrezi Medium&quot;, directed by Homi Adajania, which was released on 13 March 2020.

==Other work==
In September 2015, he was appointed the brand ambassador for &quot;Resurgent Rajasthan&quot;, a campaign by the state government of Rajasthan. He lent his voice to the light and sound show at the war memorial for the Indian army at Vidhan Sabha Road, Jaipur. The show portrayed the valour and courage of Rajasthani soldiers, and their historic and modern triumphs in battle.

==Personal life==
On 23 February 1995, Khan married writer and fellow NSD graduate Sutapa Sikdar. They had two sons, Babil and Ayan.

In 2012, he changed the spelling of his first name from &quot;Irfan&quot; to &quot;Irrfan&quot;; he said he liked the sound of the extra &quot;r&quot; in his name. He later dropped &quot;Khan&quot; from his name because according to a 2016 interview, he wanted his work and not his lineage to define him.

==Death==
In March 2018, he revealed via Twitter that he had been diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. He sought treatment in the UK for a year, and returned to India in February 2019. Khan was admitted to Mumbai&#x27;s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital on 28 April 2020, where he started receiving treatment for a colon infection caused by the disease, and died the next day, at 53 years old. His mother Saeeda Begum, aged 93, had died just four days prior in Jaipur.

Film personalities and literary figures around the globe paid tributes online upon the news of his death. Khan was buried at the Versova Kabristan in Mumbai and his last rites were performed by his sons.

<text>Sir Tasker Watkins (18 November 1918 – 9 September 2007) was a Welsh Lord Justice of Appeal and deputy Lord Chief Justice. He was President of the Welsh Rugby Union from 1993 to 2004. During the Second World War, he served in the British Army and was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest British award for valour in the face of the enemy. A war hero who was prominent in the law and in Rugby Union, Watkins was described as &quot;The Greatest Living Welshman&quot;.

==Early life==
Watkins was born in the small town of Nelson, Glamorgan, the son of Bertram Watkins, an engine fitter, and his wife Jane Watkins, née Phillips. He won a scholarship to Pontypridd Boys&#x27; Grammar School. In 1931 he moved with his parents to Dagenham in east London. He attended school in Romford where he captained the cricket and football teams and played rugby. After leaving school he worked for export agents and a halibut oil company and became a teacher in London.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Watkins joined the British Army, initially as a private in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry, in October. After serving for over a year as a private he was sent for officer training and was commissioned, with the rank of second lieutenant, into the Welch Regiment on 17 May 1941. He was given the service number 187088. He was posted to the regiment&#x27;s 1/5th Battalion, a Territorial Army (TA) unit. The battalion was one of three (the others being the 4th Welch Regiment and the 2nd Monmouthshire Regiment) which formed part of the 160th Infantry Brigade, itself being one of three brigades (the others being the 158th and 159th) forming the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. The division, then commanded by Major General Gerard Bucknall, was serving in Northern Ireland until moving to Wales late in 1941, and then to Kent in April 1942, where it remained for over two years before it saw action, until then being engaged in training and military exercises.

As a lieutenant, Watkins departed for France with the rest of the 53rd Division, commanded by Major General Robert Knox Ross, arriving in late June 1944, just weeks after the D-Day landings. The division participated in a number of engagements, such as the Second Battle of the Odon, and, in August, the battle of the Falaise Pocket. By mid-August Watkins, commanding &quot;B&quot; Company in his battalion, which had by now been transferred from the 160th Brigade to the 158th Brigade, was one officer in a group leading an assault on a German machine gun post. After the other officers were killed in the approach, Watkins continued to lead the group, leading a bayonet charge against 50 armed enemy infantry and then single-handedly taking out a machine-gun post to ensure the safety of his unit.

He was the first Welsh member of the British Army to be awarded a VC during the Second World War. His citation read:

Watkins&#x27; active service ended in October 1944 when he was badly wounded in the battle to liberate the Dutch city of &#x27;sHertogenbosch, where a memorial service was held for him in St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in 2007. He rarely spoke about the war. Of the event which led to him being awarded the VC he simply stated, in a 1955 radio interview:

He stated in another interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2001:

Wales rugby coach Graham Henry had Watkins&#x27; citation pinned up on the wall of the Welsh changing room before Six Nations encounters.

Watkins&#x27; VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum.

==Career==
Watkins later achieved the rank of major, and on leaving the Army, studied law. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1948. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel on 27 April 1965, and in 1966–67 was Counsel to the Tribunal on the inquiry into the Aberfan disaster, which happened a few miles from his birthplace.

Watkins was deputy chairman of Radnorshire Quarter Sessions between 1962 and 1971, and of Carmarthenshire Quarter Sessions from 1966 until 1971. He was Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil between 1968 and 1970 and of Swansea during 1970 and 1971. He was Leader of the Wales and Chester Circuit from 1970 to 1971.

In 1971, he was appointed to the High Court bench, where he sat in the Family Division between 1971 and 1974, and thereafter, until 1980, in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division. He was a Presiding Judge of the Wales and Chester Circuit from 1975 until he was promoted to the Court of Appeal (receiving the customary appointment to the Privy Council) in 1980. He became the first Senior Presiding Judge in 1983. Lord Lane appointed him Deputy Chief Justice in 1988, a post which he continued to hold under Lane&#x27;s successor as Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, until retiring from the bench in 1993.

Watkins was a chairman of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, Wales Region, between 1960 and 1971 and was also chairman of the Judicial Studies Board during 1979 and 1980.

===Welsh Rugby Union===
Watkins played Rugby Union football as an outside-half for the Army, Cardiff RFC and Glamorgan Wanderers. He became president of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1993, overseeing the switch from the amateur era to professionalism and the move from club to regional rugby in Wales. He stepped down on 26 September 2004 as the first man since Sir David Rocyn Jones in 1953 to hold office for more than one season. His 11 years of service made him the second longest serving president in the WRU&#x27;s 123-year history.

Watkins was also chairman, President of Glamorgan Wanderers, and patron until his death. Watkins is now honoured by Glamorgan Wanderers as their First XV team shirt has the letters STW-VC (Sir Tasker Watkins VC) in a green box on the right shoulder. The Wanderers also have a working model statue of Watkins in their club house donated by Llantwit Major based sculptor Roger Andrews. It stands in a corner that has been called &#x27;Tasker&#x27;s Corner&#x27; by members of the club. Watkins has been called &quot;The most influential Welshman of the late 20th century.&quot;

Watkins was appointed an honorary life vice-patron of the WRU. On announcement of his death, the Welsh team wore black armbands for their 2007 Rugby World Cup game against Canada in Nantes, France, as a tribute to the former WRU president.

===Other interests===
Watkins was president of the University of Wales College of Medicine for 11 years from 1987, and was president of the British Legion in Wales from 1947 to 1968.

Watkins was once asked by the Liberal Party if he would consider becoming a Member of Parliament and a safe seat was offered him, but Watkins turned the offer down.

==Later life==
After falling at his home in Llandaff in August 2007, Watkins was hospitalised at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Watkins died at the hospital on 9 September 2007. His funeral was held at Llandaff Cathedral on 15 September, and he was later cremated at Thornhill Crematorium.

==Personal life==
Watkins married Eirwen Evans in 1941. They had a son and a daughter.

==Honours and decorations==

Watkins was knighted in 1971. He was made a member of the Privy Council in 1980. Appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1990 and Knight of Justice of the Order of St John (K.StJ) in 1998, on 12 April 2006 he was made a Freeman of the City of Cardiff, with Lord Mayor Freda Salway describing Watkins as &quot;one of Wales&#x27; most notable citizens.&quot;

His VC and other honours are on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1157234" wikidata="Q4409080" url="?curid=1157234" title="Jill Halfpenny">
<text>Jill Halfpenny (born 15 July 1975) is an English actress who first garnered attention playing Nicola Dobson in the coming-of-age BBC drama series &quot;Byker Grove&quot; (1989–1992). She became more widely known for her roles as Rebecca Hopkins on the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1999–2000), Kate Mitchell on the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2002–2005), and Izzie Redpath in &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (2006–2007). Her other notable credits include &quot;Babylon&quot; (2014), &quot;In the Club&quot; (2014–2016), &quot;Humans&quot; (2015), &quot;Three Girls&quot; (2017), &quot;Liar&quot; (2017–2020), &quot;Dark Money&quot; (2019), &quot;The Drowning&quot; (2021), and &quot;The Long Shadow&quot; (2023). She won the second series of the television dance contest &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2004.

For her portrayal of Paulette Bonafonté in the original West End run of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2010–2011), Halfpenny received the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical. Her other stage credits include &quot;Chicago&quot; (West End, 2005), &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; (West End, 2009), &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; (West End, 2012), &quot;Way Upstream&quot; (Chichester Festival Theatre, 2015), &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot; (Leeds Playhouse, 2018), and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (Royal Exchange, 2024).

==Career==
=== 1989–2004: Television debut, soap roles, and &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; ===
Halfpenny began her professional career in 1989 when she joined the cast of the Newcastle-based children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, playing the part of Nicola Dobson until 1992. Following guest star appearances on shows such as &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, and &quot;Peak Practice&quot;, she landed the part of staff nurse Rebecca Hopkins on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;; a role she played between 1999 and 2000. The character was involved in a high-profile affair storyline with Martin Platt, eventually leading to the breakdown of Platt&#x27;s marriage.

In December 2002, Halfpenny took on the role of Kate Mitchell on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The character—an undercover policewoman—was introduced as a honeytrap for Phil Mitchell, with the intent of coaxing him into a murder confession; her cover was eventually blown and, having fallen in love with him, she became Mitchell&#x27;s wife. It was revealed in October 2004 that the character had been axed, with her final scenes airing in January the following year.

Between October and December 2004, Halfpenny competed in the second series of the celebrity ballroom dancing contest &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, where she was paired with professional dancer Darren Bennett. The couple were crowned the winners of the competition during its live final on 11 December 2004, after receiving the maximum 40 marks from the judging panel. That same week, it was announced that Halfpenny would star as Roxie Hart in the West End musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, beginning in January 2005.

=== 2005–2017: Stage roles, &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, and presenting work ===

Halfpenny earned critical praise for her performance in &quot;The Bodies&quot;, a play adapted from an Émile Zola novel by Peter Flannery, which ran from June to July 2005 at Newcastle&#x27;s Live Theatre. Describing her work as the &quot;dangerously crazed&quot; Thérèse, &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;Halfpenny, forced to remain impassive at the outset, is tough and moving in her portrayal of [the character&#x27;s] descent into madness&quot;. Next, she made a cameo appearance as a Geordie nanny on &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;; guest-starred on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Shameless&quot; as a violent ex-jailbird; hosted the debut episode of the BBC musical theatre tribute &quot;The Sound of Musicals&quot;, where she performed songs from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;; and began playing the regular part of schoolteacher Izzie Redpath on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, for which she won the 2007 &quot;TV Quick&quot; Award for &quot;Best Actress&quot;. The character was later killed in an accidental stabbing during the finale of the show&#x27;s second series, which aired on 26 April 2007. That same year, she narrated the BBC Three documentary series &quot;Freaky Eaters&quot; and the Channel 4 one-off special &quot;Fat Man&#x27;s Warning&quot;.

Halfpenny appeared as Norma Farnes—Spike Milligan&#x27;s long-suffering manager—in Richard Harris&#x27;s &quot;Surviving Spike&quot;, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Windsor in February 2008. In his review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, critic Julian Hall felt that Halfpenny&#x27;s performance &quot;lends added zip to what is already a tightly written play ... [she] successfully evokes the tenacity that Farnes must have had to [endure Milligan]&quot;. Her next roles on stage were Cora in &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; (July to October 2009) and Paulette Bonafonté in the West End production of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, which opened in January 2010. She earned particularly strong notices for her performance in the latter, winning the Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role.

In March 2012, Halfpenny headlined a revival of Mike Leigh&#x27;s 1977 play &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; at the Menier Chocolate Factory, which later transferred to the West End&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre for four months. Her portrayal of the snobbish Beverly was warmly received, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Kate Kellaway calling her &quot;fantastic&quot;, adding: [she] perfectly catches Bev&#x27;s dark side – her selfishness, sexual frustration and dangerous stupidity&quot;. She then portrayed the matriarch of a 1940s household in the supernatural horror miniseries &quot;Lightfields&quot;, which aired between February and March 2013.

Halfpenny featured in two major television projects in 2014: first, the Kay Mellor-produced BBC One drama series &quot;In the Club&quot;, where she played an expectant first-time mother, and then Channel 4&#x27;s seven-part satirical comedy series &quot;Babylon&quot;, in which she co-starred as PC Davina Bancroft. In September that same year, she narrated a segment on the history of North East England as part of the televised opening ceremony for the Great North Run. She then appeared as a timid middle-class holidaymaker in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Way Upstream&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre (April to May 2015), and played one of the principal characters—Jill Drummond, a disabled woman who falls for her humanoid caregiver—on the first season of the science fiction drama series &quot;Humans&quot;, which aired between June and August 2015. Described as a &quot;stylishly slow-burning Sunday night treat&quot; by &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Humans&quot; was Channel 4&#x27;s highest-rated drama in two decades, attracting an average of 6m viewers.

Halfpenny made her radio broadcast debut in May 2017, covering slots on BBC Radio 2 for regular presenters such as Liza Tarbuck and Sara Cox, and later hosting the station&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Sunday&quot; show throughout August 2018. Her acting projects during this period included the controversial BBC miniseries &quot;Three Girls&quot;, an examination of the events surrounding the Rochdale child sex abuse ring. Airing over three consecutive nights in May 2017, the drama received a positive reception, with Halfpenny&#x27;s portrayal of Julie Winshaw—a fictionalised version of one of the parents whose teenage child was exploited—garnering praise.

=== 2018–present: Theatre and television ===

In the stage adaptation of the psychological thriller novel &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;, Halfpenny headlined as Rachel, a dispirited alcoholic who witnesses a murder but struggles to convince people of what she saw. Premiering at the Leeds Playhouse in May 2018, the production was met with mixed reviews, though critics agreed that Halfpenny was its biggest asset, with &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; commenting that she &quot;steals the show ... Her role requires a nuanced performance that keeps the audience guessing [and] it&#x27;s one she delivers with great aplomb&quot;. The following year, she starred as a conflicted parent who accepts hush money after her 13-year-old son is molested by a Hollywood film producer, in the four-part BBC miniseries &quot;Dark Money&quot;.

In Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Drowning&quot;, a mystery thriller that aired over four consecutive nights in February 2021, Halfpenny starred as Jodie Walsh, a grief-stricken mother who comes to believe that her late son may still be alive. In her appraisal of the show for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lucy Mangan said of Halfpenny, &quot;Her presence is always a sign that a programme will be an elevated production. Here, her inability to strike a false or melodramatic note is perfect for the [character]&quot;. Next, she played the supporting role of Doreen Hill in &quot;The Long Shadow&quot;, a seven-part miniseries—based on the crimes of serial killer Peter Sutcliffe—that aired on ITV1 between September and November 2023. &quot;Radio Times&quot; critic James Hibbs was effusive in his praise of the show&#x27;s &quot;strong&quot; cast, calling them &quot;real, fully rounded individuals&quot; and adding, &quot;Everyone brings their A-game in wholly different ways, [including] Halfpenny as the grieving mother of one of Sutcliffe&#x27;s victims&quot;. Speaking of the research she undertook in preparation for playing Hill, Halfpenny said it was the lack of aftercare for the victims that shocked her most: &quot;They were just left to deal with such tragic circumstances [and] in such a public arena, with seemingly no support ... It just really shocked me that they were just left alone, and how little power they had ... We talk so much now about support and therapy and what could we give them and how can we help them. [Back then] it was like, &#x27;Oh, well, that&#x27;s happened&#x27;. I thought it was heartbreaking&quot;.

Halfpenny&#x27;s role in the 2024 adaptation of Shelagh Delaney&#x27;s &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, which debuted at the Royal Exchange, Manchester on 15 March, was met with praise; writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, critic Mark Brown believed her portrayal of working-class single mother Helen to be &quot;suitably monstrous, but with an intelligent, underlying and brittle fragility&quot;. Her next project was Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Cuckoo&quot;, in which she played the mysterious Sian, a lodger hiding a dark secret from the family she&#x27;s living with. Emily Watkins of the &quot;i&quot; newspaper described the miniseries as &quot;well-paced [and] acted&quot;, noting that Halfpenny&#x27;s &quot;flinty gaze&quot; lent her character &quot;a chilling intensity&quot;.

==Other work==
Halfpenny has narrated commercials for Argos, &quot;Children in Need&quot;, Ford Fiesta, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Aunt Bessie&#x27;s, Cocoa Pops, the Royal Air Force, First Choice, and Caledonian Travel.

It was announced in February 2024 that Halfpenny&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Life Reimagined&quot;, would be published by Pan Macmillan. Due for release in June 2024, it touches on the deaths of her father and her ex-partner.

==Personal life==
Halfpenny was born in Leam Lane, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear on 15 July 1975. 

She married fellow actor Craig Conway in 2007; together they have a son, Harvey. The couple divorced in 2010. In 2019, Halfpenny spoke of her grief following the death of her partner, Matt Janes, two years earlier. He died aged 43 after suffering a heart attack.

Halfpenny is an ambassador for Kidscape, a children&#x27;s charity. She was named &quot;Freeman of the Borough of Gateshead&quot; in 2013, in recognition of her services to theatre, television, and charity.

<text>Cutin is one of two waxy polymers that are the main components of the plant cuticle, which covers all aerial surfaces of plants, the other being cutan. It is an insoluble substance with waterproof quality. Cutin also harbors cuticular waxes, which assist in cuticle structure. Cutan, the other major cuticle polymer, is much more readily preserved in fossil records. Cutin consists of omega hydroxy acids and their derivatives, which are interlinked via ester bonds, forming a polyester polymer of indeterminate size.

There are two major monomer families of cutin, the C16 and C18 families. The C16 family consists mainly of 16-hydroxy palmitic acid and 9,16- or 10,16-dihydroxypalmitic acid. The C18 family consists mainly of 18-hydroxy oleic acid, 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxy stearic acid, and 9,10,18-trihydroxystearate.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Jones, (14 May 1940 – 28 May 1982), known as H. Jones, was a British Army officer and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC). He was awarded the VC after being killed in action during the Battle of Goose Green for his actions as commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, during the Falklands War.

==Background==

Jones was born in Putney, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Jones (1888–1957), an American artist, and his Welsh wife, Olwen Pritchard (1902–1990), a nurse. He attended St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School in Seaford, Sussex, Eton College and DLD College London. He joined the British Army on leaving school and, on graduation from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, on 23 July 1960, was commissioned into the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment as a second lieutenant.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 January 1962, captain on 23 July 1966, and major on 31 December 1972, At this time he was brigade major at HQ 3rd Infantry Brigade in Northern Ireland. As such he was responsible for the efforts to find Captain Robert Nairac who had been abducted by the Provisional IRA. Nairac and Jones had become friends and would sometimes go to the Jones household for supper. After a four-day search, the Garda Síochána confirmed that Nairac had been shot and killed in the Republic of Ireland after being smuggled over the border. On 13 December 1977 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services in Northern Ireland that year. On 30 June 1979 he was promoted lieutenant colonel, and on 1 December 1979 he was transferred to the Parachute Regiment. In the 1981 New Year Honours he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Falklands War==

Jones was on holiday in France when he heard the news of the invasion of the Falklands. He had just returned from training in Kenya, and his battalion, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA), was earmarked for deployment for Belize.

Jones&#x27; battalion was attached, alongside 3 PARA, to reinforce 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, the first major infantry formation to be sent south. During the Battle of Goose Green, an attack against entrenched Argentinian positions, with his unit pinned down by heavy fire from MAG machine guns and FAL automatic rifles, he led a charge against the nearest position. He was killed while doing so but the Argentinian unit surrendered shortly afterwards. For his actions he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

Command of 2 PARA passed to Major Chris Keeble. Jones&#x27; body was buried in a battlefield grave at Ajax Bay on 30 May. After the war it was exhumed and re-buried at the Blue Beach War Cemetery in San Carlos on 25 October 1982.

Spencer Fitz-Gibbon, a former TA Para officer and military theorist, wrote in 1995 that, despite his undoubted courage, Jones did more to hinder than to help 2 Para, losing sight of the overall battle picture and failing to allow his sub-unit commanders to exercise mission command, before his fatal attempt to lead &quot;A&quot; Company forward from the position where they had become bogged down.

Margaret Thatcher said &quot;his life was lost, but his death was the turning point in the battle.&quot; The battle demonstrated the UK&#x27;s increasingly unquestionable military superiority, quelling concerns about possible defeat, and led to the release of 112 civilians who had been imprisoned in the local community hall for the best part of a month.

===VC citation===
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London.

==Memorials==
Jones&#x27; grave at Blue Beach War Cemetery is marked with a headstone engraved with the Parachute Regiment&#x27;s insignia and that of the Victoria Cross. The headstone includes the quotation: &quot;He is not the beginning but the continuing of the same unto the end.&quot; A street in Stanley was named H Jones Road in his memory in addition to Jones Avenue in Mount Pleasant air base. A memorial stone to all those killed at the scene of the battle, near Darwin, also bears his name. His name is also on the South Atlantic Task Force Memorial in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, on the wall with the names of the fallen in the Falklands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College, and the Parachute Regiment Memorial at their headquarters in Aldershot; he also has a memorial in the cloisters of Eton College and a plaque on a footpath at Kingswear, Devon. The memorial board from St Peter&#x27;s School, carved with the name of Jones, can be seen in Seaford Museum. In addition the &#x27;Colonel H&#x27; Public house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, is named in his honour. There is a wooden plaque memorial in Kingswear parish church and a copy of the citation is on view near the memorial.
==Family==
Jones&#x27;s widow, Sara, was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for charity work (she is involved with a number of charities related to the armed forces), and since 2003 has been a Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire. Both of their sons, Rupert and David, served as infantry officers in the Devon and Dorsets (now merged into The Rifles). Rupert commanded the 1st Mechanised Brigade from 2012 to 2014, and was promoted to major general in 2016, making him, at 47, the youngest general officer in the British Army at the time.

<text>Muswellbrook ( ) is a town in the Upper Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, about north of Sydney and north-west of Newcastle.

Geologically, Muswellbrook is situated in the northern parts of the Sydney basin, bordering the New England region.

The area is predominantly known for coal mining and horse breeding, but has also developed a reputation for gourmet food and wine production. As of the 2021 census Muswellbrook has a population of 12,272. Located to the south of the Muswellbrook township are two coal fuelled power stations, Liddell and Bayswater. They were commissioned in 1973 and mid 1980s respectively and employ approximately 500 people from the area.

==History==
Before European settlement of the region the Wonnarua and Gamilaroi peoples occupied the land. The first European to explore the area was Chief Constable John Howe in 1819, with the first white settlement occurring in the 1820s. The township of Muswellbrook was gazetted on 23 October 1833. To the south, &quot;Forbestown&quot; was established by the sons of Francis Forbes in 1842; the name was changed in 1848 to &quot;South Muswellbrook&quot; to prevent confusion with the town of Forbes.

== Heritage listings ==
Muswellbrook has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 7 Bridge Street: Muswellbrook Post Office
*132 Bridge Street: Weidmann Cottage
* 142–144 Bridge Street: Loxton House
* 178, 180–188 Bridge Street: Eatons Group
* 710 Denman Road: Edinglassie
* Denman Road: Rous Lench
* Hunter Terrace: St Alban&#x27;s Anglican Church
* Main Northern railway: Muswellbrook railway station 

==Etymology==
&quot;Mussel Creek&quot; (now called &quot;Muscle Creek&quot;) was first named by a party of surveyors who found mussels in the small stream while camping along its banks in the early 19th century. The present spelling of Muswellbrook has a disputed etymology. Historians largely subscribe to one of two theories:
# that the name derives from the Muswell Hill area of London (England), due to the influence of Sir Francis Forbes whose wife, Amelia, was born and schooled in that town; or
# that the name is a gradual corruption of the original gazetted name &quot;Musclebrook&quot;, eventually adopted as the official spelling due to common use.

==Population==
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 12,272 people in Muswellbrook.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 13.1% of the population.
* 84.7% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were New Zealand 1.5%, England 1.0% and Philippines 0.9%.
* 86.9% of people only spoke English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.6%, Anglican 23.0%, and Catholic 20.2%.

==Transport==
The New England Highway currently passes through the town. A route was selected for a bypass in 2006 but the Australian Government suspended the project in August 2008. Denman Road provides a connection to the Golden Highway.&lt;br&gt;

=== Rail ===
Muswellbrook railway station is served by local (Newcastle to Scone) and long-distance rail (Sydney to Armidale and Moree) services. Interstate coaches and local bus services also call at the station.

Muswellbrook lies at the junction of the Main Northern railway line and the Merriwa line, part of a cross country rail line to Gulgong. As such, it formed an important junction, as well as serving the numerous coal mining sidings found within a short distance from the main station building.

==Popular culture==
The Steely Dan song &quot;Black Friday&quot; from the 1975 album &quot;Katy Lied&quot; contains the lyrics: 
&quot;When Black Friday comes,
I&#x27;ll fly down to Muswellbrook,
gonna strike all the big red words
from my little black book.

Gonna do just what I please,
gonna wear no socks and shoes,
with nothing to do but feed
all the kangaroos.&quot;

Songwriter Donald Fagen explained the lyrics in an interview with Paul Cashmere of Undercover Music; &quot;I think we had a map and put our finger down at the place that we thought would be the furthest away from New York or wherever we were at the time&quot;.

Donald Horne spent his early childhood in Muswellbrook and the first volume of his autobiography, &quot;The Education of Young Donald&quot;, features an extensive description of life in the town in the 1920s and early 1930s. 

Muswellbrook is also mentioned in Thomas Keneally&#x27;s book &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot;.

<doc id="1157244" wikidata="Q57442" url="?curid=1157244" title="Victor Klemperer">
<text>Victor Klemperer (9 October 188111 February 1960) was a German literary scholar and diarist. His journals, published posthumously in Germany in 1995, detailed his life under the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, the fascist Third Reich, and the communist German Democratic Republic.

Three volumes of his diaries have been published in English translations: &quot;I Shall Bear Witness,&quot; &quot;To the Bitter End&quot;, and &quot;The Lesser Evil&quot;. The first two, which cover the period of the Third Reich, have become standard sources and have been extensively quoted. His book LTI – Notizbuch eines Philologen ([[Victor Klemperer|L]]ingua [[Victor Klemperer|T]]ertii [[Victor Klemperer|I]]mperii: Language of the Third Reich), published in English as &quot;The Language of the Third Reich&quot;, examined how Nazi propaganda co-opted and corrupted German words and expressions.

==Early life and education==

Klemperer was born in Landsberg an der Warthe (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland) as the youngest child of a Jewish family. His parents were Wilhelm Klemperer, a rabbi, and Henriette née Frankel. Victor had three brothers (Georg, Felix, Berhold) and four sisters (Margarete, Hedwig, Marta, Valeska). His oldest brothers were physicians: Georg, 1865–1946, director of the hospital Berlin-Moabit (which treated Vladimir Lenin); Felix, 1866–1932, director of the hospital Berlin-Reinickendorf.

Victor was a cousin of the conductor Otto Klemperer, and first cousin once removed to Otto&#x27;s son, the actor Werner Klemperer. In 1903 Klemperer converted to Protestantism for the first time, shortly thereafter returning to Judaism.

Victor Klemperer attended several gymnasia. He was a student of philosophy, Romance and German studies at universities in Munich, Geneva, Paris and Berlin from 1902 to 1905, and later worked as a journalist and writer in Berlin, until he resumed his studies in Munich from 1912.

Though not a religious man, Victor Klemperer needed a religious identity, as Jew, Christian or religious dissenter, to support his career in German academia of the time. He chose Christianity as being most compatible with his primary sense of identity as, simply, a German, and became baptised again in Berlin in 1912.

He completed his doctorate (on Montesquieu) in 1913.

==Career==
Klemperer was habilitated under the supervision of Karl Vossler in 1914. From 1914 to 1915, he lectured at the University of Naples, after which he enlisted as a military volunteer in World War I. From winter 1915 to March 1916 he was deployed as an artilleryman on the Western Front, and later with the Military Censor in Kaunas and Leipzig.

From 1920 until 1935 he was Professor of Romance Languages at the Technical University of Dresden.

===Third Reich===
Despite his conversion to Protestantism in 1912 and his strong identification with German culture, Klemperer&#x27;s life started to worsen considerably after the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power in 1933. Under the 1933 Nazi &quot;First Racial Definition,&quot; a &quot;Jew&quot; was a racial category, not just a religious one. As such, Klemperer was considered a Jew even though he had converted to Protestantism. (This racial definition included those with only one Jewish parent or even one Jewish grandparent; a person was considered a &quot;Mischling&quot; if he had one Jewish parent or grandparent, regardless of religious belief.)

In 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed removing all non-Aryan professors from their profession, with the exception of those who had fought in World War I. This exception allowed Klemperer to continue in his position a little longer, although without the right to use the university library or other faculty privileges.

Klemperer was gradually forced out of his job and forced to retire in 1935. Although he was allowed to keep part of his pension, the money quickly ran out and he and his wife had to take cleaning jobs (this is unsubstantiated in his diaries).

The couple lost their right to drive and had to sell their car, and their housekeeper had to resign due to the law that prohibited Jews from employing Aryan women. Eventually the Klemperers were forced to put down their household cat, a tomcat named Muschel, because of a restriction as to Jews&#x27; ownership of pets. A Nazi law obliged every Jewish female or male to add Sarah or Israel, respectively, as a middle name on all official documents, allowing Jews to be identified as such whenever required to give their full name. (Klemperer dropped the &quot;Israel&quot; as soon as he could safely do so.)

That same year, and subsequently, Klemperer was so dismayed with the spread of antisemitism, even among those who professed to be against the Nazis, that he from time to time entertained the possibility of emigration to the US.

A diary entry—for April 10, 1940—records other problems with emigration: &quot;Meeting with the emigration adviser of the Jewish Community, result less than zero: You really must get out—we see no possibility. American-Jewish committees support only observant Jews.&quot; In the end his connection to his fatherland was too strong, even after Kristallnacht in November 1938, and the outbreak of war. During the pogrom later in November 1938 their house was searched by Nazis who found Klemperer&#x27;s saber from World War I—he was arrested briefly and released. By this time he had come to concede that &quot;No one can take my Germanness away from me, but my nationalism and patriotism are gone forever.&quot; This release can be attached to the fact that he had a German wife. Although the day after his arrest he wrote to his brother Georg asking for assistance in leaving Germany, in the end he did not do so.

Since his wife, Eva, was &quot;Aryan&quot;, Klemperer avoided deportation, often narrowly, but in 1940, he and his wife were rehoused under miserable conditions in a &quot;Jews&#x27; House&quot; (&quot;Judenhaus&quot;) with other &quot;mixed couples&quot;. Here, and especially when he ventured out, or at factories where he was forced to work, he was routinely questioned, mistreated, and humiliated by the Gestapo, Hitler Youth members and Dresden citizens. Only because of his &quot;Aryan&quot; German wife were the couple able to procure food enough to subsist. Klemperer and his fellow Jews became aware only gradually of the nature of the atrocities and the scale of extermination being carried out at camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, even as they watched friends and neighbors deported and as their own risk of deportation mounted.

===Flight===
On 13 February 1945, Klemperer witnessed the delivery of notices of deportation to some of the last remaining members of the Jewish community in Dresden, and feared that the authorities would soon also send him to his death. On the following three nights the Allies heavily bombed Dresden for the first time, causing massive damage and a firestorm; during the chaos that followed, Klemperer removed his yellow star (punishable by death if discovered) on 19 February, joined a refugee column, and escaped into American-controlled territory. He and his wife survived, and Klemperer&#x27;s diary narrates their return, largely on foot through Bavaria and Eastern Germany, to their house in Dölzschen, on the outskirts of Dresden. They managed to reclaim the house, which the Nazis had &quot;aryanised&quot;.

===Post-war===

After the war, Klemperer joined the communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and was reinstated in a university post at Leipzig University. His former friend, historian , who had severed connections with Klemperer upon his dismissal from the University of Dresden, welcomed him back as if nothing had happened.

Klemperer became a significant cultural figure in East Germany, lecturing at the universities of Greifswald, Berlin and Halle. He was a delegate of the Cultural Association of the GDR in the GDR&#x27;s Parliament (&quot;Volkskammer&quot;) from 1950 to 1958, and frequently mentioned in his later diary his frustration at its lack of power and its largely ceremonial role.

==Personal life and death==
Victor Klemperer married Eva Schlemmer, an &quot;Aryan&quot; German in 1906. Intermarriage helped Victor Klemperer to survive, but brought down his wife&#x27;s societal status. The Nazi Government could not effectively force people to divorce, so many intermarried Jewish and non-Jewish Germans stayed married, despite scrutiny by others. 
Klemperer died 11 February 1960.

==Work==
*&quot;The Language of the Third Reich&quot;, a study on the language of Nazi propaganda.
*&quot;Tagebücher&quot; (Berlin, Aufbau), Klemperer&#x27;s diary, published in 1995, an immediate literary sensation and rapidly became a bestseller in Germany. An English translation of the years spanning the Nazi seizure of power through Klemperer&#x27;s death has appeared in three volumes: &quot;I Shall Bear Witness&quot; (1933 to 1941), &quot;To The Bitter End&quot; (1942 to 1945) and &quot;The Lesser Evil&quot; (1945 to 1959).

Klemperer&#x27;s diary, which he kept up throughout the Nazi era, provides an exceptional account of day-to-day life under the tyranny of the Third Reich. Klemperer&#x27;s diaries from the Nazi period chronicle the restricted daily life of Jews during the Nazi terror, including the onset of a succession of prohibitions concerning many aspects of everyday existence, such as finances, transportation, medical care, the maintenance and use of household help, food and diet, and the possession of appliances, newspapers, and other items. He also gives accounts of suicides, household searches, and the deportation of his friends, mostly to Theresienstadt. Throughout his experience, Klemperer maintained his sense of identity as a German, expressing even in 1942 that &quot;&quot;I&quot; am German, and still waiting for the Germans to come back; they have gone to ground somewhere&quot;. Although this is one of the phrases most evocative of Klemperer&#x27;s despair over the corruption of German culture, his sense of who and what was truly &quot;German&quot; evolved considerably during the war. Especially in the final weeks of the war and immediately after Germany&#x27;s surrender, when Klemperer was free to mix and talk with (or eavesdrop on) a wide variety of Germans, his observations of the &quot;German&quot; identity show how complex this question was, and why it was so central to his purpose in writing the LTI and his journals.

In the diary, the much-feared Gestapo is seen carrying out daily, humiliating, and brutal house searches, delivering beatings, hurling insults, and robbing inhabitants of coveted foodstuffs and other household items. In addition, the diary relates the profound uncertainty all Germans—Jews and non-Jews—experienced because of the paucity of reliable information about the war&#x27;s progress, largely due to the propaganda so central to the Reich&#x27;s conduct of the war and of the Final Solution.
This diary details the Nazis&#x27; perversion of the German language for propaganda purposes in entries that Klemperer used as the basis for his book &#x27;[LTI – Lingua Tertii Imperii&quot;.

==Awards==
*In 1995, Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for &quot;Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten. Tagebücher 1933–1945&quot;.

==Documentary==
In 2000, Herbert Gantschacher wrote, together with Katharina and Jürgen Rostock, the documentary play &quot;Chronicle 1933–1945&quot; using original documents from the biographies of Robert Ley and Victor Klemperer. The first performance took place in 2000 in the documentation centre at the planned &quot;Strength Through Joy&quot; beach resort Prora on the island of Rügen in Germany.

In 2004, Stan Neumann directed a documentary based on Klemperer&#x27;s diaries, &quot;La langue ne ment pas&quot; (&quot;Language does not lie&quot;), which considers the importance of Klemperer&#x27;s observations and the role of the witness in extreme situations.

<doc id="1157247" wikidata="Q2788891" url="?curid=1157247" title="Mortville Manor">
<text>Mortville Manor () is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Lankhor released in 1987 for Atari ST. The game was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Amiga and Sinclair QL. An MS-DOS version was released in 1988 adapted by Clement Roques. &quot;Mortville Manor&quot; was the first game with speech synthesis and was sold 10,000 copies around Europe. &quot;Mortville Manor&quot; was followed by its sequel &quot;Maupiti Island&quot;.

==Plot==
The game takes place in France in the 1950s. The plot begins in the office of Jérôme Lange, a famous private detective, who receives a letter from his childhood friend Julia Defranck, in which she writes that she is ill and asks him to investigate strange events at Mortville Manor. Upon arrival, Jérôme is informed of Julia&#x27;s death with a storm approaching, and begins his search around the manor.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mortville Manor&quot; is a first-person adventure game with a point-and-click interface. The player takes on the role of Jérôme Lange, observing the world though first-person perspective. The player can move around Mortevielle&#x27;s mansion by using the toolbar at the top of the screen and giving the hero commands from the drop-down lists. The player also has the opportunity to interrogate individual residents of the Mortevielle estate, who move freely around the game.

== Development ==
The first version of &quot;Mortville Manor was&quot; released for the Sinclair QL and was developed by two employees of the Kyilkhor studio who operated with the Pyramide publishing house Bruno Gourier and Bernard Grelaud. Gourier and Grelaud teamed up with siblings Béatrice and Jean-Luc Langlois and started their own company Lankhor. With its technical qualities and attractive price, the Atari ST was gaining momentum in France and the company decides to develop for this machine as a priority. &quot;Mortville Manor&quot; was released for the Atari ST in 1987. The Langlois siblings developed a speech synthesizer that read other characters speeches. Dominique Sablons responded with a complete redesign of the Amiga and MS-DOS graphics.

==Reception and legacy==
In France, &quot;Mortville Manor&quot; was a great artistic success. The magazine &quot;Tilt&quot; gave the game two Tilt d&#x27;Or awards for the best adventure game of the year and for the sound design. Tilt reviewer Mathieu Brisou found the game to be a &quot;superbly crafted&quot; game based on a &quot;classic yet enjoyable&quot; script. The magazine Génération 4 wrote that the game was &quot;one of the best adventure games in French available on the Atari ST&quot;. The game was also considered one of the greatest video games ever made for the Amiga. Eric See-To for &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote that the game was a &quot;fairly absorbing adventure&quot;, calling it unique, while criticizing the graphics and stating it was difficult to hear the digitised speech.

In 2015, an amateur theater company known as Théâtre de l&#x27;Embellie in Montauban paid a tribute to the game through the show &quot;Les Secrets du manoir de Mortevielle&quot; and the play the game in 2021.

<text>Skänninge () is a locality situated in Mjölby Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden with 3,140 inhabitants in 2010. It lies about 10 km north of the municipal seat Mjölby.

Before the local government reform in 1971, the &quot;City of Skänninge&quot; was a municipal entity of its own.

Skänninge is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

The cycler Bernhard Britz was born here

== Geography ==
The town is located on the Skena river.

== History ==

The history of the town goes back to the 11th century, making it one of the oldest cities in Sweden. The town has changed little since then and is still the same size as the same street structure. Many locations are recognizable since the Middle Ages.

One of the older buildings in the medieval Brick Gothic Church of Our Lady, Sw. &quot;Vårfrukyrkan&quot;, constructed by the town&#x27;s German population in honor of the Virgin Mary. Apart from the church, the town also contains the remains of a monastery of the Dominican order.

In 1250, the reigning family of Folkung had its main quarters near Skänninge, and the town developed into something of the Götaland capital, and the market place became one of the richest and most attended in the country. However, in the 13th century, the nearby located city of Vadstena surpassed it in interest. Furthermore, Skännige suffered fires in 1477 and 1466.

The annual Skänninge Market with its 1000-year-old tradition is still being held in August every year and visited by around 120,000 people.

<doc id="1157265" wikidata="Q1950449" url="?curid=1157265" title="Putauaki">
<text>Putauaki (; also known in English as Mount Edgecumbe) is a dacite volcanic cone in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand. Located east of Rotorua and three kilometres east of Kawerau, it is the easternmost vent of the Taupo Volcanic Zone adjacent to the Ōkataina volcanic centre. The mountain rises to above sea level, and is visible from the waters of the Bay of Plenty, to the north. A King of the Mountain race was run on Putauaki as part of the international King of the Mountain series between 1955 and 2020, and proceeds were donated to charity.

==History==
The last substantial volcanic eruption occurred at 540 ± 130 BCE, producing a cubic kilometre of lava. There was a previous eruption dated to 1380 ± 50 BCE. The volcano produced the Edgecumbe Formation which are pyroxene-bearing andesite to dacite lava flows, domes and minor pyroclastic tephra.

Captain James Cook named the mountain &quot;Mount Edgecumbe&quot; on 2 November 1769, possibly in honour of John Edgecombe, the sergeant of marines on his vessel, the &quot;Endeavour&quot;.
The mountain&#x27;s official name changed back to Putauaki in 1925.

The New Zealand government took part of the mountain from the Ngāti Awa people in the 1880s as part of a series of North Island land confiscations, supposedly for the purposes of military settlement. In a 1999 report the Waitangi Tribunal declared the confiscation illegal because there was no prospect of placing settlers on the mountain.

==Legendary source of name ==
Māori legend tells of a love affair that Pūtauaki had with Whakaari/White Island. 
Another version of the legend is that Pūtauaki was lonely after losing a fight for Pīhanga (another mountain) so when he met Tarawera he decided to start a relationship with her. After raising a son and years of a troubled marriage, Pūtauaki cast his eye out towards the sea, where the very beautiful Whakaari was. The two would call out to each other at night while Tarawera slept. One night Pūtauaki could not contain his love any longer and decided to travel out to be with Whakaari. It is said that a mountain can only move once in their life and only at night so Pūtauaki had to travel across the land fast. Little did he know, his son had awoken and was following him. He heard the little whimper from his son and turned around. He tried to tell his son to stay with Tarawera but the little mountain would not leave his father. Then the sun rose and froze the two mountains where they were. When Tarawera awoke she saw that her husband had left and she started to weep, thus creating the Tarawera Falls and river. Until this day Tarawera still cries and Whakaari still calls out for her lover, who is frozen to the spot near Kawerau.

== Transmitter ==
Putauaki is home to a major FM radio transmitter for the eastern Bay of Plenty. Prior to digital television transition in December 2013, the transmitter was also the main analogue television transmitter for the area.

<text>The Battlefield Line Railway is a heritage railway in Leicestershire, England. It runs from Shackerstone to Shenton, via Market Bosworth, which is a total of . Shenton is near Bosworth Field; this is the location of the final battle of the Wars of the Roses, immortalised in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, giving the railway its name.

== Overview ==
The railway runs steam and diesel-hauled trains every weekend and bank holiday from March to December. In addition, a summer mid-week service is operated by the heritage diesel railcar; these run on Wednesdays in July and September and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays in August. Special events take place throughout the year, including the Christmas Santa Specials.

== History ==

The railway used to be part of the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway, who operated the line jointly between Moira West Junction and Nuneaton. The first trains ran along this section in 1873. At Shackerstone station, there was once a junction where one section branched off towards Moira and Ashby and the other went towards Coalville Junction. In 1883, the Charnwood Forest Railway was opened, which extended the branch from Coalville Junction to Loughborough&#x27;s Derby Road station, passing through the village of Whitwick and town of Shepshed. In the 1923 Grouping, these lines were assigned to the London Midland and Scottish Railway. In 1931, the last scheduled passenger train went down the Charnwood Forest branch, with the line then only being open to freight and excursions until the 1960s. The Coalville JunctionShackerstone section was dismantled and closed completely in 1964. The AshbyNuneaton line had its last passenger service in 1965, which was an enthusiasts&#x27; special, before British Rail pulled the rails up in 1970.
In its heyday, Shackerstone was a busy station, with steam trains doing the workings between Ashby and Nuneaton, whilst a railcar did the service between Shackerstone and Loughborough Derby Road.

The line was originally double track but was later singled. Part of the line was called the Bluebell Line (the Charnwood Forest Line, Hugglescote to Loughborough Derby Road station; this line was only accessible via the ANJR).

The royal train now in the National Railway Museum went to Shackerstone on its first outing in December 1902. It conveyed King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra and Princess Victoria on their way to Gopsall Hall, where Handel is reputed to have composed his oratorio Messiah.

=== Renovation project ===

The Shackerstone Railway Society was set up in 1969 at Market Bosworth, but soon moved to Shackerstone in 1970, as they needed a proper home for their first steam engine. When they got to Shackerstone they found one through line still intact, and their first aim was to build some sidings. Later they reinstated the &quot;down&quot; platform and connected the sidings to the line to Market Bosworth.

In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of the line, a small train of open wagons was hauled to Market Bosworth. Following the successful conclusions of the negotiations with British Rail, a start was made on track rearrangements which created run-round loops at both ends of the line and a number of sidings at Shackerstone.

In the 1980s, the Battlefield Line launched a campaign to extend their line to Shenton. This involved buying of track and in 1992, after a successful campaign, the inaugural service arrived, hauled by the appropriately named 0-6-0 tank engine &quot;Richard III.&quot;
In 1994, Shackerstone Station featured in an episode of Rosie &amp; Jim showcasing how a Steam Locomotive works. Featured was Hunslet 3855 &#x27;Glasshoughton Number 4&#x27;

== Route ==
The first section of the journey travelling south from (Grid ref ) is a climbing gradient which continues until the train is clear of the station limits. The signal box on the left is the oldest Midland Railway Co. type one box still in operational use. The train then passes under the first bridge which carries the road to Barton-in-the-Beans, and into open farmland.


 is from Shackerstone. There are usually stored locomotives or wagons here. To the right can be seen the old buildings and signal box which used to control part of the operation of the station.

South of Market Bosworth station, the train passes Aqueduct Cottage and the Ashby Canal aqueduct beyond it. Trains slow as they cross the road bridge between Shenton and Sutton Cheney. As the line curves to the right, the train approaches the terminus at (), just over away from Shackerstone. The station pottery is the only surviving part of the original station. The present station is the reconstructed Humberstone Road station from Leicester. At the end of the line is a headshunt underneath an old cattle bridge. The small bridge was previously used to allow safe passage of farm traffic over the original railway.

<text>Appledore is a village and civil parish in the Ashford District of Kent, England. The village centre is on the northern edge of the Romney Marsh, 12 miles (19 km) south-west of Ashford town. The northerly part of this village is Appledore Heath.

==History==
The name is first recorded in the 10th century as &quot;apuldre&quot; (meaning apple tree in Old English). Alternatively, a Brythonic origin from or connected with &quot;dwr/dor&quot;, meaning water, has been posited.

Appledore was once a port on the estuary of the River Rother. Famously, the greater part of the Danish army (280 ships - 5000 men) wintered at Appledore in 892–93, before moving into Wessex and suffering defeat at the hands of the Saxons led by King Alfred&#x27;s son Edward the Elder at Farnham in Surrey. The defeated Danes fell back to Benfleet in Essex where they were again defeated in battle.
The importance of Appledore as a port diminished suddenly in the 13th-century when two great storms - the first on 4 February 1287 and again sometime the following December – caused the river Rother to change its course; the village street now leads down to the Royal Military Canal. A French raid in 1380 resulted in the burning of the church: it was later rebuilt. The village was permitted to hold a market in the main street by Edward II. In 1804, when there was threat of invasion by Napoleon the Royal Military Canal was built: Appledore stands on its northern bank. The &quot;Rhee Wall&quot;, a 13th-century waterway, was built to carry silt away from the eastern part of the Romney Marsh; it runs from Appledore to New Romney.

==In film, the media and literature==
Appledore was the setting for A. A. Milne&#x27;s famous verse poem, &quot;The Knight Whose Armour Didn&#x27;t Squeak&quot;. Milne lived west in Hartfield, Sussex.

The fictional village of Plummergen, in the &quot;Miss Seeton&quot; series of crime novels by Heron Carvic, is based on Appledore.

Appledore features in the series Darling Buds of May.

==Religion==
The medieval parish church is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.

==Transport==
The B2080 is a local road connecting Appledore with Tenterden and Brenzett, where it meets the A259 South Coast Trunk Road. The Royal Military Road follows the canal southwest from Appledore to Rye.

The Marshlink Line railway line runs between and via Appledore railway station, which is around from the village. The line reduces from dual to single track beyond the station towards and Hastings.

==Education==
St Augustine of Canterbury Catholic Primary School is located in the area.

== Parkwood ==

Parkwood is an woodland east south east of Tenterden near Appledore.

A car park is along the Woodchurch Road, heading north from Appledore towards Brattle.

It is managed by Kent County Council&#x27;s Country Parks service.
It is noted for its bluebells in spring and for nightingales. There are woodland walks and panoramic views over Appledore and Romney Marshes.

The woodland is frequently coppiced for various timber uses. Including oak thinnings being used in Shorne Woods Country Park&#x27;s new visitor centre, as the window and roof joinery.

The wood, is surrounded by three other woods, Great Heron Wood (to the North), Little Heron Wood (to the East) and Butness Wood (further to the East).

He continued to play on loan with the Sounders in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, he scored 8 goals and 4 assists in 27 games as the team reached the A-League championship. He scored four goals for the Sounders in the 2005 USL First Division USL-1 playoffs. His three goals led Seattle past the Portland Timbers and his stoppage time goal was the winner as Seattle beat the Montreal Impact 2–1. Seattle went on to win the 2005 Championship. The Earthquakes placed Levesque on waivers on November 16, 2005, after he played only one game that season with their first team.
In February 2006, Levesque signed a year-long deal to return to Seattle Sounders. He scored two goals and three assists during the regular season and led the team in minutes played. In 2007, he was named second team All-League. At the end of the season, he served as a guest player in two exhibition games with USL-1 teams, the Vancouver Whitecaps and Portland Timbers, against MLS teams.

After a lengthy trial for most of early 2009, Levesque was signed by the expansion MLS franchise Seattle Sounders FC in March 2009. He was used primarily as a reserve player, occasionally appearing as a substitute or a starting player in games of lesser importance. He scored a goal against the Portland Timbers in the 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, as well as the winning goal against D.C. United in the Open Cup Final. He also scored the winning goal in the 89th minute against D.C. United a year later in 2010 MLS league play. In June 2011, Levesque scored 2 goals in the Sounders&#x27; 4–2 win against the New York Red Bulls, including his famous &quot;scuba goal&quot; celebration. On July 16, 2011, he scored another goal against the Colorado Rapids.

Levesque announced his retirement in July 2012, playing his final match for the Sounders in a friendly against Chelsea F.C. on July 18. Fans celebrated the match, jokingly referring it to a testimonial, and King County Executive Dow Constantine declared &quot;Roger Levesque Day&quot; in his honor. Levesque was named Director of Community Outreach for Seattle Sounders FC in 2014.

<doc id="1157288" wikidata="Q1347603" url="?curid=1157288" title="Oliver J. Flanagan">
<text>Oliver James Flanagan (22 May 1920 – 26 April 1987) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Defence from 1976 to 1977 and as a Parliamentary Secretary from 1954 to 1957 and from 1975 to 1976. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Laois-Offaly constituency from 1943 to 1987.

He was elected to the Dáil fourteen times between 1943 and 1982, topping the poll on almost every occasion. He was Father of the Dáil from 1977 until his retirement in 1987, and remains one of the longest-serving members in the history of the Dáil.

Flanagan was a social conservative, who famously claimed that &quot;there was no sex in Ireland before television&quot;. An anti-semite and anti-Mason, he used his maiden speech in the Dáil, on 9 July 1943, to urge the government to emulate the Nazis and &quot;rout the Jews out of this country... where the bees are there is honey, and where the Jews are there is money&quot; and called for the banning of the Freemasons.

Nonetheless, he was consistently popular in his own constituency, largely because of the attention he paid to individual voters&#x27; petitions and concerns. He has been described as &quot;one of the cutest of cute hoors in the history of the Dáil&quot;.

==Personal life==
Flanagan was born in Mountmellick, County Laois, on 22 May 1920. He was educated at Mountmellick Boys National School and University College Dublin. He then worked as a carpenter and auctioneer. He was a member of the Catholic fraternal organisation the Knights of Saint Columbanus, and in 1978, was conferred a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul I, given in Rome on 20 September 1978.

==Monetary Reform Association (1943–1954)==
Flanagan first held political office in 1942, when he was elected as a Councillor to Laois County Council, a position he would hold for almost forty-five years.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as an Independent TD for the Laois–Offaly constituency at the 1943 general election – the third youngest person ever to have been elected to the Dáil at that time. He stood for election on the Monetary Reform Association ticket, an anti-semitic and Social Credit party confined to his own constituency which proposed reducing the supposed Jewish stranglehold on the financial system.

During the campaign, Flanagan wrote to Fr Denis Fahey: &quot;Just a line letting you know we are going ahead with the election campaign in Laois-Offaly against the Jew-Masonic System which is imposed on us. The people are coming to us – but it&#x27;s hard to get the people to understand how they are held down by the Jews and Masons, who control their very lives.&quot;

He used his maiden speech in the Dáil to urge the government to use the Emergency Powers Acts to &quot;rout the Jews out of this country&quot;:
Nonetheless, he was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1944 general election, with more than twice as many votes as he had won the previous year.

In 1947, he caused a controversy when he levelled accusations of corruption against members of the Fianna Fáil government, including Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, Minister for Justice Gerald Boland and Minister for Industry and Commerce Seán Lemass. A tribunal of inquiry comprising three judges investigated his allegations and found them to be untrue. Despite the judges&#x27; conclusion that Flanagan had lied to the tribunal, his vote increased by 45% at the 1948 general election.

During a 1952 Dáil debate, after John A. Costello had said &quot;I made no reference to an Adoption of Children Bill&quot;, Flanagan quipped &quot;Deputy Flynn would be more qualified to do that&quot;. John Flynn, who was not in the chamber at the time, interpreted this as an insulting innuendo, and later punched Flanagan in the Dáil restaurant. The Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privilege condemned the conduct of both TDs.

==Fine Gael TD (1952–1987)==
Flanagan joined Fine Gael in 1952. He served in government as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture from 1954 to 1957. In 1957, Fine Gael returned to opposition and Flanagan became front bench Spokesperson for Lands. In 1975, he was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.

When Paddy Donegan switched departments following the &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; controversy in 1976, Flanagan succeeded him as Minister for Defence, in Liam Cosgrave&#x27;s government. He served as Minister for six months, until Fine Gael lost power following the 1977 general election. He was a representative on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1977 to 1987. Due to ill health, Flanagan did not contest the 1987 general election. His son, Charles Flanagan, was elected to his seat. Oliver Flanagan died two months after the election.

<doc id="1157291" wikidata="Q5226062" url="?curid=1157291" title="Darwinian Happiness">
<text>Darwinian Happiness: Evolution As a Guide for Living and Understanding Human Behavior, , is a 2002 book by the Norwegian biologist Bjørn Grinde from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. He argues that human emotions find their cause in evolution, and offers ways by which we can use this to our advantage.

More specifically, mammals are equipped with a nerve system that enables them to distinguish not only between pleasant and unpleasant sensations, but positive and negative experiences in general. While the biological term fitness refers to the capacity to create offspring, happiness (or quality of life) is, at least in a biological perspective, a question of the qualities of the experiences our nervous system offers us.

In order to improve these experiences there are two main principles to consider:

#To utilize the rewarding sensations the brain has evolved to offer in a way that gives optimal long-term benefits; and, similarly, to avoid punishing sensations.
#To avoid stress and maladaptive ways of living in order to have a healthy mind with optimal potential for positive experiences.

As to the first principle, humans may actually have been equipped with more powerful positive and negative sensations, compared to other mammals, due to our capacity for free will. That is, evolution might tend to add stronger incentives for behavior benefiting the genes in an individual with a powerful free will; as otherwise, the free will could easily result in maladaptive behavior.

As to the second principle, it may be added that, as a rule of thumb, we ought to adapt our way of living to how we are designed by evolution to live. Current ideas in evolutionary medicine and evolutionary psychology suggest that mismatches between the environment of evolutionary adaptation and the present way of living may cause somatic and mental health problems. Such adverse mismatches, referred to as discords, are obviously detrimental to quality of life. For example, unlike Europeans, Indigenous Australians have not had many generations exposed to alcohol, and so are prone to alcohol abuse and the social deprivation it causes.

Grinde argues that &quot;Chemical stimulants do not appear to be a good long-term strategy for contentment.&quot;

<text>The Bowes Railway, built by George Stephenson in 1826, is the world&#x27;s only operational preserved standard gauge cable railway system. It was built to transport coal from pits in Durham to boats on the River Tyne. The site is a scheduled monument. The railway is open every week on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (Easter til October) as well as on a number of event days throughout the year.

==History==

===Background===
The Grand Allies, a partnership of businessmen including John Bowes, opened a colliery at Springwell in Durham. A railway was needed to transport the coal to the River Tyne. The plan was to build inclined planes and use a combination of steam power and gravity to move the coal wagons. The railway was designed by George Stephenson, who built the Hetton colliery railway completed in 1822.

===Construction===
The railway was built between Mount Moor and Jarrow via Springwell village. The first section, between Springwell and Jarrow, opened on 17 January 1826. Mount Moor followed in April 1826. When the line opened it comprised four inclined planes: one steep incline from Mount Moor to Blackham&#x27;s Hill, and one from Blackham&#x27;s Hill to Springwell. At Blackham&#x27;s Hill, the summit of both inclines, was the &quot;hauler house&quot;, housing stationary engines to wind the ropes. A long self-acting incline ran from Springwell. Nearly of locomotive-worked line extended to Jarrow where a final incline served the coal staiths. The line was extended across the Team Valley to Kibblesworth Colliery in May 1842. The railway was completed in 1854 when a link from Marley Hill to Kibblesworth was connected enabling collieries in Dipton to be accessed.

===Operation===

From 1 January 1947, the railway was owned and operated by the National Coal Board. After 1974 no inclines remained working and the line was only worked north east of Wardley. The last day the inclines were used, Friday 4 October 1974, was filmed by BBC and Tyne-Tees TV crews.

What was left of the Bowes Railway north east of the inclines was served by a shed at Wardley. The line was reduced in length, until at the end there was only about in use. This last section closed on 10 January 1986, a few days short of the 180th anniversary. This attenuated system the NCB called the &quot;Monkton Railways&quot;, after the coke works that was its mainstay between 1975 and 1986.

==Preserved railway==

Tyne &amp; Wear Industrial Monuments Trust was established April 1975 and took control of the line around Springwell from the National Coal Board through the medium of county council direction. By 1975 Springwell Workshops were building replica locomotives such as Locomotion No. 1 trading as Locomotion Enterprises.

The preserved Bowes railway, includes Springwell Colliery workshops, a one mile passenger railway and a further mile of rope hauled inclines. 
Visitors can visit the Victorian workshops and see engineering and blacksmithing demonstrations. A tour of the railway buildings, see the railway&#x27;s wagon fleet as well as visit the small museum, cafe and shop can all be done at Springwell.

In the future the railway wishes to restart passenger rides and rope haulage demonstrations for the benefit of the public.

===Rope haulage===
====Original system====
When the Bowes Railway was in full operation the line employed eight rope-worked inclined planes. Two of these (the Springwell and Birkheads inclines) were operated on the self-acting principle; the weight of descending full wagons hauled up the empty wagons via a rope running around a return wheel at the top of the hill. On the remaining six inclines (the Kibblesworth, Black Fell, Blackhams Hill East and West, Starrs and Allerdene Inclines), the ropes were driven by a stationary steam or later electric haulage engine located at the incline top. This type of railway operation pre-dates modern locomotive-type operations, and was laid down here by George Stephenson in 1826. The line&#x27;s gradual closure eventually left only four inclines in use, these finally closing on 4 October 1974.

====Preserved system====
The line, as preserved post-1974, includes two rope-worked inclines. These are the Blackhams Hill East and West inclines. Both are worked by the Blackhams Hill engine, a 300 h.p. Metropolitan Vickers engine commissioned on 30 July 1950. This engine works both the East or Flatt Incline (1,170 yards at a gradient of 1 in 70) and the West or Short Bank (750 yards at a gradient 1 in 13). Over these inclines, the preserved railway demonstrates one of the oldest and most unusual types of railway operation. It is now the only place in Britain where this can be seen. The inclines are not currently operational, however, due to vandalism and decline.

===Locomotives and brake vans===
====Steam locomotives====
* Andrew Barclay W.S.T. Makers Number 2361, built in 1954. Awaiting overhaul; requires new steam pipe and boiler certification. Formerly used at Long Meg Mine and at Cocklakes. British Gypsum signed ownership of the locomotive over to the Bowes Railway Company in September 2008.
* Andrew Barclay No 22 (Number 6 Area B Group 85). Makers number 2274, built in 1949, for use on the Bowes Railway. One of the first locomotives on the Bowes Railway in preservation alongside planet. Currently awaiting overhaul and boiler certification.

====Diesel locomotives====
* Planet No 101. The first locomotive to be used regularly on shunting duties and freight trains when the railway entered preservation. Currently in use.
* Hunslet Engine Company No 6263. Used on freight trains and shunting; the most powerful shunter on the line. Currently out of use needing new brake blocks and a minor overhaul.
* Ruston &amp; Hornsby Class 88 No 476140 &quot;Redheugh&quot;. Restored for use on both passenger and demonstration coal trains. Originally used at Redhaugh gas works. 
* Ruston &amp; Hornsby Class 165 locos &quot;Pinky&quot; (1953) and &quot;Perky&quot; (1954), donated by the Port of Sunderland. They were some of the last operating industrial locomotives in County Durham. Perky is currently operational, Pinky under overhaul.

====Passenger stock====
* Lambton Hetton &amp; Joicey Collieries Brake van No 1. In use.
* L.M.S. No 2, built for use in Derby. In use.
* L.M.S. No 3 Brake van. Awaiting repairs. 
* B24 - The Queen Mother&#x27;s wagon. Awaiting repairs and fitting of handrails.

Wagons

The railway also has a fleet of 45 original Bowes Railway wagons dating from 1887 through to 1963, as well as seven similar wagons from other industrial sites in the North East.

<text>The Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway (BWLR) is located near the villages of Wormshill and Bredgar in Kent, just south of Sittingbourne. It is a narrow gauge railway about in length.

The BWLR is a private line which has been built up as a hobby by a group of friends since the early 1970s. It is a fully operational line, operated to a high standard, with a station, engine sheds and workshops at Warren Wood station and a smaller station at the other end of the line, known as Stony Shaw.

The line is open to the public on the first Sunday of each month and most Wednesdays throughout the summer to raise money to maintain and manage the collection. On event days a number of other attractions are on display including a model railway, a Dutch street organ, a traction engine a steam roller, a Victorian beam engine, an American fire department Ladder truck and a range of old tractors and cars.

The Tearoom is open Wednesday to Sunday (9:00–15:00) throughout the year offering a selection of teas, coffees, cakes, sandwiches snacks and lunches.

The railway appeared briefly in a segment filmed for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Kitchen&quot; programme which aired on 18 June 2011.

<doc id="1157304" wikidata="Q83281" url="?curid=1157304" title="Ranjitkar">
<text>Ranjitkar (रञ्जितकार a.k.a. Chhipaa or Ranjit) is one of the castes of Newar. The Newari caste system is divided according to profession. The Ranjitkar caste is concerned with the dyeing of clothes as well as other color related activities.
The word &quot;Ranjitkar&quot; comes from Sanskrit origins crudely meaning &quot;people concerned with colors&quot; whereas the word &quot;Chhipaa&quot; is a Nepal Bhasa compound word which can be roughly translated as &quot;color and allow to dry&quot;.

== History ==
There are very few written historic documents on Ranjitkars. However, judging by the extravagant clothing that are seen in the sculptures, one can speculate that Ranjitkars or some other people were present in the Nepal during the Licchavi era by latest.
The first mention of Ranjitkars in written history might have been during the declaration of the division of castes by Jayasthiti Malla.

== Race==
Ethnically, Ranjitkars like other Newar communities are of diverse origin including but not limited to various Indic and Tibeto-Burman tribes. They have features resembling both Tibeto Burman and Aryans. So, one may infer that Ranjitkars are heterogeneous groups rather that a kin or ethnically homogeneous group.

== Religion ==
Like all Newās, Ranjitkars follow a syncretic Hindu-Buddhist religion. The priest of Ranjitkars are Bajrachharyas who are Buddhists. However, most of the rituals performed are Hindu. Recently, an emergence of Theravada Buddhism has been observed in the Ranjitkars especially amongst those in Kathmandu.

== Language==
Nepal Bhasa is the native tongue of the Ranjitkars. Nowadays many youngsters use the Nepali language as well.

== Location==
There are three main localities of Ranjitkars in Kathmandu valley. They are in Majipā (मजिपा) of Yen (Downtown Kathmandu), a locality in Yala (Patan) and Golmadi in Bhaktapur. Besides these, Ranjitkars have settlements in Kirtipur, Hetaunda, Bhimphedi, Madhyapur, Dhulikhel, Banepa, Trishuli, Balaju,Mahalaxmi and other cities of Nepal. With modernization and migration, many Ranjitkars have migrated and settled in different parts of the globe.

== Festivals ==
Ranjitkars celebrate almost all of the festivals of Newars. The major festivals which celebrated by the community are as follows:

=== Majipa Lakhey Dance ===
Majipa Lakhey (Lakhey Aaju, Devnagari: मजिपा लाखे, लाखे आजु) is a special Lakhey. He is also known as the peaceful Bhairav. The dance of this lakhey takes place only in the week of full moon of Yenlaa month of Nepal Sambat during Kumari Jatra which is the biggest religious street festival in Kathmandu, Nepal. This lakhey is considered to be the protector of the children. The dance is especially conducted by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu. The dress and mask of the Majipa Lakhey are kept in Majipa Lakhey Chhen (Home).

=== Baalaa Charhe ===
Also known as Baalaa Chaturdashi, it is celebrated according to lunar calendar. The festival is primarily centered in Yen(Kathmandu). It is a festival revering the deitified female ancestor called Ajima (from Newari Aji=grandmother, Ma=Mother). A guthi of Baakunani actively participates in the jatra held on the day.

=== Yenya Punhi ===
Yenya Punhi is celebrated on the full moon day of Yenla month of the Nepali calendar. Also known as Indra Jatra, it is one of the greatest festival of Yen. Majipa Lakhe dance is one of the main attractions of the jatra. Majipa Lakhey is considered as the calm Bhairab who protects children from evils and demons. A guthi in Lakhenani organises the dance which takes place for a week. Majipa Lakhey Deity is one of the most popular symbol of Nepalese culture and religion.

=== Buddha Jayanti ===
The day marks the birth, enlightenment and nirvana of Gautama Buddha.

== Lifestyle==
With the Independence of India, annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and fall of Rana regime in Nepal, the traditional lifestyle breathed its last and made way for new Nepal. The traditional designated dye related work became non-viable due to open market of Nepal which allowed open inflow of refined fabrics and dyed products. So, most of the Ranjitkars have given up the traditional profession. However, some have &quot;evolved&quot; their profession by working as experts for the Royals of Nepal. These people blend the valuable metals into the clothes as well as maintain and repair Shreepech (crown of Nepal).

In the last six decades, Ranjitkars have evolved as one of the literate castes of Nepal. Ranjitkars have thus been contributing in almost every walk of Nepalese society as educated professionals.

<text>The Eastern Shore of Maryland is a part of the U.S. state of Maryland that lies mostly on the east side of the Chesapeake Bay. Nine counties are normally included in the region. The Eastern Shore is part of the larger Delmarva Peninsula that Maryland shares with Delaware and Virginia.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 456,815, with about 7% of Marylanders living in the region. The region is politically more conservative than the rest of the state, generally returning more votes for Republicans than Democrats in statewide and national elections.

Developed in the colonial and federal period for agriculture, the Eastern Shore has remained a relatively rural region. Salisbury is the most populous community on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The region&#x27;s economy is dominated by three industry sectors: fishing along the coasts, especially for shellfish such as the blue crab; farming, especially large-scale chicken farms; and tourism, especially centered on the Atlantic coast and beach resort of Ocean City. 
Because of its coastal and low-lying geography, the region is vulnerable to extreme weather events, including hurricanes and larger environmental issues like climate change and rising sea levels.

The region contains a few major roads; the main connection to the other parts of Maryland is the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 301. U.S. Route 13 connects the southern part of the Eastern Shore to both Delaware and points north and Virginia and points south.

==Geography==

The Eastern Shore of Maryland comprises Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester counties. These lie on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River, which is the western border of Cecil County with Harford County. The region borders the Mason–Dixon line with Delaware to the east and north, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore on the south. Maryland&#x27;s and Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shores, along with most of Delaware, form the Delmarva Peninsula.

The location of the southern border with Virginia was a cause for significant dispute amongst colonists prior to 1668, when Phillip Calvert of Maryland and Edmund Scarborough of Virginia demarcated the Calvert-Scarborough Line. This line ran northeast from Watkins Point in the Chesapeake through the James L. Horsey Farm and beyond to the Atlantic, but was ultimately never observed due to poor marking. The line in use today was established under the Award of 1877; this line travels east from Watkins Point, then up the middle of the Pocomoke River before heading due east along the Calvert-Scarborough Line at the point where it intersects the river.

Like New Castle County, Delaware, Cecil County is crossed by the Fall Line, a geologic division where the rockier highlands of the Piedmont region meet the Atlantic coastal plain, a flat, sandy area that forms the coast. The coastal plain includes the Delmarva Peninsula and hence the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The geology of Delmarva is an inseparable part of the Eastern Shore, which has few rocky outcrops south of Kent County.

The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal crosses from Back Creek on the Elk River to Port Penn, Delaware. While it was a shallow canal with locks after its construction in 1829, it was deepened in the early 20th century to sea level, and physically separates the Delmarva Peninsula from the rest of the United States. Maryland south of the canal is considered the Eastern Shore by residents. The term &quot;Western Shore&quot; is used by Eastern Shore residents to describe all the counties of Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay, but especially those of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and Southern Maryland.

The north–south section of the Mason–Dixon line forms the border between Maryland and Delaware. The border was originally marked every mile by a stone, and every five miles by a &quot;crownstone&quot;. The line is not quite due north and south, but is as straight as survey methods of the 1760s could make it. It was surveyed as a compromise solution to a century-long wrangle over colonial territory between the Penn and Calvert families of England. If the Chesapeake Bay/Delaware Bay watershed divide had been taken as the borderline, the state of Delaware would be about half its current size.

==History==
===Early history===
William Claiborne was granted land that was then part of the Colony of Virginia in 1629. He named it &quot;Kent County&quot;. In 1631, he sailed north up the Chesapeake Bay from its south and west side to the area known today as Kent Island. There he made a fortified settlement that is considered to be the first English settlement within the Province of Maryland. Talbot County was formed in 1662. Cecil County was formed in 1674, by proclamation of the Governor, from eastern portions of Baltimore County and the northern portion of Kent County. Wicomico County was formed in 1867, as the 9th and last county, created from Somerset and Worcester counties.

====Formation of counties====
*1642 Kent County - In 1642, the governor and council appointed commissioners for the Isle and County of Kent. This act appears to have led to the establishment of Kent County, named after the county of Kent in England.
*1661 Talbot County - named for Lady Grace Talbot, the wife of Sir Robert Talbot, an Irish statesman, and the sister of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore.
*1666 Somerset County - named for Mary, Lady Somerset, the wife of Sir John Somerset and daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour.
*1669 Dorchester County - Named for the Earl of Dorset, a family friend of the Calverts (the founding family of the Maryland colony). Dorchester is the County Town of Dorset in England.
*1674 Cecil County.
*1706 Queen Anne&#x27;s County - formed from northern parts of Talbot and southern portions of Kent. Name after Queen Anne of Great Britain who reigned when the county was established.
*1742 Worcester County - named for the Earl of Worcester.
*1773 Caroline County - formed from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne&#x27;s counties. The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland&#x27;s last colonial governor of the Province of Maryland, Robert Eden.
*1867 Wicomico County.

===19th century===
Ocean City was founded on July 4, 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened on Assateague Island. At the time, Assateague Island was continuous from the Delaware state line to well south of Ocean City: the Ocean City Inlet was not formed until a hurricane in August 1933 cut across the south end of the town. The inlet was cut not by waves sweeping inland, but by 4 or 5 days&#x27; worth of freshwater runoff from the coastal creeks running seaward. By 1935, government money had built jetties to make the inlet permanent, dividing Fenwick Island (north) from Assateague Island (south). Early transportation to the island was by train.

Until the 1820s, travel and commerce between the Eastern Shore and Baltimore were less important than the connections between it and Philadelphia. Water travel by sailboat and steamer linked the Eastern Shore to Baltimore more tightly beginning about 1813, when the first steamboat traveled the Bay. By the 1880s, railroad lines linked the Eastern Shore to Philadelphia and later, Norfolk, Virginia, by way of a railroad line straight south from Wilmington to Dover, Delmar, Salisbury, and Cape Charles. Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore was served by branch lines running generally southwest from the main route. See List of railroad lines in the Delmarva Peninsula. The Eastern Shore&#x27;s many branchlines were built after the Civil War by local companies; by the late nineteenth century, all were controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (which also bought control of the steamboat and ferry routes), then Conrail and Norfolk Southern. Today the remaining active railroad tracks on the Eastern Shore are operated by short-line railroads Delmarva Central Railroad and the Maryland and Delaware Railroad.

Commercial east–west ties between Delaware towns and Maryland towns were culturally significant in Colonial and Early American periods despite the border line, which largely cut through woods and swamps. Trade with Philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to Delaware towns such as Odessa (then called Cantwell&#x27;s Bridge) and Smyrna, then called Duck Creek. Agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the Delaware River by &quot;shallop men&quot; in small vessels called shallops. These cultural connections continue to this day.

===20th and 21st centuries===
An east–west rail route ran from a ferry terminal at Claiborne, west of St. Michaels, to Ocean City, via the Baltimore and Eastern Shore Railroad and the Wicomico and Pocomoke Railroad. Travelers could also take a ferry to Love Point on Kent Island, board a Queen Anne&#x27;s Railroad train, and travel east to Lewes and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

Automobile transportation across the Chesapeake Bay was by ferryboat until 1952, when the first Chesapeake Bay Bridge was opened for traffic.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, developers began selling lots on Assateague Island, south of the inlet. However, a storm on March 6, 1962 destroyed houses, shacks, and roads. The state and federal governments intervened before reconstruction by creating the Assateague Island National Seashore and Assateague State Park to preserve this area rather than have it be developed.

An Eastern Shore Baseball League operated during three periods between 1922 and 1949. It was a Class D minor league with teams in all three states of Delmarva.

==Demographics==
Although the Eastern Shore comprises a large part of Maryland&#x27;s land area, it had a population of 456,815 as of the 2020 Census, representing about 7.4% of Maryland&#x27;s total population. The most populous city in the region is Salisbury, and the most populous county is Cecil.

==Elections==
The Eastern Shore is considerably more conservative than the more densely populated and urban Western Shore. Since the late 20th century, when conservative whites shifted to the Republican Party, the region has strongly supported Republican candidates for governor. The three Republican nominees for governor from 1994 to 2018 –Ellen Sauerbrey, Bob Ehrlich, and Larry Hogan– swept all nine counties. This streak ended in 2022 when Democrat Wes Moore won Kent and Talbot counties, though Republican Dan Cox still won the Eastern Shore overall.

At the presidential level, the Eastern Shore also leans Republican. But Kent and Somerset counties have flipped back and forth in supporting Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. The last Democrat to win Dorchester County was Bill Clinton from Arkansas in 1996. Cecil County has not gone Democratic since Jimmy Carter from Georgia won the county in 1976. Queen Anne&#x27;s, Caroline, Wicomico, and Worcester counties have voted Republican at every election subsequent to Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide. Up until 2020, this was true for Talbot County as well, but it was won by Joe Biden.

The Eastern Shore has long been a part of Maryland&#x27;s 1st Congressional district. Democrat Roy Dyson represented the 1st district from 1981 until 1990, when he was defeated by Republican Wayne Gilchrest. Gilchrest held the seat until 2008, when State Senator Andy Harris defeated him in the Republican primary. Harris narrowly lost the subsequent general election to Democrat Frank Kratovil, Queen Anne&#x27;s County state&#x27;s attorney. In 2010, Harris again ran for the district and handily defeated Kratovil after a single term in office. Harris has held the seat without serious difficulty since.

In the Maryland General Assembly, the Eastern Shore encompasses a portion of district 35B and all of districts 35A, 36, 37A and 37B, 38A, 38B and 38C. All seats are held by Republicans except for a state delegate seat in district 37A.


==Economy==
===Tourism===

Ocean City&#x27;s skyline, containing tall hotels and condominiums, stands out within Delmarva. At the southern end of the town, a recreational boardwalk spans over thirty blocks, containing carnival rides and games, restaurants, bars, arcades, and clothing boutiques.

Tourists visit St. Michaels on a neck surrounded by water; the colonial former port of Oxford; Chestertown; and isolated Smith Island in the Chesapeake Bay. North of Crisfield is Janes Island State Park, with camping and kayaking trails through marshlands. Cambridge continues to be a popular destination for tourism because of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, the Hyatt Chesapeake Bay Resort, Spa &amp; Marina, and the Harriet Tubman National Park.

===Fishing===

At the southern end of the Chesapeake coast of Maryland, the town of Crisfield is home to a fishing, crabbing, and seafood processing industry.

===Agriculture===

In the 21st century, the main economic activities on the Eastern Shore are vegetable and grain farming, seafood, large-scale chicken breeding (Perdue Farms was founded in Salisbury and is still headquartered there today), and tourism. Tobacco was the chief commodity crop during colonial times. The agricultural economy switched to mixed products, including grain, in the second half of the 18th century.

=== Energy ===

Energy in the Eastern shore is provided by five oil and natural gas plants.

====Pipeline====
==Environment==

As part of the broader Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Eastern Shore confronts common environmental issues of the watershed, such as nutrient runoff from agriculture, but it is also vulnerable to climate change.

Because of its low-lying geography and sandy soil, the region is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and salt water intrusion. Moreover, because of the coastal geography, infrastructure is already being damaged both due to sea level rise, and storm surge from tropical storms and hurricanes.

The Eastern Shore&#x27;s economy depends on the larger fisheries and farming, both of which are sensitive to climate change.

==Transportation==

Various waterways provide a medium for commerce and boaters: the Atlantic Ocean, Chesapeake Bay, the Susquehanna River, and the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.

There are three major routes to the Eastern Shore:
*The Chesapeake Bay Bridge spans of the Chesapeake Bay, and at the time of construction in 1952, was the longest continuous over-water steel structure. A second parallel span was added in 1973 and a third has been discussed, most recently in 2006. A third span would not open, according to state officials, until about 2025. The bridges have eased commuting to larger cities. Kent Island, site of the first English settlement on the Shore, has become a bedroom community for Washington, DC; Annapolis, and Baltimore. Kent Island is part of Queen Anne&#x27;s County.
*U.S. Route 13
*Maryland Route 213

The two major highways on the Eastern Shore are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 50, which meet in Salisbury.

===Airports===
Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport, in Salisbury, is the only commercial airport on the Delmarva Peninsula.

Airports for private aircraft include:
*Bay Bridge Airport in Stevensville
*Cambridge-Dorchester Airport in Cambridge
*Crisfield Municipal Airport in Crisfield.
*Easton Airport, in Easton
*Ocean City Municipal Airport in Ocean City

==Secession==
The Eastern Shore has made several attempts to separate from Maryland. Proposals were debated in Maryland&#x27;s General Assembly in 1833–1835, 1852, and 1998. There were earlier proposals visualizing a state encompassing the Delmarva Peninsula. The 1998 proposal by state Senators Richard F. Colburn and J. Lowell Stoltzfus did not specify a status for Eastern Shore&#x27;s nine counties following secession, but suggested the new state&#x27;s name could be &quot;Delmarva&quot;.

==Sports==

The Delmarva Shorebirds are a minor league baseball team who play Class A baseball in the Carolina League at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium in Salisbury, affiliated with the Baltimore Orioles.

<text>Lewes Castle is a medieval castle in the town of Lewes in East Sussex, England. Originally called Bray Castle, it occupies a commanding position guarding the gap in the South Downs cut by the River Ouse and occupied by the towns of Lewes and Cliffe. It stands on a man-made mount just to the north of the high street in Lewes, and is constructed from local limestone and flint blocks.

==History==

The castle follows a motte and bailey design but, unusually, it has two mottes, and the only other castle in England to have that structure is Lincoln Castle.

The first motte, known as Brack Mount, was completed shortly after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and the second motte, known as the Keep, was completed in the late 11th century. Both mottes were built by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. The mottes would originally have been surmounted by wooden palisades but these were replaced with masonry shell keeps at the start of the 12th century. The bailey area also had a stone wall with towers.

Soldiers left the castle to engage with Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Lewes in 1264.

Towers were added to one of the shell keeps in the 13th century and a barbican gate was added in the 14th century. When the last of the de Warennes, John, the 7th Earl, died without issue in 1347, he was buried in Lewes Priory. His title passed to his nephew Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel.

The castle was leased by Sussex Archaeological Society from 1850, and was acquired by Charles Thomas-Stanford and gifted to the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1922.

===Wall collapse===
On 11 November 2019 at 12:22 GMT the first alert was raised that a 10m by 10m section of the curtain wall had collapsed onto an adjacent house and garden. Emergency services searched the site but found no casualties. Sussex Archaeological Society said that the collapsed wall was privately owned and one of the last parts of the curtain wall. They also said that the parts owned by the society were checked independently on an annual basis. The castle was closed as a precaution. The wall was described in a contemporaneous news report as weighing 600 tonnes.

<text>&quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; is the tenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Meyer Dolinsky and directed by David Alexander, it was first broadcast on November 22, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounter an ageless and sadistic race of humanoids with the power of telekinesis.

The episode is notable for depicting a kiss between a white man (Kirk) and a black woman (Uhura), which was among the earliest instances of this on a US television show.

It was one of several episodes not screened by the BBC because of their &quot;unpleasant&quot; content, including torture and sadism.

==Plot==
Captain Kirk, along with First Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, beams down to a planet to investigate a distress call. Once there, they are greeted by a friendly little person named Alexander (Michael Dunn). He leads the landing party to meet the rest of his people, who have adopted classical Greek culture, and named themselves Platonians in honor of the Greek philosopher Plato.

All of the Platonians, except for Alexander, possess telekinetic powers, and the planet&#x27;s ruling class have become exceedingly arrogant as a result, believing they can do as they please because of their powers. The Platonians explain they &quot;lured&quot; the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to their planet because their leader, Parmen, requires medical help. After being treated by Dr. McCoy, Parmen demands McCoy remain on the planet to treat other Platonians. When Captain Kirk objects, the Platonians use their powers to punish him.

Alexander tries to tell Kirk and Spock that Parmen wishes to kill them but is afraid.

Parmen repeatedly humiliates Kirk and Spock as Dr. McCoy watches, trying to make him agree to stay on the planet. Later, the Platonians use their powers to force two other &quot;Enterprise&quot; officers to the planet for their entertainment: Communications Officer Lt. Uhura and Nurse Chapel.

McCoy takes a sample of Alexander&#x27;s blood and manages to isolate and identify the kironide mineral that provides the inhabitants with their special powers; it is abundant in the natural food and water supply of the planet. McCoy is able to prepare a serum and inject Kirk and Spock with doses to make them have twice the power of Parmen. (He observes that Alexander&#x27;s lack of pituitary growth hormone makes him unable to metabolize the kironide and gain the telekinetic ability. Alexander declares that he would not want the ability anyway; he would not want to risk becoming like the Platonians.)
Alexander asks where Kirk comes from, and if size matters there. Kirk says size, color, and species do not matter. Alexander asks to go with Kirk.

While Kirk and the others are waiting for the serum to take effect, Parmen forces the four, all dressed in Greek clothing, to perform again. Alexander becomes angry after watching the humiliating tricks played upon the crew by his fellow Platonians, and he tries, unsuccessfully, to attack Parmen with a knife.

Kirk uses his new-found telekinetic powers to defeat Parmen and save Alexander&#x27;s life. Parmen then promises to mend his bullying ways, but Kirk doesn&#x27;t believe him, and warns Parmen, should he go back on his word, the powers can be recreated by anyone whenever they wish to defeat him.

Kirk promises to send appropriate medical technicians to the planet as long as the Platonians behave themselves, and Alexander requests to go with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to start a new life elsewhere in the galaxy.

With Alexander by his side, Kirk contacts the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and tells Scotty, &quot;I have a little surprise for you. I&#x27;m bringing a visitor aboard.&quot;

==The kiss==

The episode features a kiss between James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) which for many years was described as the first interracial kiss on television.

However, it was not the first interracial kiss on television.

Several takes of the Kirk/Uhura kiss were filmed, with different levels of contact between the actors, and many speculate on which version was used in the final cut of the episode. William Shatner recalls in &quot;Star Trek Memories&quot; that NBC insisted their lips never touch (the technique of turning their heads away from the camera was used to conceal this). However, Nichelle Nichols insists in her autobiography &quot;Beyond Uhura&quot; (written in 1994 after Shatner&#x27;s book) that the kiss was real, even in takes where her head obscures their lips.

When NBC executives learned of the kiss they became concerned it would anger TV stations in the Deep South. There were, however, few if any complaints about the scene. Nichelle Nichols observes that &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; which first aired in November 1968 &quot;received a huge response. We received one of the largest batches of fan mail ever, all of it very positive, with many addressed to me from girls wondering how it felt to kiss Captain Kirk, and many to him from guys wondering the same thing about me. However, almost no one found the kiss offensive&quot; except from a single, mildly negative letter from one white Southerner who wrote: &quot;I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain&#x27;t gonna fight it.&quot; Nichols notes that &quot;for me, the most memorable episode of our last season was &#x27;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren.&#x27;&quot;

==Reception==

It was one of several episodes not screened by the BBC because of their &quot;unpleasant&quot; content, including torture and sadism. (The other episodes that were censored in this way were &quot;The Empath&quot;, &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot; and &quot;Miri&quot;.) The U.K. reviewed &quot;Star Trek&quot; in part as a children&#x27;s show and restricted episodes that included several with overt depictions of torture and sexuality they felt were not appropriate for children. For example, Marta&#x27;s dance in &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot; was deemed too sexual for it to be recommended as children&#x27;s viewing material.

In 2009, &quot;Newsweek&quot; pointed out the moral lessons of this episode, in particular Kirk&#x27;s lines to the oppressed alien. The alien is being mistreated on the planet, and is surprised when Kirk informs him about Starfleet standards.

In 2016, &quot;TVLine&quot; ranked this as having one of the top twenty moments of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, noting the scene during which Spock and Kirk are forced to dance by the powerful but cruel aliens.

On the fiftieth anniversary of the first broadcast of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot; noted the Kirk-Uhura kiss as &quot;iconic&quot;, which they describe as connecting to the period&#x27;s civil rights issues.

In 2016, &quot;Radio Times&quot; ranked the kiss between Uhura and Kirk as the 25th best moment in all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2016, SyFy noted this episode for actress Nichelle Nichols presentation of Uhura, as having her best scene in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

William Shatner, in his 1993 memoir &quot;Star Trek Memories&quot;, says that aside from the kiss, this was otherwise &quot;a rather forgettable, rather dull episode.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; the fourth worst episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<doc id="1157329" wikidata="Q1020244" url="?curid=1157329" title="Te Puke">
<text>Te Puke is a town located 18 kilometres southeast of Tauranga in the Western Bay of Plenty of New Zealand. It is particularly well known for the cultivation of Kiwifruit.

Te Puke is close to Tauranga and Maketu, which are both coastal towns/cities, as well as the small townships of Waitangi, Manoeka, Pongakawa, and Paengaroa. The Tauranga Eastern Link, completed in 2015, moved State Highway 2 away from Te Puke and removed large volumes of traffic from its streets.

The town&#x27;s name comes from the Māori language, and should be pronounced &quot;teh-pook-ee&quot;, not &quot;te-pyook&quot;. It translates to &quot;the hill&quot;; it is on a hill near the Papamoa Hills.

==Demographics==
Te Puke covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Te Puke had a population of 8,688 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,296 people (17.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,728 people (24.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,793 households, comprising 4,368 males and 4,326 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.01 males per female, with 1,809 people (20.8%) aged under 15 years, 1,893 (21.8%) aged 15 to 29, 3,423 (39.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,569 (18.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 62.2% European/Pākehā, 26.5% Māori, 4.8% Pacific peoples, 19.4% Asian, and 1.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 24.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 42.2% had no religion, 30.9% were Christian, 3.4% had Māori religious beliefs, 2.6% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.9% were Buddhist and 13.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 783 (11.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,638 (23.8%) people had no formal qualifications. 570 people (8.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,363 (48.9%) people were employed full-time, 1,023 (14.9%) were part-time, and 276 (4.0%) were unemployed.

== History and culture ==

=== Settlement ===
Around 1350, the Te Arawa canoe is said to have landed at Maketu after sailing from Hawaiki. The canoe was under the command of chief Tama-te-kapua, and he was responsible for many of the original place names of the area. Māori ventured up the rivers and streams and built many pā in the area.

Lieutenant, later Captain James Cook, the first European known to visit the area, sailed between Mōtītī Island and the coast in 1769. This was his first voyage to New Zealand, but he did not land here. Cook named the area the Bay of Plenty as he observed that it was well populated and looked very fertile. In 1830 Danish sailor Philip Tapsell, also known as Hans Homman Felk, settled at Maketu and operated as a trader. Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries arrived shortly afterwards and established mission stations at Te Papa (Tauranga) and at Rotorua. After the land wars began to ease in the 1860s, European settlers began to move to the Bay of Plenty though not in great numbers.

Maketu, however was a thriving village with a school, post office, and hotel and in 1869 an Anglican church. In 1876, surveying of the Te Puke Block commenced but it was not until 1879 that they survey was completed as the Native Land Court needed to complete their investigation of Māori titles for the land. Demand for land in the Tauranga area increased and the Tauranga Working Men&#x27;s Land Association was formed in 1877. Forty eight members petitioned the government for 4000 acres (16 ha) of the Te Puke block under the deferred-payment system. At the same time George Vesey Stewart applied to the government to bring settlers from Great Britain to the Te Puke Block as he had already successfully done in Katikati.

The first settlers on the Te Puke Block arrived in 1879 and included Peter Grant and his wife Caroline (née Moon), William Bird and his wife Sarah (née Leitch), Joseph Malyon and his wife Sara (née James) amongst others. The first of the Vesey Stewart settlers arrived in Tauranga directly from London on the &quot;Lady Jocelyn&quot; on 2 January 1881.

==Development==
In July 1880, work commenced on the Tauranga to Te Puke Road, via Welcome Bay. It was constructed by the Armed Constabulary and local Māori who worked on their land. Before this, access to Te Puke was made across the Papamoa Hills from Ngapeke to Manoeka, following an ancient Māori trail. Peter Grant had been contracted by the Tauranga County Council to form this track into a bridle path in 1879.

Stores and passengers for the town could also come from Tauranga by boat, first to Maketu, then up the Kaituna River to Canaan Landing and then by Māori canoe up the Waiari Stream to the site of the present road bridge just to the south of the town.

By late 1881, Te Puke boasted 25 wooden buildings including two hotels, two general stores, a butcher, a post office and a smithy. The settlers quickly settled upon the land and by 1884 had established a butter factory. Draining of the swamps began and the area was found to be very suitable for crops, and maize and wheat were grown extensively. Later much of the farming land was found to be &quot;bush sick&quot; but was cured with the use of cobalt in the 1930s.

Flax milling had begun in the 1870s and became a major industry in the area until the early 1940s. Saw milling began in 1905 and is still a major industry in the area. In 1883 gold-bearing ore was discovered on the Papamoa Hills and during the 1920s a gold mine operated at Muir&#x27;s farm on No 4 Road. With the building of the railway a large Public Works quarry operated in Te Puke and was a major employer. The freezing works at Rangiuru opened in 1968 and HortResearch opened on No 1 Road in 1971.

Disaster struck in the early hours of the 10 June 1886 with the eruption of Mount Tarawera. Te Puke residents were awoken with the noise and the many related earthquakes. Many had a good view of the eruption and paintings survive of their memories. Ash and mud showered over crops and pastures up to 12 inches deep in places. The sun was not seen until 1pm.

Stock faced starvation and many farmers were forced to let their animals free to fend for themselves. Some stock was shipped from the area but many died. The settlers became short of food and water themselves and help was gratefully received from Tauranga. Evidence of the Tarawera eruption can still be found in disturbed ground in the area today. (Te Puke was again covered in ash during the 1995 Mount Ruapehu eruption though not to the same scale.)
Te Puke town-ship began to grow and a mission/town hall was built in 1883. This was used for town meetings and as a church by three of the congregations. The first school, (Te Puke Primary) was opened in 1883. The Te Puke Times was first printed in 1912. The fire brigade and town boards were both formed in 1913.

A jockey club was formed in 1890, the brass band in 1903, the A. &amp; P. Society in 1905, the rugby union in 1906, the bowling club in 1908, and the golf club in 1912. Planting of the trees down the centre of the main street, a major feature of the town today, began during 1914–1918 as a war memorial to the fallen. A nursing home was opened in Boucher Avenue in 1918 but any major cases were railed to Tauranga Hospital.

=== Railway ===

The East Coast Main Trunk Railway passes through Te Puke and opened in 1928. Rail passenger services were provided by the Taneatua Express which operated between Auckland and Taneatua between 1928 and 1959. In February 1959, the steam hauled express train service was replaced by a railcar service operated by 88 seaters that only ran as far as Te Puke. The railcar service operated between 1959 and 1967, when it was cancelled due to both mechanical problems with the railcars and poor patronage, the latter largely due to the circuitous and time-consuming rail route between Auckland and the Bay of Plenty at that time.

=== Horticulture ===

A combination of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and it was found that pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6 km2) of land of which was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (tree tomatoes) and feijoas.

In 1934 Jim MacLoughlin had bought a lemon and passionfruit orchard in No 3 Road. His neighbour Vic Bayliss had two Chinese gooseberry plants and he had sold the fruit for £5. Spurred on by this Jim planted ½ acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name “Kiwifruit” was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular. In 1998 “Zespri Gold” kiwifruit was introduced to the market and experiments are being carried out on new varieties including a peelable kiwifruit and &quot;kiwiberry&quot;, a small bite-sized kiwifruit-like fruit.

===Marae===
There are five marae in Te Puke, affiliated with local iwi and hapū:

* Haraki Marae and meeting house are affiliated with Waitaha and the Ngāti Rangiwewehi hapū of Ngāti Rangiwewehi ki Tai.
* Makahae – Te Kahika Marae is affiliated with the Tapuika hapū of Ngāti Tuheke. In October 2020, the Government committed $4,525,104 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and nine others, creating an estimated 34 jobs.
* Manoeka Marae and Hei meeting house are affiliated with Waitaha.
* Moko – Ngāti Moko Marae and the Mokotangatakotahi meeting house are affiliated with the Tapuika hapū of Ngāti Moko.
* Tawakepito Marae and Tawakepito meeting house is affiliated with the Tapuika hapū of Ngāti Tuheke.

==Economy==

Agriculture is the backbone of the district&#x27;s economy. The warm, moist climate and fertile soils are favourable for horticulture, with production of kiwifruit, avocados and citrus fruit such as lemons and oranges. The town markets itself as the &quot;Kiwifruit capital of the world&quot;. Dairy cattle and other livestock are also farmed.

Today, Te Puke is a thriving town with a reasonably large main shopping street, Jellicoe Street, which is also the main road passing through Te Puke. There are a number of schools, religious organisations, cultural groups, and a variety of clubs in the town.

A large number of residents work picking or packing kiwifruit during April or May, as well as others coming from other nearby towns and cities. It can swell past 10,000 some seasons.

==Education==

Te Puke High School is the town&#x27;s co-educational state high school for Year 9 to 13 students, with a roll of as of .

Te Puke has two state primary schools for Year 1 to 6 students: Fairhaven School, with a roll of , and Te Puke Primary School, with a roll of .

It has one state intermediate school for Year 7 to 8 students: Te Puke Intermediate, with a roll of .

<text>Evolutionary medicine or Darwinian medicine is the application of modern evolutionary theory to understanding health and disease. Modern biomedical research and practice have focused on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying health and disease, while evolutionary medicine focuses on the question of why evolution has shaped these mechanisms in ways that may leave us susceptible to disease. The evolutionary approach has driven important advances in the understanding of cancer, autoimmune disease, and anatomy. Medical schools have been slower to integrate evolutionary approaches because of limitations on what can be added to existing medical curricula. The International Society for Evolution, Medicine and Public Health coordinates efforts to develop the field. It owns the Oxford University Press journal &quot;Evolution, Medicine and Public Health&quot; and &quot;The Evolution and Medicine Review&quot;.

== Core principles ==
Utilizing the Delphi method, 56 experts from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, medicine, nursing, and biology agreed upon 14 core principles intrinsic to the education and practice of evolutionary medicine. These 14 principles can be further grouped into five general categories: question framing, evolution I and II (with II involving a higher level of complexity), evolutionary trade-offs, reasons for vulnerability, and culture. Additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below.
==Human adaptations==
Adaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and trade-offs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition.

===Constraints===
Adaptations can only occur if they are evolvable. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible.
* DNA cannot be totally prevented from undergoing somatic replication corruption; this has meant that cancer, which is caused by somatic mutations, has not (so far) been eliminated by natural selection.
* Humans cannot biosynthesize vitamin C, and so risk scurvy, vitamin C deficiency disease, if dietary intake of the vitamin is insufficient.
* Retinal neurons and their axon output have evolved to be inside the layer of retinal pigment cells. This creates a constraint on the evolution of the visual system such that the optic nerve is forced to exit the retina through a point called the optic disc. This, in turn, creates a blind spot. More importantly, it makes vision vulnerable to increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) since this cups and damages the optic nerve at this point, resulting in impaired vision.
Other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations.

===Trade-offs and conflicts===
One constraint upon selection is that different adaptations can conflict, which requires a compromise between them to ensure an optimal cost-benefit tradeoff.
* Running efficiency in women, and birth canal size
* Encephalization, and gut size 
* Skin pigmentation protection from UV, and the skin synthesis of vitamin D
* Speech and its use of a descended larynx, and increased risk of choking

===Competition effects===
Different forms of competition exist and these can shape the processes of genetic change.
* mate choice and disease susceptibility
* genomic conflict between mother and fetus that results in pre-eclampsia

==Lifestyle==
Humans evolved to live as simple hunter-gatherers in small tribal bands, while contemporary humans have a more complex life. This change may make present-day humans susceptible to lifestyle diseases.

===Diet===
In contrast to the diet of early hunter-gatherers, the modern Western diet often contains high quantities of fat, salt, and simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours.
* Trans fat health risks
* Dental caries
* High GI foods
* Modern diet based on &quot;common wisdom&quot; regarding diets in the paleolithic era

Among different countries, the incidence of colon cancer varies widely, and the extent of exposure to a Western pattern diet may be a factor in cancer incidence.

===Life expectancy===

Examples of aging-associated diseases are atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with aging (increases exponentially with age, in the case of cancer). 
Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.

===Exercise===
Many contemporary humans engage in little physical exercise compared to the physically active lifestyles of ancestral hunter-gatherers. Prolonged periods of inactivity may have only occurred in early humans following illness or injury, so a modern sedentary lifestyle may continuously cue the body to trigger life preserving metabolic and stress-related responses such as inflammation, and some theorize that this causes chronic diseases.

===Cleanliness===

Contemporary humans in developed countries are mostly free of parasites, particularly intestinal ones. This is largely due to frequent washing of clothing and the body, and improved sanitation. Although such hygiene can be very important when it comes to maintaining good health, it can be problematic for the proper development of the immune system. The hygiene hypothesis is that humans evolved to be dependent on certain microorganisms that help establish the immune system, and modern hygiene practices can prevent necessary exposure to these microorganisms. &quot;Microorganisms and macroorganisms such as helminths from mud, animals, and feces play a critical role in driving immunoregulation&quot; (Rook, 2012). Essential microorganisms play a crucial role in building and training immune functions that fight off and repel some diseases, and protect against excessive inflammation, which has been implicated in several diseases. For instance, recent studies have found evidence supporting inflammation as a contributing factor in Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.

==Evolutionary psychology==
As noted in the table below, adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies with evolutionary perspectives on medicine and physiological dysfunctions (see in particular, Randy Nesse and George C. Williams&#x27; book &quot;Why We Get Sick&quot;).
Evolutionary psychiatrists and psychologists suggest that some mental disorders likely have multiple causes.

See several topic areas, and the associated references, below.
* Agoraphobia
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Drug abuse
* Schizophrenia
* Unhappiness
==History==

Charles Darwin did not discuss the implications of his work for medicine, though biologists quickly appreciated the germ theory of disease and its implications for understanding the evolution of pathogens, as well as an organism&#x27;s need to defend against them.

Medicine, in turn, ignored evolution, and instead focused (as done in the hard sciences) upon proximate mechanical causes.

George C. Williams was the first to apply evolutionary theory to health in the context of senescence. Also in the 1950s, John Bowlby approached the problem of disturbed child development from an evolutionary perspective upon attachment.

An important theoretical development was Nikolaas Tinbergen&#x27;s distinction made originally in ethology between evolutionary and proximate mechanisms.

Randolph M. Nesse summarizes its relevance to medicine: 

The paper of Paul Ewald in 1980, &quot;Evolutionary Biology and the Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Infectious Disease&quot;, and that of Williams and Nesse in 1991, &quot;The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine&quot; were key developments. The latter paper &quot;draw a favorable reception&quot;,page x and led to a book, &quot;Why We Get Sick&quot; (published as &quot;Evolution and healing&quot; in the UK). In 2008, an online journal started: &quot;Evolution and Medicine Review&quot;.

In 2000, Paul Sherman hypothesised that morning sickness could be an adaptation that protects the developing fetus from foodborne illnesses, some of which can cause miscarriage or birth defects, such as listeriosis and toxoplasmosis.

<text>The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway is a preserved standard gauge heritage railway with its headquarters and main station at Chinnor in South Oxfordshire, England. It runs along the foot of the Chilterns escarpment. Although a little distance away, it has since been given the nickname &#x27;The Icknield Line&#x27; for its connection to the Lower Icknield Way.

== History ==
The line was part of the former Great Western Railway branch line between Watlington and Princes Risborough. British Railways closed the line to passenger traffic in 1957. The section between Chinnor and Princes Risborough thereafter carried a freight-only cement service until 1989.

== Preservation ==

===Reopening===
The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway Association was formed around August 1989. On 19 May 1991, the first traina works train headed by a 0-4-0 Baguley dieselran from Chinnor. It began to operate passenger trains between Chinnor and the site of the former Wainhill Halt (about 1 km NE of Chinnor) in August 1994. In 1995, the route was extended by about 3 km to Horsenden Lane, and then to the old rail connection that led trains to Oxford now known as Thame Junction in 1996. On 21 February 2016, the railway was connected to the main line at Princes Risborough, with services commencing later that year running in to a siding adjacent to Platform 4 at Princes Risborough while works were being undertaken to rebuild the platform there. Some service trains were not always able to run that far either due to Network Rail / Chiltern Railways requirements or other works related to platform reinstatement and continued to terminate at Thame Junction.

The railway now operates between Chinnor and platform 4 at Princes Risborough, although some services may continue to terminate and turn around at Thame Junction for operational reasons. There is no platform at Thame Junction. Work to reinstate platform 4 at Princes Risborough was completed in August 2018.

===Princes Risborough extension===
Following discussions with Network Rail, an extension of about a mile (1.5 km) to Princes Risborough main line railway station was undertaken, with a view to running into Princes Risborough station. This would allow passengers to connect from Chiltern Railways services on the Chiltern Main Line. Previously, the line was reconnected at a point just yards from the head shunt at Thame Junction for special events to allow trains to run into Princes Risborough station: in October 2013, the line was reconnected for the first 3 weekends for the Railway&#x27;s &quot;Haversham &amp; Friends&quot; celebrations, and the first through-train for 57 years, a rail tour from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough, ran on 5 October 2013.

On 21 February 2016, a small team of volunteers used a road-rail vehicle to install a track panel in place of a Network Rail buffer stop to reinstate the physical connection to Princes Risborough; the following day, official boundary gates and safety signage were installed, making the line operational. With the extension in place, the line is in length. The link was used for the first time by a visiting locomotive as part of the diesel gala held on 4/5 June 2016; DB Cargo Class 66 66185 hauled 3-CEP 411198 on the 0950 from Chinnor. A test run with a single-car DMU was operated on 25 June with the train running into Princes Risborough&#x27;s temporary platform 4, followed a week later by a Class 17 working and then a steam-run on 10 July. The first full public service carrying VIP guests to Risborough ran on 23 July, hauled by D3018 Haversham with the return journey worked by GWR 0-6-0PT 5786 (L.92).

Bay platform 4 of the original Watlington branch has been reconstructed at Princes Risborough by the preserved railway using, where possible, materials recovered from the site; with that work completed, Chinnor &amp; Princes Risborough Railway passengers are now able to join or leave trains at Princes Risborough on certain services. The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway held an official opening ceremony of the Platform on 15 August 2018. 

===Future projects===
Extending the line to the south-west from Chinnor towards near the A40, taking its total length to .

A purpose built Maintenance and Education centre at a site some 200 yards south of Chinnor station has been opened.

The railway is currently constructing a new independent line which will allow trains to run into Princes Risborough without having to use the Network Rail-owned line. 

==On-screen appearances==
Chinnor station has been used for the filming of various TV series including &quot;Miss Marple&quot; and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;.

<text>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA ), commonly referred to as Metro, is a tri-jurisdictional public transit agency operates transit service in the Washington metropolitan area. WMATA provides rapid transit service under the Metrorail name, fixed-route bus service under the Metrobus brand, and paratransit service under the MetroAccess brand. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The agency participates in regional transportation planning and the execution of transit infrastructure projects. Recent projects include an infill station serving Potomac Yard and an extension of Metrorail to Dulles International Airport.

WMATA was created in the late 1960s by the United States Congress as an interstate compact between Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. The authority&#x27;s board of directors consists of two voting representatives each from the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and the U.S. federal government. Each jurisdiction also appoints two alternate representatives. WMATA has no independent taxation authority and depends on its member jurisdictions for capital investments and operating funding.

WMATA has its own police force, the Metro Transit Police Department.

==History==

=== Planning and creation ===
Starting in the mid-19th century, the Washington area had been served by a variety of private bus lines and streetcar services, including extensions of Northern Virginia trolleys. Over time, most were absorbed into the Capital Transit Company, formed on December 1, 1933, by the amalgamation of the Washington Railway and Electric Company, Capital Traction, and the Washington Rapid Transit bus company. Financier Louis Wolfson acquired the company in 1949 but had his franchise revoked in 1955 amid a crippling strike. Congress then awarded a 20-year concession to O. Roy Chalk on the condition that he replace the city&#x27;s remaining streetcars with buses by 1963. The company was thereafter known as D.C. Transit.

Also in 1955, the Mass Transportation Survey began to plan highway and mass transit systems that would meet the needs of the Washington area in 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report called for the construction of two rapid transit subway lines in downtown Washington. Congress responded to the report by enacting the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960, which created the federal National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA) to coordinate transportation planning for the area. The report also called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, but residents successfully lobbied for a moratorium on freeway construction in what became part of a movement called the &quot;freeway revolts.&quot;

The NCTA&#x27;s November 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report proposed an 89-mile (143 km) rail system that would cost $793 million, less than the 1959 plan because several controversial freeways were removed. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only within the District of Columbia. However, that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy&#x27;s death. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban mass transportation projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a rapid transit system.

The NCTA negotiated with Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia to form a new regional entity. The authority was created by an interstate compact, a special type of contract or agreement between one or more states. Pursuant to the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution, any such compact must be approved by Congress. After the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact was approved by the Maryland General Assembly in 1965, and passed through the Virginia General Assembly and Congress in 1966, WMATA was founded on February 20, 1967.

As a government agency, the compact grants WMATA sovereign immunity by all three jurisdictions in which it operates, and except for certain limited exceptions, the authority cannot be successfully sued unless it waives immunity. Under the provisions of the compact, the authority is legally incorporated in the District of Columbia, where WMATA maintains its headquarters.

=== Metro construction and operation ===

WMATA broke ground for its train system in 1969. The first portion of the Metrorail system opened March 27, 1976, connecting Farragut North to Rhode Island Avenue on the Red Line. The of the original 83-station system was completed on January 13, 2001, with the opening of Green Line&#x27;s segment from Anacostia to Branch Avenue.

WMATA&#x27;s bus system is a successor to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA&#x27;s original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned D.C. Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George&#x27;s County for $4.5 million. While AB&amp;W and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than D.C. Transit, their owners did not wish to compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested a takeover.

In 1979, an organization known as Metro 2001, Inc., planned to write a history of the development of the Metro system for WMATA using such documents as Congressional hearing transcripts, correspondence, and maps. This Metro History Project was abandoned in 1985, and materials that had been collected up until that point (1930-1984) were donated to George Washington University. As of 2018, this collection of materials was under the care of GWU&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.

In 1998, Congress changed the name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, though the law did not allocate money to implement the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change the name of the National Airport station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only at the request of the local jurisdiction. Since both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Finally, in 2001, Congress made changing the station&#x27;s name a condition of further federal funding.

===Impacts of the Great Recession===

In response to a demand for immediate repayment of a $43 million debt, WMATA sought a temporary restraining order against the KBC Bank Group. KBC claimed that the WMATA was in technical default of a contract following the collapse of American International Group, which had guaranteed the loan that KBC made to WMATA in 2002. The contract involved the sale to KBC of WMATA&#x27;s rail cars, which were then leased back to WMATA. The transit agency asked for an injunction from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 29, 2008.

After three days of negotiations in federal court, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer announced a settlement on November 14, 2008. WMATA had 14 similar lease agreements with other financial institutions when the KBC case went to trial. Waivers were requested from the banks to allow WMATA time to replace AIG with another insurer or guarantees by the federal government.

In 2009, WMATA issued two new series of municipal bonds bringing its total outstanding bonds to $390.9 million, as of June 30, 2010. This includes $55 million of Build America Bonds issued in 2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that are partially funded by the federal government.

However, most of the system&#x27;s debt is financed directly by each local jurisdiction. In addition, WMATA was authorized to receive $202 million in grants from the federal government for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act projects. The funds are spent in 30 projects which include information technology, facilities maintenance, and vehicles and vehicle parts.

On January 14, 2010, general manager John B. Catoe announced his resignation from Metro, effective April 2, 2010. He was replaced on April 3, 2010, by interim general manager Richard Sarles. Sarles became one of three finalists interviewing for the permanent position, and later became the permanent general manager on January 27, 2011. Jack Requa became the interim general manager upon Sarles&#x27; retirement January 16, 2015.

==Organization==

===Board of directors===
WMATA was originally set up with a board of directors, of twelve members. Of those, six were voting members, and six were alternates. In response to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, the WMATA Compact was amended on August 19, 2009, to allow the appointment of four additional board members by the federal government, bringing the total to sixteen.

, there were a total of sixteen board members: eight voting members and eight alternates. Virginia, Maryland, and the District had each appointed two voting members and two alternate members. The Federal Government, through the Secretary of Transportation, is authorized to appoint up to two voting and two alternate members.

Board members serve without pay, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses. The board appoints a general manager as CEO to supervise the day-to-day operation of the authority. Under the terms of the &quot;Procedures for WMATA Board of Directors&quot;, none of the individual board members, including the chairman, have any power to act regarding the operations of the authority or to issue instructions to the general manager or employees; only the entire board as a body has the power to instruct the general manager. It states, &quot;The authority of the Board of Directors is vested in the collective body and not in its individual Members. Accordingly, the Board, in establishing or providing any policies, orders, guidance, or instructions to the General Manager or WMATA staff, shall act as a body. No Member individually shall direct or supervise the General Manager or any WMATA employee or contractor.&quot;

The board approves WMATA&#x27;s annual budget. The budget was approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2019. That same year also saw 40.3% of revenues coming from capital contributions, 23.2% from passenger revenues, 31.7% from local jurisdiction operations funding, 3.5% from interest income, 1.6% from advertising revenue, 0.9% from rental revenue, and 0.2% from other sources.

As of July 2018, The WMATA board had the following standing committees: Executive, Finance and Capital, Capital &amp; Strategic Planning, and Safety and Operation.

The position of board chairman rotates between the three jurisdictions. Article III Section 5 of the Compact specifies the method of appointment. The Compact prohibits WMATA from paying board members. However, Maryland pays its voting board members $20,000 per year and Virginia pays $50 per meeting. The District of Columbia does not compensate its board members.

On February 17, 2011, outgoing 2010–11 WMATA Board Chairman Peter Benjamin announced he was leaving the board and would be replaced by former Congressman Michael D. Barnes. The new Governance Committee of the WMATA board, which at the time was chaired by Mary Hynes, held its first meeting and established a work plan to develop a new relationship between the board and WMATA management. The committee will draft new bylaws that will better define the role and term of the WMATA Board Chairman. The Governance Committee will also draft a code of conduct for board members.

===Management===
The general manager is the chief executive officer of WMATA and leads all staff except that the general counsel, inspector general, and board secretary, who report directly to the board. WMATA has a chief safety officer which reports to the general manager. The safety of the system is independently reviewed by the Tri-State Oversight Committee and the National Transportation Safety Board. On March 4, 2010, the Federal Transit Administration issued an &quot;Audit of the State Safety Oversight (SSO) program overseeing Metro&quot; which criticised the SSO as being underfunded and poorly trained. In response, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia have increased their SSO funding and training for their employees responsible for safety oversight at Metro.

Jackson Graham, a retired general in the Army Corps of Engineers who supervised the planning and initial construction of the Metrorail system, was the first general manager. Graham retired in 1976, and was replaced by Theodore C. Lutz. Richard S. Page, head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (the name of the Federal Transit Administration until 1991), took over as general manager of WMATA in 1979. Page resigned in 1983, amid increasing financial difficulties for WMATA. and was replaced by Carmen E. Turner, who served for seven years. Former New York City Transit Authority chief, David L. Gunn, took over as head of WMATA in 1991, followed by Lawrence G. Reuter in 1994, and Richard A. White in 1996.

White led efforts to improve accountability and dialogue with passengers during 2005. This included independent audits, town hall meetings, online chats with White and other management officials, and improved signage in stations. White had three more years in his contract to work for Metro, but had come under fire for mismanagement; however, he was also &quot;widely credited with saving the Metrobus system from collapse and with keeping Metro running during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.&quot; Despite these efforts, however, the board of directors dismissed White on January 11, 2006. Dan Tangherlini replaced White as interim general manager, effective February 16, 2006.

Tangherlini was considered a leading candidate for Metro&#x27;s top job on a permanent basis before he resigned to work as D.C. City Administrator under Mayor Adrian Fenty. On November 6, 2006, Tangherlini was replaced as interim general manager by Jack Requa, Metro&#x27;s chief bus manager. John B. Catoe Jr., who was previously the deputy chief executive officer of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, became the agency&#x27;s eighth permanent general manager on January 25, 2007. He resigned three years later following the deadliest crash in the Metrorail system&#x27;s history.

On April 3, 2010, the board of directors appointed Richard Sarles, former executive director of New Jersey Transit, as interim general manager. Sarles, 65, was offered the position of permanent general manager but declined the appointment at that time. However, on January 27, 2011, the Board announced that Sarles accepted the position as WMATA&#x27;s permanent general manager.

With Sarles&#x27; retirement, the post of general manager was filled by Paul Wiedefeld on November 30, 2015.

On January 18, 2022, WMATA announced that Paul Wiedefeld would be retiring from Metro in 6 months and WMATA&#x27;s board of directors will be conducting a national search for his replacement. On May 10, 2022, WMATA announced that current president and CEO of Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority Randy Clarke as its new general manager and CEO beginning in summer 2022. On May 16, 2022, Wiedefeld announced he will retire early with Andy Off being the interim general manager.

===Regional coordination===
The agency&#x27;s charter directs WMATA to create a unified regional transit system by coordinating other public and private agencies within its jurisdiction. Examples of its coordination efforts include: reducing unnecessary, duplicate services by other local transit systems, providing &quot;SmarTrip&quot; farecards for buses operated by other local transit agencies, and adding local bus schedules and commuter rail routes (such as Maryland&#x27;s MARC and Virginia&#x27;s VRE) to WMATA&#x27;s online &quot;Trip Planner&quot; guide.

===Transit Police===

Congress established the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) on June 4, 1976. MTPD police officers have jurisdiction and arrest powers for crimes that occur throughout the Transit Zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

===Inspector general===
The Office of Inspector General was originally authorized by Board Resolution 2006–18, approved by the WMATA Board on April 20, 2006. With the amendments enacted on August 19, 2009, the Office of Inspector General became part of the WMATA Compact. This change was one of the requirements for the $1.5 billion federal grant offered by the &quot;Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008&quot;. Helen Lew became the Metro&#x27;s first Inspector General on May 14, 2007, establishing the WMATA Office of Inspector General. Her appointment by the board of directors replaced the former Auditor General&#x27;s Office. On April 17, 2017, Geoffrey Cherrington replaced Lew, who retired, as Inspector General, Unlike the Auditor General, the Inspector General and his office report directly to the Board and are organizationally independent of WMATA management.

==Services==

===Metrorail===

Since opening in 1976, the Metrorail network has grown to include six lines, 98 stations, and 129 miles (208 km) of track. As of 2023, it is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the United States in average daily ridership after the New York City Subway The record for daily ridership was 1.12 million on January 20, 2009, the day of Barack Obama&#x27;s first Presidential Inauguration, followed by the Women&#x27;s March on January 21, 2017, with 1,001,613 trips. In 2016, Metrorail had nearly 180 million trips. Fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day. Riders enter and exit the system using a proximity card known as SmarTrip. SmarTrip cards can also be used on a smartphone through Apple Pay and Google Pay. Magnetic stripe tickets stopped being accepted on March 6, 2016. Metrorail&#x27;s frequency of service and fares vary depending on the available funding, the particular transit line, and the distance traveled.

Metro offers parking for commuters at 44 Metrorail stations. Most lots are on a first-come, first-served basis and fill up quickly each day. Thirty-six stations offer reserved parking, with customers purchasing permits to park in specified spaces. Four Metrorail stations (Greenbelt, Huntington, Franconia–Springfield, and Wiehle-Reston East) have spaces reserved for multi-day parking for up to ten days. Parking fees are paid by SmarTrip card or credit card. Cash payments are not accepted for parking fees.

===Metrobus===
Metrobus&#x27; fleet consists of 1,505 buses covering an area of in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. There are 269 bus routes serving 11,129 stops, including 2,554 bus shelters. Metrobus had 130.8 million trips in 2016. On a typical weekday, it provides more than 400,000 trips.

The route numbering represents its region of operation. To differ the regions numbering system, letters for Maryland routes appear before the route number and the ones for Virginia routes appear after it. For example, A12 serves Maryland, and 17M serves Virginia.

===Metroway===
Metroway is a bus rapid transit (BRT) service that began on August 24, 2014. The first phase is the Crystal City/Potomac Yard Transitway, which operates on Route 1 in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia. It is a corridor with 33 platforms and 20 stations located between and . The first 0.8 mile segment in Alexandria runs on a transit lane only. The Arlington County segment began construction in the summer of 2014 and opened April 17, 2016. Metroway originally operated between the Braddock Road and stations and was expanded to Pentagon City in April 2016. Thirteen 2016 New Flyer Xcelsior XN40 CNG buses (2981–2993) operate with the blue-and-white Metroway livery. The original Metroway fleet consisted of thirteen 2014 NABI 42 BRT diesel-electric hybrid buses (8002–8014) until they were all repainted in December 2016. The Metroway service, which is operated by Metrobus&#x27; Four Mile Run bus division, features dedicated bus lanes, transit signal priority, real-time information, custom designed shelters and stations, as well as near-level boarding at station platforms. A Metroway fare costs the same as Metrobus.

===MetroAccess===

MetroAccess is a paratransit service that WMATA provides through private contractors. It began operation in May 1994 and since that time annual ridership has grown from 200,000 to more than 2.4 million passengers. MetroAccess operates 365 days a year, providing door-to-door, shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance. It is now the sixth-largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of more than 600 vehicles and more than 1,000 employees. WMATA staff determines eligibility to use the service in response to written applications. The cost per passenger for MetroAccess is significantly higher than its fixed-route counterparts, and Metro has worked to provide as many opportunities to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed-route transit by its customers with disabilities.

==Art in transit==
WMATA includes art works at stations and sometimes on the trains. Thirty-nine stations include artwork. Funding for the art comes from several sources, including the town in which the station is located, the WMATA art program, the Federal Transit Administration, local art groups, and some pieces are gifts or on loan. WMATA has solicited feedback from riders concerning art in the stations and to guide choices on future installations.

==Funding==

Fares and other revenue fund 57.6% of the Metro&#x27;s daily operations while state and local governments fund the remaining 42.4%. Since the Metro&#x27;s inception, the federal government has provided grants for 65% of the system&#x27;s capital costs. Metrorail is unusual among major public transportation systems in having no dedicated source of funding. Instead, each year WMATA must ask each local jurisdiction to contribute funding, which is determined by a formula that equally considers three factors:
# population density, as of the most recent United States census;
# average weekday ridership;
# number of stations in each jurisdiction.

Under this formula, the District of Columbia contributes the greatest amount (37.5%), followed by Prince George&#x27;s County (20.8%), Montgomery County (16.6%), Fairfax County (13.5%), and 11.6% from all other jurisdictions. From time to time, a local jurisdiction will agree to subsidize a specific fare, with the jurisdiction funding the cost of the subsidy in addition to its contribution under the above formula. For example, the District of Columbia subsidized the fares charged at Metrorail stations located in economically challenged neighborhoods.

The cost of Metrobus is allocated under a formula that considers the excess of expenses over revenues from specific bus routes. The cost of MetroAccess is allocated under a different formula, which divides MetroAccess costs by the number of trips requested by riders who reside in each jurisdiction.

In 2004 the Brookings Institution released a report entitled &quot;Deficits by Design&quot; that found the agency&#x27;s serious budgetary challenges owe in large part to its problematic revenue base. Most notably, Brookings found that WMATA&#x27;s extraordinary lack of dedicated funding sources has necessitated an over-reliance on annually appropriated support that makes the agency vulnerable to perennial financial crises. As a result, the region&#x27;s political and business leaders created a committee to look at new ways to fund the system, including some type of dedicated tax.

Title VI of the &quot;Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008&quot;, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 16, 2008, authorized a grant of $1.5 billion over a 10-year period for Metrorail capital maintenance projects. The grant was contingent upon the establishment of dedicated revenue sources for the Metro by the Compact jurisdictions. An amendment to the Metro&#x27;s Compact on August 19, 2009, added the requirement for payments &quot;from dedicated funding sources&quot; by the Compact&#x27;s participating jurisdictions. In June 2010, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell threatened to withhold Virginia&#x27;s WMATA funding unless the composition of WMATA&#x27;s board is modified to allow Virginia&#x27;s Governor to appoint two of the four Virginia seats, instead of the localities. On June 17, 2010, Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff required a formal commitment from Virginia to match its share of the federal funds if the federal funding is to continue. On July 1, 2010, the WMATA Board of Directors agreed to provide matching funds without regard to McDonnell&#x27;s request for Board seats. Based on this agreement, the federal funds were reconfirmed, and WMATA was able to proceed with a contract to purchase 428 new Metrorail cars. McDonnell pressed for a Board seat again in 2011, and used his amendatory veto authority to amend the 2010-11 budget to require the NVTC to appoint someone of the Governor&#x27;s choosing to fill one of the NVTC seats on the WMATA Board.

In the course of considering a continuing resolution for federal fiscal year 2011, the U.S. House of Representatives sought to defund all &quot;earmarks&quot; including the $150 million annual installment toward the $1.5 billion in federal matching funds. On February 16, 2011, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) offered an amendment to reallocate $150 million from farm subsidy payments to meet this obligation, but the amendment was ruled out of order. The suspension of the federal appropriation also calls into question the matching funds from the individual jurisdictions for capital projects. On March 1, 2010, Republican Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell wrote to Congress urging the continuation of the federal funds. The continuing resolution for the remainder of 2011 ultimately included the federal matching funds.

The 57% funding of WMATA from fares and other revenue compares with New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority which receives 53% of its funding from fares and car tolls. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority receives of 31.8% of its funding from fares.

In an effort to gain revenues, WMATA has started to allow retail ventures in Metrorail stations. WMATA has authorized DVD-rental vending machines and ticket booths for the Old Town Trolley Tours and is seeking additional retail tenants.

==Controversy==

===Safety===

In recent years, WMATA has drawn criticism for a neglect of safety in both its rail and bus systems. Problems include failures within the system designed to prevent train collisions and escalators failing or breaking apart while in service. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended that WMATA invest $1 billion in needed safety improvements. A December 2008 report by the WMATA Inspector General documented that Metro&#x27;s System Safety and Risk Management Office was bypassed when changes were made to Metrorail&#x27;s operating procedures, even though that office&#x27;s review and approval was required as a matter of policy. On June 22, 2009, two Metrorail trains collided between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro stations, killing nine. In February 2011, the National Transportation Safety Board conducted a public hearing during which witnesses testified about problems with the safety culture at WMATA. The NTSB&#x27;s final report on the accident commented that &quot;[t]he failure of WMATA engineers and technicians or managers to properly address track circuit anomalies is symptomatic of the larger safety culture issues within the organization.&quot;

Safety concerns have grown to the point that the region&#x27;s Congressional delegation introduced the &quot;National Metro Safety Act of 2011,&quot; which would establish federal safety standards for heavy rail mass transit systems. In response, WMATA is replacing its track control system and ordered an immediate inspection of all of its escalators. That inspection showed that over 10 percent of the escalators had faulty brakes.

The service state of elevators and escalators is of public concern. WMATA posts a webpage that is updated daily to notify users of elevator and escalator outages. WMATA makes track announcements that contradict industry safety standards, encouraging passengers to &quot;stay clear of moving parts&quot;, encouraging people to stand on one side, and slowing the operating speed, which has the effect of encouraging walking on the escalators.

Closed-circuit television cameras monitor every Metrobus and every Metrorail station.

===Discrimination===
In 1990, Christine Townsend sued WMATA in the Washington federal district court on the basis of sexual discrimination. She won, with the court noting in the outcome of &quot;Townsend v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.&quot; that the WMATA explanation had &quot;many unexplained inconsistencies, irregularities, and holes&quot;.

Former Metro workers claim that WMATA consistently passes over non-black applicants or workers for employment or promotion.

In May 2015, the WMATA board voted to ban advocacy advertising after the American Freedom Defense Initiative sought to purchase advertisements in five subway stations and on twenty buses depicting Muhammad.

==Future expansion==

There has been speculation about an extension of the Green Line northward to Baltimore&#x27;s BWI Airport, There was also talk of extending the Green Line either to National Harbor or to White Plains via Waldorf. An extension from Franconia/Springfield to Fort Belvoir is also a possibility due to the Base Realignment and Closure process which relocated thousands of area defense jobs at Fort Belvoir in 2012. While there has been much discussion about all of these extensions, none are in any official planning stage. There have also been plans to extend the Orange Line to Centreville and Bowie.

Regarding Metrobus improvements, former general manager Sarles reported, &quot;Bus service will benefit from new technology that integrates fare box, destination signage and next bus systems to improve our reliability and customer information delivery. And, we will begin work in certain priority bus corridors that will deliver faster travel times for bus customers. Additionally, I look forward to working with the District of Columbia on potential bus rapid transit service improvements, such as curb running and signal preference to make bus service even more attractive, efficient, and an even more powerful antidote to traffic congestion.&quot;

==Operational==
===Energy efficiency initiatives===
WMATA reached an agreement in 2013 with the sustainable lighting division at Philips Electronics North America to switch to LEDs at no upfront cost. WMATA and Philips agreed to a ten-year maintenance contract through the $2 million savings the LEDs will provide each year.
===MICC===
WMATA&#x27;s Integrated Command and Communications Center (MICC), opened in 2023 in the Eisenhower East neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia, 14 stories tall, supporting 1400 employees. The MICC is the system&#x27;s technology hub, including the data center, cybersecurity operations, bus and rail video teams, communications, and administrative support.

<text>Gwyneth Jones (born 14 February 1952) is an English science fiction and fantasy writer and critic, and a young adult/children&#x27;s writer under the pen name Ann Halam.

==Biography and writing career==
Jones was born in Manchester, England. Education at a convent school was followed by an undergraduate degree in European history of ideas at the University of Sussex. She has written for younger readers since 1980 under the pseudonym Ann Halam and, under that name, has published more than twenty novels. In 1984 &quot;Divine Endurance&quot;, a science fiction novel for adults, was published under her own name and in which she created the term gynoid. She continues to write using these two names for the respective audiences.

Jones&#x27; works are mostly science fiction and near future high fantasy with strong themes of gender and feminism. She is the winner of two World Fantasy Awards, BSFA short story award, Children of the Night Award from the Dracula Society, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the Philip K. Dick Award and co-winner of the James Tiptree Jr. Award. She is generally well-reviewed critically and, as a feminist science fiction writer, is often compared to Ursula K. Le Guin, though the two authors are very much distinct in both content and style of work.

Gwyneth Jones lives in Brighton, England, with her husband and son.

<doc id="1157349" wikidata="Q3268411" url="?curid=1157349" title="Lycium">
<text>Lycium is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. The genus has a disjunct distribution around the globe, with species occurring on most continents in temperate and subtropical regions. South America has the most species, followed by North America and southern Africa. There are several scattered across Europe and Asia, and one is native to Australia. Common English names for plants of this genus include box-thorn, wolfberry, and desert-thorn. Plants of the World Online currently accepts 101 species. Other estimates are of 70 to 80 species.

==Etymology==

The generic name &quot;Lycium&quot; is derived from the Greek word λυκιον (&quot;lykion&quot;), which was applied by Pliny the Elder (23-79) and Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40–90) to a plant known as dyer&#x27;s buckthorn. It was probably a &quot;Rhamnus&quot; species and was named for Lycia (Λυκία), the ancient southern Anatolian region in which it grew. The berry is called &quot;lycii fructus&quot; (&quot;lycium fruit&quot;) in old Latin pharmacological texts.

==Description==

&quot;Lycium&quot; are shrubs, often thorny, growing 1 to 4 meters tall. The leaves are small, narrow, and fleshy, and are alternately arranged, sometimes in fascicles. Flowers are solitary or borne in clusters. The funnel-shaped or bell-shaped corolla is white, green, or purple in color. The fruit is a two-chambered, usually fleshy and juicy berry which can be red, orange, yellow, or black. It may have few seeds or many. Most &quot;Lycium&quot; have fleshy, red berries with over 10 seeds, but a few American taxa have hard fruits with two seeds.

While most &quot;Lycium&quot; are monoecious, producing bisexual flowers with functional male and female parts, some species are gynodioecious, with some individuals bearing bisexual flowers and some producing functionally female flowers.

==Uses==
&quot;Lycium&quot; has been known to European herbalists since ancient times, and species were traded from the Far East to Europe by the Romans, for example via Ariaca and the port of Barbarikon near today&#x27;s Karachi, as mentioned in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;. In his &quot;Naturalis historia&quot;, Pliny the Elder describes boxthorn as a medicinal plant, as does Pedanius Dioscorides in his &quot;P. Dioscoridae pharmacorum simplicium reique medicae&quot;.

In his 1753 publication &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, Linnaeus describes three &quot;Lycium&quot; species: &quot;L. afrum&quot;, &quot;L. barbarum&quot;, and &quot;L. europaeum&quot;.
&quot;Lycium&quot;, particularly &quot;L. barbarum&quot;, have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The leaves and roots of other species of &quot;Lycium&quot;, such as &quot;L. europaeum&quot;, when mixed with water, have been used in folk medicine. The fruit of &quot;L. barbatum&quot; and &quot;L. chinense&quot;, known as goji berry, is commonly consumed as a dried fruit. The Chinese tonic &quot;gou qi zi&quot; (&quot;wolfberry fruit&quot;) is made of the fruit of any of several &quot;Lycium&quot; species, and is used as a dietary supplement.

==Ecology==
&quot;Lycium&quot; species mostly occur in arid and semi-arid climates, and a few are known from coastal zones in somewhat saline habitat types.

Invasive species include &quot;L. ferocissimum&quot;, which was introduced to Australia and New Zealand and has become a dense, thorny pest plant there. It injures livestock, harbors pest mammals and insects, and displaces native species.

<doc id="1157354" wikidata="Q1541329" url="?curid=1157354" title="Mixed-signal integrated circuit">
<text>A mixed-signal integrated circuit is any integrated circuit that has both analog circuits and digital circuits on a single semiconductor die. Their usage has grown dramatically with the increased use of cell phones, telecommunications, portable electronics, and automobiles with electronics and digital sensors.

==Overview ==
Integrated circuits (ICs) are generally classified as digital (e.g. a microprocessor) or analog (e.g. an operational amplifier). Mixed-signal ICs contain both digital and analog circuitry on the same chip, and sometimes embedded software. Mixed-signal ICs process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a typical mixed-signal circuit.

Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs.

Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.

Mixed-signal functionality involves both traditional active elements (like transistors) and well-performing passive elements (like coils, capacitors, and resistors) on the same chip. This requires additional modelling understanding and options from manufacturing technologies. High voltage transistors might be needed in the power management functions on a chip with digital functionality, possibly with a low-power CMOS processor system. Some advanced mixed-signal technologies may enable combining analog sensor elements (like pressure sensors or imaging diodes) on the same chip with an ADC. 

Typically, mixed-signal ICs do not necessarily need the fastest digital performance. Instead, they need more mature models of active and passive elements for more accurate simulations and verification, such as for testability planning and reliability estimations. Therefore, mixed-signal circuits are typically realized with larger line widths than the highest speed and densest digital logic, and the implementation technologies can be two to four generations behind the latest digital-only implementation technologies. Additionally, mixed signal processing may need passive elements like resistors, capacitors, and coils, which may require specialized metal, dielectric layers, or similar adaptations of standard fabrication processes. Because of these specific requirements, mixed-signal ICs and digital ICs can have different manufacturers (known as foundries).

== Applications ==
There are numerous applications of mixed-signal integrated circuits, such as in mobile phones, modern radio and telecommunication systems, sensor systems with on-chip standardized digital interfaces (including I2C, UART, SPI, or CAN), voice-related signal processing, aerospace and space electronics, the Internet of things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and automotive and other electrical vehicles. Mixed-signal circuits or systems are typically cost-effective solutions, such as for building modern consumer electronics and in industrial, medical, measurement, and space applications. 

Examples of mixed-signal integrated circuits include data converters using delta-sigma modulation, analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converters using error detection and correction, and digital radio chips. Digitally controlled sound chips are also mixed-signal circuits. With the advent of cellular and network technology, this category now includes cellular telephone, software radio, and LAN and WAN router integrated circuits. 

== Design and development ==
Typically, mixed-signal chips perform some whole function or sub-function in a larger assembly, such as the radio subsystem of a cell phone, or the read data path and laser SLED control logic of a DVD player. Mixed-signal ICs often contain an entire system-on-a-chip. They may also contain on-chip memory blocks (like OTP), which complicates the manufacturing compared to analog ICs. A mixed-signal IC minimizes off-chip interconnects between digital and analog functionality in the system—typically reducing size and weight due to minimized packaging and a smaller module substrate—and therefore increases the reliability of the system.

Because of the use of both digital signal processing and analog circuitry, mixed-signal ICs are usually designed for a very specific purpose. Their design requires a high level of expertise and careful use of computer aided design (CAD) tools. There also exists specific design tools (like mixed-signal simulators) or description languages (like VHDL-AMS). Automated testing of the finished chips can also be challenging. Teradyne, Keysight, and Advantest are the major suppliers of the test equipment for mixed-signal chips.

There are several particular challenges of mixed-signal circuit manufacturing:
* CMOS technology is usually optimal for digital performance, while bipolar junction transistors are usually optimal for analog performance. However, until the last decade, it was difficult to combine these cost-effectively or to design both in a single technology without serious performance compromises. The advent of technologies like high performance CMOS, BiCMOS, CMOS SOI, and SiGe have removed many of these former compromises.
* Testing functional operation of mixed-signal ICs remains complex, expensive, and often is a &quot;one-off&quot; implementation task (meaning a lot of work is necessary for a product with a single, specific use).
* Systematic design methods of analog and mixed-signal circuits are far more primitive than digital circuits. In general, analog circuit design cannot be automated to nearly the extent that digital circuit design can. Combining the two technologies multiplies this complication.
* Fast-changing digital signals send noise to sensitive analog inputs. One path for this noise is substrate coupling. A variety of techniques are used to attempt to block or cancel this noise coupling, such as fully differential amplifiers, P+ guard-rings, differential topology, on-chip decoupling, and triple-well isolation.

=== Variations ===
Mixed-signal devices are available as standard parts, but sometimes custom-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are necessary. ASICs are designed for new applications, when new standards emerge, or when new energy source(s) are implemented in the system. Due to their specialization, ASICs are usually only developed when production volumes are estimated to be high. The availability of ready-and-tested analog- and mixed-signal IP blocks from foundries or dedicated design houses has lowered the gap to realize mixed-signal ASICs. 

There also exist mixed-signal field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and microcontrollers. In these, the same chip that handles digital logic may contain mixed-signal structures like analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter(s), operational amplifiers, or wireless connectivity blocks. These mixed-signal FPGAs and microcontrollers are bridging the gap between standard mixed-signal devices, full-custom ASICs, and embedded software; they offer a solution during product development or when product volume is too low to justify an ASIC. However, they can have performance limitations, such as the resolution of the analog-to-digital converters, the speed of digital-to-analog conversion, or a limited number of inputs and outputs. Nevertheless, they can speed up the system architecture design, prototyping, and even production (at small and medium scales). Their usage also can be supported with development boards, development community, and possibly software support.

==History==
===MOS switched-capacitor circuits===
The MOSFET was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, after Frosch and Derick discovered and used surface passivation by silicon dioxide to create the first planar transistors, the first in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby invention of the silicon integrated cicruit was enabled by the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni. In turn, Hoerni&#x27;s planar process was inspired by the surface passivation method developed at Bell Labs by Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick in 1955 and 1957.

MOS technology eventually became practical for telephony applications with the MOS mixed-signal integrated circuit, which combines analog and digital signal processing on a single chip, developed by former Bell engineer David A. Hodges with Paul R. Gray at UC Berkeley in the early 1970s. In 1974, Hodges and Gray worked with R.E. Suarez to develop MOS switched capacitor (SC) circuit technology, which they used to develop a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, using MOS capacitors and MOSFET switches for data conversion. MOS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and DAC chips were commercialized by 1974.

MOS SC circuits led to the development of pulse-code modulation (PCM) codec-filter chips in the late 1970s. The silicon-gate CMOS (complementary MOS) PCM codec-filter chip, developed by Hodges and W.C. Black in 1980, has since been the industry standard for digital telephony. By the 1990s, telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) had been largely digitized with very-large-scale integration (VLSI) CMOS PCM codec-filters, widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges, private branch exchanges (PBX), and key telephone systems (KTS); user-end modems; data transmission applications such as digital loop carriers, pair gain multiplexers, telephone loop extenders, integrated services digital network (ISDN) terminals, digital cordless telephones, and digital cell phones; and applications such as speech recognition equipment, voice data storage, voice mail, and digital tapeless answering machines. The bandwidth of digital telecommunication networks has been rapidly increasing at an exponential rate, as observed by Edholm&#x27;s law, largely driven by the rapid scaling and miniaturization of MOS technology.

===RF CMOS circuits===

While working at Bell Labs in the early 1980s, Pakistani engineer Asad Abidi worked on the development of sub-micron MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) VLSI (very large-scale integration) technology at the Advanced LSI Development Lab, along with Marty Lepselter, George E. Smith, and Harry Bol. As one of the few circuit designers at the lab, Abidi demonstrated the potential of sub-micron NMOS integrated circuit technology in high-speed communication circuits, and developed the first MOS amplifiers for Gb/s data rates in optical fiber receivers. Abidi&#x27;s work was initially met with skepticism from proponents of gallium arsenide and bipolar junction transistors, the dominant technologies for high-speed circuits at the time. In 1985, he joined UCLA, where he pioneered RF CMOS technology in the late 1980s. His work changed the way in which radio-frequency (RF) circuits would be designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits.

Abidi was researching analog CMOS circuits for signal processing and communications during the late 1980s to early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, the RF CMOS technology that he pioneered was widely adopted in wireless networking, as mobile phones began entering widespread use. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices.

The baseband processors and radio transceivers in all modern wireless networking devices and mobile phones are mass-produced using RF CMOS devices. RF CMOS circuits are widely used to transmit and receive wireless signals in a variety of applications, such as satellite technology (such as GPS), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, near-field communication (NFC), mobile networks (such as 3G, 4G, and 5G), terrestrial broadcast, and automotive radar applications, among other uses. RF CMOS technology is crucial to modern wireless communications, including wireless networks and mobile communication devices.

<text>A marriage of convenience is a marriage contracted for reasons other than that of love and commitment. Instead, such a marriage is entered into for personal gain, or some other sort of strategic purpose, such as a political marriage. Cases where those married do not intend to live together as a couple, and typically married only for one of them to gain the right to reside in a country, are considered to be sham marriages. In many cultures, it is usual for parents to decide their adult children&#x27;s marriages; this is called an arranged marriage.

Marriages of convenience that are sham, and arranged marriages that are forced, are against the law in many jurisdictions.

==Legal loophole==
Marriages of convenience are often contracted to exploit legal loopholes of various sorts. A couple may wed for one of them to gain citizenship or right of abode, for example, as many countries around the world will grant such rights to anyone married to a resident citizen. In the United States, this practice is known as a green card marriage. In Australia, there have been marriages of convenience to bring attention to the government&#x27;s Youth Allowance laws. On 31 March 2010 two students were publicly and legally married on the University of Adelaide&#x27;s lawn so that they could both receive full Youth Allowance. In the United States during the era of the Vietnam War, some couples were wed during the man&#x27;s time of exposure to the military draft; the couple agreed to no contact, followed by an annulment at the end of the (typically one year) marriage. Advertisements were commonly placed in student newspapers to this effect. Because they exploit legal loopholes, sham marriages of convenience often have legal consequences. For example, U.S. Immigration (USCIS) can punish this with a US$250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence.

The term &quot;contract marriage&quot; is used by U.S. military personnel to describe marrying mainly in order to receive extra pay and housing benefits that the couple would not otherwise be entitled to.

==Homosexuality==
Another common reason for marriages of convenience is to hide one partner&#x27;s homosexuality in places where being openly gay is punishable or potentially detrimental. A sham marriage of this type, sometimes called a lavender marriage, is usually performed to keep the appearance of heterosexuality to prevent negative consequences of LGBT discrimination. Such marriages may have one heterosexual and one gay partner, or two gay partners: a lesbian and a gay man married to each other. In the case where a gay man marries a woman, the woman is sometimes said to be his &quot;beard&quot;, while in the case where a lesbian marries a man, the man is sometimes said to be her &quot;merkin&quot;.

==Metaphorical usage==

The phrase &quot;marriage of convenience&quot; is used metaphorically to mean any partnership between groups or individuals for their mutual (and sometimes illegitimate) benefit, or between groups or individuals otherwise unsuited to working together. An example would be a &quot;national unity government&quot;, as existed in Israel during much of the 1980s or in the United Kingdom during World War II. More specifically, cohabitation refers to a political situation which can occur in countries with a semi-presidential system (especially France), where the president and the prime minister belong to opposed political camps.

==Political marriage==

Marriages of convenience, often termed marriages of state, have always been commonplace in royal, aristocratic, and otherwise powerful families, to make alliances between two powerful houses. Examples include the marriages of Agnes of Courtenay, her daughter Sibylla, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, and Catherine of Aragon. Marriage equality played a major role in princely families, less in England and Scotland than in the monarchies of the continent. Even among the non-ruling nobility, great importance was attached to marriages appropriate to their status.

==Literature==
The topic was treated literary through Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1909 novel &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, which describes a young unworldly and dreamy prince who forces himself into a marriage of convenience that ultimately becomes happy. The story was modeled after Mann&#x27;s own romance and marriage to Katia Mann in February 1905, which was to be blessed with six children, although it was not reasons of state or equality that motivated this marriage of convenience, but rather the author&#x27;s homosexuality which made him want acceptance and starting a family (along with, incidentally, the prospect of a rich dowry) at a time when homosexuality was still punishable and ostracized. However, his love for boys remained, but was lived out platonically.

<doc id="1157369" wikidata="Q315893" url="?curid=1157369" title="Shulgi">
<text>Shulgi ( [[Dingir|d]]šul-gi,(died c. 2046 BC) formerly read as Dungi) of Ur was the second king of the Third Dynasty of Ur. He reigned for 48 years, from (Middle Chronology). His accomplishments include the completion of construction of the Great Ziggurat of Ur, begun by his father Ur-Nammu. On his inscriptions, he took the titles &quot;King of Ur&quot;, &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, adding &quot;King of the four corners of the universe&quot; in the second half of his reign. He used the symbol for divinity () before his name, marking his apotheosis, from at least the 21st year of his reign and was worshipped in the Ekhursag palace he built. Shulgi was the son of Ur-Nammu king of Ur and his queen consort Watartum.

==Life and reign==
Shulgi apparently led a major modernization of the Third Dynasty of Ur. He improved communications, reorganized the army, reformed the writing system and weight and measures, unified the tax system, and created a strong bureaucracy. He also wrote a law code, now known as the Code of Ur-Nammu because it was originally thought to have been authored by Ur-Nammu. He also built or rebuilt numerous temples throughout the empire.

Shulgi is best known for his extensive revision of the scribal school&#x27;s curriculum. Although it is unclear how much he actually wrote, there are numerous praise poems written by and directed towards this ruler. He had proclaimed himself a god by his 21st regnal year (there are indications this occurred as early as S12), and was recognized as such by the whole of Sumer and Akkad.

Some much later chronicles castigate Shulgi for his impiety: The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19), a literary composition written in the 1st millennium BC, states that &quot;he did not perform his rites to the letter, he defiled his purification rituals&quot;. CM 48, written late in the 1st millennium BC, charges him with improper tampering with the rites, composing &quot;untruthful stelae, insolent writings&quot; on them. The &quot;Chronicle of Early Kings&quot; (ABC 20), written in the mid-2nd millennium BC, accuses him of &quot;criminal tendencies, and the property of Esagila and Babylon he took away as booty.&quot;

The manner of death is unknown, only that it occurred in his 48th regnal year, in or before the 11th month. In the 3rd month of his successor, libations to the dead were first recorded for Shulgi and two wives Geme-Ninlila and Shulgi-simti. All three appear to have died in the year 48. Several researchers have suggest Shulgi was assassinated, partly based on omen texts, including one based on an eclipse. He was succeeded by Amar-Sin. The name Amar-Sin was not recorded before his ascension and is a &quot;throne name&quot;. His original name, and whether he was actually the son of Shugi, is unknown.

===Name===
Early uncertainties about the reading of cuneiform led to the readings &quot;Shulgi&quot; and &quot;Dungi&quot; being common transliterations before the end of the 19th century. However, over the course of the 20th century, the scholarly consensus gravitated away from &quot;dun &quot;towards &quot;shul&quot; as the correct pronunciation of the sign. The spelling of Shulgi&#x27;s name by scribes with the &quot;diĝir&quot; determinative reflects his deification during his reign, a status and spelling previously claimed by his Akkadian Empire predecessor Naram-Sin.

===Marriages===
Shulgi was a contemporary of the &quot;Shakkanakku&quot; rulers of Mari, particularly Apil-kin and Iddi-ilum. An inscription mentions that Taram-Uram, the daughter of Apil-kin, became the &quot;daughter-in-law&quot; of Ur-Nammu, and therefore the Queen of king Shulgi. In the inscription, she called herself &quot;daughter-in-law of Ur-Nammu&quot;, and &quot;daughter of Apil-kin, &quot;Lugal&quot; (&quot;King&quot;) of Mari&quot;, suggesting for Apil-kin a position as a supreme ruler, and pointing to a marital alliance between Mari and Ur.

Nin-kalla, Amat-Sin, and Ea-niša were queens of Shulgi. This had influence and performed official functions which continued even after the death of Shulgi. Another queen, Shulgi-simti, who is known from a high number of texts presenting evidence for her economic power, had similar status. The archive shows she selected various large animals to use in rituals for deities including Belet-Šuḫnir and Belet-Terraban, Annunitum, Ulmašītum, Nanna, Ninlil and Enlil. From thirty-second to forty-seventh year of Shulgi&#x27;s reign she was in charge of the acceptance of ritual animals. On their death &quot;libation places&quot; for her and Shulgi were established. Another important woman was Geme-Ninlilla who appears in texts at the end of the king&#x27;s reign. Other, less well known royal women are Šuqurtum, Simat-Ea and Geme-Su&#x27;ena.

Shulgi, with many wives and concubines, is known to have had at least sixteen sons including Etel-pū-Dagān, Amar-dDa-mu, Lu-dNanna, Lugal-a-zi-da, Ur-d,Suen, and possibly Amar-Sin (his throne name) as well as one daughter, Peš-tur-tur. The name of another daughter, Šāt-Kukuti, is known from a cuneiform tablet. A daughter, Taram-Šulgi was married to the ruler of Pašime, Šudda-bani.

===Royal hymns===

Shulgi also boasted about his ability to maintain high speeds while running long distances. He claimed in his 7th regnal year to have run from Nippur to Ur, a distance of not less than 100 miles. Kramer refers to Shulgi as &quot;The first long distance running champion.&quot;

Shulgi wrote 26 royal hymns to glorify himself and his actions. In one Shulgi claimed that he spoke Elamite as well as he spoke Sumerian. In another he refers to himself as &quot;the king of the four-quarters, the pastor of the black-headed people&quot;.

===Armed conflicts===
While Der had been one of the cities whose temple affairs Shulgi had directed in the first part of his reign, in his 20th year he claimed that the gods had decided that it now be destroyed, apparently as some punishment. The inscriptions state that he &quot;put its field accounts in order&quot; with the pick-axe. His 18th year-name was &quot;Year Liwir-mitashu, the king&#x27;s daughter, was elevated to the ladyship in Marhashi&quot;, referring to a country near Anshan and her dynastic marriage to its king, Libanukshabash. Following this, Shulgi engaged in a period of expansionism at the expense of highlanders such as the Lullubi, and destroyed Simurrum (another mountain tribe) and Lulubum nine times between the 26th and 45th years of his reign. He is also known to have destroyed Karaḫar, Harši, Šašrum, and Urbilum.
In his 30th year, his daughter was married to the governor of Anshan; in his 34th year, he was already levying a punitive campaign against the place. He also destroyed Kimaš and Ḫurti (cities to the east of Ur, somewhere near Elam) in the 45th year of his reign. An inscribed brick recorded:
 As with many Mesopotamian rulers he dealt with nomadic incursion in his 37th year, he was obliged to build a large wall in an attempt to keep out the Tidnumite nomads.

===Susa===
Shulgi is known to have made dedications at Susa, as foundation nails with his name, dedicated to god Inshushinak have been found there. One of the votive foundation nails reads: &quot;The god &#x27;Lord of Susa,&#x27; his king, Shulgi, the mighty male, king of Ur, king of Sumer and Akkad, the..., his beloved temple, built.&quot;. An etched carnelian bead, now located in the Louvre Museum (Sb 6627) and inscribed with a dedication by Shulgi was also found in Susa, the inscription reading: &quot;Ningal, his mother, Shulgi, god of his land, King of Ur, King of the four world quarters, for his life dedicated (this)&quot;.

The Ur III dynasty had held control over Susa since the demise of Puzur-Inshushinak, and they built numerous buildings and temples there. This control was continued by Shulgi as shown by his numerous dedications in the city-state. He also engaged in marital alliances, by marrying his daughters to rulers of eastern territories, such as Anšan, Marhashi and Bashime.

==Year names==

There are extensive remains for the year names of Shulgi, which have been largely reconstructed from year 1 to year 48 though some are fragmentary. There are no contemporary lists of year names, only partial texts from the Old Babylonian period so the order is not completely certain and a few years attribution is uncertain between Ur-Nammu and Shulgi. There are also multiple year names for some years which is not unprecedented. For example year 20 is &quot;Year: “Ninḫursaga of Nutur was brought into her temple”&quot; and &quot;Year: “The sons of Ur were conscripted as lancers”&quot;. Some of the most important are:

Year name 39 of Shulgi was &quot;The year Šulgi, king of Ur, king of the four quarters, built é-Puzriš-Dagan, a residence {palace? temple?} of Šulgi&quot;.

<text>In Raman spectroscopy, the depolarization ratio is the intensity ratio between the perpendicular component and the parallel component of Raman scattered light.

Early work in this field was carried out by George Placzek, who developed the theoretical treatment of bond polarizability.

The Raman scattered light is emitted by the stimulation of the electric field of the incident light. Therefore, the direction of the vibration of the electric field, or polarization direction, of the scattered light might be expected to be the same as that of the incident light. In reality, however, some fraction of the Raman scattered light has a polarization direction that is perpendicular to that of the incident light. This component is called the &#x27;. Naturally, the component of the Raman scattered light whose polarization direction is parallel to that of the incident light is called the &#x27;, and the Raman scattered light consists of the parallel component and the perpendicular component.

The ratio of the peak intensity of the parallel and perpendicular component is known as the depolarization ratio (), defined in equation 1.

For example, a spectral band with a peak of intensity 10 units when the polarizers are parallel, and an intensity 1 unit when the polarizers are perpendicular, would have a depolarization ratio of 1/10 = 0.1, which corresponds to a highly polarized band.

The value of the depolarization ratio of a Raman band depends on the symmetry of the molecule and the normal vibrational mode, in other words, the point group of the molecule and its irreducible representation to which the normal mode belongs. Under Placzek&#x27;s polarizability approximation, it is known that the depolarization ratio of a totally symmetric vibrational mode is less than 0.75, and that of the other modes equals 0.75. A Raman band whose depolarization ratio is less than 0.75 is called a &#x27;, and a band with a depolarization ratio equal to or greater than 0.75 is called a &#x27;.

For a spherical top molecule in which all three axes are equivalent, symmetric vibrations have Raman spectral bands which are completely polarized (). An example is the symmetric stretching or &quot;breathing&quot; mode of methane () in which all four bonds vibrate in phase. However, for the asymmetric mode in which one bond stretches while the other three contract, the Raman scattered radiation is depolarized.

For molecules of lower symmetry (symmetric tops or asymmetric tops), a vibration with the full symmetry of the molecule leads to a polarized or partially polarized Raman band (), while a less symmetric vibration yields a depolarized band ().

<text>Ángel Luis &quot;Cholo&quot; Espada Mangual (born February 2, 1948) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer. He was the WBA&#x27;s world Welterweight champion in 1975-76. A music lover, Espada also organized, during the late 1970s, a salsa orchestra.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Espada began his professional boxing career on March 11, 1967, with a defeat at the hands of future Antonio Cervantes world title challenger Josue Marquez, on a six-round decision, at San Juan. His next two fights were declared draws (ties). Both were against Luis Vinales.

After another defeat and a draw (both against Chris Fernandez), Espada got his first win. On April 1, 1968, he knocked out Linfer Contreras in the first round in San Juan. After one more win, he fought outside Puerto Rico for the first time, losing on points after six rounds to future Roberto Durán world title challenger Jimmy Robertson, on September 27, 1969, at Los Angeles, California.

His next fight would be against Bobby Joe Hughes, April 9, 1969 in San Juan. Hughes was disqualified for using illegal tactics during the fight, and this victory marked the beginning of a fifteen fight winning streak for Espada. On November 7 of 1970, the streak was stopped by Matt Donovan, who beat him on points over ten rounds. Shortly after, Espada would beat former Emile Griffith world title challenger Manuel Gonzalez and lose to former world champion Eddie Perkins, both times, on points after ten rounds.

Between 1972 and 1975, Espada posted twelve wins in a row, including a victory over perennial world title challenger Armando Muniz, and a win in Panama. He was beaten by Luis Acosta in Caracas by decision in ten rounds to stop that winning streak, but he avenged the defeat against Acosta with a ten-round win over him in a rematch held in San Juan.

===Champion===
Espada became a world champion in a situation that could be described by some as bizarre: the undisputed world Welterweight champion of the era, José Nápoles, was to fight Carlos Monzón for the world&#x27;s Middleweight title. The WBC kept recognizing Nápoles as their world Welterweight champion, but the WBA, feeling that Espada deserved a chance at Nápoles&#x27; crown, decided to strip Nápoles of the world championship because Nápoles went ahead as planned and fought Monzon. Thus, on June 28, 1975, Espada became the WBA&#x27;s world Welterweight champion, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s fourth world boxing champion in history, by outpointing the well known Canadian, Clyde Gray, over fifteen rounds in San Juan. Coincidentally, Espada won his world title the same week that Alfredo Escalera won the WBC world Junior Lightweight championship at a fight that took place in Japan; this was the first time two Puerto Ricans became world champions the same week and as a consequence, Puerto Rico, a country that had only produced two world boxing champions in its history, doubled their number of champions in one week with Espada and Escalera&#x27;s victories. (In Spanish)

He retained the title with a fifteen-round decision over Johnny Gant, and won a non-title fight with an eighth-round knockout over Alfonzo Hayman.

On July 17, 1976, Espada fought what would have been the start of a Mexican boxing tour. Espada, looking forward to meeting Miguel Campanino, was instead faced with a boxer who had a record of 16-5 and who was named José Cuevas. Cuevas lifted the WBA world Welterweight title away from Espada with a second-round knockout. They would fight again twice, with Cuevas retaining the title by ten and eleven-round knockouts.

===Retirement from the Ring===
Towards the end of his career, Espada, realizing his best days as a boxer had probably passed him by, announced on the Vea magazine that he was putting together a salsa orchestra. The &quot;Cholo Espada orchestra&quot; had some success in Puerto Rico, appearing on television shows constantly during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Espada lost his last important fight, against Thomas Hearns, by a knockout in round four at the Joe Louis Arena, in Detroit, on March 2 of 1980. He then retired for a short period of time. Espada wanted to retire as a winner, however, and, after one year of inactivity, he made a one fight comeback, knocking out Julio Alfonso in four rounds, on December 10, 1981, in San Juan.

After retiring from boxing, Espada became a boxing trainer, and he has remained in that position ever since. Espada had a record of 44 wins, 11 losses and 3 draws, with 27 wins by knockout.

<text>The  is the Japanese affiliate of the International Red Cross.

The Imperial Family of Japan has traditionally supported the society, with the Empress as Honorary President and other imperial family members as vice presidents. Its headquarters is located in Tokyo, and local chapters are set up in all 47 prefectures. 9,610,000 individual and 120,000 corporate members belong to the society, which operates 92 Red Cross hospitals and 79 blood centers all over the country. The Japanese Red Cross Society conducts relief activities when major disasters take place. Large earthquakes that frequently occur in Japan (such as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami) are an area of work for the society.

== History ==

Count Sano Tsunetami founded the , a relief organization for the injured of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877; a modified version of the Japanese flag was used by the organization until 1887. Its name was changed to the Japanese Red Cross Society on 2 September 1887 following Japan&#x27;s admission to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Later that year, the society engaged in its first disaster relief after the eruption of Mount Bandai.

From the beginning, the Japanese Imperial family, especially Empress Shōken, provided active support for Red Cross activities. The attendance of the imperial family made membership in the society socially attractive to members of the Kazoku aristocracy and leading members of society. By the start of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the Japanese Red Cross Society was the largest in the world, with over a million members. The Society played an outstanding role with regards to the many Russian prisoners of war, gaining Japan a considerable amount of good public relations in the western press. This image was cultivated by the hosting of volunteer nurses and medical staff from the United States, France, Germany, and Great Britain. A report from Anita Newcomb McGee on conditions in Japan was instrumental in obtaining government assistance in the revitalization of the American Red Cross.

After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the Japanese Red Cross Society collected $146,000 for the American relief effort, marking the first overseas operation by the society.

In September 1914, during World War I, at the request of the Imperial Japanese Army, the Red Cross put together three squads, each composed of one surgeon and twenty nurses, who were dispatched to Europe on a five-month assignment. The teams left Japan between October and December 1914 and were assigned to Petrograd, Paris, and Southampton. The arrival of these nurses received wide press coverage, and their host countries subsequently asked for these teams to extend their assignment to fifteen months. Meanwhile, within Japan, German prisoners of war, who had been captured at the Battle of Tsingtao, were treated fairly well with the help of the Red Cross.

In 1934, the Japanese Red Cross Society hosted the 15th International Conference of the Red Cross in Tokyo.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), the Japanese Red Cross Society played a vital role in assisting Japanese civilians and wounded soldiers. However, as the Imperial Japanese Army tended to ignore the Geneva Convention, government and military restrictions hampered the ability of the Japanese Red Cross Society to assist the hundreds of thousands of European military and civilians interned in prison camps in the Japanese-occupied areas of Southeast Asia.

After World War II, the Japanese Red Cross Society was reformed under American advisers. On 14 August 1952, it was given legal status as a special non-profit corporation.

<text>California is a village in the north of the civil parish of Finchampstead in the English county of Berkshire. It is situated approximately south of Wokingham.

==Amenities==
There are local shops, restaurants, a chemist, post office and petrol station, doctor&#x27;s surgery and Ratepayers Hall at California Crossroads.

Nine Mile Ride Primary and Gorse Ride Schools school serve the California end of the parish. Nine Mile Ride has approximately 350 children.

St Mary and St John California is a Church of England church which meets at Gorse Ride Junior School in California. It replaced the old Army church on the Nine Mile Ride. It is a shared ministry with St James&#x27; at Finchampstead.

In the early 21st century, the congregation of the Baptist Church at Finchampstead outgrew its capacity and they began worshipping at Waverley School in California instead. In April 2010 the new Finchampstead Baptist Church Centre was opened in Gorse Ride North in California. The centre was built by Finchampstead Baptist Church in partnership with Wokingham Borough Council and Finchampstead Parish Council. The centre provides a cafe, sports hall and conference rooms for community use and is used by an increasing number of community groups.

The place is best known for its country park, centred on Longmoor Lake, on the edge of Barkham Common.

==Housing==

California is a large residential village. Most of Finchampstead parish&#x27;s housing is located there, most notably the Fernlea Estate, built on private farmland, and the Gorse Ride estate, built on the site of a watercress farm and gorse woodland. Gorse Ride South estate was built as a temporary measure for only 10 years. The properties consist of terraced houses and terraced bungalows. All were designed by the Ministry of Housing known as MOHLG construction. The properties have textured plywood outer wall panels and solid concrete foundations. Although only designed for a lifespan of 10 years, all the dwellings are now permanent properties, after being refurbished in 1977 with timber cladding on the external plywood walls, and tiled roofs over the previous felt roofs. By the 2010s, some of the council housing on the Gorse Ride South estate had fallen into disrepair. The houses have structural problems and poor drainage, and the bungalows have insulation and subsidence issues. In an effort to improve the estate, the large FBC community centre opened in 2010. As of 2018, Wokingham Borough Council has secured funding to redevelop the entire estate, starting 2018. As of 2021, demolition has started on part of the estate at Dart Close and Firs Close.

==History==
Warren Wood is a secondary woodland of birch, oak and pine with a large meadow, between Nine Mile Ride and Warren Lane. It includes a scheduled monument, a round burial mound, which is the largest example of a bell barrow in Berkshire and dates from between 2000 and 1300 BC. Trees have been removed from the mound in recent years as their roots can damage archaeological remains and paths have been re-routed around the mound.

The area between California and Crowthorne is sometimes known &#x27;The Rides&#x27; due to several straight roads cut through this part of Windsor Forest by Queen Anne and King George III. Others include Barkham Ride, Heath Ride and Gorse Ride.

The area stands on London clay and, to the west, there was a small brickworks around Kiln Ride, with a light railway connecting it to the railway between Wokingham and Crowthorne. It was called the California Brickworks and the village is named after it.

Longmoor Lake at California Country Park was expanded from a small pond by John Walter for the building of Bearwood House. The country park was originally a famous holiday camp, called &#x27;California in England&#x27;, complete with glass-floored pavilion and speedway racetrack. The track was known as Longmoor before the Second World War and was used for training. After the Second World War the track was home for the team known as California Poppies which raced in the Southern Area League. Annual reunions are now staged at the site of the track.

==Natural environment==
The village has a nature reserve on its edge called Shepperlands Farm Nature Reserve.

The village also has a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Local Nature Reserve called Longmoor Bog, which is part of California Country Park.

<text>Song Yoon-ah (, born June 7, 1973) is a South Korean actress. She is best known for starring in the film &quot;Jail Breakers&quot; (2002), as well as the television dramas &quot;Hotelier&quot; (2001), &quot;On Air&quot; (2008), &quot;Mama&quot; (2014), &quot;The K2&quot; (2016), and &quot;Secret Mother&quot; (2018).

==Early life and education==
Song Yoon-ah was born in Seoul, but spent her childhood in Gimcheon, North Gyeongsang Province. She has two elder brothers, the first one is a doctor. 

While studying cultural anthropology as a freshman at Hanyang University, she was recommended by an older schoolmate to a modeling agency. Song made her entertainment debut when she won three awards at the KBS Super Talent Contest in 1995, and began appearing in magazine advertisements and as an extra on TV shows.

==Career==
In 1998, Song rose to fame as the antagonist in &quot;Mister Q&quot;, playing the head of the design department in an underwear company who bullies the heroine; the trendy drama was a big hit, with a peak viewership rating of 45.3%. Over the next few years, Song became well known for her roles in TV dramas such as &quot;Paper Crane&quot; (1998), &quot;The Boss&quot; (1999), and &quot;Hotelier&quot; (2001).

Her first few films did not make a significant impression at the box office. But in late 2002, Song starred in one of the bigger commercial hits of the year, &quot;Jail Breakers&quot; with actors Sul Kyung-gu and Cha Seung-won. Her energetic performance in Kim Sang-jin&#x27;s comedy was recognized with Best Supporting Actress trophies from the Blue Dragon Film Awards, the Chunsa Film Art Awards, and the Grand Bell Awards. Song next played an anthropologist from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation in the 2004 horror film &quot;Face&quot;.

In 2006, she reunited onscreen with Sol Kyung-gu in &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, a low-key melodrama directed by Choo Chang-min about two college friends who drift apart and reconnect over the course of ten years. &quot;Arang&quot; followed, in which Song played a detective on the trail of a serial killer; this was her first time to get top billing over a male costar (rookie actor Lee Dong-wook). But like &quot;Face&quot;, her previous project in the horror genre, &quot;Arang&quot; was a commercial and critical failure. Song returned to television with &quot;My Beloved Sister&quot;, in the title role of a graduate art student who grew up wealthy but must suddenly take on the responsibilities as head of the family and take care of her younger brothers after their father goes bankrupt then disappears.

Her next hit drama came in 2008 with &quot;On Air&quot;, a behind-the-scenes look at the Korean entertainment industry. Song was cast in the role of scribe Kim Eun-sook&#x27;s alter ego, a successful, acerbic screenwriter who clashes egos with a top actress (played by Kim Ha-neul) while falling for a TV director (played by Park Yong-ha). Then in the 2009 thriller &quot;Secret&quot;, Song played the wife of a homicide detective—she becomes the prime suspect in a brutal murder he&#x27;s investigating, while in the 2010 tearjerker &quot;Wedding Dress&quot;, her character is a widowed designer who is diagnosed with cancer and begins sewing the ultimate parting gift, a special dress for her young daughter&#x27;s wedding, which she will never get to see.

After getting married in 2009 and giving birth in 2010, Song went on a five-year hiatus from acting. She became an adjunct professor and part-time lecturer at Seoul Arts College in 2010, as a faculty member of the Department of Performing Arts and the Department of Broadcasting, Entertainment and Visual Arts. Apart from occasional stints as an awards ceremony host (she hosted the Korean Film Awards from 2003 to 2010), in 2011 she also joined the cooking show &quot;Food Essay&quot; on cable channel Olive, and served as a judge on the first season of talent-reality show &quot;Korea&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

Song made her acting comeback in the 2014 drama series &quot;Mama&quot;, which revolved around a terminally ill single mother&#x27;s quest to find a loving family for her son before her impending death, leading to her befriending the current wife of a former lover. Her performance won Best Television Actress at the 51st Baeksang Arts Awards.

In 2016, Song played a villain in action drama &quot;The K2&quot;.

In 2017, she returned to the big screen and acted as a war correspondent in VR film &quot;Nine Days&quot;. The film is planned to exhibit in Sundance Film Festival, Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival. The same year, she was cast in the film &quot;Stone&quot;, her first feature film in 7 years. And the film has invited to the 23rd Busan International Film Festival.

In 2018, Song was cast in SBS mystery family drama &quot;Secret Mother&quot;.

Song then starred in JTBC&#x27;s 2020 pre-produced 19+ age-restricted series &quot;Graceful Friends&quot;.

Song was cast in Channel A&#x27;s series for the first time with melodrama mystery &quot;Show Window: The Queen&#x27;s House&quot;.

In 2023, Song reunited with Director Park Hye-ryeong for web show Song Yoon-ah by PDC.

== Other activities ==

=== Philanthropy ===
On February 13, 2023, Song donated 50 million won to help 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, by donating money through Korea&#x27;s UNICEF Committee with participation in the Emergency Relief for Children Victims of the Earthquake in Turkey and Syria&#x27; programme along with Sul Kyung-gu.

<doc id="1157398" wikidata="Q311681" url="?curid=1157398" title="Who (Unix)">
<text>The standard Unix command codice_1 displays a list of users who are currently logged into the computer.

The codice_1 command is related to the command , which provides the same information but also displays additional data and statistics.

== History ==
A command that displays the names of users logged in was first implemented within Multics. Later, it appeared in Version 1 Unix and became part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. 

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Joseph Arceneaux, David MacKenzie, and Michael Stone.

== Specification ==
The Single UNIX Specification (SUS) specifies that codice_1 should list information about accessible users. The XSI extension also specifies that the data of the username, terminal, login time, process ID, and time since last activity occurred on the terminal, furthermore, an alternate system database used for user information can be specified as an optional argument to .

The command can be invoked with the arguments codice_5 or codice_6 (so it is invoked as codice_7 or codice_8), showing information about the current terminal only (see the command and the codice_9 option below, of which this invocation is equivalent).

== Usage ==
The SUS without extensions only specifies the following codice_9, codice_11, and codice_12 options, all other options are specified in the XSI extension.

:codice_13, process the system database used for user information with the codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, codice_11 and codice_12.
:codice_14, show time when system was last rebooted
:codice_15, show zombie processes and details
:codice_24, show column headers
:codice_16, show terminals where a user can log in
:codice_9, show information about the current terminal only
:codice_17, show active processes
:codice_28, quick format, show only names and the number of all users logged on, disables all other options; equivalent to users command line utility
:codice_18, show runlevel of the init process.
:codice_30, (default) show only name, terminal, and time details
:codice_19, show when system clock was last changed
:codice_11, show details of each terminal in a standard format (see note in Examples section)
:codice_12, show idle time; XSI shows users logged in and displays information whether the terminal has been used recently or not

Other Unix and Unix-like operating systems may add extra options. GNU includes a codice_34 option behaving similarly to codice_12 and a codice_36 option displaying whether the user listed accepts messages (the SUS displays this when codice_11 is specified), yet GNU codice_1 and BSD codice_1 both omit a number of the above options (such as codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, and others); GNU codice_1 instead uses codice_16 to perform DNS lookups on hostnames listed.

== Output ==
The SUS without extensions specifies that the output format is to be &quot;implementation-defined&quot;. The XSI extension specifies a format, but notes that it is not fully specified; delimiters and field lengths are not precisely specified. Thus, the format of the output differs considerably among Unix implementations.

<doc id="1157399" wikidata="Q1309635" url="?curid=1157399" title="Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa">
<text>The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (&quot;Enuma Anu Enlil&quot; Tablet 63) is the record of astronomical positions for Venus, as preserved in numerous cuneiform tablets dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King Ammisaduqa (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after Hammurabi. Thus, the origins of this text could probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC (according to the Middle Chronology) despite allowing two possible dates.

The tablet gives the rise times of Venus and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the heliacal risings and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These positions are given for a period of 21 years.

==Sources==
This Venus tablet is part of &quot;Enuma Anu Enlil&quot; (&quot;In the days of Anu and Enlil&quot;), a long text dealing with Babylonian astrology, which mostly consists of omens in the form of celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC cuneiform, part of the British Museum collections, was recovered from the library at Nineveh. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and George Smith as &quot;Enuma Anu Enlil&quot; Tablet 63, in &quot;Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences&quot; (&quot;The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia&quot;, volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups. The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source &quot;B&quot;, found at Kish in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while Sargon II was King of Assyria between 720 and 704 BC.

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original omens, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, Middle, Low and Ultra-Low Chronologies, were inferred for the beginning of the Venus positions: 1702 BC, 1646/1638 BC, 1582 BC and 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet&#x27;s significance for corroborating Babylonian chronology was first recognised by Franz Xaver Kugler in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic &quot;Year of the Golden Throne&quot; (&quot;Venus&quot; tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.
Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support several chronologies in the 2nd millennium BC.

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical positions of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets. Some copying corruptions are probable. Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by Vahe Gurzadyan in a 2003 publication. The entry for some years, notably 13 and 21 are not physically possible and are considered in error. Also, the tables used to calculate the heliacal rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing &quot;clock-time errors&quot;.

<text>Stella Stevens (born Estelle Caro Eggleston; October 1, 1938 – February 17, 2023) was an American actress. She was the mother of actor Andrew Stevens.

Stevens began her acting career in 1959 in film &quot;Say One for Me&quot;, winning the Golden Globe Award for &quot;New Star of the Year - Actress&quot;. She appeared in three Playboy Pictorials and was named &quot;Playmate of the Month&quot; for January 1960.
She starred in films such as &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot; (1962), &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963), &quot;How to Save a Marriage and Ruin Your Life&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) and also appeared in several television series. Stevens also worked as film producer, director, and writer.

==Early life==
Born Estelle Caro Eggleston on October 1, 1938, in Yazoo City, Mississippi, she was the only child of Thomas Ellett Eggleston, an insurance salesman, and his wife, Estelle (née Caro) Eggleston, a nurse who was sometimes called by the nickname &quot;Dovey&quot;. One of the younger Estelle Eggleston&#x27;s great-grandfathers was Henry Clay Tyler, an early settler from Boston and a jeweler who gave the Yazoo City courthouse cupola its clock.

When Stella Stevens was four, her parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee; they lived on Carrington Road, near Highland Street, in the city. She attended St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic School which is on Highland Street and Sacred Heart School on Jefferson Avenue graduating from high school in 1955 at the Memphis Evening School at Memphis Technical High School.

At age 16, she married electrician Noble Herman Stephens, on December 3, 1954, in Holly Springs, Mississippi. They moved to Memphis, where their only child, Herman Andrew Stephens (later Andrew Stevens) was born on June 10, 1955. The couple divorced in 1957.

While studying at Memphis State University, Stella became interested in acting and modeling. According to her official biography, &quot;Her schooling in Memphis included a couple of years at Memphis State University, where she was noticed in the school play &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. The &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot; review of that performance in Memphis sparked her career.&quot;

Stevens was modelling and working for Goldsmith&#x27;s department store in Memphis when she signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox in 1958 with Buddy Adler and Dick Powell considering her for a film based on the life of Jean Harlow. She made her film debut in &quot;Say One for Me&quot; (1959), a modest musical produced by and starring Bing Crosby, appearing in the minor role of a chorus girl. Stevens&#x27; contract with Fox was dropped after six months. After winning the role of Appassionata Von Climax in the musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959), she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures (1959-1963). In 1960, she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance in &quot;Say One for Me&quot;, sharing the distinction with fellow up-and-comers Tuesday Weld, Angie Dickinson, and Janet Munro.

In 1961, she starred opposite Bobby Darin in John Cassavetes&#x27; &quot;Too Late Blues&quot;, and in 1962, she starred opposite Elvis Presley in &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot;.

In 1963 she appeared in two successful comedy films: &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; starring comedian Jerry Lewis, where she plays his student and love interest Stella Purdy, and in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, playing the would-be &quot;Miss Montana&quot; beauty queen.

In 1964, she signed a four-year contract with Columbia Pictures. Following appearances in &quot;Synanon&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1965), Stevens starred as a sexy but clumsy government agent opposite Dean Martin in the Matt Helm spy spoof &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966). Her last film for Columbia was &quot;Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows&quot; (1968) in which she played a young nun, Sister George, &quot;who understands and sympathizes with the rebellious students&quot; at a girls&#x27; Catholic boarding school.

In 1970, Stevens starred opposite Jason Robards in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;, for which she received positive reviews. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Roger Greenspun wrote, &quot;But it is Stella Stevens, at last in a role good enough for her, who most wonderfully sustains and enlightens the action.&quot; In 1972, she co-starred (and filmed her last nude appearance) with Jim Brown in the blaxploitation movie &quot;Slaughter&quot;, later in the year costarring in Irwin Allen&#x27;s hugely successful disaster film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, starring Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Roddy McDowall, and Shelley Winters. Stevens played the role of Linda Rogo, the &quot;refreshingly outspoken&quot; ex-prostitute wife of Borgnine&#x27;s character. In 1986, she appeared in &quot;Monster in the Closet&quot;.

Although she continued to appear in feature films for the next four decades, Stevens shifted the focus of her career to television series, miniseries, and telemovies.

==Television career==

Stevens appeared in several top television series in the 1960s, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1960), &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; (1960, 1961), and &quot;Ben Casey&quot; (1964). One of her earliest television appearances was in a critically acclaimed 1960 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Silent Thunder&quot;; she played a deaf-mute.

In the early 1970s, she began working regularly on television series, miniseries, and movies. She appeared in episodes of popular series such as &quot;Ghost Story (TV series)&quot; (1972), &quot;Banacek&quot; (1973) and &quot;Police Story&quot; (1975), as well as the pilot films for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (1975), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977), and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979). In 1979, she appeared along with her son Andrew Stevens in &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; (1977) episode &quot;Hannah&#x27;s Girl&quot;.

During the 1980s, she continued to work regularly on series including &quot;Newhart&quot; (1983), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1983), &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1983), &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; (1984), &quot;Night Court&quot; (1984), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1985), &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1986), and &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; (1987). Stevens appears in 34 episodes of the primetime soap opera &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1981–82), as Lute-Mae Sanders, the former madam of a brothel. During a 1988 interview she commented on her role as a madam in &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;, saying that, &quot;The truth of the matter is that I&#x27;ve always been type cast, but I don&#x27;t mind because hookers are among the few roles that require glamorous wardrobes, feathers and jewelry.&quot;

From 1989 to 1990, she had a role on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as Phyllis Blake. Her string of appearances on popular television series continued into the 1990s with &quot;The Commish&quot; (1993), &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (1994), &quot;&quot; (1995), &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; (1996), and &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1996, 1999). She also appeared in the critically acclaimed miniseries &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1996).

==Additional work==
In January 1960, she was &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s Playmate of the Month and was also featured in &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorials in 1965 and 1968. She was included in &quot;Playboy&quot;″s 100 Sexiest Stars of the 20th Century, appearing at number 27. During the 1960s, she was one of the most photographed women in the world.

In 1974, she sued &quot;Playboy&quot; and Hugh Hefner for $7 million, claiming that they had published pictures of her for 15 years without her consent, some of which depicted her &quot;in a highly degrading and humiliating manner&quot; and that she had lost numerous film roles due to the image portrayed of her by &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Speaking about her Playboy features, Stevens told The New York Times, &quot;If you&#x27;ve got ten million people seeing you in a layout like that ... and half of them remember the name &#x27;Stella Stevens&#x27;, they&#x27;ll buy tickets for your movies.&quot;

Stevens appeared in several stage productions, including a touring production of an all-female version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; opposite Sandy Dennis. Stevens played the Oscar Madison character. She directed feature film &quot;The Ranch&quot; (1989) and produced and directed &quot;The American Heroine&quot; (1979). In 1999, she co-wrote a novel, &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;, about a Memphis-born singer named Johnny Gault.
==Personal life==
Stevens was married to Noble Herman Stephens from 1954, when she was 16, until their divorce in 1957. Their son Andrew was born in 1955. Following her divorce she changed the spelling of her last name to &#x27;Stevens&#x27; and left her son in the custody of her parents while she sought out a successful acting career. In the years following, she and her former husband engaged in a custody battle for their son, with each party accusing the other of kidnapping, before Stevens finally won full custody. Her son&#x27;s professional name is Andrew Stevens.

In late 1976, Stevens purchased a ranch in Methow Valley near Carlton, Washington, on the eastern edge of the Cascade Mountains. She also opened an art gallery and bakery in the nearby small town of Twisp, Washington.

In 1983, Stevens began a long-term relationship with rock guitarist Bob Kulick. A little over a year later, he moved into Stevens&#x27; Beverly Hills home. In March 2016, Kulick and Stevens sold her longtime Beverly Hills home, and she moved to a long-term Alzheimer&#x27;s care facility in Los Angeles. Kulick often visited her there until his death on May 28, 2020.

==Death==
Stevens died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Los Angeles on February 17, 2023, at the age of 84.

<doc id="1157408" wikidata="Q549855" url="?curid=1157408" title="VHS-C">
<text>VHS-C is the compact variant of the VHS videocassette format, introduced by Victor Company of Japan (JVC) in 1982, and used primarily for consumer-grade compact analog recording camcorders. The format is based on the same video tape as is used in VHS, and can be played back in a standard VHS VCR with an adapter. An improved version named S-VHS-C was also developed. S-VHS&#x27;s main competitor was Video8; however, both became obsolete in the marketplace by the digital video formats MiniDV and MiniDVD, which have smaller form factors.

== Technical info ==
The magnetic tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool and used a gear wheel which moves the tape forward. It can also be moved by hand. This development hampered the sales of the Betamax system somewhat, because the Betamax cassette geometry prevented a similar development.

VHS-C cassettes have a switch to inhibit recording of a cassette. Not all adapters propagate the state of this switch to the VCR itself, so accidental erasure of a write-protected cassette is possible if the adapter&#x27;s write protect lug or switch allows it.

=== VHS-C head drum ===
To reduce the size of cameras, the VHS-C mechanism uses a two-thirds size head drum (41.3 mm diameter instead of the original VHS drum size of 62 mm). The wrap angle is 270 degrees instead of VHS&#x27;s 180 degrees. The drum rotates at a proportionately higher speed, and four rotary video heads are used to trace out exactly the same helical recording path as a standard sized VHS drum.
By adding more heads, the same small VHS-C drum can record and playback FM Hi-Fi audio that is also fully compatible with a standard sized Hi-Fi video drum

== Adapter for VHS VCRs ==
VHS-C cassette was larger than Video8 cassette, but was compatible with VHS tape recorders, using a special adapter cassette. The adapter contains a standard full-size engagement hub for the VCR&#x27;s takeup sprocket, which connected to a gear train to drive the VHS-C cassette takeup gear.

VHS end of tape is normally detected by a light in the VCR that inserts into the full-size cassette body, and detected by sensors in the VCR located at the far outer corners of the front of the cassette. Because the width of VHS-C is narrower than a full-size VHS cassette and does not align with the full-size end of tape sensors, the adapter has a guide roller swing arm to pull tape out of the VHS-C cartridge out to the far right edge where it would normally be located in a full-size cassette. When the VHS-C cartridge is to be removed from the adapter, a geared retraction system pulls in the excess loose tape when the swing arm retracts.

== Comparison to Video8 ==
VHS-C had similar video quality as Video8, but a significantly shorter run time. During the 1980s, 20-minute VHS-C cassettes were the norm. In 1989 JVC increased the run time to 30 minutes by using thinner tape. Later, JVC offered 45-minute and 60-minute cassettes. For comparison, 120-minute 8-mm cassettes became available in the late 1985 and quickly became the norm. Later, 150-minute and 180-minute 8-mm cassettes were offered as well.

The later Hi8 and S-VHS-C systems both have a quality similar to the LaserDisc system.

Although DV video was ported to 8-mm hardware in 1999 to become Digital8, D-VHS was never adapted to a compact VHS format.

== S-VHS-C ==
A higher quality version of VHS-C was released, based on S-VHS, known as S-VHS-C, that competed against Hi8, the higher quality version of Video8. The arrival on the market of inexpensive S-VHS-C camcorders led to the inclusion on many modern VCRs of a feature known as SQPB, or SuperVHS Quasi-PlayBack, but did not make a significant impact on the market as the arrival of MiniDV as a consumer standard made low-cost, digital, near-broadcast quality video widely available to consumers, and rendered analog camcorders largely obsolete.

==Slackening Problem==
Early VHS-C cassettes did not have a mechanism to ratchet or lock the supply reel when not in use, making them susceptible to spilling tape inside the shell. Consequently, manufacturers placed a label on their camcorders and adapters to warn the user to check that the tape is not slackened before inserting a cassette. The user could dissipate the slack by manually turning the take-up gear. Later cassettes corrected this problem by adding teeth to the supply reel to lock it in place when no upward pressure is applied. The spindle of the camcorder or VCR supplies pressure to float the reel&#x27;s turntable and teeth above the shell, allowing it to rotate freely when in use.

If a tape with slack was loaded into a VHS-C adapter, the tape could sit on the wrong side of a tape guide when the adapter loaded. The result would be a tape and cassette combination that would not play in a video deck, and would damage the tape to some extent when being unloaded.

<text>The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (informally the National Hospital or Queen Square) is a neurological hospital in Queen Square, London. It is part of the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It was the first hospital to be established in England dedicated exclusively to treating the diseases of the nervous system. It is closely associated with University College London (UCL) and in partnership with the UCL Institute of Neurology, which occupies the same site, is a major centre for neuroscience research.

==History==
The hospital was founded by Johanna Chandler as the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic at Queen Square in 1859. The hospital was completely rebuilt in the early 1880s: the East Wing was re-opened by Princess Helena in 1881 and the West Wing was re-opened by the Prince of Wales in 1885. In 1904, it adopted the name National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of the Paralysed and Epileptic.

The hospital served as a section of the First London General Hospital during the First World War and was renamed the National Hospital, Queen Square, for the Relief and Cure of Diseases of the Nervous System including Paralysis and Epilepsy by supplementary Royal Charter in 1926. The Queen Mary Wing was opened by Queen Mary in July 1938. During the Second World War the hospital was badly damaged by German bombing.

The hospital merged with the Maida Vale Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System (founded by Julius Althaus as the London Infirmary for Epilepsy and Paralysis in 1866) in 1948, becoming the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. The current name came into use in 1990. The hospital became part of University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in 1996.

==Services==
The hospital includes 244 in-patient beds, and has nine operating theatres (including two angiography theatres). The neurology wards are named John Young and David Ferrier; the neurosurgical wards are named Victor Horsley, Bernard Sunley and Lady Ann Allerton. Nuffield ward accommodates private medical and surgical inpatients. There are neurological and neurosurgical intensive care units in the hospital. The two inpatient rehabilitation units are the Albany Rehabilitation Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit. The main outpatient department is named in memory of Basil Samuels.

<text>The Magnetawan River is a long river in Parry Sound District, Ontario, Canada. The river flows 175 km from its source of Magnetawan Lake inside Algonquin Provincial Park to empty into Georgian Bay at the community of Britt on Byng Inlet. 

The name of the river means &quot;swiftly flowing waters&quot; in the Ojibwa language.

At the end of the 19th century, the river was used to float white pine logs to sawmills . The river gained recent renown when it was featured in Bill Mason&#x27;s film Waterwalker.

The river has numerous rapids, such as, &quot;The Thirty Dollar Rapids&quot;, &quot;The Fourteen&quot;, &quot;The Ten&quot;, the &quot;Potato Rapids&quot;, &quot;Poverty Bay Chutes&quot;, and &quot;Cody Rapids&quot;.

The town of Magnetawan is located on the river between Lake Cecebe and Ahmic Lake. Locks were built here on the river to allow steamboats to travel further down the river from the railway station at Burk&#x27;s Falls. The locks officially opened on July 8, 1886 and are still in use today.

There is an Ojibwe community with the name Magnetawan First Nation, the same name as the river. The community is on reserve lands on the river just east of Byng Inlet.

== Canoe routes ==
The Magnetawan River also provides great canoe routes for novice and more experienced canoe tripping. Canadian Canoe Routes lists three Magnetawan River Canoe Routes:
*Magnetawan River South Branch (35 km)
*Magnetawan River North Branch (43 km)
*Magnetawan River Loop No.2 (80 km)

<doc id="1157419" wikidata="Q962747" url="?curid=1157419" title="Rawhi Fattouh">
<text>Rawhi Fattuh (, , also transliterated as Rauhi Fattouh; born 23 August 1949) is the current Chairman of Palestinian Legislative Council, having held the position since February 2020. He had previously held the same position in 2004, and for that reason he became the interim President of the Palestinian Authority, following the death of Yasser Arafat on 11 November 2004, until 15 January 2005. Under Palestinian law, he held the Presidency only until elections were held. The elections were held and won by Mahmoud Abbas, who was sworn in on 15 January 2005. Fattuh was again elected to the Central Committee of Fatah in December 2016.

==Biography==
Fattuh was elected in 1996 as a representative to the Palestinian Legislative Council of the town of Rafah (in the Gaza Strip), where he was born and has lived for most of his life. He served as secretary to the PLC until October 2003, when he became the minister of agriculture in the government of Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia.

In July 2004, Fatah nominated Fattuh as its candidate for Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, with 34 Fatah delegates voting in favour and 10 against.

In November 2004, Fattuh supported Ahmed Qurei, his predecessor as speaker and former prime minister, to succeed Arafat as president.

Fattuh was sworn in as interim President of the Palestinian National Authority on 11 November 2004 after the death of Arafat. After taking the oath, Fattuh praised Arafat as a martyr of the Palestinian people and promised to faithfully follow Arafat&#x27;s policies.

Fattuh did not run in the 2006 legislative election and is no longer a member of the PLC.

In 2022, Fattouh chaired the 18-member Fatah-dominated PLO Executive Committee. Fattouh, a member of the PNC&#x27;s founding generation, was considered by analysts to be dull and lacking any political influence to actually rule.

Israel revoked the entry permits to Israel for Fattouh and two other senior Palestinian officials in January 2023 after they visited Karim Younis, who was freed from prison after being convicted of murdering an Israeli soldier in 1980.

On 30 November 2024, Fattouh was nominated by Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas to assume the presidency in the event of his incapacity.

==Views==
At an event in Algeria in 2023, Fattuh claimed that Arabs had inhabited Jerusalem for over 1.5 million years, while Jews had only been in the Middle East for 6,000 years. The oldest human fossils found date to around 300,000 years ago, 1.2 million years later than Fattouh&#x27;s claim.

<doc id="1157422" wikidata="Q900846" url="?curid=1157422" title="Virial expansion">
<text>The virial expansion is a model of thermodynamic equations of state. It expresses the pressure of a gas in local equilibrium as a power series of the density. This equation may be represented in terms of the compressibility factor, , as
formula_1
This equation was first proposed by Kamerlingh Onnes. The terms , , and represent the virial coefficients. The leading coefficient is defined as the constant value of 1, which ensures that the equation reduces to the ideal gas expression as the gas density approaches zero. 

== Second and third virial coefficients ==
The second, , and third, , virial coefficients have been studied extensively and tabulated for many fluids for more than a century. Two of the most extensive compilations are in the books by Dymond and the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s Thermo Data Engine Database and its Web Thermo Tables. Tables of second and third virial coefficients of many fluids are included in these compilations.

== Casting equations of the state into virial form ==

Most equations of state can be reformulated and cast in virial equations to evaluate and compare their implicit second and third virial coefficients. The seminal van der Waals equation of state was proposed in 1873:
formula_2
where is molar volume. It can be rearranged by expanding into a Taylor series:
formula_3

In the van der Waals equation, the second virial coefficient has roughly the correct behavior, as it decreases monotonically when the temperature is lowered. The third and higher virial coefficients are independent of temperature, and are not correct, especially at low temperatures. 

Almost all subsequent equations of state are derived from the van der Waals equation, like those from Dieterici, Berthelot, Redlich-Kwong, and Peng-Robinson suffer from the singularity introduced by .

Other equations of state, started by Beattie and Bridgeman, are more closely related to virial equations, and show to be more accurate in representing behavior of fluids in both gaseous and liquid phases. The Beattie-Bridgeman equation of state, proposed in 1928, 
formula_4
where
*formula_5
*formula_6
can be rearranged as
formula_7The Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state of 1940 represents better isotherms below the critical temperature:
formula_8

More improvements were achieved by Starling in 1972:
formula_9

Following are plots of reduced second and third virial coefficients against reduced temperature according to Starling:

The exponential terms in the last two equations correct the third virial coefficient so that the isotherms in the liquid phase can be represented correctly. The exponential term converges rapidly as ρ increases, and if only the first two terms in its Taylor expansion series are taken, formula_10, and multiplied with formula_11, the result is formula_12, which contributes a formula_13 term to the third virial coefficient, and one term to the eighth virial coefficient, which can be ignored.

After the expansion of the exponential terms, the Benedict-Webb-Rubin and Starling equations of state have this form:
formula_14

== Cubic virial equation of state ==
The three-term virial equation or a cubic virial equation of state
formula_15
has the simplicity of the Van der Waals equation of state without its singularity at . Theoretically, the second virial coefficient represents bimolecular attraction forces, and the third virial term represents the repulsive forces among three molecules in close contact.

With this cubic virial equation, the coefficients B and C can be solved in closed form. Imposing the critical conditions:
formula_16
the cubic virial equation can be solved to yield:
formula_17 formula_18 and formula_19
formula_20 is therefore 0.333, compared to 0.375 from the Van der Waals equation.

Between the critical point and the triple point is the saturation region of fluids. In this region, the gaseous phase coexists with the liquid phase under saturation pressure formula_21, and the saturation temperature formula_22. Under the saturation pressure, the liquid phase has a molar volume of formula_23, and the gaseous phase has a molar volume of formula_24. The corresponding molar densities are formula_25 and formula_26. These are the saturation properties needed to compute second and third virial coefficients.

A valid equation of state must produce an isotherm which crosses the horizontal line of formula_21 at formula_23 and formula_24, on formula_22. Under formula_21 and formula_22, gas is in equilibrium with liquid. This means that the PρT isotherm has three roots at formula_21. The cubic virial equation of state at formula_22 is: 
formula_35
It can be rearranged as:
formula_36
The factor formula_37 is the volume of saturated gas according to the ideal gas law, and can be given a unique name formula_38:
formula_39
In the saturation region, the cubic equation has three roots, and can be written alternatively as:
formula_40
which can be expanded as:
formula_41
formula_42 is a volume of an unstable state between formula_23 and formula_24. The cubic equations are identical. Therefore, from the linear terms in these equations, formula_45 can be solved:
formula_46
From the quadratic terms, &quot;B&quot; can be solved:
formula_47
And from the cubic terms, &quot;C&quot; can be solved:
formula_48
Since formula_23, formula_24 and formula_21 have been tabulated for many fluids with formula_22 as a parameter, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; can be computed in the saturation region of these fluids. The results are generally in agreement with those computed from Benedict-Webb-Rubin and Starling equations of state.

<text>Printronix is an American supplier of Industrial Print Solutions, Industrial Laser Printers and line and dot matrix printers. Printronix is based in Irvine, California, and operates across 14 offices worldwide.

==Products==
Printronix&#x27;s printers are primarily used in industrial environments for printing high-volume labels, bar-codes, invoices, manifest and bill of lading documents, delivery sheets, reports, build/broadcast sheets, green bar and bank statements.

PrintNet Enterprise Suite (PNE), a web-based application allowing administrators to network and manage all Printronix line-matrix printers from a single computer, was launched in 2007.

Printronix also offers consumables, parts, accessories, service and software.

==History==
Printronix was founded in 1974 by Robert A. Kleist and business partners Gordon B. Barrus and David Mayne. 

Barrus realized there was a capital need for businesses to store all their data via printing, so he quit his job at Data Products and started a company he named Eikon, marketing industrial-grade printers to businesses to fulfill this need. The company was not successful and Gordon regrouped to found the startup Printronix.
In the spring of 1974, in a garage in Playa del Rey, California, seven high technology pioneers got together and started a new company. 
They were Gordon Barrus (RIP), Leo Emenaker (RIP), Robert A Kleist, Dave Mayne, Ray Melissa, Rafael Patiño and Glen Radke (RIP).

Initially working out of Leo Emenaker&#x27;s garage in Playa Del Rey, California, Barrus developed and invented what he christened as the P300, a 300-line-per-minute (LPM) prototype line printer series.

The company would eventually incorporate, go public on the Nasdaq, and experience great success in the ensuing years with the emergence of the personal computer.

<text>Tautra is an island in Frosta Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is located in the Trondheimsfjord, just north of the city of Trondheim. The island is connected to the rest of the municipality by a long causeway bridge.
The island is located almost in the middle of the Trondheimsfjord, in the heartland of what once was the central area of the Vikings. There are remains of the medieval Tuterø Abbey, a Cistercian monastery, that was established here in 1207 and dissolved during the Protestant Reformation. The monastery was placed strategically, very close to the Frostating assembly site—the central law-making institution in this region of Norway. In that context, the Cistercian monks of Tautra monastery became a part of the nation-building in Norway. In 2003, Queen Sonja laid the cornerstone of Tautra Abbey, a new Cistercian nunnery on the island.

A large part of the island and its surrounding water is designated as protected under the Ramsar Convention due to the rich bird life in the area. Now, there are organized professional guided tours for bird watching as well as about the nature and history on Tautra.

<text>Hall of the Mountain Grill is the fourth studio album by space rock band Hawkwind, released in 1974. It is regarded by many critics as a career highlight.

==Overview==
The group&#x27;s fourth studio album, it was the first by a new line-up that included Simon House on synthesizer, Mellotron and electric violin; absent were Robert Calvert, who had previously contributed lyrics, vocals and spoken word interludes, and Dik Mik, who provided electronic effects.

The album&#x27;s title was a nod to Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and to a Portobello Road cafe called The Mountain Grill (now closed), frequented by the band and their contemporaries from the Ladbroke Grove scene in the early 1970s. Hawkwind&#x27;s frequent solo support act and occasional live guest musician Steve Peregrin Took had a song &quot;The Ballad of the Mountain Grill,&quot; released in 1995 on a Cleopatra Records CD under alternative title &quot;Flophouse Blues (in the Mountain Grill)&quot;. At one point, underground newspaper &quot;International Times&quot; had its printworks in the upstairs of the Grill.

The cover of a derelict spaceship in the mists of an alien lagoon was painted by the band&#x27;s regular artistic collaborator, Barney Bubbles. The rear cover was by David A. Hardy.

The record featured hard rockers like &quot;The Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear in Smoke)&quot; and &quot;Lost Johnny&quot; (subsequently recorded by bassist Lemmy&#x27;s post-Hawkwind band Motörhead and also by co-writer Mick Farren with his band The Deviants), psychedelia such as the heavily phased &quot;D-Rider&quot; and &quot;Web Weaver&quot;, as well as quieter atmospheric numbers like the instrumentals &quot;Goat Willow&quot;, &quot;Wind of Change&quot; and the title track. Side two of the original vinyl LP was bookended by &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot; and &quot;Paradox&quot;, live tracks recorded at the Edmonton Sundown in January 1974, that recalled the &#x27;space jams&#x27; of earlier releases.

In the wake of Robert Calvert&#x27;s departure, lead vocals for the album were performed by Dave Brock, along with Lemmy on &quot;Lost Johnny&quot; and Nik Turner on &quot;D-Rider&quot;. The band&#x27;s line-up would continue to shift during the year. Del Dettmar left prior to the release of &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot; to live in Canada, and Alan Powell joined as an additional drummer. Science fiction author and friend of the group Michael Moorcock stepped in to read poetry at their concerts.

Jonathan Smeeton (Liquid Len) has stated that Brock specifically wrote &quot;Wind of Change&quot; for a particular slide sequence he had on the Space Ritual tour (a tree being engulfed by a city, then the city collapsing with the tree remaining).

At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Simon King stated &quot;The &quot;Doremi&quot; album lacked production. I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; either. But the new one – I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. I like side one because I think it&#x27;s something we haven&#x27;t done before. Yeah – I&#x27;m pleased with half of the new album.&quot; Lemmy later commented that &quot;For me, this was when the band were at their height. Oh, and I was in the band at the time.&quot; (&quot;Classic Rock&quot;, April 2006), listing it as No. 3 in &quot;My Top British Rock Albums&quot;.

==Live performances and recording==
After the release of the successful live album &quot;Space Ritual&quot; and single &quot;Urban Guerrilla&quot; in 1973, vocalist Robert Calvert and electronics player Dik Mik Davies left, leaving the group as a five-piece. In November and December 1973, Hawkwind undertook their first live tour of North America taking in ten dates. During this time, Del Dettmar bought land near Calgary in Canada and signalled to the group his intent that he and his pregnant wife were to emigrate.

The group continued touring heavily around Britain and Ireland from December into February under the banner &quot;The Ridiculous Roadshow with the Silly Hawkwind Brothers&quot;. By this time, their live set had been revamped and contained what would become the bulk of this album. Two dates on 25 and 26 January at the Edmonton Sundown were used as an opportunity to audition Simon House as Dettmar&#x27;s replacement, House having been known to the group via his time with High Tide, who had shared the same management company of Douglas Smith&#x27;s Clearwater Productions. These dates were professionally recorded, with the performances of &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot;, &quot;Paradox&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; appearing on the album and singles, albeit with studio overdubs.

The group returned to North America a second time for a more comprehensive tour consisting of 22 dates in March and April under the banner of &quot;1999 Party&quot;, taking their entire entourage with them including dancer Stacia, MC and DJ Andy Dunkley, a lightshow by Jonathan Smeeton (Liquid Len) and support from United Artists Records label mates Man. Although Dettmar had not yet left the group, House joined the band for this tour, but not having the appropriate work permit, his performances were strictly unofficial. The Chicago and Detroit shows on 21 and 23 March were professionally recorded, the former being released in 1997 as &quot;The 1999 Party&quot;.

Returning to England, the band went to Clearwell Castle to rehearse, then entered Olympic Studios to record this album in May and June, with help from producers Doug Bennett and Roy Thomas Baker. The lead singles &quot;Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear in Smoke)&quot; (coupled with &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;) in the UK and an alternative version of &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot; (coupled with &quot;Paradox&quot;) in France were issued on 2 August, followed by the album on 6 September. Alternative studio versions of &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot; and &quot;Wind of Change&quot; were later released in 2011 on &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;.

A nine date European tour at the end of June was undertaken. However, drummer Simon King had cracked some ribs playing football, prohibiting his participation, so nominated his friend Alan Powell to deputise for him on the dates. By the end of tour, King had recuperated sufficiently to resume playing alongside Powell, and the group were happy enough with the arrangement of two drummers that Powell was pulled into the group&#x27;s permanent line-up. At the completion of the tour, Dettmar finally departed.

The group returned for a third tour of North America in September, but on their fifth date at Hammond, Indiana on the 7th, their equipment was impounded by the IRS and they were issued a bill for unpaid taxes from their previous tour. An impasse ensued, and the band finally continued the tour a month later after all issues had been resolved.

==Reception==
&quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot; reached number 16 on the UK album charts and number 110 in the US. Its release was preceded by an edited single of &quot;The Psychedelic Warlords&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; in August. &quot;Paradox&quot; b/w &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot; was issued as a single in Europe, both sides also being edits. All four of these tracks appeared on EMI&#x27;s 2001 CD re-issue of the album. An EP featuring &quot;The Psychedelic Warlords&quot;, &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot;, &quot;D-Rider&quot; and &quot;Wind of Change&quot; was released as a promo in the US in 1974.

Retrospective reviews have been generally positive. Though they were critical of the title track, AllMusic called &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot; &quot;The band&#x27;s best studio album&quot; and &quot;the quintessential guitar-oriented space rock record&quot;. Head Heritage were far less impressed, contending that the departures of Robert Calvert and Dik Mik were losses that Hawkwind could not remotely compensate for, and that the entire album &quot;has the undeniable feel of a stop-gap album released half-desperately to keep the machinery of Hawkwind&#x27;s constant touring well-greased&quot;. They added, however, that the album&#x27;s two live tracks are highlights of the Hawkwind catalogue.
