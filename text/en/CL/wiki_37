<text>A mop (such as a floor mop) is a mass or bundle of coarse strings or yarn, etc., or a piece of cloth, sponge or other absorbent material, attached to a pole or stick. It is used to soak up liquid, for cleaning floors and other surfaces, to mop up dust, or for other cleaning purposes.

==History==
The word (then spelled &quot;mappe&quot;) is attested in English in 1496, but new refinements and variations of mop designs have been introduced, from time to time. For example, American inventor Jacob Howe received US patent #241 for a mop holder in 1837 and Thomas W. Stewart (US patent #499,402) in 1893.

In her book &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Memories&quot;, Margaret Wadkin (late of Hickling, near Melton Mowbray in England) describes the use of a mop nail for constructing homemade mops from old pieces of cloth during her village childhood in the early 20th century;
==Types==
Many different proprietary designs are available, but the classic string mop design is also still widely used.

===Dry mop, dust mop===
A dry mop or dust mop is designed to pick up dry, loose contamination such as dust, earth, and sand from the surface of the floor. It consists of yarn and/or microfiber and can be used as a first step in cleaning a floor.

Professional dry mops consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or sheets with a surface of looped yarn, usually about wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually ).

The dry mop can in many instances replace a broom and has the ability to hold a limited amount of dust, sand, and debris within itself. The heads of dry mops are often removable and can be washed and replaced when saturated with dust. Another option is using a vacuum cleaner to suck surface dust away from the mop; however, this is much more limited in its effectiveness.

Single-use dry mops are also available and widely sold.

===Wet-mop, moist-mop===
A wet mop or moist mop is, in professional cleaning, used as in the second step in the cleaning of a surface. The wet mop is swept over the surface to dissolve and absorb fat, mud, and dried-on liquid contaminations. Professional wet mops consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or a sheet with a surface of looped yarn (which might contain microfiber as well), usually about wide, and come in various lengths (usually ).

===Mops for pre-moistening===

Professional flat mops are made for pre-moistening. Mops are pre-impregnated with an ideal amount of water mixed with an appropriate amount of detergent. This means that the cleaner does not need to bring any additional water on the cleaning trolley. This ideal amount is often recommended by the manufacturer in terms of weight percentage of water per weight of the dry mop, for example &quot;175% water per weight of the dry mop&quot;.

Mops for pre-moistening are flat sheets of (often microfiber) textile, usually about wide, and come in variable lengths (usually ). Mops for pre-moistening are fastened on a handle with a flat pad mount with the aid of Velcro or a pouch on the mop, in which the pad on the handle fits.

Pre-moistening can be done with a special washing machine, or by hand by simply folding and packing the mops tight in a container and pouring the measured amount of water over them. The mops will then need about 5–10 minutes for the liquid to distribute evenly in their tissue before use. This offers some advantages:
* The cleaner does not have to bring a heavy bucket of water when mopping the floor, but simply carries an appropriate number of mops. This means the weight of the equipment can often be kept lower.
* The risk of over-wetting the floor and leaving puddles is reduced.

===Hot mop===
The hot mop (or steam mop) follows a similar concept to a steam iron. After adding water, the water is heated to make it exude on top of a floor, which can then be cleaned without using a cleaning solvent. These can work best on surfaces where a regular mop would also be used, such as bare floors, hearths, and laminate.

===Microfiber mop===
Microfiber mops are constructed of a blend of polyester and polyamide fibers which are &quot;split&quot; and formed into a single fiber. This blend consists of 70–90% polyester that serves as the scrubbing and cleaning fiber and 10–30% polyamide which performs as the holding and quick drying fiber. This blend is usually expressed as a ratio on the label of the mop, e.g. an 80% polyester and 20% polyamide blend would be labeled as &quot;80/20&quot;.

===Sponge mop===

Sponge mop heads are constructed with a cellulosic, rubber, or plastic foam block, usually attached by crimping a metal clip on one side. Sometimes, the foam mop head may be covered by a cloth or mesh sheet, to improve its resistance to wear from heavy scrubbing.

The sponge is then attached to a handle mechanism which can compress the mop head, by means of rollers or a pivoted flat perforated blade. For consumer-grade sponge mops, the mop mechanism may be made of either plastic or metal. For heavy-duty or professional use, the mechanism is usually made of a corrosion-resistant metal such as stainless steel, and the mop head is often rubber or premium plastic foam.

For clean room environments, a stainless steel handle and mechanism are preferred, along with a mop head made of a foam which has been formulated to minimize shedding of small particles. For use in microbiological labs, mops are made of materials which can be sterilized by autoclave or by ethylene oxide treatment.

===Cloth mop===
A cloth mop (also called a &quot;Cuban mop&quot;) is a simple T-shaped wooden handle, around which is wrapped a sturdy cloth towel. Its advantages are low cost and easy replacement of the mop head, which can simply be washed by hand or tossed into a washing machine.

==Handles and mounting==
A mop handle consists of a long piece of wood or metal tubing fitted with a specific attachment for the mop head. The handle can be attached the mop head by means of:
* clamp
* hanger (with strands doubled over the hanger)
* plastic claws (attached to the strands)
* pouch (as with many professional flat mops)
* screwing (as with the classic yarn mop)
* Velcro (as with many professional flat mops)

<doc id="1166241" wikidata="Q176918" url="?curid=1166241" title="Rupture of membranes">
<text>Rupture of membranes (ROM) or amniorrhexis is a term used during pregnancy to describe a rupture of the amniotic sac. Normally, it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. Rupture of the membranes is known colloquially as &quot;breaking (one&#x27;s) water,&quot; especially when induced rather than spontaneous, or as one&#x27;s &quot;water breaking&quot;. A premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a rupture of the amnion that occurs at full term and prior to the onset of labor. In cases of PROM, options include expectant management without intervention, or interventions such as oxytocin or other methods of labor induction, and both are usually accompanied by close monitoring of maternal and fetal health. Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is when water breaks both before the onset of labor and before the pregnancy&#x27;s 37 week gestation. In the United States, more than 120,000 pregnancies per year are affected by a premature rupture of membranes, which is the cause of about one third of preterm deliveries.

Sometimes, a child is born with no rupture of the amniotic sac (no rupture of membranes). In such cases, the child may still be entirely within the sac once born; such a birth is known as an en-caul birth.

==Effects==
When the amniotic sac ruptures, production of prostaglandins increases and the cushioning between the fetus and uterus is decreased, both of which are processes that increase the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions.

On occasion, with the rupture of membranes, particularly if the head is not engaged, the umbilical cord may prolapse. A cord prolapse is an obstetrical emergency, as the descending head may block fetal-placental circulation.

Once the membranes are ruptured, bacteria may ascend and could lead to amnionitis and fetal infection.

A premature rupture of membranes can have multiple effects on the fetus such as increasing their risk of prematurity and facing neonatal or perinatal complications.

Rupture of membranes can affect ongoing labor management. Certain methods of labor induction or augmentation such as balloon catheters are relatively contraindicated after ROM.

==Types==
*SROM: spontaneous rupture of membranes. This term describes the normal, spontaneous rupture of the membranes at full term. The rupture is usually at the bottom of the uterus, over the cervix, causing a gush of fluid. This gush may be quite small (such as 50ml), or it can be significantly large (200-300ml) depending upon amount of fluid in the amniotic sac, and to what extent the fetal head is plugging the hole and retaining fluid in the sac. A spontaneous rupture that occurs early in labor may actually be related to other complications resulting in delayed labor. These complications may include a contracted pelvis, breech presentation, or occipito-posterior position.
*PROM: premature rupture of membranes. This term describes a rupture of the membranes that occurs before the onset of labor.
**PPROM: preterm, premature rupture of membranes. This term describes a rupture of the membranes that occurs before 37 weeks gestation, and it can have multiple effects on the fetus such as increasing their risk of prematurity and facing neonatal or perinatal complications. Risk factors of pregnancies with PPROM include race (black patients are at increased risk), low socioeconomic status, history of sexually transmitted disease, distension of the uterus (which may result from factors such as excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) or carrying more than one fetus (multifetal pregnancy)), and tobacco smoking.
*AROM: artificial rupture of membranes. This term describes a rupture of the membranes by a third party, usually a midwife or obstetrician, in order to induce or accelerate labor. 

==Detection==
Detection of rupture of membranes mainly include:
*&quot;Pooling test&quot;: visualization of amniotic fluid pooling in the vagina
*Nitrazine paper test
*Fern test
*Amniotic fluid index
For results to be roughly 90% accurate in infection detection, a combination of both an arborization test and nitrazine paper test may be used. An arborization test assesses the patient&#x27;s vaginal secretions, while a nitrazone paper test uses the nitrazine paper to examines vaginal pH.

<doc id="1166243" wikidata="Q5628110" url="?curid=1166243" title="H. C. Coombs">
<text>Herbert Cole &quot;Nugget&quot; Coombs (24 February 1906 – 29 October 1997) was an Australian economist and public servant. He was the first Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, in which capacity he served from 1960 to 1968.

==Early years==
Coombs was born in Kalamunda, Western Australia, one of six children of a country railway stationmaster and a well-read mother.

Coombs&#x27;s political and economic views were formed by the Great Depression, which hit Australia in 1929 and caused a complete economic collapse in a country totally dependent on commodity exports for its prosperity. As a student in Perth, he was a socialist, but while he was studying at the London School of Economics, he became converted to the economic views of John Maynard Keynes. He spent the rest of his career pursuing Keynesian solutions to Australia&#x27;s economic problems. He never sought public office nor joined a political party, but he sought to exercise political influence as an administrator and advisor.

He won a scholarship to Perth Modern School. After five years there, he worked as a pupil-teacher for a year before spending two years at the Teachers&#x27; College. He then spent two years teaching at country schools, during which he studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree in the University of Western Australia (UWA), then the only free university in Australia. Transferring to a metropolitan school for the final two years, he graduated B.A. with first-class honours in economics and won a Hackett Studentship for overseas study. That was deferred for a year, enabling him to graduate M.A., also from UWA, and to marry fellow teacher Mary Alice (&#x27;Lallie&#x27;) Ross at the end of 1931. As a student at UWA, Coombs was elected as the 1930 Sports Council president and subsequently the 1931 president of the Guild of Undergraduates. He then proceeded to the London School of Economics, where he studied under Harold Laski, one of the most influential Marxists of the 20th century. In 1933, he was awarded a PhD for a thesis on central banking.

In 1934, he returned to a teaching position in Perth and combined it with part-time lecturing in economics at UWA.

==Public service==
In 1934, Coombs returned to Australia, and in 1935, he became an economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, then a state-owned bank that served as Australia&#x27;s central bank. In 1939, he shifted to the Department of the Treasury in Canberra as a senior economist. He became known as a Keynesian rebel against the classical economics theory that had dominated the Treasury, under the influence of the Melbourne University school of economists, led by L. F. Giblin and Douglas Copland.

The Australian Labor Party under John Curtin came to power in 1941, and Coombs found himself in a political environment much more supportive of his views. Curtin appointed him to the Commonwealth Bank board in October 1941. In 1942, the Treasurer, Ben Chifley, appointed him Director of Rationing, and in 1943 made him Director-General of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, a new ministry that Chifley held in addition to the Treasury. Coombs played a leading role in the preparation of the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia which, for the first time, committed the government to maintaining full employment from the post-WWII years.

Chifley, a former train driver, had no training in economics and came to rely heavily on Coombs&#x27;s advice. Coombs&#x27;s closeness to Chifley and the greatly expanded role of government in the economy during World War II made him one of the most powerful public servants in Australian history. His influence further expanded when Chifley became prime minister in 1945.

In January 1949, Chifley appointed Coombs as governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the most important post in the regulation of the Australian economy. When the Liberal Party came to power in December of that year, however, Coombs&#x27;s demise seemed likely, but the new prime minister, Robert Menzies, kept him on and soon came to trust his judgement. Menzies was a moderate Keynesian, and there were few policy differences between the two men, especially since Australia soon embarked on a long postwar boom, and hardly any tough economic decisions needed to be made.

In 1960, when the Reserve Bank of Australia was created to take over the Commonwealth Bank&#x27;s central banking functions, Coombs was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank. At the time, he paid tribute to Sir Leslie Melville by advising the government and others that the best man for the job had been overlooked.

He retired as a public servant in 1968.

==Later life==

Coombs continued to work following his retirement. He had already signalled his interest in the arts by becoming the first chairman of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1954 (named in honour of Elizabeth II, not because it promoted Elizabethan theatre). In 1967, he persuaded Prime Minister Harold Holt to create the Australian Council for the Arts (the non-statutory predecessor to the Australia Council) as a body for the public funding of the arts, and in 1968, he became its chairman. He worked closely with Prime Minister John Gorton to secure funding for an Australian film industry. He also became chancellor of the Australian National University (1968–1976), which he had helped found in 1946. He delivered the 1970 Buntine Oration, titled &quot;Human Values – Education in the Changing Australian Society.&quot;

Coombs&#x27;s most important post-retirement role was as a supporter of the Australian Aboriginal people. In 1967, he became chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, set up by the Holt government in the wake of the referendum that gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate specifically for the Aboriginal people. He was, however, disappointed that the Gorton and McMahon governments took up few of the Council&#x27;s recommendations.

He became a close advisor to the Labor leader Gough Whitlam in the years before Whitlam became prime minister in 1972, and he largely wrote Labor&#x27;s policy on Aboriginal affairs, particularly the commitment to Aboriginal land rights. In December 1972, as chair of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, Coombs received a delegation from the Aboriginal Housing Committee, based in Redfern, Sydney, applying for a grant to improve housing for Aboriginal people in the area. Their application for a grant was successful, enabling the AHC to commence purchasing houses which led to the creation of the Aboriginal-run housing project, The Block.

In 1972, he was &quot;The Australian&quot;&#x27;s inaugural Australian of the Year, an award created in competition to the more widely recognised Victorian Australia Day Council&#x27;s Australian of the Year.

From 1972 to 1975, Coombs served as a consultant to Prime Minister Whitlam, but his influence was resented by other ministers. He found the experience of the first Labor government since 1949 disappointing. He disapproved of the events that led up to the Loans Affair of 1975 and the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which led to the dismissal of Whitlam&#x27;s government by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. He advised Whitlam not to resort to unorthodox means of financing government operations when the Senate blocked supply, but Whitlam did so anyway. Although he regarded the dismissal as scandalous, his estrangement from Whitlam meant that he took little subsequent part in politics.

In 1974 Whitlam announced the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, chaired by Coombs, which was tasked with examining the purpose, functions, organisation and management of Australian Government bodies and the structure and management of the Australian Public Service. The commission reported in 1976 recommending greater autonomy for public servants&#x27; decisions. this included employment and finance decisions that had been controlled by central departments such as the Public Service Board. Public servants would also be subject to performance reviews. The Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser largely ignored the recommendations, focusing on reducing the size of the Public Service and introducing accountability mechanisms.

In 1976, Coombs resigned all his posts and became a visiting fellow at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University, where he developed a new interest in environmental issues. However, Aboriginal affairs remained his greatest passion and, in 1979, he launched the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, calling for a formal treaty between Australia and the Aboriginal people. The idea gained much public support but neither the Fraser government nor its successor, Bob Hawke&#x27;s Labor government, took it up. From 1977 to 1979, Coombs was the president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

Coombs deplored the breakdown of the postwar Keynesian economic consensus represented by Thatcherism, and in his 1990 book &quot;The Return of Scarcity&quot; he proposed a Common Wealth Estate to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth. He suffered a disabling stroke in late-1995 and died in Sydney in 1997.

During the Howard government administration, the &quot;Coombs legacy&quot; in Aboriginal affairs came under increasing criticism from conservative thinkers. Journalist Piers Akerman argued that Coombs&#x27;s policy amounted to &quot;politically correct apartheid&quot;, and that the communal land ownership implicit in Aboriginal land rights was keeping Aboriginal people poor and dependent on welfare by preventing the private ownership of land. By contrast, many Aboriginal people retained strong support for Coombs&#x27; advocacy, and viewed his work as a precursor of the growth in the Aboriginal rights movement in the 21st century, as was noted by Philip Lowe, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, on a trip to Yirrkala in 2019.

==Relationship with Judith Wright==
In a June 2009 article in &quot;The Monthly&quot;, journalist Fiona Capp revealed the story of the 25-year secret love affair between two of Australia&#x27;s most well-known and well-loved public figures, &quot;the famous poet-cum-activist&quot; Judith Wright and &quot;the distinguished yet down-to-earth statesman&quot; &#x27;Nugget&#x27; Coombs.

==Recognition==
Coombs was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the first awards of the Order on the Queen&#x27;s Birthday in 1975. However, he resigned from the Order in 1976 upon the introduction of the grade of knighthood to the Order.

In January 2008, it was announced that a new suburb in the Canberra district of Molonglo would be named Coombs.

<doc id="1166244" wikidata="Q368184" url="?curid=1166244" title="Kenny Marchant">
<text>Kenny Ewell Marchant (born February 23, 1951) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for , from 2005 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he represented several areas around Dallas and Fort Worth.

On August 5, 2019, Marchant announced that he would not seek re-election to Congress in 2020. He was succeeded by fellow Republican Beth Van Duyne.

==Early life, education and career==
Marchant was born in Bonham, Texas, but grew up in Carrollton, a Dallas suburb. He graduated from R.L. Turner High School in Carrollton and attended college at Southern Nazarene University (SNU) in Bethany, Oklahoma, at which he graduated with a Business Administration degree. He worked as a real estate developer and he owned a homebuilding company prior to entering politics.

Marchant served on the Carrollton City Council from 1980 to 1984, and was mayor of Carrollton from 1984 to 1986, both nonpartisan positions.

==Texas House of Representatives==
He was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 2004. During three of his nine terms in the Texas House, Marchant served as chairman of the Committee on Financial Institutions. He pushed for legislation that reorganized the Texas Banking Code. In 2002, he was chosen as Chairman of the Texas House Republican Caucus. In 2004, he was named a Top Ten Legislator by &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; and Legislator of the Year by the Texas Municipal League.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Oversight
** Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures
* Committee on Ethics (Ranking Member)

Marchant was also a member of the Republican Study Committee, the Tea Party Caucus and the U.S.-Japan Caucus.

In the 110th Congress, Marchant served on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, Committee on Education and Labor, and Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

==Political positions==
Marchant worked closely with Bush when he was governor of Texas, and bills himself as a staunch conservative. However, he has occasionally broken ranks with the GOP, as he did to increase the minimum wage. He has said that his top priority on Capitol Hill will be cutting the federal deficit with fiscal conservative policies. In 2017, he voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Marchant expressed opposition to the proposed &quot;Green New Deal&quot; resolution in 2019, alleging that it would cost up to $93 trillion without having any effect on the global climate.

Marchant cosponsored legislation H.R. 1503 to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require candidates for the presidency &quot;to include with the campaign committee&#x27;s statement of organization a copy of the candidate&#x27;s birth certificate&quot; plus supporting documentation. Introduced without the Republican leadership being informed, &quot;Florida Today&quot; commented that the bill &quot;stems from fringe opponents of President Barack Obama who, during the 2008 election campaign, questioned whether Obama was born in Hawaii.&quot;

On December 18, 2019, Marchant voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles.

===&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;===
In December 2020, Marchant was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state.

==Political campaigns==
During the 2003 Texas redistricting, the 24th District, represented by 13-term Democrat Martin Frost, was reconfigured to be significantly more Republican. The old 24th had covered mostly Democratic areas around Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington. However, the reconfigured district shed its portions of Arlington and Fort Worth, replacing them with more suburban and Republican territory around Dallas. Had the district existed in 2000, George W. Bush would have won it with 68 percent of the vote.

Marchant ran for the redrawn district and was elected to Congress in 2004. He was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast). In 2014 he joined the newly founded Friends of Wales Caucus.

Marchant won his seventh term in the House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 154,845 votes (56.2 percent), he defeated Democrat Jan McDowell, who received 108,389 (39.3 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 4.5 percent of the ballots cast.

Marchant narrowly won his eighth term in the House in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 133,317 votes, 50.6%, with Democrat Jan McDowell receiving 125,231 votes, 47.5%. The margin of victory of 3.1% over his Democratic opponent was a marked reduction from the same campaign between the two in 2016, with a difference of 16.9% then. Libertarian Mike Kolls received 4,870 votes, 1.8%.

==Personal life==
Marchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children and seven grandchildren. They live in Coppell, a Dallas suburb. Marchant&#x27;s son Matthew Marchant is a former mayor of Carrollton, Texas.

<doc id="1166245" wikidata="Q7245154" url="?curid=1166245" title="Principle of distributivity">
<text>The principle of distributivity states that the algebraic distributive law is valid, where both logical conjunction and logical disjunction are distributive over each other so that for any propositions &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; the equivalences
:formula_1
and
:formula_2
hold.

The principle of distributivity is valid in classical logic, but both valid and invalid in quantum logic.

The article &quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot; discusses the case that quantum logic is the correct, empirical logic, on the grounds that the principle of distributivity is inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of quantum phenomena.

<text> (Icelandic: ; English: &quot;The National and University Library of Iceland&quot;) is the national library of Iceland which also functions as the university library of the University of Iceland. The library was established on 1 December 1994 in Reykjavík, Iceland, with the merger of the former national library, Landsbókasafn Íslands (est. 1818), and the university library (formally est. 1940). It is the largest library in Iceland with about one million items in various collections. The library&#x27;s largest collection is the national collection containing almost all written works published in Iceland and items related to Iceland published elsewhere. The library is the main legal deposit library in Iceland. The library also has a large manuscript collection with mostly early modern and modern manuscripts, and a collection of published Icelandic music and other audio (legal deposit since 1977). The library houses the largest academic collection in Iceland, most of which can be borrowed for off-site use by holders of library cards. University students get library cards for free, but anyone can acquire a card for a small fee. The library is open for public access.

The library main building is called Þjóðarbókhlaðan . It is a prominent red and white building near the main campus of the University of Iceland and the National Museum of Iceland. The building took 16 years to complete, finally opening in 1994, the year of the Icelandic republic&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

==History==
The first national library of Iceland, &quot;Íslands stiftisbókasafn&quot;, was established at the instigation of Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn and the Icelandic Literary Society in 1818, and the first books of the library were gifts from Icelanders and Danes. From 1825, the library was housed in the loft of the newly renovated Reykjavík Cathedral. In 1848, the first national librarian, folklorist Jón Árnason, was hired to manage it. In 1847, the manuscript collection was started with the purchase of a large collection of manuscripts from the estate of bishop Steingrímur Jónsson. On the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland in 1874 the library received many gifts. In 1883, Jón Árnason estimated the total number of volumes in the library at 20,000.

In 1881, the library moved into the new house of parliament, Alþingishús, and in 1886, the first Icelandic print law establishing the library as a legal deposit library was passed by the Alþingi. After this, the library grew fast and on its 100th anniversary in 1918, it counted 100,000 volumes. In 1906–1908, a special building, &quot;Safnahúsið&quot;, was erected to house the National Library, the National Museum, the Icelandic National Archives, and the Icelandic Natural History Museum.

The library of the University of Iceland was formally established in 1940 when the university moved into the Main Building. Before that time the individual departments had their own libraries. At the time it was debated whether it was practical to develop two academic state libraries in Iceland. In 1947, a committee was established to decide on a division of tasks between them. Soon, a merger of the two libraries was proposed. In 1956 and 1966, two committees were set up to prepare for this eventuality. It seemed clear that a new specially designed building close to the university would be required. The idea was that this new library building, &quot;Þjóðarbókhlaðan&quot;, would be opened in 1974 on the 1100th anniversary of the settlement of Iceland. The two libraries began working towards this end and UNESCO library experts were consulted as to the requirements of the new building.

As the year 1974 drew near it became increasingly clear, however, that the Icelandic state would not be able to construct the building in time. The 1973 Oil Crisis, among other things, resulted in a worsening of the state&#x27;s finances meaning that most of the ideas for the anniversary year had to be significantly reduced or scrapped. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new library was planned, instead of an inauguration, but even this was postponed until 1978 when construction finally began. Initially the building project proceeded and in 1983 the building was complete on the outside. However, significant funds were needed to complete the interior and for the next ten years the large building stood empty. Attempts were made to finance its completion with a special supplement on property tax, but most of that income was used for other expenses. Finally in 1991, the new government of Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn and Alþýðuflokkurinn made it a priority to complete the building, and on 1 December 1994 it opened.

While a lot of debate surrounded the building of &quot;Þjóðarbókhlaðan&quot; at the time, it resulted in vastly improved consultation, study and research facilities for researchers, university students and the general public in Iceland. The combination of the two libraries in one building resulted in an accessible library where users have direct access to the academic collection and reference works on the shelves while the national and manuscript collections are available for on-site consultation in a separate reading hall.

From 1888 to 1979, the National Library published a list of new books acquired each year. In 1979, this was replaced by the Icelandic National Bibliography, containing an overview of Icelandic published books each year. In October 1991, the two libraries implemented a joint online public access catalog system, Gegnir, gradually replacing the card catalogs. Since 2001, this system has been implemented nationwide for all public libraries in Iceland and is managed by a consortium. As of 2008, Gegnir can also be consulted via the European Library.

Since 1996 the library has engaged in several large digitisation projects providing open access to antique maps of Iceland (1998): Timarit.is – journals and newspapers (2002 in collaboration with the National Library of the Faroe Islands and the National Library of Greenland) –, Handrit.is – a catalog and digital library of manuscripts (in collaboration with the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies and the Arnamagnæan Institute) –, and the online Icelandic National Bibliography (2008) among others.

The library signed the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities in September 2012.

==Administration and roles==
The roles of the National and University Library are defined with a special law dating from 2011 and related regulations. The library is defined as an independent higher education institution under the Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture which commissions the library board, consisting of seven members, and the National Librarian.

Administratively the library is divided into five sections; conservation, services, communication, acquisitions and administration. The section heads form the library executive board, along with the National Librarian.

The library has the duty to collect and catalog all published Icelandic print, electronic and audio material for preservation and continued access. It is to manage its extensive manuscript collection and ensure the continued conservation of all the materials it collects. The library collects materials partly through receiving the legal deposit from publishers and partly through acquisitions and gifts.

The legal deposit is defined in a special law dating from 2001 where the collection of electronic material published on the World Wide Web is defined as being one of the tasks of the library. Currently, the library collects snapshots of all web pages within the Icelandic top-level domain .is using the Heritrix web crawler.

The library is the ISBN and ISSN national center in Iceland. It is also the national center for interlibrary loans. It has the role of coordinator for the national OPAC, Gegnir.

The library has the duty to provide information and library service to the general public. It has a special duty to support the needs of teaching and research at the University of Iceland. The library manages subscriptions to scientific databases and electronic journals for the university and administers the office for national access to bibliographic databases and electronic journals, hvar.is, jointly financed by the Icelandic state and a consortium of Icelandic libraries, schools and research institutions and companies.

==Collections==

===Reference section===
The reference section of the library contains reference works, manuals, encyclopedias, dictionaries and bibliographic registries etc. for on-site consultation. Within the reference section there are also computers for consulting the OPAC and for general use by guests. As these are part of the Internet of the University of Iceland, they have access to all electronic reference works that the university subscribes to in addition to the library subscriptions. The same applies to the wireless Internet hotspot available in the whole building. Part of the collection of reference works is available in the reading hall of the national and manuscript collections.

===National collection===
The national collection comprises all Icelandic published material in print, electronic or audiographic form collected through the legal deposit or acquired by other means. The library actively collects materials relating to Iceland published elsewhere and not subject to the Icelandic law on legal deposit. This equally applies to materials published online. This way, the library has created the most complete collection of Icelandic materials available anywhere in the world which it conserves, stores and makes available for on-site use in a special reading hall it shares with the manuscript collections. Access to highly valuable and rare items is restricted, but the library usually tries to make these available through its digital imaging production line. Within the national collection there are some private collections of individuals that are stored separately.

===Manuscript collections===
The library manuscript collections contain some 15,000 items, the oldest vellum manuscripts dating from around 1100 and are among the earliest examples of written Icelandic. Most of the collections are paper manuscripts, the oldest ones dating from the end of the 16th century. The youngest items are collections of manuscripts and letters, including electronic materials, from contemporary people which include some of Iceland&#x27;s most prominent literary figures such as Halldór Laxness. The manuscript collections of the library can be consulted in a separate reading hall where the items are provided by request for on-site use. Some of the manuscripts are cataloged in registers which are available in digital form on the library website. The library is currently working on creating an online catalog for manuscripts jointly with the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík and the Arnamagnæan Institute in Copenhagen.

===Audiovisual collection===
The audiovisual collection of the library is available for on-site use using special facilities, screens and headphones, provided by the library. The collection includes materials that are part of the national collection as well as a large collection of international materials, records, films, television programs etc. The main emphasis of the collection, however, is to collect all Icelandic material and make it available to library guests.

===Academic collection===
The bulk of the academic collection consists of materials from the original library of the University of Iceland. It contains international scientific works and textbooks along with literary works in many languages, including a large collection of translations of Icelandic literature. By request, the library reserves textbooks used in courses taught at the University of Iceland to ensure that they are available for on-site study. Most of the academic collection, however, can be borrowed for off-site use by holders of library cards issued by the library. Students at the University of Iceland get such cards for free. Parts of the collection are available in two library branches on campus.

<doc id="1166251" wikidata="Q292952" url="?curid=1166251" title="Gretl">
<text>gretl is an open-source statistical package, mainly for econometrics. The name is an acronym for &quot;G&quot;nu &quot;R&quot;egression, &quot;E&quot;conometrics and &quot;T&quot;ime-series &quot;L&quot;ibrary.

It has both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface. It is written in C, uses GTK+ as widget toolkit for creating its GUI, and calls gnuplot for generating graphs. The native scripting language of gretl is known as hansl (see below); it can also be used together with TRAMO/SEATS, R, Stata, Python, Octave, Ox and Julia.

It includes natively all the basic statistical techniques employed in contemporary Econometrics and Time-Series Analysis. Additional estimators and tests are available via user-contributed &quot;function packages&quot;, which are written in hansl.
gretl can output models as LaTeX files.

Besides English, gretl is also available in Albanian, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (both varieties), Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Ukrainian.

Gretl has been reviewed several times in the &quot;Journal of Applied Econometrics&quot; and, more recently, in the &quot;Australian Economic Review&quot;.

A review also appeared in the &quot;Journal of Statistical Software&quot; in 2008. Since then, the journal has featured several articles in which gretl is used to implement various statistical techniques.

== Supported data formats ==
gretl offers its own fully documented, XML-based data format.

It can also import ASCII, CSV, databank, EViews, Excel, Gnumeric, GNU Octave, JMulTi, OpenDocument spreadsheets, PcGive, RATS 4, SAS xport, SPSS, and Stata files. Since version 2020c, the GeoJSON and Shapefile formats are also supported, for thematic map creation.

It can export to Stata, GNU Octave, R, CSV, JMulTi, and PcGive file formats.

== hansl ==
Gretl has its own scripting language, called &quot;hansl&quot; (which is a recursive acronym for Hansl&#x27;s A Neat Scripting Language).

Hansl is a Turing-complete, interpreted programming language, featuring loops, conditionals, user-defined functions and complex data structures. It can be considered a domain-specific language for econometrics. Like other scientifically oriented programming languages, such as MATLAB and Julia, matrices are supported natively as a primitive variable type.

A simple example of hansl:
Running the above code produces
== Random Number Generation ==
Random Number Generation (RNG) in &quot;gretl&quot; has been examined and tested in Yalta &amp; Schreiber (2012). The authors conclude &quot;Our results show that the RNG related procedures in &quot;gretl&quot; are implemented soundly and perform well in the three crush test suites of the TestU01&quot;.

== Gretl as a teaching tool ==

Due to its libre nature and the breadth of econometric techniques it contains, gretl is widely used for teaching econometrics, from the undergraduate level onwards. Datasets in gretl format are available for several popular textbooks.

The following is a list of textbooks that use gretl as their software of choice:

* Dougherty, Christopher &quot;Introduction to Econometrics&quot; (Oxford University Press)
* Kufel, Tadeusz &quot;Ekonometria&quot; (Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN); in Polish (Russian version also available)
* Kivedal, Bjørnar &quot;Applied Statistics and Econometrics &quot; (Springer)
* Bismans, Francis J. and Damette, Olivier &quot;Dynamic Econometrics. Models and Applications&quot; (Springer)

In addition, a free supplement to Hill, Griffiths and Lim &quot;Principles of Econometrics&quot; (Wiley) is available.

<text>Óscar Alexander Pareja Gómez (born 10 August 1968) is a Colombian professional football manager and former player. He is currently the head coach of Orlando City SC in Major League Soccer. Pareja is nicknamed &quot;El Generalito&quot;, the Little General, but is now called &quot;Papi&quot;.

==Playing career==

Pareja came up through the youth system of Independiente Medellin; however, he began his professional career in 1987, debuting for renowned club Independiente Medellín. In his debut, he assisted on the winning goal in a 1–0 victory. He played eight years with the club, from 1987 to 1995, helping them to be Categoría Primera A runners-up in 1993, and leading them to a respectable performance in the 1994 Copa Libertadores. In 1995, Deportivo Cali purchased Pareja from Independiente Medellín; he paid immediate dividends, helping Cali to a championship in the 1995–1996 season, their first in 22 years. He would stay with them four years.

Pareja then signed with Major League Soccer (MLS) of the United States. After joining MLS, Pareja was allocated to the New England Revolution on 26 May 1998, but was soon traded to the Dallas Burn for Mexican forward Damian Alvarez. Although Pareja played little for Dallas in 1998, he earned himself a place at the center of Dallas&#x27;s midfield for the 1999 season, playing 27 games and scoring four goals and six assists, while coordinating the Burn attack. He remained in this position for six more years, playing in 189 regular season games for Dallas, while scoring 13 goals and 52 assists, and was named to the MLS Best XI in 2002. He announced he would retire following the 2005 MLS season and remained with the club, now renamed as FC Dallas, as an assistant coach.

===International===
Pareja also played for the Colombia national football team. In 11 caps, he scored three goals and played in the 1991 Copa América.

==Coaching career==
Pareja spent two seasons as an assistant coach with FC Dallas in 2006 and 2007. He then left the club to join the United States men&#x27;s national under-17 soccer team as an assistant coach at the IMG Soccer Academy in 2007–08. He then returned to the coaching staff at FC Dallas as a director and coach in their youth system. He was praised for the system&#x27;s achievements and was named the U-18 Academy Coach of the Year for the 2010–11 season. For the 2011 MLS season, Pareja returned to the first team as an assistant coach. He was also head coach for the reserve team.

The Colorado Rapids signed Pareja to his first head coach job on 5 January 2012. After finishing 7th in his debut season, Pareja led the Rapids to the playoffs in 2013. After two seasons he stepped down as Colorado head coach on 4 January 2014.

Pareja was announced as the head coach of his former club, FC Dallas, on 10 January 2014, after Dallas traded a first-round 2015 MLS SuperDraft pick and allocation money to Colorado. Having missed the playoffs the last two seasons prior to Pareja&#x27;s arrival, FC Dallas made the postseason in his debut season as head coach. In 2015, Dallas topped the Western Conference regular season table, finishing runners-up for the Supporters&#x27; Shield to New York Red Bulls. The following year the club did a domestic double winning both the Supporters Shield and the U.S. Open Cup, defeating New England Revolution 4–2 in the final. It was the club&#x27;s first Supporters&#x27; Shield win and second time lifting the U.S. Open Cup having last done so in 1997.

Amid speculation about interest from Liga MX, Pareja stepped down as manager of Dallas following the completion of the 2018 season. He had a combined 18 years at the club as a player, coach, and manager. Club Tijuana announced Pareja as their new manager on 27 November 2018. After 12 months, Pareja leaves Tijuana under mutual agreement 

On 4 December 2019, Pareja returned to MLS, becoming the fourth permanent head coach of Orlando City SC. With the season affected by the COVID-19 pandemic two rounds into the season, Pareja guided Orlando to the MLS is Back Tournament final on the resumption of play, the team&#x27;s first final in their MLS era. Orlando finished top of Group A taking 7 points from three matches and notably eliminated reigning Supporters&#x27; Shield winners Los Angeles FC in the quarter-final before eventually losing to Portland Timbers 2–1 in the final. In 2022, Pareja led Orlando City to its first title, winning the US Open Cup.

<doc id="1166255" wikidata="Q646915" url="?curid=1166255" title="N'guigmi">
<text>N&#x27;guigmi is a city and Commune of fifteen thousand in the easternmost part of Niger, very near to Lake Chad – lying on its shore until the lake retreated. It is a crossroads for the traditional camel caravans of the Toureg and for traders plying North and South across the Sahara.

== Overview ==
N&#x27;guigmi is a military centre for the region, a centre for the salt trade from Kaourar and is the last stop on the road to Chad. It is &quot;the end of the road&quot; and marks the end of the paved section of the Nigerien &quot;Route Nationale 1&quot;, although the sections past Diffa are notorious for their poor condition. Two unpaved highways or caravan routes connect to N&#x27;guigmi from the north, providing the main road route between Chad and Niger, and one of two land routes to the Kaourar Oasis town of Bilma.

The town lies at the mouth of the Dilia Bosso, an ancient river valley and seasonal wash that runs from the Termit Massif over 200 km to the northwest to what was the shore of Lake Chad as recently as the mid 20th century. The town was then a centre of Kanuri fishing communities. By the 2000s, even during the rainy season, the nearest access to water was at the village of Doro (a Beri-beri name for &quot;Fishing port&quot;) 45 km southwest of N&#x27;guigmi. During the Sahel drought of the mid-1970s the shore was 85 km away from N&#x27;guigmi in Chad.

The town is the seat of the Department of N&#x27;guigmi, one of three in Diffa Region, which includes the entire north of the Region. N&#x27;guigmi is home to a large settlement of Kanuri people, as well as settled members of the traditionally pastoral Wodaabe-Fulani and Daza/Toubou ethnic groups.

<doc id="1166259" wikidata="Q1546953" url="?curid=1166259" title="Nova Scotia Voyageurs">
<text>The Nova Scotia Voyageurs were a professional ice hockey team, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. They played in the American Hockey League, from 1971 to 1984. Originally chartered as the Omaha Knights of the Central Professional Hockey League before becoming the Houston Apollos of the Central Hockey League, the organization was relocated to Montreal after five seasons due to low attendance and travel costs. The Voyageurs (or &quot;Vees&quot; for short) played their first two seasons (1969–71), as the Montreal Voyageurs and were the affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens.

In 1971, they relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were the first AHL team to be located in Atlantic Canada, and would be the first to play in the Halifax Metro Centre. The team was also the first Canadian club to win the Calder Cup, and were the class of the league for many years - only in two seasons did the team garner a losing record, and the Voyageurs never missed the playoffs. The team eventually moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec to become the Sherbrooke Canadiens.

The Vees won three Calder Cups, the first in 1972. Nova Scotia won again in 1976 and 1977, while their parent Canadiens were winning back-to-back Stanley Cups; this is the only time an NHL/AHL affiliated combo have won both Cups in the same year twice.

The team was replaced in Halifax by the Nova Scotia Oilers, an affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers and subsequently the Halifax Citadels, an affiliate of the Quebec Nordiques.

With the success of the Voyageurs in its existence of 13 seasons, it spawned a period of 34 consecutive years where there would be at least one AHL team in Atlantic Canada. This was largely due to the desire of several Canadian NHL franchises to continue to pay players sent down to the minors in Canadian dollars throughout the 1980s and 1990s. However, by the late 1990s, many of the remaining AHL teams in Atlantic Canada had disappeared, either by relocation or by the franchise being rendered dormant. The last remaining team in this long period would be the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, which moved from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in 2005 to Toronto, Ontario to play as the Toronto Marlies. The AHL did not return to Atlantic Canada until 2011 with the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps.

<doc id="1166261" wikidata="Q5925486" url="?curid=1166261" title="Randy Kuhl">
<text>John Randolph Kuhl Jr. (born April 19, 1943) is an American Republican politician. He is a former member of the New York State Assembly, the New York State Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. Kuhl represented New York&#x27;s 29th congressional district for two terms before being defeated for reelection by Eric Massa in 2008.

== Early life and education ==
Kuhl was born in Hammondsport, New York. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York with a B.A. in civil engineering in 1966, and then got a J.D. degree from Syracuse University College of Law in 1969. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1970. He is an Episcopalian.

==New York State Legislature==
 Kuhl was a member of the New York Assembly from 1981 to 1986, sitting in the 184th, 185th and 186th New York State Legislatures. In November 1986, after the retirement of William T. Smith, Kuhl ran for Smith&#x27;s Senate seat and won.

Kuhl was a member of the New York State Senate from 1987 to 2004, sitting in the 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 192nd, 193rd, 194th, 195th and 196th New York State Legislatures. He was appointed the Senate&#x27;s Assistant Majority Leader for Operations at the beginning of the 1995 legislative session.

One of Kuhl&#x27;s signature issues in the state legislature was Upstate secession. He regularly introduced a bill &quot;to let New York City, Long Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties became a separate state called New York; the rest of the counties would become West New York. At least one poll in upstate has found the idea to be wildly popular.&quot; Kuhl summed up his secessionist views by saying that &quot;his constituents in the Finger Lakes region often wonder, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you just cut the City of New York off and let it drift out to sea?&#x27;&quot;

In 1997, while serving as a state senator, Kuhl was arrested and convicted of driving while intoxicated. His driver&#x27;s license was revoked for six months.

==House of Representatives==
=== 2004 election ===
In 2004, Kuhl ran for the House seat of retiring U.S. Representative Amo Houghton, a Republican multimillionaire who had displayed a moderate bent during 18 years in Washington. In the Republican primary, Kuhl, who was supported by Houghton, defeated Monroe County Legislator Mark Assini. He then defeated 27-year-old Democrat Samara Barend in the general election.

=== 2006 election ===

Kuhl&#x27;s Democratic opponent in the 2006 elections was former Navy officer Eric Massa of Corning, a former Republican.

In March 2006, Kuhl invited President George W. Bush to Canandaigua. In September 2006, Kuhl welcomed Vice President Dick Cheney to a major fundraiser in Rochester. Kuhl agreed with Cheney&#x27;s assessment that combating terrorists around the world was the top issue in the campaign. According to Kuhl, bad news from the war zone should be countered by a frank discussion of reality. Regarding his Finger Lakes and Southern Tier constituents, Kuhl said, &quot;They don&#x27;t necessarily understand the full importance of our presence there&quot;.

Preliminary results from the November election showed Kuhl narrowly beating Massa by a margin of approximately 5,600 votes (out of about 193,000 cast). Massa had initially refused to concede the election and was expected to file a challenge, but on November 15, 2006, Massa conceded the election and contacted Kuhl to congratulate him. According to the final election results, which were certified by the New York State Board of Elections on December 14, 2006, Kuhl won by a margin of 6,033 votes (out of 206,121 cast).

===2008 election===

Kuhl&#x27;s again faced Democratic nominee and former Navy officer Eric Massa, losing the rematch by a narrow 51%-49% margin, roughly reversing the outcome of the 2006 elections. Kuhl finished behind Massa in Cattaraugus County, a county Kuhl carried by a 56%-44% margin in 2006 (and one that voted for presidential candidate John McCain in 2008), likely contributing to the loss. Because the race was so close, Kuhl did not concede the election until November 21, 2008.

=== Political positions ===
Kuhl was considered a fairly reliable conservative who generally voted against abortion rights, gun control and tax increases. He was, however, a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.

Kuhl supported making then-President Bush&#x27;s tax cuts permanent. In addition, he also advocated for a 10-cent reduction in federal gasoline taxes.

In September 2007, Kuhl was noted in the news as being one of the most outspoken opponents of a plan by then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer to allow illegal aliens to apply for driver&#x27;s licenses. He also became a prominent opponent of the SCHIP expansion, a stance for which he earned significant animosity from various groups including MoveOn, the Service Employees International Union, and even former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer.

During his time as a state senator, Kuhl was an advocate of New York City secession and unsuccessfully introduced several bills to separate Upstate New York from downstate.

<doc id="1166271" wikidata="Q1677016" url="?curid=1166271" title="Jack Davis (cartoonist)">
<text>John Burton Davis Jr. (December 2, 1924 – July 27, 2016) was an American cartoonist and illustrator, known for his advertising art, magazine covers, film posters, record album art, and numerous comic book stories. He was one of the founding cartoonists for &quot;Mad&quot; in 1952. His cartoon characters are characterized by extremely exaggerated anatomy, including big heads, skinny legs, and large feet.

==Early life==
Davis was born December 2, 1924, in Atlanta, Georgia. As a child, he enjoyed listening to Bob Hope on the radio and tried to draw him, despite not knowing what Hope looked like.

==Career==

===Early work===
Davis saw comic book publication at the age of 12 when he contributed a cartoon to the reader&#x27;s page of &quot;Tip Top Comics&quot; No. 9 (December 1936). After drawing for his high school newspaper and yearbook, he spent three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he contributed to the daily &quot;Navy News.&quot;

Attending the University of Georgia on the G.I. Bill, he drew for the campus newspaper and helped launch an off-campus humor publication, &quot;Bullsheet&quot;, which he described as &quot;not political or anything but just something with risque jokes and cartoons.&quot; After graduation, he was a cartoonist intern at &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, and he worked one summer inking Ed Dodd&#x27;s &quot;Mark Trail&quot; comic strip, a strip which he later parodied in &quot;Mad&quot; as &quot;Mark Trade&quot;.

===Comic strips and comic books===
 In 1949, Davis illustrated a Coca-Cola training manual, a job that gave him enough money to buy a car and drive to New York. Attending the Art Students League of New York, he found work with the Herald Tribune Syndicate as an inker on Leslie Charteris&#x27;s &quot;The Saint&quot; comic strip, drawn by Mike Roy in 1949–1950. His own humor strip, &quot;Beauregard,&quot; with gags in a Civil War setting, was carried briefly by the McClure Syndicate. After rejections from several comic book publishers, he began freelancing for William Gaines&#x27;s EC Comics in 1950, contributing to &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;Frontline Combat&quot;, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, &quot;Piracy&quot;, &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Crime Suspenstories&quot;, &quot;Shock Suspenstories&quot;, and &quot;Terror Illustrated&quot;.

In 2011, Davis told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; about his early career and his breakthrough with EC:

Davis was particularly noted for his depiction of the Crypt-Keeper in the horror comics, revamping the character&#x27;s appearance from the more simplistic Al Feldstein version to a tougher, craggier, mangier man with hairy warts, salivating mouth and oversized hands and feet, who usually did not wear shoes. Among the classic horror tales he illustrated were &quot;Foul Play&quot;, which was cited in Dr. Fredric Wertham&#x27;s book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; for its depiction of &quot;a comic book baseball game&quot;. Others, like &quot;Tain&#x27;t the Meat, It&#x27;s the Humanity&quot;, &quot;Death of Some Salesman&quot;, &quot;Fare Tonight Followed by Increasing Clottiness&quot;, &quot;Tight Grip&quot; and &quot;Lower Berth&quot;, were Crypt-Keeper classics. He did the covers for every issue of &quot;Crypt&quot; from issue No. 29 to No. 46. In his work for Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s war comics, he tackled a variety of subjects and had a particular affinity for depicting American Civil War stories. He also did many covers for &quot;Frontline Combat&quot;, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; as well. The editors, William M. Gaines, Albert B. Feldstein and Harvey Kurtzman, have said he was the fastest artist they had in those days, completely penciling and inking three or more pages a day at times. His use of the brush to create depth and mood was unique and memorable. His wrinkled clothing, scratchy lines, and multi-layered layouts were so popular in the 1950s that other artists at rival companies began copying the style—notably, Howard Nostrand in Harvey&#x27;s horror comics. In the late 1950s, Davis drew Western stories for Atlas Comics. His 1963 work on the &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; (#33–35) was his last for non-humor comic books.

His style of wild, free-flowing brushwork and wacky characters made him a perfect choice when Harvey Kurtzman launched &quot;Mad&quot; as a zany, satirical EC comic book in 1952. He appeared in most of the first 30 issues of &quot;Mad&quot;, all 12 issues of &quot;Panic&quot; and even some work in &quot;Cracked&quot;. Davis contributed to other Kurtzman magazines—&quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;Humbug&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;—eventually expanding into illustrations for record jackets, movie posters, books and magazines, including &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot;. In 1959, he completed an 88-card set of humorous cartoons for Topps Chewing Gum Co. called Wacky Plaks, also a 66-card monster-themed set called &quot;You&#x27;ll Die Laughing&quot;, and a 66-card set of Funny Valentine cards. In 1960, Davis illustrated another 66-card set of Funny Valentine cards and in 1961, a set of Giant Funny Valentine cards. In 1964, he illustrated a set of Nutty Awards postcards, also released by Topps Chewing Gum Co., and in 1980 he helped illustrate a set of Topps Bazooka Wanted Posters. Davis illustrated two children&#x27;s picture books, &quot;Bobby and the Magic Pen&quot; and &quot;The Misadventures of Don Quixote&quot; (both still available online). He also has a first-published book of his sketches on Amazon, &quot;The Jack Davis Sketchbook of Untold Spooky Ghost Stories&quot;. Davis enjoyed his sketches more than his final artwork because he felt it represented his creative talents.

In 1961, Davis wrote, drew and edited his own comic book, &quot;Yak Yak&quot;, for Dell Comics. In 1965, he illustrated &quot;Meet The North American Indians&quot; by Elizabeth Payne, published by Random House as part of their children&#x27;s Step Up Books line. (). 

Davis&#x27; art appeared in 29 of the first 31 issues of &quot;Mad&quot;, totaling 66 articles, covers and house ads. But when editor Harvey Kurtzman quit the magazine following a dispute with publisher Bill Gaines, Davis chose to leave with him. He returned as a regular contributor to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine in 1965, starting with the cover for the paperback &quot;It&#x27;s a World, World, World, World MAD&quot;, in which he parodied his own poster art for the comedy film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. Davis would remain with &quot;Mad&quot; for more than 30 years until his retirement. His work appeared in 211 of the next 255 issues. He also drew 14 covers for the magazine.

Davis had a regular comic strip feature, &quot;Superfan&quot;, in &quot;Pro Quarterback&quot; magazine in the early 1970s. It was written by his &quot;Mad&quot; cohort, Nick Meglin.

===Advertising and magazines===
Davis first worked with &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1965, which hired him to illustrate an expansive eight-page advertising supplement for NBC&#x27;s TV lineup, which featured icons such as Johnny Carson, Dean Martin, and fictional characters such as Dr. Kildare, Napoleon Solo, and Maxwell Smart. His first cover for the magazine came in 1968, when he depicted a tribute to Andy Griffith, in which the actor was hoisted on the shoulders of his costars, Don Knotts and Jim Nabors. Davis recalls, &quot;Every assignment was a thrill because TV Guide was the top magazine in the country. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get in my little MG and drive from New York out to the magazine&#x27;s offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania, to show the editors my latest design. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world.&quot; Davis would contribute 23 covers for &quot;TV Guide&quot; between 1968 and 1981. In 2013 the magazine honored him in a retrospective in which it recounted his history with the publication and spotlighted some of his most memorable covers, including those depicting &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (March 28, 1970), Davis&#x27;s childhood hero Bob Hope for a cover on Hope&#x27;s history with the Oscars (April 10, 1971), and &quot;Bonanza&quot; (August 14, 1971). Years later, while watching a TV interview of Hope, Davis was gratified to notice that his Hope cover was displayed on the back wall of the comedian&#x27;s office; &quot;it was one of the proudest moments of my life,&quot; recalled Davis.

Davis created the cartoon bee which (in decal form) appears on the flanks of all the buses in the Bee-Line running from Westchester to New York City. A Westchester resident at the time, Davis lived directly adjacent to one of the Bee Line&#x27;s bus routes, and he mentioned in an interview how gratifying it was to see his own artwork drive past his window several times every day. Similar synchronicity happened when &quot;Mad&quot; moved to 1700 Broadway, where the magazine&#x27;s fifth-floor production department was next to a wall three feet away that had previously been the location of an immense Davis cartoon for a bank, an advertisement that towered six stories over 53rd Street.

===Films, posters, and cover art===
Like fellow &quot;Mad&quot; alumnus Paul Coker, Jr., Davis also contributed to Rankin-Bass productions; his character designs are featured in &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot;, &quot;The Coneheads&quot;, and the cartoon series &quot;The King Kong Show&quot;, &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot;, and &quot;The Osmonds&quot;. For Raid insecticide, Davis created the animated bug that screamed &quot;Raid?!&quot; Phil Kimmelman Associates created several commercials designed by Davis and animated in his style.

Davis produced the artwork for the poster for the 1963 comedy chase film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. In 2014, he remembered an experience from that year: &quot;My dad had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and he paid me a visit. He really had not been to New York in—well, ever—and he came out of the station and saw the signboard [advertising the film], very big signboard in Times Square. That was a big thrill. Little old me ...&quot;

Two years later, he parodied his own &quot;Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; image for the cover of the &quot;Mad&quot; paperback &quot;It&#x27;s a World, World, World, World Mad&quot;, his first work for the magazine following an almost seven-year hiatus. Having returned, Davis would remain a regular freelancer for more than thirty years. When the Criterion Collection released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in 2014, Davis provided new illustrations for the accompanying booklet.

Davis&#x27;s artwork for the comedy Western &quot;Viva Max!&quot; (1969) formed the centerpiece of that film&#x27;s promotional campaign, and he did the same for the film &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; in 1970. His poster for Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973) presented the film in a comic light.

In 1963 Davis produced a work of cover art for the Richard Wolfe album, &quot;Many Happy Returns of the Day!&quot; released by MGM Records, and designed the Homer and Jethro album, &quot;Homer and Jethro Go West&quot; (RCA Victor).

In 1964, Davis created the cover art for The New Christy Minstrels album for Columbia Records which featured songs from the light-hearted Western comedy &quot;Advance to the Rear&quot;.

In 1966, Davis created the cover art for the Johnny Cash album &quot;Everybody Loves a Nut&quot;. Davis also created album artwork for such musicians as The Guess Who, Tito Puente, Sailcat, and The Cowsills, as well as for such comedians as Bob and Ray, Archie Campbell, Don Imus, and Myron Cohen. He also provided the artwork for several of Sheb Wooley&#x27;s comic albums as his character Ben Colder. In 1974, Davis provided artwork for Atco Records&#x27; printed advertisements of the Genesis album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;.

During his tenure with &quot;Mad&quot;, Davis&#x27;s specialty was drawing sports-themed articles. This led to his work for Paramount Pictures, painting the poster for &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976).

=== Mascot ===
While Davis resided on St. Simons Island, Georgia, he sketched various characters and mascots for the College of Coastal Georgia in Brunswick, Georgia. His drawing of the Mariner, Capt. Jack, was ultimately selected by the college students and staff as the official school mascot.

==Personal life and death==
Davis grew up and went to college in Georgia. Following his professional career in New York, Davis and his wife Dena moved to St. Simons Island, Georgia, in the 1990s. They raised two children: daughter Katie Davis Lloyd and son Jack Davis III, who gave the cause of his father&#x27;s death on July 27, 2016, at age 91 as complications from a stroke.

==Awards and exhibitions==
Davis was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2003. He received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. A finalist for inclusion in the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, 1991, and 1992, he received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Advertising Award for 1980 and their Reuben Award for 2000. He was award the Inkpot Award in 1985.

In June 2002, Davis had a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Society of Illustrators in New York. He was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 2005.

In 1989, Davis was commissioned by the United States Postal Service to design the 25-cent Letter Carriers stamp. There was some concern that the cartoon would offend some letter carriers as being too informal and not respectful of their position. However, the president of the Letter Carriers Union gave his blessing, and the stamp was well received. Although postal policy does not allow artists to portray living persons on stamps, one of the carriers in the stamp is an unmistakable self-portrait of Davis.

In 2019, Davis was posthumously awarded the Inkwell Awards Stacey Aragon Special Recognition Award for his lifetime of work in the inking field.

<text>Álvaro de Luna y Fernández de Jarava (between 1388 and 13902 June 1453), was a Castilian statesman, favourite of John II of Castile. He served as Constable of Castile and as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. He earned great influence in the Crown&#x27;s affairs in the wake of his support to John II against the so-called Infantes of Aragon. Once he lost the protection of the monarch, he was executed in Valladolid in 1453.

==Early years==
He was born between 1388 and 1390 in Cañete, in what is now the province of Cuenca, as the illegitimate son of the Castilian noble don Álvaro Martínez de Luna, &quot;copero mayor&quot; (the page who poured drinks for a nobleman) of King Henry III of Castile, and María Fernández de Jarana, a woman of great character and beauty.

He was introduced to the court as a page by his uncle Pedro V de Luna, Archbishop of Toledo in 1410. Álvaro soon secured a commanding influence over John II, then a boy. During the regency of King John&#x27;s uncle Ferdinand, which ended in 1412, he was not allowed to be more than a servant. When, however, Ferdinand was elected king of Aragon, and the regency was assumed by the king&#x27;s mother, Catherine of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, and granddaughter of King Peter of Castile, Álvaro became a very important person, the so-called &quot;contino&quot;, or old friend of the King.

Álvaro de Luna married Elvira de Portocarrero in 1420. They had no issue. In 1430, he married , with whom he had two children.

== The King&#x27;s favourite ==
The young King regarded him with love and affection which the superstition of later time attributed to witchcraft. As the King was under pressure by greedy and unscrupulous nobles — among whom his cousins, the sons of Ferdinand, commonly known as the Infantes of Aragon, were perhaps the most dangerous — his reliance on a favourite who had every motive to be loyal to him, is quite understandable. Luna was also a master of all the accomplishments the King admired: a fine horseman, skillful with a lance and a writer of court verse. But beyond the purview of his peers, he was a master of intrigue and dissimulation.

Until he lost the King&#x27;s protection, Álvaro was the central figure of the Castilian history of the time. It was a period of constant conflict, characterised by shifting coalitions of nobles, namely the Infantes of Aragon Henry and John of Aragon, brothers of John II&#x27;s wife Maria, who, under the pretence of freeing the King from the undue influence of his favourite, were intent on making a puppet of him for their own ends.

The part which Álvaro de Luna played has been diversely judged. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition recounts that to Juan de Mariana he appears as a mere self-seeking favourite. To others, he has seemed to be a loyal servant of the King who endeavoured to enforce the authority of the crown, which in Castile was the only alternative to anarchy. He fought for his own ends, but his supremacy was perhaps better than the rule of lawless alliances of plundering nobles.

In 1427, he was solemnly expelled by a coalition of the nobles, only to be recalled in the following year. In 1431, he endeavoured to employ the restless nobles in a campaign for the reconquest of Granada, the remaining territory of Muslim Spain and then ruled by the sultan Muhammed IX. Some successes were gained at the Battle of La Higueruela, but in the end de Luna failed. A consistent policy was impossible with a rebellious aristocracy and a king of indolent character.

In 1445, the faction of nobles allied with Álvaro&#x27;s main enemies, the Infantes of Aragon, were defeated at the First Battle of Olmedo. One of them, Infante Henry, Duke of Villena, brother of the Queen, died of his wounds. Luna, who had been Constable of Castile and Count of San Esteban de Gormaz since 1423, became Grand Master of the Order of Santiago by election of the Knights.

== Downfall ==

Queen Maria died under suspicious circumstances, pointing to Luna as the mastermind. Nevertheless, his power appeared to be thoroughly established. It was, however, based only on the personal affection of the King. The King&#x27;s second wife, Isabella of Portugal, although her whole royal marriage was a product of Luna&#x27;s arrangements, was soon offended by the immense influence of the Constable, and when the murder of the King&#x27;s accountant Alfonso Pérez de Vivero was suspected to have been at Luna&#x27;s orders, she urged her husband to free himself from thralldom to his favourite. In 1453, the King succumbed to his wife&#x27;s demands; Luna was arrested, tried and condemned to death, and soon executed by beheading at Valladolid on 2 June 1453.

== Marriage and issue ==

By his marriage with Juana Pimentel, Álvaro de Luna had two children:
* ; married Leonor de Zuniga y Lara, daughter of the Duke of Béjar.
* , the heiress after her brother&#x27;s premature death. She married Íñigo López de Mendoza y Luna, 2nd Duke of the Infantado.

By Margarita Manuel, Álvaro de Luna had a natural son:
* . He was eventually legitimised.

<text>Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a term used for a group of pregnancy-related tumours. These tumours are rare, and they appear when cells in the womb start to proliferate uncontrollably. The cells that form gestational trophoblastic tumours are called trophoblasts and come from tissue that grows to form the placenta during pregnancy.

There are several different types of GTD. A hydatidiform mole also known as a &quot;molar pregnancy&quot;, is the most common and is usually benign. Sometimes it may develop into an invasive mole, or, more rarely into a choriocarcinoma. A choriocarcinoma is likely to spread quickly, but is very sensitive to chemotherapy, and has a very good prognosis. Trophoblasts are of particular interest to cell biologists because, like cancer, they can invade tissue (the uterus), but unlike cancer, they usually &quot;know&quot; when to stop.

GTD can simulate pregnancy, because the uterus may contain fetal tissue, albeit abnormal. This tissue may grow at the same rate as a normal pregnancy, and produces chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone which is measured to monitor fetal well-being.

While GTD overwhelmingly affects women of child-bearing age, it may rarely occur in postmenopausal women.

==Types==
GTD is the common name for five closely related tumours (one benign tumour, and four malignant tumours):
* The benign tumour
** Hydatidiform mole

Here, first a fertilised egg implants into the uterus, but some cells around the fetus (the chorionic villi) do not develop properly. The pregnancy is not viable, and the normal pregnancy process turns into a benign tumour. There are two subtypes of hydatidiform mole: complete hydatidiform mole, and partial hydatidiform mole.
* The four malignant tumours
** Invasive mole
** Choriocarcinoma
** Placental site trophoblastic tumour
** Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour

All five closely related tumours develop in the placenta. All five tumours arise from trophoblast cells that form the outer layer of the blastocyst in the early development of the fetus. In a normal pregnancy, trophoblasts aid the implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterine wall. But in GTD, they develop into tumour cells.

==Cause==
Two main risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of GTD: 1) The woman being under 20 years of age, or over 35 years of age, and 2) previous GTD.
Although molar pregnancies affect women of all ages, women under 16 and over 45 years of age have an increased risk of developing a molar pregnancy.

Hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions with excessive placental development. Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus.

Complete hydatidiform moles have no fetal tissue and no maternal DNA, as a result of a maternal ovum with no functional DNA. Most commonly, a single spermatozoon duplicates and fertilises an empty ovum. Less commonly, two separate spermatozoa fertilise an empty ovum (dispermic fertilisation).
Partial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells. They are triploid in origin, containing one set of maternal haploid genes and two sets of paternal haploid genes. They almost always occur following dispermic fertilisation of a normal ovum. Malignant forms of GTD are very rare. About 50% of malignant forms of GTD develop from a hydatidiform mole.

==Diagnosis==
Cases of GTD can be diagnosed through routine tests given during pregnancy, such as blood tests and ultrasound, or through tests done after miscarriage or abortion. Vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, pelvic pain or discomfort, and vomiting too much (hyperemesis) are the most common symptoms of GTD. But GTD also leads to elevated serum hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin hormone). Since pregnancy is by far the most common cause of elevated serum hCG, clinicians generally first suspect a pregnancy with a complication. However, in GTD, the beta subunit of hCG (beta hCG) is also always elevated. Therefore, if GTD is clinically suspected, serum beta hCG is also measured.

The initial clinical diagnosis of GTD should be confirmed histologically, which can be done after the evacuation of pregnancy (see Treatment below) in women with hydatidiform mole. However, malignant GTD is highly vascular. If malignant GTD is suspected clinically, biopsy is contraindicated, because biopsy may cause life-threatening haemorrhage.

Women with persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding after any pregnancy, and women developing acute respiratory or neurological symptoms after any pregnancy, should also undergo hCG testing, because these may be signs of a hitherto undiagnosed GTD.

There might be some signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism as well as an increase in the levels of thyroid hormones in some patients. The proposed mechanism is attaching hCG to TSH receptors and acting like TSH weakly.

===Differential diagnosis===
* These are not GTD, and they are not tumours
** Exaggerated placental site
** Placental site nodule

Both are composed of intermediate trophoblast, but their morphological features and clinical presentation can differ significantly.

Exaggerated placental site is a benign, non cancerous lesion with an increased number of implantation site intermediate trophoblastic cells that infiltrate the endometrium and the underlying myometrium. An exaggerated placental site may occur with normal pregnancy, or after an abortion. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.

Placental site nodules are lesions of chorionic type intermediate trophoblast, usually small. 40–50% of placental site nodules are found in the cervix. They almost always are incidental findings after a surgical procedure. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.

==Treatment==
Treatment is always necessary.

The treatment for hydatidiform mole consists of the evacuation of pregnancy. Evacuation will lead to the relief of symptoms, and also prevent later complications. Suction curettage is the preferred method of evacuation. Hysterectomy is an alternative if no further pregnancies are wished for by the female patient. Hydatidiform mole also has successfully been treated with systemic (intravenous) methotrexate.

The treatment for invasive mole or choriocarcinoma generally is the same. Both are usually treated with chemotherapy. Methotrexate and dactinomycin are among the chemotherapy drugs used in GTD. In women with low risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, a review has found that Actinomycin D is probably more effective as a treatment and more likely to achieve a cure in the first instance than methotrexate. Only a few women with GTD have poor prognosis metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. Their treatment usually includes chemotherapy. Radiotherapy can also be given to places where the cancer has spread, e.g. the brain.

Women who undergo chemotherapy are advised not to conceive for one year after completion of treatment. These women also are likely to have an earlier menopause. It has been estimated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that the age at menopause for women who receive single agent chemotherapy is advanced by one year, and by three years for women who receive multi agent chemotherapy.

===Follow up===
Follow up is necessary in all women with gestational trophoblastic disease, because of the possibility of persistent disease, or because of the risk of developing malignant uterine invasion or malignant metastatic disease even after treatment in some women with certain risk factors.

The use of a reliable contraception method is very important during the entire follow up period, as patients are strongly advised against pregnancy at that time. If a reliable contraception method is not used during the follow-up, it could be initially unclear to clinicians as to whether a rising hCG level is caused by the patient becoming pregnant again, or by the continued presence of GTD.

In women who have a malignant form of GTD, hCG concentrations stay the same (plateau) or they rise. Persistent elevation of serum hCG levels after a non molar pregnancy (i.e., normal pregnancy [term pregnancy], or preterm pregnancy, or ectopic pregnancy [pregnancy taking place in the wrong place, usually in the fallopian tube], or abortion) always indicate persistent GTD (very frequently due to choriocarcinoma or placental site trophoblastic tumour), but this is not common, because treatment mostly is successful.

In rare cases, a previous GTD may be reactivated after a subsequent pregnancy, even after several years. Therefore, the hCG tests should be performed also after any subsequent pregnancy in all women who had had a previous GTD (6 and 10 weeks after the end of any subsequent pregnancy).

==Prognosis==
Women with a hydatidiform mole have an excellent prognosis. Women with a malignant form of GTD usually have a very good prognosis.

Choriocarcinoma, for example, is an uncommon, yet almost always curable cancer. Although choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumour and a life-threatening disease, it is very sensitive to chemotherapy. Virtually all women with non-metastatic disease are cured and retain their fertility; the prognosis is also very good for those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, in the early stages, but fertility may be lost. Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) can also be offered to patients &gt; 40 years of age or those for whom sterilisation is not an obstacle. Only a few women with GTD have a poor prognosis, e.g. some forms of stage IV GTN. The FIGO staging system is used. The risk can be estimated by scoring systems such as the &quot;Modified WHO Prognostic Scoring System&quot;, wherein scores between 1 and 4 from various parameters are summed together:

In this scoring system, women with a score of 7 or greater are considered at high risk.

It is very important for malignant forms of GTD to be discovered in time. In Western countries, women with molar pregnancies are followed carefully; for instance, in the UK, all women who have had a molar pregnancy are registered at the National Trophoblastic Screening Centre. There are efforts in this direction in the developing countries too, and there have been improvements in these countries in the early detection of choriocarcinoma, thereby significantly reducing the mortality rate also in developing countries.

===Becoming pregnant again===
Most women with GTD can become pregnant again and can have children again. The risk of a further molar pregnancy is low. More than 98% of women who become pregnant following a molar pregnancy will not have a further hydatidiform mole or be at increased risk of complications.

In the past, it was seen as important not to get pregnant straight away after a GTD. Specialists recommended a waiting period of six months after the hCG levels become normal. Recently, this standpoint has been questioned. New medical data suggest that a significantly shorter waiting period after the hCG levels become normal is reasonable for approximately 97% of the patients with hydatidiform mole.

===Risk of a repeat GTD===
The risk of a repeat GTD is approximately 1 in 100, compared with approximately 1 in 1000 risk in the general population. Especially women whose hCG levels remain significantly elevated are at risk of developing a repeat GTD.

===Persistent trophoblastic disease===
The term «persistent trophoblastic disease» (PTD) is used when after treatment of a molar pregnancy, some molar tissue is left behind and again starts growing into a tumour. Although PTD can spread within the body like a malignant cancer, the overall cure rate is nearly 100%.

In the vast majority of patients, treatment of PTD consist of chemotherapy. Only about 10% of patients with PTD can be treated successfully with a second curettage.

===GTD coexisting with a normal fetus, also called &quot;twin pregnancy&quot;===
In some very rare cases, a GTD can coexist with a normal fetus. This is called a &quot;twin pregnancy&quot;. These cases should be managed only by experienced clinics, after extensive consultation with the patient. Because successful term delivery might be possible, the pregnancy should be allowed to proceed if the mother wishes, following appropriate counselling. The probability of achieving a healthy baby is approximately 40%, but there is a risk of complications, e.g. pulmonary embolism and pre-eclampsia. Compared with women who simply had a GTD in the past, there is no increased risk of developing persistent GTD after such a twin pregnancy.

In few cases, a GTD had coexisted with a normal pregnancy, but this was discovered only incidentally after a normal birth.

==Epidemiology==
Overall, GTD is a rare disease. Nevertheless, the incidence of GTD varies greatly between different parts of the world. The reported incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 23 to 1299 cases per 100,000 pregnancies. The incidence of the malignant forms of GTD is much lower, only about 10% of the incidence of hydatidiform mole. The reported incidence of GTD from Europe and North America is significantly lower than the reported incidence of GTD from Asia and South America. One proposed reason for this great geographical variation is differences in healthy diet in the different parts of the world (e.g., carotene deficiency).

However, the incidence of rare diseases (such as GTD) is difficult to measure, because epidemiologic data on rare diseases is limited. Not all cases will be reported, and some cases will not be recognised. In addition, in GTD, this is especially difficult, because one would need to know all gestational events in the total population. Yet, it seems very likely that the estimated number of births that occur at home or outside of a hospital has been inflated in some reports.

==Terminology==
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) may also be called gestational trophoblastic tumour (GTT). Hydatidiform mole (one type of GTD) may also be called molar pregnancy.

Persistent disease; persistent GTD: If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, usually defined as persistent elevation of beta hCG (see Diagnosis above), the condition may also be referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

<text>Barnafoss (), also known as Bjarnafoss , is a waterfall in Western Iceland on the river Hvítá in Borgarfjörður, about from Reykjavík. Located directly upstream from Hraunfossar, the two waterfalls flow out of the Hallmundarhraun lava field. 

==In mythology==
Many Icelandic folk tales have been associated with Barnafoss, the most famous being about two boys from a nearby farm, Hraunsás. One day, the boys&#x27; parents went with their ploughmen to a church. The boys were supposed to stay at home, but as they grew bored they decided to follow their parents. They made a shortcut and crossed a natural stone-bridge that was above the waterfall. But on their way, they felt dizzy and fell into the water and drowned. When their mother found out what had happened, she put a spell on the bridge saying that nobody would ever cross it without drowning himself. A little while later, the bridge was demolished in an earthquake.

Another waterfall, Barnafoss, is on the river Skjálfandafljót near the abandoned farm Barnafell in Ljósavatn County. There the river runs in a narrow, and close to deep canyon. According to legends, young and brave men jumped across its narrowest parts. During prolonged subzero periods, the spray creates an ice arch across the river above the waterfall and sometimes a rope was strung across the river there to quicken this development. Flocks of sheep were driven over that bridge to graze on Þingey, the island between the two branches of the river.

<text>Crowne Plaza by IHG is a multinational chain of full service, upscale hotels headquartered in the United Kingdom. It caters to the business, leisure and blended travel market usually located in city centers, resorts, coastal towns or near major airports. The brand is part of IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts family of brands, which include InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts and Holiday Inn Hotels &amp; Resorts, and operates in nearly 100 countries with more than 400 hotels and 110,000 bedrooms. 

==History==

Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza was established in 1983 as a breakout brand, the upscale sister brand to Holiday Inn. The first Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza hotel opened that year in Rockville, Maryland. In 1988, Bass PLC (today InterContinental Hotels Group) purchased Holiday Corporation and in 1994 the brand was renamed Crowne Plaza Hotels. In 1999, Crowne Plaza opened its first European property, in Madeira, Portugal.

==Notable properties==
*The Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, located within Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport, was voted the world&#x27;s best airport hotel for seven times (2020-2025, and 2022 to 2024) by Skytrax.
*The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent conversion to a hotel.
*The Crowne Plaza Copenhagen Towers is the first hotel in Denmark to generate all of its power from renewable sources, including solar panels and geothermal heating and cooling pumps. Its stationary bicycles are connected to generators, which provide electricity to the hotel.

<doc id="1166292" wikidata="Q4164507" url="?curid=1166292" title="Art critic">
<text>An art critic is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating art. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to art criticism and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures, and catalogues and on websites. Some of today&#x27;s art critics use art blogs and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate.

==Opinions==
Differently from art history, there is not commonly an institutionalized training for art critics. Art critics come from different backgrounds and they may or may not be university trained. Professional art critics are expected to have a keen eye for art and a thorough knowledge of art history. Typically the art critic views art at exhibitions, galleries, museums or artists&#x27; studios and they can be members of the International Association of Art Critics which has national sections. Very rarely art critics earn their living from writing criticism.

The opinions of art critics have the potential to stir debate on art-related topics. Due to this the viewpoints of art critics writing for art publications and newspapers adds to public discourse concerning art and culture. Art collectors and patrons often rely on the advice of such critics as a way to enhance their appreciation of the art they are viewing. Many now-famous and celebrated artists were not recognized by the art critics of their time, often because their art was in a style not yet understood or favored. Conversely, some critics have become particularly important helping to explain and promote new art movements – Roger Fry with the Post-Impressionist movement and Lawrence Alloway with pop art as examples.

== Controversies ==

According to James Elkins there is a distinction between art criticism and art history based on institutional, contextual, and commercial criteria; the history of art criticism is taught in universities, but the practice of art criticism is excluded institutionally from academia. An experience-related article is Agnieszka Gratza. Always according to James Elkins in smaller and developing countries, newspaper art criticism normally serves as art history. James Elkins&#x27;s perspective portraits his personal link to art history and art historians and in &quot;What happened to art criticism&quot; he furthermore highlights the gap between art historians and art critics by suggesting that the first rarely cite the second as a source and that the second miss an academic discipline to refer to.

<doc id="1166295" wikidata="Q5553676" url="?curid=1166295" title="Gestational choriocarcinoma">
<text>Gestational choriocarcinoma is a form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), that can occur during pregnancy. It is a rare disease where the trophoblast, a layer of cells surrounding the blastocyst, undergoes abnormal developments, leading to trophoblastic tumors. The choriocarcinoma can metastasize to other organs, including the lungs, kidney, and liver. The amount and degree of choriocarcinoma spread to other parts of the body can vary greatly from person to person.

Gestational choriocarcinoma can happen during and after any type of pregnancy event, though risk of the disease is higher in and after complete or partial molar pregnancies. Risk of disease may also be higher in those experiencing pregnancy at younger or older ages that average, such as below 15 years old or above 45 years old. Those with gestational choriocarcinoma may experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and have high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in addition to history of molar pregnancy or other metastatic cancer. A combination of history, symptoms, human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and imaging can be used in the diagnosis process, with ultrasonography being commonly used to image. Approximately 50% of those with gestational choriocarcinoma have experienced molar pregnancy, approximately 25% developed the disease after a regular, term pregnancy, and other situations have included history of ectopic pregnancy, where the pregnancy does not occur in the uterus.

Guidelines from the Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) exist to evaluate risk and treatment of the disease. There are generally three levels of risk: low risk, high risk, and ultrahigh risk. The primary form of treatment is chemotherapy with one or more agents. Duration can go upwards of six weeks following the return of human chorionic gonadotropin levels to the normal range. Depending on the risk of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) development, such as in certain people with mole pregnancies, chemotherapy has been used in a preventative manner in the past. However, this type of use is now advised against due to risk of toxicity and resistance to agents that may be needed in future treatment of the disease, on top of medical costs. Guidelines also detail options for salvage therapies in the situation of resistance to preferred choice of chemotherapy and surgical procedures possible in the situation of drug-resistant tumors.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of gestational choriocarcinoma. In the event the gestational choriocarcinoma has already spread to other parts of the body, bleeding events in other organs may be the first symptom. If the choriocarcinoma has metastasized to the lungs, one of the most common organs of metastasis, then symptoms may include abnormally quick breathing, coughing, and chest pain. However, it is also possible for there to be none of these symptoms and only a difference in biomarkers in an individual instead.

Uterine enlargement as seen in an ultrasound can be a presenting sign of gestational choriocarcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasounds may also be used in screening for the disease, with the positron emission tomography (PET) scan, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in locations such as the abdomen, pelvis, and brain being other imaging options. Chest x-rays may also be used to see if gestational choriocarcinoma has potentially spread to the lungs.

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the trophoblast and can be measured in both urine and blood. Another option of measuring this biomarker level is through lumbar puncture, which can show fluid-to-serum ratio of human chorionic gonadotropic and reflect whether the disease has potentially spread to the central nervous system. Elevated or rising human chorionic gonadotropin can be a sign of gestational choriocarcinoma, though it is also used as a biomarker in other types of gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD). It is useful not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and potential of recurring gestational choriocarcinoma.

== Causes ==
Gestational choriocarcinoma (GC) is the most aggressive form of trophoblastic tumor; it most commonly arises from certain fertilization defects, such as molar pregnancy, which results in increased level of growth factors and uncontrolled proliferation of trophoblasts in the uterus. Statistics from clinical cases have shown that GC is associated with any pregnancy events, with 50% of GC arise from hydatidiform moles, 25% from gestation, and 25% from abortion or tubal pregnancy. 

=== Risk factors ===
The precise underlying causes of this disease remain incompletely understood, primarily due to its rarity and clinical challenges in distinguishing it from invasive mole, another type of trophoblastic tumor that shares similarities with gestational choriocarcinoma (GC). Despite these complexities, several risk factors have been identified and reported to be associated with gestational choriocarcinoma. 

* Maternal age. This is one of the two well-established risk factors for GC. Many studies have shown that the risk of developing GC increased very rapidly in gestational women older than 40 years old.
* Prior history of complete hydatidiform mole. This is another well-established risk factor for GC. It has been showed that the risk of having GC after a complete hydatidiform mole is significantly higher than after a live birth.
* Others risk factors such as reproductive factors, use of oral contraceptives, diet and environmental factors were also reported. But because of data inconsistency, such associations are still questionable. For example, there is a case-control study showed that there&#x27;s a significant association of GC in women having more than 5 births. But other studies had showed no association when corrected for age. 

=== Pathogenesis ===
At the cellular level, any abnormalities in the placental trophoblastic proliferation could potentially contribute to molar pregnancy and tumor development. There are three different types of trophoblasts: cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and intermediate trophoblasts. Each of them possesses distinct specialized functions to support a developing embryo. Cytotrophoblasts are the germinating cells that forms the chorion villi and can be differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts which produce hCG and can intrude to the inner muscle layer of the uterus to help embed the developing embryo, and intermediate trophoblasts which spread throughout the chorion villi to support maternal-fetal circulation. Malignant cellular transformation of all of these three trophoblastic cells contribute to the development of gestational choriocarcinoma. Common pathological features of GC include abnormal trophoblastic enlargement, loss of trophoblastic specialized features and functions, absence of villi in the placenta, abnormal bleeding, and necrosis.

Many efforts have been made to try to understand the mechanism of how non-malignant mole could become invasive. It is suspected that activation of certain oncogenes (such as up-regulations of MDM2, c-ERB2, and BLC2) and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (such as up-regulations of p53, p21) were involved in the processes of genetic changes in this malignant transformation. But trophoblastic cells, by nature, are highly active in cell division, the increased activities of those genes are also necessary to maintain their normal cell function. Therefore, it is still unclear how significantly these genetic changes are in the pathogenesis of gestational choriocarcinoma.

Recent research in the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the GC development is believed to bring hope in this field. Long non-coding RNAs are groups of RNAs that do not code for protein expression and are usually over 200 nucleotides long; they are increasingly recognized to have essential role in many aspects of cellular function, like transcriptional regulation, sub-cellular protein localization, and epigenetic remodeling. To date, several types of lncRNAs are reported to have role in GC pathogenesis, which are metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), H19, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), the long intergenic non-coding RNA 00261 (LINC00261), etc. However, as many of these studies are still in the preliminary stages, more investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanism.

== Diagnosis ==
Common characteristic manifestations of gestational choriocarcinoma include irregular vaginal bleeding and hydatidiform moles. A hydatidiform mole is a red hemorrhagic mass with various sizes in the uterus. Often, diagnosis is presumptive. It is based on clinical findings and the identification of a malignant trophoblast. One prevalent symptom is vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy, abortion, or hydatidiform mole. In the presence of choriocarcinoma, a pregnancy test will be positive even if there is no embryo/fetus.

A confirmed diagnosis usually happens after the disease has progressed to a late clinical stage. This is partly due to the wide spectrum and rare clinical presentations of the disease. Individuals presented with the disease are mostly in their reproductive years.

Similar to other non-gestational tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma can be reflected via an elevated level in serum hCG concentration. Besides the change in serum hCG levels, the diagnosis of gestational choriocarcinoma also focuses on the presence of metastases after any types of pregnancy events. Based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)&#x27;s updated guidelines on gestational trophoblastic disease management, the diagnostic criteria of a post-gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is as follows:

# Over a period of 3 weeks or longer (day 1, 7, 14, 21), there are 4 or more plateaued hCG levels.
# Over a period of 2 weeks or longer (day 1, 7, 14), there are 3 consecutive weekly measurements of rising hCG levels.
# A histological diagnosis of choriocarcinoma.
There are currently different guidelines available in terms of diagnosing and recommending treatment options for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). The 4 guidelines identified are: the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RANZCOG). The differences in GTN diagnosis between the guidelines are as follows:

To differentiate gestational choriocarcinoma from other tumors such as lung or brain cancers, a genetic test is usually completed on top of a pathological diagnosis. DNA genotyping is a powerful tool that helps with the differentiation. The technique can accurately determine the time that it takes to develop the observed tumor and the type of index gestation, which includes term pregnancy, molar gestation, or non-molar abortion.

==Treatment==
Due to the susceptibility of choriocarcinomas to chemotherapy, it is the first line treatment for this disease. Treatment course depends on the FIGO Scoring System for GTN, which has various prognostic factors, and categorizes based on low risk with a score of 0-6 and high risk with a score of 7 and above. 

=== Low risk ===
Individuals with low risk GTN are usually treated with single agent chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and folinic acid (MTX/FA) or actinomycin D (ActD). Other treatment options for those with low risk include hysterectomy and surgical removal of the tumor if possible. 

=== High risk ===
Those with high risk GTN receive a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen, usually consisting of a weekly rotation of etoposide, methotrexate, and actinomycin D given one week and cyclophosphamide and vincristine given the following week, with variations to treatment occurring on a patient-specific basis.  In individuals who relapse, secondary chemotherapy is needed where treatment may vary from the original regimen. The treatment includes a platinum-etopside combination given with other chemotherapy medications, such as methotrexate and actinomycin D (EMA-EP), bleomycin (BEP), or ifosfamide (VIP, ICE). Additional treatment also consists of surgery and radiotherapy if deemed appropriate for the individual. This condition can also result in resistance to the medications used to treat it and failure of their success in the individuals. If this occurs, individuals usually undergo a more intensive medication regimen than what was originally given to them. 

=== Immune checkpoint inhibitors ===
New treatment options designed to reduce the risk of resistance are currently being researched, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Studies of gestational choriocarcinoma demonstrate an increased expression of the ligand PD-L1 and its corresponding receptor PD-1, leading to drug research and development into medications that can block the PD-1 receptor, such as Pembrolizumab. In individuals requiring more intensive chemotherapy options, using an immune checkpoint inhibitor may be preferable to long-term use of multi-agent chemotherapy to prevent prolonged toxicity to the body.
==Prognosis==
The survival rate following treatment with chemotherapy is approximately at least 90%. If gestational choriocarcinoma has spread to the liver in an individual, survival rate may be lower. Overall survival rate is also higher when management of gestational choriocarcinoma occurs in a setting with physicians familiar with the condition. Earlier diagnosis and treatment intervention can lead to greater success in preserving potential of future pregnancy in those seeking it.

Return of human chorionic gonadotropic levels to within the bounds of normal values lowers the chance of recurring gestational choriocarcinoma. These levels can be checked monthly as follow-up. For chemotherapy, patients should wait a minimum of one year following chemotherapy before they plan to have a child to minimize the chance of miscarriage.

<text>SmartLink was the trademark name for a proprietary technology by Sharp Corporation for wireless transmission of television signals. The system involved two devices, each a little bit bigger than a paperback book: one attached to a television screen and the other was hooked up to a TV tuner, DVD player, or any playback device. The video information was transmitted wirelessly using the 802.11b wireless standard, allowing the playback device to be up to away from the television screen.

The SmartLink system was to go on sale in Japan on August 3, 2001, at a list price of $400 ( present day US dollars).

SmartLink was incorporated into Sharp&#x27;s Wireless AQUOS television, model LC-15L1U-S.

Álvarez played 101 times for the Colombia national team between 1985 and 1997, making him the third most capped player in Colombian international football. He also served as head coach of the Colombia national team in 2011, and is the only coach to have been champion twice with Independiente Medellín.

==Club career==
Álvarez was born in Remedios, Colombia. He began his career with Independiente Medellín in 1983. In 1989, he was part of the Atlético Nacional team that won the Copa Libertadores in 1989. He won a Colombian league title with América de Cali in 1990 and another in 1992.

He has also played for Veracruz of Mexico and Real Valladolid of Spain.

Álvarez signed with Major League Soccer before the league&#x27;s inaugural 1996 season, and was allocated to the Dallas Burn on February 5, 1996.

In his year with the team, Álvarez he scored three goals and five assists for the team from a defensive midfield position, and was named as part of the MLS Best XI. Álvarez moved to Mexico for the 1997 season, where he played for Veracruz. He returned to Dallas Burn in 1998, where he recovered his starting position; Álvarez would be an extremely important player in the Burn&#x27;s central midfield for the next two years, but on August 13, 1999, he was traded to the New England Revolution for Ariel Graziani. He played his first match for the Revolution five days later, starting in a home loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. During the 2000 New England Revolution season, Álvarez scored his first goal for the Revolution, on April 1 against the LA Galaxy. He started all 3 matches of the Revolutions 2000 playoff campaign.

Álvarez played for the Revolution throughout 2001 before the team decided not to renew his contract for the 2002 season.

Late in his career, he returned to Colombian football, where he played for Deportes Quindío and for Deportivo Pereira.

==International career==
Álvarez appeared in a total of 101 games for the Colombia, making his debut on 14 February 1985 against Poland. He appeared for Colombia in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, playing in a total of seven games. Additionally, he played in the Copa América for his native country in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995.

==Coaching career==
Álvarez began his coaching career as technical assistant at Deportivo Pereira, one of his former clubs. In 2008, he worked as the assistant coach at Independiente Medellín, the team he began his career with, working as Santiago Escobar&#x27;s understudy. After Escobar was fired Álvarez was promoted and given his first head coach opportunity. In his debut season as a coach, he helped make Medellín champions. In May 2010 he was named the assistant coach of the Colombia national team. In September 2011, he was appointed head coach of the team, following the resignation of Hernán &quot;Bolillo&quot; Gómez. He got off to a good start by beating Bolivia, but was sacked on 14 December that year after the Colombian squad recorded a 1–1 draw with Venezuela and a 2–1 loss with Argentina in the World Cup qualifying campaign. In July 2012, he was appointed as Itagüí&#x27;s new coach.

<doc id="1166304" wikidata="Q522843" url="?curid=1166304" title="Joaquin Murrieta">
<text>Joaquin Murrieta Carrillo (sometimes misspelled Murieta or Murietta) (c. 1829 – July 25, 1853), also called the Robin Hood of the West or the Robin Hood of El Dorado, was a Mexican figure of disputed historicity. The novel &quot;The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta: The Celebrated California Bandit&quot; (1854) by John Rollin Ridge is ostensibly his story.

Legends subsequently arose about a notorious outlaw in California during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s, but evidence for a historical Murrieta is scarce. Contemporary documents record testimony in 1852 concerning a minor horse thief of that name. Newspapers reported a &quot; bandido&quot; named Joaquin, who robbed and killed several people during the same time. A California Ranger named Harry Love was assigned to track down Murrieta and was said to have brought his head in for the bounty.

The popular legend of Joaquin Murrieta was that he was a forty-niner, a gold miner and a &quot;vaquero&quot; (cowboy) from Sonora. Peace loving, he was driven to revenge after his brother and he were falsely accused of stealing a mule. His brother was hanged and Murrieta was horse-whipped. His young wife was raped, and in one version, she died in Murrieta&#x27;s arms. Swearing revenge, he hunted down the men who had violated her. He embarked on a short but violent career to kill his Anglo tormentors. The state of California offered a reward up to $5,000 for Murrieta, &quot;dead or alive.&quot;

==Controversy over his life==
Controversy surrounds the figure of Joaquin Murrieta—who he was, what he did, and many of his life&#x27;s events. Historian Susan Lee Johnson says:
&quot;So many tales have grown up around Murrieta that it is hard to disentangle the fabulous from the factual. There seems to be a consensus that Anglos drove him from a rich mining claim, and that, in rapid succession, his wife was raped, his half-brother lynched, and Murrieta himself horse-whipped. He may have worked as a monte dealer for a time; then, according to whichever version one accepts, he became either a horse trader and occasional horse thief, or a bandit.&quot;
John Rollin Ridge, grandson of Cherokee leader Major Ridge, wrote a dime novel about Murrieta. This fictional account contributed to his legend, especially as it was translated into various European languages. A portion of Ridge&#x27;s novel was reprinted in 1858 in the &quot;California Police Gazette&quot;. This story was picked up and subsequently translated into French. The French version was translated into Spanish by Roberto Hyenne, who took Ridge&#x27;s original story and changed every &quot;Mexican&quot; reference to &quot;Chilean&quot;.

Early 20th-century writer Johnston McCulley was said to have based his character Don Diego de la Vega—better known as Zorro in his 1919 novel of that name—on Ridge&#x27;s 1854 novel about Murrieta.

==Early life and education==
Most biographical sources hold that Murrieta was born in Hermosillo in the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico. Historian Frank Forrest Latta wrote &quot;Joaquín Murrieta and His Horse Gangs&quot; (1980) based on decades of investigation of the Murrieta family in Sonora, California, and Texas. He said that Murrieta was from the Pueblo de Murrieta on the Rancho Tapizuelas, across the Cuchujaqui River (known locally as the Arroyo de [los] Álamos). This was north of Casanate, in the southeast of Sonora and near the Sinaloa border, within what is now the Álamos Municipality, of Sonora. Murrieta was educated at a school nearby in El Salado.

==1849 migration to California==

Murrieta reportedly went to California in 1849 to seek his fortune in the California Gold Rush. His older Carrillo stepbrother Joaquin Manuel Carrillo Murrieta, who was already in California, had written him about the discovery of gold and urged him to come. Like many Sonorans, Murrieta and a party including his new wife Rosa Feliz, traveled there across the Altar and Colorado Deserts in 1849. This large family expedition included Joaquin&#x27;s younger brother (Jesus Murrieta); Jesus Carrillo Murrieta, his other Carrillo stepbrother; three Feliz brothers-in-law (Claudio, Reyes, and Jesus); two Murrieta cousins (Joaquin Juan and Martin Murrieta; four Valenzuela cousins (including Joaquin, Theodoro, and Jesus Valenzuela); two Duarte cousins (Antonio and Manuel); and a few other men from Pueblo de Murrieta or nearby.

== Five Joaquins Gang ==

Murrieta encountered prejudice and hostility in the extreme competition of the rough mining camps. While mining for gold, his wife and he were supposedly attacked by American miners jealous of his success. They allegedly beat him and raped his wife. However, the only source for this account was a dime novel, &quot;The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta&quot;, written by John Rollin Ridge and published in 1854.

Historian Latta wrote that Murrieta formed a gang, with well-organized bands, one led by himself and the rest led by one or two of his trusted Sonoran relatives. Latta documented that the core of these men had gathered to help Murrieta kill at least six of the Americans who had lynched his stepbrother Jesus Carrillo and whipped him on the false charge of the theft of a mule. The gang began to engage in illegal horse trade with Mexico, using stolen horses and legally captured mustangs. They drove herds of stolen horses from as far north as Contra Costa County, the gold camps of the Sierras, and the Central Valley via the remote La Vereda del Monte trail through the Diablo Range, then south to Sonora for sale.

At other times, the bands robbed and killed miners or American settlers, particularly those returning from the California goldfields. The gang is believed to have killed up to 28 Chinese and 13 Anglo-Americans. This figure is based on accounts of their raids in early 1853.

== The death of Joaquin Murrieta ==
By 1853, the California state legislature listed Murrieta as one of the so-called &quot;Five Joaquins&quot;, suspected criminals in a bill passed in May 1853. The legislature authorized hiring for three months a company of 20 California Rangers, veterans of the Mexican War, to hunt down &quot;the five Joaquins, whose names are Joaquin Muriati [sic], Joaquin Ocomorenia, Joaquin Valenzuela, Joaquin Botellier, and Joaquin Carillo, and their banded associates.&quot; On May 11, 1853, the governor, John Bigler, signed an act to create the &quot;California State Rangers,&quot; to be led by Captain Harry Love (a former Texas Ranger and Mexican War veteran).The state paid the California Rangers $150 a month, and promised them a $1,000 governor&#x27;s reward if they captured the wanted men. On July 25, 1853, a group of rangers encountered a band of armed Mexican men near Arroyo de Cantua on the edge of the Diablo Range near Coalinga. In the confrontation, three of the Mexicans were killed. The rangers claimed one of the dead was Murrieta, and another Manuel Garcia, also known as Three-Fingered Jack, one of his most notorious associates. Two others were captured.

A California Historical Landmark plaque has been installed near Coalinga at the intersection of State Routes 33 and 198 to mark the approximate site of the incident.

As proof of the outlaws&#x27; deaths, the Rangers cut off the hand of Three-Fingered Jack, and the alleged head of Murrieta. They preserved these in a jar of alcohol to bring to the authorities to claim their reward. Officials displayed the jar of remains in Mariposa County, Stockton, and San Francisco. The rangers took the display throughout California; spectators could pay $1 to see the relics.

Love and his rangers received the $1,000 reward money. In August 1853, an anonymous Los Angeles-based man wrote to the &quot;San Francisco Alta California Daily&quot;, claiming that Love and his rangers had murdered some innocent Mexican mustang catchers, and bribed people to swear out affidavits as to their identities. On May 28, 1854, the California State Legislature voted to reward the Rangers with another $5,000 (~$ in ) for their defeat of Murrieta and his band.

Some 25 years later, myths began to form about Murrieta. In 1879, O. P. Stidger reportedly heard Murrieta&#x27;s sister say that the displayed head was not her brother&#x27;s. At around the same time, numerous sightings were reported of Murrieta as a middle-aged man. These were never confirmed. His preserved head was destroyed during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire.

Murrieta&#x27;s nephew, known as Procopio, became one of California&#x27;s most notorious bandits of the 1860s and 1870s. He was said to have wanted to exceed the reputation of his uncle.

==The Real Zorro==
Murrieta is believed to have inspired the fictional character of &quot;Zorro&quot;, the lead character in the five-part serial story, &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, written by Johnston McCulley, and published in 1919 in a pulp fiction magazine.

For some political activists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Murrieta has symbolized Mexican resistance against White Anglo-Saxon Protestant domination of California, as Spanish colonists, Native Americans, &quot;mixtos&quot;, and independent Mexicans were there first. The &quot;Association of Descendants of Joaquin Murrieta&quot; says that Murrieta was not a &quot;&quot;gringo&quot; eater&quot;, but &quot;He wanted to retrieve the part of Mexico that was lost at that time in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&quot; (after the Mexican-American War).

==Representations in media==

<text>The gestational sac is the large cavity of fluid surrounding the embryo. During early embryogenesis, it consists of the extraembryonic coelom, also called the chorionic cavity. The gestational sac is normally contained within the uterus. It is the only available structure that can be used to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy exists until the embryo can be identified.

On obstetric ultrasound, the gestational sac is a dark (anechoic) space surrounded by a white (hyperechoic) rim.

==Structure==
The gestational sac is spherical in shape, and is usually located in the upper part (fundus) of the uterus. By approximately nine weeks of gestational age, due to folding of the trilaminar germ disc, the amniotic sac expands and occupy the majority of the volume of the gestational sac, eventually reducing the extraembryonic coelom (the gestational sac or the chorionic cavity) to a thin layer between the parietal somatopleuric and visceral splanchnopleuric layer of extraembryonic mesoderm.

===Development===
During embryogenesis, the &quot;extraembryonic coelom&quot; (or &quot;chorionic cavity&quot;) that constitutes the gestational sac is a portion of the conceptus consisting of a cavity between Heuser&#x27;s membrane and the trophoblast.

During formation of the primary yolk sac, some of the migrating hypoblast cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells that fill the space between Heuser&#x27;s membrane and the trophoblast, forming the extraembryonic mesoderm. As development progresses, small lacunae begin to form within the extraembryonic mesoderm which enlarges to become the extraembryonic coelom.

The Heuser&#x27;s membrane cells (hypoblast cells) that migrated along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secrete an extracellular matrix along the way. Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the extraembryonic coelom.

The extraembryonic coelom divides the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers: extraembryonic splanchnopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to Heuser&#x27;s membrane around the outside of the primary yolk sac, and extraembryonic somatopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to the cytotrophoblast layer of the embryo.

The chorionic cavity is enclosed by the chorionic plate, which is composed of an inner layer of somatopleuric mesoderm and an outer layer of trophoblast cells.

==Clinical significance==

===Ultrasound===

The mean sac diameter can effectively estimate the gestational age between 5 and 6 weeks, with an accuracy of about +/- 5 days.

The yolk sac and embryo should be readily identifiable when the gestational sac reaches a certain size — a yolk sac should be seen when the gestational sac is 20mm and a fetal pole should be seen when the gestational sac reaches 25mm.

Gestational sacs can be identified via ultrasound and are generally identified by the following four characteristics: 
# The sac has a round or elliptical shape in longitudinal and transverse views
# The sac is surrounded by a white echogenic rim (&quot;choriodecidual reaction&quot;) 
# The sac is located in the uterine fundus
# The sac is not implanted on the midline, but eccentrically (to one side of the uterine cavity line).

<text>Kuldip Singh Kular (born December 12, 1948) is an Indian-born Canadian politician and former Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011 representing the riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton.

==Background==
Kular was born and raised in a Sikh family in Ludhiana, Punjab, India and received a medical degree from Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar, Punjab, India. He moved to Canada in 1974, and completed two years of residency training in paediatrics at the IWK Health Centre at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He then worked for two years at the Canadian Armed Forces Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia before starting a family practice in Campbellton, New Brunswick in 1978.

In 1986, Kular founded a family and sports medicine clinic in Brampton, Ontario, a city which has a large number of recent Indian immigrants. He was also a founding member of the Northern Indian Medical and Dental Association of Canada.

==Politics==
In the 2003 election, Kular ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale. During the campaign, it came to light that Kular had previously been disciplined by the Physician&#x27;s Board. Despite the news, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Raminder Singh Gill by 3,765 votes. In June 2005, he was a member of the Speaker of the Ontario Legislature’s multi-party delegation in to the 43rd Canadian Regional Conference for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

In the 2007 election, Kular was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton, defeating the closest candidate, Progressive Conservative Pam Hundal, by about 6,000 votes.

In January, 2009, Kular was a member of the Premier&#x27;s delegation of government and business leaders who went on a trade mission to India to develop stronger ties with this emerging market.

In October 2009, Kular was involved in an incident where he allegedly hit a pedestrian while driving in Brampton. He was charged with leaving the scene of the accident. A month later Kular resigned as parliamentary assistant to the minister of Health and Long-Term Care. In June 2010, Kular was acquitted due to contradictory evidence from witnesses. Kular was subsequently reappointed to his old post as parliamentary assistant.

In the 2011 election, he was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Jagmeet Singh by 2,120 votes. He ran again in the 2014 election, again losing to Singh.

During his tenure, he served as parliamentary assistant to several ministers including Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Minister Responsible for Democratic Renewal, and to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

<doc id="1166331" wikidata="Q2336138" url="?curid=1166331" title="William Gilmore Simms">
<text>William Gilmore Simms (April 17, 1806 – June 11, 1870) was a poet, novelist, politician and historian from the American South. His writings achieved great prominence during the 19th century, with Edgar Allan Poe pronouncing him the best novelist America had ever produced. He is still known among literary scholars as a major force in antebellum Southern literature. He is also remembered for his strong support of slavery and for his opposition to &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, in response to which he wrote reviews and the pro-slavery novel &quot;The Sword and the Distaff&quot; (1854). During his literary career he served as editor of several journals and newspapers and he also served in the South Carolina House of Representatives.

==Early and family life==
Simms was born on April 17, 1806, in Charleston, South Carolina, of Scots-Irish ancestors. His mother, Harriet Ann Augusta (&quot;née&quot; Singleton, 1784–1808) died during his infancy; his father William Gilmore Simms Senior (1762–1830) failed in business and joined Coffee&#x27;s Indian fighters. Simms was raised by his maternal grandmother, Jane Miller Singleton Gates, who had lived through the American Revolutionary War and who told Simms stories about it.

In his teen years, Simms worked as a clerk in a drugstore and aspired to study medicine. Simms began to study law when he was eighteen (circa 1824). He would receive an honorary LLD from the University of Alabama in 1841.

He married Anna Malcolm Giles in 1826. After her death, he married Chevillette Eliza Roach (pronounced &quot;Roche&quot;), with whom he had 14 children, only 5 of whom lived to adulthood. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1827; however, he soon abandoned this profession for literature.

=== Early writings ===
Simms first wrote poetry at the age of eight. In his 19th year, he produced a monody on General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (Charleston, 1825). Two years later, in 1827, he published &quot;Lyrical and Other Poems and Early Lays&quot;. In 1828 he became a journalist as well as editor and part owner of the &quot;City Gazette&quot;, a position he held until 1832 when the publication failed. Simms devoted his attention entirely to writing and in rapid succession published &quot;The Vision of Cortes, Cain, and Other Poems&quot; (1829); &quot;The Tricolor, or Three Days of Blood in Paris&quot; (1830); and his strongest long poem, &quot;Atalantis, a Tale of the Sea&quot; (1832). &quot;Atalantis&quot; established his fame as an author. 

His novel &quot;Martin Faber, the Story of a Criminal&quot;, an expanded version of an earlier short story called &quot;The Confessions of a Murderer,&quot; was published in 1833. Though not considered one of the author’s major works, this novella proved consequential for Simms’s career in two ways.  First, “it was the publication of &quot;Martin Faber&quot; that changed a poet into a novelist,” as the modest success of this first book-length fiction from the writer launched the prose career that would dominate the rest of Simms’s professional life. Second, &quot;Martin Faber&quot; is highly innovative in its adaption of Gothic tropes to southern fiction.  This, combined with the fact that its publication predates the earliest Gothic works of Poe, makes Simms, “for all practical purposes, the founder of the Southern Gothic genre.” The novel, thus, gained Simms a national audience.

Simms also edited several South Carolina newspapers, and in the 1840s and 1850s edited important southern journals, including the &quot;Magnolia&quot;, the &quot;Southern and Western,&quot; and the proslavery &quot;Southern Quarterly Review.&quot; During the nullification controversy prompted by South Carolina in 1832, Simms supported Union. In the 1840s he pushed for American freedom from British literary models and supported the intensely nationalistic Young America group.

Based on the popularity of the novels described below, Simms became part of the Southern planter class. He came to firmly support slavery (a &quot;fire-eater&quot;), an attitude that when held widely by Southerners helped lead to secession and creation of the Confederate States of America and the American Civil War. Elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, Simms served from 1844 to 1846. However he lost election for lieutenant governor of South Carolina by only one vote.

=== Novels about the South ===
Simms wrote a number of popular books between 1830 and 1860, sometimes focusing on the pre-colonial and colonial periods of Southern history, and replete with local color. His first success was with &quot;The Yemassee&quot; (1835, about the Yemassee War of 1715 in the South Carolina low country). Simms also published eight novels set in South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, beginning with &quot;&quot; (1835), which was perhaps Simms&#x27;s most-read novel, and &quot;Katharine Walton&quot; (1851). Other South Carolina-related books included &quot;Mellichampe&quot; (1836), &quot;The Kinsmen&quot; (1841), &quot;Woodcraft&quot; (1854), &quot;The Forayers&quot; (1855), &quot;Eutaw&quot; (1856), and &quot;Joscelyn&quot; (1867).

He later published ten novels dealing with the expansion into the frontier territory from Georgia to Louisiana, including &quot;Richard Hurdis; or, the Avenger of Blood. A Tale of Alabama&quot; (1838) and &quot;Border Beagles: A Tale of Mississippi&quot; (1840). He also wrote about the conflicts between Native Americans, Spaniards and French in Florida in &quot;The Lily and the Totem, or, The Huguenots in Florida&quot; (1850); &quot;Vasconselos&quot; (1853; an account of DeSoto&#x27;s expedition from the Native American viewpoint); and the overlapping experiences of Native Americans, Spanish, and English in &quot;The Cassique of Kiawah&quot; (1859; a novel set during the 1680s in Colonial-era Charleston). Regarding America&#x27;s native population, Simms once said that &quot;Our blinding prejudices... have been fostered as necessary to justify the reckless and unsparing hand with which [white Americans] have smitten them in their habitations and expelled them from their country.&quot;

At first, Southern readers, especially those in his home town of Charleston, did not support Simms&#x27;s work, in part because he lacked an aristocratic background. Eventually, however, he was referred to as the Southern version of James Fenimore Cooper, and Charleston residents invited him into their prestigious St. Cecilia Society.
In 1845, Simms published &quot;The Wigwam and the Cabin&quot; (1845); a compilation of short stories, one of which describes a loyal slave. Edgar Allan Poe thought the collection &quot;decidedly the most American of American books&quot;. and declared Simms to be &quot;immeasurably the greatest writer of fiction in America.&quot; In 1852, Simms published &quot;As Good as A Comedy; Or, The Tennessean&#x27;s Story.&quot; It and &quot;Paddy McGann&quot; (1867) constitute his two full-length works of Southern humor; he also wrote &quot;Sharp Snaffles&quot; and &quot;Bill Bauldy&quot;, two tall tales. He also wrote poetry and, in a letter to literary critic and poet Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Simms said that he was not interested in form as much as content, torn &quot;between the desire to appear correct, and the greater desire to be original and true&quot;.

=== Nonfiction history and biography ===
Simms&#x27; &quot;History of South Carolina&quot; (1842) served for several generations as the standard school textbook on the state&#x27;s history. He also wrote &quot;The Social Principle: The True Source of National Permanence&quot; (1843) and several very popular biographies of Revolutionary War heroes Francis Marion, Nathanael Greene, and John Laurens. He also penned a compendium of Captain John Smith&#x27;s works covering the founding of the Virginia Colony as well as a book detailing the Chevalier Bayard. Simms wrote a history of Alabama, and was a popular lecturer on American history. He accumulated one of the largest collections of Revolutionary War manuscripts in the country. Most of this collection was lost when camp followers of the Union Army burned his home, &quot;Woodlands&quot;, located near Bamberg, SC.

=== Pro-slavery writings ===

Simms strongly supported slavery. In the November 1837 issue of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, Simms published a lengthy review of English social reformer Harriet Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Society in America&quot;, a review that essentially functioned as an extended defense of slavery. This essay would be published as a standalone pamphlet the next year under the title &quot;Slavery in America&quot;; the essay would be republished in 1852 under the title &quot;The Morals of Slavery&quot; as part of the edited volume &quot;The Pro-Slavery Argument&quot;. Simms was very critical of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and wrote negative reviews. Some scholars have argued that his 1852 novel &quot;The Sword and the Distaff&quot;--republished in a slightly revised edition in 1854 under the title &quot;Woodcraft&quot;--is an example of Anti-Tom literature; these scholars often rely on the readings of Joseph V. Ridgely. Other scholars see Ridgely&#x27;s reading as faulty, citing an excessive reliance placed on an offhand remark Simms makes in a letter from 1852 and problems with the chronology of Simms&#x27;s composition of Woodcraft alongside the publication of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. 

Simms was part of a &quot;sacred circle&quot; of southern intellectuals including Edmund Ruffin, James Henry Hammond, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and George Frederick Holmes. Together they published numerous articles calling for moral reform of the South, including a stewardship role of masters in relation to slavery. 

=== American Civil War and final years ===

During the American Civil War, Simms espoused the side of the Secessionists in a weekly newspaper. Only his eldest son, who shared his name, was old enough to serve in the Confederate army, and because of the common name, his identification as a volunteer or conscript private is unclear. While it appears most likely that camp followers of the Union Army burned Simms&#x27;s house, &quot;Woodlands&quot;, one of the previously enslaved people there, Isaac Nimmons, was charged but acquitted of the arson. In the fire a reported 10,000 books and Revolutionary era manuscripts perished.

Other than for the backwoods novel &quot;Paddy McGann&quot; (1863), Simms published little after the Civil War began. He advised several southern politicians and made elaborate proposals for Confederate military defenses. During the war, he wrote little of literary importance.

At the end of the Civil War, his reputation in tatters as a result of his vocal support of both slavery and secession, Simms attempted without success to relaunch his literary career. He compiled an uneven anthology of Southern war poems in 1866. He died of colon cancer in Charleston on June, 11, 1870 and was posthumously inducted into the South Carolina Academy of Authors in 1986.

==Death and legacy==

Simms died of cancer at his eldest daughter&#x27;s home at 13 Society Street in Charleston on June 11, 1870. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery. A large bronze bust of Simms is centrally located in Charleston&#x27;s Battery Park. The bust was sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward with a granite base designed by Edward Brickell White. The monument was dedicated in 1879.

In 2016, the family had a ceremony honoring him in Hanahan, South Carolina.

===Posthumous reputation===
Scholars at DocSouth note Simms&#x27;s volume of work describes the historic and cultural diversity of the South, from the class hierarchy, sectional self-consciousness and agrarian economy of the Low Country; to both the violence and civilization of the Gulf South (which had both plantations and frontier); and the pioneering of the Appalachian Mountains. David Aiken, an editorial board member of the white nationalist, neo-Confederate, white supremacist organization The League of the South, lamented that Simms was purged from the canon of American literature because of the &quot;unpardonable sin Simms committed when he published an account of Columbia, South Carolina&#x27;s destruction in which he dared to deny the North a righteous victory.&quot; Simms asserted of the North&#x27;s tactics in the Civil War, &quot;whatever might have existed in virtue of their cause, is forfeit by the processes which they have taken for its maintenance.&quot; Author and segregationist Donald Davidson claimed, &quot;The neglect of Simms&#x27;s stature is nothing less than a scandal when it results...in the disappearance of his books from the common market and therefore from the readers&#x27; bookshelf. This is literary murder&quot;.

Literary scholars and historians continue to recognize Simms as a major force in Antebellum literature and a leading intellectual. The University of South Carolina has digitized most of his works and papers, which have been digitized by the available as print on demand books. During recent years, a &quot;Simms Renaissance&quot; has included scholars such as James E. Kibler, Mary Ann Wimsatt, Sean Busick, Charles S. Watson, and John C. Guilds. Kibler may be currently the leading authority on Simms&#x27;s poetry; Guilds produced the major biography of the prolific author; Busick has concentrated on Simms&#x27;s work as a historian; Wimsatt has published &quot;The Major Fiction of William Gilmore Simms&quot; as well as an edited version of his short stories, titled &quot;Tales of the South&quot; (a writer for &quot;The Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; called Wimsatt&#x27;s introduction to the tales &quot;magisterial&quot;). Contributing to the renaissance is a journal titled &quot;The Simms Review&quot;. Issued annually, it contains recent articles about the author.

<text>The fetal pole is a thickening on the margin of the yolk sac of a fetus during pregnancy.
It is usually identified at six weeks with vaginal ultrasound and at six and a half weeks with abdominal ultrasound. However, it is not unheard of for the fetal pole to not be visible until about 9 weeks. The fetal pole may be seen at 2–4 mm crown-rump length (CRL).

<doc id="1166343" wikidata="Q369887" url="?curid=1166343" title="Yolk sac">
<text>The yolk sac is a membranous attached to an embryo, formed by cells of the hypoblast layer of the bilaminar embryonic disc. This is alternatively called the umbilical vesicle by the Terminologia Embryologica (TE), though &quot;yolk sac&quot; is far more widely used. The yolk sac is one of the fetal membranes and is important in early embryonic blood supply. In humans much of it is incorporated into the primordial gut during the fourth week of embryonic development.

==In humans==
The yolk sac is the first element seen within the gestational sac during pregnancy, usually at three days gestation.

The yolk sac is situated on the front (ventral) part of the embryo; it is lined by extra-embryonic endoderm, outside of which is a layer of extra-embryonic mesenchyme, derived from the epiblast.

Blood is conveyed to the wall of the yolk sac by the primitive aorta and after circulating through a wide-meshed capillary plexus, is returned by the vitelline veins to the tubular heart of the embryo. This constitutes the vitelline circulation, which in humans serves as a location of haematopoiesis. Before the placenta is formed and can take over, the yolk sac provides nutrition and gas exchange between the mother and the developing embryo.

At the end of the fourth week, the yolk sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped opening (traditionally called the &quot;umbilical vesicle&quot;), into the digestive tube by a long narrow tube, the vitelline duct. Rarely, the yolk sac can be seen in the afterbirth as a small, somewhat oval-shaped body whose diameter varies from 1 mm to 5 mm; it is situated between the amnion and the chorion and may lie on or at a varying distance from the placenta. There is no clinical significance to a residual external yolk sac.

As a rule, the vitelline duct undergoes complete obliteration by the 20th week as most of the yolk sac is incorporated into the developing gastrointestinal tract. But in about two percent of cases its proximal part persists as a diverticulum from the small intestine, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, which is situated about 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the navel.

Sometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct.

==Histogenesis==
The yolk sac starts forming during the second week of the embryonic development, at the same time as the shaping of the amniotic sac. The hypoblast starts proliferating laterally and descending. In the meantime Heuser&#x27;s membrane, located on the opposite pole of the developing vesicle, starts its upward proliferation and meets the hypoblast.

==Modifications==
*Primary yolk sac: it is the vesicle which develops in the second week, its floor is represented by Heuser&#x27;s membrane and its ceiling by the hypoblast. It is also known as the exocoelomic cavity.
*Secondary yolk sac: this structure is formed when the extraembryonic mesoderm separates to form the extraembryonic coelom; cells from the mesoderm pinch off an area of the yolk sac, and what remains is the secondary yolk sac.
*The final yolk sac: during the fourth week of development, during organogenesis, part of the yolk sac is surrounded by endoderm and incorporated into the embryo as the gut. The remaining part of the yolk sac is the final yolk sac.

==Additional images==
== Other animals ==
The yolk sac is an ancient structure. It is found in fish and probably the last common ancestor of vertebrates. The fish structure was innovated upon by the amniotes (reptiles, birds, and later mammals), which evolved bigger yolks and tougher eggs for life on land. The placental mammalian yolk sac is a further elaboration of the amniote structure.

<text>The A7 motorway, also known as the Corinth–Tripoli–Kalamata Motorway (), or the Central Peloponnese motorway (), is a controlled-access highway in the Peloponnese, Greece. The A7 begins just west of the Isthmus of Corinth, branching off from Greek National Road 8A (which is now integrated into the Olympia Odos). It connects Corinth and Kalamata via Tripoli.

As part of the concession agreement between the Greek state and the consortium operating the motorway (Moreas S.A.), the latter is responsible for constructing, operating, maintaining and modernizing the A7. In existing sections of the motorway, improvements include the straightening of dangerous curves, constructing new tunnels, completing the Artemision tunnel, adding more light fixtures and upgrading the median throughout.

==Length==
*Corinth to Tripoli: 74 km (46 mi)
*Corinth to Kalamata: 147 km (91 mi)
*Lefktro to Sparta: 45,5 km (28 mi)
*Total length: 205 km (127 mi)

==History and additional information==
The Corinth-Tripoli segment was constructed between 1984 and 1990. It officially became part of the Greek road network in 1992. Prior to that, the Greek National Road 7 (GR-7) was the only road connecting Corinth and Tripoli via Nemea / Dervenakia, Argos and Achladokampos. This was a two-lane road with dangerous curves, especially in the &quot;Kolosoúrtis&quot; (Κωλοσούρτης) section west of Myli; the road exists to this day and is open to local traffic. The A7 motorway has been credited with spearheading Tripoli&#x27;s economic growth. The southern end is also the ring road of Kalamata city, distributing to the local agriculture and industrial economy, as well. In the late months of 2016 the road became fully operative from one end to the other.

==Operation and maintenance==

Moreas S.A. () is responsible for the operation and maintenance of both the A7 and A71 motorways, which are sometimes known collectively as the Moreas Motorway (). The company was founded in Nestani on 22 December 2006, and is a consortium of Ellaktor as the majority shareholder (71.67%), AVAX (15%), and Intrakat (13.33%).

Moreas S.A. operates the A7 and A71 under a 30-year public–private partnership agreement with the Greek government, from 3 March 2008 to 3 March 2038.

<text>Murupara is a town in the Whakatāne District and Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The town is in an isolated part of the region between the Kaingaroa Forest and Te Urewera protected area, on the banks of the Rangitaiki River, 65 kilometres southeast of Rotorua. Indigenous Māori also make up over 90% of the population.

It is on SH38 and is the terminus of the Murupara Railway Branch. The town&#x27;s principal industries are all related to forestry.

This area is now known as the Kaingaroa Forest, with 1,400 square kilometres of planted pines. As the main service centre for the many forestry workers and their families, Murupara grew to a population of over 3,000. Recent changes to the forestry contracting system have brought about a decrease in the number of permanent residents.

The settlements of Galatea, Horomanga, Kopuriki, Aniwhenua, Waiohau and Murupara lie between the boundary of the Kaingaroa Forest, the popular Te Urewera and Whirinaki Te Pua-a-Tāne Conservation Park. Earlier history is also evident around Murupara. In a rock shelter approximately eight kilometres west of the town centre are a number of ancient cave drawings.

Murupara was regarded as being a &quot;gang town&quot; but local iwi have placed a (ban) on gang patches from being worn at the local marae and school.

<doc id="1166368" wikidata="Q1513756" url="?curid=1166368" title="Summertime Blues">
<text>&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; is a song co-written and recorded by the American rock artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 29, 1958, and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by Blue Cheer, the Who and Brian Setzer, the last of whom recorded his version for the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba&quot;, in which he portrayed Cochran.

==Lyrics==
The song is about the struggle between a teenager and his parents, his boss and his congressman during the summer. The narrator resents having to take a job in order to earn pocket money, and he cannot go on a date with his girlfriend because his boss keeps scheduling him to work late. After falsely telling the boss he is sick in order to get out of going to work, his parents will not let him use their car due to his laziness. Finally, he considers visiting the United Nations to complain about his situation; he settles for writing to his congressman, who brushes him off since he is too young to vote.

==Eddie Cochran version==
&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; was recorded on March 28, 1958, at Gold Star Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Eddie Cochran sang both the vocal and bass vocal (the &quot;work-a-late&quot; portions, Cochran&#x27;s tribute to the Kingfish character from the &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; television series), played all the guitar parts, and added the hand clapping with possibly Sharon Sheeley. Connie &#x27;Guybo&#x27; Smith played the electric bass and Earl Palmer drums.

===Legacy===
The 1958 Liberty Records single by Eddie Cochran was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 and the song is ranked number 73 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed it at number 77 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. The song is also on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum list of &quot;The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The song appears in the films &quot;Untamed Youth&quot; performed by Cochran, &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;American Shaolin&quot;, as well as season 4 of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Waylon Jennings references Eddie Cochran and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; in his song, &quot;The Stage:Stars In Heaven&quot; with the lines, &quot;A mighty cheer brings Eddie Cochran on, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; brings a happy roar and the crowd cheers loud as they call for more. The song is also featured in the 2010 video game Mafia II.

===Chart performance===
==Johnny Chester version==

Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer Johnny Chester cited Cochran as one of his idols and had used the track when rehearsing his first band in 1959. Chester released his cover version on W&amp;G Records in 1962 and was backed on the recording by local instrumental group the Chessmen, with Bert Stacpool on piano, his brother Les Stacpool on guitar, Frank McMahon on bass guitar, and Graeme Trottman on drums. In December it peaked at No. 30 on the Kent Music Report.

== Hep Stars version ==
Swedish rock band Hep Stars recorded Summertime Blues as a single in late December 1964. It was a six-hour, consecutive session in which the Hep Stars recorded six tracks: &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Farmer John&quot;, &quot;If You Need Me&quot;, &quot;Bird Dog&quot; and &quot;Donna&quot;. The sessions for these were the first professional recordings of keyboardist Benny Andersson, later of ABBA fame. Their manager, Åke Gerhard had booked the recording sessions, as cheaply as he possibly could get away with. He booked Borgarskolan in central Stockholm and quickly turned it into a makeshift recording studio. Andersson would later comment on the sessions:

Of these tracks, only &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; was released as a single in February 1965. While that initially failed to chart, their increasing popularity was fueled by their March 23, 1965 appearance on &quot;Drop-In&quot; which quickly made &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; climb the charts. This prompted Gerhard and his record label Olga Records to quickly issue &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; &quot;Farmer John&quot; and &quot;Cadillac&quot; as singles in late March 1965. While &quot;Farmer John&quot;, &quot;Cadillac&quot; and &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; peaked at number 1, 2 and 4 at the same time on &quot;Tio i Topp&quot;, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; missed the charts altogether. This was most likely due to the fact that guitarist Janne Frisk provided lead vocals on the track, as opposed to Svenne Hedlund singing it. &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; became the Hep Stars only singles to feature Frisk on lead vocals.

While not issued on any album at the time, it, along with the B-Side were issued as bonus material on the 1996 remaster of their debut album &quot;We and Our Cadillac&quot;

=== Personnel ===
* Janne Frisk – guitar, lead vocals
* Christer Pettersson – drums
* Benny Andersson – keyboards, piano
* Lennart Hegland – bass guitar

==Blue Cheer version==

The American rock band Blue Cheer recorded their version of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; in 1967 and included it on their 1968 release entitled &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot;. The single peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, pushing the sales of the album even higher to number 11. It topped the Dutch charts for one week in 1968. This version was ranked number 73 on the list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot; of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

===Chart performance===

==The Who version==

The Who played &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; as a staple of their concerts from their early days up to 1976, with intermittent appearances thereafter. It has not been played since the death of bassist John Entwistle in 2002. It was performed during the 1967 US tour, from which the first known Who recordings of the song were made, including a June 1967 date at the Monterey Pop Festival.

The first version to be released by the Who appeared on the 1970 album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;. The single from this album peaked at number 38 in the UK and number 27 in the US. &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of &#x27;Summertime Blues&#x27; on that album,&quot; remarked Rush bassist Geddy Lee, &quot;which we covered &quot;[see below]&quot; to a large degree because of their version.&quot;

This version by the Who differed from the original in both the sense of aggression and volume. As lead singer Roger Daltrey noted, &quot;We&#x27;d taken the song from being in kind of a swing rhythm on the off-beat to a rock rhythm on the one.&quot; Entwistle would sing the bass parts on the song, but the band struggled to capture the same energy of it in the studio. The live version recorded at the Leeds show managed to capture this fully.

===Studio version===

The Who recorded at least two studio versions of this track in 1967. They went unreleased until 1998 and 2009, when they appeared on the remastered CD of &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot; and the deluxe edition of &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;, respectively. Other live versions from the Who are featured in the &quot;Monterey Pop Festival&quot; CD box set and the concert and documentary film &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970), as well as &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot; and the CD release of &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying that the Who gave it a &quot;wild updating&quot; and was &quot;certain to put them right up there at the top.&quot;

===Chart performance===

==Buck Owens version==

In 1988, Country singer Buck Owens released a cover version of the song for his comeback album &quot;&quot;Hot Dog!&quot;, released in November that year, produced by Jim Shaw. In said album, Owens resurrected the rockabilly sound of his earlier works. The album also featured a cover of another rock and roll classic, &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot; by Chuck Berry (Owens&#x27;s version titled as, &quot;Memphis&quot;&quot;, a common shortened title of the latter song). Though not released as a single nor charted, This cover version would later inspire Alan Jackson&#x27;s country version in 1994 as noted by Jackson, a hit in the country charts in the US and Canada that year.

==Alan Jackson version==
American country music artist Alan Jackson recorded the song for his 1994 album, &quot;Who I Am&quot;. It was released in June 1994 as the lead single from the album and the song reached Number One on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 (equivalent to number 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). Jackson said that he was inspired by Buck Owens&#x27; version.

===Critical reception===

Deborah Evans Price of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying that Jackson &quot;gives the oft-covered Eddie Cochran oldie the full, twangy &#x27;Chattahoochee&#x27; treatment.&quot; She goes on to say that &quot;until the vocal starts, you may not know which song you&#x27;re listening to. But who cares?&quot; She says that with his &quot;signature laid-back vocal style, the long, tall Georgian turns this &#x27;50s teen anthem into a &#x27;90s country classic.&quot; Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe reviewed the song unfavorably, saying that Jackson blatantly attempted to recreate the &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; phenomenon. He goes on to say that the &quot;charm of the Eddie Cochran original is lost by forcing those country line-dance beats into the backing track.&quot;

===Music video===

The video was directed by Michael Salomon and was released in June 1994. Considered by Jackson as the &quot;sequel&quot; to his &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; video a year earlier, it was also the only video of his that Salomon directed. It begins with a shot of him water-skiing (which ends the &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; video) before transitioning to him and a band performing the song while seated in the bed of a pickup. Many 4-wheelers, ATVs and a limo full of middle-aged farmers are seen riding through the mud and getting stuck. Jackson, in a plain white t-shirt, is seen riding around in the mud in his pickup before getting out and walking in between many people fighting in the mud. However, he stays stainless until the very end, where he only gets one small spot of mud on the left side of his shirt before finally joining in the tussle. It ends with Jackson posing as a scarecrow.

===Chart positions===

&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; debuted at number 53 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks for the week of June 18, 1994.
===Year-end charts===

==Rush version==

Canadian rock band Rush released their cover as a single on May 21, 2004. It was later included on their cover EP &quot;Feedback&quot;, released on June 29. The song was the theme for the WWE SummerSlam event on August 15, 2004. The song was performed live during the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary tour later that year, and was included on the &quot;R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour&quot; concert DVD. The fourth line of each verse is omitted.

===Chart positions===

===Personnel===
* Geddy Lee – lead vocals, bass
* Alex Lifeson – guitar
* Neil Peart – drums, percussion

==Johnny Hallyday version (in French)==
The song was covered in French by Johnny Hallyday. His version (titled &quot;La Fille de l&#x27;été dernier&quot;, meaning &quot;Last Summer&#x27;s Girl&quot;) was released on Philips Records (the same label that released Blue Cheer&#x27;s version) in April 1975 for Hallyday&#x27;s nineteenth studio album &quot;Rock à Memphis&quot;, released one month later and spent one week at no. 1 on the singles sales chart in France (from May 10 to 16, 1975). Hallyday had previously recorded an adaption of another one of Cochran&#x27;s songs, &quot;&quot;Cut Across Shorty&quot; (the last song the former had ever recorded before his death) in 1968 as &quot;Cours plus vite Charlie&quot;&quot; (&quot;Run faster Charlie&quot;), with Also adapted into French by Long Chris. The single is backed by a French adaption of the Larry Williams song, &quot;&quot;Slow Down&quot;, titled &quot;Dégage&quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;Cleared&quot;).

<text>Antonio Alberto García Guerrero (February 6, 1886November 7, 1959) was a Chilean composer, pianist, and teacher. While he is most famously remembered as the mentor of Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, García influenced several generations of musicians through his many years of teaching at the Toronto Conservatory of Music.

==Biography==
Born in La Serena, Chile, Guerrero first studied piano with his mother and older brother Daniel; he was otherwise self-taught. After the family moved to Santiago in the early 1890s, he became part of a group of artists and intellectuals who called themselves Los Diez. As a resourceful composer and talented concert pianist, Guerrero would have a reform-minded influence on Chilean musical life. His brother Eduardo became a music critic and Alberto contributed articles and reviews to the newspaper &quot;El diario ilustrado&quot;. He published a treatise in 1915 entitled &quot;La armonia moderna&quot; (now lost).

Guerrero introduced Chilean audiences to the modern music of his day, including works by Debussy, Ravel, Cyril Scott, Scriabin, and Schoenberg. He founded and conducted Santiago&#x27;s first symphony orchestra and was active in founding the Sociedad Bach in 1917.

In 1918, during a honeymoon trip to New York City, Guerrero came in contact with members of the Hambourg family, who invited him to teach at the recently established Hambourg Conservatory in Toronto. Guerrero accepted this position and emigrated to Canada with his wife and daughter the following year.

In Toronto, Guerrero performed for a few years with the Hambourg Trio (having replaced pianist Mark Hambourg). While he shifted his focus to piano technique and pedagogy, he expanded his performing repertory to include works from Purcell through Les Six. As one of Canada&#x27;s most active pianists, he played regular radio recitals (a highly innovative move at the time) beginning in the mid-1920s and through to the early 1950s. He also initiated a subscription series of solo recitals from 1932 to 1937. Each season&#x27;s four or five recitals would cover often neglected works by Bach, Alessandro Scarlatti, Haydn, Mozart, 18th-century Spanish composers, 20th-century French composers, and Stravinsky. Bach pieces included the complete inventions and sinfonias as well as the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, all of which would be later popularized by his pupil Glenn Gould. Guerrero performed in various chamber ensembles with musicians such as with Frank Blachford (violin), Leo Smith (cello), Harold Sumberg (violin), and Cornelius Ysselstyn (cello). For over a decade, he was also a member of the Five Piano Ensemble.

In 1922, Guerrero left the Hambourg Conservatory and joined the Toronto Conservatory of Music (Royal Conservatory of Music), where he remained until his death in Toronto in 1959, having established himself as one of Canada&#x27;s preeminent music teachers.

Guerrero was known to be quiet and focused. His near self-effacement instead gave rise to the most prominent Canadian musicians of the late 20th century. He had a decisive technical and aesthetic influence on Glenn Gould, whom he mentored for 10 years, even though Gould would later claim to be self-taught. Guerrero was also known for his keen intellect and eloquence vis-à-vis painting, poetry, and philosophy (Comte, Husserl, Sartre). &quot;He was one of the few musicians from whom a student would get a vista of ideas beyond music,&quot; recalls composer R. Murray Schafer, who composed &quot;In Memoriam Alberto Guerrero&quot; a few months after his teacher&#x27;s death.

==Compositions==
Guerrero had been known as a versatile composer in Santiago. In addition to a number of chamber works and piano solos, he wrote music for 4 or 5 operettas and zarzuelas (now lost) which were produced in Chile between 1908 and 1915. However, after moving to Canada, Guerrero focused more on teaching, though a couple of piano works (&quot;Tango&quot; and &quot;Southern Seas&quot;) were published in 1937. He also collaborated with his second wife Myrtle Rose Guerrero to co-author &quot;The New Approach to the Piano&quot; (2 vols., 1935–36).

==Students==

<text>Māhia Peninsula () is located on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region, between the towns of Wairoa and Gisborne.

It includes Rocket Lab&#x27;s Launch Complex 1, located near Ahuriri Point at the southern tip of the Māhia Peninsula, for launching its Electron rockets.

Since 2018, it has been used as a commercial launcher of small satellites in the range of 135–235 kg, and miniature satellites called CubeSats. New Zealand&#x27;s first orbital space launch took place from Launch Complex 1 on 21 January 2018.

==Geography==

==History and culture==
===Māori history===
In Maori legend, Whatonga, who came to New Zealand in search of his grandfather Toi, settled at Mahia.

The peninsula is the tribal area of the Ngāti Rongomaiwahine iwi. The word &quot;māhia&quot; means &quot;indistinct sound&quot; or &quot;scrofulous swelling&quot;.
The name &quot;Te Māhia&quot; comes from &quot;Te Māhia-mai-tawhiti&quot; (the sound heard from a distance).

Portland Island, also called Waikawa, is a small island off the southern tip of Mahia Peninsula. It was named &quot;Waikawa&quot; by Kahungunu when he visited there to look for fresh drinking water and only found salt water – Waikawa means &quot;sour water&quot;. Portland Island had a lighthouse, first lit in February 1878 and then replaced with a fully electrified unmanned town in 1955 .

===European history===
Shore whaling was briefly important on the Mahia Peninsula. Early whalers had a whaling station on the farm &quot;Kini Kini&quot;, sheltered by &quot;Long Point&quot; on the west coast of the peninsula. The peninsula community these days is still generally a mix of Maori and European. 

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was proposed to by her partner, Clarke Gayford, on Mokotahi Hill.

===Marae===
There are five marae in the Mahia area affiliated with the hapū of Rongomaiwahine  iwi:

* The Kaiuku or Oku-ra-renga Marae and its Kiwi meeting house are affiliated with the hapū of Ngāi Tama and Ngāi Tū
* Te Rākatō Marae is affiliated with the hapū of Ngāi Te Rākatō.
* Tuahuru Marae and its Hine te Rongo meeting house are affiliated with the hapū of Ngai Tama and Ngāi Tū.
* Ruawharo Marae is also affiliated with Ngai Tama. 
* Mahanga Marae and its meeting house, Te Poho o Rongomaiwahine, are home to the hapū, Te Hokowhitu o Ngai Tu.

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,949,075 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade 24 Ngāti Kahungunu marae, including both Kaiuku and Ruawharo Marae, creating 164 jobs. It also committed $102,644 to upgrading Tuahuru Marae, creating 4 jobs.

==Economy==

Sheep and cattle farms are an important part for the local community, but tourism is now the peninsula&#x27;s main industry. Mahia&#x27;s population swells greatly during the warmer months and in particular during school holidays.

Mahia is well known for its surf, scuba diving, hiking, and fishing. Morere Hot Springs is 15 minutes away, towards Gisborne. The area is a popular school holiday destination and contains a holiday park dating back to the 1960s. The remaining settlement consists mostly of holiday houses and baches.

From 2007 to 2010 Mahia became known for the presence of Moko, a dolphin.

The peninsula is the location of Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, which is used to launch commercial and government satellites on the company&#x27;s Electron orbital launch vehicle. 

==Education==
Te Mahia School is a year 1–8 co-educational state primary school. It is a decile 1 school with a roll of as of The school opened in 1917.

<doc id="1166376" wikidata="Q6474632" url="?curid=1166376" title="Lake-burst">
<text>A lake-burst (, ) is a phenomenon referred to in Irish mythology, in which a previously non-existent lake comes into being, often when a grave is being dug. Part of the lake-burst stories may originate in sudden hydrographic changes around limestone-based inland plains or turloughs. Other so-called lake-bursts refer to marine estuaries, bays and inlets, such as Galway Bay, Strangford Lough, Dundrum Bay, Belfast Lough, Waterford Harbour and the mouth of the River Erne. Some of these coastal districts were renowned for the drowned prehistoric forests, which gave rise to several flood-myths.

Medieval bards had a special genre of lake-burst poems called &quot;tomamond&quot;. More or less elaborate 11th- or 12th-century narratives have survived around Galway Bay, Lough Neagh and Lough Ree, which seem to be related to similar (though less ancient) stories in Wales (Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod, Llys Helig, Bala Lake, Llynclys), Cornwall (Lyonesse), Brittany (Ys) and Normandy (Forêt de Scissy). A late 16th-century Frisian legend, probably borrowed from Irish examples, refers to the origins of the Zuiderzee. Other Irish texts refer to the eruption of the River Boyne and other rivers. The poems of the lake-burst of Lough Erne and the eruption of Brí (where the legendary character Midir lived) have been lost. In Wales the flood myth is elaborated in the story of Dwyfan and Dwyfach, who saved people and animals from the great deluge caused by the monster Avanc living in &quot;Llyn Llion&quot; (possibly Bala Lake). Its Irish counterpart as told in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; only links up with the Biblical story of Noah&#x27;s flood.

The theme relates to the classical story of the warrior Marcus Curtius, who was said to have thrown himself in the Lacus Curtius near the Forum Romanum in order to stop a chasm made by the river Tiber. A similar story was told about King Midas.

==Identification==
Not every lake mentioned in medieval sources can be identified with certainty. &quot;Loch Lainglinne&quot;, for instance, might be another reference to Belfast Lough, which was known as &quot;Loch Laoigh&quot; or &quot;Loch Laigh&quot;.

Apparently, medieval Irishmen were convinced that almost all of their lakes had emerged after Noah&#x27;s flood. Their myths suggest that land reclamation and deforestation went hand in hand with the seasonal inundation of low-lying plains. According to the corrupted text of &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; king Partholón found only three lakes or bays: &quot;Loch Fordremain&quot; in &quot;Sliab Mis&quot; of &quot;Mumhan&quot; (Tralee Bay), &quot;Loch Lumnig&quot; (probably &quot; Loch Lurgan&quot; or Galway Bay) on &quot;Tir Find&quot; and &quot;Loch Cera&quot; or &quot;Findloch&quot; over the borders of Irrus. Interestingly enough, several major lakes and outlets, such as Lough Corrib, Lough Derg (Shannon), Shannon Estuary and Killary Harbour are not mentioned in any known myth. This may imply that at least some lake-bursts mentioned have been wrongly identified with smaller lakes, where, in fact, they may have been referring to one of the major lakes. The cave of St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory on Station Island in Lough Derg (Ulster), moreover, was identified in the &quot;Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii&quot; as the entrance to the Underworld.

The plains that supposedly had been drowned, had special names, which have been preserved in a 16th-century manuscript.

<doc id="1166379" wikidata="Q1229342" url="?curid=1166379" title="Victor Sen Yung">
<text>Victor Sen Yung (born Victor Cheung Young or Sen Yew Cheung; October 18, 1915 – body discovered November 9, 1980) was an American character actor, best known for playing Jimmy Chan in the Charlie Chan films and Hop Sing in the western series &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

==Early life==
Sen Yung was born in San Francisco, California to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China. When his mother died during the flu epidemic of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children&#x27;s shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. He returned in 1922 with his new wife, Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children.

==Career==
===Charlie Chan films and military service===
Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film &quot;Charlie Chan in Honolulu&quot;, as the Chinese detective&#x27;s &quot;number two son&quot;, Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland&#x27;s &quot;number one son&quot; Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Luke left the series in 1938, leading to the need for a &quot;number two son&quot;. Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 11 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. Sen Yung played the character of Jimmy Chan very much as Luke played Lee Chan, namely as the bumbling, Americanized son who constantly hinders his father&#x27;s work. The cultural clash between Chan &quot;père&quot;, a Chinese immigrant whose values were fundamentally those of China as expressed in his amusing pseudo-Confucian aphorisms vs. his well meaning, but inept Americanized sons gave the series much of its appeal, together with the fact that for all of Charlie Chan&#x27;s putdowns of his sons there was a genuine paternal love and warmth being expressed. 

Moonlighting from the popular Chan series, Sen Yung won critical acclaim playing the nuanced role of Ong Chi Seng, a young attorney assisting Howard Joyce (played by James Stephenson), defending Leslie Crosbie (played by Bette Davis), accused of murder in the classic Warner Bros. film noir melodrama, &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), directed by William Wyler. In common with other Chinese-American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film &quot;Across the Pacific&quot;.

During World War II he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces just as his erstwhile co-star Sidney Toler was set to revive the dormant Charlie Chan series at Monogram Pictures. According to author James L. Neibaur, Sen Yung&#x27;s military obligations forced him to decline rejoining the series immediately, but Monogram gave him a standing invitation to work there when his tour of duty was up. He was temporarily replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played &quot;number three son&quot; Tommy Chan (and once by Keye Luke&#x27;s real-life brother, Edwin Luke, as &quot;number four son&quot; Eddie Chan). Sen Yung&#x27;s military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces&#x27; play and film &quot;Winged Victory&quot;.
In 1946 Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career at Monogram, now billed as Victor Sen Young and reunited with Sidney Toler. Toler&#x27;s health was failing; Monogram was conserving Toler&#x27;s waning energy, limiting his scenes and giving him long rest periods during filming. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram entrusted much of the action to Victor Sen Young; he and either Mantan Moreland or Willie Best shared much of the footage in Toler&#x27;s final three films, &quot;Dangerous Money&quot;, &quot;Shadows Over Chinatown&quot;, and &quot;The Trap&quot;. The addition of Moreland as Chan&#x27;s black chauffeur, Birmingham Brown, reflected the fact that by this time the Chan pictures had a significant following among black Americans, who liked a film series that for once did not feature a white hero. Moreland&#x27;s popularity in the Chan pictures was so great that he was booked for a nationwide vaudeville tour, forcing him to be replaced in &quot;Dangerous Money&quot; by Willie Best.

Following Toler&#x27;s death in 1947, Victor Sen Young appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features. His character &quot;Jimmy&quot; was renamed &quot;Tommy&quot; (author Scott MacGillivray contends that &quot;Jimmy&quot; was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him, resulting in Monogram making the change). 

===&quot;Bonanza&quot;===
Arguably even more than for his work in the Charlie Chan films, Victor Sen Yung is well remembered as &quot;Hop Sing,&quot; the irascible cook and general factotum on the iconic television series &quot;Bonanza&quot;, appearing in 107 episodes between 1959 and 1973.
&quot;Bonanza&quot; series creator David Dortort told the Archive of American Television that the &quot;Hop Sing&quot; character generated massive fandom - &quot;Victor was just absolutely delightful. He loved the part; he loved doing it. In fact, he began to develop fans, to the extent that I wrote him in as the featured part in a number of shows.”

===Other roles===
Victor Sen Young had roles in numerous motion pictures and television series, ranging from featured players (affable or earnest Asian characters) to bit roles (clerks, houseboys, waiters, etc.). He was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner &quot;Quong Kee&quot; in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, &quot;Quong Kee&quot;, of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham.

In &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (1957-62), Victor Sen Yung had a recurring role as the scheming &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;, a character that Asian rights activist Guy Aoki commends as &quot;a slick, Americanized character. I thought it was great that way back in the ’50s, audiences saw a Chinese American who acted just like anyone else.&quot; 

In the early 1970s, Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk, also in the Old West.

==Skilled chef==
Sen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored &quot;The Great Wok Cookbook&quot; in 1974.

==Plane hijacking==
In 1972, Sen Young was on Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 710, which was hijacked. The FBI stormed the plane, and in the ensuing gunfire Sen Young was shot in the lower back. He and another wounded passenger survived, but a third passenger and the two hijackers were killed.

In 1975, he appeared on Garry Moore&#x27;s &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; and related the events of the hijacking. With Sen Young dressed in a sportcoat and flanked by two dissimilar imposters, none of the four panelists chose him as the character actor.

==Death and legacy==

Victor Sen Young died in his North Hollywood home in 1980, aged 65. The actor, who ran a small mail-order Chinese pottery business, was creating clayware and curing the items with an oven, and died of natural gas poisoning from a gas leak. His body was found November 9, but he had reportedly been dead at least ten days, from possibly around October 31.

Some reports suggested that he was murdered, but police ultimately ruled the death accidental. The eulogy at his funeral was given by fellow &quot;Bonanza&quot; actor Pernell Roberts, who also paid the funeral expenses. He is buried at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

The Victor Sen Young memorial scholarship is awarded each year by the Chinese Alumni Association of the University of California, Berkeley, where Sen Young majored in animal husbandry.

<doc id="1166380" wikidata="Q1007898" url="?curid=1166380" title="Isthmus of Chignecto">
<text>The Isthmus of Chignecto is an isthmus bordering the Maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia that connects the Nova Scotia peninsula with North America.

The isthmus separates the waters of Chignecto Bay, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy, from those of Baie Verte, a sub-basin of the Northumberland Strait that is an arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The isthmus stretches from its northerly point at an area in the Petitcodiac River valley near the city of Dieppe, New Brunswick to its southerly point at an area near the town of Amherst, Nova Scotia. At its narrowest point between Amherst and Tidnish, the isthmus measures wide. Because of its strategic position, it has been important to competing forces through much of its history of occupation.

The name &quot;Chignecto&quot; derives from the Mi&#x27;kmaq name &quot;Siknikt&quot;, meaning &quot;drainage place&quot;; the name of the Mi&#x27;kmaq District where the isthmus is located.

==Geography==

The majority of the lands comprising the isthmus have low elevation above sea level; a large portion comprises the Tantramar Marshes, as well as tidal rivers, mud flats, inland freshwater marshes, coastal saltwater marshes, and mixed forest. Several prominent ridges rise above the surrounding low land and marshes along the Bay of Fundy shore, namely the Fort Lawrence Ridge (in Nova Scotia), the Aulac Ridge, the Sackville Ridge, and the Memramcook Ridge (in New Brunswick).

In contrast to the Bay of Fundy shoreline in the west, the Northumberland Strait shoreline in the east is largely forested, with serpentine tidal estuaries such as the Tidnish River penetrating inland. The narrowest point on the Northumberland shoreline is opposite the Cumberland Basin at Baie Verte. If sea levels were to rise by 12 metres (40 feet), the isthmus would be flooded, effectively making mainland Nova Scotia an island.

== Transportation ==
As the Isthmus of Chignecto was a key surface transportation route since the 17th century, French and later British colonists built military roads across it to the Tantramar Marshes and along the strategic ridges.

In 1872, the Intercolonial Railway of Canada constructed a mainline between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick across the southern portion of the isthmus. It skirted the edge of the Bay of Fundy while crossing the Tantramar Marshes between Amherst, Nova Scotia and Sackville, New Brunswick.

In 1886 a railway line was built from Sackville across the isthmus to Port Elgin and on to Cape Tormentine. The latter was a port for the iceboat service. In 1917 Canadian National Railways established a rail ferry service to Prince Edward Island to connect with the Prince Edward Island Railway.

In the mid-1880s, the isthmus was also the site of one of Canada&#x27;s earliest mega-projects: construction of a broad-gauge railway from the port of Amherst to the Northumberland Strait at Tidnish for carrying small cargo and passenger ships. This ship railway was never successfully operational, and construction was abandoned shortly before completion.

In the 1950s, while construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway was underway, a group of industrialists and politicians from the Maritimes called for a Chignecto Canal to be built as a shortcut for ocean-going ships travelling between Saint John and U.S. ports to the Great Lakes to avoid travelling around Nova Scotia. The project, while endorsed by both the second Flemming government of New Brunswick and the Robichaud government that succeeded it, never progressed beyond the survey stage.

In the early 1960s, the Trans-Canada Highway was built on the isthmus to connect with Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Route 2 in New Brunswick and Highway 104 in Nova Scotia were built parallel to the existing Canadian National Railway trackage; this inter-provincial highway was upgraded to a 4-lane expressway in the 1990s. Route 16 in New Brunswick was built from an interchange with Route 2 in Aulac to the ferry terminal at Cape Tormentine. This was subsequently modified in 1997 to connect with the Confederation Bridge at Cape Jourimain.

== Flooding ==
The Isthmus is at risk of flooding if the dikes holding back the ocean were to fail. As of right now the dikes are venerable to 50 year storms, and this will only get worse due to climate change and erosion Plans have been made to protect the isthmus, with the Canadian government offering to pay half of the 650 million dollar cost to reinforce the dikes. This offer required the provincial governments of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia being required to pay 162.5 million dollars Nova Scotia and New Brunswick claimed the federal government should pay the full cost and have taken the issue to court.

The issue stems from the debate as to whether the project is of national importance, or disaster mitigation and adaptation. If the project is disaster mitigation and adaptation the maximum the federal government can pay is half the cost, but if the project is of national importance the federal government pays all. Furthermore, the federal government paid the entire cost of the 4 billion dollar Champlain Bridge in Montreal.

==History==
The first European settlements on the isthmus were French. The isthmus was the location of a growing Acadian farming community called Beaubassin. The isthmus became in 1713 the site of the historic dividing line between the British colony of Nova Scotia and the French territory. French military forces established Fort Beauséjour on the Aulac Ridge in 1749 in response to the British construction of an outpost called Fort Lawrence on the ridge immediately to the east.

Between the two ridges was a tidal stream called the Missaquash River, which France generally accepted to be the boundary between the territories. The powers had never determined and agreed to an official boundary. France also constructed Fort Gaspereau on the shores of the Northumberland Strait to effectively control travel on the isthmus.

=== King William&#x27;s War ===
; Raid on Chignecto (1696)

During King William&#x27;s War, the first of the four French and Indian Wars, the English colonial militia leader Benjamin Church led a devastating raid on the Isthmus of Chignecto at Beaubassin, in retaliation for an earlier French and native raid against Pemaquid, Maine (present day Bristol, Maine) earlier that year. Church and four hundred men (50 to 150 of whom were Indians, likely Iroquois) arrived offshore of Beaubassin on September 20. They managed to get ashore and surprise the Acadians. Many fled while one confronted Church with papers showing they had signed an oath of allegiance in 1690 to the English king.

Church was unconvinced. He burned a number of buildings, killed inhabitants, looted their household goods, and slaughtered their livestock. Governor Villebon reported that 
the English stayed at Beaubassin nine whole days without drawing any supplies from their vessels, and even those settlers to whom they had shown a pretence of mercy were left with empty houses and barns and nothing else except the clothes on their backs.

=== Queen Anne&#x27;s War ===

; Raid on Chignecto (1704)
Major Church returned to Acadia during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in retaliation for the French and their Abenaki allies&#x27; sorties during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) and the Raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts. They killed many English colonists at Deerfield and took more than 100 captive. The captives were mostly women and children; they were forced on an overland march from western Massachusetts to Montreal. Some were held by the Indians for ransom, as raiding was active on both sides. Others were adopted by Mohawk families at the Catholic village south of the French city. Some adults, such as the minister of Deerfield, were redeemed by their communities or families paying ransom, but the process sometimes took years. His daughter Emily, adopted when a young teenager, never returned to live with her English family, as she married a Mohawk man and had a family with him.

On July 17, 1704 Church raided Chignecto. The Acadian settlers returned some gunfire but quickly sought shelter in the woods. Church burned 40 empty houses and killed more than 200 cattle and other livestock.

On this campaign against Acadia, Church also raided Castine, Maine, Grand Pré, and Pisiguit (present-day Windsor/Falmouth).

The British took control of present-day mainland Nova Scotia under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), and Beaubassin became part of British territory.

=== King George&#x27;s War ===
During King George&#x27;s War, the French used Chignecto as the staging area for their raids on British Nova Scotia. It was the gathering place for De Ramezay prior to the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744). Chignecto was also the base of Nicolas Antoine II Coulon de Villiers prior to the Battle of Grand Pre (1747).

=== Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War ===

; Battle at Chignecto (1749)
During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, conflict in Acadia continued. On September 18, 1749, several Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet killed three Englishmen at Chignecto. Seven natives were also killed in the skirmish.

; Battle at Chignecto (1750)

In May 1750, Lawrence was unsuccessful in getting a base at Chignecto because Le Loutre burned the village of Beaubassin, preventing Lawrence from using its supplies to establish a fort. (According to the historian Frank Patterson, the Acadians at Cobequid also burned their homes as they retreated from the British to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia in 1754.) Lawrence retreated, but he returned in September 1750.

On September 3, Rous, Lawrence and Gorham led over 700 men to Chignecto, where Mi’kmaq and Acadians opposed their landing. They killed twenty British, who in turn killed several Mi’kmaq. Le Loutre&#x27;s militia eventually withdrew, burning the rest of the Acadians&#x27; crops and houses as they went. Le Loutre and the Acadian militia leader Joseph Broussard resisted the British assault. The British troops defeated the resistance and began construction of Fort Lawrence near the site of the ruins of Beaubassin. The work on the fort proceeded rapidly and they completed the facility within weeks. To limit the British to peninsular Nova Scotia, the French also began to fortify the Chignecto and its approaches; they constructed Fort Beauséjour and two satellite forts: one at present-day Strait Shores, New Brunswick (Fort Gaspareaux) and the other at present-day Saint John, New Brunswick (Fort Menagoueche).

During these months, 35 Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians ambushed Ranger Captain Francis Bartelo, killing him and six of his men while taking seven others captive. The Mi&#x27;kmaq conducted ritual torture of the captives throughout the night, which had a chilling effect on the New Englanders.

; Raid on Chignecto (1751)
The British retaliated for the Raid on Dartmouth (1751) by sending several armed companies to Chignecto. They killed a few French defenders and breached the dikes, allowing the low lands to flood. Hundreds of acres of crops were ruined, which was disastrous for the Acadians and the French troops. In the summer of 1752, Father Le Loutre went to Quebec and then on to France to raise funds and supplies to re-build the dikes. He returned in the spring of 1753.

In May 1753, Natives scalped two British soldiers at Fort Lawrence.

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===

; Battle of Fort Beauséjour (1755)
A British fleet of three warships and thirty-three transports, carrying 2,100 soldiers from Boston, Massachusetts, landed at Fort Lawrence on June 3, 1755. They attacked Fort Beauséjour the following day. The French forces abandoned Fort Gaspareaux on June 16, 1755, choosing instead to re-garrison at Fortress Louisbourg. This battle proved to be one of the key victories for the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which Great Britain gained control of all of New France and Acadia.

On the isthmus, the British abandoned Fort Lawrence and took over the better-constructed Fort Beauséjour, which they renamed Fort Cumberland. Shortly afterwards, the Great Upheaval began when British forces started rounding up French settlers during the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). Most of these settlers would be deported, with their villages burned behind them to prevent their return.

; Skirmish at Chignecto (1755 July)
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, at Fort Moncton (formerly Fort Gaspareaux), one of Captain Silvaus Cobb&#x27;s soldiers was shot from his horse and killed in an ambush. Cobb assembled 100 troops but was unable to catch the Mi’kmaq. Monckton dispatched 200 men from Fort Lawrence but was also unsuccessful in catching any Mi’kmaq.

; Raid on Chignecto (1755 September)

On September 15, Majors Jedidiah Preble and Benjamin Coldthwait took 400 men to destroy an Acadian village a short distance outside of Fort Monckton.

; Raid on Chignecto (1756 January)

On January 20, Boishébert sent François Boucher de Niverville to Baie Verte to burn a British schooner. Niverville killed seven soldiers and took one prisoner before burning the ship. Meanwhile, Boishébert and his 120 Acadians and Mi’kmaq tried to set up a siege of Fort Cumberland, but ended up escaping capture in a possible ambush.

; Raid on Chignecto (1756 April)
The Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians attacked Fort Cumberland on April 26, 1756. During the following two days, nine British soldiers were killed and scalped.

; Raid on Chignecto (1756 October)
When Boishébert moved against Fort Monckton, the British abandoned it and burned it to the ground so that it could not be used by the French.

; Skirmish at Chignecto (1757 July)
On July 20, 1757, Mi’kmaq captured two of Gorham&#x27;s rangers outside Fort Cumberland.

; Skirmish at Chignecto (1757 September)
On September 6, Monckton directed Lt. Colonel Hunt Walsh to take the 28th regiment and a company of rangers to Baie Verte to burn what was left of it. When they arrived, it was already vacated.

==== Yorkshire emigration ====
In 1758 Governor Lawrence issued a proclamation inviting New Englanders to come to Nova Scotia, settle on vacated Acadian lands, and take up free land grants. He also extended the invitation to New England soldiers serving in Canada whose enlistments had expired and who were planning on returning home. Such settlers became known as the New England Planters. Following the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763, the British created three 100,000-acre (400 km2) townships on the isthmus: Amherst, Sackville and Cumberland, which would later be dissolved into Cumberland County.

The drive to attract settlers from New England was not immediately successful. After a few small groups arrived in 1760 and 1761, some families returned home, and the British government decided to look elsewhere for settlers. Between 1772 and 1775, more than 20 ships arrived from England, carrying upwards of 1,000 settlers from Yorkshire to the new townships. The descendants of the Yorkshire emigration continue to be prominent in the area&#x27;s development and history.

=== American Revolutionary War ===

;Battle of Fort Cumberland (&quot;Eddy Rebellion&quot;)
In October and November 1776, local guerrilla and colonial American forces led by Jonathan Eddy and John Allan attempted to take over Fort Cumberland and the Tantramar region. Eddy&#x27;s attacking force consisted of &quot;about twenty&quot; Americans from Machias, Maine, 27 Yankee settlers from the Saint John River valley, 140 Malisseet and four Mi&#x27;kmaq, 21 Acadians from the Memramcook Valley and the Allen family farm, and about 120 farmers from Cumberland, Onslow, and Pictou. Eddy had insufficient forces to capture the fort in a direct assault so he besieged the fort instead. Rebel sympathizers from Sackville burned some surrounding buildings. After three weeks, British forces dispatched from Halifax and Windsor routed the invaders.

The British burned eight of the rebel Acadians&#x27; houses and barns at Inverma Farm, Jolicoeur. With winter coming rapidly, the Acadians were forced to relocate with their families to Memramcook. Eddy, Allan and many of the other English-speaking rebels were also expelled from Nova Scotia, but the American colonial government rewarded their efforts with land grants in Maine and Ohio.

<text>White Noise is the eighth novel by Don DeLillo, published by Viking Press in 1985. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.

&quot;White Noise&quot; is a cornerstone example of postmodern literature. It is widely considered DeLillo&#x27;s breakout work and brought him to the attention of a much larger audience. The novel was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s List of the 100 Best Novels. DeLillo originally wanted to call the book &quot;Panasonic&quot;, but the Panasonic Corporation objected.

In late 2022, the novel was adapted by director Noah Baumbach into a film of the same name starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig.

==Plot==

Set in the bucolic college town Blacksmith, &quot;White Noise&quot; follows a year in the life of Jack Gladney, a professor at the College-on-the-Hill who has made his name by pioneering the field of Hitler studies (though he has not taken German lessons until this year). He has been married five times to four women and rears a number of children and stepchildren (Heinrich, Denise, Steffie, Wilder) with his current wife, Babette. Jack and Babette are both extremely afraid of death; they frequently wonder which of them will be the first to die. The first part of &quot;White Noise&quot;, called &quot;Waves and Radiation,&quot; is a chronicle of contemporary family life combined with academic satire.

There is little plot development in this first section, which mainly serves as an introduction to the characters and themes which dominate the rest of the book. For instance, the mysterious deaths of men in &quot;Mylex&quot; (intended to suggest &quot;Mylar&quot;) suits and the ashen, shaken survivors of a plane that went into free fall anticipate the catastrophe of the book&#x27;s second part. &quot;Waves and Radiation&quot; also introduces Murray Jay Siskind, Jack&#x27;s friend and fellow college professor, who discusses theories about death, supermarkets, media, &quot;psychic data&quot;, and other facets of contemporary American culture. Jack and Murray visit the most photographed barn in the world, discussing how its notoriety renders truly seeing the barn an impossibility, and later present an impromptu joint lecture juxtaposing the lives of Hitler and Elvis Presley.

In the second part of the novel, &quot;,&quot; a chemical spill from a rail car releases a black noxious cloud over Jack&#x27;s home region, prompting an evacuation. Frightened by his exposure to the toxin (called Nyodene Derivative), Jack is forced to confront his mortality. An organization called SIMUVAC (short for &quot;simulated evacuation&quot;) is also introduced in part two, an indication of simulations replacing reality.

In part three of the book, &quot;Dylarama&quot;, Jack discovers that Babette has been cheating on him with a man she calls &quot;Mr. Gray&quot; in order to gain access to a fictional drug called Dylar, an experimental treatment for the terror of death. The novel becomes a meditation on modern society&#x27;s fear of death and its obsession with chemical cures as Jack seeks to obtain his own black-market supply of Dylar. However, Dylar does not work for Babette, and it has many possible side effects, including losing the ability to &quot;distinguish words from things, so that if someone said &#x27;speeding bullet,&#x27; I would fall to the floor and take cover.&quot;

Jack continues to obsess over death. During a discussion about mortality, Murray suggests that killing someone could alleviate the fear. Jack decides to track down and kill Mr. Gray, whose real name, he has learned, is Willie Mink. After a black comedy scene of Jack driving and rehearsing, in his head, several ways in which their encounter might proceed, he successfully locates and shoots Willie, who at the time is in a delirious state caused by his own Dylar addiction.

Jack puts the gun in Willie&#x27;s hand to make the murder look like a suicide, but Willie then shoots Jack in the arm. Suddenly realizing the needless loss of life, Jack carries Willie to a hospital run by German nuns who do not believe in God or an afterlife. Having saved Willie, Jack returns home to watch his children sleep.

The final chapter describes Wilder, Jack&#x27;s youngest child, riding a tricycle across the highway and miraculously surviving. Jack, Babette, and Wilder join a crowd gathering to watch the brilliant sunset, possibly enhanced by the airborne toxic event, from an overpass, before Jack describes his avoidance of his doctor and the hypnotic and spiritual nature of the supermarket.

==Structure==
&quot;White Noise&quot; is written in the first person through the eyes of the main character, Jack Gladney. Jack is middle-aged and overly concerns himself with the inevitability of death. The first-person perspective gives the audience the ability to see Jack&#x27;s true thoughts and feelings. The majority of the novel is written in dialogue, primarily focusing on the interactions between the characters and Jack&#x27;s interpretations. Author DeLillo purposefully creates Jack&#x27;s dialogue to be philosophical. The diction is not complex, but rather the sentence structure of Jack&#x27;s dialogue is complex. Jack&#x27;s character&#x27;s dialogue throughout the story provides a better meaning than the other characters&#x27;.

==Setting==
&quot;White Noise&quot; begins in the college town of Blacksmith. The exact geographical setting of &quot;White Noise&quot; is unidentified, but elements of the novel evoke the Midwestern United States, especially the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest. The fictional Iron City shares its name with the Pittsburgh beer company of the same name. Critic John Pistelli wrote that a Midwestern setting was &quot;thematically appropriate to the novel&#x27;s concern with the vanishing of labor and laboring know-how.&quot;

==Characters==

Jack Gladney is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. He is a professor of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in middle America.

Babette is Jack&#x27;s wife. They have seven children from previous marriages, and they are currently living with four of these children. Babette has an affair with Willie Mink, whom she calls Mr. Gray, in order to obtain Dylar.

Heinrich Gerhardt is the fourteen-year-old son of Jack and Janet Savory. He is precociously intellectual, prone to be contrary, and plays correspondence chess with an imprisoned mass murderer.

Denise is the eleven-year-old daughter of Babette and Bob Pardee. She suspects her mother is a drug addict and steals the bottle of Dylar to hide it.

Steffie is the nine-year-old daughter of Jack and Dana Breedlove.

Wilder is Babette&#x27;s two-year-old son, and the youngest child in the family. Wilder is never quoted for dialogue in the novel (however, at one point, it is said that he asked for a glass of milk) and periodically Jack worries about the boy&#x27;s slow linguistic development.

Bee is the twelve-year-old daughter of Jack and Tweedy Browner. She lived in South Korea for two years.

Dana Breedlove is Jack&#x27;s first and fourth wife and the mother of Mary Alice and Steffie. She works part time for the CIA and conducts covert drop-offs in Latin America. She also writes book reviews.

Janet Savory is Jack&#x27;s second wife and the mother of Heinrich. She manages the financial businesses of an ashram in Montana, where she is known as Mother Devi. Before that she worked as a foreign-currency analyst for a secret group of advanced theorists.

Tweedy Browner is Jack&#x27;s third wife and the mother of Bee.

Mary Alice is the nineteen-year-old daughter of Dana Breedlove and Jack&#x27;s first marriage.

Eugene is Babette&#x27;s eight-year-old son who lives with his unnamed father in Western Australia. His father is also Wilder&#x27;s father.

Murray Jay Siskind is a colleague of Jack&#x27;s. He wants to create a field of study centered on Elvis Presley in the same way that Jack has created one around Hitler. He teaches a course on the cinema of car crashes, watches TV obsessively, and cheerfully theorizes about many subjects, including media saturation, mindfulness, and the meaning of supermarkets.

Orest Mercator is Heinrich&#x27;s friend who trains to sit in a cage with vipers.

Vernon Dickey is Babette&#x27;s father who visits the family in chapter 33 and gives Jack a gun.

Willie Mink is a compromised researcher who invents Dylar.

Winnie Richards is a scientist at the college where Jack works, to whom Jack goes for information about Dylar.

==Analysis==

&quot;White Noise&quot; explores several themes that emerged during the mid-to-late twentieth century, e.g., rampant consumerism, media saturation, novelty academic intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and reintegration of the family, human-made disasters, and the potentially regenerative nature of violence. The novel&#x27;s style is characterized by a heterogeneity that utilizes &quot;montages of tones, styles, and voices that have the effect of yoking together terror and wild humor as the essential tone of contemporary America.&quot;

==Themes==

===Death===

A recurring question that Babette and Jack constantly battle is, &quot;Who is going to die first?&quot; Throughout the novel, Jack&#x27;s low self-esteem is noticeable. Jack believes that he is a fraud and he would have no importance in death. He believes his academic career is insignificant. Jack&#x27;s battle with his fear of death is a constant conflict throughout the book. Similarly, Babette also battles death but in a different way. Babette takes Dylar in order to forget about the fear of death, whereas Jack acknowledges what death is and his fear of it. Although the couple&#x27;s fear of death is different, it also permeates their lives and causes them to experience insanity and obsession. In a meta commentary on the role of narrative plot in storytelling, Gladney, and the novel itself, assert that once a plot is set in motion it only moves &quot;deathward&quot;. All courses of action that center around a plan ultimately end in death. The novel illustrates this through Jack&#x27;s crippling fear, and its highly fragmented organization of events and chapters. This fragmentation stagnates the plot compared to the typical novel, and for Jack&#x27;s purposes, keeps death at arm&#x27;s length.

===Academia===
The novel is an example of academic satire, where the shortcomings of academia are ridiculed through irony or sarcasm. Critic Karen Weekes notes that the professors at University-on-the-Hill &quot;fail to inspire respect&quot; from their students and that &quot;the university itself is &#x27;trivialized by the nostalgic study of popular and youth culture by offering classes on Adolf Hitler, Elvis Presley, and cinematic car crashes. Critic Ian Finseth adds how &quot;the academic profession ...[has a] tendency to divide up the world and all human experience.&quot; DeLillo uses Hitler Studies as a way for the characters to deal with complex information, enabling them to cope with the intricacies of their society.

Critic Stephen Schryer goes on to note the satirical way that characters in &quot;White Noise&quot; &quot;lay claim to specialized knowledge that can be transmitted to others, regardless of their educational accomplishments or actual income&quot;. According to Schryer, the characters&#x27; vocations suggest &quot;pseudo-professionalism&quot;, as if each can claim a professional expertise or outstanding intellect that &quot;[renders] this class dependent on hyper-specialized forms of expertise.&quot; Critic David Alworth suggests that characters deal with unknowns like death via the &quot;pseudo-professional&quot;; they respond by pretending that they are educated to understand it.

===Consumer culture===
Ecocritic Cynthia Deitering has described the novel as central to the rise of &quot;toxic consciousness&quot; in American fiction in the 1980s, arguing that the novel &quot;offers insight into a culture&#x27;s shifting relation to nature and to the environment at a time when the imminence of ecological collapse was, and is, part of the public mind and of individual imagination.&quot; Alexander Davis has similarly made the argument that &quot;White Noise&quot; reflects humanity&#x27;s changed relationship to nature as a result of rampant consumerism.

DeLillo critiques modern consumption by connecting identity to shopping in &quot;White Noise&quot;. In a 1993 interview, DeLillo states that there is a &quot;consume or die&quot; mentality in America, which is reflected in the novel. Characters in the novel try to avoid death through shopping. For example, Jack goes on a shopping spree where he is described as feeling more powerful with each purchase: &quot;I traded money for goods. The more money I spent, the less important it seemed. I was bigger than these sums.&quot; Postmodern critic Karen Weekes expands on this idea and argues that Americans &quot;consume and die&quot;; even though Jack tries to avoid death through shopping, he can&#x27;t. Life is represented by shopping and death is represented by checking out at the registers. Critic Ahmad Ghashmari addresses the connection between advertising&#x27;s influence on shoppers and the world in &quot;White Noise&quot; by stating, &quot;Shoppers are attracted to colors, sizes, and the packaging; the surface is what draws and grips their attentions and ignites their desires to buy items regardless of their need for them.&quot; According to Ghashmari, &quot;The supermarket, with its spectacle of goods has effaced reality and replaced it with a hyper reality in which the surfaces replace the real products.&quot; Additionally, critic Ruzbeh Babaee argues that in the novel, &quot;There is a belief in the produced through media advertising, that one can shop his/her way out of any personal trauma. When shopping, people may define an identity, an idea of who they are.&quot; The characters in &quot;White Noise&quot; shop in order to create their own identity and escape the fear of death. On the topic of consumerism, DeLillo himself states that &quot;through products and advertising people attain an impersonal identity&quot;. In other words, because shoppers all buy the same products, they can&#x27;t be unique.

Through the theme of technology, DeLillo demonstrates the effect media has on human behavior. Most critics agree that &quot;White Noise&quot; functions as a cautionary tale about high-tech America by focusing on the effects of technology on social relations. Critic Ahmad Ghashmari says, &quot;TV is as important and influential as the protagonist of the novel... TV seems to control all people; they believe nothing but TV.&quot; He points to chapter 6 of the novel, explaining, &quot;Heinrich refuses to trust his senses in observing the weather and chooses to believe the radio instead. He believes that all what is broadcast on the radio is true.&quot; One critic adds that television does not stop at molding the thoughts of DeLillo&#x27;s characters, but more invasively, television and its advertising subliminally shape their unconscious behavior. For example, in chapter 21, Jack witnesses television&#x27;s influence when he observes his daughter uttering &quot;Toyota Celica&quot; in her sleep. DeLillo has said that &quot;there&#x27;s a connection between the advances that are made in technology and the sense of primitive fear people develop in response to it.&quot; Critic John Frow connects the theme of technology to the greater postmodern theoretical issues the book addresses. He suggests that a second televised narrative is embedded within the narrative of the novel&#x27;s plot through constant references to television&#x27;s interjections. The world of &quot;White Noise&quot; is so saturated by television shows and other media messages that &quot;it becomes increasingly difficult to separate primary actions from imitations of actions&quot;. Thoughts and actions are replaced by programmed responses, which have been learned.

Indeed, it is a world that seems determined by simulation which, according to Jean Baudrillard, is &quot;the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal&quot;. This is illustrated, in the eyes of Haidar Eid of Rand Afrikaans University, by much of the imagery used to convey the incomprehensible reality of the Toxic Cloud and is explicitly thematized through Jack&#x27;s conversation with the intake clerk from SIMUVAC which concludes Part 2 of the novel. Here Jack is told that even though the evacuation taking place is real, the SIMUVAC team is treating it &quot;as a model&quot; to be used to perfect the protocol they will use in future disaster simulations. In effect, the reality of &quot;The Airborne Toxic Event&quot; has been displaced by their performance in something like street theater. Such an ironic reversal of reader expectations is reinforced when the Simuvac Man further acknowledges that using &quot;the real event in order to rehearse the simulation&quot; has inherent difficulties and that &quot;You have to make allowances for the fact that everything we see tonight is real.&quot; In Baudrillard&#x27;s words, &quot;It is no longer a question of imitation, nor of reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather a question of substituting signs of the real for the real itself.&quot; That is why the Simuvac Man concludes his remarks by conceding that &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of polishing we still have to do. But that&#x27;s what this exercise is all about.&quot; Such a substitution of the sign for the reality is what Baudrillard calls a &quot;simulacrum&quot;, and in &quot;White Noise&quot; this is emblematically represented by &quot;the most photographed barn in America&quot; which, according to Peter Knight, &quot;has perhaps become the &#x27;Most Discussed Scene in Postmodern Fiction&#x27;.&quot; Such a postmodern understanding is expressed by Murray when he declares that &quot;No one sees the barn,&quot; for &quot;Once you&#x27;ve seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.&quot; Created by photography and tourism, the barn is &quot;a packaged perception, a &#x27;sight&#x27;...not a &#x27;thing&#x27;.&quot; Because as Murray explains &quot;we&#x27;ve read the signs, seen the people snapping the pictures,&quot; the barn is a cultural reality which has what Delillo calls an &quot;aura&quot;. This aura, says Murray, prevents us from even speculating about what the &quot;original&quot; barn might have really been like because &quot;We can&#x27;t get outside the aura,&quot; and every photograph taken by the tourists only &quot;reinforces the aura&quot; of the barn. According to Frank Lentricchia, this loss of the referent, the dissolving of the object into its representations, lends the passage the status of a &quot;primal scene&quot;, but one which is for Murray an occasion for celebration because it is a &quot;technological transcendence&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re part of the aura. We&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re now.&quot;

===Childhood===
DeLillo also portrays the children as being smarter and more mature than the adults in &quot;White Noise&quot;. In a 1985 book review of the novel by Jayne Anne Phillips from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Phillips says &quot;Children, in the America of &quot;White Noise&quot;, are in general, more competent, more watchful, more in sync than their parents.&quot; These children have the composure normally expected of an adult, yet the parents have a constant sense of self-doubt that makes them appear immature and paranoid. A scholar from University of Washington, Tom Leclaire, adds to the argument by saying that children are the center of knowledge: &quot;Gladney&#x27;s children are making his family a center of learning.&quot; However, Joshua Little, of Georgia State University, provides a different point of view that &quot;the possibility of transcendence through the innocence of children is hinted at in the novel&quot;. According to Little, in the context of the turn of the century, knowledge is connected to having a higher social standing. Adina Baya, a specialist in media communication, supports this idea as she points out that children during the 1980s had greater access to mass media and marketing than before.

===Religion===
DeLillo interprets religion in &quot;White Noise&quot; unconventionally, most notably drawing comparisons between Jack&#x27;s local supermarket and a religious institution on several occasions. Critic Karen Weekes argues that religion in &quot;White Noise&quot; has &quot;lost its quality&quot; and that it is a &quot;devaluation&quot; of traditional belief in a superhuman power. According to critic Tim Engles, DeLillo portrays protagonist Jack Gladney as &quot;formulating his own prayers and seeking no solace from higher authority&quot;. In addition, in the places the reader would expect to see religion, it is absent. Novelist and critic Joshua Ferris points out that &quot;in a town like Blacksmith, the small midwestern university town of &quot;White Noise&quot;, the rites and rituals of traditional religion, such as church, bible study, and signs for Jesus, are expected&quot;. However, God is largely absent in this suburb. He adds, &quot;The absence of religion is obvious, and places the novel in an entirely non-spiritual, post-Christian world. In &quot;White Noise&quot;, not even Catholic nuns believe in God.&quot; However, Professor Majeed Jadwe countered with, &quot;&quot;White Noise&quot; begins and ends with a ritual. The first is the convoy of station wagons arriving for the new school year, which Jack describes as an event which he has not missed in 21 years. It ends with the public ritual of self-hood perfection.&quot; Professor Jadwe implies that although religion is not presented in the book, the concept of ritual is still present. The society portrayed in White Noise utilizes ritual in other areas such as Jack never missing the convoy. The world of &quot;White Noise&quot; is still obsessed with ritual despite the absence of religion. Associate Director of Language and Writing, Christopher S. Glover, agreed by stating, &quot;Just after the nun tells Jack that there exists nothing worth believing in and that anyone who does believe in something is a fool, DeLillo dangles this event in front of us, daring us to believe in something—anything—by using religious buzzwords such as &#x27;mystical,&#x27; &#x27;exalted,&#x27; and &#x27;profound&#x27; but countering those words with others like &#x27;lame-brained.&#x27;&quot; DeLillo has stated that paranoia operates as a form of religious awe in his characters. He added that &quot;[paranoia] is something old, a leftover from some forgotten part of the soul. And the intelligence agencies that create and service this paranoia are not interesting to me as spy handlers or masters of espionage. They represent old mysteries and fascinations, ineffable things. Central intelligence. They&#x27;re like churches that hold the final secrets.&quot; Don DeLillo claims &quot;Religion has not been a major element in my work, and for some years now I think the true American religion has been &#x27;the American People.&#x27;&quot;

==Cultural references==

The band The Airborne Toxic Event took their name from the novel.

Interpol released a single, &quot;The Heinrich Maneuver,&quot; the title of which is an apparent reference to Jack&#x27;s son.

The 2023 Ohio train derailment has been compared to the events of the second half of the novel. Coincidentally, the train crash scene in the 2022 film adaptation of the book was filmed in East Palestine, where the train derailment occurred, and several of the evacuees had worked as extras in the film.

==Film adaptation==

The rights to film the novel were first acquired by HBO, and later by James L. Brooks&#x27;s Gracie Films, and then again in 1999 by Sonnenfeld/Josephson with Barry Sonnenfeld set to direct, but the option lapsed. In 2016, Uri Singer acquired the rights and pushed the project into development.

In 2021, it was announced that Noah Baumbach would write and direct the film for Netflix, starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig.

<doc id="1166387" wikidata="Q1326528" url="?curid=1166387" title="Electroreception and electrogenesis">
<text>Electroreception and electrogenesis are the closely related biological abilities to perceive electrical stimuli and to generate electric fields. Both are used to locate prey; stronger electric discharges are used in a few groups of fishes (most famously the electric eel, which is not actually an eel but a knifefish) to stun prey. The capabilities are found almost exclusively in aquatic or amphibious animals, since water is a much better conductor of electricity than air. In passive electrolocation, objects such as prey are detected by sensing the electric fields they create. In active electrolocation, fish generate a weak electric field and sense the different distortions of that field created by objects that conduct or resist electricity. Active electrolocation is practised by two groups of weakly electric fish, the Gymnotiformes (knifefishes) and the Mormyridae (elephantfishes), and by &quot;Gymnarchus niloticus&quot;, the African knifefish. An electric fish generates an electric field using an electric organ, modified from muscles in its tail. The field is called weak if it is only enough to detect prey, and strong if it is powerful enough to stun or kill. The field may be in brief pulses, as in the elephantfishes, or a continuous wave, as in the knifefishes. Some strongly electric fish, such as the electric eel, locate prey by generating a weak electric field, and then discharge their electric organs strongly to stun the prey; other strongly electric fish, such as the electric ray, electrolocate passively. The stargazers are unique in being strongly electric but not using electrolocation.

The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini evolved early in the history of the vertebrates; they are found in both cartilaginous fishes such as sharks, and in bony fishes such as coelacanths and sturgeons, and must therefore be ancient. Most bony fishes have secondarily lost their ampullae of Lorenzini, but other non-homologous electroreceptors have repeatedly evolved, including in two groups of mammals, the monotremes (platypus and echidnas) and the cetaceans (Guiana dolphin).

== History == 

In 1678, while doing dissections of sharks, the Italian physician Stefano Lorenzini discovered organs on their heads now called ampullae of Lorenzini. He published his findings in &quot;Osservazioni intorno alle torpedini&quot;. The electroreceptive function of these organs was established by R. W. Murray in 1960.

In 1921, the German anatomist Viktor Franz described the knollenorgans (tuberous organs) in the skin of the elephantfishes, again without knowledge of their function as electroreceptors.

In 1949, the Ukrainian-British zoologist Hans Lissmann noticed that the African knife fish (&quot;Gymnarchus niloticus&quot;) was able to swim backwards at the same speed and with the same dexterity around obstacles as when it swam forwards, avoiding collisions. He demonstrated in 1950 that the fish was producing a variable electric field, and that the fish reacted to any change in the electric field around it.&#x27;

== Electrolocation ==

Electroreceptive animals use the sense to locate objects around them. This is important in ecological niches where the animal cannot depend on vision: for example in caves, in murky water, and at night. Electrolocation can be passive, sensing electric fields such as those generated by the muscle movements of buried prey, or active, the electrogenic predator generating a weak electric field to allow it to distinguish between conducting and non-conducting objects in its vicinity.

=== Passive electrolocation ===

In passive electrolocation, the animal senses the weak bioelectric fields generated by other animals and uses it to locate them. These electric fields are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles. A second source of electric fields in fish is the ion pump associated with osmoregulation at the gill membrane. This field is modulated by the opening and closing of the mouth and gill slits.
Passive electroreception usually relies upon ampullary receptors such as ampullae of Lorenzini which are sensitive to low frequency stimuli, below 50 Hz. These receptors have a jelly-filled canal leading from the sensory receptors to the skin surface.

=== Active electrolocation ===

In active electrolocation, the animal senses its surrounding environment by generating weak electric fields (electrogenesis) and detecting distortions in these fields using electroreceptor organs. This electric field is generated by means of a specialised electric organ consisting of modified muscle or nerves. Animals that use active electroreception include the weakly electric fish, which either generate small electrical pulses (termed &quot;pulse-type&quot;), as in the Mormyridae, or produce a quasi-sinusoidal discharge from the electric organ (termed &quot;wave-type&quot;), as in the Gymnotidae.

Many of these fish, such as &quot;Gymnarchus&quot; and &quot;Apteronotus&quot;, keep their body rather rigid, swimming forwards or backwards with equal facility by undulating fins that extend most of the length of their bodies. Swimming backwards may help them to search for and assess prey using electrosensory cues. Experiments by Lannoo and Lannoo in 1993 support Lissmann&#x27;s proposal that this style of swimming with a straight back works effectively given the constraints of active electrolocation. &quot;Apteronotus&quot; can select and catch larger &quot;Daphnia&quot; water fleas among smaller ones, and they do not discriminate against artificially-darkened water fleas, in both cases with or without light.

These fish create a potential usually smaller than one volt (1 V). Weakly electric fish can discriminate between objects with different resistance and capacitance values, which may help in identifying objects. Active electroreception typically has a range of about one body length, though objects with an electrical impedance similar to that of the surrounding water are nearly undetectable.

Active electrolocation relies upon tuberous electroreceptors which are sensitive to high frequency (20-20,000 Hz) stimuli. These receptors have a loose plug of epithelial cells which capacitively couples the sensory receptor cells to the external environment. Elephantfish (Mormyridae) from Africa have tuberous electroreceptors known as Knollenorgans and Mormyromasts in their skin.

Elephantfish emit short pulses to locate their prey. Capacitative and resistive objects affect the electric field differently, enabling the fish to locate objects of different types within a distance of about a body length. Resistive objects increase the amplitude of the pulse; capacitative objects introduce distortions.

The Gymnotiformes, including the glass knifefish (Sternopygidae) and the electric eel (Gymnotidae), differ from the Mormyridae in emitting a continuous wave, approximating a sine wave, from their electric organ. As in the Mormyridae, the generated electric field enables them to discriminate accurately between capacitative and resistive objects.

== Electrocommunication ==

Weakly electric fish can communicate by modulating the electrical waveform they generate. They may use this to attract mates and in territorial displays. Electric catfish frequently use their electric discharges to ward off other species from their shelter sites, whereas with their own species they have ritualized fights with open-mouth displays and sometimes bites, but rarely use electric organ discharges.

When two glass knifefishes (Sternopygidae) come close together, both individuals shift their discharge frequencies in a jamming avoidance response.

In bluntnose knifefishes, &quot;Brachyhypopomus&quot;, the electric discharge pattern is similar to the low voltage electrolocative discharge of the electric eel, &quot;Electrophorus&quot;. This is hypothesized to be Batesian mimicry of the powerfully-protected electric eel. &quot;Brachyhypopomus&quot; males produce a continuous electric &quot;hum&quot; to attract females; this consumes 11–22% of their total energy budget, whereas female electrocommunication consumes only 3%. Large males produced signals of larger amplitude, and these are preferred by the females. The cost to males is reduced by a circadian rhythm, with more activity coinciding with night-time courtship and spawning, and less at other times.

Fish that prey on electrolocating fish may &quot;eavesdrop&quot; on the discharges of their prey to detect them. The electroreceptive African sharptooth catfish (&quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot;) may hunt the weakly electric mormyrid, &quot;Marcusenius macrolepidotus&quot; in this way. This has driven the prey, in an evolutionary arms race, to develop more complex or higher frequency signals that are harder to detect.

Some shark embryos and pups &quot;freeze&quot; when they detect the characteristic electric signal of their predators.

== Evolution and taxonomic distribution ==

In vertebrates, passive electroreception is an ancestral trait, meaning that it was present in their last common ancestor. The ancestral mechanism is called ampullary electroreception, from the name of the receptive organs involved, ampullae of Lorenzini. These evolved from the mechanical sensors of the lateral line, and exist in cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, paddlefishes, aquatic salamanders, and caecilians. Ampullae of Lorenzini appear to have been lost early in the evolution of bony fishes and tetrapods, though the evidence for absence in many groups is incomplete and unsatisfactory. Where electroreception does occur in these groups, it has secondarily been acquired in evolution, using organs other than and not homologous with ampullae of Lorenzini.

Electric organs have evolved at least eight separate times, each one forming a clade: twice during the evolution of cartilaginous fishes, creating the electric skates and rays, and six times during the evolution of the bony fishes. Passively-electrolocating groups, including those that move their heads to direct their electroreceptors, are shown without symbols. Non-electrolocating species are not shown. Actively electrolocating fish are marked with a small yellow lightning flash and their characteristic discharge waveforms. Fish able to deliver electric shocks are marked with a red lightning flash .

=== Cartilaginous fish ===

Sharks and rays (&quot;Elasmobranchii&quot;) rely on electrolocation using their ampullae of Lorenzini in the final stages of their attacks, as can be demonstrated by the robust feeding response elicited by electric fields similar to those of their prey. Sharks are the most electrically sensitive animals known, responding to direct current fields as low as 5 nV/cm.

=== Bony fish ===

Two groups of teleost fishes are weakly electric and actively electroreceptive: the Neotropical knifefishes (Gymnotiformes) and the African elephantfishes (Notopteroidei), enabling them to navigate and find food in turbid water. The Gymnotiformes include the electric eel, which besides the group&#x27;s use of low-voltage electrolocation, is able to generate high voltage electric shocks to stun its prey. Such powerful electrogenesis makes use of large electric organs modified from muscles. These consist of a stack of electrocytes, each capable of generating a small voltage; the voltages are effectively added together (in series) to provide a powerful electric organ discharge.

=== Monotremes ===

The monotremes, including the semi-aquatic platypus and the terrestrial echidnas, are one of the only groups of mammals that have evolved electroreception. While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves. The electroreceptors of monotremes consist of free nerve endings located in the mucous glands of the snout. Among the monotremes, the platypus (&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;) has the most acute electric sense. The platypus localises its prey using almost 40,000 electroreceptors arranged in front-to-back stripes along the bill. The arrangement is highly directional, being most sensitive off to the sides and below. By making short quick head movements called saccades, platypuses accurately locate their prey. The platypus appears to use electroreception along with pressure sensors to determine the distance to prey from the delay between the arrival of electrical signals and pressure changes in water.

The electroreceptive capabilities of the four species of echidna are much simpler. Long-beaked echidnas (genus &quot;Zaglossus&quot;) have some 2,000 receptors, while short-beaked echidnas (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) have around 400, near the end of the snout. This difference can be attributed to their habitat and feeding methods. Western long-beaked echidnas feed on earthworms in leaf litter in tropical forests, wet enough to conduct electrical signals well. Short-beaked echidnas feeds mainly on termites and ants, which live in nests in dry areas; the nest interiors are presumably humid enough for electroreception to work. Experiments have shown that echidnas can be trained to respond to weak electric fields in water and moist soil. The electric sense of the echidna is hypothesised to be an evolutionary remnant from a platypus-like ancestor.

=== Dolphins ===

Dolphins have evolved electroreception in structures different from those of fish, amphibians and monotremes. The hairless vibrissal crypts on the rostrum of the Guiana dolphin (&quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot;), originally associated with mammalian whiskers, are capable of electroreception as low as 4.8 μV/cm, sufficient to detect small fish. This is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in the platypus.

=== Bees ===

Until recently, electroreception was known only in vertebrates. Recent research has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers.

<text>Lendlease is an Australian multinational construction and real estate company, headquartered in Barangaroo, New South Wales.

==History==
=== Founding ===
The company was established as Lendlease by Dick Dusseldorp in 1958 to provide finance for building contracts being undertaken by Civil &amp; Civic. In 1961, the company acquired Civil &amp; Civic from Bredero&#x27;s Bouwbedrijf.

Lendlease first listed on the ASX in 1962. Operations expanded to the United States in 1971 and to Singapore in 1973.

In 1982, Lendlease acquired 50% of MLC Life Limited and in 1985 acquired the balance of the company. MLC&#x27;s multi-manager, multi-style investment philosophy was introduced in 1986. It was later sold to National Australia Bank in the year 2000 for $4.56 billion, one of the biggest mergers in Australian corporate history.

=== Expansion and major acquisition ===
In 1999, the company formed Actus Lendlease with the acquisition of Actus Corporation&#x27;s MILCON and technical service construction management business, and augmented this business with professionals from Lendlease Design and Lendlease Development. Around this time, the company also acquired the British-based builder Bovis Construction from P&amp;O. During 2000, it bought Amresco&#x27;s commercial mortgage business. One year later, Lendlease acquired Delfin Property Group (now Lendlease Communities) in exchange for $172 million. It went on to buy Crosby Homes (now Lendlease Residential Development) for circa £240 million in 2005.

=== Barangaroo, Valemus Acquisition, One Lendlease Era ===
In 2009, Steve McCann was appointed CEO. In the same year Lendlease Corporation acquired Babcock and Brown Communities, rebranding the business as Lendlease Primelife. At the time, this acquisition made Lendlease Australia&#x27;s largest provider of retirement villages.

In December 2009, Lendlease was selected by the New South Wales Government to develop Barangaroo.

In 2010, Lendlease announced their first foray into the consumer market with Lendlease Solar. This subsidiary was wound up in early 2011, with no explanation as to why the division had closed.

On 17 February 2011 Lendlease announced wider ranging changes to its group of brands. This announcement meant the retirement of the Bovis, Delfin, Vivas, Catalyst and Primelife brands which were superseded by the unified Lendlease brand.

In late February 2011, Lendlease acquired DASCO in order to position itself to take advantage of the impending Obama administration Health sector boom. The company was immediately rebranded as Lendlease DASCO, and started operating independently of the Lendlease Americas business.

In March 2011, Lendlease completed the acquisition of Valemus (previously known as Bilfinger Berger Australia) from Bilfinger.

In March 2013, the business divested its aged care homes (from the acquisition of Babcock and Brown Communities) to Allity, a business owned by Australian Aged Care Partners.

In 2015, the company rebranded to use &quot;Lendlease&quot; as a single word.

In December 2016, Lendlease formed a joint venture agreement with Energy Made Clean. Energy Made Clean is a wholly owned subsidiary of renewable energy technology developer, Carnegie Clean Energy (ASX: CCE). With EMC and Carnegie&#x27;s joint offerings, it is the only company in the world to offer a combination of wave, solar, wind, storage and desalination via microgrids. Microgrids are a budding industry and this partnership aims to provide end-to-end technologies that deliver energy independence and a reliable alternative to traditional forms of energy in regional, remote and fringe-of-grid locations in Australia, United States and around the world. This asset was later sold in 2020.

In February 2021, Lendlease announced that Tony Lombardo, previously CEO of Lendlease Asia, would takeover from Steve McCann as Group CEO. This took place in June 2021.

The global COVID-19 pandemic led to enforced site closures during the early 2020s, impairing revenues. In February 2022, Lendlease reported a first half loss of $264 million, which it attributed to one-off restructuring costs, COVID-19 issues and asset sales. The company cut about 360 jobs and garnered savings of $160 million. An improved second half to the financial year saw the company post a bottom-line loss of $99 million for the full year, after $333 million in writedowns on existing operations, a 61% drop in development EBITDA to $18 million and a 24% slump in construction earnings to $131 million.

===Australia focus===

In May 2024, Lendlease announced plans to sell its overseas operations and to be focused on its domestic operations in Australia by late 2025. It described its overseas markets as a &quot;drag&quot; on shareholder returns; its new strategy will focus on simplifying the firm&#x27;s structure, reducing costs and leveraging its competitive strengths.

On 1 January 2025, Lendlease announced the sale of its UK construction business to US private equity business Atlas Holdings for £35 million, with completion targeted before the end of June 2025. Once completed, the business is likely to be renamed Bovis, resurrecting a brand retired in 2011.

==Regions==
Lendlease operates across four regional subdivisions:

=== Australia ===
Lendlease&#x27;s regeneration projects include Barangaroo South in Sydney, Docklands, Victoria in Melbourne, the RNA Showgrounds in Brisbane, and Adelaide Oval in Adelaide.

One of Lendlease&#x27;s more controversial communities projects is their development for housing and industry of the former Australian Defence Industries (&#x27;ADI&#x27;) land at St Marys (Ropes Crossing &amp; Jordan Springs) in Western Sydney. Some of the group&#x27;s major communities projects include Springfield Lakes, Queensland. Their ADI property is the largest intact area of the biodiverse and endangered plant community, the &quot;Cumberland Plain Woodland&quot;.

=== Asia ===
Lendlease Asia has been working on two large urban development projects, The Exchange TRX (previously known as TRX Lifestyle Quarter) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Paya Lebar Quarter in Singapore.

===Americas===

Lendlease Project Management &amp; Construction (previously Bovis Lendlease) provided construction management services for the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York, in addition to a number of other major public buildings throughout the U.S. A Public Private Partnership involved InterContinental Hotels Group and Lendlease, where they joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging to deliver quality hotels to United States Army Soldiers, their Families, and official guests of the United States Army. This partnership created IHG Army Hotels, a division of InterContinental Hotels Group. Other urban regeneration projects include Southbank, an area of Chicago, IL.

Soaring Heights, a 6 MW solar development at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona, United States, is a large Public Partnerships business in the US.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, major urban regeneration programmes are underway in Elephant and Castle as Elephant Park, and in Stratford, London as The International Quarter London. Lendlease also worked as project manager on a new township at Durrat Al Bahrain on Bahrain Island.
In Europe, Lendlease Project Management &amp; Construction provide project management and construction services for new projects and programmes. In 2015, Lendlease oversaw the restoration of the encaustic tile pavements at The Houses of Parliament.

==Major projects and operations==

Major construction projects carried out by the company include:
==Controversy and incidents==
In 2008, the company and a subcontractor abatement firm, the John Galt Corporation, were charged with numerous OSHA safety violations after a fire broke out and killed two firefighters at the Deutsche Bank Building, a Manhattan skyscraper being demolished in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The violations included an employee (Safety Manager) of &quot;Lendlease&#x27;s Project Management &amp; Construction Business&quot; filling out a safety check list that identified a stand-pipe as being present and functional - when it was actually disconnected in a hard to see spot. The firemen consulted the check list, thought they had a good system and proceeded up into the building to fight the fire. Only when they reached the dangerous area that was on fire, did they realise the system did not have any water pressure, and they died trying to retreat amid the confusion. As of June 2011, two out of the three individuals charged in the associated manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide case have been acquitted.

In 2012, Lendlease agreed to pay $56 million in fines and restitution after admitting that the company had routinely over-billed clients and evaded government rules regarding the hiring of women and minority-owned firms. For a ten-year time span ending in 2009, the company along with others devised a scheme to defraud federal, state and local government contracting agencies as well as private clients. The fine is the largest in the city&#x27;s history.

On 29 October 2012 the long boom of a Lendlease construction crane atop the 1,004 foot high One57 snapped during Hurricane Sandy forcing the evacuation of several buildings in Midtown Manhattan.

In October 2018, Lendlease was announced as a contender for a £330 million contract to renovate Manchester Town Hall. Manchester&#x27;s Opposition Leader and former MP John Leech uncovered a history of legal, ethical and worker safety controversy surrounding the two shortlisted companies (Laing O&#x27;Rourke and Lendlease). He said that &quot;Under absolutely no circumstances&quot; should Lendlease ever be considered for a council contract again until they paid a £3 million Grenfell-style cladding bill in the Green Quarter of Manchester. In January 2019, Lendlease was announced as the winner of the contract. Leech criticised the decision and said it showed a lack of concern for local people.

A 23-year-old worker was killed and two others seriously injured in October 2020 on a Lendlease construction site at Curtin University in Western Australia. This occurred when the roof on the new School of Design and the Built Environment building collapsed.

<text>The War Lord is a 1965 American drama historical film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring Charlton Heston. The film, which concerns medieval warfare and culture in 11th-century Normandy, is an adaptation of the play &quot;The Lovers&quot; by Leslie Stevens. The film also features Richard Boone, Rosemary Forsyth, Guy Stockwell, Maurice Evans, Niall MacGinnis, Henry Wilcoxon and James Farentino, with Jon Alderson, Allen Jaffe, Sammy Ross, and Woodrow Parfrey.

==Plot==
Chrysagon de la Cruex is a Norman knight whose Duke gives him a Flemish village to rule and protect, commanding him to keep their goodwill. He and his men arrive in time to beat off Frisian raiders who leave behind a boy, the son of their leader, who conceals his identity. Chrysagon encounters Bronwyn, his future love, as she is being harassed by his own men. Gradually he finds himself falling for the girl he has rescued. Odins, the village chief, later asks Chrysagon&#x27;s permission for Bronwyn to marry Odins&#x27; son Marc, to whom Bronwyn has been betrothed since childhood. Chrysagon approves, but soon regrets the decision. He wants Bronwyn for himself.

He later learns that the pagan practice of &quot;droit du seigneur&quot;, though condemned by the church, still survives. Bronwyn and Marc are married in church and also in a riotous pagan celebration. Chrysagon appears at the latter to claim the right of the lord to sleep with a virgin on her wedding night. While three men restrain Marc, Odins declares that Chrysagon has the right, but all must be done according to the ancient ways, which are rooted in the sacrifice of a virgin to ensure fruitful harvests. Otherwise it is rape. Chrysagon agrees to the Druid way, to prepare a ring of fire in a high place, with his men “wearing iron and standing.” Bronwyn will be brought at the rising of the moon and reclaimed at sunrise.

Odins leads the torchlit procession past Chrysagon&#x27;s men standing as an armed guard, to the chamber at the top of the keep. He tells her she can go but confesses his love for her. She loves him too. Odins comforts his son.

Bronwyn and Chrysagon watch the sunrise. He puts his father&#x27;s ring on her hand and tells his brother he will not give her up.

Marc admits that Chrysagon had the right but he and the villagers are is outraged when Bronwyn is not returned. They do not realize that she is staying of her own free will.

The village sends Marc to contact the Frisians, with evidence that the boy is alive. Bronwyn and Chrysagon are on top of the keep. He talks of carrying her to a far place, after his duty to his Duke is done. They see the Frisians hacking at the drawbridge and sound the alarm. Chrysagon climbs down to attack them, wearing only his braies.

The raiders lay siege to the place, nearly all the village is with them. They call for the boy. Draco demands ransom. Later he leaves, alone, perhaps for help.

The besiegers bring up a battering ram. Lacking a grappling hook, Bors slides down to retrieve the anchor of a boat. They use it to overturn the battering ram into the moat. That night, sheltering behind hurdles, the Frisians set fire to the doors. The defenders use hot oil, which burns up the drawbridge.

The Friesians and villagers build a siege tower, with a bridge that will carry them to the top of the keep. Suddenly, huge boulders and balls of fire descend on the siege tower. It is Draco, come with help from the Duke, including a catapult. He has also been given the demesne. He attacks Chrysagon, who stabs him unwillingly in the struggle. Draco falls to his death.

Chrysagon takes the boy to the Frisian camp. The leader offers him a place with them, and sanctuary for Bronwyn, who Chrysagon calls “my lady”. Chrysagon plans to go to the Duke and mend things for the people. But Marc jumps from a high tree wielding a sickle, wounding Chrysagon under his arm and running for Bronwyn, he is knocked over by Bors and becomes impaled on a tree branch. Chrysagon confers the fief to one of his men, until he returns. Bors and Chrysagon, clutching his wounded side, ride off.

==Cast==
* Charlton Heston as Chrysagon
* Rosemary Forsyth as Bronwyn
* Richard Boone as Bors
* Guy Stockwell as Draco
* Maurice Evans as Priest
* James Farentino as Marc
* Henry Wilcoxon as Frisian Prince
* Niall MacGinnis as Odins

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Jerome Moross. The main musical theme was released as a guitar instrumental by The Shadows. A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records in 1965.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 9 critics.

Critics largely lauded its &quot;gritty&quot; realistic portrayal of the times, both in physical aspects, such as armor and weapons, structures and scenes, but also in its portrayal of social circumstances and behaviors of Medieval lords and serfs.

Medieval historian Andrew E. Larsen praises the movie&#x27;s realistic portrayal of the physical objects and social relationships of the time. But he asserts the film&#x27;s presentation of paganism among the serfs is an extreme exaggeration, and that the key &quot;custom&quot; of &quot;droit du seigneur&quot; was mythical. He criticizes the film&#x27;s romanticizing of &quot;what is, essentially, rape,&quot; adding that—while such rapes have happened, at the time—they lacked any legal standing.

<doc id="1166399" wikidata="Q2285219" url="?curid=1166399" title="Californios">
<text>Californios (singular Californio) are Californians of Spanish descent, especially those descended from settlers of the 17th through 19th centuries before California was annexed by the United States. California&#x27;s Spanish-speaking community has resided there since 1683. Alongside the Tejanos of Texas and Neomexicanos of New Mexico and Colorado, Californios are part of the larger group of descendants of Spaniards in the United States, which has inhabited the American Southwest and the West Coast since the 16th century.

The term &quot;Californio&quot; (historical, regional Spanish for &#x27;Californian&#x27;) was originally applied by and to the Spanish-speaking residents of &quot;Las Californias&quot; during the periods of Spanish California and Mexican California, between 1683 and 1848. The first Californios were the children of the early Spanish military expeditions into northern reaches of the Californias. Many of their fathers were soldiers who established the presidios of California and guarded the California mission system.

Later, the primary cultural focus of the Californio population became the &quot;Vaquero&quot; tradition practiced by the landed gentry, who received large land grants and created the Rancho system. In the 1820s–40s, American and European settlers increasingly migrated to Mexican California. Many married Californio women and became Mexican citizens, learning Spanish and often converting to Catholicism, the state religion. They are often also considered Californios, for their adherence to Californio language and culture.

In 2004 studies estimated that between 300,000 and 500,000 state inhabitants have Spanish ancestry from the colonial and Mexican eras of California.

== Definitions ==

The term &quot;Californio&quot; has different meanings depending on the author or source. According to the Real Academia Española, a Californio is a person native to California. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a Californio as both a native or resident of this state and a specific ethnic group: the Spanish settlers and their descendants in California.

Authors such as Douglas Monroy, Damian Bacich or Covadonga Lamar Prieto, among others, define Californios as exclusively applying to Alta California residents and their descendants.  

Historians Hunt Janin and Ursula Carlson consider a Californio to be any settler who migrated to Alta California and their descendants; and also non-Spanish immigrants who intermarried with Spanish and integrated into the Californio culture during the Mexican era, and their descendants.

Calisphere and author Ferol Egan restrict the meaning of Californio to the Californian elite who acquired land during the Spanish and Mexican periods and their descendants.

Leonard Pitt considers a Californio to be any Spanish-speaking person born in California. Writer Jose Antonio Burciaga considers Californios to be any Spanish descendants living in California, even if they have lived there temporarily. Burciaga, in a 1995 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, points to such examples as Cesar Chavez, Luisa Moreno and Bert Corona.

As seen here, sources differ on elements of classification of the term “Californio”. “At a minimum” means the most restrictive grouping included within every grouping stated above. Thus, this group consists of the Californian elite who were descendants of Spanish settlers and who acquired land during the Spanish and Mexican periods and their descendants. “At a maximum” means the most expansive definition inferred above. This group consists of any settler who migrated to California or any person born in California and their descendants, plus anyone who resides in California.

== History ==

=== Early colonization ===

In 1769, Gaspar de Portolá and less than two hundred men, on expedition founded the Presidio of San Diego (military post). On July 16, Franciscan friars Junípero Serra, Juan Viscaino and Fernando Parron raised and &#x27;blessed a cross&#x27;, establishing the first mission in upper Las Californias, Mission San Diego de Alcalá. Colonists began arriving in 1774.

Monterey, California was established in 1770 by Father Junípero Serra and Gaspar de Portolà (first governor of Las Californias province (1767–1770), explorer and founder of San Diego and Monterey). Monterey was settled with two friars and about 40 men and served as the capital of California from 1777 to 1849. The nearby Carmel Mission, in Carmel, California was moved there after a year in Monterey to keep the mission and its Mission Indians away from the Monterey Presidio soldiers. It was the headquarters of the original Alta California province missions headed by Father-President Junípero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784—he is buried there. Monterey was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. All ships were supposed to clear through Monterey and pay the roughly 42% tariff (customs duties on imported goods before trading anywhere else in Alta California). The oldest governmental building in the state is the Monterey Custom House and California&#x27;s Historic Landmark Number One. The &quot;Californian&quot;, California&#x27;s oldest newspaper, was first published in Monterey on August 15, 1846, after the city&#x27;s occupation by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron on July 7, 1846.

Late in 1775, Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza led an overland expedition over the Gila River trail he had discovered in 1774 to bring colonists from Sonora New Spain (Mexico) to California to settle two missions, one presidio, and one pueblo (town). Anza led 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They started out with 695 horses and mules and 385 Texas Longhorn bulls and cows—starting the cattle and horse industry in California. About 600 horses and mules and 300 cattle survived the trip. In 1776 about 200 leather-jacketed soldiers, Friars, and colonists with their families moved to what was called Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) to start building a mission and a presidio there. The leather jackets the soldiers wore consisted of several layers of hardened leather and were strong enough body armor to usually stop an Indian arrow. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals—doubling roughly every two years. They partially displaced the Tule Elk and pronghorn antelope who had lived there in large herds previously.

Anza selected the sites of the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de Asís in what is now San Francisco; on his way back to Monterey, he sited Mission Santa Clara de Asís and the pueblo San Jose in the Santa Clara Valley but did not initially leave settlers to settle them. Mission San Francisco de Asís (or Mission Dolores), the sixth Spanish mission, was founded on June 29, 1776, by Lieutenant José Joaquin Moraga and Father Francisco Palóu (a companion of Junípero Serra).

On November 29, 1777, El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe (The Town of Saint Joseph of Guadalupe now called simply San Jose) was founded by José Joaquín Moraga on the first &quot;pueblo&quot;-town not associated with a mission or a military post (&quot;presidio&quot;) in Alta California. The original San Jose settlers were part of the original group of 200 settlers and soldiers that had originally settled in Yerba Buena (San Francisco). Mission Santa Clara, founded in 1777, was the eighth mission founded and closest mission to San Jose. Mission Santa Clara was from the original San Jose pueblo site in neighboring Santa Clara. Mission San José was not founded until 1797, about north of San Jose in what is now Fremont.

The Los Angeles Pobladores (&quot;villagers&quot;) is the name given to the 44 original Sonorans—22 adults and 22 children—who settled the Pueblo of Los Angeles in 1781. The &quot;pobladores&quot; were agricultural families from Sonora, Mexico. They were the last settlers to use the Anza trail as the Quechans (Yumas) closed the trail for the next 40 years shortly after they had passed over it. Almost none of the settlers was &quot;españoles&quot; (Spanish); the rest had &quot;casta&quot; (caste) designations such as &quot;mestizo&quot;, &quot;indio&quot;, and &quot;negro&quot;. Some classifications were changed in the California Census of 1790, as often happened in colonial Spanish America.

The settlers and escort soldiers who founded the towns of San José de Guadalupe, Yerba Buena (San Francisco), Monterey, San Diego and La Reina de Los Ángeles were primarily mestizo and of mixed Negro and Native American ancestry from the province of Sonora y Sinaloa in Mexico. Recruiters in Mexico of the Fernando Rivera y Moncada expedition and other expeditions later, who were charged with founding an agricultural community in Alta California, had a difficult time persuading people to emigrate to such an isolated outpost with no agriculture, no towns, no stores or developments of almost any kind. The majority of settlers were recruited from the northwestern parts of Mexico. The only tentative link with Mexico was via ship after the Quechans (Yumas) closed the Colorado River&#x27;s Yuma Crossing in 1781. For the next 40 years, an average of only 2.5 ships per year visited California with 13 years showing no recorded ships arriving.

In Californio society, &quot;casta&quot; (caste) designations carried more weight than they did in older communities of central Mexico. One similar concept was the &quot;gente de razón&quot;, a term literally meaning &quot;people of reason&quot;. It designated peoples who were culturally Hispanic (that is, they were not living in traditional Native American communities) and had adopted Christianity. This served to distinguish the Mexican &quot;Indio&quot; settlers and converted Californian &quot;Indios&quot; from the &quot;barbaro&quot; (barbarian) Californian Native Americans, who had not converted or become part of the Hispanic towns. California&#x27;s Governor Pío Pico was criticized for his alleged descent from mestizo and &quot;mulato&quot; (mulatto) settlers.

=== Later years of Mexican rule ===

In the 1830s, the newly formed Mexican government was experiencing difficulties, having gone through several revolts, wars, and internal conflicts and a seemingly never-ending string of Mexican Presidents. One of the problems in Mexico was the large amount of land controlled by the Catholic Church (estimated then at about one-third of all settled property), which was continually granted property by many landowners when they died and controlled property supposedly held in trust for the Native Americans. This land, as it gradually accumulated, was seldom sold, as it cost nothing to keep, but could be rented out to gain additional income for the Catholic Church to pay its priests, friars, bishops, and other expenses. The Catholic Church was the largest and richest landowner in Mexico and its provinces. In California the situation was even more pronounced, as the Franciscan friars held over 90% of all settled property, supposedly in trust for the mission Indians.

In 1834, secularization laws that voided the mission control of lands in the northern settlements under Mexican rule were enacted. The missions directed thousands of Indians in herding livestock, growing crops and orchards, weaving cloth, etc. for the missions, presidios, and pueblo (town) dwellers. The mission lands and herds formerly controlled by the missions were usually distributed to the settlers around each mission. Since most had almost no money, the land was distributed or granted free or at very little cost to friends and families of the government officials (or those who paid the highest bribes).

The Californio Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, for example, was reputed to be the richest man in California before the California Gold Rush. Vallejo oversaw the secularization of Mission San Francisco Solano and the distributions of its roughly . He founded the towns of Sonoma and Petaluma, California, owned Mare Island and the future town site of Benicia, California, and was granted the Rancho Petaluma, the Rancho Suscol and other properties by Governor José Figueroa in 1834 and later. Vallejo&#x27;s younger brother, Jose Manuel Salvador Vallejo (1813–1876), was granted the Rancho Napa and other additional grants known as Salvador&#x27;s Ranch. Over the hills of Mariano Vallejo&#x27;s estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousands of sheep. He occupied a home on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with hospitality; few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda. About 1849 on his home farm called Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life.

Vallejo tried to get the California State Capital moved permanently to Benicia, California on land he sold to the state government in December, 1851. It was named Benicia for the General&#x27;s wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo. The General intended that the prospective city be named &quot;Francisca&quot; after his wife, but this name was dropped when the city of Yerba Buena changed its name to &quot;San Francisco&quot; on January 30, 1847. Benicia was the third site selected to serve as the California state capital, and its newly constructed city hall was California&#x27;s capitol from February 11, 1853, to February 25, 1854. Vallejo gave the Rancho Suscol to his oldest daughter, Epifania Guadalupe Vallejo, on April 3, 1851, as a wedding present when she married U.S. Army General John H. Frisbie. It is unknown what he gave as a wedding present when his two daughters Natalia and Jovita married the brothers, Attila Haraszthy and Agoston Haraszthy, on the same day—June 1, 1863.

In some cases particular mission land and livestock were split into parcels and then distributed by drawing lots. In nearly all cases the Indians got very little of the mission land or livestock. Whether any of the proceeds of these sales made their way back to Mexico City is unknown. These lands had been worked by settlers and the much larger settlements of local Native American Kumeyaay peoples on the missions for several generations in some cases. When the missions were secularized or dismantled and the Indians did not have to live under continued friar and military control, they were left essentially to survive on their own. Many of the Native Americans reverted to their former tribal existence and left the missions, while others found they could get room and board and some clothing by working for the large ranches that took over the former mission lands and livestock. Many natives who had learned to ride horses and knew a smattering of Spanish were recruited to become vaqueros (cowboys or cattle herders) that worked the cattle and horses on the large ranchos and did other work. Some of these rancho owners and their hired hands would make up the bulk of the few hundred Californios fighting in the brief Mexican–American War conflicts in California. Some of the Californios and California Native Americans fought on the side of the U.S. settlers during the conflict, with some joining John Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion.

=== U.S. conquest of California ===
Before the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848, the Californios forced the Mexican appointed governor, Manuel Micheltorena, to flee back to Mexico with most of his troops. Pío Pico, a Californio, was the governor of California during the conflict.

The Pacific Squadron, the United States Naval force stationed in the Pacific was instrumental in the capture of Alta California after war was declared on April 24, 1846. The U.S. Navy with its force of 350–400 U.S. Marines and &quot;bluejacket&quot; sailors on board several U.S. Naval ships near California were essentially the only significant United States military force on the Pacific Coast in the early months of the Mexican–American War. The Royal Navy Pacific Station ships in the Pacific had more men and were more heavily armed than the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron, but did not have orders to help or hinder the occupation of California. New orders would have taken almost two years to get back to the British ships. The Marines were stationed aboard each ship to assist in ship-to-ship combat, as snipers in the rigging, and to defend against boarders. They could also be detached for use as armed infantry. In addition, there were some &quot;bluejacket&quot; sailors on each ship that could be detached for shore duty as artillery crews and infantry, leaving the ship functional though short handed. The artillery used were often small naval cannon converted to land use. The Pacific Squadron had orders, in the event of war with Mexico, to seize the ports in Mexican California and elsewhere along the Pacific Coast.

The only other United States military force in California at the time was a small exploratory expedition led by Lieutenant Colonel John C. Frémont, made up of 30 topographical, surveying, etc. army troops and about 25 men hired as guides and hunters. The Frémont expedition had been dispatched to California, in 1845, from the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.

Rumors that the Californio government in California was planning to arrest and deport many of the new residents as they had in 1844 led to a degree of uncertainty. On June 14, 1846, thirty-three settlers in Sonoma Valley took preemptive action and captured the small Californio garrison of Sonoma, California without firing a shot and raised a homemade flag with a bear and star (the &quot;Bear Flag&quot;) to symbolize their taking control. The words &quot;California Republic&quot; appeared on the flag but were never officially adopted by the insurgents. The present flag of California is based on the original &quot;Bear Flag&quot;.

Their capture of the small garrison in Sonoma was later called the &quot;Bear Flag Revolt&quot;. The Republic&#x27;s only commander-in-chief was William B. Ide, whose command lasted 25 days. On June 23, 1846, Frémont arrived from the future state of Oregon&#x27;s border with about 30 soldiers and 30 scouts and hunters and took command of the &quot;Republic&quot; in the name of the United States. Frémont began to recruit a militia from among the new settlers living around Sutter&#x27;s Fort to join with his forces. Many of these settlers had just arrived over the California Trail and many more would continue to arrive after July 1846 when they got to California. The Donner Party were the last travelers on the trail in late 1846 when they were caught by early snow while they were trying to get across the Sierra Nevada.

Under orders from John D. Sloat, Commodore of the Pacific Squadron, the U.S. Marines and some of the bluejacket sailors from the U.S. Navy sailing ships with the and captured the Alta California capital city of Monterey, California on July 7, 1846. The only shots fired were salutes by the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor to the U.S. flag now flying over Monterey. Two days later on July 9, , under Captain John S. Montgomery, landed 70 Marines and bluejacket sailors at Clark&#x27;s Point in San Francisco Bay and captured Yerba Buena (now named San Francisco) without firing a shot.

On July 11, the Royal Navy sloop entered San Francisco Bay, causing Montgomery to man his defenses. The large British ship, 2,600 tons with a crew of 600, man-of-war , flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, also arrived at about this time outside Monterey Harbor. Both British ships observed, but did not enter the conflict.

Shortly after July 9, when it became clear the US Navy was taking action, the short-lived Bear Flag Republic was converted into a United States military occupation and the Bear Flag was replaced by the U.S. flag. Commodore Robert F. Stockton took over as the senior U.S. military commander in California in late July 1846 and asked Frémont&#x27;s force of California militia and his 60 men to form the California Battalion with U.S. Army pay and ranks with Fremont in command. The California &quot;Republic&quot; disbanded and William Ide enlisted in the California Battalion, when it was established in late July 1846, as a private.

The first job given to the California Battalion and was to assist in the capture of San Diego and Pueblo de Los Angeles. On July 26, 1846, Lieutenant Colonel Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion of about 160 boarded the sloop , under the command of Captain Samuel Francis Du Pont, and sailed for San Diego. They landed July 29, 1846, and a detachment of Marines and blue-jackets, followed shortly by Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion from &quot;Cyane&quot;, landed and took possession of the town without firing a shot. Leaving about 40 men to garrison San Diego, Fremont continued on to Los Angeles where on August 13, with the Navy band playing and colors flying, the combined forces of Stockton and Frémont entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, without a man killed nor shot fired. U.S. Marine Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie, Frémont&#x27;s second in command, was appointed military commander of Los Angeles with an inadequate force from 30 to 50 California Battalion troops stationed there to keep the peace.

In Pueblo de Los Angeles, the largest city in California with about 3,000 residents, things might have remained peaceful, except that Major Gillespie placed the town under martial law, greatly angering some of the Californios. On September 23, 1846, about 200 Californios under Californio General José María Flores staged a revolt, the Siege of Los Angeles, and exchanged shots with the Americans in their quarters at the Government House. Gillespie and his men withdrew from their headquarters in town to Fort Hill which, unfortunately, had no water. Gillespie was caught in a trap, badly outnumbered by the besiegers. John Brown, an American, called by the Californios Juan Flaco, meaning &quot;Lean John&quot;, succeeded in breaking through the Californio lines and riding by horseback to San Francisco Bay (a distance of almost ) in an amazing 52 hours where he delivered to Stockton a dispatch from Gillespie notifying him of the situation. Gillespie, on September 30, finally accepted the Californio terms and departed for San Pedro with his forces, weapons, flags and two cannon (the others were spiked and left behind). Gillespie&#x27;s men were accompanied by the exchanged American prisoners and several non-Californio residents.

It would take about four months of intermittent sparring before Gillespie could again raise the same American flag originally flown over Los Angeles. Los Angeles was retaken without a fight on January 10, 1847. Following their defeat at the Battle of La Mesa, the Californio government signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, which ended the war in California on January 13, 1847. The main Californio military force, known as the Californio lancers, was disbanded. On January 16, 1847, Commodore Stockton appointed Frémont military governor of U.S. territorial California.

Some Californios fought on both sides of the conflict (U.S. and Mexico). The battlefield memorials attest to the heroic fight and loss on both sides.

==== Californio battles ====

Most towns in California surrendered without a shot being fired on either side. What little fighting that did occur usually involved small groups of disaffected Californios and small groups of soldiers, marines or militia.
* 1846
** Battle of Dominguez Rancho, October 9, 1846. José Antonio Carrillo, near Los Angeles, leads Californio forces against 350 marines and sailors who retreated.
** Battle of San Pasqual, 6 December 1846. US Cavalry General Stephen Kearny&#x27;s dragoons, after a grueling journey across New Mexico and the Mojave Desert, cross into California with about 100 men and are joined by Kit Carson&#x27;s 20 scouts and about 40 men under Gillespie north of San Diego. In a poorly thought out and uncoordinated attack with wet powder and worn out mules Kearny loses about 19 of his men in a fight with about 150 Californio lancers led by Andrés Pico—brother of Pio Pico. Californio casualties are unknown. By the time reinforcements came from U.S. forces in San Diego, the Californio forces were already gone.
** Temecula Massacre, December 1846. Californios and Cahuilla Indians combine to wipe out a party of Pauma Band Luiseño Indians responsible for a massacre of eleven Californios, near Temecula.
* 1847
** January 5, 1847. Frémont near the San Buenaventura Mission, with about 400 men and six field pieces, disperses a force of 60–70 Californio Lancers.
** Battle of Rio San Gabriel, January 8, 1847. Stephen Kearny and Stockton&#x27;s combined force of about 600 men (about a battalion equivalent) defeat the roughly 160-man Californio Lancer force near Los Angeles. Casualties are about one man on each side.
** Battle of La Mesa, January 9, 1847. Kearny and Robert F. Stockton&#x27;s combined US forces defeat the Californios in the final battle in California, at present day Montebello, east of Los Angeles. Casualties are about one man on each side.

In late December, 1846, while Fremont was in Santa Barbara, Bernarda Ruíz de Rodriguez, a wealthy educated woman of influence and town matriarch, asked to speak with him. She advised him that a generous peace would be to his political advantage. Fremont later wrote of this 2-hour meeting, &quot;I found that her object was to use her influence to put an end to the war, and to do so upon such just and friendly terms of compromise as would make the peace acceptable and enduring&quot;. The next day, Bernarda accompanied Fremont south.

On January 11, 1847, General Jose Maria Flores turned over his command to Andrés Pico and fled. On January 12, Bernarda went alone to Pico&#x27;s camp and told him of the peace agreement she and Fremont had forged. Fremont and two of Pico&#x27;s officers agreed to the terms for a surrender, and Jose Antonio Carrillo penned Articles of Capitulation in both English and Spanish. The first seven articles were almost entirely from Ruiz&#x27;s suggestions. The story of Bernarda Ruiz is based largely on two short paragraphs and a footnote in Fremont&#x27;s memoirs, first published in 1887. Many aspects of the story cannot be verified in primary source materials.

On January 13, at a deserted rancho at the north end of Cahuenga Pass (modern-day North Hollywood), John Fremont, Andres Pico and six others signed the Articles of Capitulation, which became known as the Treaty of Cahuenga. Fighting ceased, thus ending the war in California.

=== Californios after U.S. annexation ===
In 1848, Congress set up a Board of Land Commissioners to determine the validity of Mexican land grants in California. California Senator William M. Gwin presented a bill that, when approved by the Senate and the House on March 3, 1851, became the California Land Act of 1851. It stated that unless grantees presented evidence supporting their title within two years, the property would automatically pass back into the public domain. Rancho owners cited the articles VIII and X of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, wherein it guaranteed full protection of all property rights for Mexican citizens—with an unspecified time limit.

Many ranch owners with their thousands of acres and large herds of cattle, sheep and horses went on to live prosperous lives under U.S. rule. Former commander of the California Lancers Andrés Pico became a U.S. citizen after his return to California and acquired the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando ranch which makes up large part of what is present day Los Angeles. He went on to become a California State Assemblyman and later a California State Senator. His brother former governor of Alta California (under Mexican rule) Pío Pico also became a U.S. citizen and a prominent ranch owner/businessman in California after the war. 

Many others were not so fortunate as droughts decimated their herds in the early 1860s and they could not pay back the high cost mortgages (poorly understood by the mostly illiterate ranchers) they had taken out to improve their lifestyle and subsequently lost much or all of their property when they could not be repaid.

Californios did not disappear. Some people in the area still have strong identities as Californios. Thousands of people who are descended from the Californios have well-documented genealogies of their families.

The developing agricultural economy of California allowed many Californios to continue living in pueblos alongside Native peoples and other Mexicans well into the 20th century. These settlements grew into modern California cities, including Santa Ana, San Diego, San Fernando, San Jose, Monterey, Los Alamitos, San Juan Capistrano, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Arvin, Mariposa, Hemet and Indio.

From the 1850s until the 1960s, the Hispanics (of Spanish, Mexican and regional Native American origins) lived in relative autonomy. They practiced a degree of social racial segregation by custom, while maintaining Spanish-language newspapers, entertainment, schools, bars, and clubs. Cultural practices were often tied to local churches and mutual aid societies. At some point in the early 20th century, the official recordkeepers (census takers, city records, etc.) began grouping together all Californios, Mexicanos, and Native (&quot;Indio&quot;) peoples with Spanish surnames under the terms &quot;Spanish&quot;, &quot;Mexican&quot;, and sometimes, &quot;colored&quot;; some Californios even intermarried with Mexican Americans (those whose ancestors were refugees escaping the Mexican Revolution in 1910).

Alexander V. King has estimated that there were between 300,000 and 500,000 descendants of Californios in 2004.

====California Gold Rush====

In 1848, gold is discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, near Coloma, California. This discovery was made only nine days before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, which turned over California to the United States as a result of the Mexican–American War.

From the end of 1849 to the end of 1852, the population in California increased from 107,000 to 264,000 due to the California Gold Rush. In early 1849, approximately 6,000 Mexicans, many of whom were Californios who remained after the United States had annexed the territory, were prospecting for gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Although the territory they were in had up until recently been Mexican land, Californios and other Mexicans very quickly became the minorities and were seen as the foreigners. Once the Gold Rush had truly started in 1849, the campsites were segregated by nationality, further establishing the fact that &quot;Americans&quot; had taken the title as the majority ethnicity in Northern California. Because the Californio &quot;foreigners&quot; so quickly became a minority, their claims to land protected under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were ignored when miners overran their land and squatted. Any protests by Californios were quickly put down by hastily formed Euro-American militias, so any legal protection provided by the new California legislature was ineffective when the threat of violence and lynchings loomed. Even if Californios were able to win their land back in court, often lawyer&#x27;s fees cost large sums of land that left them with a fraction of their former wealth.

==== Working conditions ====

Many Latino miners were experienced due to learning a &quot;dry-digging&quot; technique in the Mexican mining state of Sonora. Their early success drew praise and respect from Euro-American miners, they eventually became jealous and used threats and violence to force Mexican workers out of their plots and into less lucrative ones. In addition to these informal forms of discrimination, Anglo miners also worked to establish Jim Crow-like laws to prevent Latinos from mining altogether. In 1851, mob violence as well as the Foreign Miners&#x27; Tax discussed below forced between five thousand and fifteen thousand foreigners out of work in just a few months.

According to Antonio F. Coronel&#x27;s accounts, there was systematic race-influenced violence conducted by Americans to force out Californios and other Latinos. One account tells of a Frenchman and &quot;un español&quot; being lynched for supposed theft in 1848. Despite offers by Californios to replace the reported amount of gold stolen, they were still hanged. In addition, later in the Gold Rush, Coronel and his group found a rich vein of gold on the American River. When Euro-Americans caught wind of this, they invaded the claim armed and insisted it was their plot, forcing out Coronel and ending his mining career. Accounts like these show the harsh and violent living and working conditions that Californios were faced with during the Gold Rush. Discriminatory and racist treatment and laws as well as being so vastly outnumbered forced them out of their native lands despite assurances by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that they could remain.

==== Foreign Miners&#x27; Tax ====

In response to the Mexican resistance to the American population, white miners called for something to be done about the &quot;Sonoran&quot; miner &quot;problem&quot;. In response, in 1850, the Californian government introduced a tax on foreign miners who were working plots, called the Foreign Miners&#x27; Tax Law. The claimed purpose of the tax was to fund the government&#x27;s efforts to protect the foreign workers. There are conflicting reports on the amount of the tax ranging from $20 to $30 per month. 

This extremely high tax forced all but the most successful Latinos to stop mining as they were unable to obtain enough gold to make mining profitable. This left only the most successful of the Mexican prospectors, who ironically were the ones who drew the most ire from the Euro-American miners initially. By 1851, when the tax law was repealed, approximately two-thirds of the Latinos and Californios that had been living and working in mining areas had been driven out by the tax. After repealing the $20 or $30 per month tax, the California legislature instituted a much more reasonable $3 per month tax in 1852.

== Californio society and customs ==

=== Government ===
In the Spanish period, Alta California (&quot;Upper California&quot;) was nominally controlled by a governor appointed by the Spanish government. The governors of California were at first appointed by the Viceroy (nominally under the control of the Spanish Crown).

After 1821 and Mexican independence, there were approximately 40 Mexican Presidents from 1821 to 1846. Their administrations appointed the governor. The costs of the minimal Alta California government were paid mainly from revenues of the roughly 40–100% import tariff collected at the entry port of Monterey.

The other center of Spanish power in Alta California was the Franciscan friars. As heads of 21 missions, they often resisted the powers of the governors. None of the Franciscan friars was a Californio, and their influence rapidly waned after Mexico secularized the missions in the 1830s.

The instability of the Mexican government (especially in its early years), Alta California&#x27;s geographic isolation, the growing ability of Alta California&#x27;s residents, including immigrants, to gain success; and an increase in the Californio population created a schism with the national government. As Spanish and Mexican period immigrants were surpassed in number by residents who had little affinity with the national government, the political and social environment enabled disagreement with the central government to form. Governors had little material support from the distant capital, Mexico City, and generally had to deal with Alta Californians themselves. Mexico-born governor Manuel Victoria was forced to flee in 1831, after losing a fight against a local uprising at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass.

As Californios increasingly assumed positions of power in the Alta California government (including that of governor), rivalries emerged between northern and southern regions. Several times, Californio leaders attempted to break away from Mexico, most notably Juan Bautista Alvarado in 1836. Southern regional leaders, led by Pio Pico, made several attempts of their own to relocate the capital from Monterey to the more populated Los Angeles.

=== Foreigners ===
The independent minded Californios were also influenced by increasing numbers of immigrant foreigners (mostly English, Swiss, and French, English-speaking Americans being grouped with the &quot;English&quot;, or Anglos) who entered the district becoming Mexican Citizens, and Californios by marriage. The Swiss immigrants remained neutral merchants in Yerba Buena, later known as San Francisco, from the 1830s onward able to practice Benedictine Roman Catholicism after emigrating from Switzerland during the Swiss Restoration Period. An increasing number of Swiss immigrants populated New Helvetia, under John Sutter, later on in 1841 with a land grant from then governor Juan Alvarado. Immigrants assimilated with the Californios, becoming Mexican citizens and gaining land either independently granted to them or through marriage to Californio women. They also began to be active in local politics.

For example, American Abel Stearns was an ally of the Californio José Antonio Carrillo in the 1831 Victoria incident, yet sided with the southern Californians against the Californio would-be governor Alvarado in 1836. Alvarado recruited a company of riflemen from Tennessee, many of them former trappers who had settled in the Monterey Bay area. The company was led by another American, Isaac Graham. When the Americans refused to fight against fellow Americans, Alvarado was forced to negotiate a settlement.

=== Ethnicity ===

Californios included the descendants of agricultural settlers and retired escort soldiers deployed from what is modern-day Mexico. Most were of mixed ethnicities, usually &quot;Mestizo&quot; (Spanish and Native American) or mixed African and Amerindian backgrounds.

According to mission records (marriage, baptisms, and burials) and Presidio roster listings, several &quot;leather-jacket&quot; soldiers (&quot;soldados de cuero&quot;), operating as escorts, mission guards, and other military duty personnel were described as &quot;europeo&quot; (i.e., born in Europe), while most civilian settlers were classified as of mixed origins (&quot;coyote&quot;, &quot;mulatto&quot;, etc.). The current term &quot;mestizo&quot; was rarely used in mission records: more common terms were &quot;indio&quot;, &quot;europeo&quot;, &quot;mulato&quot;, &quot;coyote&quot;, &quot;castizo&quot;, and other caste terms.

An example of European-born soldiers are the twenty-five from Lieutenant Pedro Fages detachment of Catalan Volunteers. Most of the soldiers on the Portola-Serra expedition of 1769 and the de Anza expeditions of 1774 and 1775 were recruited from Spanish Army infantry regiments then stationed in Mexico. Many were assigned to garrison the presidios, and retired at the end of their ten-year enlistments. Numerous veterans settled in California. Because of the demographic bias in this period toward men among the Spanish, some men who stayed in California married native Californian women who had converted to Christianity at the missions.

=== Women in Californio society ===

The social life of Californio society was extremely important in both politics and business, and women played an important part in these interactions. They helped facilitate such interactions for their husbands, and therefore themselves, in order to advance in the social and political power in Californio society. Men sought women with high social skills, as they understood the power women could have on family and social dealings.

In movies and television accounts of this period have portrayed women as romanticized, characterized by their beauty and fun-loving nature. They have also been shown as raised to be very sheltered and protected.

As women played a key role in the development of Alta California, they continued in this role as it changed from a Mexican territory to a United States possession. As foreign, non-Spanish speaking men moved into California, those who wished to join the upper echelons of the established social hierarchy began to use marriage with women of established Californio families as a way to join the elite. Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners had been common during the time of Mexican rule and these increased after the 1848 American annexation and Gold Rush in California. Such marriages combined the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. As Americans increased in number, however, they pushed out Californios from power in California.

=== Family and education ===

The family was characteristically patriarchal; sons were expected to defer to fathers for all their lives. Women had full rights of property ownership and control unless she was married or had a living father; the males had almost complete control of all family members. Individual families of means paid to have their children educated, with by priests or private tutors. Few early immigrants knew how to read or write, so only a few hundred inhabitants could.

=== Settlement ===
The Spanish colonial government, and later, Mexican officials encouraged through recruitment civilians from the northern and western provinces of Mexico such as Sonora. This was not well received by Californios, and was one of the factors leading to revolt against Mexican rule. Sonorans came to California despite the area&#x27;s isolation and the lack of central government support. Many of the soldiers&#x27; wives considered California to be a cultural wasteland and a hardship assignment. 

An incentive for the soldiers that remained in California after service was the opportunity to receive a land grant that probably was not possible elsewhere. This made most of California&#x27;s early settlers military retirees with a few civilian settlers from Mexico. Since it was a frontier society, the initial rancho housing was characterized as &quot;rude and crude&quot;—little more than mud huts with thatched roofs. As the rancho owners prospered these residences could be upgraded to more substantial adobe structures with tiled roofs. Some buildings took advantage of local tar pits (La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles) in an attempt to waterproof roofs. Restorations of these today often suffer from a perception that results in a grander representation than if they had been constructed during the Californio period. The Californio population was 10,000 in 1845, estimated.

=== Ranchos ===
In practice nearly all mission property and livestock became about 455 large Ranchos of California granted by the Californio authorities. The Californio rancho owners claimed about averaging about each. This land was nearly all originally mission land within about of the coast. The Mexican-era land grants by law were provisional for five years in order for the terms of the law to reasonably be fulfilled. The boundaries of these ranchos were not established as they came to be in later times predominately based on what could be understood as figurative boundaries. They were based on just where another granted owner considered the end of their land, lands or vegetation landmarks. Conflict was bound to occur when these land grants were reviewed under United States control. Title to some grants under United States control were rejected based on questionable documents especially when with predated documents, that could have been created post-United States occupancy in January 1847.

After agriculture, cattle, sheep and horses were established by the California Missions, friars, soldiers and Mission Indians, the rancho owners dismissed the friars and the soldiers and took over the mission lands and livestock starting in 1834—the Mission Indians were left to survive however they could. The rancho owners tried to live in a grand style they perceived of the wealthy hidalgos in Spain. They expected the non-rancho owning population to support this lifestyle. Nearly all males rode to where ever they were going at nearly all times making them excellent riders. They indulged in many fiestas, fandangos, rodeos and roundups as the rancho owners often went from rancho to rancho on a large horse bound party circuit. Weddings, christenings, and funerals were all &quot;celebrated&quot; with large gatherings.

Before Mexican independence in 1821, 20 &quot;Spanish&quot; land grants had been issued (at little or no cost) in all of Alta California; many to &quot;a few friends and family of the Alta California governors&quot;. The 1824 Mexican General Colonization Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Catholic Franciscan missions and possibly entice increased Mexican settlement.

When the missions were secularized in 1834–1836 mission property and livestock were supposed to be mostly allocated to the Mission Indians. Historical research shows that the majority of rancho grants were given to retired non-commissioned soldiers. The largest grants to Nieto, Sepúlveda, Domínguez, Yorba, Ávila, Grijalva, and other founding families were examples of this practice.

Many of the foreign residents also became rancho grantees. Some were &quot;Californios by marriage&quot; like Stearns (who was naturalized in Mexico before moving north) and the Englishman William Hartnell. Others married Californios but never became Mexican citizens. Rancho ownership was possible for these men because, under Spanish/Mexican law, married women could independently hold title to property. In the Santa Cruz area, three Californio daughters of the &quot;inválido&quot; José Joaquín Castro (1768–1838) married foreigners yet still received grants to Rancho Soquel, Rancho San Agustin and Rancho Refugio.

=== Taxation ===
Since the government depended on import tariffs (also called Custom duties and ad-valorem taxes) for its income there was virtually no property tax. Under Spanish/Mexican rule, all landowners were expected to the diezmo, a compulsory tithe to the Catholic Church of one tenth of the fruits of agriculture and animal husbandry, business profits or salaries. Priest salaries and mission expenses were paid out of this money and/or collected goods.

The mandatory Diezmo ended with the secularization of the missions, greatly reducing rancho taxes until the U.S. takeover. Today&#x27;s state property tax system makes large self-supporting cattle ranches uneconomical in most cases.

=== Horses in Californio culture ===

Horses were plentiful and often left, after being broken in, to wander around with a rope around their necks for easy capture. It was not unusual for a rider to use one horse until it was exhausted, before switching its bridle to another horse—letting the first horse free to wander. Horse ownership for all except a few exceptional animals were almost community property. Horses were so common and of so little use that they were often destroyed to keep them from eating the grass needed by the cattle. California Indians later developed a taste for horse flesh as food and helped keep the number of horses under control. An unusual use for horses was found in shucking wheat or barley. The wheat and its stems were cut from the gain fields by Indians bearing sickles. The grain with its stems still attached was transported to the harvesting area by solid wheeled ox-cart (nearly the only wheeled transport in California) and put into a circular packed earth corral. A herd of horses was then driven into the same corral or &quot;threshing field&quot;. By keeping the horses moving around the corral their hoofs would, in time, separate the wheat or barley from the chaff. Later the horses would be allowed to escape and the wheat and chaff were collected and then separated by tossing it into the air on a windy day so as to let the wind carry the chaff away. Presumably the wheat was washed before use to remove some of the dirt.

=== Indigenous Californian workforce ===

For these very few rancho owners and their families, this was the Californio&#x27;s Golden Age, although for all the others much different. Much of the agriculture, vineyards and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining mission Indigenous Californian population went from over 80,000 in 1800 to only a few thousand by 1846. Fewer Native Americans meant less food was required and the Franciscan Friars and soldiers supporting the missions disappeared after 1834 when the missions were abolished (secularized). After the Friars and soldiers disappeared, many of the Native Americans deserted the missions and returned to their tribes or found work elsewhere. The new ranchos often gave work to some of the former mission Native Americans. The &quot;Savage tribes&quot; worked for room, board and clothing (and no pay). The former mission Indians performed the majority of the work herding cattle, planting and harvesting the ranchos&#x27; crops. The slowly increasing ranchos and Pueblos at Los Angeles, San Diego, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Jose and Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade. The exceptions were the cattle and horses growing wild on unfenced range land. Originally owned by the missions they were killed for their hides and tallow.

=== Traditional food and materials ===

Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn&#x27;t be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few steaks or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825. Beef, wheat bread products, corn, several types of beans, peas and several types of squash were common meal items with wine and olive oil used when they could be found. 

The mestizo population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average Native Americans ate is unknown since they were in transition from a hunter gatherer society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about &#x27;Indians&#x27; stealing their cattle and horses to eat.

Leather, one of the most common materials available, was used for many products, including saddles, chaps, whips, window and door coverings, riatas (leather braided rope), trousers, hats, stools, chairs, bed frames, etc. Leather was even used for leather armor where soldiers&#x27; jackets were made from several layers of hardened leather sewn together. This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. 

=== Trade ===

From about 1769 to 1824 California averaged about 2.5 ships per year with 13 years showing no ships coming to California. These ships brought a few new settlers and supplies for the pueblos and Missions. Under the Spanish colonial government rules, trade was actively discouraged with non-Spanish ships. The few non-Native American people living in California had almost nothing to trade—the missions and pueblos were subsidized by the Spanish government. The occasional Spanish ships that did show up were usually requested by Californios and had Royal permission to go to California—bureaucracy in action. Prior to 1824, when the newly independent Mexico liberalized the trade rules and allowed trade with non-Mexican ships, the occasional trading ship or U.S. whaler that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh meat and vegetables became more common. The average number of ships from 1825 to 1845 jumped to twenty-five ships per year versus the 2.5 ships per year common for the prior fifty years.

The rancho society had few resources except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off the fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to fancy thread and cloth that could be sewn into fancy cloaks or ladies&#x27; dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from Boston, Massachusetts, Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The trip from Boston, New York City, or Liverpool, England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into San Diego, San Juan Capistrano, San Pedro, San Buenaventura (Ventura), Monterey and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the import tariff of 50–100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana Jr. gives a good first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834–1835. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items during this period.

California was not alone in using the import duty to pay for its government as the U.S. import tariffs at this time were also the way the United States paid for most of its Federal Government. A U.S. average tariff (also called custom duties and ad valorem taxes) of about 25% raised about 89% of all Federal income in 1850.

== Californios in literature ==

*A portrayal of Californio culture is depicted in the novel &quot;Ramona&quot; (1884), written by Helen Hunt Jackson.
*The fictional character of Zorro has become the most identifiable Californio due to novels, short stories, motion pictures and the 1950s television series. The historical facts of the era are sometimes lost in the story-telling.
* Richard Henry Dana Jr., recounted aspects of Californio culture which he saw during his 1834 visit as a sailor in &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;.
* Joseph Chapman, a land realtor noted as the first Yankee to reside in the old Pueblo de Los Angeles in 1831, described Southern California as a paradise yet to be developed. He mentions a civilization of Spanish-speaking colonists, &quot;Californios&quot;, who thrived in the pueblos, the missions, and &quot;ranchos&quot;.
* &quot;The Squatter and the Don&quot;, a novel by María Ruiz de Burton set in 1880s California, depicts a wealthy Californio family&#x27;s legal struggles with immigrant squatters on their land. The novel was based on the legal struggles of General Mariano G. Vallejo, a friend of the author. The novel depicts the legal process by which Californios were often &quot;relieved&quot; of their land. This process was long (most Californios spent up to 15 years defending their grants before the courts), and the legal fees were enough to make many Californios landless. Californios resented having to pay land taxes to United States officials, because the principle of paying taxes for land ownership did not exist in Mexican law. In some cases Californios had little available capital, because their economy had operated on a barter system; they often lost land because of the inability to pay the taxes. They could not compete economically with the European and Anglo-American immigrants who arrived in the region with large amounts of cash.
* Alejandro Murguía (1949-) speaks of growing up in the 20th century playing in the ruins of Missions and his family history as Californios in &quot;The medicine of memory : a Mexica clan in California&quot;.

<text>Rockers Hi-Fi were an electronic dub/dance outfit formed in Birmingham, England in 1991 as Original Rockers. In 1994, they changed their name to Rockers Hi-Fi. Their music was quite popular across Europe as an extension and continuation of the dub music genre.

Their first success came with a few tracks on the Beyond Records &quot;Ambient Dub&quot; series of compilations, and &quot;Push Push&quot; became a dancefloor hit at the beginning of the 90s.

They released four studio albums and also mixed and compiled an album for Studio !K7&#x27;s DJ-Kicks series.

Their urban sound was created by Richard &quot;DJ Dick&quot; Whittingham who began his DJ career in Duran Duran&#x27;s Rum Runner nightclub, he now hosts Leftfoot at the Medicine Bar, and Glyn &quot;Bigga&quot; Bush who continues to produce music as BiggaBush and Lightning Head on his own Lion Head label.

Their song &quot;What a Life!&quot; was part of the soundtrack for the 1995 film &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, and &quot;Going Under (Love &amp; Insanity Dub) (K&amp;D Sessions)&quot; featured in the 2000s film &quot;Traffic&quot;, as well as in the mid-season finale to the first season of the television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;

In 1992, Richard Whittingham and Glyn Bush founded the label Different Drummer, releasing music from both Original Rockers/Rockers Hi-Fi and others.

<doc id="1166402" wikidata="Q9098060" url="?curid=1166402" title="Is Logic Empirical?">
<text>&quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot; is the title of two articles (one by Hilary Putnam and another by Michael Dummett) that discuss the idea that the algebraic properties of logic may, or should, be empirically determined; in particular, they deal with the question of whether empirical facts about quantum phenomena may provide grounds for revising classical logic as a consistent logical rendering of reality. The replacement derives from the work of Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann on quantum logic. In their work, they showed that the outcomes of quantum measurements can be represented as binary propositions and that these quantum mechanical propositions can be combined in a similar way as propositions in classical logic. However, the algebraic properties of this structure are somewhat different from those of classical propositional logic in that the principle of distributivity fails.

The idea that the principles of logic might be susceptible to revision on empirical grounds has many roots, including the work of W. V. Quine and the foundational studies of Hans Reichenbach.

==W. V. Quine==

What is the epistemological status of the laws of logic? What sort of arguments are appropriate for criticising purported principles of logic? In his seminal paper &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism,&quot; the logician and philosopher W. V. Quine argued that all beliefs are in principle subject to revision in the face of empirical data, including the so-called analytic propositions. Thus the laws of logic, being paradigmatic cases of analytic propositions, are not immune to revision.

To justify this claim he cited the so-called paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Birkhoff and von Neumann proposed to resolve those paradoxes by abandoning the principle of distributivity, thus substituting their quantum logic for classical logic.

Quine did not at first seriously pursue this argument, providing no sustained argument for the claim in that paper. In &quot;Philosophy of Logic&quot; (the chapter titled &quot;Deviant Logics&quot;), Quine rejects the idea that classical logic should be revised in response to the paradoxes, being concerned with &quot;a serious loss of simplicity&quot;, and &quot;the handicap of having to think within a deviant logic&quot;. Quine, though, stood by his claim that logic is in principle not immune to revision.

==Hans Reichenbach==

Reichenbach considered one of the anomalies associated with quantum mechanics, the problem of complementary properties. A pair of properties of a system is said to be &quot;complementary&quot; if each one of them can be assigned a truth value in some experimental setup, but there is no setup which assigns a truth value to both properties. The classic example of complementarity is illustrated by the double-slit experiment in which a photon can be made to exhibit particle-like properties or wave-like properties, depending on the experimental setup used to detect its presence. Another example of complementary properties is that of having a precisely observed position or momentum.

Reichenbach approached the problem within the philosophical program of the logical positivists, wherein the choice of an appropriate language was not a matter of the truth or falsity of a given language – in this case, the language used to describe quantum mechanics – but a matter of &quot;technical advantages of language systems&quot;. His solution to the problem was a logic of properties with a three-valued semantics; each property could have one of three possible truth-values: true, false, or indeterminate. The formal properties of such a logical system can be given by a set of fairly simple rules, certainly far simpler than the &quot;projection algebra&quot; that Birkhoff and von Neumann had introduced a few years earlier.

==First article: Hilary Putnam==

In his paper &quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot; Hilary Putnam, whose PhD studies were supervised by Reichenbach, pursued Quine&#x27;s idea systematically. In the first place, he made an analogy between laws of logic and laws of geometry: at one time Euclid&#x27;s postulates were believed to be truths about the physical space in which we live, but modern physical theories are based around non-Euclidean geometries, with a different and fundamentally incompatible notion of straight line.

In particular, he claimed that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic for this reason: realism about the physical world, which Putnam generally maintains, demands that we square up to the anomalies associated with quantum phenomena. Putnam understands realism about physical objects to entail the existence of the properties of momentum and position for quanta. Since the uncertainty principle says that either of them can be determined, but both cannot be determined at the same time, he faces a paradox. He sees the only possible resolution of the paradox as lying in the embrace of quantum logic, which he believes is not inconsistent.

==Quantum logic==
The formal laws of a physical theory are justified by a process of repeated controlled observations. This from a physicist&#x27;s point of view is the meaning of the empirical nature of these laws.

The idea of a propositional logic with rules radically different from Boolean logic in itself was not new. Indeed a sort of analogy had been established in the mid-nineteen thirties by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann between a non-classical propositional logic and some aspects of the measurement process in quantum mechanics. Putnam and the physicist David Finkelstein proposed that there was more to this correspondence than a loose analogy: that in fact there was a logical system whose semantics was given by a lattice of projection operators on a Hilbert space. This, actually, was the correct logic for reasoning about the microscopic world.

In this view, classical logic was merely a limiting case of this new logic. If this were the case, then our &quot;preconceived&quot; Boolean logic would have to be rejected by empirical evidence in the same way Euclidean geometry (taken as the correct geometry of physical space) was rejected on the basis of (the facts supporting the theory of) general relativity. This argument is in favor of the view that the rules of logic are empirical.

That logic came to be known as quantum logic. There are, however, few philosophers today who regard this logic as a replacement for classical logic; Putnam himself may not have held that view any longer at the end of his life. Quantum logic is still used as a foundational formalism for quantum mechanics: but in a way in which primitive events are not interpreted as atomic sentences but rather in operational terms as possible outcomes of observations. As such, quantum logic provides a unified and consistent mathematical theory of physical observables and quantum measurement.

==Second article: Michael Dummett==
In an article also titled &quot;Is Logic Empirical?,&quot; Michael Dummett argues that Putnam&#x27;s desire for realism mandates distributivity: the principle of distributivity is essential for the realist&#x27;s understanding of how propositions are true of the world, in just the same way as he argues the principle of bivalence is. To grasp why, consider why truth tables work for classical logic: first, it must be the case that the variable parts of the proposition are either true or false: if they could be other values, or fail to have truth values at all, then the truth table analysis of logical connectives would not exhaust the possible ways these could be applied. For example intuitionistic logic respects the classical truth tables, but not the laws of classical logic, because intuitionistic logic allows propositions to be other than true or false. Secondly, to be able to apply truth tables to describe a connective depends upon distributivity: a truth table is a disjunction of conjunctive possibilities, and the validity of the exercise depends upon the truth of the whole being a consequence of the bivalence of the propositions, which is true only if the principle of distributivity applies.

Hence Putnam cannot embrace realism without embracing classical logic, and hence his argument to endorse quantum logic because of realism about quanta is a hopeless case.

Dummett&#x27;s argument is all the more interesting because he is not a proponent of classical logic. His argument for the connection between realism and classical logic is part of a wider argument to suggest that, just as the existence of particular class of entities may be a matter of dispute, so a disputation about the objective existence of such entities is also a matter of dispute. Consequently intuitionistic logic is privileged over classical logic, when it comes to disputation concerning phenomena whose objective existence is a matter of controversy.

Thus the question, &quot;Is Logic Empirical?,&quot; for Dummett, leads naturally into the dispute over realism and anti-realism, one of the deepest issues in modern metaphysics.

<doc id="1166407" wikidata="Q2932019" url="?curid=1166407" title="CSS Rappahannock">
<text>CSS Rappahannock, a steam sloop-of-war, was built at the Blackwall Yard on the River Thames by Money Wigram &amp; Son in 1855 as an for the Royal Navy and named HMS &quot;Victor&quot;. Although a handsomely modeled vessel, numerous defects occasioned her sale in 1863. An agent of the Confederate States Government purchased her ostensibly for the China trade, but British authorities suspected she was destined to be a Confederate commerce raider and ordered her detention. Nevertheless, she succeeded in escaping from Sheerness, England, on November 24, with workmen still on board and only a token crew. Her Confederate States Navy officers joined in the English Channel.

When he bought her from the Admiralty through his secret agent on November 14, Commander Matthew F. Maury had intended &quot;Rappahannock&quot; to replace the cruiser and was about to transfer &quot;Georgia&quot;″s guns to her. She was ideal for a cruiser — wooden-hulled and bark-rigged with two engines and a lifting screw propeller.

She was commissioned a Confederate man-of-war underway, but while passing out of the Thames Estuary her bearings burned out and she had to be taken across to Calais for repairs. There Lieutenant C. M. Fauntleroy, CSN, was placed in command. Detained on various pretexts by the French Government, &quot;Rappahannock&quot; never got to sea and was turned over to the United States at the close of the war.

<text>Waihi Beach is a coastal town at the western end of the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It lies 10 kilometres to the east of the town of Waihi, at the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula. The main beach is 10 kilometres long. The town had a permanent population of as of .

At the northern end of Waihi Beach, the Orokawa Scenic Reserve offers several short walking tracks along the coast and to Orokawa Bay. While the main beach is backed by the residential area of the township of Waihi Beach, Orokawa Bay is undeveloped and surrounded by native bush including pōhutukawa, pūriri, and nīkau palms.
At the southern end of the beach is the small settlement of Bowentown and the northern side of the northern Katikati entrance to Tauranga Harbour.

==History and culture==

===Early history===

Māori have lived in the region since pre-European times, with numerous pā sites within a few kilometres of Waihi Beach. There is still evidence of the old pā sites at the Bowentown end of Waihi Beach.

The name &quot;Waihi&quot; (&quot;Rising Water&quot;) is said to be named after a stream which flows into the beach, the later town of Waihi taking its name from the name for the beach.

===Modern history===

The Waihi Beach Hotel was built in 1967 and the Athenree mineral hot springs are located nearby. Nearby Waihi is known for the gold and silver mining operation at Martha Mine and several underground mines.

===Marae===

Otāwhiwhi Marae, located in Bowentown, is a &quot;marae&quot; (tribal meeting ground) of the Ngāi Te Rangi tribe and Ngāi Tauwhao sub-tribe; it includes the Tamaoho &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house).

In October 2020, the Government committed $500,000 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae. The upgrade is expected to create 33 jobs.

<text>Digital Extremes Ltd. is a Canadian video game developer founded in 1993 by James Schmalz. They are best known for creating &quot;Warframe&quot;, a free-to-play cooperative online action game, and co-creating Epic Games&#x27; &quot;Unreal&quot; series of games. Digital Extremes is headquartered in London, Ontario. In 2014, 61% of the company was sold to Chinese holding company Multi Dynamic, now Leyou, for $73 million. In May 2016 Leyou exercised a call option and increased their stake to 97% of Digital Extremes for a total consideration of $138.2 million US. In December 2020, Tencent bought Leyou for 1.3 billion dollars, which included the majority stake in Digital Extremes that Leyou held.

==History==
Founder James Schmalz created &quot;Epic Pinball&quot;, published by then shareware publisher, Epic MegaGames. Bolstered from the success of &quot;Epic Pinball&quot; and the rising technology movement in the mid-&#x27;90s toward realistic 3D graphics, Schmalz founded Digital Extremes in 1993 and the company began co-development with Epic on what would become Epic&#x27;s &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise.

&quot;Unreal&quot; is a first-person shooter, released in 1998, and was followed up with &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; in 1999, which received numerous industry awards. Subsequent sequels in the &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise include &quot;Unreal Championship&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;, and &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;. The &quot;Unreal&quot; series has sold more than 15 million units worldwide across a multitude of game platforms including PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Xbox, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Mac and PC.

According to Scott Miller, the cofounder of the video game company 3D Realms, Digital Extremes was willing to take over development of their much-delayed game &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; in 2004, but the proposal was rejected by others at 3D Realms, which Miller described as a &quot;fatal suicide shot&quot; for the project.

After years of working in the same universe with &quot;Unreal&quot;, Digital Extremes broadened its library and technology with development of its original intellectual property, &quot;Dark Sector&quot;. A third-person shooter released in 2008 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC, &quot;Dark Sector&quot; used Digital Extremes&#x27; proprietary game engine, the Evolution Engine.

Digital Extremes worked with 2K to develop the comic-book franchise video game sequel, &quot;The Darkness II&quot;, which met with positive reviews. Digital Extremes developed the PlayStation 3 version of &quot;BioShock&quot;, as well as developed the multiplayer component of the sequel, &quot;BioShock 2&quot;, while simultaneously developing the multiplayer portion of THQ&#x27;s first-person shooter &quot;Homefront&quot;.

Digital Extremes developed the game for the 2013 &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; film, working with Bandai Namco and Paramount to develop &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which was poorly received.

In October 2014, Sumpo Food Holdings Ltd. acquired a majority share of Digital Extremes, with Perfect World Co. acquiring minority shares. Sumpo was rebranded as Leyou in 2015, and by June 2016, had purchased the remaining shares in Digital Extremes.

In 2016, it was revealed that Digital Extremes&#x27; game &quot;Warframe&quot; had been hacked, exposing the email addresses of more than 700,000 players.

Digital Extremes opened a development studio in Toronto, Canada, and began operations in January 2018.

In December 2020, Leyou was acquired by Tencent, which included Digital Extremes. The developer stated that this would not change how they operate as they remained independent of Tencent, though through Tencent they would be able to provide better support for the Chinese version of the &quot;Warframe&quot; client.

In October 2023, James Schmalz stepped down as CEO, with former &quot;Warframe&quot; director Steve Sinclair promoted to CEO. Community manager Rebecca Ford became the game&#x27;s new director. In the following month, Digital Extremes reportedly laid off about 30 employees, mostly from their external projects division. While the layoffs were confirmed, the company would not state how many people were affected. They also terminated their partnership with Airship Syndicate, returning &quot;Wayfinder&quot; to their control.

==Projects==
Digital Extremes started development of &quot;Warframe&quot;, a free-to-play title, in 2000. Digital Extremes launched &quot;Warframe&quot; on PC in March 2013, PlayStation 4 in November, and on Xbox One in September 2014. The company released &quot;Warframe&quot; on Nintendo Switch in November 2018. Digital Extremes continues to refresh this games-as-a-service title on a regular basis with updates including &quot;Plains of Eidolon&quot; (October 2017), &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; (June 2018), &quot;Fortuna&quot; (November 2018), the Nightwave series (February 2019), &quot;The Jovian Concord&quot; (May 2019), &quot;Empyrean&quot; (Christmas 2019), &quot;Heart of Deimos&quot; (August 2020), &quot;The New War&quot; (December 2021), &quot;Angels of the Zariman&quot; (April 2022), &quot;The Duviri Paradox&quot; (April 2023), and &quot;Warframe 1999&quot; (December 2024).

Digital Extremes worked with developer n-Space to develop the fantasy role-playing video game, &quot;Sword Coast Legends&quot;, set within the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; franchise.

Digital Extremes worked with Madison, Wisconsin-based developer Human Head Studios to publish &quot;Survived By&quot;, a free-to-play bullet-hell MMO with crafting and role-playing elements. &quot;Survived By&quot; was shut down as of April 2019.

During TennoCon 2022, Digital Extremes announced &quot;Soulframe&quot;, an upcoming fantasy MMORPG. It also said that it would be publishing a massively multiplayer online game from Airship Syndicate, &quot;Wayfinder&quot;, but after &quot;Wayfinder&quot; release in August 2023, Digital Extremes cut their external games division, leaving &quot;Wayfinder&quot; under Airship Syndicate&#x27;s control.

==Technology==

Evolution is Digital Extremes&#x27; proprietary game engine. The engine made its debut with &quot;Dark Sector&quot; and was again utilized in &quot;The Darkness II&quot;. 2013&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; featured use of the Evolution engine. It is currently utilised in Warframe and the upcoming &quot;Soulframe&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Since the launch of &quot;Warframe,&quot; its expansion and popularity has grown, resulting in multiple awards. In late 2017, &quot;Warframe&quot; won the Steam Labor of Love award, an award nominated by Steam&#x27;s internal team, but voted on by players. &quot;Warframe&quot; was nominated in The 2017 and 2018 Game Awards as one of the Best Ongoing Games, losing to &quot;Overwatch&quot; and &quot;Fortnite&quot;, respectively.

In early 2018, &quot;Warframe&quot; won the People&#x27;s Voice Webby Award for Best Action Game, and ProMax&#x27;s Best Marketing Campaign of the Year Award. In March 2018, Noclip published the video documentary on the making of &quot;Warframe&quot;. The two-part feature tells the story of how &quot;Warframe&quot; succeeded as an independently developed and published game that changed the course of Digital Extremes.

Digital Extremes&#x27; employment environment has been recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s Top Employers for 2010, 2011, 2012 and through to 2018. Additionally, the company has been recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s top employers for Young People. In 2010 and 2011, the Financial Post named Digital Extremes one of the 10 best companies to work for in Canada.

On the provincial level, Digital Extremes received the Ontario Small Business Award in 2010. Digital Extremes was also presented with the Large Business of the Year award in 2011 from the London Chamber of Commerce. Digital Extremes was also awarded the Excellence in Human Resources award from The London Chamber of Commerce in early 2012.

<doc id="1166414" wikidata="Q323040" url="?curid=1166414" title="Blighted ovum">
<text>A blighted ovum is a pregnancy in which the embryo is reabsorbed or never develops at all. In a normal pregnancy, an embryo would be visible on an ultrasound by six weeks after the woman&#x27;s last menstrual period. Anembryonic gestation is one of the causes of miscarriage of a pregnancy and accounts for roughly half of first-trimester miscarriages. A blighted ovum cannot result in a viable pregnancy.

A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal-appearing gestational sac, but the absence of an embryo. It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast. When small, the sac cannot be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy, as there may be a yolk sac, though a fetal pole is not seen. In anembryonic pregnancy, levels of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) typically rise for a time, which can cause positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy symptoms such as tender breasts. Because of the presence of hCG, an ultrasound is typically necessary to diagnose an anembryonic pregnancy. For diagnosis, the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established. The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed. A transvaginal ultrasound provides a better view of early pregnancy than a transabdominal ultrasound. Generally, a transvaginal ultrasound is used to investigate a suspected case of blighted ovum. A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac, or an MGD &gt;25 mm with no embryo. A transabdominal ultrasound can be used to diagnose anembryonic pregnancy if a gestational sac can be identified, but is empty. An anembryonic pregnancy is never viable, as in viable pregnancy the embryo must form with the gestational sac.

<text>The FIFA World Cup official mascots are a series of characters for each World Cup event. The trend began with Willie in 1966 FIFA World Cup, one of the first mascots to be associated with a major sporting competition. The mascot designs represent a characteristic or symbol of the host country, such as flora, fauna, or costume. The design is frequently one or more anthropomorphic characters targeted at children and coinciding with cartoon shows and merchandise.

<text>Hessle () is a town and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, west of Kingston upon Hull. Geographically it is part of a larger urban area consisting of the city of Kingston upon Hull, the town of Hessle and a number of other villages but is not part of the city. It is on the north bank of the Humber Estuary where the Humber Bridge crosses.

According to the 2011 UK census, Hessle parish had a population of 15,000, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 14,767.

==Amenities==
The centre of Hessle is the Square. There are many shops and a small bus station, which was refitted in 2007. Hessle All Saints&#x27; Church is located just off the Square and was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Hessle Town Hall was built in 1897 and is situated at the top of South Lane. Hessle Police Station, which closed in 2014, is next door to the town hall at the top of South Lane and the corner of Ferriby Road.

Hessle is home to the world-famous Humber Bridge, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. At the time of its opening, the Humber Bridge was the world&#x27;s longest single-span suspension bridge. It links Hessle to the town of Barton-upon-Humber on the opposite side of the Humber estuary. In July 2017 the bridge was granted Grade I listed status.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Hessle&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Hase&quot;. It appears as &quot;Hesla&quot; in a Danelaw Charter from the reign of Henry II between 1154 and 1189, and as &quot;Hesel&quot; in a Yorkshire Charter of 1157, and in 1242 in the &quot;Book of Fees&quot;. The name is the Old Scandinavian &quot;hesli&quot; meaning &#x27;hazel grove&#x27;.

In more modern times, Hessle has been a centre for shipbuilding. Before 1897, there was a shipyard building wooden boats, but it was then bought by Henry Scarr who moved there from Beverley, where he had previously been in partnership with his brother Joseph. Scarr produced iron and steel ships until 1932, when the yard was taken over by Richard Dunston. It was the largest shipyard in Hessle, building vessels such as &quot;Loch Riddon&quot;, a roll-on/roll-off ferry launched in 1986, and one of four built for Caledonian MacBrayne for use in the Hebrides. The company went into liquidation in 1987 and was bought by Damen Shipyards Group in the same year. Dunston&#x27;s was closed down in 1994. The location is now used as offices, car sales buildings and a dock for scrap metal and other materials for dispatch to other areas, or to be recycled. Richard Dunston&#x27;s ship repairs still exists further east along the Humber Estuary, with activity remaining high.

==Geography==
Hessle is surrounded by the neighbouring villages of Willerby, Anlaby, Kirk Ella, West Ella, North Ferriby and Swanland.
Chalk-quarrying was a major industry at Hessle into the 20th century and quarries can still be seen in the west of the town, the largest being the Humber Bridge Country Park, which is a popular tourist attraction. Part of it is known as Little Switzerland (Little Switz or Switzy for short).

The Humber Bridge Country Park Local Nature Reserve was formerly a chalk quarry and was developed as a country park following the construction of the Humber Bridge. It consists of mixed species of woodland, wild flowers, a spring-fed pond and herb-rich grassland. The park can be explored on several well-signed walking routes.

Hessle is twinned with the French town of Bourg-de-Thizy.

Transport to and from Hessle is convenient, with good access to main roads such as the A15, A63 and M62 (via the A63). It also has a railway station with hourly services to and from Hull and to destinations such as Doncaster and York. Regular bus services provided by East Yorkshire link the town with the surrounding villages, Hull City Centre, Longhill Estate in east Hull as well as further afield places including Brough, Beverley and the seaside resort of Hornsea.

Hessle is at the start of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, a long-distance footpath and designated National Trail, which crosses the Yorkshire Wolds and ends at Filey on the North Sea Coast.

==Education==
The site of the town&#x27;s secondary school, Hessle High School &amp; Sixth Form College, on Heads Lane, is centred on a building donated to the Education Authority by Algernon Henry Barkworth, a survivor of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking. Hessle Sixth Form College is part of a consortium with secondary schools Wolfreton School (in Willerby) and Cottingham High School (in Cottingham), offering sixth form pupils a chance to attend classes at any of the three schools within the consortium. The entire school was reopened in January 2016, as part of Priority Schools Building Programme. Since January 2017, Penshurst Primary School and Hessle High School &amp; Sixth Form College have been a through-school.

Penshurst Primary School, for children aged 3–11, located on Winthorpe Road. Hessle is also home to All Saints&#x27; CE Federation of Academies Infant and Junior School, a Church of England school for children aged 3–11, located on Northolme Road.

==2007 floods==
On 25 June 2007, torrential rain hit the north-east of England and 100 mm of rain fell in a few hours. Several people died across the affected area and the first fatality occurred in Hessle. A 28-year-old man became trapped when his foot was stuck in a storm drain. He was overwhelmed by rising water and although emergency services gave him oxygen he died of hypothermia. Sky News filmed the operation and broadcast some of the footage in the days after the event. They were criticised for this but responded that the victim&#x27;s family had approved the broadcast.

The floods caused the formation of a local residents association, HCARA (Hessle Community Action Residents Association) who worked with various bodies to campaign for improvements in defences against floods in the lower Hessle area. The local MP, Alan Johnson, as well as representatives of the Environment Agency, East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Flood Forum were among the speakers at the resident meetings. HCARA, having operated to facilitate the distribution of news to Hessle residents immediately after the 2007 floods, is currently dormant.

As a result of consultation with the residents, the Environment Agency promoted a flood storage scheme which was constructed in a field off Beverley Road in Hessle from 2010 to 2011. The project known as a flood water attenuation scheme involved identifying a field immediately upstream of the urban area, this was then excavated below natural ground level to a depth of around . A flow control structure was built on the downstream end of the watercourse and the bank of the Western Drain was lowered on the West Side.

In a very heavy storm, when the capacity of the control structure is exceeded, water overflows into the storage area. After the storm, the (stored) water returns to the Western Drain through a small diameter land drainage pipe. The lagoon holds around 35,000 cubic metres of water. The storage area remains dry for the majority of the time and looks from the road side to be a paddock, albeit lower than surrounding fields.

==Hessle Feast==
Earliest found records of the Hessle Feast date from the 1800s. These have it as an annual event around Whitsuntide (May). A time of enjoyment, when the people of the parish would gather to celebrate the coming year.
From articles in 1808 and 1836, it is clear that the feast had become a major event bringing in people from neighbouring towns and villages. With much excitement, racing, noise and jubilee. As ever the youth made it their own. Even in the earliest reports, there are churchwardens concerns over noisy and drunken behaviour &quot;particularly of the young men of Hull&quot; who visited the parish.

Resurrected around 15 years ago, after many years of absence, the feast has again become an event of enjoyment and embraced by the whole community of Hessle.

Previous feasts include one which occurred in July 2006, which succeeded in attracting over 5,000 local residents and visitors to the area and was an entertaining day of charitable money raising, family fun and live music. The event hosted many activities such as a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; which took place on the main stage in the Square, a &quot;Buskathon&quot; centred down Prestongate, and local bands centred on a smaller stage on the Weir. There was also a boat race around the streets of Hessle, which was eventually won by army cadets carrying an inflatable float. The event was partly-funded and majorly sponsored by Kingston Communications and Yorkshire Water – companies working in the area at the time.

Hessle Feast returned, after a three-year absence due to the 2007 United Kingdom floods, in 2009. It was officially opened by the then Home Secretary, Hull West and Hessle MP, Alan Johnson, and the Mayor of Hessle, Frank Kitchen, at 1 p.m.

The feast day in 2009 entertained crowds over a larger area than previous feasts, to encourage more business to the less immediate areas of Hessle. In the Square, the main stage starred the &quot;Hessle&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; final and the &quot;Crave and Serenity Fashion Show&quot;. The Square&#x27;s stage was compared by KCFM DJ Dave Hudson. Prestongate had further stalls and barbecues. The Weir also had a stage with live music played all afternoon. On the feast day, a world record for &quot;poppadom stacking&quot; was broken on the Weir by the Indian takeaway Jolsha, officiated by the local MP Alan Johnson. Following on from the Weir is Tower Hill Park, which was mainly occupied by the army who had assault courses and climbing walls, which, as in previous years, focused on activities for the younger generations. The feast also reached the area near the library, which held a third stage with live local bands chosen by The Hase pub. The boat race was won by the youth sports team Norland Sharks, who were the fastest at running around Hessle carrying an inflatable boat. The Hessle Feast 2009 Committee was an independent body of unpaid volunteers that organised the event in the pubs of Hessle. The event was majorly sponsored by KCFM and Hull Colour Pages, with additional funding from the local town council.
The 2012 Hessle Feast was timed to take place on the Sunday of the weekend of celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in June 2012. The following day, a waterborne procession of sailing and powered craft departed from Hessle and proceeded around the Humber estuary.

==Sport==
The most popular sport in Hessle is football. Hessle is home to three senior football clubs, Hessle Rangers, Hessle United, and Hessle Sporting, the latter of which plays in the Humber Premier League &quot;Premier Division&quot; – level 13 on the English football league system pyramid. The clubs also have a large section of junior teams playing in the Hull Boys Sunday Football League. Also, there is a cricket team and a rugby team at the Hessle rugby club near the foreshore.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Capital Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; Northern Lincolnshire, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire and Nation Radio East Yorkshire. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot;.

<text>General Chang is the main antagonist in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, a feature film released in 1991.

Chang, who is portrayed by [[Christopher Plummer]], is Chancellor Gorkon&#x27;s chief of staff and subsequently serves Chancellor Azetbur in 2293. He is depicted as being a fan of William Shakespeare, quoting him frequently, much to the chagrin of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew. Also noteworthy, the character is almost completely bald, a trait not seen among Klingons before the release of &quot;Star Trek VI&quot;.

Plummer&#x27;s depiction of this character has been praised in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

==Overview==

In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, Chang is a well-known Klingon general who believes that &quot;in space all warriors are cold warriors.&quot; Throughout the film he is often depicted as fierce, cunning and willing to participate in battles personally. Chang has a deep-seated hatred for the United Federation of Planets and believes that a war with them is inevitable.

As a result, in the events described in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon Academy&quot;, he creates a simulated campaign against the Federation and uses it to train students at an Academy for future starship commanders. This hatred eventually leads him to participate in a conspiracy to thwart plans for a lasting peace between his people and the Federation.

==Development==

Chang&#x27;s makeup originally included a wig appliance. However, Christopher Plummer felt removing the wig made the character more distinct. He also asked that Chang&#x27;s Klingon makeup be made less severe. Chang&#x27;s attire is unique in that an apparent eye injury is disguised with a metal eyepatch, which is attached directly to his skull by bolts bearing the Klingon emblem. Later depictions of Klingons with eye injuries, such as &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s Martok, had them flaunting their mutilations as battle scars.

== Reception ==
In 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Chang the ninth-best villain of the Star Trek franchise, praising the performance of actor Christopher Plummer.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine rated General Chang the second-best villain of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in 2016. In 2019, SyFy rated General Chang as the eighth-greatest Klingon of the Star Trek franchise, noting Plummer&#x27;s brilliant delivery of lines as well as an exceptional Klingon court scene with Captain Kirk (played by William Shatner) and Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley).

Plummer reprised the role in the computer game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon Academy&quot; (2000), where Chang gives the player&#x27;s missions Shakespearean names.

<doc id="1166445" wikidata="Q6820176" url="?curid=1166445" title="Merrill College">
<text>Merrill College is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The theme of the college, and the name of its freshman core course, is &quot;cultural identities and global consciousness.&quot;

==Location==
Merrill is located at the far northeastern corner of the University of California, Santa Cruz campus, east of Crown College and north of Cowell and Stevenson colleges. The college sits at the top of a hill and can only be reached by steep access roads and pedestrian paths. The grounds cover approximately nine acres of land (the smallest of the residential colleges) covered largely by tall redwood trees.

==History==
Merrill was founded in 1968 as the fourth college at UCSC. The college takes its name from Charles E. Merrill Jr., former Headmaster of the Commonwealth School in Boston. In 1968, Merrill was the chairman of the Charles E. Merrill Trust, named for his father, Charles E. Merrill, Sr., the founder of Merrill Lynch. It was in this year that the Trust elected to donate funds for the construction of the hitherto-named College Four at Santa Cruz.

The first three colleges at UCSC all had clearly identified academic specialties before their founding: Cowell in the humanities, Stevenson in the social sciences, and Crown in the natural sciences. However, Merrill allowed its early faculty and students to determine its theme. The college originally intended to focus on international studies, but an early shift towards global poverty led to its eventual emphasis on the developing countries and their cultures, as well as the impact of the United States in the developing world.

With a progressive theme, Merrill quickly attracted liberal and radical faculty and students. It offered ethnic studies classes as well as student housing with ethnic studies emphases, and attracted progressive visitors, including Herbert Marcuse in 1975. Merrill also gained a reputation as a campus center of openness and acceptance for gays and lesbians; in 1991 it established the Vito Russo House in one of its student residences.

In 2003, as part of a campus-wide food service consolidation program, the Merrill dining hall closed and was converted into a multi-use space, called the Merrill Cultural Center. In 2006, the History Department, and many affiliated faculty, left their longtime home at Merrill for the new Humanities Building next to Cowell College.

In 2014, Merrill College was renovated, updating the dorms to fire code standards and was remodeled.

==Architecture and buildings==

The San Francisco architectural firm Campbell and Wong designed the buildings at Merrill College. Most of the original structures were completed by 1970. The Crown-Merrill Apartments were added in 1986.

Unlike the first colleges, Merrill does not consist of Bay Regionalist or Mediterranean buildings centered around formal quads. Instead, its structures present three key features: starkly modern and Scandinavian design, orientation around the redwood trees that once were the focal point of the site (removed in Spring 2013 for a redesign), and playfully historical components such as the bridges to the residential towers, balconies with lattice railings, and the bell tower above the dining hall. The college hosts a range of colors, rust red and off-white residence halls. Merrill prominently features blue metal roofs for nearly every building, with the exception of the two main residence towers.

The Merrill circle, at the top of a driveway off McLaughlin Drive, is the formal entrance to the college. The college office and the academic buildings, with faculty offices, seminar rooms, and a lecture hall, are immediately behind the circle. Just below the main Academic Building are three smaller buildings. One contains the Charles E. Merrill Lounge, another is an annex of faculty offices and home to the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; and lastly, the Casa Latina.

The college activities office and Vivas Mexican Food, a Mexican restaurant based in midtown Santa Cruz, are in a small building at the center of the college, adjacent to a small courtyard in front of the former dining hall.

Merrill has four primary residence halls. Lorde-Studds, Kochiyama, Bulosan and Gandhi-Kahlo House (usually referred to as &quot;A Dorm&quot; and &quot;B Dorm&quot; respectively) are in two large, five-story buildings that close a loose square with the dining hall and academic buildings. Two smaller houses, Chavez-Menchu and DuBois (C and D), are located to the East of the college circle and Ming Ong computer lab.

Near the college are buildings housing the Lionel Cantú GLBTI Resource Center, KZSC radio, and the campus Peace Corps office. The Crown-Merrill apartments are located across a ravine from the main college.

Most Merrill freshmen reside in the residence halls, with most sophomores in the college apartments. Upper-division students generally live off-campus.

There is also the Merrill and Alan Chadwick gardens on Garden Ct.

Beginning Spring of 2013, a major redesign of the Merrill quad and residence halls was underway. The first stages of the construction involved the removal of dozens of redwood trees that had formerly given the location is distinctively sylvan quality.

==Academic emphases==
Merrill remains a campus center for studies of the developing world and cultural studies. Its freshman core course includes readings by authors from Cuba, Morocco, inner-city Los Angeles, and most recently Darfur.

In particular, it houses many faculty in Spanish language and Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS). Both the LALS academic offices and the Casa Latina library and resource center are housed in the Merrill academic buildings.

Merrill College also houses the faculty and administrative offices of the Politics Department and the Legal Studies Program.

==Core course==
The core course is called &quot;Cultural Identities and Global Consciousness&quot; (MERR 80A, 80B). It is one quarter long and students read around four novels, usually memoirs, one of which is replaced every year by a new one.

==Programs==
Merrill has the only pottery co-op in the Santa Cruz colleges. It also offers opportunities to volunteer in local elementary schools. Merrill is home to the Merrill Student Government (MSG): one of the most active student governments at UCSC, the Merrill Activities Council: a group for students to come together and plan programs and events for the Merrill Community, and annually hosts the most highly attended dances on the UCSC campus including &quot;Moat Jam&quot; (the kickoff dance for each academic year), the annual Halloween Dance and &quot;Glitterball&quot; (the kickoff to the Universities month of LGBT pride events)

==Traditions==
The Merrill moat, created by a retaining wall adjacent to the large college dormitories, features murals by Merrill students. Every spring, Merrill students decide which murals should remain and which should be painted over with new artwork. After the new murals are chosen, students gather on a weekend to help paint the new murals at an event called Merrill Moat Day. Along with painting over the old murals and starting the new ones, the even includes activities put on by the RA&#x27;s (Residential Assistants) and a barbecue for Merrill Students. In the past, activities like henna tattoos, tie dyeing t-shirts, and other arts and crafts have been featured. Merrill also hosts a campus-wide dance in the moat at the beginning of each academic year, called Moat Jam. It usually takes place on the Sunday evening of Welcome Week.

<doc id="1166454" wikidata="Q4081473" url="?curid=1166454" title="BelOMO">
<text>BelOMO or Belorusskoe Optiko-Mechanichesckoye Obyedinenie (Беломо or Белорусское оптико-механическое объединение, Belarus Optical &amp; Mechanical Association) was founded in Minsk in 1971 in Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union, now Belarus. The main factory is the &quot;Minskiy Mechanichesckiy Zavod imeni S.I. Vavilova&quot;, opened in Minsk 1957 and named after the Soviet physicist Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov (1891–1951).

At first, BelOMO made photographic equipment and lens-making machinery for state use. It now manufactures a wide range of products, including military and consumer optical products. During the 1980s it produced the Agat-18 and Agat-18K half-frame 35mm cameras, still popular among Lomographic photographers.

A joint venture with German optics maker Zeiss was begun in 1995 and ended 2023/24. The firm produces lenses and optical elements for microscopes and other optical equipment with ISO 9001 certification.

MMZ—BelOMO factory estimates its global market share in optical sights, rangefinders and NVDs at 2-3%, with 10% of Russian market and 80% of local market. The factory also produces gas meters, car units, infra-red emitters, juicers and other civil products.

== International sanctions ==
In 2022, BelOMO was blacklisted by the European Union, the US, Switzerland and Japan, in response to Belarus&#x27;s enabling of and support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In May 2023, Ukraine imposed sanctions against several BelOMO subsidiaries On July 1, 2023, Ukraine further blacklisted the CEO of BelOMO Alexander Moroz, the director of the STC &quot;LEMT&quot; Alexey Shkadarevich and several enterprises of the association. In August 2023, BelOMO was also blacklisted by Canada and the United Kingdom. On December 5, 2023, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has added BelOMO, LEMT BelOMO and Zenit BelOMO, another BelOMO subsidiary, as well as their Directors general, Moroz, Shkadarevich and Gaichuk, to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.

In April 2024, Dzmitry Mikhaltsou, the technical director of the Vavilov Plant, was also added to the SDN list. In June 2024, BelOMO, Moroz, LEMT BelOMO and JSC Zenit BelOMO were added to the European Union&#x27;s sanctions list. In July, Switzerland, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Ukraine joined these sanctions; New Zealand blacklisted BelOMO and Moroz in September. On August 23, 2024, the United States announced sanctions against yet another BelOMO subsidiary, the Diaproektor plant, as well as its director and two deputy directors.

Following sanctions, BelOMO has obtained parts and supplies from several Chinese companies.

<text>Linaro DDT is a commercial C, C++ and Fortran 90 debugger. It is widely used for debugging parallel Message Passing Interface (MPI) and threaded (pthread or OpenMP) programs, including those running on clusters of Linux machines.

==Debugger==
It is used to find bugs on both small and large clusters, from 1 to 100,000s of processors. It features memory debugging which detect memory leaks, or reading and writing beyond the bounds of arrays.

It was the first debugger to be able to debug petascale applications - having been used to debug applications running concurrently on 220,000 processes on a Cray XT5 at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. This is possible interactively as the debugger&#x27;s control tree architecture leads to logarithmic performance for most collective operations. Linaro DDT uses the GNU Debugger as debug engine.

Linaro DDT also supports coprocessor architectures such as Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and Nvidia CUDA GPUs.

It is part of Linaro Forge - a suite of tools for developing code in high performance computing - which also includes the performance profiler for scalar, multithreaded and parallel codes - Linaro MAP.

, 80 percent of the world&#x27;s top 25 supercomputers on the TOP500 list, use Arm&#x27;s tools.

<text>Oakes College is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is on the southwestern corner of the campus, south of Rachel Carson College and east of the Family Student Housing complex.

Oakes was founded in 1972 as College Seven by Professors Herman J. Blake and Ralph C. Guzmán. In 1968, the Black Liberation Front, a black power group, demanded an all-black college. Blake, UCSC&#x27;s only African American faculty member at the time, along with Guzmán, one of the few Mexican-American faculty on campus, proposed a compromise in which College Seven&#x27;s academic program would focus on ethnic studies, particularly the studies of minority groups in California. Though the term &quot;ethnic studies&quot; was dropped in the planning phases, the college has always stressed racial, ethnic and cultural diversity, along with the representation and support of students from historically disadvantaged groups. 

Oakes is perceived by some students as a &quot;minority college&quot;, partly due to its roots in radical elements of the Civil Rights Movement. Comparative racial and ethnic statistics do show that Oakes&#x27; student body has slightly higher percentages of minorities than a number of other UCSC colleges and UCSC&#x27;s student body as a whole. For example, 9.8% of Oakes&#x27;s students are African American and 12.2% are Filipino American, compared with 2.7% and 4.5%, respectively, among UCSC&#x27;s general student body.

College Seven was renamed Oakes in 1975 after philanthropists Roscoe and Margaret Oakes, whose endowment contributed significantly to the founding of the college. 

Noted political activist Angela Davis, an Oakes affiliate,

is a professor of history of consciousness, an unconventional program centering on the history of struggles for racial, economic and social justice and equality.

== Theme housing ==

Oakes College provides theme housing for their students that want to live on campus. There are four dormitory buildings and four apartment blocks.

===Dormitory buildings===
&quot;Biko House&quot; – African American theme and STEM Community

<text>Alexis Cruz (born September 29, 1974) is an American actor, known for his performances as Rafael in &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and as Skaara in &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==Biography==
Cruz was born in The Bronx of Puerto Rican descent. His mother, Julia, was a songwriter. He currently resides in Los Angeles. He started his acting career when he was 9. However, when he was 13, and was auditioning for a role, the director explained to him that he was a bad actor, so Cruz decided to enter The School of Performing Arts that same year.

Cruz appeared as assistant D.A. Martin Allende in the legal drama &quot;Shark&quot;, with co-stars James Woods and Jeri Ryan. In the 1998 film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot;, Cruz played the role of Herman Santiago, one of the original members of the rock and roll group The Teenagers. Along with Erick Avari and Richard Kind, he is one of only three actors to appear in both the original &quot;Stargate&quot; film and the continuing TV series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and Stargate Atlantis.

<doc id="1166477" wikidata="Q4982218" url="?curid=1166477" title="Bubble Yum">
<text>Bubble Yum is a brand of bubble gum marketed by The Hershey Company. It was first sold by Life Savers in test markets in the Western U.S. in 1974. National distribution began in 1976.

== History ==
In 1977, rumors began to spread that the gum&#x27;s soft, chewable secret was the addition of spider eggs. The Life Savers Company addressed the issue with an official full-page rebuttal printed in prominent U.S. newspapers (including &quot;The New York Times&quot;), to dispel the rumor and restore public confidence. Sales of the gum soon surpassed sales of Life Savers candy, and it became the most popular bubble gum brand. Nabisco bought Life Savers in 1981, and The Hershey Company acquired the Bubble Yum brand in 2000.

== Mascot ==
Bubble Yum&#x27;s official mascot is Floyd D. Duck, an anthropomorphic punk-style duck character.

<text>Søren Kragh-Jacobsen (; born 2 March 1947, in Copenhagen) is a Danish film director, musician, and songwriter.

He was one of the founders and practitioners of the Dogme95 project, for creating films without artificial technology or techniques.

== Early career ==
Kragh-Jacobsen started out as a popular musician in Denmark, before attending film school in Prague. After returning to Denmark, he directed and co-wrote television productions.

He became one of the developers of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; film-making project Dogme95, based on creating films based only on reality, without artificial lighting and technology.

== Career ==
His first feature film was &quot;Wanna See My Beautiful Navel?&quot; (1978). This was followed by the successful &quot;Rubber Tarzan&quot; (1981), &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1983), &quot;Emma&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1988), &quot;Shower of Gold&quot; (1988), &quot;The Boys from St. Petri&quot; (1991), &quot;The Island on Bird Street&quot; (1997), and his international break-through, dogme No. 3 &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot; (1999), and &quot;Skagerrak&quot; (2003). &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot; won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;Skagerrak&quot; was entered into the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. He has done some commercials and Danish/Swedish TV series.

Acclaimed internationally, he has received several major awards for his work, including the Memorial François Truffaut Award/Giffoni, an Emmy for &quot;The Island on Bird Street&quot; and a Silver Bear at the Berlinale film festival in Berlin for &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot;. &quot;The Boys from St. Petri&quot; was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>LOMO () is a manufacturer of medical and motion-picture lenses and equipment based in St. Petersburg, Russia. The company was awarded three Order of Lenin decorations by the Soviet Union.

Its Lomo LC-A consumer camera was the inspiration for the lomography photographic movement.

==History==

The company was founded in 1914 in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). It was established as a French – Russian limited company to produce lenses and cameras. It manufactured gun sights during World War I. In 1919, it was nationalised. In 1921, the factory was named the Factory of State Optics, G.O.Z. In 1925, camera production was resumed, and several lens designs tested between 1925 and 1929. Further reorganisations of the Soviet optical factories in several stages finally resulted in that the factory at Leningrad became GOMZ, the Russian Optical and Mechanical Factory.

In the transition period 1932 to 1935 a copy of the Leica camera was developed, the VOOMP I. Today LOMO makes military optics, scientific research instruments, criminological microscopes, medical equipment, and a range of consumer products. 

Known as GOMZ (State Optical-Mechanical Plant), the company was transformed under the direction of Mikhail Panfilov, who united several industries and founded the LOMO Association in 1962. In 1990 - 1997 Ilya Klebanov was the Director General of LOMO Association.

The company went public in 1993, and was renamed LOMO PLC; it is traded on the RTS Classic Stock Market. The company is ISO 9001 certified and exports worldwide. Night-vision devices and telescopes account for 30% of the company&#x27;s exports. Germany is the largest importer of LOMO products. Medical equipment, fiber optic cables and endoscopes, optical components and cameras are consumed mainly by the Russian market and other states of the former Soviet Union. Military equipment and science research instruments make a significant share of production for export to such countries as Israel, India, United States, Canada, Mexico, and other international markets.

<text>Rachel Carson College is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Named in honor of conservationist Rachel Carson, it is on the west side of campus, north of Oakes College and southeast of Porter College. The current provost of the college is Professor Sue Carter, also a faculty member of UCSC&#x27;s Physics Department. The theme of its freshman core course is &quot;Environment and Society&quot;.

==History==
Rachel Carson College was founded in 1972 as College Eight at the current location of the Kerr Hall lecture building. Before it moved to its present location in 1990, College Eight was the only UCSC college that did not have its own on-campus housing; residential students were then housed at the Porter College residence halls. At the time, its focus was on transfer students, who are usually less likely to live on campus than students on a traditional four-year course.

 On September 15, 2016, it was announced that the former College Eight would be named Rachel Carson College, with the help of an endowment from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.

==Freshman core class==
Rachel Carson College&#x27;s freshman core class, &quot;Environment and Society&quot;, &quot;examines education, identity, nature, community, livelihood, and livability at local and national levels as contemporary global transformations affect them.&quot; (All Rachel Carson College freshmen must take it, but transfer students are exempt if they have more than 45 credits.) The course has been expanded to a year, the first quarter being an overview of environmental issues with an emphasis on social sciences and environmental justice, the second providing a strong grounding in biological and atmospheric issues (along with empirical and quantitative methods), and the final course emphasizes creative hands-on solutions, particularly in terms of energy issues. These provide the foundation for a new social entrepreneur initiative.

<text>College Nine is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The university&#x27;s first new college in nearly 30 years, College Nine was founded in 2000 although the dorms were not finished until 2002. It is located on the north side of campus, east of Science Hill and west of Crown College. The college theme is &quot;International and Global Perspectives&quot;. All freshmen students are required to take a core course on this particular theme.

College Nine is composed of three residence halls (R1, R2, and R3); in the spring of 2006 the residence halls were renamed to emphasize and reflect the college&#x27;s theme. As of Fall 2006, the new residence hall names are Hague House, Gandhi House, and Geneva House. These names however are temporary names and are subject to change once the college finds a benefactor. 

In the LRDP (Long Range Development Plan) for UCSC, Colleges 9 and John R. Lewis will be situated as the very center of UCSC by 2025.

College Nine is also home to the International Living Center (ILC). The ILC is home to nearly a third of international students visiting UCSC while on study abroad and provides a space where international, transfer and domestic students coexist in apartment-style living. There also exists three International RAs as well as its own Coordinator for Residential Education.

<text>John R. Lewis College, formerly known as College Ten, is one of the ten residential colleges at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is on the north side of campus, west of College Nine and north of the Cowell Student Health Center. The theme of its freshman core course is &quot;Social Justice and Community&quot;.

John R. Lewis College is home to the University Center, a conference center located above the Dining Commons, and the Terry Freitas cafe, a student-run co-op cafe named after UCSC-alumni Terry Freitas, who was murdered in Colombia due to his work with the U&#x27;wa people to stop oil companies from drilling on U&#x27;wa land.

In 2010, students and staff worked together to name the three residential halls. They are called Angela Davis House, after the American political activist and UCSC professor, Angela Davis; Ohlone House, after the native Ohlone people who are indigenous to the region; and Amnesty House, after Amnesty International and their work for human rights.

John R. Lewis College was founded in 2002 as &quot;College Ten&quot;, making it the newest UCSC college as of May 2017. On October 27, 2021, Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced that the university will be renaming College Ten after civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis. The name change was made official in Spring 2022.

<doc id="1166496" wikidata="Q1426965" url="?curid=1166496" title="St Mary's Abbey, York">
<text>The Abbey of St Mary is a ruined Benedictine abbey in York, England and a scheduled monument.

==History==
Once one of the most prosperous abbeys in Northern England, its remains lie in what are now the York Museum Gardens, on a steeply-sloping site to the west of York Minster.

The original church on the site was founded in 1055 and dedicated to Saint Olaf. After the Norman Conquest the church came into the possession of the Anglo-Breton magnate Alan Rufus who granted the lands to Abbot Stephen and a group of monks from Whitby. The abbey church was refounded in 1088 when the King, William Rufus, visited York in January or February of that year and gave the monks additional lands. The following year he laid the foundation stone of the new Norman church and the site was rededicated to the Virgin Mary. The foundation ceremony was attended by bishop Odo of Bayeux and Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux. The monks moved to York from a site at Lastingham in Ryedale in the 1080s and are recorded there in the Domesday Book of 1086. Following a dispute and riot in 1132, a party of reform-minded monks left to establish the Cistercian monastery of Fountains Abbey. In 1137 the abbey was badly damaged by a great fire. The surviving ruins date from a rebuilding programme begun in 1271 and finished by 1294.
===Precinct===
The abbey occupied an extensive precinct site immediately outside the city walls, between Bootham and the River Ouse. The original boundary included a ditch and a narrow strip of ground, but the walled circuit was constructed above this in the 1260s in the Abbacy of Simon de Warwick; the walls were nearly three-quarters of a mile long. In 1318 the abbot received royal permission to raise the height of the wall and crenellate it; a stretch of this wall still runs along Bootham and Marygate to the River Ouse.

The gatehouse in Marygate and its lodge formed part of a range of buildings that linked to the older church of St Olave by a chapel dedicated to Mary. Though work on the chapel and gatehouse was under way 1314 and completed in 1320, the surviving structures are mostly of fifteenth-century origin.

St Mary&#x27;s Tower is a structure at the corner of Marygate and Bootham.

===Abbey Church===
The abbey church is aligned northeast–southwest, due to restrictions of the site. The original Norman church had an apsidal liturgical east end, and its side aisles ended in apses, though they were square on the exterior. Rebuilding began in 1270, under the direction of Abbot Simon de Warwick, and was swiftly completed during a single twenty-four year building campaign, such was the financial strength of the abbey. The completed abbey church was in length, consisted of a nave with aisles, north and south transepts with chapels in an eastern aisle, and a presbytery with aisles. To the east of the cloister and on the line of the transepts were a vestibule leading to the chapter house, the scriptorium and library. Beyond the church lay the kitchen, novices&#x27; building and infirmary. The Abbey chronicle (which has not been fully translated from Latin) names the project officers as Simon de Warwick, a monk administrator and the master stonemason Master Simon, all of whom were still alive upon the completion of the project in 1294.

===The Abbot&#x27;s House===

The abbot&#x27;s house, built of brick in 1483, survives as the King&#x27;s Manor because it became the seat of the Council of the North in 1539; the abbots of St Mary&#x27;s and the abbey featured in the medieval and early modern ballads of Robin Hood, with the abbot usually as Robin Hood&#x27;s nemesis.

In August 1513 the Abbot supplied four chests for the use of Philip Tilney, treasurer of the English army before the Battle of Flodden. The Abbey seems to have become the accounting office for the army in the north, involving Thomas Magnus, Archdeacon of the East Riding, and two monks of the abbey, Richard Wode and Richard Rypon.

===The Dissolution===

St Mary&#x27;s, the largest and richest Benedictine establishment in the north of England and one of the largest landholders in Yorkshire, was worth over £2,000 a year, (), when it was valued in 1539, during the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII; it was closed and subsequently substantially destroyed. On 26 November 1539 the Abbey surrendered £2,085 and 50 monks to the Crown.

===Library===
A fifteenth-century index catalogue records that the Abbey&#x27;s library originally contained over 750 books. Approximately thirty-five texts from the Abbey are currently extant, including only five printed books; these include a 15th-century copy of Richard Rolle&#x27;s &quot;Incendium Amoris&quot;.

====Brother Grayson&#x27;s Bible====
A Vulgate Bible, sold at auction in England in 2010, has been identified as the possession of Brother John Grayson from St Mary&#x27;s Abbey. It is an octavo volume and was printed on 8 November 1526 by Thielmann Kerver in Paris. Brother Grayson was first noted at the Abbey in 1528 but was absent from its pension list at the time of the Dissolution in 1539.

====The Anonimalle Chronicle====
&quot;The Anonimalle Chronicle&quot; is an important chronicle whose scope extends from the legendary Brutus to 1381. It was composed in Anglo-Norman by an anonymous monk of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey towards the end of the 14th century. It includes the most detailed surviving description of a medieval parliament and a well-informed account of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381; these are likely to have been written by eyewitnesses and later incorporated into the chronicle. The body of the chronicle from Brutus to the year 1307 has been described as a variant of the &quot;Brut&quot; Chronicle, but there are considerable differences (e.g. the chronicler shows an interest in early ecclesiastical history which the &quot;Brut&quot; does not). From 1307 to 1333 it follows the main &quot;Brut&quot; tradition more closely though it demonstrates a marked London interest. After 1333 the chronicle is an individual account probably drawing on sources originating in London. The manuscript was known to the 16th-century antiquaries Francis Thynne and John Stow; its title derives from Thynne&#x27;s description of it. It afterwards passed through the hands of various owners until it was found in the possession of the Ingilby family of Ripley Castle in 1920. The section from 1333 to 1381 was edited by V. H. Galbraith and published in 1927. In 1982 it was acquired by the Brotherton Collection, at the University of Leeds. Another partial edition appeared in 1991 in the form of an edition and translation of the chronicle from 1307 to 1334 by Wendy Childs and John Taylor.

==Excavations in the Abbey precinct==

The Yorkshire Museum, built for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, stands in part of the abbey cloister; parts of the east, south and west cloister walls were temporarily excavated in 1827–29 preparatory to digging the museum&#x27;s foundations. The relationship between the Museum and abbey is historically quite intimate as part of the richly carved chapter house vestibule (–1307) survives incorporated into Tempest Anderson Hall lecture theatre (1911–12). These walls and part of the warming house are retained in the Museum as part of the Medieval gallery display.

Excavations of the chapter house were undertaken in 1912 by the honorary curator of Medieval archaeology, Walter Harvey-Brook who, along with E. Ridsdale Tate designed and developed the Museum of Medieval Architecture on the site.

Further excavations in the abbey were undertaken in 1952–56 by the then Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum, George Willmot who encountered the pre-Norman and Roman layers beneath the west wing of the nave.

Excavations in 2014 and 2015 discovered an apse in the south transept, large parts of the wall foundations, and numerous residual small finds dating from the Roman to Modern periods. These investigations also encountered fragments of human remains, disturbed from burials somewhere on the site. One of the major conclusions of these excavations was the prevalence of in situ archaeological remains at a very shallow depth beneath the modern ground surface; in some cases as little as 7 cm underground.

===Figure of Jesus Christ===
A 13th-century gilt, Limoges enamel figurine depicting Christ (the St Mary&#x27;s Abbey Figurine) was discovered in the Abbey in 1826, having avoided the dissolution of the monastery in 1539. It disappeared soon afterwards, and was thought by some to have been destroyed, only to be discovered in a private art collection in Germany in the 1920s. In 2019, the statue was bought by York Museums Trust and put on display in Yorkshire Museum.

==Abbots of St. Mary&#x27;s==
The abbots of St. Mary&#x27;s were entitled to wear a mitre and were habitually summoned to Parliament. In total there are known to have been some 30 Abbots, including:

==Burials==
*Stephen, Count of Tréguier
*Abbot Thomas Spofforth.
*William de Vescy of Kildare

==Remains==
All that remains today are the north and west walls, plus a few other remnants: the half-timbered Pilgrims&#x27; &quot;Hospitium&quot;, the West Gate and the 14th-century timber-framed Abbot&#x27;s House (now called the King&#x27;s Manor). The walls include interval towers along the north and west stretches, St Mary&#x27;s Tower at the northwest corner, and a polygonal water tower by the river. Much stone was removed from the site in the 18th century, in 1705 for St. Olave&#x27;s Church, between 1717 and 1720 for Beverley Minster, and in 1736 for the landing stage of Lendal Ferry.

The remains of the Abbey were described by E. Ridsdale Tate in a 1929 publication in which he asserted that: 
&quot;Nowhere in England is there another spot so full of charm as York and where in York is there a more charming spot than the Gardens of the Philosophical Society, in which stand the beautiful fragments of that once powerful and noble monastery of St. Mary&#x27;s. Here we must leave the venerable pile in the evening of its glory.&quot;

<text>Mifune (, &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot;) is a 1999 romantic comedy film, starring Iben Hjejle and Anders W. Berthelsen. Directed by Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, it was the third film made according to the Dogme 95 group rules. The film was a great success in Denmark and an international blockbuster, ranked among the ten best-selling Danish films worldwide. It was produced by Nimbus Film.

At the 49th Berlin International Film Festival, the film won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize and Iben Hjejle won an Honourable Mention. It was the Danish submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards, but was not nominated among the finalists. 

== Plot ==
Kresten had moved from his parents&#x27; farm on Lolland, an out-of-the-way small Danish island, to Copenhagen to pursue his career. When his father dies, he has to move back to the farm where not much has happened since he left. He places an ad in the local newspaper to get help run the farm. He has to support his brother Rud who needs special care. Kresten has entertained Rud by imitating the noted late Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune, featured as a samurai. The prostitute Liva who is running away from harassing telephone calls, answers the ad.

== Title ==
The title of the film is a reference to the late Toshiro Mifune (1920–1997), a prolific Japanese film actor whose roles included that of Kikuchiyo, one of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. It also refers to Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson&#x27;s poem &quot;Sidste Sang&quot; (1870, Last Song).

==Reception and awards==
The romantic comedy was immensely popular, ranked as the seventh-highest grossing film of the year in Denmark, with admissions of 351,000.

It was screened at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival, where the film won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize and Iben Hjejle won an Honourable Mention. Denmark selected this film as its submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards, but it did not make the final list of nominees. 

== Confession ==
The Dogme 95 group established rigid rules to govern their &#x27;chastity&#x27; in filmmaking. Thomas Vinterberg, in the first Dogme 95 film, went further: make a confession if elements of the film do not comply with the Dogme-rules. The confession is written from the director&#x27;s point of view.

Kragh-Jacobsen published his confession about &quot;Mifune&quot;:
As one of the DOGME 95 brethren and co-signatory of the Vow of Chastity I feel moved to confess to the following transgressions of the aforesaid Vow during the production of Dogme 3 – Mifune. Please note that the film has been approved as a Dogme work, as only one genuine breach of the rules has actually taken place. The rest may be regarded as moral breaches.
* I confess to having made one take with a black drape covering a window. This is not only the addition of a property, but must also be regarded as a kind of lighting arrangement.
* I confess to moving furniture and fittings around the house.
* I confess to having taken with me a number of albums of my favourite comic book series as a youth, &quot;Linda &amp; Valentin&quot; (&quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot;).
* I confess to helping to chase the neighbour&#x27;s free-range hens across our location and including them in the film.
* I confess that I brought a photographic image from an old lady from the area and hung it in a prominent position in one scene: not as part of the plot, but more as a selfish, spontaneous, pleasureable whim.
* I confess to borrowing a hydraulic platform from a painter, which we used for the only two bird&#x27;s-eye overview shots in the film.
* I do solemnly declare that in my presence the remainder of Dogme 3 – Mifune was produced in accordance with the vow of chastity.
* I also point out that the film has been approved by DOGME 95 as a Dogme film, as in real terms no more than a single breach of the rules has been committed. The rest may be regarded as moral transgressions.

<doc id="1166506" wikidata="Q1088707" url="?curid=1166506" title="Warrel Dane">
<text>Warrel Dane (; born Warrel George Baker; March 7, 1961 – December 13, 2017) was an American musician and the lead singer for the heavy metal bands Sanctuary and Nevermore. He was a natural baritone; though he was initially known for his high-pitched vocals with Serpent&#x27;s Knight and on the first two Sanctuary albums. Later in his career, Dane became more recognized for his distinctively deep, dramatic voice.

== Career ==

Dane trained as an opera singer for five years and developed a broad vocal range, spanning from notes as low as G♯ below low C, or G♯1, to notes as high as the B♭ below soprano C, or B♭5. While his high head voice vocals were more prominent in the earlier Sanctuary albums, he occasionally employed them in his work with Nevermore as well. Sanctuary&#x27;s 2014 comeback album, &quot;The Year the Sun Died&quot;, features these higher passages on three songs.

Dane provided the voice of Candynose Twinskins in the musical comedy &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; on Adult Swim.

Dane&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Praises to the War Machine&quot;, was released on May 13, 2008, by Century Media Records. At the time of his death, he was working on a second album, which he stated would differ from his first solo effort: &quot;Some of it is just brutally heavy&quot;, Dane said. In March 2016, the title of the album was revealed to be &quot;Shadow Work&quot;. The recording session was initially scheduled for October 2016.

== Influences ==
Dane&#x27;s musical influences included Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Jefferson Airplane, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Beatles, and The Doors, while his primary vocal inspirations were Ronnie James Dio, Rob Halford, George Strait, and Bruce Dickinson.

== Death ==
On December 13, 2017, it was reported that Dane had died of a heart attack in São Paulo, Brazil, at the age of 56. He had been working there on his second solo album, &quot;Shadow Work&quot;. Johnny Moraes, the guitarist in Dane&#x27;s solo band, stated, &quot;He died in the night. He had a heart attack. He was in the apartment where he stayed during the recording of the album when it happened. I gave him cardiac massage, and we called the Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU), who came very fast, but when they arrived, he was already dead.&quot; Moraes mentioned that Dane had been dealing with numerous health issues, including a history of alcohol abuse and type 2 diabetes.

== Legacy ==
On January 14, 2018, one month after Dane&#x27;s death, Brazilian movie director Daney Carvalho released his debut short film, &quot;O Ano em que o Sol Morreu&quot; (a reference to the title of the Sanctuary album &quot;The Year the Sun Died&quot;), a drama and tribute to Dane, on YouTube. The movie was originally released in May 2016 as part of a Brazilian festival, but Carvalho decided to make it publicly available after Dane&#x27;s death. Dane met Carvalho that year, when the independent director interviewed him for a local Brazilian TV program during college. According to Carvalho, Dane was given a private screening of the movie after post-production was completed and described it as &quot;great&quot; and &quot;terrifying&quot;.

<doc id="1166508" wikidata="Q36537" url="?curid=1166508" title="Tagoi language">
<text>The Tagoi language is a Kordofanian language, closely related to Tegali, spoken near the town of Rashad in southern Kordofan in Sudan, about 12 N, 31 E. Unlike Tegali, it has a complex noun class system, which appears to have been borrowed from more typical Niger–Congo languages. It has several dialects, including Umali (Tumale), Goy (Tagoi proper), Moreb, and Orig (, Turjuk). Villages are Moreb, Tagoi, Tukum, Tuling, Tumale, Turjok, and Turum (&quot;Ethnologue&quot;, 22nd edition).

The following describes the Orig dialect.

==Phonology==
The consonants are:

Stops are automatically voiced as , between two non-obstruents (obstruents = stops or fricatives.)

Stops and sonorants may occur geminate. Some consonant clusters are allowed (almost invariably two-consonant), most involving sonorants; prenasalised ones are particularly common.

 are found in some Arabic loanwords.

The vowel system is unclear; phonetically, it seems to be basically: .

There seem to be three phonemic tones: high, low, and occasionally falling.

Schadeberg &amp; Elias 1979 note short vowels with a cedilla, normal vowels with a single letter and long vowels by double the letter, for example a̧, a, aa. The two central vowels are described as &quot;less dark&quot; ə͔ and &quot;darker&quot; ə͕ than ə.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Each noun consists of a prefix plus a stem; the prefix identifies its noun class. It changes according to number.

The genders include:
* &quot;w-&quot;, pl. &quot;y-&quot;: this gender seems to consist mainly of persons and animals. E.g.: &quot;wùttar&quot; &quot;chief&quot; &gt; &quot;yáttar&quot; &quot;chiefs&quot;; &quot;wín&quot; &quot;snake&quot; &gt; &quot;yínét&quot; &quot;snakes&quot;.
* bilabial-, pl. &quot;yi-&quot;, including several trees; e.g. &quot;wòr&quot; &quot;um-kaddaqi tree&quot; &gt; &quot;yíwóórèn&quot;, &quot;púrn&quot; &quot;upper arm&quot; &gt; &quot;yìbúrn&quot;.
* pl. with no initial change, including a number of kinship terms; e.g. &quot;màrá&quot; &quot;road&quot; &gt; &quot;màrnát&quot;, &quot;àppá&quot; &quot;father&quot; &gt; &quot;àppánàt&quot;
* &quot;t-&quot;, pl. &quot;y-&quot;: mostly body parts; e.g. &quot;tárák&quot; &quot;skin&quot; &gt; &quot;yárák&quot;, &quot;téŋlàk&quot; &quot;tongue&quot; &gt; &quot;yáŋùlàk&quot;.
* &quot;t-&quot;, pl. &quot;ŋ-&quot;: almost exclusively body parts; e.g. &quot;téŋlàk&quot; &quot;tongue&quot; &gt; &quot;ŋéŋlàk&quot;, &quot;tìɲèn&quot; &quot;tooth&quot; &gt; &quot;ŋìɲèn&quot;.
* &quot;t-&quot; with no plural: place names, mass nouns
* &quot;y-&quot;, pl. &quot;ŋ-&quot;: notably fruits and body parts, but also a wide variety of others. E.g. &quot;yé&quot; &quot;egg&quot; &gt; &quot;ŋíye&quot;; &quot;yìmbó&quot; &quot;knee&quot; &gt; &quot;ŋìmbó&quot;.
* &quot;ŋ-&quot; with no plural: languages, liquids, possibly verbal nouns; e.g. &quot;ŋə͕́gdìráá&quot; &quot;Arabic&quot; (&lt; &quot;kə̀dráá&quot; &quot;Arab&quot;), &quot;ŋàì&quot; &quot;water&quot;.
* &quot;k-&quot;, pl. &quot;s-&quot;: seems to be the commonest gender, includes all sorts of semantic fields; e.g. &quot;kábà&quot; &quot;hut&quot; &gt; &quot;sábà&quot;, &quot;kám&quot; &quot;hair&quot; &gt; &quot;sám&quot;, &quot;kàdìrú&quot; &quot;pig&quot; &gt; &quot;sàdìrú&quot;.
* &quot;c-&quot;, pl. &quot;ɲ-&quot;: includes a wide variety of semantic fields; derives diminutives; e.g.: &quot;cíŋ&quot; &quot;child, boy&quot; &gt; &quot;ɲín&quot;; &quot;cúdén&quot; &quot;bird&quot; &gt; &quot;ɲúdén&quot;.

In genitive (possessive) constructions, the head noun is followed by a linking element which agrees with it in class, followed by the possessor noun; e.g. &quot;ɲín ɲi-adam&quot; &quot;children of Adam&quot;; &quot;kʊs ki-gai&quot; &quot;skull (ie bone of head)&quot;.

===Adjectives===

Adjectives follow the noun, and agree in noun class, i.e. in gender and number; e.g. &quot;kús kàlló&quot; &quot;a thin bone&quot; &gt; &quot;sús sàlló&quot; &quot;thin bones&quot;.

====Demonstratives====

Demonstratives too follow the noun, and agree in class. There are:
* three short : &quot;-i-&quot; &quot;this&quot; (with the agreement prefix copied after the i as well as before), &quot;-ur, -un&quot; &quot;that&quot;. E.g.: &quot;gálám kɛ́k&quot; &quot;this pencil&quot; &gt; &quot;sálmát sɛ́s&quot; &quot;these pencils&quot;; &quot;gálám kur&quot; &quot;that pencil&quot;.
* three long, formed by adding &quot;(-)-an&quot; to the previous; e.g. &quot;wùskén wèwán&quot; &quot;this knife&quot;, &quot;gálám kurkan&quot; &quot;that pencil&quot;.

===Numbers===

The numbers one to four are normal adjectives; e.g. &quot;yʊ́r yùkók&quot; &quot;two hands&quot;. Other numbers&#x27; behavior is unknown. When used without a head noun, they appear as follows, with the prefix &quot;w-&quot; for numbers 1-5:
# &quot;wàttá, ùttá&quot;
# &quot;wùkkók&quot;
# &quot;wìttá&quot;
# &quot;wàrʊ̀m&quot;
# &quot;wʊ̧̀ràm&quot;
# &quot;ɲérér&quot;
# &quot;ʊ̀mʊ̀rgʊ́&quot;
# &quot;tùppá&quot;
# &quot;kʊ́mnàsá(n)&quot;
# &quot;kʊ́mán&quot;

===Pronouns===

The pronouns are as follows:

Examples of verbal personal inflection: &quot;Musa àdúbìr&quot; &quot;Musa beat me&quot;; &quot;yàyá&quot; &quot;I drink&quot;.

Interrogative pronouns include &quot;agn&quot; &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;tá̧jí̧n&quot; &quot;who?&quot;, &quot;nɛ́gán&quot; &quot;where?&quot;, &quot;cínàcɛ̀n&quot; &quot;which (boy)?&quot;

===Verbs===

There appear to be at least four basic forms: present (e.g. &quot;y-ìlàm&quot; &quot;I see&quot;), past (e.g., &quot;y-ílàm&quot; &quot;I saw&quot;), imperative (e.g. &quot;k-ìlmɛ́&quot; &quot;see! (sg.)), and negative imperative (e.g., &quot;ánák w-èlm-ò&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t see! (sg.)). The difference between present and past is typically marked by tone: LH or occasionally LL in the present, HL in the past. Sometimes vowel changes are also observed. In the imperative, some verbs take a &quot;k-&quot; prefix, others do not; this may depend on whether or not the verb begins with a vowel.

The verb &quot;to be&quot; has different roots according to tense: &quot;-ɛ́n&quot; in the present tense, &quot;-ɪ́rɪ̀n&quot; in the past tense.

Negation of the verb is expressed by a prefix &quot;k-&quot;, followed by the verb &quot;to be&quot;, inflected for person; negation of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, by &quot;k-àrà&quot; in the present tense, &quot;k-ɪ̀rá&quot; in the past.

Verbal nouns include agent nouns in &quot;t-&quot; (e.g., &quot;t-ubi&quot; &quot;beater&quot;), gerunds in &quot;t-&quot; (e.g., &quot;t-àyá&quot; &quot;drinkable&quot;), and action nouns (e.g., &quot;ŋ-ìlàm&quot; &quot;sight&quot;.)

===Syntax===

The basic word order is subject–object–verb, including in the imperative. Locative complements also precede the verb. Nominal sentences use the verb &quot;to be&quot;. Modifiers consistently follow their head nouns.

<text>Kristian Levring (; born 9 May 1957) is a Danish film director. He was the fourth signatory of the Dogme95 movement. His feature films as director include &quot;Et skud fra hjertet&quot;, &quot;The King is Alive&quot;, &quot;The Intended&quot;, &quot;Fear Me Not&quot;, and &quot;The Salvation&quot;.

==Early life==
Kristian Levring was born in 1957 in Copenhagen. He later became a graduate of the National Film School of Denmark.

==Career==
Kristian Levring began his career as a documentarian, editing a number of feature-length documentaries and Danish-language feature films during the first two decades of his time as a filmmaker. He also worked as a director for television commercials. His first feature film he directed was &quot;Et skud fra hjertet&quot; (&quot;Shot from the Heart&quot;), released in 1986. Kristian Levring was the fourth signatory of the Dogme95 movement, however moved away from this style towards the end of the aughts. He co-signed the original manifesto in 1995 alongside Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen. In 2008, Levring and the other Dogme 95 founders were honoured with the Achievement in World Cinema award at the European Film Awards.

===&quot;The King is Alive&quot;===
Levring released the film &quot;The King is Alive&quot; in 2000. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the film as following, &quot;bus passengers stranded in the Namibian desert, who decide to stage their own private performance of &quot;King Lear&quot; to pass the time until help arrives.&quot; The passengers are stranded in an abandoned mining town in the middle of the Sahara. The film utilized &quot;Lear&quot; as a foil for European society reaching a terminal crisis. The words of &quot;Lear&quot; are used to further show the disintegration of the group into chaos under the pressure of their stranding. While one of the members is sent on a five-day journey to get help, the social relationships that Levring explores among those that stay behind include gender, marital, and the racial elements of the relationship between the passengers and the bus driver. The film was named an Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival upon its premiere.

The film has many elements in line with the Dogme95 cinematic beliefs, including placing film as a post-apocalyptic art form. Jan Simons wrote that, &quot;&quot;The King is Alive&quot; allows us to see Dogma 95 &quot;in actu&quot;, as it were. With no decor and no costumes, in the natural light of the sun&#x27;s glare, and with no recourse to the technical resources of theatre, the amateur actors study their roles; Henry writes everybody&#x27;s lines out by hand, from memory.&quot; Referencing to the rules of Dogma 95 are also found throughout the film. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Levring&#x27;s work on the film that, 
&quot;Mr. Levring&#x27;s vision of hell is vivid and stark but -- thanks to that empty, endless desert -- touched with a pictorial sublimity rarely attempted within the constraints of the Dogma aesthetic. The unsparing, invasive naturalism of digital video, which seems specially calibrated to register the play of anxiety and distress on human faces, also records an inhuman landscape of undulating dunes and blinding sky. The juxtaposition creates a sense of loneliness and panic, a stomach-turning dread that makes the survival instinct look almost comically weak.&quot;
===&quot;The Intended&quot;===
In 2002, Levring co-wrote and directed &quot;The Intended&quot;. The film follows two British expatriates and their lives in a remote Asian ivory trading station during the early 1900s, where the small community falls apart under the pressures of the foreign lands and daily struggles to survive. The film has been described as, &quot;an expressionistic and densely textured revisitation of &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; in the jungles of Malaysia.&quot; The film opened at the Toronto International Film Festival.

===&quot;Fear Me Not&quot;===
In 2008 Levring directed &quot;Fear Me Not&quot;. The film explores the issues of prescription medication on the psychology of families, following the protagonist as they try the use of antidepressants to cure his malaise stemming from workaholism. The protagonist soon becomes paranoid and starts to fear his spouse. The plot is reminiscent of the narrative of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, and debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the rights were sold to IFC. The film also opened at the Toronto International Film Festival.

===&quot;The Salvation&quot;===
Levring&#x27;s western film titled &quot;The Salvation&quot;, starred Mads Mikkelsen and was screened at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it became an Official Selection. Levring filmed the movie in South Africa, setting it in the American frontier. The story follows the character Jon, a Danish &quot;ex-soldier who moved to the States after losing to the Germans on the battlefield in 1864,&quot; according to &quot;Variety&quot;. Levring has stated that during this era, about half of all people on the American frontier did not speak English, which was the entry-point for him to produce a film about the American west. In developing the film, Levring used both Western films and Nordic mythology as inspiration. In an interview with &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, Levring stated of the film&#x27;s subject matter that, &quot;You could see the Western frontier as the beginning of civilization, and I’m very interested in the nature of civilization. Often these places are a microscope: you can look at these characters and see how they behave in quite extreme situations. Civilization is quite a thin varnish, and when you take that away it’s interesting to see what happens.&quot; Levring both cowrote and directed the film.

<doc id="1166515" wikidata="Q3757020" url="?curid=1166515" title="Tom Barry (Irish republican)">
<text>Thomas Bernardine Barry (1 July 1897 – 2 July 1980), better known as Tom Barry, was a prominent guerrilla leader in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. He is best remembered for orchestrating the Kilmichael ambush, in which he and his column wiped out a 18-man patrol of Auxiliaries, killing sixteen men.

Born in County Kerry, Barry was the son of a former Royal Irish Constabulary constable. In 1915, at the age of seventeen, he joined the British Army and would go on to see action as a gunner in the Middle East during the First World War. Despite expressing some British patriotism during his early years, Barry&#x27;s views slowly began to change towards Irish republicanism. In his memoir, Barry stated that this started shortly after he heard about the Easter Rising in 1916, though records show that after the war he made two unsuccessful attempts at joining the British Civil Service. In July 1920, he joined the IRA&#x27;s 3rd Cork Brigade. Using his experience from his time in the British Army, he was able to train up the men in the flying column so it could become an effective fighting unit. Barry then became the column&#x27;s overall commander and would lead the Brigade in a number of successful attacks against British forces, including the ambushes at Kilmichael and Crossbarry.

Barry was amongst the Anti-Treaty IRA, republicans that opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Following the outbreak of the civil war, Barry was briefly imprisoned by the new Irish Free State but managed to escape and go on to command Anti-Treaty forces in the southern regions of Ireland. When it became clear that victory could not be achieved, Barry proposed that the Anti-Treaty IRA should lay down their arms, which led to frequent clashes with Liam Lynch. Barry still continued to be a part of the IRA after the civil war and served briefly as its commander-in-chief in 1937, during which he devised a proposed plan for an IRA offensive into Northern Ireland and opened contacts with Nazi Germany. After leaving the IRA, Barry would write &quot;Guerrilla Days in Ireland&quot;, a memoir about his service in World War I and in Ireland.

==Early life==
Thomas Barry was born in Killorglin, County Kerry. He was the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary policeman Thomas Barry and Margaret Donovan. Four years later, Thomas Barry Senior resigned and opened a business in his hometown of Rosscarbery, County Cork. Barry was first educated at Ardagh Boys&#x27; National School before later attending Mungret College in County Limerick from 25 August 1911 to 12 September 1912. The reason for his short stay is indicated by a reference from the school register of the Apostolic School, Mungret College: &quot;Went–Home (ran away) without knowledge of superiors – no vocation&quot;.

==World War I==
In 1915, during Ireland&#x27;s involvement in World War I, he enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery at Cork and became a soldier in the British Army.

Barry enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery on 30 June 1915 and was sent to the military depot at Athlone for basic training. After six months he was posted to the Mesopotamian front (modern Iraq) on 21 January 1916. He fought from January 1916 in Mesopotamia (then part of the Ottoman Empire). On 1 March, he was raised to the rank of corporal. In April, while his brigade was attempting to break the Turkish Siege of Kut, Barry first heard of the Easter Rising, which he describes in his memoir as &quot;a rude awakening&quot;. Perhaps, in reaction to the British response to the Rising, Barry dropped his rank at his own request on 26 May and reverted to his original rank of gunner, which he would hold until the end of the war.

From January 1917 until March 1918, he saw further action south of Kut, where his unit suffered heavy casualties, and also at Fallujah, Samarra and Baquba. In May 1918, his division was moved to the Egyptian front for the campaign in Palestine. Barry, however, remained in Egypt from June 1918 until February 1919, when he was shipped back to Ireland. Barry had some minor disciplinary issues in the Army, being punished on a number of occasions for being late for parade and disrespectful to NCOs. Nevertheless, when officially discharged from the army on 7 April 1919 Barry was described as a sober, good, hardworking man.

==War of Independence==
On his return to Bandon in County Cork, Barry first began to study Law and Business Affairs, while at the same time maintaining friendship with local ex-servicemen&#x27;s organisations and building connections to the Irish republican movement. Initially Barry seemed proud of his wartime British Army service and hoisted a Union flag at Bandon on the first anniversary of the war&#x27;s end in November 1919. For this reason he was distrusted by some local republicans, particularly Tom Hales.

In fact Barry acted as secretary to the Bandon Branch of the ex-servicemen&#x27;s association, which was headed by local unionist the Earl of Bandon, from mid-1919 until mid-1920. He also applied to join the British Civil Service and for a posting to India, but seems to have failed the relevant exams.

Barry claimed in his Military Pension Application in 1940 that he had been infiltrating the ex-servicemen&#x27;s organisation on orders from IRA Intelligence officer Sean Buckley and was secretly enrolled in the IRA from August 1919.

However, it was only in July 1920 that he formally applied join the 3rd (West) Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which was then engaged in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). A number of events have been cited as influencing his decision to join the IRA. One was his failure to secure employment after the war. Another was the death of fellow ex-serviceman John Bourke, a veteran of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, who was bayoneted to death in a riot between Irish veterans and British troops; Barry acted as a guard of honour at Bourke&#x27;s funeral. A possible third reason was the brutal beating of IRA members Tom Hales and Patrick Harte, both of whom were from Bandon, by officers of the Essex Regiment during an interrogation in July 1920.

Before being accepted into the IRA, he was first interviewed by IRA officers Ted O&#x27;Sullivan and Charlie Hurley, in order to vet him. Having overcome the suspicion he could be a spy, and helped by the fact that Tom Hales had been arrested and replaced as Brigade commander by Charlie Hurley, by late summer he was acting as their brigade training officer. Barry was initially highly valued by the IRA for his military experience and his ability to train their own raw volunteers.

At this time the IRA&#x27;s guerrilla tactics were taking shape and small groups of dedicated guerrillas were being organised and trained. Barry participated in four training camps and two attacks on British forces in the autumn of 1920 – the Fanlobus ambush on 9 October and the Tooreen Ambush on 22 October, at the latter of which he commanded a section. He also tried, with Charlie Hurley, to assassinate a number of local police and judicial officials.

However, Barry soon came to command the West Cork Brigade&#x27;s flying column and definitively made his name as a guerrilla commander at the Kilmichael Ambush on 28 November 1920. This was a turning point of the war, when a company of 18 Auxiliaries was wiped out at the cost three IRA killed. The British alleged that Barry&#x27;s men had killed wounded and surrendering Auxiliaries and mutilated their corpses. This was a charge that Barry always denied, claiming that he had ordered that no prisoners be taken after the Auxiliaries faked a surrender resulting in the death of some of his men.

Barry was hospitalised for a time after the Kilmichael action and martial law was proclaimed in County Cork and across much of the province of Munster in response. However, in December the column regrouped, attacking a number of police and military barracks in the West Cork region. In one such instance in February 1921, Barry&#x27;s column attempted to launch an attack on the RIC Barracks in Rosscarbery, billeting at Burgatia House, which was owned by a Loyalist family, to avoid detection. However, a contingent of Black and Tans was sent out arrest them after being tipped off by a postman. After a brief firefight, Barry and his men were able to push them back and escape. The column, which was around 30–40 strong, dispersed shortly afterwards into smaller units and subsequently lost 11 men killed. Three men died in the Upton Train Ambush and eight more died in various incidents and encounters with British forces.

In March 1921, Barry mobilised his largest guerrilla force of 104 men, divided into seven sections, and at the Crossbarry Ambush broke out of an encirclement of 1,200 strong British force from the Essex Regiment. At least ten British soldiers were killed in the action, along with three IRA volunteers including Brigade commander Charlie Hurley.

In total, British forces numbered over 12,500 men in County Cork during the conflict, while Barry&#x27;s men numbered no more than 310. Eventually, Barry&#x27;s tactics made West Cork ungovernable for the British authorities except by military means. In the late spring and early summer of 1921, British forces mounted large sweeps of the West Cork area, complete with aerial surveillance and armoured vehicles, forcing Barry&#x27;s column to spend much of its time &quot;on the run&quot; in mountainous terrain to avoid them. While they did avoid being encircled, they were able to mount only one more major attack, which was on Rosscarbery police barracks in late March 1921.

Barry&#x27;s ability as a guerrilla commander was widely acknowledged in the IRA, and in the early summer of 1921 he was summoned to Dublin to meet with IRA leader Michael Collins and President of the Irish Republic Éamon de Valera. He also participated in the formation of the IRA&#x27;s First Southern Division, of which he was made Deputy Commander.

Barry openly admitted in his memoir to taking a hard line with people he believed were collaborators with the British forces. He stated that his unit executed 16 civilians accused of informing in the first six months of 1921. While he acknowledged that nine of the 16 killings were Protestants, who were a minority in West Cork, he maintained that they were killed for no other reason than for their aid to British forces. He maintained, &quot;The majority of the West Cork Protestants lived at peace throughout the entire struggle and were not interfered with by the IRA&quot;. Barry also stated that his unit burned the houses of local loyalists in retaliation for burning of republicans&#x27; homes by British forces and carried out reprisal killings of captured and off-duty British soldiers in response to the execution of IRA men.

The war in rural Cork was abruptly ended with a truce negotiated to come into effect on 11 July 1921. At this time the West Cork flying column was, with other IRA units, in a training camp in the mountains along the Cork/Kerry border. Barry recalled his initial reaction as &quot;dazed and uncertain of the future&quot; but relief that the &quot;days of fear were ended, at least for a time&quot;. He claimed that his unit had killed over 100 British troops and wounded another 93 during the conflict.

Barry later wrote of the period:

==Civil War==
During the truce period, Barry married Leslie Mary Price, who was herself a republican activist. Barry opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6 December 1921 because he felt it gave up the Irish Republic and accepted the partition of Ireland. In March 1922, he participated in an IRA convention which disavowed the authority of the Dáil to approve the Treaty and was elected on to the anti-Treaty IRA&#x27;s executive. In March 1922, he and his men occupied barracks in Limerick in defiance of the new Irish Free State government, and it looked as if fighting would break out until Liam Lynch IRA Chief of Staff arrived and defused the situation. In May 1922, Barry along with Rory O&#x27;Connor and Ernie O&#x27;Malley seized a convoy of arms intended for the new Free State police force and drove it to the anti-Treaty IRA headquarter in the Four Courts in Dublin.

On 28 June 1922, the Irish Civil War formally broke out between Pro- and Anti-treaty factions when Free State forces opened fire on the Four Courts. Barry was in Cork at the time, but made his way to Dublin when the fighting started. He was captured while trying to get into the Four Courts and was imprisoned by the Irish Free State in Mountjoy Gaol after the Battle of Dublin in July 1922. Barry had voiced the opinion that, at the start of the civil war, while the Republican side was stronger, it should have taken over Dublin and the major cities and forced a new confrontation with the British. In September of that year, however, he escaped from an internment camp at Gormanston in County Meath and travelled south, to take command of the anti-Treaty IRA Second Southern Division. Barry returned to his previous role of guerrilla commander, leading a column of around 200 men based in West Cork. In mid-December 1922, he led his men in the capture of a string of towns across the province of Munster, including Carrick on Suir, and towns in Kilkenny, namely Thomastown and Mullinavat, killing two Irish National Army soldiers and taking prisoner the Free State garrisons there, amounting to over 110 men, and seizing their arms. However, due to a shortage of men and equipment, he was unable to hold these places, evacuating them before National Army reinforcements arrived. Withdrawing to the rugged country on the Cork/Kerry border, his column and Kerry IRA units (a total of about 65 men) mounted an assault on Millstreet early in 1923, failing to take the town, but killing two Free State soldiers and taking 39 prisoner.

However, as 1923 went on, Barry found his column increasingly weakened by casualties and arrests. By February 1923, Barry increasingly argued with Liam Lynch, the Republican commander in chief, that the war should be brought to an end, as there was no hope of victory. Barry proposed to a meeting of the IRA Executive on 23–26 March that a ceasefire should be called, but he was defeated by six votes to five. After the death of Lynch in a Free State attack on 10 April, the anti-treaty campaign was halted on 30 April, then called off when Frank Aiken issued an order on 24 May to &quot;dump arms&quot;. One author claims that Barry tried to act as intermediary with the pro-Treaty Irish Republican Brotherhood to end the war and for a time had a letter from the Free State authorities granting him &#x27;immunity from arrest&#x27;. This caused him to fall out with other members of the IRA Army Council. For his part, Barry stated that rumours, some spread by Republicans, about his negotiating for peace or compromise with the Free State were &quot;absolutely false&quot;.

Nevertheless, the Free State government never formally acknowledged the end of the civil war marked by the republicans&#x27; ceasefire and dump arms order. Barry had to remain on the run until a general amnesty was declared in November 1924.

The Third Cork IRA Brigade, of which Barry commanded the Active Service Unit or flying column, lost 34 men killed in the war against the British and another 21 anti-Treatyites killed in the civil war. This made a total of 55, excluding pro-Treaty volunteers who died in the civil war but whom Barry did not record in his memoir.

==Subsequent IRA career==
According to historian Brian Hanley, Tom Barry left the IRA shortly after the Executive had narrowly defeated his proposal (of March 1923) to hand over its arms to prevent further bloodshed between nationalists. In his letter of 11 July 1923 to the Army Executive, Barry resigned as a member of that body, the Army Council and an IRA officer. He offered his services if, at some future date, arms should be taken up again in the struggle to make Ireland an independent country. Barry&#x27;s biographer Meda Ryan disputes this evidence, claiming that Barry only resigned from the IRA leadership in 1923, but remained a rank and file member before reassuming a leadership role in 1932.

He served as general superintendent of Cork Harbour Commission from 1927 to 1965. He initially proposed cooperation of the IRA and Fianna Fáil, the party led by erstwhile republican leader Éamon de Valera, especially against the Blueshirts, a militant movement born out of Pro-treaty civil war veterans. However, De Valera banned both the IRA and the Blueshirts, and Barry was imprisoned from May to December 1934 for arms possession. In March 1936, Barry was involved in the shooting dead of Vice-Admiral Henry Somerville. Four men burst into Somerville&#x27;s family home at Castletownshend, Cork and fired a revolver. Somerville was targeted for recruiting local men to join the Royal Navy.

In 1937, he succeeded Seán MacBride as chief of staff. Barry made preparations for a planned IRA offensive in Northern Ireland, but the plan was ultimately cancelled days before it was set to commence as a result of leaks and the infiltration of the IRA by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Barry would assert in later life that he opposed both the 1930s bombing campaign in England and IRA contacts with Nazi Germany. In fact, in January 1937 he had taken a trip to Germany seeking German support, which was assured to him subject to the condition that the IRA limit its actions to British military installations once war was declared. Financing was to be arranged through the &quot;Clann na Gael&quot; in the United States. The Army Convention in April 1938 adopted Seán Russell&#x27;s S-Plan instead. Barry resigned as chief of staff as a result, but remained in contact with German agents at least to February 1939.

==Irish Army career==
In 1940, Barry was made responsible for Intelligence in the Irish Army&#x27;s Southern Command, a position he held, with the rank of Commandant, for the duration of World War II (see The Emergency). In 1941, he was denounced by the IRA for writing for &quot;An Cosantóir&quot;, the Irish Army&#x27;s official magazine. In 1942, following the fall of Singapore to the Imperial Japanese Army, Barry purportedly sent a telegram to the British commander Arthur Percival, who was his opponent during the war of independence, &quot;congratulating&quot; him on the defence.

==Later life==
He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1946 Cork Borough by-election, running as an Independent and finishing last out of the four candidates with 8.7% of the first preference votes.

In 1966, Barry was invited to a number of events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising but declined each one of them, expressing that he felt it wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to partake in any commemoration as he was serving in the Middle East at the time of the rising. On 10 July the same year, Barry attended the unveiling of the monument to the Kilmichael ambush along with other surviving participants, where they formed a guard of honour during the ceremony.

Barry took a militant line on the Northern Ireland conflict post 1969, arguing in 1971 that peaceful means would never achieve Irish unity and supporting armed action there. However, he remained opposed to IRA bombings which led to civilian deaths and by 1977, appeared to have grown disillusioned with the IRA campaign, stating, &quot;the men who were carrying out the recent killings... could not be called IRA&quot;. He refused in that year to lend his support to Provisional IRA hunger strikers in Portlaoise Prison. He was against the tactics of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s campaign, particularly their use of car bombs against civilians, though he did defend attacks on British soldiers on active duty in Northern Ireland. In a 1976 interview with &quot;The Sunday Independent&quot;, Barry said,

===Memoir===
In 1949, Barry published his memoirs of the Irish War of Independence, &quot;Guerilla Days in Ireland&quot;. It describes his Brigade&#x27;s activities, such as the ambushes at Kilmichael and Crossbarry, as well as numerous other less known actions which were directed against the British Army, Black and Tans, the Auxiliary Division and the Royal Irish Constabulary.

===Death===
Barry died on 2 July 1980 at a hospital in Cork. He is buried in St. Finbarr&#x27;s Cemetery, Cork.

==In popular culture==
* Bobby Sands wrote a poem about Barry after his death, entitled &quot;Tom Barry&quot;. It was published posthumously in the collection &quot;Prison Poems&quot;.
*In 2011, Barry&#x27;s memoirs were adapted into a four-man stage play of the same name. Written and directed by Neil Pearson, the play follows Barry&#x27;s service during the First World War and War of Independence.

<text>The King Is Alive is a 2000 drama film directed by Kristian Levring. The fourth film to be done according to the Dogme 95 rules, it was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==

A group of tourists are stranded in the Namibian desert when their bus loses its way and runs out of fuel. Canned carrots and dew keep the tourists alive, but they are helplessly entrapped, completely cut off from the rest of the world. As courage and moral fibre weaken and relationships grow shaky, Henry, a theatrical manager, persuades the group to put on Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;King Lear&quot;. As the tourists work their way through Henry&#x27;s hand-written scripts for an audience of only the sand dunes and one distant, indigenous watcher, real life increasingly begins to resemble the play.

==Cast==
* Miles Anderson as Jack
* Romane Bohringer as Catherine
* David Bradley as Henry
* David Calder as Charles
* Bruce Davison as Ray
* Brion James as Ashley
* Peter Khubeke as Kanana (as Peter Kubheka)
* Vusi Kunene as Moses
* Jennifer Jason Leigh as Gina
* Janet McTeer as Liz
* Chris Walker as Paul
* Lia Williams as Amanda

==Reception==

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The King Is Alive&quot; holds an approval rating of 60%, based on 68 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;Though the plot feels rather contrived, the ensemble acting in this Dogme 95 film is good.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<doc id="1166525" wikidata="Q397284" url="?curid=1166525" title="Agricultural biodiversity">
<text>Agricultural biodiversity or agrobiodiversity is a subset of general biodiversity pertaining to agriculture. It can be defined as &quot;the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels that sustain the ecosystem structures, functions and processes in and around production systems, and that provide food and non-food agricultural products.” It is managed by farmers, pastoralists, fishers and forest dwellers, agrobiodiversity provides stability, adaptability and resilience and constitutes a key element of the livelihood strategies of rural communities throughout the world. Agrobiodiversity is central to sustainable food systems and sustainable diets. The use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to food security, nutrition security, and livelihood security, and it is critical for climate adaptation and climate mitigation.

==Etymology==
It is not clear when exactly the term agrobiodiversity was coined nor by whom. The 1990 annual report of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR, now Bioversity International) is one of the earliest references to biodiversity in the context of agriculture. Most references to agricultural biodiversity date from the late 1990s onwards.

While similar, different definitions are used by different bodies to describe biodiversity in connection with food production. CGIAR tends to use agricultural biodiversity or agrobiodiversity, while the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) uses &#x27;biodiversity for food and agriculture&#x27; and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) uses the term &#x27;agricultural diversity&#x27;. The CBD more or less (but not entirely) excludes marine aquatic organisms and forestry in its usage because they have their own groups and international frameworks for discussion of international policies and actions. Decision V/5 of the CBD provides the framing description.

== Types ==

===Crop biodiversity===
===Livestock biodiversity===
== Levels ==

=== Genetic diversity ===

Genetic diversity refers to the variety and variability within and between species. It can refer to the naturally occurring genetic variability within and between populations of a species, for example wild relatives of food crops, or to the variability created by humans, for example farmer-developed traditional crop varieties called landraces, or commercially bred varieties of a crop (e.g. different apple varieties: Fuji, Golden Delicious, Golden Pippin, etc.). There is considerable genetic diversity within all food crop species, particularly in centres of origin, which are the geographical areas where species were originally developed. For example, the Andean region of Peru is a centre of origin for certain tuber species, and over 1,483 varieties of these species can be found there. Genetic diversity is important as different genes give rise to important traits, such as nutrient composition, hardiness to different environments, resistance to pests, or ample harvests. Genetic diversity is decreasing due to agricultural modernization, changing land use and climate change, among other factors. (It is even possible that breeding narrowly for the pest- and disease-resistance necessary to deal with climate change will, itself, reduce agrobiodiversity.) Genetic diversity is not static but is constantly evolving in response to changes in the environment and according to human intervention, whether farmers or breeders.

=== Species diversity ===
Species diversity refers to the number and abundance of different species used for food and agriculture. The number of species considered to contribute to food alone ranges from 5,538 to 75,000 depending on definitions. A conservative estimate is that about 6,000 species are commonly used for food. Species diversity includes &quot;the domesticated plants and animals that are part of crop, livestock, forest or aquaculture systems, harvested forest and aquatic species, the wild relatives of domesticated species, and other wild species harvested for food and other products. It also encompasses what is known as “associated biodiversity”, the vast range of organisms that live in and around food and agricultural production systems, sustaining them and contributing to their output.&quot; Agriculture is understood to include crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture.

Aquatic diversity is an important component of agricultural biodiversity. The conservation and sustainable use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, and coastal commons by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as aquaculture and marine fisheries management continue to evolve.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us a choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. 

=== Ecosystem diversity ===

Ecosystem diversity refers to the variety and variability of different components in a given geographical area (e.g. landscape, country). In the context of agrobiodiversity ecosystem diversity refers to the diversity within and between agroecosystems: e.g. pastures, ponds and rivers, planted fields, hedges, trees and so on. Landscape-level biodiversity has received less research attention than the other levels of biodiversity.

== Contributions of agrobiodiversity to food and agriculture ==

=== Introduction ===
Contributions from agrobiodiversity to food and agriculture are usually categorized by their contribution to ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are the services provided by well functioning ecosystems (agroecosystems and also wild ecosystems such as forests or grasslands) to human wellbeing. They are usually clustered into four broader categories: provisioning (direct provision of goods such as food and water), supporting (the services that are needed for agriculture to be healthy, such as soil), regulating (regulating natural processes needed in agriculture such as pollination, carbon capture or pest control), or cultural (recreational, aesthetic and spiritual benefits).

=== Provisioning ===
Agrobiodiversity&#x27;s contribution to provisioning services is mainly for providing food and nutrition. Food biodiversity is &quot;the diversity of plants, animals and other organisms used for food, covering the genetic resources within species, between species and provided by ecosystems.&quot; Historically at least 6,000 plant species and numerous animal species have been used as human food. This number is considered to be decreasing now, resulting in concerns about long-term diet diversity. Food biodiversity also covers subspecies or varieties of crops, for example the many forms of the &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; species (cauliflowers, different broccolis, cabbages, Brussels sprouts, etc.). Many species which have been overlooked by mainstream research (&#x27;orphan&#x27; or &#x27;neglected and underutilized&#x27; species) are rich in micronutrients and other healthful components. Also among different varieties of a species, there can be a wide variety of nutrient composition; for example some sweet potato varieties contain negligible levels of beta-carotene, which others can contain up to 23,100 mcg per 100g of raw, peeled sweet potatoes. Other provisioning services from agrobiodiversity are the provision of wood, fibre, fuel, water and medicinal resources. Sustainable food security is linked to improving the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the diversity of all genetic resources for food and agriculture, especially plant and animal genetic resources, in all types of production systems.

=== Supporting ===

Agrobiodiversity&#x27;s contribution to supporting services is providing the biological or life support to production, emphasising conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the biological resources that support sustainable production systems. The main service is to maintain genetic diversity of crops and species, so that it is available to maintain adaptability to new and changing climate and weather conditions. Genetic diversity is the basis of crop and livestock improvement programmes, which breed new varieties of crops and livestock in response to consumer demand and farmers&#x27; needs. An important source of genetic diversity are crop wild relatives, wild plant species that are genetically related to cultivated crops. A second supporting service is to maintain the habitat of wild biodiversity, particularly associated biodiversity, for example pollinators and predators. Agrobiodiversity can support wild biodiversity through the use of field margins, riparian corridors, hedgerows and clumps of trees, which provide and connect habitats. A further supporting service is maintaining healthy soil biota.

=== Regulating ===
Agrobiodiversity makes several contributions to regulating services, which control the natural processes needed for a healthy agroecosystem. Pollination, pest control and carbon capture are examples.

==== Pollination ====
75% of the 115 major crop species grown globally rely on pollinators. Agrobiodiversity contributes to the health of pollinators by: (a) providing habitat for them to live and breed; (b) providing non-chemical biological options for pest control (see below) so that insecticide use can be reduced, and insect pollinators not damaged; (c) providing a symbiotic relationship of constant flower production, with crops flowering at different times, so that the pollinators have constant access to nectar-producing flowers.

==== Pest control ====
Agrobiodiversity contributes to pest control by: (a) providing a habitat for pests&#x27; natural enemies to live and breed in; (b) providing wide genetic diversity which means it is more likely that genes contain resistance to any given pathogen or pest, and also that the plant can evolve as pests and diseases evolve. Genetic diversity also means that some crops grow earlier or later, or in wetter or drier conditions, so the crop might avoid attacks from the pest or pathogen.

==== Carbon capture ====
Agrobiodiversity contributes to carbon capture if used as part of a package of agroecological practices, for example by providing cover crops which can be dug into the land as green manure; maintaining tree stands and hedgerows; and protecting the integrity of soils so that they continue to house local microbes. Farmers and breeders can use genetic diversity to breed varieties which are more tolerant to changing climate conditions, and which, combined with practices like conservation agriculture, can increase sequestration in soils and biomass, and reduce emissions by avoiding the degrading of farmlands. Using agroforestry, the inclusion of trees and shrubs as an integral part of a farming system, can also successfully sequester carbon.

=== Cultural ===
Agrobiodiversity is central to cultural ecosystem services in the form of food biodiversity, which is central to local cuisines worldwide. Agrobiodiversity provides locally appreciated crops and species, and also unique varieties which have cultural significance. For example, ethnic traditional cultures influence the conservation of a wide diversity of rice varieties in China (e.g. red rice, sweet glutinous rices) developed by farmers over thousands of years and used in traditional cultures, rituals and customs. Another example are local food fairs, epitomized by the Slow Food movement, which celebrates local food varieties in order to add value to them, raise awareness about them and ultimately conserve and use them. In addition, some traditional cultures use agrobiodiversity in cultural rituals, e.g. many populations of fruit species (pomelo and mango) are maintained in rural communities specifically for use at the &#x27;Chhath Puja&#x27; festival, celebrated in parts of India, Nepal and Mauritius. Home gardens are important as culturally constructed spaces where agrobiodiversity is conserved for a wide variety of social, aesthetic and cultural reasons. Genetic diversity is maintained by resource-poor farmers because of many non-monetary values, including culture and food.

== Loss of agrobiodiversity ==
Agrobiodiversity is threatened by changing patterns of land use (urbanization, deforestation), agricultural modernization (monocultures and abandoning of traditional, biodiversity-based practices); Westernization of diets and their supply chains. It has been estimated that biodiversity as a whole is being lost at 100–1000 times the natural background rate. This extends also to agricultural biodiversity and loss of genetic diversity from farmers&#x27; fields and the wild.

Agrobiodiversity loss leads to genetic erosion, the loss of genetic diversity, including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular combinations of genes (or gene complexes) such as those manifested in locally adapted landraces or breeds. Genetic vulnerability occurs when there is little genetic diversity within a population of plants. This lack of diversity makes the population as a whole particularly vulnerable to disease, pests, or other factors. The problem of genetic vulnerability often arises with modern crop varieties, which are uniform by design. An example of the consequences of genetic vulnerability occurred in 1970 when corn blight struck the US corn belt, destroying 15% of the harvest. A particular plant cell characteristic known as Texas male sterile cytoplasm conferred vulnerability to the blight - a subsequent study by the National Academy of Sciences found that 90% of American maize plants carried this trait.

Reduced agrobiodiversity influences, and is influenced by, changes in human diets. Since the mid-1900s, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally. The differences between the foods eaten in different countries decreased by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern &#x27;global standard&#x27; diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world&#x27;s human population, including wheat, rice, sugar, maize, soybean (by +284%), palm oil (by +173%), and sunflower (by +246%). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important food biodiversity, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including rye, yam, sweet potato (by -45%), cassava (by -38%), coconut, sorghum (by -52%) and millets (by -45%).

=== Examples ===

* The Irish potato blight of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million. It was the result of planting only two potato varieties, both vulnerable to the blight, &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, which arrived in 1845
* When rice grassy stunt virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India in the 1970s, 6,273 varieties were tested for resistance. Only one was resistant, an Indian variety and known to science only since 1966. This variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely grown.
* Coffee rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri Lanka, Brazil and Central America in 1970. A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia. The diseases are themselves a form of biodiversity.
* Monoculture was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters, including the European wine industry collapse in the late 19th century and the US southern corn leaf blight epidemic of 1970.

== Control of damaging associated biodiversity ==
The control of damaging associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On monoculture farms, the approach is generally to suppress damaging associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive pesticides, mechanized tools and transgenic engineering techniques, then to rotate crops. Although some polyculture farmers use the same techniques, they also employ integrated pest management strategies as well as more labor-intensive strategies, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology, and energy.

== Conservation ==
Attempts to conserve or safeguard agrobiodiversity usually focus on species or genetic level of agrobiodiversity. Conservation of genetic diversity and species diversity can be carried out &quot;ex situ,&quot; which means removing the materials from their growing site and looking after them elsewhere, or &quot;in situ,&quot; which means that they are conserved in their natural or cultivated site. While these two approaches are sometimes pitted against each other as either/or, both have merits. Conservation practitioners recommend integrating both methods, according to the purpose of conservation, threats, uniqueness of diversity, etc. 

=== &quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation ===

&quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation is defined as the “conservation of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats.” &quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation is the conservation of genetic resources (species, varieties, cultivars, sub-species, landraces etc.) for food and agriculture outside their natural habitat, in a managed environment including: botanical gardens, seedbanks, pollenbanks, field genebanks, cryobank or herbaria. &quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation is considered a relatively reliable way of maintaining genetic diversity, since it is usually preserved over the longer term  and is less prone to change. The diversity of much of the world&#x27;s major crops has been extensively collected and conserved in genebanks. Over 7 million samples are conserved in 1,750 genebanks worldwide. Collections are safety-duplicated as an insurance in case of damage to one genebank. In addition, most globally important collections of annual or seed-bearing crops have a backup in the Svalbard global seed vault.

&quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation offers some advantages for seed-bearing crops: 1) Seed requires little space; 2) Ex situ conservation can be implemented anywhere; 3) There is easy access to what is conserved for distribution, further use, research  and breeding; 4) Costs for maintaining genetic diversity that has no immediate production or market value are minimum.

Weaknesses of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation include: 1) it is costly to maintain seeds and germplasm healthily in perpetual storage, or in field collections; 2) Coverage of the diversity of neglected and underutilized crops or crop wild relatives is currently very limited. Genebanks have largely focused on the conservation of major staple crops while non-staple crops and crop wild relatives are poorly represented; 3) There are species with ‘recalcitrant’ seeds, which means they cannot be stored long term; 4) Specialized infrastructure and staff are needed.

===&quot;In situ&quot; conservation ===

&quot;In situ&quot; conservation means &quot;the conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of viable populations of species in their natural surroundings and, in the case of domesticated or cultivated species, in the surroundings where they have developed their distinctive properties&quot;. &quot;In situ&quot; conservation comprises both conservation of trees and crop wild relatives &quot;in situ&quot; in the wild, and conservation of landraces and neglected and underutilized species on farm in farmers&#x27; fields. Conserving agrobiodiversity &quot;in situ&quot; has the benefit that species can continue to evolve in response to natural and human pressures. In the case of crops, a large amount of diversity is retained in developing countries by smallholder farmers, particularly for many crops in their centers of domestication and diversity. There, farmers continue to grow landraces and maintain traditional knowledge and seed management practices in a process known as de facto conservation. Home gardens too are repositories of high levels of species diversity, and traditional landraces contain wide genetic diversity. For forest trees, &quot;in situ&quot; conservation is considered the most appropriate method since most tree seeds cannot be conserved &quot;ex situ&quot;, and because there are 60,000 tree species, each with multiple populations, so too many to identify and collect.

Having limited access to synthetic inputs, resource-poor farmers&#x27; fields are often organic by default. A meta-analysis of studies comparing biodiversity noted that, when compared to organic cropping systems, conventional systems had significantly lower species richness and abundance (30% greater richness and 50% greater abundance in organic systems, on average), though 16% of studies did find a greater level of species richness in conventional systems.

&quot;In situ&quot; conservation is relatively low cost for high levels of biodiversity, particularly crop wild relatives, neglected and underutilized species, landraces, trees, fish and livestock. However, species and varieties conserved &quot;in situ&quot; can be vulnerable to climate changes, land use changes and market demand.

=== Ecosystem level conservation ===
Ecosystem level conservation looks at landscape level, with landscapes managed by the group of stakeholders working together to achieve biodiversity, production and livelihood goals. Land use mosaics combine

# ‘natural’ areas 
# agricultural production areas 
# institutional mechanisms to coordinate initiatives to achieve production, conservation and livelihood objectives at landscape, farm and community scales, by exploiting synergies and managing trade-offs among them.

There are limited initiatives that focus on conserving entire landscapes or agro-ecosystems. One is &#x27;Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems&#x27; (GIAHS), which are conserved and maintained as unique systems of agriculture, in order to sustainably provide multiple goods and services, food and livelihood security for millions of small-scale farmers.

<text>Eason Chan Yick Shun (; born 27 July 1974) is a Hong Kong singer and actor. He is one of the most popular and influential singers in both Cantopop and Mandopop. Besides holding the record for winning the &quot;Ultimate Male Singer – Gold&quot; award (10 times) and &quot;My Favorite Male Singer&quot; award (9 consecutive years) at the &quot;Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation&quot; in HK, he is also holding the record for being nominated for and winning prestigious Golden Melody Awards &quot;Best Male Mandarin Singer&quot; (9 times and 3 times respectively) in Taiwan. Chan was ranked sixth in the 2013 &quot;Forbes&quot; China Celebrity Top 100 List. Chan was ranked third in Spotify Global Top Mandopop Artists of the Years 2023 and 2024. By December 2024, Chan&#x27;s monthly listeners in Spotify was over 4 millions.

Chan is a frequent winner of Asia&#x27;s music awards. He has won a number of prestigious Golden Melody Awards in Taiwan. In 2003, he won Best Mandarin Male Singer and Best Mandarin Album for &quot;&quot;Special Thanks To...&quot;.&quot; In 2009, he won Best Mandarin Album for &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Let Go&quot;. Chan won his second Best Mandarin Male Singer award in 2015, for the album &quot;Rice and Shine&quot;. In 2018, Chan was named Best Mandarin Male Singer for the third time – the most of any singer (tied with Johnny Yin) – for the album &quot;C&#x27;mon In~&quot;.

Chan has kicked off over 300 concerts all around the world since 1999. He successfully held world tours in different regions, including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, mainland China, Southeast Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. He was the first Chinese singer who held tour in London&#x27;s O2 Arena, and the first HK singer who held solo concerts in Beijing&#x27;s National Stadium (Bird&#x27;s Nest). In 2014, Chan&#x27;s net worth was HK$100 million. In 2020, Chan was on Forbes Asia’s inaugural 100 Digital Stars list. Chan was the most-streamed artist in Hong Kong on the Spotify music streaming platform from 2016 to 2021. Since joining UMG, Chan has amassed over 75 billion streams across various platforms by 2023.

==Early life==
Chan was born in Hong Kong on 27 July 1974. Chan went to England to study when he was 12. He attended St. Joseph&#x27;s kindergarten and St. Joseph&#x27;s College Primary School in Hong Kong, Dauntsey&#x27;s School in Wiltshire, England and later Kingston University, studying architecture. He also trained in vocals at the Royal Academy of Music, where he received Grade-8 vocal certifications. Chan returned to Hong Kong before the completion of his degree to participate in the 1995 New Talent Singing Awards Competition, winning first place on July 16, 1995, and signed to Capital Artists, ending his future career as an architect while launching a career in music.

==Career==
Chan has been praised by critics and fellow musicians alike as one of the top singers of his generation. Since the very beginning of his career, he has been one of the favourites to lead the new generation of Cantopop. He has been described as a breath of fresh air in the HK music scene. In the 2000s, Chan emerged as the leading male singer of his generation, fulfilling his role as an innovator and a leader in the HK music scene, winning prestigious awards one after another.
Chan won many major music awards in Hong Kong, eg. Most Popular Male Singer award in the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation twice, in 2006 and 2007.

His Cantonese album &quot;U87&quot;, named after his favourite microphone and released in 2005, was labeled by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the five Asian albums worth buying. &quot;U87&quot; was the top selling non-concert, non-collection category album in Hong Kong in 2005. He was Hong Kong&#x27;s highest selling male artist in 2002, 2003 and 2007. He has been one of Hong Kong&#x27;s top selling artists every year since 2000. His concert DVD &quot;Get a Life&quot; was the highest selling album of 2006.

Chan has also been successful in his work in the Mandopop scene. He has won numerous awards in both mainland China and Taiwan, most notably Taiwan&#x27;s Golden Melody Awards. He is the second non-Taiwanese singer, after Jacky Cheung, to win Taiwan&#x27;s Golden Melody Awards. He won &quot;Best Male Mandarin Singer&quot; third, in 2003, 2015 and 2018, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; twice in 2003 and 2018, and &quot;Best Mandarin Album&quot; in 2009.

His album &quot;Admit It&quot;&quot;&quot; was nominated for Golden Melody Awards&#x27; Best Male Singer; although it was ultimately won by Gary Chaw. Next year, he was again nominated for Golden Melody Awards&#x27; Best Male Singer, for his work in Mandarin album &quot;Don&#x27;t Want To Let Go&quot;, although the award went to Jay Chou. However, Chan won Album of The Year for &quot;Don&#x27;t Want To Let Go&quot;.

Chan has won a number of Asian music awards as well. He won his first Asia Pacific&#x27;s Most Popular Singer Award in 2007, and again in 2008.

Chan has been named by Chinese critics as the next &quot;God of Songs&quot; (歌神) after Jacky Cheung. However, Eason has more than once clarified that he wishes to build his own name instead, and not just be the successor of Jacky Cheung. Chan and Cheung sung a duet together, titled 天下太平, on the album &quot;Perfect Match&quot;, released in April 2006. Chan and Cheung collaborated on other occasions as well.

Chan played several instruments in his live concerts, including the piano, the guitar, the harmonica, and the accordion. Chan is also a songwriter.

In 2009, Chan performed in &quot;PAX Musica 2009&quot; in Tokyo. He sang seven songs, including a Japanese song by Koji Tamaki called &quot;Mr. Lonely&quot;. This was his first time performing in Japan publicly. Japanese Musician Ikurō Fujiwara praised Chan for his charisma on stage and expressed hope to collaborate with Chan in the future. Chan planned to promote his musical works in Japan in 2010.

In 2011, Chan released a new Cantonese album titled &quot;Stranger Under My Skin&quot; on 22 February. Released in November, Chan&#x27;s Mandarin album titled &quot;?&quot; features a piano performance by his seven-year-old daughter.

Chan released the &quot;...3mm&quot; Cantonese album on 10 August 2012 followed by a remix version of the album, titled &quot;...3mm Remix&quot; releasing on 8 November 2012. It was an album by Eric Kwok and Jerald Chan in composing music, including the number one songs &quot;Finish&quot; (完) and &quot;Heavy taste&quot; (重口味). At the same time, Chan opened his own music production company, EAS Music.

In 2014, Chan received Honorary Doctor of Arts degree for accomplishments in the Cantonese music industry from Kingston University, where he studied architecture before entering the entertainment industry.

In 2015, Chan released a Cantonese album &quot;Preparing&quot;&quot;&quot; 《準備中》, which contained the number one song &quot;Unconditional&quot; (無條件). Chan received multiple awards for the work.

In 2017, Chan released a Mandarin album, &quot;C&#x27;mon In~ &quot;, which was awarded at the 29th Golden Melody Awards for Album of the Year and Best Male Mandarin Singer. Besides holding the record for winning Best Male Mandarin Singer (tying the record of Taiwanese singer Johnny Yin), he also became the Hong Kong singer with the most awards for that category.
In 2018, Chan released album &quot;L.O.V.E.&quot;&quot;&quot; (mainly in Cantonese), which was successful in Taiwan&#x27;s 30th Golden Melody Awards, winning nominations to three major awards: Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and Producer of the Year, Album. Ultimately, the album&#x27;s producer, Carl Wong, won the &quot;Producer of the Year, Album&quot; award. This was the first time in the history of the Golden Melody Awards that a Cantonese album won this award.

Chan’s Mandarin single &quot;Warrior of the Darkness&quot; (孤勇者), released in November 2021 for Riot Games&#x27; series Arcane : League of Legends Season 1, was super hit and skyrocketed to become a phenomenon in the Mandarin music market. On top of Mandopop fans, it was exceptionally popular among the kids. With less than two years since its release, the song has garnered over 8.4 billion streams, making it the biggest digital song in UMG China’s history.

More than 28 years after Chan&#x27;s debut, he kept releasing new albums, such as &quot;Chin Up!&quot;&quot;&quot;, and going on his Fear and Dreams world tour in 2023. “Homo Sapiens”, a Cantonese song from &quot;Chin Up!&quot;&quot;&quot;, was awarded at the 34th Golden Melody Awards for Best Lyrics. This was the first time that a Cantonese song won this award.

Chan released a Chinese theme song again for Riot Games&#x27; series Arcane: League of Legends Season 2 in November 2024. The song &quot;Isha&#x27;s Song&quot; (這樣很好) was featured in the official Arcane Season Two soundtrack.

===Concerts===
Chan has held eight major theme concert series at the famous Hong Kong Coliseum starting from 1999. His first series of four concerts at the Coliseum, &quot;Eason&#x27;s 99 Big Live,&quot; came four years after his debut in 1995. That amount of time was considered short for a new singer to gain general approval and public support needed to perform at such a prestigious venue. Two years later in 2001, Chan held a series of nine &quot;The Easy Ride&quot; concerts under the wing of his second record company, Music Plus. In 2003, he held a series of seven &quot;The Third Encounter&quot; concerts with the support of Music Plus. In the spring of 2006, after a year of rest and another change of record company, Chan held his fourth theme concert series, a total of nine &quot;Get a Life&quot; concerts. A year later, Chan broke his own record while holding his fifth series of concerts named &quot;Eason&#x27;s Moving on Stage&quot;. During October and November 2007, he completed a total of 16 hugely successful Chan&#x27;s Moving on Stage1 concerts.

Chan embarked another series of concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum, named &quot;DUO&quot; (18 shows), &quot;Eason&#x27;s Life&quot; (25 shows), and &quot;Fear and Dreams&quot; (27 shows) in 2010, 2013 and 2022 respectively. As of January 2023, Chan held over 110 concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum.

===Tours===
Chan began his Moving on Stage World Tour in February 2008. He traveled to Taiwan, Canada, Australia, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Malaysia, Macau, Singapore, Kunming, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hangzhou, Guiyang, Beijing, and Foshan. Chan&#x27;s Moving on Stage World Tour ended with Eason Chan&#x27;s Moving on Stage 26 at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 16 August 2009.

Months after his Moving On Stage Concerts came to finish, Chan began another tour in mainland China, called &quot;Ninety Minutes of Bliss&quot;. Instead of playing at grand venues, Chan played at smaller venues in order to get closer to his fans. He completed two concerts in Nanjing and three more in Shanghai before and during Christmas 2009. Two more concerts were held in Beijing on 29 and 30 May in 2010.

In between his tours, Chan held his sixth record-breaking Theme Concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum for a total of 18 concerts, scheduled from 20 March to 6 April 2010. This new series was called &quot;Duo Eason Chan 2010 Concert&quot; (《&quot;DUO陳奕迅2010演唱會&quot;》).

After the May &quot;Ninety Minutes of Bliss&quot; concerts in Beijing, Chan went to Europe for his first European tour scheduled. He visited three cities over the course of 5 days: London, Manchester, and Rotterdam. The venues for the three concerts were, respectively, Royal Albert Hall, Manchester Apollo and Rotterdam Ahoy. Tickets to his London and Manchester concerts were each sold out within hours of ticket release. Chan is the second Hong Kong singer after Roman Tam to perform in the prestigious Royal Albert Hall.

At Chan&#x27;s concert in Beijing on 29 September 2011 at the Beijing Workers&#x27; Stadium, Faye Wong made a special guest appearance, surprising many as Wong had not previously accepted any invitations to appear as a special guest at another singer&#x27;s concert; this was the first time that she did so.

Continuing his &quot;Duo Eason Chan 2010 Concert&quot; World Tour, Chan made his second appearance in London, the O2 Arena on 23 April 2012. He became the first Chinese artist playing in the O2 stage. The concert was sold out in twenty minutes to 12,000 fans crashing the venue&#x27;s web servers.

In 2015, Chan held his 100th show of Another Eason Life&#x27;s World Tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 4 December 2015. This was the first time ever that a Hongkongese singer performed at the Centre Bell. The tour ended late in 2016, as he took a break from concert touring.

In September 2017, Chan began a new tour called &quot;Eason Says C&#x27;mon in~&quot; &quot;Tour&quot;, which was noted for performing in small stadiums like Macpherson Stadium, Hong Kong, which could only seat about 2,500 people. This tour was to promote his new album “C’mon in~”, visiting 18 cities around the world, with 19 shows held across Asia, Europe, America, which was never been done before by any Hong Kong artist.

On 21 November 2019, it was announced that &quot;Fear and Dreams&quot; concerts would be cancelled because of unstable circumstances in Hong Kong. &quot;Fear and Dreams&quot; tour resumed in Hong Kong Coliseum from 9 December 2022 to January 2023, marking him performing as a solo act in the venue since Eason&#x27;s Life tour in 2013. &quot;Fear and Dream&quot; world tour embarked in April 2023. The tour, so far, covered Taiwan, South East Asia, North America, Macau, and mainland China. He was the first Asian singer performing at Chase Center, San Francisco.

On May 25, 2024, after play the 100th show of the &quot;Fear and Dreams&quot; tour and the fourth of six shows in Hangzhou, Chan announced in person that the next two shows, scheduled for May 25 and 26, will be postponed to May 27 and 28 because his doctors had advised him to rest his vocal chords. His voice was hoarse when he spoke. The two shows were postponed again when Chan shared on Weibo on May 26 that his vocal chords have not improved. The new dates are to be determined. Chan had to postpone his shows again when he fainted from heatstroke while playing tennis outdoor on June 10. He fractured his cheekbone and suffered a deep cut on his chin that required 30 stitches; recovery was estimated to be three weeks. As a result, his six upcoming shows in Chongqing in June were postponed to 2025. The tour resumed in August 2024 after recovery. Chan would later cancel the Bangkok stop, originally to be held on February 22, 2025 at the Impact Arena, of the tour due to concerns of safety of his fans after a Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted by a scam group in Bangkok.

=== Musical ===
On 18 and 19 August 2005, Chan performed the musical &quot;Wrestling with God&quot; (人神鬥), the second programme of &quot;Love Music Tour 2005&quot; organised by Netvigator. He was the actor and producer. Stars featured in the show included famous comedian Jim Chim (詹瑞文), singer Wilfred Lau (劉浩龍), Taiwanese singer Mavis Fan (范曉萱), &quot;Best Supporting Actress Winner&quot; of the &quot;23rd Hong Kong Film Awards&quot; Josie Ho (何超儀), pop duo at17 and Soler. The story was about the competition among different angels (played by the featured stars) to protect the only man alive in the world (played by Eason Chan). The secret guest, veteran singer George Lam (林子祥), played Chan&#x27;s late father. The audience were impressed by the performers, who told the story through song and dance.

===Support for Xinjiang-sourced cotton===
On 25 March 2021, Chan&#x27;s company, My Kan Wonderland Limited announced on Weibo that the company would &quot;resolutely boycott any behaviour vilifying China&quot; and that the company would terminate its role as a brand ambassador for Adidas, leading to public backlash against Chan. The announcement came after Adidas and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative had publicly resolved to not use cotton sourced from Xinjiang and also following a BBC investigation that found that Uyghur forced labor was being used in the production of cotton in the region. The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported that, after the announcement was made, Chan&#x27;s Facebook page, which did not mention the boycott, was flooded with &quot;thousands [of] comments sharply critical of the move&quot; and that &quot;[a]ccording to the United Nations, human rights groups and victim testimonials, China has placed at least 1 million Uygurs and other ethnic minorities in high security camps, where they are subjected to indoctrination, torture and forced labour.&quot; China maintains that claims of forced labor in Xinjiang are &quot;entirely fabricated&quot;.

<text>The Selkirk Mountains are a mountain range spanning the northern portion of the Idaho Panhandle, eastern Washington, and southeastern British Columbia which are part of a larger grouping of mountains, the Columbia Mountains. They begin at Mica Peak and Krell Hill near Spokane and extend approximately 320 km north (200 miles) from the border to Kinbasket Lake, at the now-deserted location of the onetime fur company post, Boat Encampment. The range is bounded on its west, northeast and at its northern extremity by the Columbia River, or the reservoir lakes now filling most of that river&#x27;s course. From the Columbia&#x27;s confluence with the Beaver River, they are bounded on their east by the &quot;Purcell Trench&quot;, which contains the Beaver River, Duncan River, Duncan Lake, Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River. The Selkirks are distinct from, and geologically older than, the Rocky Mountains. The neighboring Monashee and Purcell Mountains, and sometimes including the Cariboo Mountains to the northwest, are also part of the larger grouping of mountains known as the Columbia Mountains. A scenic highway loop, the International Selkirk Loop, encircles the southern portions of the mountain range.

The Selkirks were named after Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk.

==Modern history==

In 1857 gold was discovered in the Selkirks. Coal, copper, marble, mercury, silver, and zinc were also found in the mountains. During the development of Western Canada, the Selkirks presented a formidable barrier to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, until A.B. Rogers discovered the mountain pass that bears his name in 1881–1882. As a result of the railway&#x27;s construction via that route, Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks (Canada) in the heart of the Selkirks were among the first national parks created in Canada, along with Yoho and Banff National Parks in the Rockies. Until the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway via the Rogers Pass, automotive traffic between most of British Columbia and the rest of Canada necessarily was forced to follow the path of the Columbia River via its Big Bend, around the north end of the Selkirks.

==Fauna==
This area, some of it protected in Washington&#x27;s Salmo-Priest Wilderness, is also home to mule deer and white-tailed deer, elk, black bears, cougars, bobcats, red fox, bald eagles, golden eagles, osprey, great blue heron, porcupine, badgers, coyote, martens, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, gray wolves and moose. Formerly rarely seen, grizzly bears are also known to roam through this region now in abundance.

===South Selkirk mountain caribou===
The southern end of the Selkirk Mountains was the home of the last naturally occurring caribou herd in the contiguous United States, the South Selkirk mountain caribou. The herd was cross boundary, spending some time in extreme northern Idaho, eastern Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. The South Selkirk mountain caribou is a woodland mountain caribou, an ecotype of the boreal woodland caribou, one of the most critically endangered mammals.

In 2009 the herd of 50 animals was declining. Predation from wolves that had been reintroduced to the area negatively effected the herd, and by April 2018, only three remained, and in January 2019, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) announced in its scientific journal, &quot;Science&quot;, that British Columbia&#x27;s provincial biologists captured the female caribou in Canada and moved her to a captive rearing pen near Revelstoke in the hopes of &quot;preserving highly endangered herds&quot;. According to the AAAS, it is believed that this female caribou is the &quot;last member of the last herd to regularly cross into the lower 48 states from Canada&quot;.

<text>Nelson Ndukwe Akwari (born February 4, 1982, in Houston, Texas) is a retired American soccer player. He began his career with the United States national team youth academy in Bradenton, Florida, and played for several professional clubs in various U.S. leagues.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Akwari attended Strake Jesuit College Preparatory, a private school in Houston, before attending USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy, where he trained with other Under-17 national teamers like Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Bobby Convey.

Although he considered turning pro, Akwari instead went to UCLA to play college soccer. He stayed at UCLA two years, starting every game as a freshman in 2000, and being named second-team All-Pac-10 as a sophomore.

He returned to UCLA after completion of his soccer career and earned Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorate degrees in engineering.

===Professional===
Akwari left college after his sophomore year to pursue opportunities in Europe, but when nothing came of them, he signed a Project-40 contract with MLS late in the 2002 season. Akwari was put into a lottery, which the MetroStars won; Akwari appeared in seven games and was traded during the offseason to the Columbus Crew. Akwari saw little playing time in 2003, appearing in 11 games but starting only five for the Crew, while spending a lot of time on loan to A-League&#x27;s Cincinnati Riverhawks. In his third year in the league, Akwari began to show much more of the promise that he had as a youth national teamer - he took possession of the starting right back position midseason, and remained there for the rest of the year, ending the season with 16 starts as the Crew won the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield.

After the 2004 season, Akwari was selected tenth overall by Real Salt Lake in the Expansion Draft, reuniting him with old coach John Ellinger. Akwari played 41 games over the 2005 and 2006 seasons.

Akwari signed for USL Second Division side Charlotte Eagles in April 2007, and scored on his debut against Crystal Palace Baltimore on April 20, 2007. He then signed for Charleston Battery in 2008, spending two seasons with the club including a run to the final of the 2008 US Open Cup.

Akwari signed on 26 January 2010 for the Canadian club Vancouver Whitecaps a one-year contract. He scored his first professional goal for Vancouver on April 29, 2010, in a game against the Portland Timbers. On October 19, 2010, the Vancouver Whitecaps released Akwari. Akwari joined the expansion Los Angeles Blues in the USL Pro league for the 2011 season.

Akwari retired following the 2011 season and settled in Charleston, where he works as a senior engineering director for Boeing and is a frequent commentator on Battery game broadcasts.

===International===
Akwari has represented the United States at the U-17, U-20 and U-23 levels, playing at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand, and the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina.
