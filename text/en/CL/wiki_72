<text>Education in Mexico has a long history. Indigenous peoples created institutions such as the telpochcalli and the calmecac. The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, the second oldest university in the Americas, was founded by royal decree in 1551. Education in Mexico was, until the early twentieth century, largely confined to males from urban and wealthy segments and under the auspices of the Catholic Church.

The Mexican state has been directly involved in education since the nineteenth century, promoting secular education. Control of education was a source of an ongoing conflict between the Mexican state and the Catholic Church, which since the colonial era had exclusive charge of education. The mid-nineteenth-century Liberal Reform separated church and state, which had a direct impact on education. President Benito Juárez sought the expansion of public schools. During the long tenure of President Porfirio Díaz, the expansion of education became a priority under a cabinet-level post held by Justo Sierra; Sierra also served President Francisco I. Madero in the early years of the Mexican Revolution.

The 1917 Constitution strengthened the Mexican state&#x27;s power in education. During the presidency of Álvaro Obregón in the early 1920s, his Minister of Public Education José Vasconcelos implemented a massive expansion of access to public, secular education and expanded access to secular schooling in rural areas. This work was built on and expanded in the administration of Plutarco Elías Calles by Moisés Sáenz. In the 1930s, the Mexican government under Lázaro Cárdenas mandated socialist education in Mexico and there was considerable push back from the Catholic Church. Socialist education was repealed during the 1940s, with the administration of Manuel Ávila Camacho. A number of private universities have opened since the mid-twentieth century. The Mexican Teachers&#x27; Union (SNTE), founded in the late 1940s, has had significant political power. The Mexican federal government has undertaken measures to reform education, which have been opposed by the SNTE.

Education in Mexico is currently regulated by the Secretariat of Public Education () (SEP). Education standards are set by this Ministry at all levels except in &quot;autonomous&quot; universities chartered by the government (e.g., Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México). Accreditation of private schools is accomplished by mandatory approval and registration with this institution. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain private schools, which receive no public funds.

In the same fashion as other education systems, education has identifiable stages: primary school, junior high school (or secondary school), high school, higher education, and postgraduate education.

==Structure of the basic education system==

In Mexico, basic education is normally divided into three steps: primary school (&quot;primaria&quot;), comprising grades 1–6; junior high school (&quot;secundaria&quot;), comprising grades 7-9; and high school (&quot;preparatoria&quot;), comprising grades 10-12.

Depending on definitions, primary education comprises &quot;primaria&quot; and &quot;secundaria&quot;, which are compulsory by law, while secondary education only includes &quot;preparatoria&quot;, which has recently been made compulsory.

===Primary school===

The terms &quot;Primary School&quot; or &quot;Elementary School&quot; usually corresponds to &quot;primaria&quot;, comprising grades 1–6, when the students are 6 to 12 years old. It starts the basic compulsory education system. These are the first years of schooling.

Depending on the school, bilingual education may be offered from the beginning, where half the day instruction is in Spanish, and the rest is in another language.

===Junior high school===

The terms &quot;Junior High School&quot; or &quot;Middle School&quot; usually correspond to &quot;secundaria&quot;, comprising grades 7–9 when the student&#x27;s age is 12 to 15 years old. It is part of the basic compulsory education system, following primary school and coming before &quot;high school&quot; (&quot;preparatoria&quot;).

At this level, more specialized subjects may be taught such as Physics, Chemistry, and World History.
There is also the &quot;técnica&quot; which provides vocational training, and the &quot;telesecundaria&quot; which provides distance learning.

Despite the similarities of the words &quot;Secondary school&quot; and &quot;secundaria&quot;, in Mexico the former is usually translated to &quot;preparatoria&quot;, while in other countries, such as Puerto Rico, or within the Spanish-speaking populations of the United States, the term &quot;secundaria&quot; refers to university.

===High school===

The term &quot;High School&quot; usually corresponds to &quot;preparatoria&quot; or &quot;bachillerato&quot;, and follows &quot;secundaria&quot; comprising grades 10–12, when the student&#x27;s age is 15 to 18 years old. Students may choose between two main kinds of high school programs: The SEP incorporated, and a University Incorporated one, depending on the state. Another minority of programs are available only for private schools, such as the International Baccalaureate which carries a completely different system. Nevertheless, in order to be taught, it must include at least one national subject. In addition, there are programs such as &quot;tecnología&quot; and &quot;comercio&quot; that prepare students for a particular vocational career.

&quot;Preparatoria&quot; traditionally consists of three years of education, divided into six semesters, with the first semesters having a common curriculum, and the latter ones allowing some degree of specialization, either in physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) or social sciences (commerce, philosophy, law, etc.). The term &quot;preparatoria&quot; is most commonly used for institutions that offer a three-year education program that &quot;prepares&quot; the student with general knowledge to continue studying at a university. In contrast, the term &quot;bachillerato&quot; is most often used for institutions that provide vocational training, in two or three years, so the graduate can get a job as a skilled worker, for example, an assistant accountant, a bilingual secretary or a technician. An example of an institution that provides this kind of skills in Mexico is the National College of Professional Technical Education (Conalep).

== Educational integration ==

In 1993, educational integration was formally implemented nationwide through the reform article 41 of the General Education Law. This law mandates the integration of students with special needs into regular classrooms. Although formally, the term &#x27;educational integration&#x27; is used, &#x27;inclusive education&#x27; is often used to describe the educational system. Implementation of educational integration has taken many years and still continues to face obstacles. Under the current model, students with severe disabilities that would not benefit from inclusion, study the same curriculum as regular classrooms in separate schools called Centros de Atencion Multiple [Multiple Attention Center], or CAM. Otherwise, special needs students are placed in regular classrooms and are supported by the Unidades de Servicio y Apoyo a la Educación Regular or the Unit of Support Services for Regular Education, (USAER). This group is made up of special education teachers, speech therapists, psychologists and other professionals to help special needs students in the classroom and minimize barriers to their learning.

=== Challenges to educational integration ===

The combination of USAER professionals and regular teaching working in the same classroom has caused some issues for educational integration. Specifically, there is confusion about the roles of USAER professionals who work in regular classrooms. A study of USAER members found that regardless of urban or rural contexts, professionals had four common concerns. First, USAER professionals felt that they lacked preparation for working in the classroom. The second issue was feeling like their role had changed due to more demands being placed on them. The last two concerns were the lack of communication and collaboration between teachers and USAER professionals. Although the two work in the same classroom, they often work independently. However, this creates problems when adjusting the curriculum for special needs students.

Accessibility is another challenge for educational integration. Schools are required to have accessible buildings and classrooms, provide technical support and appropriate materials for special needs students, but a case study found that the school was not equipped for students with sensory disabilities. The school lacked accessible furniture, handicapped restrooms or proper modification for students with sensory disabilities.

Finally, training for new teachers doesn&#x27;t provide them enough experience with special needs students, making the shift to educational integration difficult. A study of 286 pre-service teachers found that a third of didn&#x27;t have any experience working with special needs students. Additionally, 44% of the teachers reported having no formal training in working with this population. A qualitative study on pre-service teachers assessed their attitude towards special needs students and their self-efficacy found that overall most teachers have positive perceptions of inclusive education. However, teachers with more hours of training, more teaching experience, and better knowledge of policies had higher levels of confidence in working with students with disabilities.

==Quality of education in Mexico==

In recent years, the progression through Mexican education has come under much criticism. While over 90% of children in Mexico attend primary school, only 62% attend secondary school. Only 45% finish secondary school. After secondary school, only a quarter pass on to higher education. A commonly cited reason for this is the lack of infrastructure throughout the rural schools. Moreover, the government has been criticized for investing too little in students, relative to budget. In its 2012 report on education, the OECD placed Mexico at below average in mathematics, science, and reading.

A program of education reform was enacted in February 2013 which provided for a shift in control of the education system from the teachers union SNTE and its political leader, Elba Esther Gordillo, to the central and state governments. Education in Mexico had been controlled by the teachers union and its leaders for many years. Shortly thereafter Gordillo was arrested on racketeering charges. the government continued to struggle with the union and its offshoot, CNTE.

==Higher education==

There are both public and private institutions of higher education. Higher education usually follows the US education model with an at least 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree undergraduate level (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;), and two degrees at the postgraduate level, a 2-year Master&#x27;s degree (&quot;Maestría&quot;), and a 3-year Doctoral degree (&quot;Doctorado&quot;), followed by the higher doctorate of Doctor of Sciences (&quot;Doctor en Ciencias&quot;). 
This structure of education very closely conforms to the Bologna Process started in Europe in 1999, allowing Mexican students to study abroad and pursue a master&#x27;s degree after &quot;Licenciatura&quot;, or a Doctoral degree after &quot;Maestría&quot;. 

Unlike other OECD countries, the majority of Mexico&#x27;s public universities do not accredit part-time enrollment programs.

===Undergraduate studies===

Undergraduate studies normally last at least 4 years, divided into semesters or quarters, depending on the college or university, and lead to a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;). According to OECD reports, 23% of Mexicans aged 23–35 have a college degree.

Although in theory every graduate of a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is a Licenciate (&quot;Licenciado&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Lic.&quot;) of his or her profession, it is common to use different titles for common professions such as Engineering and Architecture.
* Engineer, &quot;Ingeniero&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Ing.&quot;
**Electrical Engineer, &quot;Ingeniero Eléctrico&quot;
**Electronics Engineer, &quot;Ingeniero Electrónico&quot;
**Mechanical Engineer, &quot;Ingeniero Mecánico&quot;
**Computer Systems Engineer, &quot;Ingeniero en Sistemas Computacionales&quot;, abbreviated &quot;I.S.C.&quot;
* Architect, &quot;Arquitecto&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Arq.&quot;
* Licenciate, any degree, especially those from social sciences, &quot;Licenciado&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Lic.&quot;

===Postgraduate studies===

New regulations since 2005 divide postgraduate studies at Mexican universities and research centers into two main categories:
* Targeted at professional development
** &quot;Especialización&quot;. A 1-year course after a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;), which awards a Specialization Diploma (&quot;Diploma de Especialización&quot;).
** &quot;Maestría&quot;. A 2-year degree after a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;), which awards the title of Master (&quot;Maestro&quot;).
Targeted at scientific research
* &quot;Maestría en Ciencias&quot;. A 2-year degree after a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;), which awards the title of Master of Science (&quot;Maestro en Ciencias&quot;).
* &quot;Doctorado&quot;. A 3-year degree after a master&#x27;s degree (either &quot;Maestría&quot; or &quot;Maestría en Ciencias&quot;), or a 4-year degree directly after the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;) for high-achieving students. The Doctor of Sciences degree (&quot;Doctor en Ciencias&quot;) is equivalent to the higher doctorate awarded in countries such as Denmark, Ireland, the UK, and the former USSR countries.

=== Intercultural Universities ===
Intercultural Universities in Mexico were established in 2004 in response to the lack of enrollment of the indigenous population in the country. While an estimated 10% of the population of Mexico is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of higher education enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the Ministry of Education established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region.

== International education ==

, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Mexico as having 151 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including &quot;The Economist&quot;.

==Educational years==

===School years===
The table below describes the most common patterns for schooling in the state sector:



==History of education==

In central Mexico, the history of education stretches back to the Prehispanic era, with the education of Nahuas in schools for elites and commoners. A formal system of writing was created in various parts of central and southern Mexico, with trained experts in its practice. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, friars embarked on a widespread program of evangelization of Christianity. In the colonial era, schooling of elite men of European descent was established under the auspices of the Catholic Church. Liberals&#x27; attempts to separate church and state in post-independence Mexico included removal of the Catholic Church from education. Education remains an important aspect of Mexican institutional and cultural life, and conflicts continue about how it should be conducted. The history of education in Mexico gives insight into the larger history of the nation.

=== Education in Mesoamerica Before the Spanish ===
In central Mexico in the cultural area known as Mesoamerica, the Aztecs set up schools called calmecac for the training of warriors and schools for the training of priests, called &quot;cuicacalli&quot;. An early post-conquest manuscript prepared by native scribes for the viceroy of Mexico, Codex Mendoza shows these two types of schools. Aztec religion was highly complex and priests held a higher status, so that the creation of schools to train them in ritual and other aspects of religion was important. Overseeing an expansionist empire, Aztec rulers needed trained warriors, so that the creation of formal schools for their training was as important.

===Colonial-era education, 1521–1821===
====Education of the indigenous in Central Mexico====

The Spanish Crown made a significant commitment to education in colonial New Spain. The first efforts of schooling in Mexico were friars&#x27; evangelization of indigenous populations. &quot;Educating the native population was a crucial justification of the colonizing enterprise, and that &quot;criollo&quot; (Spanish American) culture was encouraged as a vehicle for integrating&quot; the indigenous. Fray Pedro de Gante established schools for indigenous in the immediate post-conquest years and produced pictorial texts to teach Catholic doctrine. All the mendicant orders in Mexico, the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, built churches in large indigenous communities as places of worship and to teach the catechism, so that large outdoor atriums functioned as classrooms. Elite indigenous lads were tapped for training as catechists and helpers to the priests, whose small numbers could in no way minister to large numbers of ordinary indigenous.

In 1536, the Franciscans and the Spanish crown established a school to train an indigenous Catholic priesthood, the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, which was deemed a failure in its goal of training priests, but did create a small cohort of indigenous men who were literate in their native language of Nahuatl, as well as Spanish and Latin. The Franciscans also founded the school of San José de los Naturales in Mexico City, which taught trades and crafts to boys. The Colegio de San Gregorio was also founded for the education of indigenous elites, the most famous of whom was Chimalpahin, (also known as Don Domingo Francisco de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin).

Religious orders, particularly the Franciscans, taught indigenous scribes in central Mexico to be literate in their own languages, allowing the creation of documents at the local level for colonial officials and communities to enable crown administration as well as production of last will and testaments, petitions to the crown, bills of sale, censuses and other types of legal record to be produced at the local level. The large number of indigenous language documents found in the archives in Mexico and elsewhere have enabled scholars of the New Philology to analyze life of Mexico&#x27;s colonial-era indigenous from indigenous perspectives. However, despite the large volume of documentation in indigenous languages, there is no evidence of that even elite indigenous women were literate.

====Education of elite Creole men====

The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico was founded in September 1551 at the request by Mexico&#x27;s first viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza to the Spanish crown. The university was located in the central core (&quot;traza&quot;) of History of Mexico City. By comparison, Harvard College, the oldest in the United States, was founded in 1636 and the oldest Canadian University, Université Laval dates from 1663. Its first rector, Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, wrote an account of the university. The institution initially trained in priests, lawyers, and starting in 1579, medical doctors. These were the traditional disciplines of the medieval and early modern eras. The Royal and Pontifical University was the sole institution that could confer academic degrees. With the title of royal and pontifical university, its degrees were titled the same as European degrees. The Jesuits arrived in Mexico in 1571 and rapidly founded schools and colegios, and sought to confer degrees; however, the Council of the Indies, the royal entity overseeing the Spanish overseas empire, decided against them.

The university retained its premier position. One of its best-known graduates was Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, a Mexican savant of the seventeenth century, who was a friend of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a cloistered nun and intellectual, famous in her lifetime as the &quot;Tenth Muse.&quot; Sor Juana was barred from attending the university due to her gender.

In general, educational institutions were urban-based, with the capital Mexico City having the largest concentration. However, there were seminaries to train priests in provincial cities, such as the Colegio de San Nicolás, founded by Bishop Vasco de Quiroga in the city now called Morelia. Insurgent leader Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla served as rector there until he was relieved of his position. One of his students was insurgent leader Father José María Morelos. Educated priests were prominent in the movement toward independence from Spain.

====Education of girls and mixed-race children====

Most of the Mexican population was illiterate and entirely unschooled, and there was no priority for the education of girls. A few girls in cities attended schools run by cloistered nuns. Some entered convent schools at around age eight, &quot;to remain cloistered for the rest of their lives.&quot; There were some schools connected to orphanages or confraternities. Private tutors educated girls from wealthy families, but only enough so that they could oversee a household. There were few opportunities for mixed-race boys or girls. &quot;Education was, in short, highly selective as befits a stratified society, and the possibilities of self-realization were a lottery of birth rather than talent.&quot;

===National period – 1821–present===
During the colonial era, education was under the control of the Catholic Church. Liberalism emerged as an ideology in the post-independence period, with a major tenet being public secular education. Conflict in the realm of education has been an ongoing issue in Mexican history since the Catholic Church sought to retain its role in this sphere, while liberals have sought to undermine the Church&#x27;s role. Since the 1940s, Catholic universities have re-emerged. Unionized school teachers have become a powerful force in the late twentieth and early twenty-first-century Mexican politics.

===Post-Independence Era, 1821–1850===
When Antonio López de Santa Anna put his Liberal vice president Valentín Gómez Farías in charge of running the government, the vice president created in 1833 a public education system. This preceded the establishment of a Ministry of Public Education. This reform was short-lived, but with the Liberal Reform in the mid-nineteenth century, a normal school for teacher training was established. The Liberals push for public education awaited the end of the War of the Reform and the ousting of the French Empire in Mexico (1862–67). The restored Republic of President Benito Juárez reaffirmed the Liberals principle of separation of church and state, which in the educational sphere meant supplanting the Catholic Church by the Mexican state. Primary education in Mexico was henceforth to be secular, free of fees and tuition, and obligatory.

===Reform era, 1850–1876===

A key figure in higher education in Mexico was Gabino Barreda, who chaired Juárez&#x27;s commission on education in 1867. Barreda was a follower of French intellectual Auguste Comte who established positivism the dominant philosophical school in the late nineteenth century. The Juárez government created a system of secondary education, and a key institution was the National Preparatory School (&quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria&quot;), founded in 1868 in Mexico City, which Barreda directed. Education at the Preparatoria was uniform for all students and &quot;designed to fill what José Díaz Covarrubias identified as the traditional void between primary and professional training.&quot;

===Porfiriato, 1876–1910===

During the Porfiriato (1876–1910), the era of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s presidency, secular, public education was a priority for the government, since it was seen as a vehicle for changes in behavior that would benefit the government&#x27;s commitment to progress. The number of schools expanded and the federal government expanded centralized control. Municipal governments had to yield control to state governments, and the federal bureaucracy for public schooling was established under the Ministry of Education, a cabinet-level position. More money was spent on public schools in this era, increasing faster than other public expenditures. Public schooling was part of Mexico&#x27;s project of modernization, to create an educated workforce. Those overseeing schools sought to instill the virtues of punctuality, thrift, valuable work habits, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco use, and gambling, along with creating a literate population. Although these were a lofty aim, implementation was hampered by teachers who were poorly trained. Illiteracy was widespread, with the 1910 census indicating only 33% of men and 27% of women were literate. Few students went on to secondary or post-secondary education. &quot;Porfirian schools were more important in their production of middle-class talent for the post-revolutionary educational and cultural efforts than they were in transforming popular behavior and illiteracy.&quot; However, the government&#x27;s commitment to education under Justo Sierra was an important step. He established the secular, state-controlled Universidad Nacional de México; The Pontifical University of Mexico under religious authority was suppressed in 1865.

Women entered the teaching profession, which was considered a proper one for women who worked outside the home. Although the schools were aimed at creating an educated populace envisioned by Porfirian elites, quite a number of school teachers were active in opposing the Díaz regime and participated in the Mexican Revolution, including Pascual Orozco and Plutarco Elías Calles. Women school teachers were important in the nascent women&#x27;s rights movement, such as Rita Cetina Gutiérrez and Dolores Jiménez y Muro.

===1920–1940===
Following the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), the government made a major commitment to public education under its control. Centralization of education was via the federal Ministry of Education (&quot;Secretaria de Educación Pública&quot; or SEP). José Vasconcelos became its head in 1921 and proceeded to enact a wide range of educational programs, including indigenous education. The so-called &quot;Indian problem,&quot; the lack of incorporation of Mexico&#x27;s indigenous population into the nation as citizens, was an issue that the SEP tackled. Indigenous children were not to be taught in separate schools in their own languages but taught in Spanish along with non-indigenous, mestizo students. An early program was the formation of &quot;Missionaries of Indigenous Culture and Public Education,&quot; which had the aim of imparting a secular worldview emphasizing &quot;community development, modernization, and incorporation into the mestizo mainstream.&quot;
The federal government took over schools run by Mexican states and enrollments for rural primary schools increased significantly. Public schools became a means for the government to directly influence the countryside ideologically through education of the next generations. Public school teachers saw themselves &quot;as part of a mystical crusade for the nation, modernity, and social justice,&quot; but SEP personnel often held campesinos and rural culture in contempt. In the 1930s, during the early presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40) there was a push for &quot;socialist education&quot; at all levels. The policy made public schools sources of anti-religious ideology fueling resistance by Catholics.

The government expanded normal schools for teacher training after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. As the federal government consolidated power through the formation of the National Revolutionary Party (PNR) in 1928 and its new iteration in 1936, the Mexican Revolutionary Party (PRM), teachers played an important role in the creation of national worker and national peasant organizations. Public education &quot;contributed to the consolidation of an authoritarian single-party regime.&quot;

When the Mexican government implemented its policy of socialist education, it directly targeted religious-affiliated, private schooling. Students in these schools were barred from receiving valid educational certification, which effectively prevented many from entering professions. The aim of socialist education was to create a &quot;useful and efficient worker capable of assuming leadership of the national economy, employing methods of modern science with a profound consciousness of collective responsibility ... an indispensable precondition for the coming of a state in the hands of the working classes.&quot; The conflict was violent at the National University in Mexico City, which in 1929 had become autonomous from government control, but there was also conflict at regional universities as well, mainly student strikes. Cárdenas backed away from socialist education. Catholic student groups&#x27; mobilization against socialist education had lasting consequences, with leaders in the Catholic Student Union playing an important role in the founding of the conservative, pro-Catholic National Action Party in 1939.

===Education, post-1940===
When President Cárdenas chose Manuel Avila Camacho as his successor, he chose a moderate, particularly on church-state issues where education was contentious. In office, Avila Camacho ended socialist education. Initially, the Ministry of Education continued various policies from the Cárdenas era, but with Avila Camacho&#x27;s appointment of Jaime Torres Bodet as head of the SEP, government policy sought to raise educational standards and invest in teacher training. Torres Bodet founded the National Institute of Teacher Training. He sought to create a curriculum that was nationalist and democratic. &quot;Education was to be secular, free of religious doctrine, and based on scientific truths.&quot;
During the period ca. 1940–1960, Mexico experienced sustained economic growth, the so-called Mexican Miracle, which saw increased urbanization and industrialization. The idea that education was a determinant of economic development took hold and the government of President Adolfo López Mateos, who appointed Torres Bodet Minister of Education. Torres Bodet made a comprehensive assessment of Mexican education, which led to the Eleven-Year Plan for Education, attempting to make a commitment that forced the next president to continue implementation. The assessment of Mexican primary-level schools showed that 50% of Mexican children, or 3 million, had access to primary education. Of those, fewer than 25% finished fourth grade. Only about 1,000 of those primary school students would succeed in pursuing a profession. A basic finding was that only 50% of Mexicans could read or write. López Mateos sought reforms to remedy the situation, including training 27,000 more teachers and building more schools. He also created a program to provide free textbooks to students and made their use obligatory in schools.

In 1949, Mexican teachers formed a national union that was affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and came to be a powerful bloc within it. The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), (National Union of Education Workers) was formed as a section within the umbrella organization of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), the labor sector of the dominant party. In the late 1930s, teachers had begun to form unions that were eventually brought into the SNTE.

In 1968, when Mexico hosted the Olympic Games in the capital, there were widespread demonstrations against spending so much on such an event, when there were higher national priorities. University students participated in a major way in these demonstrations, with the government reacting violently in the Tlatelolco massacre of October 1968. In June 1971, there was further student activism in Mexico City that resulted in more violent government repression, known as the Corpus Christi massacre. Recognizing that failures in the educational system was a cause of the 1968 student activism, the government of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (1964–1970) attempted to implement educational reform as part of a wider social reform. The government sought to reach Mexicans who had not had access to education previously and the use of radio and television were seen as ways to do this. Adult education became a focus of the expansion. With the presidency of Luis Echeverría (1970–1976), the expansion included the use of telenovelas (soap operas) to shape public understandings, and Mexico became a pioneer in the use of this medium for policy matters. Better health care in earlier years had resulted in a population boom as infant mortality declined and fertility increased. With Catholic Church opposition to birth control, the secular format of telenovela were a means to bring a message of the benefits of family planning to women.
The government sought to strengthen higher education particularly in the sciences and technology, establishing the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) in 1970. It funds fellowships for graduate students to study abroad to increase their specialized knowledge. Despite sustained government efforts over several presidential administrations, Mexican education had not significantly affected low education levels and high levels of illiteracy in the country, especially in rural areas. In 1978, engineer and Mexican politic José Antonio Padilla Segura, founded the National College of Professional Technical Education (Conalep), with its main objective being oriented to the training of technical professionals, graduates of secondary school.

President José López Portillo (1976–1982) created a National Literacy Program (&quot;Pronalf&quot;) in 1980 and then established an independent institute for adult education (Instituto Nacional de Educación para Adultos INEA). With the collapse of the Mexican economy during the oil crisis of 1982, educational reform awaited economic recovery. In 1992, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who became president in the disputed 1988 elections, instituted changes in the organization of Mexico&#x27;s educational system. Adopting neoliberal economic policies to promote development, Salinas saw education as a key factor. In an accord with the SNTE, education was decentralized from its control by the Ministry of Public Education (SEP) and came under the control of the Mexican state government. Curriculum reform was also undertaken by the SEP, which included the creation of new textbooks. Protests resulted in the government&#x27;s withdrawing the textbooks. A third component of the accord was the creation of a system of merit pay for teachers.
The SNTE grew to be the largest labor union in Latin America, and its head, Elba Esther Gordillo considered the most powerful woman in Mexican politics. The lack of democracy within the teachers&#x27; union has been as a source of conflict. Also a source of conflict is union opposition to reforms that undercut union power over teaching positions. In 2012, some teachers from rural areas, specifically, from Michoacan and Guerrero states, opposed federal regulations that prevented them from automatic lifetime tenure, the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills. Gordillo, head of the SNTE since 1989, was arrested in 2013 as she got off her private airplane in Toluca airport, and charged with corruption.

School attendance has increased over the years. In 1950, Mexico had only three million students enrolled in education. In 2011, there were 32 million enrolled students. The 1960 national census illustrates the historically poor performance of the Mexican educational system. As to all Mexicans over the age of five, the census found 43.7% had not completed one year of school, 50.7% had completed six years or less of school, and only 5.6% had continued their education beyond six years of school. In 2015, 96.2% of six to fourteen year-olds attended school, up from 91.3% in 2000. The state with the highest attendance rate was Hidalgo (97.8%) and the state with the lowest was Chiapas (93%). In the same year, 63% of three to five year-olds attended preschool or kindergarten, up from 52.3% in 2010. Also in 2015, 44% of 15 to 24 year-olds attended secondary or tertiary school, an increase from 32.8% in 2000.

In 2004, the literacy rate was at 97% for youth under the age of 14 and 91% for people over 15, placing Mexico at the 24th place in the world rank according to UNESCO. In 2018, Mexico&#x27;s literacy rate was 94.86%, up from 82.99% in 1980, with the literacy rates of males and females being relatively equal.

In February 2019, the SEP commemorated the establishment of the program for free textbooks with a publication noting the inclusion of art by Mexicans in successive textbook editions.

The National Autonomous University of Mexico ranks 103th in the QS World University Rankings, making it the highest ranked university in Mexico, after it comes the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education as the highest ranked private school in Mexico and 158th worldwide in 2019. Private business schools also stand out in international rankings. IPADE and EGADE, the business schools of Universidad Panamericana and of Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education respectively, were ranked in the top 10 in a survey conducted by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; among recruiters outside the United States.

<text>Star Trek Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Cryptic Studios based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The game is set in the 25th century, 30 years after the events of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; is the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and was released for Microsoft Windows in February 2010. At launch, the game required a game purchase and a recurring monthly fee. In January 2012, it relaunched with a tier of free-to-play access available. After a public beta testing period, a version of the game was released for OS X in March 2014. Due to technical issues with the port, support for OS X ended in February 2016. It was later released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in September 2016. The game has received several expansions since release and has gotten mixed reviews from critics. 

==Setting==
&quot;Star Trek Online&quot; is set thirty years after the events of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. The alliance between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire has collapsed, and they are again at war. The Romulan Star Empire continues to deal with the fallout of the loss of their homeworld twenty-two years earlier (as shown in J. J. Abrams&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; film), while the Dominion rebuilds its forces. The Borg Collective has re-emerged as a major threat. In later expansions the Vaadwaur, the Iconians, the Na&#x27;Kuhl, the Krenim, the Terran Empire, the Voth, the Undine, the Tzenkethi and the Hur&#x27;q are also introduced as adversaries.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, each player acts as the captain of their own ship. Players are able to play as a starship, controlling the ship&#x27;s engineering, tactical, and science systems by keyboard/mouse or using an on-screen console. Players can also &quot;beam down&quot; and move around as a player character in various settings with access to weapons and specific support and combat skills relating to their own characters&#x27; classes. The two combat systems are intertwined throughout the game: away-team missions feature fast-paced &quot;run-and-gun&quot; combat, while space combat stresses the long-term tactical aspect of combat between capital ships. Both are offered in concert with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; storyline and emphasize ship positioning to efficiently utilize shields during space combat, as well as the player&#x27;s away team&#x27;s positioning in consideration of flanking damage and finding various weaknesses to exploit during ground combat.

Other aspects of the game include crafting, which in its current form involves using duty officers (junior crew members) to make items, depending on the level of the school (category- such as science, beams, etc.) chosen. To raise the level of the school being researched, it is necessary to perform a research project using a crafting material. Unlike in some other MMO&#x27;s, crafting is a &quot;set-and-forget&quot; procedure. The player will set up the project, click a button and after a specified time the task will be completed, rather than spending time actually performing the crafting.

Duty Officers can also be sent on assignments which also follow the set and forget methodology, and are not available during the time the assignments are in progress.

Characters of level 52 and higher can send any ships they have, or have had, on admiralty missions, similar to duty officer assignments—but these do not use duty officers to perform them. Again, the mission is selected and a certain amount of specified time passes until the player is told it is complete, at which time they will be informed whether it was successful.

===Free-to-play===
On September 1, 2011, Cryptic Studios announced that &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; would switch to free-to-play, but without full access to all the items. Later, it was announced that free-to-play would be starting Tuesday January 17, 2012. Free-to-play for players with existing or cancelled subscriptions began Thursday January 5.

==Development==
Cryptic Studios officially announced the development of &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; on July 28, 2008, as a countdown timer on Cryptic&#x27;s web site reached zero and the new official site was launched. A letter was sent out from Jack Emmert, the game&#x27;s online producer, detailing some aspects of Cryptic&#x27;s approach.

Console versions were announced several months before the release, with no specific console platform specified, but Cryptic announced that all console versions of their games are on indefinite hold due to difficulties &quot;on the business side of things,&quot; largely referring to the fees assessed by Microsoft for their Xbox Gold premium online gaming service and the difficulty in asking a player to pay both that and the Cryptic subscription fee to play a single game. Console support, for both Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 was made available in September 2016. The initial release was in North American regions, but will be rolled out to additional regions in the Americas and Europe.

&quot;Star Trek Online&quot;″s closed beta test officially began when it was announced on October 22, 2009. Cryptic Studios offered guaranteed beta access to users who bought 6-month and lifetime subscriptions to Champions Online. However, the offer did not explicitly state how early in the beta process the access would be granted. Some pre-order packages included access to the &#x27;open beta&#x27; running from January 12––26, 2010.
=== Expansion pack: &quot;Legacy of Romulus&quot; ===

&quot;Legacy of Romulus&quot; is &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;″s first expansion pack, announced on March 21, 2013. A third playable faction, the Romulan Republic, was added, with the choice of Romulans or Remans (at present) as player characters, as they battle a mysterious new enemy and try to discover the secrets behind the destruction of Romulus two decades earlier. Denise Crosby, who reprised her role of Tasha Yar during STO&#x27;s third anniversary, reprised her role of Tasha&#x27;s daughter Sela, the Romulan Empress. Also featured is a complete leveling experience from level 1 to 50 (the current level cap) for the Romulans and for the Klingons, a Tholian reputation faction, a customizable UI, and an overhauled &quot;traits&quot; system.
&quot;Legacy of Romulus&quot; was released on May 21, 2013, between the Season 7 and Season 8 releases.
=== Expansion pack: &quot;Delta Rising&quot; ===

&quot;Delta Rising&quot; is &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;″s second expansion, announced at the Official &quot;Star Trek&quot; Convention in Las Vegas on August 2, 2014. Cryptic had hinted of a new expansion in December 2013, with a release &quot;late in 2014&quot;. The expansion is set in the Delta Quadrant, the main setting of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Tim Russ reprised his role as Admiral Tuvok, and he was joined by Garrett Wang as Captain Harry Kim of the USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (established in the &quot;Voyager&quot; series finale &quot;Endgame&quot;), Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine, Robert Picardo as the Doctor, and Ethan Phillips as Neelix. Lead Designer Al Rivera said that &quot;several&quot; &quot;Voyager&quot; cast members would appear in &quot;Delta Rising&quot;. The level cap was raised from 50 to 60, adding two new ranks for each faction: Admiral and Fleet Admiral for the Federation and the Romulan Republic, and General and Dahar Master for the Klingons. Several Delta Quadrant races that appeared in &quot;Voyager&quot; also were included in the new content, as well as a new tier of ships for the higher levels, and a Delta Reputation tree for players to progress through.
&quot;Delta Rising&quot; was released on October 14, 2014.

=== Expansion pack: &quot;Agents of Yesterday&quot; ===

&quot;Agents of Yesterday&quot; is &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;″s third expansion, announced on May 5, 2016, as the game&#x27;s contribution to the 50th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The expansion allows for the creation of Starfleet player characters from the era of the original series who become involved in an ongoing &quot;Temporal Cold War&quot; (a storyline that was introduced in &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and brought into STO with the &quot;Future Proof&quot; missions in Season 11) with the Na&#x27;kuhl species. Matt Winston reprised his role as Daniels, the temporal agent who fought alongside Captain Jonathan Archer to stop the Na&#x27;kuhl in several episodes of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He was also joined by Walter Koenig, reprising his role as Pavel Chekov, and Chris Doohan as Montgomery Scott, filling in for his late father, James Doohan. The expansion also intersects with the alternate timeline from the reboot series begun in 2009 by J. J. Abrams; Joseph Gatt reprises his role as the cyborg science officer 0718, who appeared in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;.
&quot;Agents of Yesterday&quot; was released on July 6, 2016.
=== Expansion pack: &quot;Victory is Life&quot; ===

&quot;Victory is Life&quot; is &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;″s fourth expansion, announced on March 21, 2018, as the game&#x27;s contribution to the 25th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The expansion opens up the Gamma Quadrant, accessible by the Bajoran wormhole, and also adds the Dominion as a playable faction, with the ability to create Jem&#x27;Hadar characters only. The Cardassians can also be unlocked for the Starfleet and Klingon Defense Force factions in the in-game store. Several &quot;DS9&quot; actors reprise their roles in the expansion, including René Auberjonois (Odo), Nana Visitor (Kira Nerys), Alexander Siddig (Dr. Julian Bashir), Armin Shimerman (Quark), Max Grodénchik (Rom), Chase Masterson (Leeta), Aron Eisenberg (Nog), Andrew Robinson (Elim Garak), J. G. Hertzler (Martok), Jeffrey Combs (Weyoun and Brunt), Salome Jens (the Female Changeling), and Bumper Robinson (Dukan&#x27;Rex, the Jem&#x27;Hadar youth who appeared in &quot;DS9&quot;″s third-season episode &quot;The Abandoned&quot;).

&quot;Victory is Life&quot; was released on June 5, 2018.

==Release and operations==

===Promotions===
Cryptic Studios partnered with several retailers for distribution of pre-order copies. Each retailer had a version with unique and exclusive content, such as a Borg Bridge Officer (Amazon), a classic Constitution-class starship (GameStop), Sniper Rifle (Target), Chromodynamic armor (Steam), 500 bonus skill points (Walmart), Neodymium deflector dish (SyFy), or a Tribble/Targ pet (Best Buy). All versions of the game came with access to the Open Beta and Head Start launch date.

In addition, the code for a &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; Admiral&#x27;s uniform is included in the DVD release of &quot;The Best of Star Trek: The Next Generation Volume 2&quot; and the Blu-ray release of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series – Season 3&quot;.

===Ownership===
&quot;Star Trek Online&quot; was originally owned by Cryptic Studios and published by Atari Interactive, along with sister title Champions Online. On May 17, 2011, Atari indicated that it no longer wanted to pursue MMORPG gaming and that it planned to sell Cryptic Studios. Later in the same month, Perfect World Entertainment purchased Cryptic Studios for $50.3 million and continued its operations.

In December 2021, Swedish holding company Embracer Group announced that it would acquire the North American and publishing arms of Perfect World Entertainment from Perfect World Europe through its Gearbox Software subsidiary. Following the acquisition, Perfect World Entertainment was renamed as Gearbox Publishing SF (San Francisco), who is now the current publisher for &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, while Cryptic will continue operations as a subsidiary of The Gearbox Entertainment Company. As of 2024, Gearbox Publishing SF has rebranded into Arc Games following the announcement of plans for Take-Two Interactive to acquire Gearbox, while Cryptic Studios was relocated to DECA Games.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Trek Online&quot; has received mixed reviews, garnering a 66 on Metacritic. GameSpot praised the game&#x27;s space combat as entertaining, but found the other aspects of the game to be &quot;bland and shallow&quot;. MMOify&#x27;s reviewer reviewed the game favorably but criticized many aspects of gameplay, including &quot;poor voice acting&quot; and repetitive quests. An IGN reviewer described the game experience as feeling like &quot;two games&quot; which did not mesh together well, and although visually it was &quot;quite a gorgeous game&quot;, found much of the gameplay to be repetitive in nature.

In 2016, Den of Geek ranked &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; as one of the worst &quot;Star Trek&quot; games. In the same year, Tom&#x27;s Guide ranked &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; as one of the top ten &quot;Star Trek&quot; games. In 2017, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; ranked &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; among the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; games, noting that it includes original voice acting by actors from the live-action television series. In 2020, Screen Rant ranked &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; as the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, saying that &quot;This is Star Trek at its best. The nature of the franchise makes it perfectly suited to being a massively multiplayer online role-playing game&quot;.

<doc id="1179801" wikidata="Q420204" url="?curid=1179801" title="Boracite">
<text>Boracite is a magnesium borate mineral with formula: Mg3B7O13Cl. It occurs as blue green, colorless, gray, yellow to white crystals in the orthorhombic - pyramidal crystal system. Boracite also shows pseudo-isometric cubical and octahedral forms. These are thought to be the result of transition from an unstable high temperature isometric form on cooling. Penetration twins are not unusual. It occurs as well formed crystals and dispersed grains often embedded within gypsum and anhydrite crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 7 to 7.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. Refractive index values are nα = 1.658 - 1.662, nβ = 1.662 - 1.667 and nγ = 1.668 - 1.673. It has a conchoidal fracture and does not show cleavage. It is insoluble in water (not to be confused with borax, which is soluble in water).

Boracite is typically found in evaporite sequences associated with gypsum, anhydrite, halite, sylvite, carnallite, kainite and hilgardite. It was first described in 1789 for specimens from its type locality of Kalkberg hill, Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. It is also found near Sussex, New Brunswick.

The name is derived from its boron content (19 to 20% boron by mass).

<text>Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson (29 December 1881 – 25 March 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Anderson was born on 29 December 1881 to W. J. Anderson CBE, who resided at Strathairly, Largo, Fife. He was married to Gertrude Campbell. He was educated at Fettes College.

Anderson was 36 years old and an acting lieutenant colonel in the British Army, in the 12th (S) Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 25 March 1918 at Bois Favieres, near Maricourt, France. He died as a result of the act for which he was commended.

A novel, &quot;The Way Home&quot;, was published in 2007 about Bertie Anderson and his three brothers, all of whom were also killed in the First World War. It was written by Robin Scott-Elliot, Bertie&#x27;s great-grandson. Anderson&#x27;s VC is on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum.

<doc id="1179821" wikidata="Q3317648" url="?curid=1179821" title="Mobile identification number">
<text>The mobile identification number (MIN) or mobile subscription identification number (MSIN) refers to the 10-digit unique number that a wireless carrier uses to identify a mobile phone, which is the last part of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). The MIN is a number that uniquely identifies a mobile phone working under TIA standards for cellular and PCS technologies (e.g. EIA/TIA–553 analog, IS–136 TDMA, IS–95 or IS-2000 CDMA). MIN usage became prevalent for mobile number portability to switch providers. It can also be called the MSID (Mobile Station ID) or IMSI_S (Short IMSI).

== MIN derivation ==
The mobile identification number (MIN) is a number that is derived from the 10-digit directory telephone number assigned to a mobile station. The rules for deriving the MIN from the 10-digit telephone number are given in the IS-95 standard. MIN1 is the first or least significant 24 binary digits of the MIN. MIN2 is the second part of the MIN containing the 10 most significant binary digits. MIN1, and the ESN, along with other digital input, are used during the authentication process. The MIN is used to identify a mobile station.

In the case of analog cellular, the MIN is used to route the call. In most second generation systems, temporary numbers are assigned to the handset when routing calls as a security precaution.

<text>Major John Thompson McKellar Anderson (12 January 1918 – 5 October 1943) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Anderson was educated at Stowe School, where he was in Chatham House along with his close friend Leonard Cheshire, who was also awarded the VC. He subsequently attended Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Second World War==
In 1943, during the Second World War, Anderson was an acting major in the 8th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s), in Tunisia. He had been promoted from &quot;lieutenant (temporary captain)&quot; in which rank he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North Africa&quot;, but that award had not yet been published when the action took place for which he was awarded the VC, on 23 April 1943 at the Battle of Longstop Hill. The citation reads: 

He was killed in action at Termoli, Italy on 5 October 1943. He was buried at the Sangro River War Cemetery in Abruzzo, Italy.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum, Stirling Castle, Scotland.

<doc id="1179832" wikidata="Q6915612" url="?curid=1179832" title="Moseley Railway Trust">
<text>The Moseley Railway Trust is a major British collection of industrial narrow gauge locomotives and other equipment. It originally had its base in south Manchester, but has relocated to the Apedale Community Country Park near Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, where the Apedale Valley Light Railway and an important museum are being established next to the Apedale Heritage Centre.

Phase 1 of the narrow gauge Apedale Valley Light Railway opened to the public in during August 2010. Plans for the large new museum building have been approved by the local council and it was intended that construction will commence during 2011.

It is planned that there will eventually be an industrial demonstration railway line running around the perimeter of the MRT/Apedale Heritage Centre site, connecting with a recreation of an adit called No 7 Drift, from which coal was extracted by the previous occupiers of the site, the Aurora Mining Company, until around 1998.

==Overview==
From summer 1998 to summer 2008, the trust&#x27;s collection was in storage, initially at a site in Whaley Bridge, and later at a site at Buxworth in Derbyshire, having been forced to vacate its site at Cheadle, near Manchester, where it had operated a gauge railway – the Moseley Tramway – using its ex-industrial locomotives. 
Although starting work on site at Apedale on 6 April 2006, the trust formally took possession of the site on 13 April 2006 with partners Apedale Heritage Centre, the trust set about adapting the existing former mines buildings to serve as a base for the collection. A new locomotive storage building was constructed during 2008 to house the collection, although the collection continued to grow, rendering this space inadequate to house the current collection and necessitating provision of further storage in former shipping containers around the site. The main running line for the passenger railway was completed in July 2010 and opened the following month. The Silverdale station building was brought into use in 2011, and now houses a shop for books and souvenirs, as well as providing an information point and tickets sales for the railway.

From 2011, construction was started on the foundations of a new museum building which will allow the trust to display its collection of industrial narrow gauge equipment that has been gathered from various industries around the UK since the trust&#x27;s early days in the late 1960s. From summer 2013, the start of construction of a demonstration railway around the adjoining field, part of the land jointly owned with Apedale Heritage Centre, was commenced and in operation for the 2014 event commemorating the start of the First World War. This 2014 event, called Tracks to the Trenches, also saw the trust construct a short section of a World War 1 trench system which would allow re-enactors to demonstrate the interaction of light railways with the requirements of the front line.

Work continues behind the scenes to provide a railway extension across the Apedale Road and further into the Apedale Valley. As of 2018, this has made good progress following discussions with other interested groups, but is currently held up by legal aspects of some rights of ways which need to be addressed before construction can commence.

==History of the Trust==
Originally an after school club at the Moseley Hall Grammar school, and believed to have started around 1967 under the leadership of teacher Colin Saxton, the club, known as the Moseley Tramway, initially operated a horse-drawn line on special occasions. The original material came from a local brickwork&#x27;s, and when the school transferred to a new modern site at Cheadle Road, Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, around 1970, the railway was moved too.

At the new site, the original gauge of was changed to be and the collection expanded to include some internal combustion locomotives, again sourced from local industry. During the 1970s, the UK&#x27;s grammar school system was abandoned, and the school became a comprehensive school under the new system, but the railway survived and flourished. By the 1990s, there was around half a mile of track and around 15 locomotives. It was during this period that the changing population profile caused the school to be closed and converted into a tertiary college – the Ridge-Danyers Tertiary College. By this time, the railway group was an independent club, and following some disagreements over the running of the club, former teacher Colin Saxton removed his equipment, ultimately setting it up near Redruth, Cornwall under the name Moseley Tramway once more. Meanwhile, the club were offered a lease by the college, which they took, however this was a ploy by the college to have the railway removed from the site, since by converting &quot;sitting tenants&quot; to lessees, there was a termination clause included in the lease. The eviction notice arrived during late 1996, and gave until summer 1998 to remove everything. Thus began an odyssey: a search for a new site. In parallel with this, the former Moseley Tramway committee started to look at what the trust should become in the future. Particularity, as an unincorporated club, the group was unable to sign leases etc., and so one of the first tasks was to form a company – the Moseley Industrial Narrow Gauge Railway Museum Trust Ltd, which was a typical name produced by committee as fully representing the aims of the group. This long-winded name was incorporated on 12 April 1998, but shortened to be Moseley Railway Trust (MRT), initially for convenience, and eventually becoming the legal name in May 2009.

During the seven years between the formal notice being served and the identification of a new home – Apedale – a total of 300 possible sites were located, examined, discussed, and then discarded. Meanwhile, with the July 1998 deadline approaching, attention moved to finding a storage location, and a former mill in Whaley Bridge, the Meverill Springs Works, off New Lane, was identified as being suitable for the storage needs, and the collection was moved there that summer.

In Summer 2000, an open day was held to allow the collection to be viewed by enthusiasts, which proved quite popular. But unfortunately, having been resident for about 3 years, the site was sold for a housing development and the newly formed Moseley Railway trust was forced to hunt for another storage site. The next one was found about a mile away at Buxworth, once more in an old mill, although this site was less than ideal, being situated on a relatively steeply graded site.

Searches for a permanent site continued during this period in storage, and in late 2002 a letter about some land in Sandbach, Cheshire arrived at the Foden lorry works in Sandbach was sent. This found its way to the Apedale Heritage Centre at Chesterton near Newcastle-under-Lyme, who were looking to partner a railway attraction at their site off Loomer Road. A site visit and meeting were arranged and an agreement was made – the search was finally over.

It was however to be another three years before the site was ready for occupation. An interview with Peter Morris of Staffordshire County Council (SCC) in February 2003 was arranged, with the result that SCC agreed to work with MRT to develop a mile-long railway which passed over Apedale Road and into the adjacent Apedale Country Park. Initially the 8.5-acre site adjacent to the Apedale Heritage Centre was to be bought by the local council, but difficulties were encountered, leading to a decision for MRT and AHC to jointly purchase the land. which was completed on 13 April 2006.

==Site development==
Early access to the site before the sale completion was granted by the seller, and work to convert the corrugated iron shed (known as the Red Shed) which had formerly housed the coal bagging plant commenced on Friday 6 April. There was some urgency for this work since the Cadeby railway group had been asked to relocate before the end of May 2006 – a task which was accomplished on time.

A period of adapting the former mine buildings took place from April 2006, and planning permission was applied for to both construct the mile-long railway, convert the buildings to a new use, and to construct a locomotive storage building (the Aurora North building) which would be 140 ft long and 25 ft wide (42.6m x 7.6m). The permission also included outline consent for a water tower in the Silverdale Station area, as well as a museum of 29m x 12m (120 feet x 40 feet) adjacent to the running line and situated to the north of the Silverdale Station building. An application to modify the route of a footpath which crossed the site was also applied for, although the process ultimately took four years to complete.

By early 2007, the existing former mines buildings were functional, with running water and power in place, and the workshop building had undergone some conversion work to adapt it to its new use, and thoughts turned to construction of the railway. Groundwork was carried out in front of the Silverdale station (still a floor slab only at this stage) and a section of ballast, suitable for a double track loop, was prepared for about 150m. In early March, the first section of track was laid – the release points and headshunt at the Heritage Centre end of the railway. Over the following weeks, this was extended to the Red Shed, where a connection was finally made, and the first loco was able to run from the Red Shed up to the Heritage Centre.

The main line was continued down past the Red Shed and into the yard area north of the Red Shed, and during 2008, contractors laid the foundations for the Aurora North building, and this work was complete by June 2008. With its completion, the way forward was clear to finally vacate the storage site at Buxworth – something which was costing the trust £500 per month to use. By August 2008, Buxworth was vacated, and all locomotives within the collection were now at Apedale, allowing a first Gala to be held, albeit without the possibility of passenger rides.

Construction work continued, (leaving a gap in the line alongside Aurora North to allow for the footpath, as yet undiverted) with the loop at Apedale Road station being completed, as well as fencing alongside the whole of the line on the Country Park side. By July 2010, the footpath diversion had been finalised, and the running line completed and tested by the start of August. Thus on 14 August 2010, the heads of department agreed that passenger services could start running the following week. Such was the enthusiasm, that chatting with some interested onlookers walking on the new footpath alongside the railway, the first train was run that day at about 4pm. Services officially commenced on 21 August 2010, using a temporary platform to the north of the Silverdale Station pending the station&#x27;s completion. 

The line was fully completed following finalising of the footpath diversion, and the first passenger train with paying passengers ran in the late afternoon of 14 August 2010. The official opening and first official passenger trains started on 21 August 2010, following which a regular service ran each Saturday until the end of October. Santa trains ran for the first time that December, and the railway has since operated each season from 2011 onward between the start of April and the end of October.

For the 2014 &#x27;Tracks to the Trenches&#x27; commemorative event, a field railway was laid around the perimeter of the event field, and included a steeply graded branch to serve the replica WW1 trench. This was to allow cameo&#x27;s to be set up to permit re-enactors to demonstrate the process of using the trench, delivering stores and equipment by rail, and evacuating wounded. Over the following years, the field railway was further extended to provide additional wagon storage, and the long-term intention is to complete a loop to join up with the trench railway branch. Two further major &#x27;Tracks to the Trenches&#x27; events were held, in 2016 and 2018, and all three events won critical acclaim for their diversity and presentation of equipment and material from WW1, with a significant number of WW1 re-enactors attending each event.

In 2020, despite the limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, two further major projects were carried out. Recognising that additional under-cover secure locomotive storage was needed, a second locomotive storage shed was erected near the WW1 Trench exhibit. This new building, called Aurora South, has four tracks, with two entering from each end - a configuration imposed by restrictions in where the building could be constructed due to the existence of a mining adit slightly to the south of the building. A grant for 25% of the funding was provided by the Newcastle-under-Lyme Civic Society, with the remainder of the funding raised by the Trust. The two tracks in the north entrance to the building are multi-gauge, allowing 2ft gauge (610mm), 2ft-6in gauge (762mm) and 3ft gauge (914mm)locomotives to enter the building - the Trust owns locomotives of each of these gauges. Construction of the building started in November 2020, and was completed in January 2021. A local steel building contractor was used for the erection. Work continues to connect the north end tracks to the rest of the infrastructure, but the south end was connected up in early 2021.

The second major project for 2020 was erection of a steam locomotive watering facility at the Silverdale Station at the south end of the passenger line, and was fully funded by a grant from the Newcastle-under-Lyme Civic Society. Construction started in early 2020, with the installation of a reinforced concrete base, followed in November by construction of the brick tower to support a 4000 litre (880 UK gallons) water tank of traditional railway appearance. The water tank was constructed by a local fabricator to a design produced by the Trust, and was completed in August 2020. It was installed on the brickwork tower during August 2021. The water crane, also included with the grant funding, has been designed and should be erected over the winter of 2022-23.

==Railway Museum==

The piled foundations for the new museum building – the Narrow Gauge Railway Centre – were laid during 2011, but are awaiting funding to move the project forward. The building is 120 ft long and 39 ft wide (36.5m long x 12m wide) is modelled on an LNWR good shed, with the prototype inspiration coming from the former goods shed building to the south of Stafford Station on the east side of the railway. Eventually, the building will form the carriage shed when the railway is closed, and house a display to interpret narrow gauge railways and their purposes through photographic displays and restored vehicles within the collection. When completed, the building will also include a toilet facility to help cope with visitor numbers on event days.

==Railway extension==

MRT&#x27;s intention is to build the railway in several stages. The first stage, from Silverdale Station to Apedale Road, was completed during 2010 and opened to passenger services on 21 August 2010. The station platform at Apedale Road was completed the following year.

The second stage of construction will be from Apedale Road through to a site adjacent to the former Burley Colliery site, and will be known as Burley Shales Station. This will involve a level crossing across Apedale Road, followed by construction of the new line in its own fenced right of way for approximately , giving a total line length of about . It is expected that once the legal processes are complete, the line construction will take around 18 months.

The third stage of the line&#x27;s extension will be from Burley Shales site to a site adjacent to the Miry Pools area, located in the former Miry Quarry, and will add another or railway, bringing the total line distance to just over .

==Steam locomotives==

The trust&#x27;s steam locomotives include:
* Kerr Stuart, &quot;Tattoo&quot; class Stanhope (works number 2395 of 1917); boiler ticket expired in 2018. Back in service May 2021.
* Kerr Stuart, &quot;Joffre&quot; type (works number 3014 of 1916) from WW1 trench railways in France; restored in 2011 and used to haul passenger trains. Boiler ticket expired in September 2020 and is awaiting overhaul. Another &quot;Joffre&quot; type locomotives can be found based at the West Lancashire Light Railway where it is named &quot;Joffre&quot;.
* Hudswell Clarke, (works number 1238 of 1916) repatriated from Ghana during 2008; restoration commenced in February 2010 and was completed in September 2014 in time for the Tracks to the Trenches event.
* Hunslet, &quot;War Office&quot; class (works number 1215 of 1916), WWI trench locomotive repatriated from Australia; has been away from Apedale during a complete stripdown for restoration to steam, which was completed in July 2018, and making its first public appearance at the Tracks to the Trenches Commemoration event held on 13–15 July 2018.
*Replica Decauville Type 1 named Edgar. Constructed 2018 by North Bay Railway Engineering Services. Only recently started operating at the railway and as yet is not passed for hauling passenger trains (September 2022).
*Avonside Engine Company (works number 1986 of 1928). Repatriated from South Africa in 2020 by Jeremy Martin for his private Richmond Light Railway, Kent, but was subsequently purchased by a Moseley Railway trust member and arrived at the railway in June 2021. Long term restoration project which will require a new boiler and new frames.
*Bagnall 0-4-0ST (works number 2133 of 1924) named Woto. Moved to the railway in 2024. 

The Trust&#x27;s collection also includes around 90 petrol, battery and diesel-powered narrow gauge locomotives stored at the site, many of them in the Aurora North and the Aurora South Storage buildings. There are also three IC locomotives on display in the Apedale Heritage Centre Museum (open weekends between 10am and 4pm), and some others stored outside.

<doc id="1179836" wikidata="Q423010" url="?curid=1179836" title="Enstatite">
<text>Enstatite is a mineral; the magnesium endmember of the pyroxene silicate mineral series enstatite (MgSiO3) – ferrosilite (FeSiO3). The magnesium rich members of the solid solution series are common rock-forming minerals found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The intermediate composition, , has historically been known as hypersthene, although this name has been formally abandoned and replaced by orthopyroxene. When determined petrographically or chemically the composition is given as relative proportions of enstatite (En) and ferrosilite (Fs) (e.g., En80Fs20).

==Polymorphs and varieties==

Most natural crystals are orthorhombic (space group P&quot;bca&quot;) although three polymorphs are known. The high temperature, low pressure polymorphs are protoenstatite and protoferrosilite (also orthorhombic, space group P&quot;bcn&quot;) while the low temperature forms, clinoenstatite and clinoferrosilite, are monoclinic (space group P2&quot;1/c&quot;).

Weathered enstatite with a small amount of iron takes on a submetallic luster and a bronze-like color. This material is termed bronzite, although it is more correctly called altered enstatite.

Bronzite and hypersthene were known long before enstatite, which was first described by G. A. Kenngott in 1855.
An emerald-green variety of enstatite is called chrome-enstatite and is cut as a gemstone. The green color is caused by traces of chromium, hence the varietal name. In addition, black, chatoyant hypersthene and brownish bronzite are also used as semi-precious gemstones.

==Identification==
Enstatite and the other orthorhombic pyroxenes are distinguished from those of the monoclinic series by their optical characteristics, such as straight extinction, much weaker double refraction and stronger pleochroism. They also have a prismatic cleavage that is perfect in two directions at 90 degrees. Enstatite is white, gray, greenish, or brown in color; its hardness is 5–6 on the Mohs scale, and its specific gravity is 3.2–3.3. This prismatic form is used in gemstones, and for academic purposes.

==Occurrence==
Isolated crystals are rare, but orthopyroxene is an essential constituent of various types of igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. Magnesian orthopyroxene occurs in plutonic rocks such as gabbro (norite) and diorite. It may form small idiomorphic phenocrysts and also groundmass grains in volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, and dacite.

Enstatite, close to En90Fs10 in composition, is an essential mineral in typical peridotite and pyroxenite of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Xenoliths of peridotite are common in kimberlite and in some basalt. Measurements of the calcium, aluminum, and chromium contents of enstatite in these xenoliths have been crucial in reconstructing the depths from which the xenoliths were plucked by the ascending magmas.

Orthopyroxene is an important constituent of some metamorphic rocks such as granulite. Orthopyroxene near pure enstatite in composition occurs in some metamorphosed serpentines. Large crystals, a foot in length and mostly altered to steatite, were found in 1874 in the apatite veins traversing mica-schist and hornblende-schist at the apatite mine of Kjørstad, near Brevik in southern Norway.

Enstatite is a common mineral in meteorites. Crystals have been found in stony and iron meteorites, including one that fell at Breitenbach in the Ore Mountains, Bohemia. In some meteorites, together with olivine it forms the bulk of the material; it can occur in small spherical masses, or chondrules, with an internal radiated structure.

==In space==
Enstatite is one of the few silicate minerals that have been observed in crystalline form outside the Solar System, particularly around evolved stars and planetary nebulae such as NGC 6302. Enstatite is thought to be one of the early stages for the formation of crystalline silicates in space. Many correlations have been noted between the occurrence of the mineral and the structure of the object around which it has been observed.

Enstatite is thought to be a main component of the E-type asteroids. The Hungaria asteroids are the main examples in the Solar System.

A layer of quartz and enstatite clouds above an iron cloud deck are thought to exist in the atmosphere of the young brown dwarf 2M2224-0158.

<text>The Astley Green Colliery Museum is a museum run by the Red Rose Steam Society in Astley near Tyldesley in Greater Manchester, England. () Before becoming a museum, the site was a working colliery that produced coal from 1912 to 1970; it is now protected as a Scheduled Monument. The museum occupies a site by the Bridgewater Canal which has the only surviving pit headgear and engine house on the Lancashire Coalfield.

==History==
Astley Green Colliery exploited deep coal seams of the Manchester Coalfield underneath the peat bog known as Chat Moss, and was driven by the high demand for coal during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the exhaustion of supplies of coal in the Irwell Valley. Shaft sinking began in 1908 by the Pilkington Colliery Company, a subsidiary of the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company, and the pit began production in 1912. In 1928 the colliery was amalgamated with other local collieries to form Manchester Collieries. The mine was modernised when the coal industry was nationalised in 1947. Astley Green Colliery was closed in 1970 and was subsequently opened to the public as a museum.

==Museum==

Astley Green Colliery has the only surviving headgear and engine house on what was the Lancashire coalfield. The headgear is made from wrought iron lattice girders with rivetted plates at the joints. It has two large and one small wheel mounted at the top. It is nearly high and was built by Head Wrightson of Stockton-on-Tees and completed by 1912. 
In the winding house there is a twin tandem compound steam engine made by Yates and Thom of Blackburn who supplied 16 Lancashire boilers. Its engine house has the largest steam winding engine used on the coalfield. The 3,300 horse power twin tandem compound engine was built by Yates &amp; Thom in Blackburn.

The museum also has a collection of 28 colliery locomotives, the largest such collection in the UK.

==Railway==

As of Summer 2019, a roughly 200m section of track has been restored and built by volunteers. One locomotive is currently operational with another due to under essential maintenance, before passenger services can start on the railway.

<doc id="1179857" wikidata="Q849995" url="?curid=1179857" title="Bronzite">
<text>Bronzite is a member of the pyroxene group of minerals, belonging with enstatite and hypersthene to the orthorhombic series of the group. Rather than a distinct species, it is really a ferriferous variety of enstatite, which owing to partial alteration has acquired a bronze-like sub-metallic luster on the cleavage surfaces.

Enstatite is magnesium silicate, , with the magnesium partly replaced by small amounts (up to about 12%) of Fe+2. In the bronzite variety, , the iron(II) oxide ranges from about 12 to 30%, and with still more iron there is a passage to hypersthene. The ferriferous varieties are liable to a particular kind of alteration, known as schillerization, which results in the separation of the iron as very fine films of oxide and hydroxides along the cleavage cracks of the mineral. The cleavage surfaces therefore exhibit a metallic sheen or schiller, which is even more pronounced in hypersthene than in bronzite. The color of bronzite is green or brown; its specific gravity is about 3.3–3.4, varying with the amount of iron present. The refractive indices and optic angle increase with iron content. The enstatite endmember has a positive optic sign, whereas bronzite and hypersthene both show a negative optic sign.

Like enstatite, bronzite is a constituent of many mafic to ultramafic igneous rocks, such as, norite, gabbro, and especially peridotite, and of the serpentinites which have been derived from them. It also occurs in some crystalline schist. Bronzitite, a pyroxenite of bronzite composition, is noted in the cumulate rocks of the Stillwater igneous complex of Montana.

==Ornamental usage==
Bronzite is sometimes cut and polished, usually in convex forms, for small ornamental objects, but its use for this purpose is less extensive than that of hypersthene. It often has a more-or-less distinct fibrous structure, and when this is pronounced the sheen has a certain resemblance to that of cats-eye. Masses sufficiently large for cutting are found in the norite of the Kupferberg in the Fichtel Mountains, and in the serpentine of Kraubat near Leoben in Styria. In this connection mention may be made of an altered form of enstatite or bronzite known as &quot;bastite&quot; or &quot;schiller spar&quot;. Here, in addition to schillerization, the original enstatite has been altered by hydration and the product has the approximate composition of serpentine. In color bastite is brown or green with the same metallic sheen as bronzite. The typical locality is Baste in the Radauthal, Harz, where patches of pale greyish-green bastite are embedded in a darker-colored serpentine. This rock when cut and polished makes an effective decorative stone, although little used for that purpose.

<text>The 33rd Infantry Division () was a German Army infantry division active in World War II. It served in the battle of France and subsequently was converted into the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]].

==History==
The 33rd Infantry Division was formed in 1936, as part of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;&#x27;s expansion to 36 divisions. It was mobilized in 1939, but remained on the defensive in the west and did not take part in the invasion of Poland.

In May 1940 the division was attached to Panzer Group Kleist, and followed in reserve behind the advance into the Low Countries, through Luxembourg and Bastogne. Marching into France, it reached the battle front near St Quentin, and took up defensive positions along the Somme at Peronne It built a bridgehead across the river, which was used by the armored divisions of XVI motorised Army Corps in the relaunch of the German offensive on 6 June 1940. Attacking alongside the panzers the division broke through the Weygand line, and advanced to the south.

When the XVI Panzer Corps was withdrawn on 8 June for reassignment, the 33rd Infantry Division took over the 3rd Panzer Division sector, and continued the advance towards Paris. The division then accelerated its pace, crossing first the Marne, followed by the Seine and the Loire, finally reaching the Cher at Montrichard

Following the French surrender, it spent two months with the occupation forces until it was returned to Germany and in November 1940 was dissolved. The bulk of the division was reorganized as the 15th Panzer Division by incorporating the 8th Panzer Regiment from the 10th Panzer Division. Its surplus 110th Infantry Regiment went to the 112th Infantry Division and its horse drawn elements were incorporated into the newly forming 129th Infantry Division.

==Commanders==
* General der Infanterie Eugen Ritter von Schobert (1 April 1936 - 4 February 1938)
* Generalleutnant Hermann Ritter von Speck (1 March 1938 – 29 April 1940)
* Generalleutnant Rudolf Sintzenich (29 April 1940 – 5 October 1940)
* Generalmajor Friedrich Kühn (5 October 1940 - 11 November 1940)

<doc id="1179865" wikidata="Q280488" url="?curid=1179865" title="Sikorsky Ilya Muromets">
<text>The Sikorsky &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; () (versions S-22, S-23, S-24, S-25, S-26 and S-27) was a class of Russian pre-World War I large four-engine commercial airliners and military heavy bombers used during World War I by the Russian Empire. The aircraft series was named after Ilya Muromets, a hero from Slavic mythology. The series was based on the Russky Vityaz or Le Grand, the world&#x27;s first four-engined aircraft, designed by Igor Sikorsky. The Ilya Muromets aircraft as it appeared in 1913 was a revolutionary design, intended for commercial service with its spacious fuselage incorporating a passenger saloon and washroom on board. The Ilya Muromets was the world&#x27;s first multi-engine aircraft in production and at least sixty were built. During World War I, it became the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit. This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no aircraft capable enough to rival it until much later.

== Design and development ==
The Ilya Muromets (Sikorsky S-22) was designed and constructed by Igor Sikorsky at the Russo-Baltic Carriage Factory (RBVZ) in Saint Petersburg in 1913. It was based on his earlier S-21 &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot;, which started out as the twin-engined &quot;Le Grand&quot;, then as the twin tandem-engined &quot;Bolshoi Baltisky&quot; before placing all four of the &quot;Baltisky&#x27;s&quot; engines in a tractor configuration along the lower wing&#x27;s leading edge to create the Russky Vityaz — which had played an important role in the development of Russian aviation and the multi-engine aircraft industries of the world.

The Ilya Muromets was first conceived and built as a luxurious aircraft. It was the first aircraft to have an insulated passenger saloon, containing wicker chairs, a bedroom, a lounge, as well as the first airborne toilet. The aircraft also had heating and electrical lighting. The S-22 cockpit had sufficient space allowing several persons to observe the pilot. Openings on both sides of the fuselage permitted mechanics to climb out onto the lower wings to service the engines during flight. A hatch on the left side provided an entry to the main cabin, behind the cockpit. The main cabin featured two large windows on each side. Further back was a private cabin that included a berth, a small table, and a cabinet. Lighting was provided by a wind-driven generator and heating was supplied by two long engine exhaust pipes that passed through the corners of the cabin. Despite many advancements, the flight instruments on the Ilya Muromets were primitive. They included four tachometers, one per engine, a compass, a crude altimeter and airspeed indicator, two glass U-shaped tubes and a ball for bank indication, and a series of horizontal bars situated vertically on the nose of the fuselage for measuring climbs and descents. Later, in the bomber variants, a drift indicator and elementary bombsight were added to aid bombing.

In 1913 the Ilya Muromets No. 107 flew for the first time, and on 11 February 1914, the second prototype (factory airframe 128) took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard, marking a record for number of passengers carried. From 30 June to 12 July 1914, it set a world record by making a trip from Saint Petersburg to Kiev, a distance of some 1200 km, and back. The first leg took 14 hours and 38 minutes, with one landing for fuel at Orsha, and the return one, with a fuel stop at Novosokolniki, took even less time, about 13 hours. According to Sikorsky, &quot;The flight proved conclusively the value of large multi-motored airplanes. The Army placed an order for ten four-engined airplanes of the &quot;Ilia Mourometz&quot; type and the factory personnel was overjoyed by this final approval of the results of two years of hard work.&quot; The acclaim received by Sikorsky included Tsar Nicholas II presenting him with the Order of St. Vladimir, Fourth Degree, arranging for an exemption from the wartime draft to allow him to continue his design work, and a promise of a grant worth 100,000 rubles from the State Duma. During an Imperial military review at Krasnoye Selo in July, Nicholas II decorated and christened the Ilya Muromets Type B Military Prototype, No. 128, the &quot;Kievsky.&quot;

During testing, the Ilya Muromets were fitted with both skis and pontoons in anticipation of new variants being produced. If it had not been for World War I, the Ilya Muromets would probably have started passenger flights that same year.

With the beginning of World War I, Sikorsky was encouraged by the results of the proving flights to redesign the aircraft to become the &quot;Military Ilia Mourometz, Type V, the world&#x27;s first purpose-designed heavier than air bomber. The new heavy bomber was slightly smaller and lighter than the Type A. Internal racks carried up to 800 kg of bombs, and positions for up to nine machine guns were added for self-defense in various locations, including the extreme tail. The Muromets (in its S-25 Geh-2 variant, March 1916) was the first aircraft in history to incorporate a tail gunner position. The engines were protected with 5 mm-thick armor. The military version was designed expressly for long-range flying in both bombing and reconnaissance roles.

== Operational history ==
When WWI broke out, only two Ilya Muromets bombers were completed out of an initial production run of ten aircraft. In August 1914, the Ilya Muromets was introduced to the Imperial Russian Air Service and on 10 December 1914, the Russians formed their first ten-bomber squadron, slowly increasing the number to 20 by mid-1916. Operations with the heavy bombers began on 12 February 1915 with a raid on German frontline positions.

German Fighter Pilots often were reluctant to attack Ilya Muromets in the air due to their defensive firepower including the unique tail gun position, and the difficulty in bringing down such a large aircraft. Once engaged, small fighters also found that they were buffeted by propeller wash of the four large engines.

On 12 September 1916 (Julian calendar), the Russians lost their first Ilya Muromets in a fight with four German Albatros, three of which it managed to shoot down. This was also the only loss to enemy action during the war; three others were damaged in combat, but managed to return to base to be repaired.

83 Ilya Muromets bombers were built for the Russian forces between 1913 and 1918. They recorded a number of firsts in the history of military aviation, like bombing from heavy bombers, performing bomber group raids on enemy targets, night bombing, and photographic bomb damage assessment. They were also the first to develop defensive tactics for a single bomber engaged in an air combat with several enemy fighters.

The Ilya Muromets performed more than 400 sorties and dropped 65 tons of bombs during the war. By 1917, attrition from constant flying had reduced the bombing fleet substantially and only four bombers remained at the front line; the other Ilya Muromets were relegated to trainer duties. The heavy bombers of other participants appeared in 1916, all resembling the Russian pioneer to a certain degree. The Russian government and Sikorsky himself sold the design and production license to the British and French governments. The Germans tried to copy its design, using the fragments of the Ilya Muromets they had shot down over their territory in September 1916. By the end of 1916, the design was generally believed to be at the end of its development cycle, with ensuing modifications to individual aircraft, such as additional armor and weapons, making the aircraft too heavy and not suitable for operational use. Continual changes in the field as well as the factory led to many aircraft being redesignated as a new variant.

=== Russian Revolution and aftermath ===
After the armistice between Russia and the Central Powers an Ilya Muromets S-26 D-1 was taken by Polish forces in the city of Babruysk. In October of 1917, Ukrainian forces acquired 16 Ilya Muromets aircraft near the city of Vinnytsia however only six of these were serviceable. During summer of 1918 the Ukrainian State counted four Ilya Murmomets aircraft in its inventory. A few remaining aircraft were used by the newly formed Soviet Air Forces during the Russian Civil War as trainers and transports. Some sources claim that Ilya Muromets aircraft were also used by the White Army during the conflict.

<text>Millennium Bureau of Canada was a small, temporary agency of the Government of Canada, to celebrate the &quot;millennium&quot; during the year 2000. Its theme was &quot;Sharing the Memory, Shaping the Dream&quot;.

The Weather Network and MétéoMédia served as partners with the agency, as the official promoters of related activities across Canada.

== Launch ==

The program was launched by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, on March 12, 1998. The federal government intentionally avoided running its own projects, in favour of assisting grassroots projects with funding. The intent was also that projects would be spread out between 1998 and 2000, as opposed to everything on New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day.

Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray noted that multiple large polls showed public support for millennium celebrations. (Gray oversaw the program, with diplomat Lawrence Dickenson as its executive director.

Some projects were announced at the launch, including Trans-Canada Trail funding, a national tour of the RCMP Musical Ride, and &quot;&quot; mini-series on CBC.

Details of the Millennium Partnership Project was announced in June, the actual funding program.

== Reaction ==

Canadian Taxpayers Federation criticized any spending on the millennium. &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot; noted a debt issue for the federal government, in its editorial, suggesting the government reconsider the millennium funding. &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot; similarly noted that the deficit was &quot;now defeated,&quot; suggesting that people didn&#x27;t &quot;need a nickel&quot; to reflect.

== Projects ==

The 665 projects carried out by the Millennium Bureau include:
* &quot;Passionate vision: Discovering Canada&#x27;s national parks&quot; ($700,000), a book featuring the photography of Canadian astronaut Roberta Bondar
* &quot;The Gun Sculpture&quot; ($250,000), an artwork by Wallis Kendal and Sandra Bromley, of decommissioned guns
* Trans Canada Trail Relay 2000, which received $5 million for a project which included over 800 participating communities and &quot;tens of thousands of volunteer leaders&quot;

Alberta
* Calgary Town Hall Millennium Project ($116,700) towards rebuilding Calgary&#x27;s original town hall at Heritage Park Historical Village
* Dinosaur 2000 Project ($250,000), what would become known as World&#x27;s Largest Dinosaur in Drumheller

Ontario
* International Children&#x27;s Games Millennium Festival, which received $300,000 for a Hamiton-based event
* Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, transferring an unknown soldier from Vimy, France in 2000 to the National War Memorial
* Tall Ships in Halifax, Nova Scotia
* Relay 2000 of the Trans Canada Trail in Hull, Quebec on September 9, 2000
* Literacy Builders
* Canada Remembers 2000
* Pacific Grace Replica Schooner
* Meewasin Valley Trail System
* Canada Dance Festival
* Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic Millennium Exhibit
* The Islendingur: A Timeless Adventure in L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland

The CMPP received more than 10,000 applications representing more than $1.9 billion in financial assistance for millennium projects. Since it was launched in 1998, the CMPP approved 1,745 projects representing just over $149 million in funding.

<text>Oxygène 7–13 (known as &quot;Oxygène 2&quot; on the Oxygène Trilogy box set) is the twelfth studio album by French electronic musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre, released by Disques Dreyfus on 17 February 1997. It is the sequel to his 1976 album &quot;Oxygène&quot; released two decades before and used the same synthesizers. The album is dedicated to Jarre&#x27;s former mentor, experimental musician Pierre Schaeffer. The album cover art was created by long-time collaborator Michel Granger.
The CD cover used lenticular printing to make the illusion of moving stars in the background.

== Background ==
&quot;Oxygène 7-13&quot; is dedicated to his mentor at the GRM, Pierre Schaeffer, who had died two years before. The album was recorded and mixed by Jarre together with Patrick Pelamourges and René Ameline respectively at Oxygene studio and Croissy studio. It was also the last album by Jarre featuring Michel Geiss as collaborator. It also had the collaboration of keyboardist Francis Rimbert and programmer Christian Sales. He combined the &quot;spherical sounds&quot; of the 1976 album with contemporary rhythms. Eschewing digital techniques developed in the 1980s, in an interview for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; he said:

== Release ==
&quot;Oxygène 7-13&quot; was released in February 1997. &quot;Oxygène 7&quot;, &quot;Oxygène 8&quot; and &quot;Oxygène 10&quot; were released as singles. A number of remixes of &quot;Oxygène 7–13&quot; tracks were made, including those comprising most of the album &quot;Odyssey Through O2&quot;. The Orb&#x27;s &quot;Toxygene&quot; was originally going to be a remix of &quot;Oxygène 8&quot;. However, The Orb &quot;obliterated it&quot; and reassembled only a few fragments for their new song. The album was followed by a promotional indoor European tour, and a concert in Moscow, Russia in which he would break for the fourth and last time his record for the largest audience in an open-air concert with a total of 3.5 million.

<text>Maximilian Shulman (March 14, 1919 – August 28, 1988) was an American writer and humorist best known for his television and short story character Dobie Gillis, as well as for best-selling novels.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Shulman was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and raised in the city&#x27;s Selby-Dale neighborhood. His father Abraham, a house painter, and his mother Bessie Karchmar were Jewish immigrants from Belarus.

As a student at the University of Minnesota, where he was classmate of Thomas Heggen, Thomas R. St. George and Norman Katkov, Shulman wrote a column for the Minnesota Daily as well as pieces for &quot;Ski-U-Mah&quot;, the college humor magazine. His writing humorously exaggerated campus culture. Shortly after Shulman graduated in 1942, an agent from Doubleday persuaded Shulman to send him some clips, which resulted in the campus satire &quot;Barefoot Boy with Cheek&quot;, a surprise 1943 bestseller. In 1947 Shulman adapted &quot;Barefoot Boy&quot; into a musical of the same name.

===Later career===
Shulman&#x27;s works include the novels &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys!&quot;, which was made into a film starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Joan Collins; &quot;The Feather Merchants&quot;; &quot;The Zebra Derby&quot;; &quot;Sleep till Noon&quot;; and &quot;Potatoes Are Cheaper&quot;.

In 1954 he co-wrote (with Robert Paul Smith) the Broadway play &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; starring Robert Preston but it wasn&#x27;t a success; the work was later adapted into a movie starring Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. He wrote the libretto for the 1968 musical &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot;, which was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical.

Shulman&#x27;s collegiate character Dobie Gillis was the subject of a series of short stories compiled under the title &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, which became the basis for the 1953 movie &quot;The Affairs of Dobie Gillis&quot;, followed by a CBS television series, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1959–1963). Shulman was a script writer for the series and also wrote the lyrics for the series&#x27; theme song (music was composed by Lionel Newman). The same year the series began, Shulman published another Dobie Gillis story collection, &quot;I Was a Teenage Dwarf&quot; (1959). After his initial success with Dobie Gillis in the early 1950s, Shulman syndicated a humor column, &quot;On Campus&quot;, to over 350 collegiate newspapers at one point.. He piloted another series for CBS for the 1961 season &quot;Daddy-O&quot;, which showed behind-the-scenes of TV sitcom production. It was turned down by CBS. Mr. Shulman wrote a TV movie for CBS, HELP WANTED: MALE, that got a 47 share of the audience and was the second highest rated mow of the year.

A later novel, &quot;Anyone Got a Match?&quot;, satirized both the television and tobacco industries (which was ironic as his &quot;On Campus&quot; column was sponsored by a cigarette company), as well as the South and college football. His last major project was &quot;House Calls&quot;, which began as a 1978 movie based on one of his stories, and starred Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson; it spun off the 1979–1982 television series of the same name, starring Wayne Rogers and Lynn Redgrave in the leads. Shulman was the head writer.

Shulman was one of the collaborators on a 1954 non-fiction television program &quot;Light&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee&quot;, timed to the 75th anniversary of the invention of the light bulb.

===Family===
Shulman married twice: he had four children from his first marriage with Carol S. Rees (21 December 1941 - 17 May 1963, her death) and one child from his second marriage with Mary Gordon Bryant (14 June 1964 - 28 August 1988, his death).

His daughter, Martha Rose Shulman, is a cookbook author.

Max Shulman died August 28, 1988, of bone cancer at the age of 69 in Los Angeles, California.

<text>In Irish mythology, Cana Cludhmor was a woman who played a vital role in the mythical invention of the harp. Cana Cludhmor fled to the seashore from her husband Machuel, and heard beautiful music on the wind and was soon lulled into a deep sleep. On finding her, Machuel realised the wind had created the music by blowing through partially rotted sinew still attached to a nearby whale skeleton. He designed the harp based on this.

Her name was misprinted as Canola in some references.

<doc id="1179888" wikidata="Q7552352" url="?curid=1179888" title="Society of American Archivists">
<text>The Society of American Archivists is the oldest and largest archivist association in North America, serving the educational and informational needs of more than 5,000 individual archivist and institutional members. Established in 1936, the organization serves upwards of 6,200 individual and member institutions.

The society supports its members and the archival profession through strong publication and professional workshop programs and semi-annual meetings. Currently, workshops are given all across the United States and attend to current archival concerns and issues such as Encoded Archival Description, the digitizing of archival materials, and and conservation of materials, among others. The programs it offers include: Online On-Demand Programs, Online Real Time Programs and Face to Face Programs.

== History ==
The Society of American Archivists was established in 1936 on the heels of the creation of the National Archives. The organization was born in the wake of the dissolution of the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association. The early days of the organization were fraught with difficulty related to membership as well as professional identity. The American Library Association created a commission on archives, which founding president Albert R. Newsome found disrespectful. There was also tension between the public archives tradition championed by Margaret Cross Norton and the historical manuscripts tradition as the governing philosophy. Public archives tradition puts emphasis on records management and administrative aspects of archival work, whereas historical manuscripts focuses more on the preservation and maintenance of important documents for research purposes. The tension and debate between the two fundamental functions of archives would continue into the 1950s, spilling into elements like elections and where to hold annual meetings.

The first issue of the society&#x27;s journal, the &quot;American Archivist&quot;, appeared in 1938. In 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as an honorary member of the SAA due to his commitment to archiving federal, state and local government documents. After World War II, SAA joined with other international archivist societies to create the International Council on Archives and an archives for the United Nations. A number of committees focused on various interests of the society, including Church Records and College and University Archives. These committees helped legitimize the society, which aided them in a 1956 dispute with National Association of State Libraries over the differences between their two professions. This eventually lead to a joint committee between the American Library Associate and SAA to discuss the nuances and differences of the two professions.

By the 1970s, the majority of membership in SAA was made up of college and university archivists. These archivists, as well as the influence of more progressive social justice movements, allowed for the restructuring the organization as a whole, democratizing elections and restructuring committees. There was also a push for better professional resources as well as education standards. Coming out of the 1960s, there was a large movement of activist archivists, with members taking a greater interest in political and social issues. This forced SAA to take stances on different contemporary public issues that affected the profession. Social historians like Howard Zinn and Sam Bass Warner brought their views to the annual SAA meeting 1971, challenging archivists to re-examine policies and assumptions.

In the 1980s, a large portion of the society&#x27;s focus was on outreach. Systematic studies were conduct to assess who archives users were, how they used the archives, and why. The struggle for creating a professional identity continued as standards for education programs, certification, and institutional evaluation became the forefront of discussion. A Task Force on Goals and Priorities, created in 1982, aimed to amend those issues, attempting to unify the organization under one professional umbrella. New challenges also emerged with the widespread use of the Internet and digital technologies. SAA partnered with the Library of Congress in developing Encoded Archival Description in 1993. EAD is an XML Document Type Definition and a standard for encoding archival finding aids, allowing them to be made accessible online. SAA also offers certification for Digital Archives Specialists, which allows for the profession to work within the emerging technological landscape and capture digital records.

In November 2017, SAA released a Strategic plan for 2018–2020, which outlined four major goal areas for the future: advocating for archives and archivists, enhancing professional growth, advancing the field, and meeting members&#x27; needs.

== Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable ==

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, the SAA began to collaborate with the American Association of Museums and the Association for State and Local History to form a Joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities in Museums, Archives, and Historical Agencies. Phil Mason and Elsie Freivogel were appointed but outreach to minority members of the SAA was poor. Many minorities were unaware of the Joint Committee and expressed that there had not been any direct communications from the committee&#x27;s representatives.

The final report of the SAA Task Force on Diversity states:In 1972 SAA adopted the report of its Committee for the 1970s. Included among the Committee recommendations was a positive injunction to the nominating committee to make the Council more representative of and responsible to the diverse interests of the SAA by considering &quot;archival interest, age, sex, geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race in the selection of a slate of candidates.&quot;Also in the report, &quot;no person should be nominated as a candidate for an SAA office who, in her or his job, flagrantly espouses or practices discrimination in regard to race, sex, nationality, or political or religious ideology.&quot; In 1978, the SAA established a joint Committee on Opportunities for Minorities. However, the group languished in part from a lack of funds.

=== 1980s: Task Force ===
The Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable began as a Task Force on Minorities within the SAA. In 1981, archivists Diana Lachateñeré and Paula Williams drafted a resolution for the task force and members of the SAA approved the group. Thomas Battle, who also chaired the SAA&#x27;s Diversity Committee, was appointed the chairman of the Task Force and John Fleckner, Archie Motley, Daniel T. Williams, and Paula Williams were appointed members. Diana Lachateñeré was chosen as the SAA representative for the Joint Committee on Minority Recruitment, replacing Phil Mason.

In the beginning, members noticed that the task force did not have much representation. In an interview with AACR History, Karen Jefferson stated:At the beginning of the minorities task force Native Americans, people of Latin American and Caribbean descent; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender were included under the umbrella of minorities. Although minorities share some broad experiences as minorities, each group has unique concerns specific to their culture and experience.It was not until 1982 that a representative of Hispanic archivists was appointed: Idilio Garicia Pena. In its six years of existence, the task force made several recommendations to the SAA Council. These recommendations eventually became the foundation of the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable, and they still pursue them today. Some of their recommendations were to:
* Develop a roster of minorities working in the profession.
* Establish a membership committee to help in recruitment efforts for the Society.
* Develop a policy statement regarding recruitment of minorities.
* Develop an organizational handbook to increase membership&#x27;s knowledge of the Society&#x27;s structure and functions.
* Provide orientation for new members at the annual meeting.
* Lower introductory dues rates for new members.
* Establish a single-day registration fee for the annual meeting.
* Seek funds to develop programs to address needs of minorities in the profession.
* Financially support SAA&#x27;s own activities that are designed to address issues related to minorities in the profession.
* Establish a scholarship or fellowship to support the development of minorities in the profession.Many of these goals were met and the creation of the task force proved immediately to be a vehicle for broader minority participation in the SAA, especially in leadership.

=== 1980s: Roundtable ===
In 1987, the task force dissembled, restricted in their effectiveness because of a lack of interest and support from the SAA. The task force made the recommendation that a roundtable be created for minorities, which was formed the same year. Nine SAA members helped to found the roundtable: Diana Lachatanere, Wilda Logan, Carol Rudisell, Karen Jefferson, Ervin Jordan, Clifford Muse, Thomas Battle, Jo Ellen El-Bashir, and Brenda Banks. Diana Lachateñeré and Carol Rudisell served as the coordinators. In September 1987, the AACR held their first meeting in New York City at the annual SAA conference. At this meeting, the structure of the roundtable was adopted with two co-chairs, one elected annually with elections every year. Their first year, Carol Rudisell and Donna Wells co-chaired while Diana Lachateñeré was elected as chair of the Manuscript Section, declining to serve as co-chair.

It was not required to be a member of the SAA in order to participate in the roundtable. This allowed for a freer space in which the roundtable could interact with more minorities among the archival profession. But SAA membership would be encouraged and the chairpersons were required to be SAA members in good standing.

There was a lengthy debate on the name of the roundtable, varying from Minorities Roundtable to African American and Third World Archivists Roundtable. In 1994, the name was chosen to be the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.

==== Newsletter and directory ====
In 1987, the roundtable began publishing a newsletter through the SAA, although not without objections from society members on costs. Thomas Battle then proposed that Howard University would completely fund the newsletter and even publish and distribute it for free. These newsletters were available to anyone who was interested in African American archives, manuscripts and collections. In less than a year, Battle returned to the SAA with a high percentage of popularity and interest in the newsletter among not just African Americans but all archivists. This newsletter continued to be funded by Howard University and was later used as a model for other roundtables of the SAA.

Lachateñeré and Rudisell were the first editors and after the first year, Karen Jefferson and Ruth Hill edited the newsletter. Other editors over the years include Kathryn Neal, Cathy Lynn Mundale, and Jo Ellen El-Bashir, who served one of the longest tenures as editor. In 2003, under editor Rose Roberta, the newsletter became available electronically and continues to be published online. Today, the newsletter continues to be the main source of communication for the roundtable members. The newsletter provides information on different members, institutions, the SAA, archives, and the activities and achievements of the roundtable.

In 1991, Carol Rudisell compiled the first membership directory with racial/ethnic heritage listed for the members. In 1996, this was compiled by Karen Jefferson in the &quot;Archivists of Color Directory&quot;. This is not a directory on the entire membership of the roundtable but a directory of the archivists of color involved in the AACR. Each archivist has a brief biography, including their education, experience and the institutions they are affiliated with. In 2012, a directory was listed on the AACR website including only the name, job title and contact information of the archivist.

==== Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award ====
Several members of the roundtable, including Wilda Logan, helped to establish the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award in 1993. This award is given to recognize graduate students of color who are actively working toward becoming professional archivists in the SAA. The award is sponsored by the AACR and funded through the SAA, named after Harold T. Pinkett who was the first African American archivist to serve at the National Archives. The SAA Council acknowledged the contributions of Harold T. Pinkett in this resolution:Whereas, Harold T. Pinkett served with distinction during his long tenure at the National Archives and Records Service; and Whereas Harold T. Pinkett has been a scholar, archival educator, and mentor who has made important contributions to the archives profession; Therefore be it resolved that in recognition of his lifetime achievements and contributions to the archival profession, the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable supports the renaming of the SAA Minority Student Award to the Harold T. Pinkett Minority Student Award.

=== 1990s ===
The Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness (TFOE) was appointed in 1995–1996. One of the main issues of the task force was to address diversity in the SAA as well as in the archival profession. From this came the creation of the Task Force on Diversity, chaired by Brenda Banks with members Anne Difffendal, John Fleckner, Susan Fox, Karen Jefferson, Deborah King (Burns), Joan Krizak, and Kathleen Roe. The task force investigated the SAA to see where they supported or weakened diversity, discussing possible solutions to improve or encourage it in the SAA as well as the archival profession. Their final report recommended that the SAA:
* Develop an organizational position statement that articulates SAA&#x27;s commitment to becoming a more diverse organization
* Incorporate diversity into SAA&#x27;s strategic planning process.
* Reinforce and expand existing activities within SAA that support diversity.
* Identify and establish new initiatives that may assist SAA in its efforts to become a more diverse organization. 
After the Council accepted the report, they approved a statement on diversity that was released on June 13, 1999:The Society of American Archivists is committed to integrating diversity concerns and perspectives into all aspects of the activities and into the fabric of the profession as a whole. SAA is also committed to the goal of a Society membership that reflects the broad diversity of American society. SAA believes that these commitments are essential to the effective pursuit of the archival mission “to ensure the identification, preservation, and use the nation&#x27;s historical record.Five years later, the SAA Council established a Committee on Diversity in response to complaints that they were moving slowly in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Diversity. After much debate, they established a Task Force on Diversity with its first goal to define &#x27;diversity.&#x27; They were also asked to investigate &quot;how and to what extent issues of democracy are being addressed by the Society.&quot; The Task Force on Diversity submitted its last report in February 1999. In 1996, one of the few articles written on diversity in the archives profession was published. Kathryn M. Neal details the importance of diversity in archives:Expanding the numbers of staff members of color and tapping their potential should (and no doubt would) enhance the overall functions of archives and manuscript repositories. New ideas would likely be stimulated in areas that include, but certainly are not limited to, donor relations (for instance, how to approach and document members of growing communities of color most effectively) and reference/access (determining how to improve services as user groups become increasingly diverse, or how to attract a more diverse pool of researchers if society&#x27;s changing demographics are not reflected.

=== Today ===
Many of the original goals of the roundtable exist today. On their website, they have stated their purposes as to &quot;identify and address the concerns of archivists of African, Asian, Latino and Native American descent; promote wider participation of said archivists in the archival profession; and promote the preservation of archival materials that pertain to people of color.&quot;

However, the roundtable still recognizes the need for more to be done for minorities, especially in archives. In a report made after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the AACR stated: &quot;As archivists, we cannot accept invisibility. As a profession, we cannot continue to accept historical erasure and whitewashing through binary historical practices.&quot;

In 2003, the SAA Council created a subcommittee to see the status of the SAA&#x27;s diversity efforts. In May 2003, they reported that some of the recommendations by the Task Force on Diversity had been addressed while others had not, and the actions had not been effectively reported back to SAA members. The council then voted for a Committee on Diversity. In August 2003, the Council approved the committee:The SAA Committee on Diversity works to ensure that the organization&#x27;s services, activities, policies, communications, and products support the goal of a more diverse SAA and professional archival community. It functions as a catalyst for new diversity-related initiatives, developed in coordination with various SAA entities, and as the organization&#x27;s &quot;conscience&quot; in monitoring, evaluating, advocating, and reporting on matters pertaining to the diversity of archival practitioners and documentation.In 2007, Elizabeth W. Adkins gave her presidential address at the SAA annual meeting in Chicago and highlighted the importance of diversity. &quot;SAA has been working to address diversity concerns for more than thirty-five years, sometimes effectively and sometimes not so effectively.&quot; In her speech, she focused on SAA&#x27;s definition of diversity in comparison to others and how they have progressed.

Adkins states that in 1982, only 2.8% of archivists were nonwhite but in 2004, that number jumped to 7%. SAA is only slightly better with about 10% of its members identifying as part of a minority or ethnic group. Adkins compares this with the national population, which is about 25% of nonwhite people, claiming &quot;both SAA and the profession have a very long way to go to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.&quot; But it&#x27;s a start.

Since 2002, Council meetings and discussion have consistently focused on diversity. Some of the approved motions on diversity from these meetings are:
* Diversity has been and will be incorporated into every Council agenda for the foreseeable future.
* The Council, SAA staff, and all SAA units must report on diversity initiatives.
* The president-elect and the Appointments Committee are required to report on the demographics of all committee appointments and on what was done to seek diversity in committee appointments.

At the 2014 Conference, Bergis Jules and Edward Summers conceived the idea of a set of tools to work with Twitter data. This has become the Documenting the Now (DocNow) project within the Shift Collective.

== Women Archivists Section (WArS) ==
The Women Archivists Roundtable (WAR) monitors the status of women archivists and promotes the participation of women in the archives profession, specifically in areas of the Society of American Archivists.

=== History ===
Although many women archivists helped shaped the SAA, the status of women in the archival profession did not receive much attention until the 1970s. In 1972, the SAA established the Committee on the Status of Women in the Archival Profession. The committee sought to address under representation and identify the barriers and obstacles for advancement. The overall membership population of women had grown since the SAA&#x27;s inception, but few had risen to the positions of president, officer, or council member.

The committee conducted two surveys, one of archivists and one of directors. Through these surveys, the committee discovered that although many women had comparable education and experience, few of them had risen to administrative positions.

At the same time that the committee was created, the Women&#x27;s Caucus was founded and began publishing &quot;The SAA Women&#x27;s Caucus Newsletter&quot;.

In 1998, the Committee evolved into the Women&#x27;s Professional Archival Issues Roundtable. In 2000, this name was changed to the Women Archivists Roundtable. In 2017, the name was changed once again to its current name, the Women Archivists Section (WArS), like the rest of the SAA groups.

=== Surveys ===
In 2000 and 2001, the WAR Steering Committee created a survey to analyze the relationship between women archivists and the archival profession. The survey was completed and published in August 2001 and included 227 women archivists. The survey found that most of the members (77.1%) came from East of the Rocky Mountains and 50.2% represented the academic sector as professional staff (69.6%) or archivist (53.2%). Most of them held a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree (97.2%) as well as a Master&#x27;s (63.6%) and/or a Master&#x27;s in Library Science (54.3%). 73% were members of the SAA while only 10% were members of WAR. Supervisors were 54.4% women and only 24.1% stated that they put in no overtime. And finally, &quot;98.7% of respondents felt that unearthing women&#x27;s history continues to be important, yet only 77.1% make a concerted effort to do so and only 61.9% of respondents actually work with materials related specifically to women.&quot;

More recent surveys have indicated the rise of women in archival professions, or even a &quot;feminization&quot; of the profession. Yet Wikipedia does not show this. In 2016, research discovered that only 50 articles exist on Wikipedia for female archivists, compared to 260 for male archivists. And for specifically American archivists, only 15 existed for women compared to 93 for men. So in 2016, WArS hosted a in Atlanta, and remotely, to encourage more women editors and more articles on women archivists.

In a survey conducted in 2017, researchers found that of the 2,170 respondents, 1,717 were members of the SAA, which was at a membership of over 6,000 in 2017. Therefore, this survey reflected about one quarter of the SAA membership in 2017. Of the total respondents, 87.7% were white and 84.3% were female. Only 3.1% responded stating they were African American, while 3.6% answered they were Latinx American and 3.2% said they were bi- or multi-racial. Over 92% stated that the highest education they&#x27;d received was a Master&#x27;s degree. Since 1956, which had a membership of 33% women, the percentage of women membership has grown to be over 82%.

=== Today ===
The Roundtable is governed by two co-chairs who must be members of the SAA, and they are elected on staggered two-year terms. On their website, WAR states their mission is to &quot;ensure that the Society of American Archivists (SAA) conscientiously deals with issues that affect the status of women within the profession and the Society.&quot; Under their goals and objectives, they have aimed to:

* Monitor the status of women within the archival profession.
* Encourage the participation of women in all phases of SAA business and other activities as well as in the archival profession as a whole.
* Monitor gender balance on SAA programs.
* Nominate candidates for Fellow in SAA.
* Monitor the continuance of day care at the SAA annual meeting.
* Meet annually in conjunction with the SAA meeting.
* Conduct its business in accordance with Section IX. of the SAA Governance Manual.

== Publications ==
On top of book publications, SAA offers the following regular publications:

* &quot;American Archivist&quot;: the peer-reviewed scholarly journal of SAA. Published semi-annually, it aims to cover theoretical and practical aspects of the profession, cultural, legal, technological, as well as social issues surrounding collecting, preserving, and accessing archival records and materials through journal articles, case studies, and product reviews.
* &quot;Archival Outlook&quot;: formally the &quot;SAA Newsletter&quot;. Started in the 1970s, the newsletter is published 6 times a year and focuses on best practices of the profession, day to day concerns of the archivist, and updates on organization business.
* &quot;In the Loop&quot;: bi-weekly e-newsletter that offers updates on SAA activities and interests.

== Awards ==
The Society recognizes archivists&#x27; achievements with awards for advocacy, writing, and contributions to the profession. The highest honor is that of Fellow, a distinction awarded since 1957. Every year, there is a new Distinguished Fellows Class, which cannot exceed 5% of the total SAA membership in a given year. To qualify for nomination, a candidate must meet all the academic and technical requirements of the profession, be a member of the organization for at least 7 years, and make significant and high quality contributions in the form of scholarly writing, running workshops, and participating in the organization&#x27;s leadership or other administrative roles.

In 1974, after the death of Sister M. Claude Lane, an award was sponsored in her name by the Society of Southwest Archivists. It is awarded annually by the SAA while being fully established, sponsored, and funded by the Society of Southwest Archivists.

The SAA also recognizes graduate students of color who are interested in the archival profession. The award was first established in 1993 and was later named after Harold T. Pinkett.

<doc id="1179890" wikidata="Q648913" url="?curid=1179890" title="Pyroxenite">
<text>Pyroxenite is an ultramafic igneous rock consisting essentially of minerals of the pyroxene group, such as augite, diopside, hypersthene, bronzite or enstatite. Pyroxenites are classified into clinopyroxenites, orthopyroxenites, and the websterites which contain both types of pyroxenes (see diagram below). Closely allied to this group are the hornblendites, consisting essentially of hornblende and other amphiboles.

They are essentially of igneous origin, though some pyroxenites are included in the metamorphic Lewisian complex of Scotland where the pyroxene-rich rocks result from the type of contact metamorphism known as pyroxene-hornfels facies, have siliceous sediment or basaltic protoliths, and are respectively metapelites and metabasites.

==Intrusive and mantle pyroxenites==

Igneous pyroxenites are closely allied to gabbros and norites, from which they differ by the absence of feldspar, and to peridotites, which are distinguished from them by containing more than 40% olivine. This connection is indicated also by their mode of occurrence, for they usually accompany masses of gabbro and peridotite and seldom are found by themselves.

They are often very coarse-grained, containing individual crystals which may be several inches in length. The principal accessory minerals, in addition to olivine and feldspar, are chromite and other spinels, garnet, magnetite, rutile, and scapolite.

Pyroxenites can be formed as cumulates in ultramafic intrusions by accumulation of pyroxene crystals at the base of the magma chamber. Here they are generally associated with gabbro and anorthite cumulate layers and are typically high up in the intrusion. They may be accompanied by magnetite layers, ilmenite layers, but rarely chromite cumulates.

Pyroxenites are also found as layers within masses of peridotite. These layers most commonly have been interpreted as products of reaction between ascending magmas and peridotite of the upper mantle. The layers typically are a few centimeters to a meter or so in thickness. Pyroxenites that occur as xenoliths in basalt and in kimberlite have been interpreted as fragments of such layers. Although some mantle pyroxenites contain garnet, they are not eclogites, as clinopyroxene in them is less sodic than omphacite and the pyroxenite compositions typically are unlike that of basalt. Pyroxenites might play an important role in basalt genesis (e.g., Lambart et al., 2016), either by contributing directly to the magma production, or indirectly as the result of reaction between peridotite and magma derived from partial melting of eclogite (e.g., Sobolev and others, 2007).

==Pyroxenite lavas==
Purely pyroxene-bearing volcanic rocks are rare, restricted to spinifex-textured sills, lava tubes and thick flows in the Archaean greenstone belts. Here, the pyroxenite lavas are created by in-situ crystallisation and accumulation of pyroxene at the base of a lava flow, creating the distinctive spinifex texture, but also occasionally mesocumulate and orthocumulate segregations. This is in essence similar to the formation of olivine spinifex textures in komatiite lava flows, the chemistry of the magma differing only to favor crystallisation of pyroxene.

A type locality is the Gullewa Greenstone Belt, in the Murchison region of Western Australia, and the Duketon Belt near Laverton, where pyroxene spinifex lavas are closely associated with gold deposits.

==Distribution==
They frequently occur in the form of dikes or segregations in gabbro and peridotite: in Shetland, Cortland on the Hudson River, North Carolina (websterite), Baltimore, New Zealand, and in Saxony. They are also found in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa and The Great Dyke in Zimbabwe.
The pyroxenites are often subject serpentinization under low temperature retrograde metamorphism and weathering. The rocks are often completely replaced by serpentines, which sometimes preserve the original structures of the primary minerals, such as the lamination of hypersthene and the rectangular cleavage of augite. Under pressure-metamorphism hornblende is developed and various types of amphibolite and hornblende-schist are produced. Occasionally rocks rich in pyroxene are found as basic facies of nepheline syenite; a good example is provided by the melanite pyroxenites associated with the &quot;borolanite&quot; variety found in the Loch Borralan igneous complex of Scotland.

<text>Leif Erland Andersson (4 November 1943 – 4 May 1979) was a Swedish astronomer.

== Early life ==

Andersson had been a child prodigy who won the Swedish television quiz show &quot;10.000-kronorsfrågan&quot; (&quot;The 10,000 Kronor Question&quot;) at the age of 16.

From his late teen years, he was also a well-known science fiction fan in Sweden, who chaired the MalCon in 1966 in Malmö and took over editing the pioneering Swedish science fiction amateur journal, the &quot;Scandinavian Amateur Press Alliance&quot; (SAPA) after John-Henri Holmberg left the position some time after 1964.

== Professional career ==

Andersson studied astronomy at Lund University, but received a scholarship to San Michele Observatory in on the island of Anacapri in Sicily in 1968.

He studied the work of Professor Åke Wallenquist, at Uppsala University. Andersson later went to Indiana University Bloomington to complete his PhD degree. While there, he married Gloria Ptacek in 1973 at the Beck Chapel of Indiana University.

Andersson was hired in a post-doctoral research associate position in the summer of 1973 by Dr. Gerard Kuiper at the Lunar &amp; Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Andersson calculated the first observable transits of Pluto and Charon (that took place in the early 1980s) but did not live to see them.

He mapped the far side of the Moon in NASA&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Lunar Nomenclature&quot;, with co-author Ewen Whitaker, published in 1982.

== Death ==

The crater &quot;Andersson&quot; on the Moon was named in his memory.

In honor of Leif Andersson&#x27;s work on the determination of Pluto&#x27;s pole position, the Spacewatch Asteroid Project at the University of Arizona&#x27;s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory named the asteroid 9223 Leifandersson on 24 January 2000 ().

The University of Arizona&#x27;s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory Leif Erland Andersson Award for Service and Outreach is awarded annually to a Planetary Science graduate student in recognition for attention to broader impacts and involvement in activities outside of academic responsibilities that benefit the department, university, and the larger community.

<text>Terveet Kädet are a Finnish hardcore punk band. The group was founded in Tornio in January 1980. They have had a major influence on bands from all over the world, especially in Brazil (which some have claimed was because of a member from the leading band Olho Seco and his enthusiasm and connections to that country&#x27;s scene). Max Cavalera of Sepultura and Soulfly has mentioned Terveet Kädet as one of his all-time favourite bands.

The band&#x27;s line-up changed several times, and the singer Veli-Matti &quot;Läjä&quot; Äijälä was the only permanent member. The band announced on its Facebook page in March 2016 that it was disbanded. Svart Records released complete works of the band from 1980&#x27;s as an omnibus release &quot;TK Pop 1980-1989&quot; in 2019. Läjä Äijälä&#x27;s current band Lapin Helvetti played a short tour to promote the release in summer and autumn 2019 playing only songs from the release. 

The name &quot;Terveet Kädet&quot; means &quot;Healthy Hands&quot;.

<doc id="1179901" wikidata="Q4602386" url="?curid=1179901" title="2003–04 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 2003–04 network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 2003 through August 2004. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 2002–03 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.
Other Legend
* Light blue indicates local programming.
* Gray indicates encore programming.
* Blue-gray indicates news programming.
* Light green indicates sporting events.
* Light Purple indicates movies. 
* Red indicates series being burned off and other scheduled programs, including specials.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Also not included are stations affiliated with Pax TV, as its schedule is composed mainly of syndicated reruns although it also carried a limited schedule of first-run programs.

The 2003–2004 season marked the final time that the major networks scheduled substantial original scripted drama series on Saturdays. After years of declining ratings on that particular evening, beginning with the 2004–2005 season the networks ceased scheduling original dramas on Saturdays, choosing instead to fill the schedule with non-fiction programming and reruns.

From August 13 to 29, 2004, all of NBC&#x27;s primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Sunday==
NOTE: On Fox, &quot;The Ortegas&quot; was supposed to air at 8:30-9, but it was cancelled.

<text>Diallage is an inosilicate, meaning it is a chain silicate, and is a part of the pyroxene group. Diallage is a junction between augite and diopside, just like fassaite. It was named in 1801 by René Just Haüy. Its name derives from the Greek word &quot;diallaghé&quot; (meaning change, transform, difference), as its composition differs from that of the other minerals in the pyroxene group. It is a fairly common mineral, and is cheap.

== Properties ==
Diallage is typically an opaque mineral, but translucent specimens can occur. This mineral forms tabular crystals, meaning the crystals are flatter, and slightly longer than wide. These crystals occur as lamellar masses, meaning the crystals stack on top of each other, and form big chunks. It is a heavy, hard mineral, however, it is fragile. It is not soluble in any acid. According to the Von Kobell-scale, its melting point is high, though the exact melting point of said mineral is not specified. Due to alteration, diallage can grow spots on its surface, which are made out of smaragdite (the green variety of amphibole). It is not surprising, due to both minerals being inosilicates. This alteration is caused by metamorphosis. The spots can also be caused by uralite, another variety of amphibole, as both of them are an alteration product of the diallage. This mineral can also be found interlaminated with bronzite as well, other than smaragdite and uralite. The metallic luster of the mineral is due to something known as schillerization, where diallage goes under an alteration which makes it earn its metallic luster it is known of. When the crystal forms, there are secondary minerals, which are hydrated oxides, such as opal, goethite and limonite. These become microscopic inclusions as diallage grows over the secondary minerals, and these minerals partly or fully fill the cavities. Thanks to these minute inclusions, the mineral reflects the light so that it creates a metallic luster, or the effect commonly known as &quot;schiller&quot;.

== Identification ==
If inspected without the use of tools, it is easy to confuse diallage with other members of both the orthopyroxenes and the clinopyroxenes. For example, metalloidal diallage can easily be confused with hypersthene (hence the pseudohyperstene being diallage&#x27;s synonym), however it is easy to distinguish them apart just by looking at its optical properties, its luster and its cleavage. Without having proper equipment, diallage could be distinguished from other members of the class due to having a metallic luster and thin foliated structure.

== Occurrences ==
Diallage is commonly found in association with other members of the augite series within the clinopyroxenes, such as with fassaite. It can also be found with other minerals, such as olivine, biotite and hornblende. It is a deep-seated igneous (also known as magmatic) mineral, and it is intrusive, meaning it crystallizes below the Earth&#x27;s surface, and the slow cooling allows the crystallization to occur. It usually grows in basic igneous rocks like gabbros and peridotite, and in low-grade metamorphic rocks such as metagabbros. Furthermore, diallage is an essential constituent of gabbros. It can also occur in serpentines, but rarely ever in schists and basalt.

== Localities ==
Typically, this mineral can be found in Europe, and is mostly common in Italy. In Romania, it can be found in the area of Svinița in gabbros, and in peridotites near Szarvaskő in Hungary. It can be found basically anywhere in Italy where there are basic igneous rocks and/or low-grade metamorphic rocks. It can also be found in the western region of the Alps, around Sondalo, however these specimens are generally lower quality ones. Higher grade specimens occur in Trento, and in a few spots of the Ligurian Apennines. These spots include Passo del Bracco, the mines of Acquafredda and Bargone, next to Sestri Levante. Another occurrence is in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, in Sasso Puzzino and Serra del Zanchetto, near Bologna. Other than these, diallage also occurs in Austria, Germany, and in the Polish Silesia as well.

== Controversies ==
Although it was supposed to be a legitimate variant of diopside, gemdat.org claims diallage to be a 19th-century name variant of some stones of the amphibole and pyroxene groups. The site also claims that most specimens under this name are either hypersthenes or diopsides. However, pseudohyperstene is also a synonym for diallage, therefore it is not a hypersthene, as pseudo means not genuine. Furthermore, opinions whether it is a distinct species or a variant differ. Even the reason for why it&#x27;s a variant, or which mineral&#x27;s variant it is, differs. Mindat claims it is a variant since the parting is different, while Wiktionary states that it is a green variety of pyroxene. Britannica claims diallage to be either of the pyroxenes augite and diopside. Furthermore, the formula of the mineral differs from site to site. On the Hungarian Wikipedia, diallage has the formula of Ca7Fe2+Mg6Fe3+Al(Si14Al2O48), while on mindat.org it has the formula of CaMgSi2O6. Furthermore, in the &quot;Minerali Collection&quot; journal, diallage is given the following formula: Ca(Mg,Al)(Al,Si,Al2)SiO6. In addition, theodora.com claims the mineral&#x27;s composition to be the same as diopside&#x27;s, however the site also says that it sometimes contains magnesium, aluminium and iron molecules, when it is actually similar to augite in composition (thus diallage being a junction between the two minerals). The fact that the journal claims the Mohs scale to be between 5 - 6, with a specific gravity of 3.2 - 3.3, with theodora.com and the Merriam-Webster dictionary stating it has a Mohs of 4 and a gravity of 3.2 - 3.35, adds confusion to the situation.

<doc id="1179913" wikidata="Q7552385" url="?curid=1179913" title="Society of Archivists">
<text>The Society of Archivists (SoA), which was in existence from 1947 to 2010, was the principal professional body for archivists, archive conservators and records managers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2010 the Society amalgamated with the National Council on Archives (NCA) and the Association of Chief Archivists in Local Government (ACALG) to become the Archives and Records Association (United Kingdom and Ireland), otherwise known as the ARA. Of the three bodies which merged, the Society was by far the largest, and many of its structures and activities were inherited by the new body with little obvious change.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1947 as the Society of Local Archivists, but changed its name to the Society of Archivists in 1954 due to its membership expanding beyond archivists working in local government.

==Aims==
The Society was constituted as a registered charity with the express aim to:
* Foster the care and preservation of archives in the public interest and to promote the better administration of archive repositories
* Advance the professional education and training of Archivists, Archive Conservators and Records Managers and those engaged in related activities
* Commission and support research into the creation, use, administration and conservation of archives and the development of new techniques and the publication of the useful results of such research.

==Membership==
In 2010, the Society had over 2,000 members, mainly made up of professional archivists, records managers and archive conservators from all the different types of organisations that employ such professionals. Through an affiliate membership scheme, those who worked at a paraprofessional level or who were generally interested in the work of the Society and its members were also able to join. There was a student membership option for those who were studying for a professional qualification in archives, records management or archive conservation.

==Structure==
The Society was governed by a Council (partially elected every two years), along with a number of committees and sub-committees relating to specific areas of business. The membership was divided geographically into eleven regions spanning the UK and Ireland, each with its own regional committee. Seven special interest groups also existed, representing members’ different employment backgrounds and/or concerns.

The Society had an office in Taunton, Somerset, which dealt with day-to-day administration. In 2010, this was taken over by the Archives and Records Association.

==Publications==
The Society published a biannual publication entitled the &quot;Journal of the Society of Archivists&quot;, covering mainly professional issues. After the creation of the Archives and Records Association in 2010, the title remained &quot;Journal of the Society of Archivists&quot; until 2012 (volume 33); after which, from 2013, the journal was retitled the &quot;Archives and Records: The Journal of the Archives and Records Association&quot;.

The Society also published a monthly newsletter, &quot;ARC&quot; (Archives, Records Management, Conservation); and a fortnightly recruitment supplement called &quot;ARC Recruitment&quot;. Periodically more in depth guides on particular types of records or professional issues were published.

*Margaret Procter &amp; Michael Cook &quot;Manual of Archival Description&quot;; 3rd ed. Aldershot: Gower, 2000 

==Training==
In terms of professional training for archives and records management, the Society accredited externally provided postgraduate diploma/degree programmes. For some twenty years the Society itself ran a distance-learning Diploma in Archives Administration, but this was discontinued in 2001.

For archive conservation, the Society ran a Certificate in Archive Conservation as an in-service scheme restricted to Society members only. It was also involved in the Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers (PAC-R) scheme.

Other training events for members were organised by the Regional committees or Special Interest Groups of the Society and co-ordinated by the Society&#x27;s Training Officer.

Professional members were encouraged to participate in the Society&#x27;s Registration Scheme, which acted as a formal process of continued professional development. A register was first established in 1987, initially with a clause allowing professional members to be accepted automatically if they had been working in a recognised post for at least two years. This clause was closed in 1996, and full completion of the scheme made the only way to become a Registered Member of the Society of Archivists (RMSA).

<doc id="1179923" wikidata="Q374189" url="?curid=1179923" title="Alan Hansen">
<text>Alan David Hansen (born 13 June 1955) is a Scottish former footballer and BBC television football pundit. Regarded as one of the greatest defenders and also one of the greatest Scottish players of all time, he played as a central defender for Partick Thistle, for the successful Liverpool team of the late 1970s and 1980s, and for the Scotland national team. Following his retirement from playing, Hansen became a football pundit, most notably on Match of the Day from 1992 to 2014. He became well known for his outspoken views, particularly on teams&#x27; defensive performances, frequently criticising what he believed was &quot;diabolical&quot; or &quot;shocking&quot; defending.

==Early life==
Hansen was born in Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and attended Lornshill Academy and supported Rangers growing up. His paternal grandfather was Danish. Hansen played his early football (along with his older brother John, a one-club player) at Scottish Junior league club, Sauchie Juniors near Alloa.

At the age of 15, Hansen ran into a plate-glass panel after playing volleyball and was left with a large scar on his forehead. The glass was in a brand-new youth club which Hansen attended. During his two-hour hospital stay he had 27 stitches in his head. He sued the education authority and won the case. Hansen stopped playing football between the ages of 15 and 17 and concentrated on playing golf, with aspirations of becoming a professional. His father and brother wanted Hansen to play football, so he accepted the offer of a trial with Hibernian when he was 17. Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull offered Hansen a professional contract, but he refused because it would have stopped him from playing golf competitively.

==Club career==
===Partick Thistle===
Hansen turned down the opportunity to study at the University of Aberdeen, in order to join his older brother John at Partick Thistle. During the summer while his application was being processed, he worked for six weeks in the offices of General Accident insurance — which he hated. As a trainee, Hansen attended the 1971 Scottish League Cup Final, seeing a Partick Thistle side that included his brother John create one of the biggest shocks ever in Scottish football by defeating favourites Celtic 4–1 at Hampden Park.

After breaking into the first team at Thistle, Hansen was watched by top clubs, including Bob Paisley&#x27;s Liverpool. In 1975–76 season Hansen played 21 times as Thistle won the Scottish First Division championship to gain entry into the Scottish Premier Division. By the end of the following season Hansen had 35 first team appearances, before moving south of the border to Liverpool on 5 May 1977. After arriving at Anfield, the nickname which he loathed for years (&quot;Stretch&quot;) was forgotten and a new nickname &quot;Jockey&quot; was born.

===Liverpool===
Liverpool signed Hansen for a fee of £100,000. He made his debut on 24 September 1977 in a league match at Anfield. Derby County were the visitors and were beaten by a single goal scored by Terry McDermott. Hansen scored his first goal the following month on 19 October during a European Cup 2nd round 1st leg tie at Anfield. He opened the scoring in the 14th minute as Liverpool defeated East German side Dynamo Dresden 5–1.

Hansen was put into the first team sporadically throughout the season. He was not in the side which lost the 1978 League Cup final replay to Nottingham Forest, but he was selected for the Liverpool side which won the 1978 European Cup Final 1–0 over FC Bruges at Wembley, on a goal by Kenny Dalglish. Hansen managed 18 appearances in the First Division that season, where Liverpool finished runners-up to Nottingham Forest.

In the following season, 1978–79, Hansen was a regular in the team as Liverpool regained the league title. The team&#x27;s final points tally of 68 was a record under the two points for a win system, and they conceded only four goals at home at Anfield. When long-serving club captain Emlyn Hughes was sold to Wolves, Hansen became an automatic first-choice central defender in the team, and Liverpool&#x27;s domination of English club football continued in the 1979–80 season with another league title.

In the 1980–81 season, Liverpool won two trophies, but did not win a third consecutive league title as Aston Villa finished as English champions. Liverpool won their first League Cup in 1981, defeating West Ham United 2–1 in a replay at Villa Park. Hansen also won his second European Cup winners medal in 1981, Liverpool defeating Real Madrid 1–0 at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 27 May.

The league title returned to Anfield in the 1981–82 season, and Liverpool also retained the League Cup in 1982 with a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, although Hansen missed this victory with injury. Liverpool did not retain the European Cup in 1982, surprisingly losing in the quarter-final to CSKA Sofia 2–1 on aggregate.

In the 1982–83 season, Liverpool once again took the league title and held on to the League Cup in 1983, defeating Manchester United 2–1 after extra-time in the final at Wembley. Bob Paisley, who signed Hansen for Liverpool in 1977, retired at the end of the 1982–83 season and was replaced as manager by long-serving coach Joe Fagan.

In the 1983–84 season, Liverpool completed a treble of trophies in Fagan&#x27;s first season as manager, winning the league title, League Cup and European Cup. Hansen was involved in a controversial incident in the League Cup final at Wembley when he appeared to handle a shot on the goal line. Despite protests from opponents and Merseyside rivals Everton, no penalty was given. Liverpool won the final after a replay at Maine Road.

Liverpool reached the 1984 European Cup final after beating Romanian champions Dinamo Bucharest 3–1 on aggregate in the semi-final. The first leg at Anfield was an ill-tempered affair with Liverpool captain Graeme Souness breaking the jaw of a Bucharest midfielder. Hansen played in the European Cup final victory over A.S. Roma, which Liverpool won on a penalty shoot-out after the match ended 1–1 in front of a crowd of 69,000 at Roma&#x27;s home stadium, the Stadio Olimpico.

Liverpool did not win a trophy in the 1984–85 season and were banned from all European competition after the 1985 European Cup Final which pitted Liverpool against the Italian giants Juventus at Heysel was preceded by rioting which caused the deaths of 39 people, including 32 Italian Juventus fans. Liverpool lost the match 1–0. Hansen would never play in a European tie again.

Manager Joe Fagan retired after the Heysel disaster, and Hansen&#x27;s friend, teammate and fellow Scotsman Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager. He gave Hansen the captaincy and the season ended in triumph, as in 1986 Liverpool became only the third side in the 20th century to complete a League and FA Cup &quot;double&quot;, following Tottenham in 1961 and Arsenal in 1971. Hansen lifted both trophies as captain and earned his first FA Cup winners&#x27; medal, thereby completing the domestic set.

Liverpool failed to win a trophy in the 1986–87 season, losing the League Cup final at Wembley when Arsenal defeated them 2–1, while Merseyside rivals Everton took the league title. In the 1987–88 season they lost just twice in the league winning the title with Hansen as skipper. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup final, but were denied a second &quot;double&quot; when they were beaten 1–0 by Wimbledon in one of the competition&#x27;s biggest shocks. Two days later, 31,000 attended Anfield for Hansen&#x27;s testimonial match against an England XI preparing for UEFA Euro 1988.

Hansen was restricted to just six league appearances in the 1988–89 season as a result of a dislocated left knee sustained in a pre-season friendly against Atlético Madrid in Spain. Hansen played in the 1989 FA Cup final at Wembley, which Liverpool won 3–2 in extra-time against Everton, though Hansen did not lift the trophy as captain. The honour was given to teammate Ronnie Whelan who had deputised in Hansen&#x27;s absence through injury and retained the role even after the club&#x27;s first choice captain was fit again. Hansen did not have any objections to Whelan keeping the captaincy that season.

After winning the 1989 FA Cup, Liverpool were denied a second &quot;double&quot; in four seasons when they lost the League title to Arsenal on 26 May 1989. Michael Thomas scored a crucial last minute goal for Arsenal at Anfield that gave the North Londoners a 2–0 win. This resulted in Arsenal winning the league title on goals scored after the two teams had finished the season with the same number of points and exactly the same goal difference.

Hansen made more appearances the following season but his persistent knee problems continued to affect his fitness although he still captained Liverpool to another League title, which made it eight individually for Hansen, which was a record at the time. The club came close to the &quot;double&quot; yet again, but lost an FA Cup semi-final 4–3 in extra-time to Crystal Palace at Villa Park.

Hansen was unable to play in any competitive games during the 1990–91 season (when Liverpool finished second in the league and were trophyless for only the third time since Hansen&#x27;s arrival 14 years earlier) and he retired in March 1991, a month after Kenny Dalglish resigned as manager. At this stage Ronnie Moran was caretaker manager until the appointment of Graeme Souness in the permanent position shortly afterwards.

In Hansen&#x27;s playing career for Liverpool, his winners medals include eight league titles, three European Cups, two FA Cups and four League Cups.

====Hillsborough disaster====
On 15 April 1989, the Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 94 Liverpool fans (eventually rising to 97). Hansen was selected for the FA Cup semi-final match against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, playing the opening six minutes of the match before it was abandoned. Hansen attended 12 funerals and visited the injured in hospital.

In his autobiography, Hansen described the tragedy as &quot;the blackest period of my life&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The number of broken hearts was incalculable. The immediate aftermath, when Kenny Dalglish and the players attended the funerals and tried to show support for the grieving families took more out of me emotionally than any other experience I have gone through.&quot; On &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in April 2009, Hansen spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: &quot;It was a horrific time, traumatic for everybody. It must never be forgotten.&quot; In 2010, Hansen said that each of the funerals that he attended after Hillsborough got harder. &quot;The emotional scars will be there forever,&quot; he said.

In an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hansen responded to the Hillsborough Independent Panel report of September 2012, by writing: &quot;I have encountered ignorance about Hillsborough on many occasions, finding myself having to correct the inaccurate version of events. The report explicitly removes the excuse of ignorance for those who misunderstood the tragedy. Each sentence in it reads as a tribute to the honesty, integrity and dignity of the families and is an acknowledgement of everything they have been saying since those first, scurrilous accusations surfaced.&quot;

==International career==
Having previously appeared for the under-23 side, Hansen made his full debut for Scotland on 19 May 1979 in a British Home Championship match against Wales in front of 20,000 spectators at Ninian Park, Cardiff. Scotland manager Jock Stein gave debuts to four Scottish players that day – George Burley, John Wark, Paul Hegarty and Hansen. Hosts Wales won the match 3–0 against a somewhat inexperienced Scottish line-up, with striker John Toshack scoring a hat-trick for Wales.

Hansen&#x27;s second Scotland cap came the following month on 2 June 1979 in a prestigious Saturday afternoon friendly match at Glasgow&#x27;s Hampden Park against reigning World Champions Argentina. On the hottest day in Glasgow for 30 years, the 61,000 sun-drenched crowd at Hampden Park saw the South Americans beat Scotland 3–1, with an 18-year-old Diego Maradona scoring his first international goal for Argentina in a virtuoso display of skill and trickery. In an interview in 2007, Hansen said that Maradona was &quot;without a shadow of a doubt the best player I came up against. He was virtually unplayable – even at 18.&quot;

Hansen played for Scotland in the 1982 World Cup in Spain. The team failed to progress beyond the qualifying group, having drawn 2–2 with the USSR when Scotland needed a win to progress in the tournament. An accidental collision between Hansen and central defensive partner Willie Miller allowed USSR striker Ramaz Shengelia through to score the Soviets&#x27; second goal.

A formidable Scotland central defensive partnership was formed between Willie Miller and Alex McLeish of Aberdeen, who were managed by Alex Ferguson. Ferguson, who took charge of the national team after the sudden death of Jock Stein, dropped Hansen from the squad for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Hansen disagreed with the decision, as he felt that his form in the 1985–86 season (when Liverpool had won a league and cup double) was near his best. However, both Ferguson and Stein had felt his attitude towards Scotland was wrong, and Ferguson made his mind up not to take Hansen to the World Cup after Hansen pulled out of a game against England in April 1986, stating he had a knee injury. He had played infrequently for Scotland before the tournament, and had often withdrawn from squads. Hansen won the last of his 26 Scotland caps in February 1987 in a 1–0 home defeat by Republic of Ireland at Hampden Park.

==Management offers==
Hansen was offered the Huddersfield Town job in 1992, following the sacking of Eoin Hand, but he turned it down. There were strong rumours that Hansen would be approached to take over as manager of Liverpool after his former captain Graeme Souness was sacked by the club in 1994. Hansen ruled himself out by stating that, despite his great affection for the club, he simply was not interested in coaching or management; a position he has maintained ever since Roy Evans got the job. Hansen also turned down an offer in 1995 to manage Manchester City, following the sacking of Brian Horton.

==Media career==

After rejecting the idea of management, when he retired from football in 1991 he planned to take three months off. After his wife pointed out that nobody had contacted them during his rest period, he started calling the networks. Sky Television employed Hansen as a pundit and summariser almost as soon as he ceased playing, and soon he had established enough of a reputation as a considered observer and thinker within the game for the BBC to approach him. He began working for BBC Radio 5 Live, before moving on to &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. Hansen was employed for 22 years as the main pundit for the BBC&#x27;s football coverage (rights to show matches or highlights permitting) and was known as a calm, authoritative, and rational analyst of the game who is particularly keen on highlighting the triumphs and &quot;shocking&quot;, &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;diabolical&quot; mistakes of defenders and commenting on &quot;mediocre&quot; performances. He became a columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Telegraph.co.uk&quot; and the BBC Sport website on football issues and has also worked as a motivational speaker.

Hansen is known for coining the phrase &quot;you can&#x27;t win anything with kids&quot;, having made the remark following Manchester United&#x27;s 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa on the opening day of the 1995–96 FA Premier League season. After selling three high-profile players (Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis) in the summer of 1995, United had introduced youth team players Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Gary Neville into the first team. United proved Hansen wrong by winning a Premier League and Cup double that season. Hansen later continued to repeat the phrase for humorous effect and said the phrase &quot;made him&quot; as a pundit, as people would shout it at him in public places.

In May 2013, it was reported that Hansen&#x27;s BBC contract was due to expire after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 5 September 2013, Hansen announced he would retire as a &quot;Match of the Day&quot; pundit following the 2014 World Cup. His last appearance on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; itself came on 11 May 2014, the final day of the 2013–14 English league season, with his last appearance as an analyst being for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final two months later.

Hansen covered sixteen FA Cup Finals, six FIFA World Cups, five UEFA European Championships and one Summer Olympic Games with the BBC.

===Controversies===

Commentating on the Argentina–Romania match in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Hansen said that &quot;the Argentine defender warrants shooting for a mistake like that&quot;. The previous day, Colombian defender Andrés Escobar had been shot dead, a killing widely attributed to punishment for an own goal Escobar scored in Colombia&#x27;s 2–1 loss to the United States earlier in the same tournament. The BBC issued a public apology for Hansen&#x27;s poor choice of words.

During an appearance on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; on 21 December 2011, while discussing the prominence of racism in English football following allegations against Premier League players Luis Suárez and John Terry, Hansen twice used the word &quot;coloured&quot; in reference to black footballers. The BBC received 82 complaints by the following morning while some, including Shamrock Rovers player Rohan Ricketts, criticised Hansen&#x27;s choice of words on social network Twitter. Others defended Hansen&#x27;s use of words. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; blogger and commentator Toby Young wrote: &quot;In his defence, Hansen could cite the fact that America&#x27;s foremost civil rights group is the NAACP which stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. If it&#x27;s acceptable for the NAACP to use the word &quot;coloured&quot;, why isn&#x27;t it acceptable for him?&quot; Hansen issued an apology the following day, saying: &quot;I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused – this was never my intention and I deeply regret the use of the word.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hansen lives in Southport with his wife Janet. They have been married since 1980, and have a son, Adam, and a daughter, Lucy.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Hansen was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

On 9 June 2024, Liverpool FC issued a press release expressing support for Hansen who was seriously ill in hospital. On 15 June, an on-air message of support was also made by &quot;Match of the Day&#x27;s&quot; Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker. Hansen was discharged from hospital on 23 June. A family statement thanked people for their messages of support.

Hansen was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to Association Football and Broadcasting.

<text>Dje (Ђ ђ; italics: &quot;Ђ&quot; &quot;ђ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

Dje is the sixth letter of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, used in Serbo-Croatian to represent the voiced alveolo-palatal affricate .

Dje corresponds to the Latin letter D with stroke (Đ đ) in Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet of Serbo-Croatian and is so transliterated. When strokes are unavailable, it is transliterated as or .

==History==
Dje was constructed by request of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. There were several proposed shapes of the letter (one by Pavle Solarić, another by Gligorije Geršić). The variant now in use was designed by Lukijan Mušicki; it was designed by modification of the letter Ћ, itself a revival of the old Cyrillic letter Djerv (Ꙉ). The new letter was adopted in Karadžić&#x27;s 1818 dictionary and thus entered widespread usage. There was also a Д and Ь ligature variant that has not been added in Unicode as a character, and was used before Dje took its current form.

Ѓ is used in Macedonian to represent the voiced palatal plosive .

Ѓ is most commonly romanised using the Latin letter G with acute . When the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was part of SFR Yugoslavia, the Macedonian () was also transliterated as &quot;đ&quot;, &quot;ģ&quot;, &quot;gj&quot;, or &quot;dj&quot;.

Words with this letter are often cognate with () in Bulgarian and in Serbo-Croatian. For example, the Macedonian word for &quot;birth&quot; ( is , which in Bulgarian is - , and in Serbian ).

<text>Dze (Ѕ ѕ; italics: &quot;Ѕ ѕ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script, used in the Macedonian alphabet to represent the voiced alveolar affricate , similar to the pronunciation of in &quot;needs&quot; or &quot;kids&quot; in English. It is derived from the letter &quot;dzelo&quot; or &quot;zelo&quot; of the Early Cyrillic alphabet, and it was used historically in all Slavic languages that use Cyrillic.

Although fully obsolete everywhere in the Cyrillic world by the 19th century, the letter &quot;zelo&quot; was revived in 1944 by the designers of the alphabet of the then-codified Macedonian language. The phoneme is also present in Greek (&quot;ΤΖ&quot; τζ) and Albanian (X x), both non-Slavic neighbours to the Macedonian language; all are a part of the Balkan linguistic area. In the early 21st century, the same letter also appeared in Vojislav Nikčević&#x27;s proposal for the new alphabet for the modern Montenegrin language. 

The most common early letterform () resembles the Latin letter S (S s), but it is also seen reversed () like the Latin letter Reversed S (Ƨ ƨ), or Z with a tail and a tick ().

Abkhaz has Abkhazian Dze (Ӡ ӡ), with an identical function and name but a different shape.

==Church Slavonic==

The letter is descended from ѕѣло (pronounced &quot;dzělo&quot;; ) in the Early Cyrillic alphabet, where it had the numerical value 6. The letter Dzělo was itself based on the letter Dzelo in the Glagolitic alphabet. In the Glagolitic alphabet, it was written , and had the numerical value of 8. In Old Church Slavonic it was called ѕѣло (pronounced &quot;dzeló&quot;), and in Church Slavonic it is called ѕѣлѡ (pronounced &quot;zeló&quot;).

The origin of Glagolitic letter Dzelo is unclear, but the Cyrillic Ѕ may have been influenced by the Greek stigma , the medieval form of the archaic letter digamma, which had the same form and numerical value (6). Thus the visual similarity of the Cyrillic and Latin is largely coincidental.

The initial sound of in Old Church Slavonic was a soft or , which usually came from a historically palatalised *g (ноѕѣ, ѕвѣзда, etc.). In almost all Slavic dialects this sound was pronounced as a simple /z/; however, as the Old Church Slavonic language was based on the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects, the sound remained distinct. 

In the Old Slavic period the difference between and had already begun to be blurred, and in the written Church Slavonic language from the middle of the 17th century was used only formally. The letter&#x27;s distinguishing features from are:
* is used in root derived from these seven words beginning with : ѕвѣзда, ѕвѣрь, ѕеліе, ѕлакъ, ѕлый, ѕмій, ѕѣлѡ (&quot;star, beast, vegetable, herb, angry, dragon, very&quot;);
* is used in all remaining cases.
* has the numerical value of 6, whereas has the numerical value of 7;

==East Slavic Languages==

In Russian it was known as зѣло or &quot;zelo&quot; and had the phonetic value of or . In the initial version of Russian civil script of Tsar Peter I (1708), the was assigned the sound , and the letter was removed. However, in the second version of the civil script (1710), was restored, and was abolished. Both versions of the alphabet were used until 1735, which is considered the date of the final elimination of in Russian.

In Ukrainian, the sound is integrated as part of the language&#x27;s phonology, but it mainly occurs in loanwords rather than in words of native Ukrainian origin. As such, the digraph is used to represent both the phoneme and the separately occurring consonant cluster which Ukrainian phonotactics assimilate as .

Belarusian commonly features , but it usually comes from *d from a similar development to Polish. As such, had never been used for it.

==South Slavic Languages==

 is now only used in the Macedonian alphabet. A commission formed to standardise the Macedonian language and orthography decided to adopt the letter on December 4, 1944, after a vote of 10-1. Despite the letter originally being found between and , in the new alphabet it was placed after instead. The letter represents (examples including: ѕид/&quot;dzid&quot;, &#x27;wall&#x27; and ѕвезда/&quot;dzvezda&quot;, &#x27;star&#x27;). The corresponding sound is used in all dialects of Macedonian.

 was also used to the middle of the 19th century in the Serbian civil script, whose orthography was closer to Church Slavonic (compared to Russian). Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s Serbian Cyrillic alphabet (1868) did not include , instead favouring a simple digraph to represent the sound, as it was non-native. is also included in Microsoft&#x27;s Serbian Cyrillic keyboard layout, although it is not used in the Serbian Cyrillic Alphabet. The Serbian keyboard in Ubuntu replaces Ѕ with a second Ж.

Modern Bulgarian, apart from when explicitly written with the Church Slavonic alphabet, has never used . Although most dialects feature it, it is found in neither the Tărnovo dialect, the prestige dialect of the time of codification, nor in the Church Slavonic language (despite being written independently there). A few eastern dialects, including the Tărnovo dialect, have, however, independently developed both /dz/ and /dʒ/ phonemes not found in the standard language due to affrication. Marin Drinov, one of the most important players in the establishment of Standard Bulgarian, floated the idea of using as it was found in most dialects, however chose not to as he considered the letter all but forgotten.

The Banat Bulgarian dialect, being based on the Paulician dialect, retains . However, as it is written with the Latin script, the sound is instead notated as .

== Romanian ==
 was used in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet (where it represented ) until the alphabet was abolished in favour of a Latin-based alphabet in 1860-62.

<text>Ukrainian Ye or Round Ye (Є є; italics: &quot;Є&quot; &quot;є&quot;) is a character of the Cyrillic script. It is a separate letter in the Ukrainian alphabet, the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet, and both the Carpathian Rusyn alphabets; in all of these, it comes directly after Е. In modern Church Slavonic, it is considered a variant form of Ye (Е е) (there, the selection of Є and Е is driven by orthography rules). Until the mid-19th century, Є/є was also used in Romanian and Serbian. Other modern Slavonic languages may use Є/є shapes instead of Е/е for decorative purposes. Then, the letter is usually referred to by the older name Yest (which also refers to the conventional Ye). If the two need to be distinguished, the descriptive name Broad E is sometimes used (in contrast with &quot;Narrow E&quot;). It can also be found in the writing of the Khanty language.

In Ukrainian, Є/є commonly represents the sound or like the pronunciation of in &quot;yes&quot;. (See usage for more detail.)

Ukrainian Ye is romanized as , , or even . See scientific transliteration of Cyrillic.

Ukrainian Ye also looks like a backwards version of Э judging by their appearance. (Є/Э)

==History==
Letter Є/є was derived from one of the variant forms of Cyrillic Ye (Е е), known as &quot;broad E&quot; or &quot;anchor E&quot;. Є-shaped letters can be found in late uncial (ustav) and semi-uncial (poluustav) Cyrillic manuscripts, especially ones of Ukrainian origin. Typically it corresponds to the letter Iotated E (Ѥ ѥ) of older monuments. Certain old primers and grammar books of Church Slavonic language had listed Є/є as a letter distinct from Е/е and placed it near the end of the alphabet (the exact alphabet position varies). Among modern-style Cyrillic scripts (known as &quot;civil script&quot; or &quot;Petrine script&quot;), Є/є was first used in Serbian books (end of the 18th century and first half of the 19th century); sometimes, Serbian printers might be using Э/э instead of Є/є due to font availability. For the modern Ukrainian language, Є/є has been used since 1837 (orthography of almanach &quot;Русалка Днѣстровая&quot; (Rusalka Dnistrovaya)). In Cyrillic numerals, Є is always preferred to E to represent 5.

==Usage==
===Ukrainian and Rusyn===
In Ukrainian and Rusyn, Є/є represents the sound combination or the vowel sound after a palatalized consonant.

It is the 8th letter of Ukrainian alphabet (in 1935-1992 it was the 7th, as Ґ was banned).

===Khanty===
In Khanty, the letter represents the sound /je/.

=== Old Serbian ===
In old Serbian orthography, Є/є represented same sounds as in Ukrainian and Rusyn: the sound combination or the vowel sound after a palatalized consonant.

The letter was eliminated in Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s alphabet and replaced by digraph је.

=== Old Slavonic, Old East Slavic ===
In the oldest Slavonic manuscripts, Є was just a graphical variant of Е and thus represents without palatalization. Later Є replaced Ѥ (i.e. denotes after consonants and after vowels and in an initial position). Later on, it also accepted both a decorative role (as an initial letter of a word, even if there was no iotation) and an orthographical role, to make the distinction between certain homonymical forms (mostly between plural and singular).

=== New Church Slavonic ===
Since the mid-17th century, the Church Slavonic orthography has the following main rules related to the usage of shapes Є and Е:
* in an initial position, always use Є;
* otherwise, use Е with the following exceptions:
** in noun&#x27;s endings, use -євъ and -ємъ for plural and -евъ, -емъ for singular;
** in other endings, suffixes and roots of nouns, adjectives, participles, numerals and pronouns, use Є for plural/dual, if there exists a homonymous form in the singular (either of the same word or a different one; the actual rule is much more complicated and not well-defined, as there are multiple other ways to eliminate such homonymy);
** publishers from Kyiv also use Є in the genitive case of three pronouns (менє, тебє, себє), and Е in the accusative case (мене, тебе, себе);
* as a numerical sign (with value 5) use Є, not Е (the rule has often been ignored outside of the Russian Empire).

In the modern Church Slavonic alphabet, the 6th letter is typically shown as Єєе (one uppercase accompanied with two variants of lowercase).

The different shapes Є and Е exist only in lowercase; thus in all caps and small caps styles, the distinction between Є and Е disappears.

Old Believers print their books using an older variant of New Church Slavonic language. Its orthography combines the fully formal system described above with the older tradition to use Є phonetically (after vowels, to represent iotated ).

=== Similar characters ===
The United States Federal Geographic Data Committee uses Ꞓ, a character similar to capital Є, to represent the Cambrian Period in geologic history.

Є is similar to the symbol for the euro currency .

<text>The Bala Lake Railway (Welsh: &quot;Rheilffordd Llyn Tegid&quot;) is a narrow-gauge railway along the southern shore of Bala Lake in Gwynedd, North Wales. The line, which is long, is built on a section of the former standard-gauge Ruabon–Barmouth GWR route that closed in 1965. Another section of the former permanent way is used by the Llangollen Railway. The Bala Lake Railway, which runs on -gauge preserved rolling stock, is a member of the Great Little Trains of Wales.

The railway now has the largest collection of historic narrow-gauge quarry locomotives built specifically for the slate industry in North Wales by the Hunslet Engine Company in Leeds.

==History==

===Standard Gauge===
The narrow-gauge Bala Lake railway uses the permanent way of the former standard-gauge GWR Ruabon–Barmouth line. The railway, which opened in August 1868, was built by the Bala and Dolgelley Railway Company. Its original route ran between the Corwen &amp; Bala Railway at and Cambrian Railways&#x27; station at . In 1877 it became part of the network operated by Great Western (GWR). In 1896 was redeveloped with the addition of a passing loop and second platform, extended building and a new signal box.

Passenger services through Bala Junction ceased on Monday 18 January 1965 when the line from to was closed. Although originally earmarked for dieselisation by the Western Region of British Railways in the early 1960s, the to Bala–Barmouth line was included in the 1963 Beeching Report. Traffic on the line was gradually reduced and facilities rationalised; the last scheduled through-rail service was the mail train from in December 1964. Long-distance holiday charter trains and through freight traffic were diverted on to the Cambrian main line via . Goods traffic finally ceased on 1 January 1968 when the branch at Pontcysyllte was closed.

===Narrow gauge===
By 1969 the track had been lifted. Reuse of the line as a narrow-gauge railway began when local engineer, George Barnes, saw the potential of the lakeside section for both local and tourist traffic. With the help of Tom Jones, then chairman of Merioneth County Council&#x27;s Finance Committee, they established &quot;Rheilffordd Llyn Tegid&quot; Ltd, the first company in Wales to be registered exclusively in the Welsh language.
Bala Lake Railway opened on 13 August 1972. In its first season, it operated a small industrial diesel engine with two open carriages on of track between Llanuwchllyn and Pentrepiod. Extension work continued throughout this period with the help of local ex-British Rail employees. The line was extended to Llangower by the start of 1973. In 1975 the line reached a new temporary station at Pant-yr-hen-felin. The following year the line reached Bala (Llyn Tegid), now known as Bala (Penybont). There were expansion plans to extend the line into Bala&#x27;s town centre by 1981 but these plans were abandoned early in that year.

The canopy at Llanuwchllyn was built in 1979 with supports which were made for the Cambrian Railways station at Pwllheli, but were relocated to Aberdovey in 1907 when Pwllheli station was moved. The stations along the line are:
*Llanuwchllyn, includes the main buildings, cafe, workshops and railway offices.
*Pentrepiod Halt, an operational request stop.
*Glan Llyn Halt, a limited-use station, open only during the Halloween and Santa Special train services.
*Llangower, principal intermediate station that all trains stop at. It has a passing loop for two-train services.
*Bryn Hynod Halt, a request stop that closed in 2011 (platform demolished in February 2012).
*Bala (Penybont), terminus located near the town of Bala.

The company now has the largest collection of historic narrow-gauge quarry locomotives built by the West Yorkshire Hunslet Engine Company specifically for the North Wales&#x27; slate industry.

=== Llanuwchllyn Heritage Centre ===
The Llanuwchllyn Heritage Centre is a museum of Welsh narrow-gauge railway located at Llanuwchllyn railway station. It won the 2020 Railway Heritage Association award for Outstanding Visitor Attraction. Exhibits on display include Hunslet Engine Company locomotive &quot;Nesta&quot; and a replica of Lord Penrhyn&#x27;s private carriage, both from the Penrhyn Quarry Railway. It also houses locomotives that are not currently in use which frees up spaces in the running shed and has a variety of exhibits relating to the quarry industry.

===Developments and expansion===
In 2010, the company revived plans to complete the final of the railway to Bala town centre. The Red Dragon Project, under the auspices of the Bala Lake Railway Trust, has been established to build the £2.5 million extension.

The plans also include: a new engine shed, a visitor centre, the rebuilding of the carriage shed, which was completed in 2019, and a new set of carriages.

In March 2017, the Trust announced that it had acquired land required in Bala for the new railway terminus.
In October 2019, the Trust purchased land from Bala Rugby Club for the extension of the line. A further area of land adjacent to the new station site was acquired in 2022 and will be used for sidings.

Over the weekend of 12/13 June 2021 the event &#x27;Bala Rerailed&#x27;, was held on the site of the new station in Bala using Winifred and a Penrhyn coach to provide rides to the public.

The preserved railway turned 50 in 2022 and staged a variety of events. These included: &#x27;Bala at 50&#x27; over the May Day Bank Holiday, complete with the launch of a pictorial album &quot;Bala Lake Railway, The First 50 Years, 1972 - 2022&quot;, and a celebratory beer; &#x27;Aur Bala/Bala Gold&#x27; on 13 August; and a &#x27;Gala&#x27; over August Bank Holiday.

==Rolling stock==

Steam locomotives currently in use or stored on the line are:
*&quot;Maid Marian&quot;, works number 822 (in use). Arrived on the line 1975. It has twice undergone overhaul supported by her owners, the Maid Marian Locomotive Fund.
* &quot;Winifred&quot;, works number 364 (in use). Was repatriated to the UK from a warehouse at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway USA in April 2012. Was restored to working condition in 2015.
* &quot;George B&quot;, works number 680 (in use). Entered service in April 2017.

Most of the locos were built by the Hunslet Engine Company for the Dinorwic and Penrhyn Quarries. The numerous Hunslet slate quarry steam locomotives have led the railway to market itself as the home of the Hunslet.

Until late 2011, ex Southam Cement Works Peckett &#x27;Triassic&#x27; was stored on the Bala Lake Railway, was relocated to the Statfold Barn Railway during the overhauls of Winifred and George B due to storage space issues, but returned in Summer 2016. Some locomotives can now be seen at other railways; &quot;Ashover&quot;, for example, is now at the Vale of Rheidol Railway.

The four main diesel locomotives are: 
* &quot;Meirionnydd&quot;, a Bo-Bo diesel-hydrostatic locomotive built by Severn Lamb of Stratford-upon-Avon in 1973, and based on a Western class standard-gauge locomotive outline.
* &quot;Trigger (Bob Davies)&quot;, a Baguley Drewery, works no. 780, which is the railway&#x27;s main standby diesel, used to haul out of season trains, for yard shunting and goods or works train haulage, which was built as 2 ft 6in gauge for the Royal Navy at Fishguard, purchased by Pete Briddon&#x27;s Yorkshire Engine Company, regauged to 600mm gauge, and named &#x27;Bob Davies&#x27; in honour of a remarkable local railwayman.
* &quot;Chilmark&quot;, Ruston &amp; Hornsby, works no. 194771, the oldest of the railway&#x27;s diesels (a 40DL diesel mechanical 3-speed built in 1939 for the Air Ministry), used by the Royal Air Force for hauling explosives and ammunition at RAF Chilmark, Wiltshire.
* &quot;Lady Madcap&quot;, a Ruston &amp; Hornsby 20DL, which sees only occasional use for light shunting and ballast ploughing.

<text>The dotted i (І і; italics: &quot;І і&quot;), also called Ukrainian I, decimal i (, after its former numeric value) or soft-dotted i, is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the close front unrounded vowel , like the pronunciation of ⟨i⟩ in English &quot;machine&quot;. It is used in the orthographies of Belarusian, Kazakh, Khakas, Komi, Carpathian Rusyn and Ukrainian and quite often, but not always, is the equivalent of the Cyrillic letter i (И и) as used in Russian and other languages. However, the letter І () was also used in Russian before the Bolshevik reform of 1918.

In Ukrainian, І is the twelfth letter of the alphabet and represents the sound i] in writing. Ukrainian uses и to represent the sound ɪ]. In Belarusian, I is the tenth letter of the alphabet. It represents i]. The two Carpathian Rusyn standard varieties use і, и and ы for three different sounds: , and , respectively. In Komi, і occurs only after the consonants д, з, л, н, с, and т and does not palatalize them, while и does. In Kazakh and Khakas, і represents .

Just like the Latin letters I/i (and J/j), the dot above the letter appears only in its lowercase form and then only if that letter is not combined with a diacritic above it (notably the diaeresis, used in Ukrainian to note the letter &quot;yi&quot; of its alphabet, and the macron). Even when the lowercase form is present without any other diacritic, the dot is not always rendered in historic texts (the same historically applied to the Roman letters i and j). Some modern texts and font styles, except for cursive styles, still discard the &quot;soft&quot; dot on the lowercase letter, because the text is readable without it. However, the current official rules of Belarusian orthography (2008) state that the letter is undotted in printed uppercase, but should be dotted in lowercase and in handwritten uppercase.

== History ==
The Cyrillic soft-dotted letter i was derived from the Greek letter iota (Ι ι). The dot came later with some typefaces through Western European influence, which similarly affected other Cyrillic letters such as а and е. The name of this letter in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;i&quot;), meaning &quot;and&quot;. In the Cyrillic numeral system, soft-dotted І had a value of 10.

In the early Cyrillic alphabet, there was little or no distinction between the Cyrillic letter i (И и), derived from the Greek letter eta, and the soft-dotted letter i. They both remained in the alphabetical repertoire, since they represented different numbers in the Cyrillic numeral system, eight and ten, respectively. They are, therefore, sometimes referred to as &quot;octal I&quot; and &quot;decimal I&quot;.

== Usage ==
=== Rules for usage in Russian (pre-1918) ===

* ⟨і⟩ was used before all vowels and before the semivowel ⟨й⟩ except at the end of a morpheme in a compound word, where ⟨и⟩ was used. So англійскій (&quot;English&quot;) used ⟨і⟩, but пяти + акровый = пятиакровый (&quot;five-acre&quot;) used ⟨и⟩.
* ⟨и⟩ was used as the last letter of a word and before consonants except in for &quot;world, universe, local community, commons, society, laity&quot; (and words derived from it) to differentiate from &quot;peace&quot;). After 1918, both are spelled .
* In a few words derived from Greek, use was derived etymologically based upon whether iota or eta was in the original Greek: &quot;Jesus&quot;, from Greek , now written ; also from , now written . However, since the middle of the 18th century loanwords came to be spelled according to the general rule: Іоаннъ but Иванъ, Никита (instead of Нiкита), Филиппъ (instead of Фiлiппъ).

According to critics of the Bolshevik reform, the choice of &quot;Ии&quot; as the only letter to represent that side and the removal of &quot;Іі&quot; defeated the purpose of &#x27;simplifying’ the language, as &quot;Ии&quot; occupies more space and, furthermore, is sometimes indistinguishable from &quot;Шш&quot;.

The reform also created many homographs and homonyms, which used to be spelled differently. Examples: есть/ѣсть (to be/eat) and миръ/міръ (peace/the Universe) became &quot;есть&quot; and &quot;мир&quot; in both instances.

===Usage in other languages===
In Macedonian, this letter, or the letter Й, was used by Macedonian authors to represent the sound /j/ until the introduction of the letter Ј. In Romanian the letter was used until 1860s when it gradually switched to modern Latin alphabet. In Bulgarian the letter was used until 1878, while in Ossetian it was used until 1923.

This letter is currently in use in Belarusian, Kazakh, Khakas, Komi, Carpathian Rusyn and Ukrainian, where it usually represents the sound /i/ (in Kazakh, /ɪ/). It is the tenth letter in Belarussian, the twelfth in Carpathian Rusyn and Ukrainian, the thirty-eighth in Kazakh and the eleventh in Komi.

===Dotted I with curve at bottom===

Dotted I with curve at bottom (), also known as Bashkir Dha, is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It was once used in the Bashkir alphabet.

<text>Yi, Ji, or Dotted I with Diaeresis (Ї ї; italics: &quot;Ї ї&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. Yi is derived from the Greek letter iota with diaeresis.

It was the initial variant of the Cyrillic letter Іі, which saw change from two dots to one in 18th century, possibly inspired by similar Latin letter i. Later two variants of the letter separated to become distinct letters in the Ukrainian alphabet.

It is used in the Ukrainian alphabet, the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet, and the Prešov Rusyn alphabet of Slovakia, where it represents the iotated vowel sound , like the pronunciation of in &quot;yeast&quot;. As the historical variant of the Cyrillic Іі it represented either /i/ (as i in &quot;pizza&quot;) or /j/ (as y in &quot;yen&quot;).

In various romanization systems of Ukrainian, &quot;ї&quot; is represented by Latin letters &quot;i&quot; or &quot;yi&quot; (word-initially), &quot;yi&quot;, &quot;ji&quot;, or even &quot;ï&quot;.

It was formerly also used in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet in the late 1700s and early 1800s, where it represented the sound ; in this capacity, it was introduced by Dositej Obradović but eventually replaced with the modern letter ј by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić.

In Ukrainian, the letter was introduced as part of the &quot;Zhelekhivka&quot; orthography, in Yevhen Zhelekhivsky&#x27;s Ukrainian–German dictionary (2 volumes, 1885–86).

<text>Je (Ј ј; italics: &quot;Ј ј&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script, taken over from the Latin letter J.

It commonly represents the palatal approximant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;hallelujah&quot;.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter ј was introduced in the 1818 Serbian dictionary of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, on the basis of the Latin letter J. Karadžić had previously used ї instead for the same sound, a usage he took from Dositej Obradović, and the final choice also notably edged out another expected candidate, й, used in every other standard Slavic-language Cyrillic script.

==Usage==
An asterisk (*) means the language does not use the letter in its orthography anymore.

<doc id="1179938" wikidata="Q5338455" url="?curid=1179938" title="Edisto River">
<text>The Edisto River is one of the longest free-flowing blackwater rivers in North America, flowing over 250 meandering miles from its sources in Saluda and Edgefield counties, to its Atlantic Ocean mouth at Edisto Beach, South Carolina. It rises in two main tributaries (North Fork &amp; South Fork) from springs under the Sandhills region of West Central South Carolina, just to the south of the Piedmont Fall Line. It is the longest and largest river system completely contained within the borders of South Carolina. Its name comes from the Edisto subtribe of the Cusabo Indians.

Near the coast, part of the river was once known as the Ponpon River. The Dawhoo River (sometimes Dawho, or Dawhoe) connects the Edisto to the North Edisto River, also the confluence of the Wadmalaw and the Toogoodoo rivers, where they meet the Atlantic Ocean. Between the coast and the Dawhoo River, the river is known as the South Edisto River.

The Edisto system flows through only one major town or city, Orangeburg, the location of Edisto Gardens (on the North Fork). The river system, being blackwater throughout its entire length, flows through highly intermittent bottom swampland. During an excessively rainy season, the river will leave its main channel, with its flow basin increasing to over a mile or more of total width. The lower Edisto basin forms a crucial part of the ACE Basin, an area that encompasses its bottomlands confluence with the Ashepoo and Combahee river basins.

A major tributary is Four Holes Swamp, which is unique in that it has no single defined channel, but rather a network of braided channels.

==Conservation==

===Wildlife===
Common fish by biomass in the freshwater portions of the Edisto include spotted sucker (&quot;Minytrema melanops&quot;), bowfin (&quot;Amia calva&quot;), flat bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus platycephalus&quot;), largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), longnose gar (&quot;Lepisosteus osseus&quot;), and American eel (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;). Redbreast sunfish (&quot;Lepomis auritus&quot;) is the species most prized by anglers.

===Edisto Riverkeeper===
The Edisto Riverkeeper is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization working to ensure equal access to drinkable, fishable, and swimmable water in the Edisto River basin and its surrounding aquifers and tributaries. As one of over 330 members of the Waterkeeper Alliance, Edisto Riverkeeper seeks to encourage balanced usage of the basin&#x27;s water resources for residents, industry, and municipalities to utilize and enjoy through education, advocacy, and accountability.

===Friends of the Edisto===
Friends of the Edisto, Inc. FRED, a non-profit organization, was established in 1998 to facilitate conservation of natural resources and to encourage and support sustainable economic development within the Edisto River Basin in South Carolina

===Edisto River Canoe and Kayak Trail===
Edisto River Canoe and Kayak Trail &quot;ERCK&quot; is a group of volunteers committed to the preservation of the Edisto River, educating people on safe paddling, and emphasizing the enjoyment of paddling. All instructors are American Canoe Association certified.

==History==

In late August and early September 1718 pirate captains Charles Yeats and Charles Vane were anchored off Sullivan&#x27;s Island, capturing ships as they left Charles Town harbor. After a number of disagreements Yeats fled from Vane, sailing up the Edisto River for shelter; Vane tried to pursue him but broke off. Yeats was ultimately pardoned:

:&quot;...for Yeats having often attempted to quit this Course of Life, took an Opportunity in the Night, to leave Vane and to run into North-Edisto River, to the Southward of Charles-Town, and surrendered to his Majesty’s Pardon.&quot;

<text>Dzhe (Џ џ; italics: &quot;Џ џ&quot; or Џ џ; italics: &quot;Џ, џ&quot;), also spelled dže, is a letter of the Cyrillic script used in Macedonian and varieties of Serbo-Croatian (Montenegrin and Serbian) to represent the voiced postalveolar affricate , like the pronunciation of j in “jump”.

Dzhe corresponds in other Cyrillic alphabets to the digraphs дж or чж, or to the letters Che with descender (Ҷ ҷ), Che with vertical stroke (Ҹ ҹ), Khakassian Che (Ӌ ӌ), Zhe with breve (Ӂ ӂ), Zhe with diaeresis (Ӝ ӝ), or Zhje (Җ җ).

In the Latin version of Serbo-Croatian, it corresponds with the digraph which, like the digraphs and , is treated as a single letter, including in crossword puzzles and for purposes of collation.

Abkhaz uses it to represent the voiced retroflex affricate . The digraph џь is used to represent the sound.

==History==
The letter Dzhe was first used in the 15th-century Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, as a modified form of the letter ч. Serbian scribes began using it in the 17th century. Vuk Karadžić included it in his Cyrillic script reform, when the letter entered widespread use.

<doc id="1179940" wikidata="Q180356" url="?curid=1179940" title="Broadway, Worcestershire">
<text>Broadway is a large village and civil parish in the Cotswolds, England, with a population of 2,540 at the 2011 census. It is in the far southeast of Worcestershire, close to the Gloucestershire border, midway between Evesham and Moreton-in-Marsh.
It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Jewel of the Cotswolds&quot;.

Broadway village lies beneath Fish Hill on the western Cotswold escarpment. The &quot;broad way&quot; is the wide grass-fringed main street, centred on the Green, which is lined with red chestnut trees and honey-coloured Cotswold limestone buildings, many dating from the 16th century. It is known for its association with the Arts and Crafts movement, and is in an area of outstanding scenery and conservation. The wide High Street is lined with a wide variety of shops and cafes, many housed in listed buildings. The village also featured in the 2018 video game &quot;Forza Horizon 4&quot;.

==History==

Broadway is an ancient settlement whose origins are uncertain. There is documentary evidence of activity in the area as far back as Mesolithic times. In 2004, the Council for British Archaeology&#x27;s Worcestershire Young Archaeologists&#x27; Club found evidence of early occupation. Their fieldwork uncovered a large amount of Roman and medieval domestic waste and, most importantly, a large amount of worked Mesolithic flints, raising the possibility that the site might have been a stopping point for hunter-gatherers. This work makes the known history of the village to be over 5,000 years and so may be evidence of one of the first partially settled sites in the United Kingdom. Broadway has also seen the settlement of the ancient Beaker people (1900 BCE), and later, the Roman occupation. It gained the name &quot;Bradsetena Gamere&quot; (Broad Village) around the 9th century and underwent a number of changes until the modern spelling &#x27;Broadway&#x27; became common usage in the 16th century.

Broadway was a domain of the Mercian kings and was vested in the Crown in the person of King Edgar in 967. The first existing documentary evidence of importance is embodied in a charter that King Edgar granted to the Benedictine Monastery of Pershore in 972. In this Anglo-Saxon text, Broadway is called &quot;Bradanwege&quot; and its boundaries are described in great detail. The complete copy of the charter may be seen in the British Museum (Facsimile Volume III 30).

By the 11th century the village was already well established and apparently thriving. It is listed in the Domesday Book in Great Domesday folio 175 for Worcestershire as part of the land holdings of the Church of St Mary of Pershore: &quot;The church itself holds &quot;Bradeweia&quot;. There are 30 hides paying geld. In demesne are 3 ploughs; and a priest and 42 villeins with 20 ploughs. There are 8 slaves. The whole in the time of Edward was worth £12 10s 0d; now £14 10s 0d.&quot;

It continued to prosper, becoming a borough by the 13th century. For Broadway this marked a considerable departure from the entirely peasant community that had existed in former times, though the following two centuries saw it decline in the wake of the Black Death. Its fortunes were revived during the late 16th century after the dissolution of the monasteries relieved Pershore Abbey of ownership in 1539. The Crown sold the Manor of Broadway in 1558. There followed three centuries of almost unbroken growth, during which the population increased to about five times its Elizabethan level. As in other Cotswold towns, wealth was based on the wool and cloth trade. In the first half the 19th century Broadway was part of a short-lived Cotswolds silk industry, centred on Blockley, with a water-powered silk mill.

By around 1600 the village had become a busy stagecoach stop on the route from Worcester to London. The village provided all the services that might be needed, including grooms, places of refreshment and extra horses for the steep haul up Fish Hill. As a result, there were once as many as 33 public houses in Broadway compared to the three which exist today.

The road between Evesham and the summit of Fish Hill became a toll road as a result of legislation dated 1728. Tolls were collected at Turnpike House, which can be found (now renamed Pike Cottage) in the Upper High Street. However, the introduction of the railways in Britain in the mid-19th century reduced the passing trade on which Broadway relied. Travel by stagecoach stopped almost immediately with the opening of the railway in Evesham in 1852.

Stripped of its role of staging post, Broadway became a backwater; a haven of peace and tranquillity. Victorian artists and writers were drawn to the village&#x27;s calm and the famous Arts and Crafts movement made its home in the area. The artists and writers to whom Broadway became home included Edwin Austin Abbey, Mary Anderson, J. M. Barrie, Arthur Blomfield, Elgar, Francis Davis Millet, William Morris, John Singer Sargent and Vaughan Williams.

Blomfield lived at Springfield House and is buried in Broadway.

Millet died in the sinking of the Titanic aged 65 and is commemorated by a memorial at St Eadburgha&#x27;s Churchyard, Broadway. In 1932 Millet&#x27;s son Jack donated £120 to St Eadburgha&#x27;s Church for the construction of lychgates in his father&#x27;s memory at the churchyard on Snowshill Road.

Broadway is thought (by Sir Steven Runciman (1903–2000), a Cambridge historian who knew Benson well) to have been the model for a fictional Elizabethan village in the Cotswolds, Riseholme, the home of Lucia in the novels of E. F. Benson, before she moved to Tilling (based on Rye in East Sussex).

The arrival of the motor-car at the turn of the 20th century, and the advent of popular tourism, restored Broadway&#x27;s vitality, placing it now among the most frequently visited of all Cotswold villages. In 1934 J. B. Priestley published his book &quot;English Journey&quot;, a travelogue in which he re-visits areas of the Cotswolds, including Broadway. He described the Cotswolds as &quot;the most English and the least spoiled of all our countrysides. The truth is that it has no colour that can be described. Even when the sun is obscured and the light is cold, these walls are still faintly warm and luminous, as if they knew the trick of keeping the lost sunlight of centuries glimmering about them.&quot;
The war memorial on the village green, dating from 1920, marks the deaths of local individuals who died fighting in World War I and World War II.

Broadway takes its name from the wide main street, now High Street (one of the longest in England). By the 18th century, it was a toll road and a prominent stagecoach stop. In the beginning the ‘broad way’ probably began as a drove road and may be unusually wide because of the two small streams that used to run each side of the main street; people built on either side of the brooks, and a road formed down the middle. In the winter, the mud from the road was piled up, and in the summer, grass grew on the piles; these verges still remain today. Water used to flow down from the hills and straight through the village then in later years the streams were mostly hidden inside underground pipes, only emerging at occasional ‘dipping’ points. Nowadays, the streams are almost entirely invisible.

==Modern times==

Today, Broadway is a centre for arts and antiques. The village&#x27;s accommodation includes the Broadway Hotel, Russell&#x27;s &quot;a restaurant with rooms&quot;, the 1600s Cotswold inn the Lygon Arms, a caravan site, holiday cottages, bed and breakfast lodges, old pubs including the Swan Inn and Crown &amp; Trumpet, shops, restaurants and tea rooms.

Local attractions include the Gordon Russell Design Museum (celebrating the work of the 20th-century furniture maker Sir Gordon Russell MC), the Ashmolean Museum Broadway displaying objects from the 17th to the 21st centuries in &#x27;Tudor House&#x27; a former 17th-century coaching inn, the Broadway Tower on its hilltop site in the Broadway Tower Country Park, Chipping Campden, Snowshill village, Snowshill Manor (owned by the National Trust), horse riding and, for the many ramblers, the Cotswold Way.

&quot;Country Life&quot; magazine provided these insights into the importance of the Russell museum. &quot;In 1903 &quot;Sydney Bolton Russell [Gordon&#x27;s father] bought the inn on the main street, The Lygon Arms, restoring it ... Originally a craftsman in the Arts-and-Crafts mould (although he was later frowned-upon by purists for his willingness to increase output by using machines), Gordon Russell opened a workshop in the village.&quot;

The village is overlooked by Broadway Hill, the highest point in the northern Cotswolds at above sea level, which is popular with hill walkers.

==Churches==
The original parish church of Broadway actually lies almost a mile outside of the village. Nevertheless, the Church of St Eadburgha has been a Christian place of worship since the 12th century and continues to be a significant aspect of village life. The dedication of a Christian church to Eadburgha is not common. Eadburgha was the granddaughter of Alfred the Great. The story is told that as a child Eadburgha was asked to choose between receiving jewels or her own Bible, she chose the Bible.

The Church of St Eadburgha is listed as Grade I by English Heritage (Building ID: 400976). The current structure was built but there are elements that remain of the original 12th-century building.

The main Broadway parish church is now St. Michael and All Angels, which is listed as Grade II. It was built in 1839 within the village of Broadway itself. It has a fine wood carved pulpit transferred from St Eadburgha.

The Roman Catholic place of worship is St Saviour&#x27;s which is listed as Grade II (since 2016). The building was constructed as a Benedictine monastery chapel in 1828–1829; it was extended and altered in the 1850s when a school was added, and the interior was modified slightly several times afterwards. The property was converted to a parish church in 2000. The individual primarily responsible for the original development of this facility was Dom John Augustine Birdsall OSB.

==Broadway railway station==

Broadway was once served by a railway line, a relative latecomer in British railway history, opened in 1904 by the Great Western Railway and running from Stratford-upon-Avon to Cheltenham, part of a main line from Birmingham to the South West and South Wales. Broadway railway station along with almost all others on this section closed in 1960; though passenger services continued until 1968, and goods continued until 1976 when a derailment south of Toddington damaged the line. It was decided not to bring the section back into use and by the early 1980s, it had been dismantled.

Thus, although Broadway has a railway station site and a Station Road, it is no longer served by National Rail services. The nearest railway stations are Evesham, Honeybourne and Moreton-in-Marsh, on the main line train service running between Hereford and London Paddington station and on the Cotswold Line between Oxford and Worcester.

===Heritage railways===
The 15-mile stretch between Broadway Station and Cheltenham Racecourse has since been reconstructed and reopened as the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.

The line was extended northwards to the village, and Broadway is its current northern terminus, opening in 2018. Though nothing remained of the original Broadway railway station, the Broadway Area Group of the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway Trust received planning permission to reconstruct the station. Work started in 2009, rebuilding the platforms, signal box, railway station buildings and footbridge.

The Trust completed the laying of tracks on 23 December 2017, with a test train arriving at Broadway later the same day, and had passenger services running from 30 March 2018.

In addition, the now disbanded Stratford upon Avon and Broadway Railway Society aimed to re-open the northern part of the line from Broadway to Stratford-upon-Avon. This was a long-term project and, initially, the society concentrated on the short stretch from Honeybourne to Long Marston.

Nonetheless, reaching Stratford-upon-Avon (via Honeybourne) remains the GWR Trust&#x27;s main dream and official goal for the future, although no longer easily achievable, owing to a road obstruction between Stratford-upon-Avon Racecourse and the station itself.

<text>In machine learning, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for several reasons:

* simplification of models to make them easier to interpret,
* shorter training times,
* to avoid the curse of dimensionality,
* improve the compatibility of the data with a certain learning model class,
* to encode inherent symmetries present in the input space.

The central premise when using feature selection is that data sometimes contains features that are &quot;redundant&quot; or &quot;irrelevant&quot;, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information. Redundancy and irrelevance are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated.

Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection finds a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples (data points).

==Introduction==
A feature selection algorithm can be seen as the combination of a search technique for proposing new feature subsets, along with an evaluation measure which scores the different feature subsets. The simplest algorithm is to test each possible subset of features finding the one which minimizes the error rate. This is an exhaustive search of the space, and is computationally intractable for all but the smallest of feature sets. The choice of evaluation metric heavily influences the algorithm, and it is these evaluation metrics which distinguish between the three main categories of feature selection algorithms: wrappers, filters and embedded methods.

* Wrapper methods use a predictive model to score feature subsets. Each new subset is used to train a model, which is tested on a hold-out set. Counting the number of mistakes made on that hold-out set (the error rate of the model) gives the score for that subset. As wrapper methods train a new model for each subset, they are very computationally intensive, but usually provide the best performing feature set for that particular type of model or typical problem.
* Filter methods use a proxy measure instead of the error rate to score a feature subset. This measure is chosen to be fast to compute, while still capturing the usefulness of the feature set. Common measures include the mutual information, the pointwise mutual information, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Relief-based algorithms, and inter/intra class distance or the scores of significance tests for each class/feature combinations. Filters are usually less computationally intensive than wrappers, but they produce a feature set which is not tuned to a specific type of predictive model. This lack of tuning means a feature set from a filter is more general than the set from a wrapper, usually giving lower prediction performance than a wrapper. However the feature set doesn&#x27;t contain the assumptions of a prediction model, and so is more useful for exposing the relationships between the features. Many filters provide a feature ranking rather than an explicit best feature subset, and the cut off point in the ranking is chosen via cross-validation. Filter methods have also been used as a preprocessing step for wrapper methods, allowing a wrapper to be used on larger problems. One other popular approach is the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm, commonly used with Support Vector Machines to repeatedly construct a model and remove features with low weights. 
* Embedded methods are a catch-all group of techniques which perform feature selection as part of the model construction process. The exemplar of this approach is the LASSO method for constructing a linear model, which penalizes the regression coefficients with an L1 penalty, shrinking many of them to zero. Any features which have non-zero regression coefficients are &#x27;selected&#x27; by the LASSO algorithm. Improvements to the LASSO include Bolasso which bootstraps samples; Elastic net regularization, which combines the L1 penalty of LASSO with the L2 penalty of ridge regression; and FeaLect which scores all the features based on combinatorial analysis of regression coefficients. AEFS further extends LASSO to nonlinear scenario with autoencoders. These approaches tend to be between filters and wrappers in terms of computational complexity.

In traditional regression analysis, the most popular form of feature selection is stepwise regression, which is a wrapper technique. It is a greedy algorithm that adds the best feature (or deletes the worst feature) at each round. The main control issue is deciding when to stop the algorithm. In machine learning, this is typically done by cross-validation. In statistics, some criteria are optimized. This leads to the inherent problem of nesting. More robust methods have been explored, such as branch and bound and piecewise linear network.

==Subset selection==
Subset selection evaluates a subset of features as a group for suitability. Subset selection algorithms can be broken up into wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. Wrappers use a search algorithm to search through the space of possible features and evaluate each subset by running a model on the subset. Wrappers can be computationally expensive and have a risk of over fitting to the model. Filters are similar to wrappers in the search approach, but instead of evaluating against a model, a simpler filter is evaluated. Embedded techniques are embedded in, and specific to, a model.

Many popular search approaches use greedy hill climbing, which iteratively evaluates a candidate subset of features, then modifies the subset and evaluates if the new subset is an improvement over the old. Evaluation of the subsets requires a scoring metric that grades a subset of features. Exhaustive search is generally impractical, so at some implementor (or operator) defined stopping point, the subset of features with the highest score discovered up to that point is selected as the satisfactory feature subset. The stopping criterion varies by algorithm; possible criteria include: a subset score exceeds a threshold, a program&#x27;s maximum allowed run time has been surpassed, etc.

Alternative search-based techniques are based on targeted projection pursuit which finds low-dimensional projections of the data that score highly: the features that have the largest projections in the lower-dimensional space are then selected.

Search approaches include:

* Exhaustive
* Best first
* Simulated annealing
* Genetic algorithm
* Greedy forward selection
* Greedy backward elimination
* Particle swarm optimization
* Targeted projection pursuit
* Scatter search
* Variable neighborhood search

Two popular filter metrics for classification problems are correlation and mutual information, although neither are true metrics or &#x27;distance measures&#x27; in the mathematical sense, since they fail to obey the triangle inequality and thus do not compute any actual &#x27;distance&#x27; – they should rather be regarded as &#x27;scores&#x27;. These scores are computed between a candidate feature (or set of features) and the desired output category. There are, however, true metrics that are a simple function of the mutual information; see here.

Other available filter metrics include:

* Class separability
** Error probability
** Inter-class distance
** Probabilistic distance
** Entropy
* Consistency-based feature selection
* Correlation-based feature selection

==Optimality criteria==
The choice of optimality criteria is difficult as there are multiple objectives in a feature selection task. Many common criteria incorporate a measure of accuracy, penalised by the number of features selected. Examples include Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Mallows&#x27;s &quot;Cp&quot;, which have a penalty of 2 for each added feature. AIC is based on information theory, and is effectively derived via the maximum entropy principle.

Other criteria are Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which uses a penalty of formula_1 for each added feature, minimum description length (MDL) which asymptotically uses formula_1, Bonferroni / RIC which use formula_3, maximum dependency feature selection, and a variety of new criteria that are motivated by false discovery rate (FDR), which use something close to formula_4. A maximum entropy rate criterion may also be used to select the most relevant subset of features.

==Structure learning==
Filter feature selection is a specific case of a more general paradigm called structure learning. Feature selection finds the relevant feature set for a specific target variable whereas structure learning finds the relationships between all the variables, usually by expressing these relationships as a graph. The most common structure learning algorithms assume the data is generated by a Bayesian Network, and so the structure is a directed graphical model. The optimal solution to the filter feature selection problem is the Markov blanket of the target node, and in a Bayesian Network, there is a unique Markov Blanket for each node.

==Information Theory Based Feature Selection Mechanisms==

There are different Feature Selection mechanisms around that utilize mutual information for scoring the different features. They usually use all the same algorithm:

# Calculate the mutual information as score for between all features (formula_5) and the target class ()
# Select the feature with the largest score (e.g. formula_6) and add it to the set of selected features ()
# Calculate the score which might be derived from the mutual information
# Select the feature with the largest score and add it to the set of select features (e.g. formula_7)
# Repeat 3. and 4. until a certain number of features is selected (e.g. formula_8)

The simplest approach uses the mutual information as the &quot;derived&quot; score.

However, there are different approaches, that try to reduce the redundancy between features.

===Minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR) feature selection===
Peng &quot;et al.&quot; proposed a feature selection method that can use either mutual information, correlation, or distance/similarity scores to select features. The aim is to penalise a feature&#x27;s relevancy by its redundancy in the presence of the other selected features. The relevance of a feature set for the class is defined by the average value of all mutual information values between the individual feature and the class as follows:

:formula_9.

The redundancy of all features in the set is the average value of all mutual information values between the feature and the feature :

:&lt;math&gt; R(S) = \frac{1}

==Feature selection embedded in learning algorithms==
Some learning algorithms perform feature selection as part of their overall operation. These include:

* -regularization techniques, such as sparse regression, LASSO, and -SVM
* Regularized trees, e.g. regularized random forest implemented in the RRF package
* Decision tree
* Memetic algorithm
* Random multinomial logit (RMNL)
* Auto-encoding networks with a bottleneck-layer
* Submodular feature selection
* Local learning based feature selection. Compared with traditional methods, it does not involve any heuristic search, can easily handle multi-class problems, and works for both linear and nonlinear problems. It is also supported by a strong theoretical foundation. Numeric experiments showed that the method can achieve a close-to-optimal solution even when data contains &gt;1M irrelevant features.
* Recommender system based on feature selection. The feature selection methods are introduced into recommender system research.

<doc id="1179960" wikidata="Q1861708" url="?curid=1179960" title="Scotism">
<text>Scotism is the philosophical school and theological system named after John Duns Scotus, a 13th-century Scottish philosopher-theologian. The word comes from the name of its originator, whose &quot;Opus Oxoniense&quot; was one of the most important documents in medieval philosophy and Roman Catholic theology, defining what would later be declared the dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in his constitution &quot;Ineffabilis Deus&quot; on 8 December 1854.

==Development==
Scotism developed out of the Old Franciscan School, which dominated theology during the Middle Ages. This school of thought initially followed Augustinism, which dominated theology at the time.

Scotus found the ground already cleared for the conflict with the followers of Aquinas. He made very free use of Aristotelianism, but in its employment exercised sharp criticism, and in important points adhered to the teaching of the Older Franciscan School–especially with regard to the plurality of forms or of souls, the spiritual matter of the angels and of souls, etc., wherein he energetically combatted Aquinas. Scotism, or what is known as the Later Franciscan School, is thus only a continuation or further development of the older school, with a much wider, although not exclusive acceptance of Peripatetic ideas. The difference between Thomism and Scotism could be expressed by saying that, while both derive from Arabic Neoplatonized Aristotelianism, Thomism is closer to the orthodox Aristotelianism of Maimonides, Averroes and Avicenna, while Scotism reflects the Platonizing tendency going back through Avicebron, the Brethren of Purity, the Liber de Causis and Proclus to Plotinus.

Concerning the relation of these schools to each other, or the relation of Scotus to Alexander of Hales and St. Bonaventure, consult the work of the Flemish Recollect, Mathias Hauzeur. While Thomism has received unparalleled backing by the Magisterium, Scotist influence prevailed on a number of important points, not least the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.

== Doctrinal conflicts within the Catholic Church ==
Nominalism is older than Scotus, but its revival in Occamism may be traced to the one-sided exaggeration of some propositions of Scotus. Scotist Formalism is the direct opposite of Nominalism, and the Scotists were at one with the Thomists in combatting the latter; Occam himself was a bitter opponent of Scotus. The Council of Trent defined as dogma a series of doctrines especially emphasized by the Scotists (e.g. freedom of the will, free co-operation with grace, etc..). In other points the canons were intentionally so framed that they do not affect Scotism (e.g. that the first man was constitutus in holiness and justice). This was also done at the Vatican Council. In the Thomistic–Molinistic controversy concerning the foreknowledge of God, predestination, the relation of grace to free will, the Scotists took little part. They either supported one of the parties, or took up a middle position, rejecting both the predetermination of the Thomists and the scientia media of the Molinists. In Scotism, God recognizes the free future acts in His essence, and provides a free decree of His will, which does not predetermine human free will, but only accompanies it.

== Jesuit tradition ==
Jesuit philosophers and theologians adopted a series of the Scotist propositions. Later authorities reject in part many of these propositions, and another series of propositions was rejected by Catholic theologians based on a misunderstanding – e.g. the doctrine of the &quot;univocatio entis&quot;, of the acceptation of the merits of Christ and man, etc.

Numerous other propositions have been accepted or at least favourably treated by a large number of Catholic scholars and amongst these are many propositions from psychology: e.g. that the powers of the soul are not merely accidents even natural and necessary of the soul, that they are not really distinct from the substance of the soul or from one another etc.

They also took from Scotism many propositions concerning the doctrine of the angels.

== Influence on philosophy and theology ==

Scotism exercised an influence on the development of philosophy and theology; its importance is not, as is often asserted, purely negative – i.e. it does not consist only in the fact that it exercised a criticism on Thomas Aquinas and the Thomistic school.

A comparison of the Scotist teaching with that of Aquinas has been often attempted – for example, in the abovementioned work of Hauzeur at the end of the first volume; by Sarnano (Costanzo Torri, &quot;Conciliatio omnium controversiarum etc.&quot; (1589– ). In many cases, the differences are mostly in the terminology and a reconciliation is possible if one emphasize certain parts of Scotus or Aquinas and passes over or tones down others. However, some contradictions remain on a number of points.

Generally speaking, Scotism found its supporters within the Franciscan Order; certainly, opposition to the Dominicans (i.e. to Aquinas) made many members of the order disciples of Scotus. However, this does not mean that the foundation and development of Scotism is to be regarded as a product of the rivalry between the two orders. Even Aquinas at first found a few opponents in his order – not all his fellow-Dominicans followed him in every particular (e.g. Durandus of St. Pourçain).

The Scotist doctrines were also supported by many Minorites. Furthermore, Scotism found not a few supporters among secular professors and in other religious orders (e.g. the Augustinians, Servites, etc.), especially in England, Ireland, and Spain. Of the Minorites who supported Scotist doctrine, the Conventuals seem to have adhered most faithfully to Scotus, particularly at the University of Padua, where many highly esteemed teachers lectured.

== Emergence of the Scotist School ==
It is only at the end of the 15th or the beginning of the 16th century that a special Scotist School can be spoken of. Scotus&#x27;s works were then collected, brought out in many editions and commentated, etc. Regulations of general chapters, beginning in 1501, frequently recommend or directly prescre Scotism as the teaching of the order.

Scotism appears to have attained its greatest popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Special Scotist chairs appear during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in locations including Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcalá, Padua, and Pavia. In the eighteenth century it had still an important following, but in the 19th it suffered a great decline. One of the reasons for this was the repeated suppressions of the order in almost every country, while the recommendation of the teaching of St. Thomas by several popes could not be favourable to Scotism.

Some sources describe Scotism as merely tolerated by the Catholic Church. The Catholic Encyclopedia disputes this, arguing that none of its propositions have been censured, many prominent Catholic figures have been adherents, and various general statues recommend it. In their decrees Leo XIII and Pius X have recommended not alone St. Thomas, but also Scholasticism in general, and this includes also the Scotist School. 

==Scotists==
Most Scotists are both philosophers and theologians. Notable Scotists of the fourteenth century included Antonius Andrea and Francis of Mayrone (c. 1280–1328) author of a &quot;Tractatus de transcendentibus&quot;. Francis Mayron, who introduced the &quot;actus sorbonicus&quot; into the University of Paris.

===15th and 16th centuries===
Scotists of the fifteenth century included two popes, Alexander V and Sixtus IV, Elector Frederick III of Saxony and Angelus of Chivasso. The latter&#x27;s work on Scotist theology was so notorious that it was publicly burned by Martin Luther.

Notable Scotists of the sixteenth century included Paul Scriptoris, noted professor at the University of Tübingen, and the Archbishop of Athens Antonio Trombetta.

===17th and 18th centuries===

The many Scotists of the 17th and 18th centuries include:

*Angelo Vulpes (Volpe) (d. 1647) wrote &quot;Summa&quot; and &quot;Commen. theologiae Scoti&quot; in twelve folio volumes.
*Luke Wadding (d. 1657), a well-known annalist, edited with other Irishmen in the College of S. Isidore at Rome the complete works of Scotus (12 vols., Lyons, 1639).
*Lambertus Lambrecht (about 1696), named the Viennese Scotus.
*Cardinal Lorenzo Brancati di Lauria (d. 1693), held in high favour by several popes.
*Francisco Macedo (d. 1681), a Portuguese, professor at Padua is said to have composed over one hundred writings and was renowned for his public disputations.
*Claude Frassen (d. 1711) was for thirty years a celebrated professor at the Sorbonne and wrote &quot;Scotus academicus seu universa theo Scoti&quot;.
*Bartholomaeus Durandus (Bartélemy Durand) (d. 1720) wrote the great &quot;Clypeus Scotisticae Theologiae&quot;.

===19th century===

In the nineteenth century, although Scotism was retained in the schools of the Franciscan Order in accordance with the statutes, there were few works in the Scotist tradition, in any case no celebrated ones.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Though the use of the term Scotism has become a bit antiquated, several contemporary theologians, especially from among the Franciscan Orders, like Kenan Osborne OFM and Daniel Horan OFM, can be seen as in the Scotist tradition. Several recent projects such as the Scotus Project of CUA, the International Scotistic Commission in Rome and the Commission of the Franciscan Intellectual Tradition of the English Speaking Conference of the OFM have sought to increase awareness of Duns Scotus and Scotism on contemporary theology. Scotism has also found a home amongst Anglo-Catholics, including Richard Cross and Thomas Williams, as well as influencing Protestants like William Lane Craig.

<doc id="1179965" wikidata="Q1617714" url="?curid=1179965" title="Quill (band)">
<text>Quill was a rock band that played extensively throughout New England, New York, and the mid-Atlantic states in the late 1960s, and gained national attention by performing at the original Woodstock Festival in 1969. The band was founded by two singer-songwriters and brothers from the Boston area, Jon and Dan Cole.
==Early days==
The basic line up included Roger North on drums, Norm Rogers on guitar and Phil Thayer on keyboard, saxophone, and flute, with Jon on bass and Dan doing the bulk of the lead vocals. However, as explained in detail below, instrumental flexibility was one of the band&#x27;s most unusual features. Out of this combination, and with the Cole brothers&#x27; focus on original songwriting came &#x27;Quill&#x27;, which was then signed as a group to Amphion Management. The band spent 1967, 1968 and 1969 regularly playing rock venues in Boston, Providence, and New York, as well as many other smaller markets around the Northeast. Though Quill rarely played outside their region, the show made it as far west as Aspen, Colorado.

==Success==
Quill opened for The Jeff Beck Group, The Who, The Kinks, Deep Purple, Buddy Guy, Blue Cheer, Sly and the Family Stone, Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, and the comedian Steve Martin.. An appearance in the early summer of 1969 at Steve Paul&#x27;s Scene in New York City resulted in Quill being invited to play at the Woodstock Festival. That night at the club also featured the first introduction of Johnny Winter to the NYC record industry crowd.

Aside from the basic roles of each member of the band, the band was able to mount a variety of instrumental and vocal configurations to play specific songs. Roger North anchored the band on the drums and percussion. The other members of the band would often switch instruments to create different sounds and effects. Jon and Norm both sang some lead vocals while Dan might be playing guitar or trombone, forming a small horn section with Phil on sax; Jon would sometimes switch to guitar with Norm playing bass; Norm was known to trot out his cello on occasion; Phil even played bass while Norm and Dan played guitar and Jon sang; everyone participated in group vocals as needed. Though Dan was the primary frontman for the band on stage, its ability to effectively and frequently change focal points and configurations was well-suited to the broad songwriting ambitions of the Coles, who were responsible for almost all of the band&#x27;s material.

Quill&#x27;s music was eclectic, social commentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes ironic, merged with very unusual, at times nearly atonal scales. The Cole brothers were hoping to make their audiences think, even while the music was being enjoyed. A local reviewer likened the band&#x27;s music to a modern-day &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;.

In addition to its original material, Quill made its reputation on performance art by drawing the audience into the music. The band handed out rhythm instruments and exhorted the crowds to a near riotous dance frenzy.

==Woodstock==

At Woodstock, in addition to playing the main festival stage on Saturday, Quill spent the week preceding the festival living at the setup crew&#x27;s camp at a nearby motel, providing entertainment for the stage crew, hog farmers and festival workers. Quill was also hired by festival promoters to play a series of goodwill concerts at nearby state prisons, mental institutions and halfway houses as a gesture to assuage community concerns about the upcoming festival. 

Seeing the market potential of the buzz that the band had already created, and with the band&#x27;s upcoming appearance at Woodstock, Ahmet Ertegün (president of Atlantic Records) agreed to sign Quill in the summer of 1969 to the Cotillion label.

At the festival, after relentless, torrential rain all Friday and through the night, the skies cleared just before the band was to play. On a still-soaking stage, but under a beaming sun, the band played a 40-minute set of four songs (&quot;They Live the Life&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s How I Eat&quot;, &quot;Driftin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Waiting For You&quot;) and was received enthusiastically by the 400,000-person throng. Because the band appeared first on Saturday, and with the disarray caused by the rain, Quill missed a key opportunity to appear in the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film, though this was the original intent of Paret and the band. The band had indeed been filmed, but a glitch caused the audio and film to not be synchronized properly. This rendered the footage unusable for the now-famous film that made so many acts into household names. The problem was fixed in time for Santana, the next band up, whose appearance in the film sealed their later success.

Shortly after the festival, Quill self-produced and then released its first Cotillion album, which made some impact but did not gain national attention. The fact that the Quill footage could not be used for the Woodstock movie seriously disappointed Ertegün, and the band&#x27;s record was never actively promoted, even though over the years it has attained some cult status.

==After Woodstock==
Jon Cole, who was one of the driving creative forces in the band, left several months after the album release to pursue other production projects in which he had an interest. With the assistance of New York producer Tony Bongiovi, the other four members composed enough material to produce and record a second album for Cotillion, but which the label chose not to release. The remaining four disbanded Quill late in the spring of 1970.

Jon Cole spent a couple of years more in the music world, associated with Andy Pratt (known for his hit &quot;Avenging Annie&quot;) and Jimmy Thompson, a popular singer-songwriter/guitarist from Boston. He went on to form Mechania, a groundbreaking company focused on teaching customers how to fix their own cars, and later moved to Hawaii where he became an expert in off-grid power alternatives. Cole now heads a company, Light on the Earth Systems, devoted to the spread and worldwide adoption of solar power.

Dan Cole later ran Intermedia Sound Studios, Boston&#x27;s first 16-track recording studio. He also produced many local acts and multimedia soundtracks, including that of the first US laser light show, Lovelight, which had a long, successful run at Boston&#x27;s Hayden Planetarium. He started his own production company, Dan Cole Productions, which managed and produced several music acts from the Boston area, including The American Standard Band (ASB), The Johnson Brothers and Jon Butcher. Cole arranged, through Michael Lang, then Joe Cocker&#x27;s manager, for ASB to become Joe&#x27;s band for a series of international tours and one album. He signed an independent production agreement with Island Records to produce ASB, who recorded two records with Island. Maurice Johnson later became the manager and producer of New Kids on the Block. Jon Butcher became known for his unique guitar, vocal and songwriting style, with several moderate hits. In the early 1980s, Dan Cole left the music business to pursue a career in the high-tech production hardware/software business, spending 12 years with Sony Professional Products Group. He left the corporate world to become a private investor and management consultant, and he still writes and produces his own material in his digital studio and is currently working on an album for general release.

After Quill disbanded, Roger North had a run as the drummer for the popular folk artist Odetta, and then ended up joining the post-&quot;Easy Rider&quot; version of Holy Modal Rounders, moving to Oregon with Steve Weber and the rest of the band (save Peter Stampfel, who remained in New York). He continued to perform with the HMR well into the 1980s, although he missed the opportunity to record with the band on what may be one of their best remembered efforts, &quot;Have Moicy!&quot;, a 1975 collaboration with Michael Hurley and Jeffrey Fredrick and the Clamtones. Roger went on to design the unique North Drums, still favored by some drummers lucky enough to have purchased a kit. He currently lives in Portland, Oregon and plays in the Freak Mountain Ramblers.

<text>Aragon is a census-designated place on the Tularosa River in Catron County, New Mexico, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 94. It is located northeast of Apache Creek.

==History==

===Old Fort Tularosa===

Aragon is on the site of former Old Fort Tularosa , which was built in 1872 to protect the Apache Indian Agency from the Ojo Caliente Band of Apaches. The fort was abandoned when the tribe was moved back to the Ojo Caliente reservation in 1874. A stockade was built on the site of the earlier fort in 1880 by Buffalo Soldiers led by Sergeant George Jordan. Jordan eventually received the Medal of Honor for leading 25 men to repulse a force of more than 100 Indians in the Battle of Fort Tularosa.

The only remaining evidence of the fort is a burial ground for soldiers who served in the Arizona Territory.

===The town===
The town was known as &quot;Joseph&quot; from 1887 to 1898 and 1901 to 1906. Since 1906 it has been known as &quot;Aragon&quot;, named for an old Spanish family who still lives in the area. Near Aragon, on the north side of Tularosa Canyon, a cave was occupied from 400 B.C. to A.D. 1100, containing pits and later masonry rooms.

<doc id="1179973" wikidata="Q2943836" url="?curid=1179973" title="Bilingual belt">
<text>The bilingual belt (French: &quot;la ceinture bilingue&quot;) is a term for the portion of Canada where both French and English are regularly spoken. 
The term was coined by Richard Joy in his 1967 book &quot;Languages in Conflict&quot;, where he wrote, &quot;The language boundaries in Canada are hardening, with the consequent elimination of minorities everywhere except within a relatively narrow bilingual belt.&quot;

Joy&#x27;s analysis of the 1961 census caused him to conclude:

==Overview==
The bilingual belt is the frontier zone on either side of what Joy referred to as &quot;Interior Quebec&quot;—the heartland of the French language in North America, in which, in the 1961 census, over 95% of the population gave French as their mother tongue and 2% speak only English. The bilingual belt is, therefore, the &quot;region of contact&quot; between the Quebec heartland in which French is the overwhelmingly predominant language and the rest of Canada, in which English is the overwhelmingly predominant language.

When the bilingual belt is added to the French language heartland of &quot;Interior Quebec&quot;, the result is:

Joy recognized the continued (although diminished) existence of residual French-speaking communities in places like Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Saint Boniface, Manitoba, but these communities were isolated and very small, and were, in his view, already well on the way to extinction, along with most of the smaller pockets of English-speakers within Quebec. For example, he had this to say about the French language in Manitoba: &quot;The Franco-Manitobans have resisted assimilation more effectively than have the minorities in the other Western Provinces, but the 1961 Census reported only 6,341 children of French mother tongue, as against 12,337 of French origin. This could well indicate that the actual numbers, and not merely the relative strength, of those who retain the old language will soon start to fall.&quot;

==Regions within the bilingual belt==
Strictly speaking, the bilingual belt has never been a single contiguous region. Instead, the parts of the bilingual belt lying within Ontario and west Quebec form one geographical unit, and the part in northern New Brunswick formed a separate geographical unit. Joy also noted that there was considerable demographic variation within the bilingual belt itself, based on such factors as proximity to the unilingual French-speaking heartland of &quot;Interior Quebec&quot; and the ratio in any particular part of the bilingual belt of native French-speakers to native English-speakers. He summarized these regional divisions as follows:

; In New Brunswick: In seven counties in the province&#x27;s north and north-east, French was the mother tongue of 59% of the population. Joy indicated that in this region, rates of bilingualism were high among francophones but that French &quot;is spoken by practically none&quot; of the Anglophones in this part of the bilingual belt.
; In Quebec: Joy pointed to a strip of territory running from the Eastern Townships westward through Montreal to Pontiac County. In this region, French was the mother tongue of 70% of the population, and English of the remaining 30%. The rates of bilingualism were 40% for persons with French as their mother tongue, and &quot;less than a third&quot; for persons with English as their mother tongue.
; In Ontario: This part of the bilingual belt consisted of &quot;the eleven counties which form a band, along the Quebec border, running from the St. Lawrence River to the Upper Lakes&quot;. Joy reported that in this region, French was the mother tongue of 30% of the population, and that fewer than one quarter of persons of French descent had been assimilated.

==Demographic trends in more recent years==

Demographic data from more recent censuses indicate that the geographic extent of the bilingual belt has remained largely unchanged in the nearly half century since the 1961 census, although assimilation and migration patterns have caused some population characteristics to change over time. Most notably, rates of bilingualism among the English-mother tongue population in the Quebec part of the bilingual belt are now far higher than they were in 1961.

Based on the 2011 census data, 85.7% of Canadians with knowledge of both official languages live within Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick, the three provinces which comprise Canada&#x27;s bilingual belt. Only 14% of Canadians with knowledge of both official languages live outside of those three provinces.

The bilingual belt also contains the high proportion of individuals who are incapable of speaking the official language of the province. For example, in Quebec, approximately 5% of Quebecers (or 1% of Canadians overall) reported that they can only speak English.

<doc id="1179978" wikidata="Q463200" url="?curid=1179978" title="Steve Smith (basketball)">
<text>Steven Delano Smith (born March 31, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player who is a basketball analyst for Turner Sports. After a collegiate career with Michigan State, he played with several teams in his 14-season National Basketball Association career, including the Miami Heat, the Portland Trail Blazers and the San Antonio Spurs, but is perhaps best known for his five-year stint with the Atlanta Hawks which included an All-Star Game appearance in 1998. He won a championship with the Spurs in 2003.
Smith was widely regarded as an excellent three-point shooter, and is one of three players to make seven 3-pointers in a quarter.

He joined the USA men&#x27;s national basketball team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship winning the gold medal. He won another gold medal at the 1999 Tournament of the Americas and an Olympic gold medal with the USA men&#x27;s national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics with eleven other NBA All-Stars.

==College career==
Smith finished his four-year career as the all-time leading scorer in Michigan State history, with 2,263 points. He ranks fourth on the school&#x27;s all-time assists list (with 453) and fifth in rebounds (with 704). For his college career Smith averaged 18.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists per contest in 122 games. He was named to the NABC All-American First Team as a senior. Smith led the Spartans to a Big Ten Championship and Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1990 and hit a game-winning, last-second three-pointer to beat Wisconsin–Green Bay in the first round of the 1991 NCAA Tournament. He was inducted into Michigan State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001.

==NBA career==

===Miami Heat===
Smith was selected fifth overall in the 1991 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, a young expansion team which featured other young players such as Glen Rice, Rony Seikaly and Brian Shaw. Smith played in 61 games in his rookie season, starting in 59 with averages of 12 points a game and 4.6 assists. The young team made the playoffs to face the top seeded defending champion Chicago Bulls, who swept the Heat in 3 games in the first round. Smith averaged 16 points a game for the series. Injuries limited Smith to 48 games in the 1992–93 season, but he increased his scoring average to 16 points a game. Miami did not make the playoffs that year.

The 1993–94 season would prove to be Smith&#x27;s best in Miami, as he averaged 17.3 points a game with 5.1 assists as the Heat won 42 games and entered the first round of the playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks. The series went to 5 games, as Miami won its first playoff games in franchise history. Smith led the team in scoring during the series with 19.2 points and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point line. Smith would play just two games to start the 1994–95 season before being traded in a fire sale along with Grant Long to Atlanta for Kevin Willis, a deal that was universally regarded as a one-sided heist by Atlanta.

===Atlanta Hawks===

Smith started in 59 of 78 games for Atlanta and averaged 16 points during the regular season and 19 points in the playoffs, as the Hawks lost in a first round sweep to the Indiana Pacers. He would go on to average a then career-high 18.1 points a game in 80 starts in the 1995–96 season, forming a formidable backcourt one-two punch with Mookie Blaylock. The team under head coach Lenny Wilkens would win 46 games and defeat the Indiana Pacers in the first round in 5 games. The next round, while facing the Orlando Magic, Smith led all scorers in a Game 4 win with 35 points, before Atlanta lost the series 4 games to 1. Smith averaged 21.7 points in 10 playoff games that postseason.

The following season would feature another career high scoring average (20.1) for Smith, as he continued to serve as the Hawks&#x27; main option on offense. On March 14, 1997, Smith made a career high 9 three-pointers en route to a 36-point total, during a loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. On April 9, Smith recorded a career high 5 steals in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers. Atlanta also featured players such as solid power-forward Christian Laettner and defensive star Dikembe Mutombo, and would go on to win 56 games before meeting and defeating the Detroit Pistons in a 5-game first round series. Smith played well against Detroit and held his own against Michael Jordan and the defending champion Chicago Bulls, who defeated the Hawks in 5 games in the semifinals. The following season would be similar to Smith as he once again averaged 20.1 points a game, but this time managed to be named an NBA All-Star as he scored 14 points in 16 minutes of action in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Hawks would disappoint in the playoffs yet again however, this time losing to the Charlotte Hornets 3 games to 1 in the conference semifinals despite a 24.8 ppg scoring average by Smith for the series.

The 1998–99 season would be limited to 50 games as a result of a league wide lockout, and in 36 games Smith averaged 18.7 points a game and led the Hawks to another 5 game first round victory over Detroit. The Hawks had no answer, however, for the New York Knicks, and again the Hawks were eliminated in the semifinals. Smith averaged 17.3 points a game in the 1999 playoffs. In the offseason, the Hawks traded Smith in a 4 player trade to the Portland Trail Blazers alongside Ed Gray in exchange for Jim Jackson and Isaiah Rider.

===Portland Trail Blazers===
Portland was a loaded team that had reached the Western Conference Finals in the 2000 playoffs and featured star forward Rasheed Wallace as well as the newly acquired Scottie Pippen. Smith would no longer be required to carry the offensive load, and averaged 14.9 points a game in 81 starts as the Trail Blazers secured the second best record in the Western Conference. Smith would increase his scoring average to 17.1 in the playoffs, as Portland would defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round before beating the Utah Jazz in the semifinals. Up next would be the league best Los Angeles Lakers, who took a 3–1 series lead over Portland before the Trail Blazers won game 5 on the road and game 6 at home as Smith scored 26 points to set up a game 7 matchup. Despite leading by double digits heading into the fourth quarter, the Lakers came back to win the game and advance to the NBA Finals where they would win the NBA Title.

That summer, Smith represented the United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics for the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team, which won the gold medal. He averaged just over 6 points a game in the Olympics including a 12-point performance against China in the group stage of the tournament.

The Trail Blazers entered the 2000–01 season with high expectations, but struggled to repeat the success of the previous season, as injuries took their toll and new additions and trades hurt team chemistry. Smith only started in 36 of 81 games, but still managed to 13.6 points a game. Portland would suffer another loss to the Lakers in the playoffs, this time in a three-game sweep in the first round. Following the season he would be traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Derek Anderson and Steve Kerr.

===San Antonio Spurs===
The Spurs featured superstars Tim Duncan and David Robinson, and were attempting to win another championship as they had in 1999. Smith would be utilized as the team&#x27;s starting shooting guard, averaging 11.6 points a game in 76 starts while leading in the league in three-point shooting at 47 percent for the season. Smith would average double figure scoring in the Spurs&#x27; first round win over the Seattle SuperSonics, including 17 points in a game 1 victory, but struggled against the defending champion L.A. Lakers, who defeated the Spurs in 5 games.

The following 2002–03 season would mark Smith&#x27;s final year in San Antonio, while second-year point guard Tony Parker blossomed into the team&#x27;s second leading scorer. The same was the case for guard Stephen Jackson who consequently came to serve as the team&#x27;s main starting shooting guard, with Smith starting in just 18 games for the season as a result of injuries limiting him to just 58 total games. As a result, Smith averaged 6.8 points a game, and would be used sparingly in the Spurs&#x27; playoff run, in which the team eliminated the Phoenix Suns, the three-time champion Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks before defeating the New Jersey Nets in six games to win the NBA title, Smith&#x27;s first and only championship. Just before the 2003–2004 season started, the free agent Smith signed with the New Orleans Hornets.

===New Orleans Hornets===
Smith played in 71 games for the Hornets, who were led by Baron Davis and Jamaal Magloire. He averaged 5 points a game and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point arc. The Hornets made the playoffs but lost in a grueling back and forth series against Miami. Despite losing the final 7th game in Miami, Smith scored 25 points, including 5 three-pointers, against his former team. Once again a free agent before the following season, Smith signed with the Charlotte Bobcats.

===Charlotte Bobcats and return to Miami===
Smith played in 37 games for the young Bobcats team, and averaged 7.9 points a game, including hitting the franchise&#x27;s first three-point field goal. At midseason he was traded to Miami for Malik Allen. He would be used sparingly by the Heat, including in their playoff run which concluded with a loss in the conference finals to the defending champion Detroit Pistons. Following the season Smith announced his retirement.

==Post-NBA career==
Smith worked as an announcer on Atlanta Hawks games with Bob Rathbun and on the Big Ten Network as a college basketball analyst. For the 2008 season, Smith took a position at NBA TV, and was replaced for Hawks broadcasts by Dominique Wilkins. During the 2011 NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the Atlanta team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.

==Charitable work==
Smith is well known for his charitable pursuits, including a US$2.5 million gift in 1997 to his alma mater, Michigan State University, where he was a star guard under coach Jud Heathcote. Smith&#x27;s donation helped to fund the Clara Bell Smith Student Athlete Academic Center, which is named for his mother. This was the largest single donation by a professional athlete to his former school in history.
Smith also has a close philanthropic relationship with Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta where he has hosted fundraising events for the pediatric hospital.

==Personal life==
Smith first met his wife, Millie, at a charity tennis tournament in Detroit. They had a long-distance relationship for more than a year before getting married in 1996. The couple have two sons, Brayden and Davis, and Smith often coaches them in soccer and basketball. He is the older cousin of NBA point guard Kay Felder.

Smith resides in Atlanta.

<text>Paula Maria Bonaparte Leclerc Borghese (, ; 20 October 1780 – 9 June 1825), better known as Pauline Bonaparte, was an imperial French princess, the first sovereign Duchess of Guastalla, and the princess consort of Sulmona and Rossano. She was the sixth child of Letizia Ramolino and Carlo Buonaparte, Corsica&#x27;s representative to the court of King Louis XVI of France. Her elder brother, Napoleon, was the first emperor of the French. She married Charles Leclerc, a French general, a union ended by his death in 1802.

Later, Pauline married Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona. Her only child, Dermide Leclerc, born from her first marriage, died in childhood. She was the only Bonaparte sibling to visit Napoleon in exile on his principality, Elba.

==Early life==

Maria Paola Buonaparte, the sixth child of Letizia Ramolino and Carlo Maria Buonaparte, Corsica&#x27;s representative to the court of King Louis XVI of France, was born on 20 October 1780 in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was popularly known as &quot;Paolina&quot; in Italian. Her family soon took also a French spelling of their surname, Bonaparte. She is said to be Napoleon&#x27;s favorite sister. Little is known about her childhood, except that she received no formal education. Following Carlo&#x27;s death in 1785, the family was plunged into poverty.

Pauline&#x27;s brother Lucien Bonaparte made seditious comments at the local Jacobin chapter in the summer of 1793, forcing the family to flee to the mainland. It was there on the mainland that she became known as &quot;Paulette&quot;. The income the Bonapartes earned from their vineyards and other holdings on Corsica was interrupted by the British capture of the island in 1794. Their economic situation became so dire that the Bonaparte women reportedly resorted to washing clothes for payment. Regardless, they received, like other French refugees from Corsica, a stipend from the French government. From their landing place, Toulon, they moved to Marseille, where General Napoleon Bonaparte, her elder brother, introduced her to Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron, the proconsul of Marseille. He intended them to marry, but Letizia objected. Napoleon, despite the fact that Pauline loved Stanislas, married her to General Charles Leclerc in French-occupied Milan on 14 June 1797. Napoleon returned to Paris and delegated the office of commander-in-chief of the French army in Italy to his brother-in-law. Pauline gave birth to a boy, Dermide Louis Napoleon, on 20 April 1798. In celebration, General Leclerc acquired a property outside Novellara worth 160,000 French francs. Ill-health forced Leclerc to resign from his military post in October of the same year; he was transferred to Paris. Leclerc was again relocated upon arrival, this time to Brittany. Pauline stayed in Paris with Dermide. Laure de Permond—the future Duchesse d&#x27;Abrantès—and her mother welcomed Pauline into their salon at the rue Saint-Croix. Napoleon seized power in Coup of Brumaire in November 1799: deposing the Directory, he pronounced himself First Consul.

==Saint-Domingue==
Saint-Domingue in the West Indies (modern-day Haiti) had been a French colony since 1697, but had been in rebellion against France since 1791. Napoleon wished to restore French authority there, and so organized an expedition. He put General Leclerc at its head, appointing him Governor-General of the island. Leclerc, Dermide, and Pauline embarked for the colony from Brest on 14 December 1801. Leclerc&#x27;s fleet totaled 74 ships. The gubernatorial family occupied the flagship, &quot;l&#x27;Océan&quot;. After a 45-day journey, the fleet arrived in Le Cap harbour. The Governor-General ordered General Christophe, who commanded a force of 5,000 soldiers, to resign Le Cap to French authority. After all attempts at conciliation failed, Leclerc attacked the town under cover of darkness. Christophe responded by razing Le Cap to the ground. Pauline, meanwhile, was left aboard the flagship with their son. According to Leclerc, in a letter dated 5 March to Napoleon, &quot;The disastrous events in the midst of which she [Pauline] found herself wore her down to the point of making her ill.&quot; Leclerc succeeded in requisitioning the capitulation of the rebel leader, Toussaint L&#x27;ouverture, in May.

However, celebrations were dampened by the advent of yellow fever season: 25 generals and 25,000 soldiers died from the fever. Leclerc had initially guaranteed that slavery, abolished by the Jacobin republic in 1794, would stay proscribed; however, the inhabitants caught wind of its re-establishment in another French colony, neighbouring Guadeloupe, in July. The French government had eliminated slavery in May. As a result, the indigenous residents of Saint-Domingue planned an insurrection for September 16. Black troops in Leclerc&#x27;s army defected to their old commanders, and the Governor-General had a mere 2,000 men against the rebels&#x27; 10,000. Leclerc, fearing for Pauline&#x27;s safety, gave express orders to Jacques de Norvin, a sergeant, to remove Pauline from Saint-Domingue at a moment&#x27;s notice, but these precautions proved unnecessary when Leclerc defeated the insurgents.

The climate was taking its toll on Pauline&#x27;s health. She could no longer walk and was compelled to a &quot;reclining position&quot; for several hours a day. Both she and Dermide suffered from spells of yellow fever. She did, however, find time to take numerous lovers, including several of her husband&#x27;s soldiers, and developed a reputation for &quot;Bacchanalian promiscuity.&quot;

Leclerc attempted to convince Pauline to return to Paris in August. She consented on the condition that &quot;he [Leclerc]...give me 100,000 francs.&quot; When the Governor-General refused, she elected to stay in Saint-Domingue; observing that unlike in Paris, &quot;Here, I reign like Josephine [Napoleon&#x27;s wife]; I hold first place.&quot;

To occupy herself, Pauline compiled a collection of local flora and established a menagerie, inhabited by native animals.

On 22 October 1802, Leclerc fell ill. A doctor from the military hospital in Le Cap diagnosed him with a fever &quot;caused by the bodily and mental hardships that the general [Leclerc] had suffered.&quot; Biographer Flora Fraser believes that his symptoms were consistent with those of yellow fever. He died on 1 November. Seven days later, Pauline, Dermide, and Leclerc&#x27;s remains were hastily ferried back to mainland France.

==Princess Borghese==
Pauline reached the Bay of Toulon on 1 January 1803. That same day she wrote to Napoleon: &quot;I have brought with me the remains of my poor Leclerc. Pity poor Pauline, who is truly unhappy.&quot;

On 11 February, she arrived in the capital, where Napoleon made arrangements for her to lodge with their brother Joseph. Parisian rumour had it that she extracted gold and jewels from the indigenous peoples in Saint-Domingue and brought the treasure back in Leclerc&#x27;s sarcophagus, but this was not the case. She inherited 700,000 francs in liquid capital and assets from Leclerc.

Tiring of life with Joseph, Pauline went about acquiring Hôtel Charost from the duchess to whom it belonged. She confided in a friend that she &quot;was bored&quot; with the code of mourning outlined in the First Consul&#x27;s civil code, compelling her to withdraw from Parisian society, which, before her time in Saint-Domingue, had had her at its center. Napoleon did not wish her to remain unmarried for long; he tried—but failed—to betroth her to the Duke of Lodi and Vice-President of the Napoleonic Republic of Italy, Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril. Pope Pius VII&#x27;s envoy, Giovanni Battista Caprara, suggested Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona, a Roman noble. The First Consul believed the union would consolidate ties with French-occupied Italy, where animosity toward the aggressor was rife. That, combined with pressure from her brothers Joseph and Lucien, induced her to marry him. The marriage contract brought Camillo a dowry of 500,000 francs; to Pauline, it brought 300,000 francs worth of jewelry and the use of the Borghese family diamonds. On 28 August 1803, they were married by Caprara, but without the knowledge of Napoleon, who had wanted a November wedding for mourning protocol&#x27;s sake. Upon discovering Pauline&#x27;s deceit, he refused to acknowledge her new title: &quot;Please understand, Madame, that there is no princess where I am.&quot; A civil ceremony was held in November to confirm the marriage. However, Pauline continued her extramarital affairs, including an affair with the violinist Niccolò Paganini.

Camillo, Pauline, and Dermide arrived in Rome on 14 November. Pauline, anxious to learn how to behave in Roman society, received tutorship in deportment and dancing. Biographer William Carlton suggests that Pauline— a minor noble from Corsica—would never have made such an advantageous match if it were it not for Napoleon&#x27;s political eminence. Pauline&#x27;s initial amity toward Camillo soon morphed into dislike. Her son Dermide, always a delicate child, died on 14 August 1804 in the Aldobrandini villa in Frascati, after a violent fever and convulsions. Three years later, in 1807, his remains were moved next to those of his father in the park grounds of the Château de Montgobert.

==After Napoleon&#x27;s fall==
In 1806, Napoleon made his sister sovereign Princess and Duchess of Guastalla; however, she soon sold the duchy to Parma for six million francs, keeping only the title of Princess of Guastalla. Pauline fell into temporary disfavor with her brother because of her hostility to his second wife, Empress Marie Louise, but when Napoleon&#x27;s fortune failed, Pauline showed herself more loyal than any of his other sisters and brothers.

Upon Napoleon&#x27;s fall, Pauline liquidated all of her assets and moved to Elba, using that money to better Napoleon&#x27;s condition. She was the only Bonaparte sibling to visit her brother during his exile on Elba. Her home in Paris, the Hôtel de Charost, was sold to the British government and used by the Duke of Wellington as his official residence during his tenure as British Ambassador to France. Today the house is still the home of the British ambassador.

After Waterloo Pauline moved to Rome, where she enjoyed the protection of Pope Pius VII (who once was her brother&#x27;s prisoner), as did her mother, Letizia, (then at a palace on the Piazza Venezia) and other members of the Bonaparte family. Pauline lived in a villa between the Porta Pia and the Porta Salaria that was called Villa Paolina after her and decorated in the Egyptomania style she favored. Her husband, Camillo, lived in the Palazzo Borghese, but then moved to Florence to distance himself from her and had a ten-year relationship with a mistress. Even so, Pauline persuaded the Pope to convince the prince to take her back only three months before her death from pulmonary tuberculosis. She died in his Palazzo Salviati-Borghese in Florence.

== Health ==

Pauline was of frail health for much of her life, probably due to salpingitis. She died on 9 June 1825 at the age of forty-four at the Palazzo Salviati-Borghese in Florence, the cause of death being given as &#x27;tumor on the stomach&#x27; but it may have been pulmonary tuberculosis.

<doc id="1179999" wikidata="Q306870" url="?curid=1179999" title="Abby Aldrich Rockefeller">
<text>Abigail Greene Aldrich Rockefeller (October 26, 1874 – April 5, 1948) was an American socialite and philanthropist. She was a prominent member of the Rockefeller family through her marriage to financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., the son of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller Sr. Her father was Nelson W. Aldrich, who served as a Senator from Rhode Island. Rockefeller was known for being the driving force behind the establishment of the Museum of Modern Art. She was the mother of Nelson Rockefeller, who served from 1974 to 1977 as the 41st vice president of the United States.

==Early life==
Abigail Greene Aldrich was born in Providence, Rhode Island, as the fourth child of Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman Chapman. The majority of her childhood was divided between Providence and Warwick Neck (in Rhode Island), and Washington, D.C.

Owing to her father&#x27;s prominence as a congressman, Rockefeller was introduced at an early age to elevated political circles. The figures that her parents entertained included Senator Eugene Hale, Senator William P. Frye, General Ambrose Burnside, and Elizabeth Bacon Custer.

Her early education came at the hands of Quaker governesses. From 1891 to 1893, she was enrolled at Miss Abbott&#x27;s School for Young Ladies in Providence, Rhode Island. There she studied English composition and literature, French, German, art history, ancient history, gymnastics, and dancing. In November 1893 she made her social debut at her coming-out party, which sparked her lifelong love of social events.

On June 30, 1894, on a trip fostered by her father, Rockefeller sailed to Liverpool, beginning a lifetime of extensive European and later Asian travel. Her initial four-month sojourn included stops in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France. This and future trips featured visits to numerous art galleries, informing her future discernment as an art collector.

== Marriage to John D. Rockefeller Jr. ==
In late 1894, she met John Davison Rockefeller Jr., the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman, at a friend&#x27;s house in Providence. Their long courtship is documented in her engagement books, which were used to formally detail her meetings with potential suitors. In early 1895, they began to share walks together on Sunday afternoons. These meetings progressed further until late August 1901, when they became engaged. They married on October 9, 1901, in the major society wedding of the Gilded Age, in front of around a thousand of the elite personages of the time, at her father&#x27;s summer home, &quot;Indian Oaks&quot;, in Warwick Neck, Kent County, Rhode Island.

The couple settled in at 13 West 54th Street in Manhattan from 1901 until 1913, when her husband finished constructing a nine-story mansion at 10 West 54th Street, the largest in New York City at the time. They resided at &quot;Number 10&quot; until 1938 when they moved to a 40-room triplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue. Both of them also owned properties in Pocantico Hills, New York, Seal Harbor, Maine, and Williamsburg, Virginia. They became the parents of six children: Abby Rockefeller Mauzé, John D. Rockefeller III, Nelson Rockefeller, Laurance Rockefeller, Winthrop Rockefeller, and David Rockefeller.

==Death==
Abby Rockefeller suffered a heart attack and died on April 5, 1948, at the Rockefeller family home at 740 Park Avenue in New York City, at the age of 73.

She was cremated and her ashes were spread at a private burial place in Pocantico Hills, New York. A memorial service was held for her at the Riverside Church.

Her will was filed for probate on April 22, 1948, and her gross estate was appraised at $1,156,269. As per her final wishes, four major works were bequeathed to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA): &quot;Lady With a Parasol&quot; and &quot;Seated Woman&quot;, both by Georges Seurat; &quot;Street at Saintes-Maries&quot; and &quot;Corridor at Saint-Remy&quot; by Vincent van Gogh. She left her Oriental miniatures to the Fogg Museum. Her residuary estate of $850,848, minus estate taxes of $250,000, was donated to the MoMA.

A number of dedications were made in her honor and in remembrance of her commitment as an art collector. One such was the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Print Room at the MoMA, which with her gift of sixteen hundred prints was opened on May 15, 1949. The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center was opened in 1957 in Colonial Williamsburg to house her collection of folk art.

A number of prominent figures paid homage to Rockefeller after her death. Artist Henri Matisse contributed a stained glass window for the Union Church in Pocantico Hills. In the spring of 1954, at eighty-four years old, the then-bedridden Matisse was asked to design a stained glass window for the Union Church as a memorial to Rockefeller. He regretfully refused the commission because his deteriorating health would prevent him from visiting and studying the location. After Nelson Rockefeller sent him a series of photographs of the location, Matisse changed his mind and began to work on the project. On November 1, 1954, he wrote that he had happily completed the work, and he died two days later.

==Patronage of modern art and contributions to the Museum of Modern Art==

=== Patron of modern art ===
Abby Rockefeller began collecting paintings, watercolors, and drawings by a number of contemporary American artists in 1925, as well as a number of European modernists: Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. She became a prominent patron of modern art.

In 1928, she employed Donald Deskey to create a series of furnished rooms, done in the art deco style, for the Rockefeller home. These rooms were dubbed the &quot;Topside Gallery&quot;, and served as a display area for Rockefeller&#x27;s growing art collection. The art in the room was regularly cycled, forming curated exhibitions of Rockefeller&#x27;s modern and folk art collections. Visitors to the gallery rode an elevator to the 7th floor of the Rockefeller home, keeping the gallery separate, though connected, from private family areas. The news of her interests and activities spread quickly from this period, and many subsequent collectors began to follow her lead.

=== Co-founder of Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) ===
Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Quinn Sullivan, and Rockefeller joined to conceptualize what is now known as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Quickly, they gathered the support of other prominent figures including: Anson Goodyear, Murray Crane, and Paul J. Sachs. The founding board consisted of seven members, with Goodyear as the president. The first quarters for the museum were rented at 730 Fifth Avenue in New York and Alfred H. Barr Jr. was appointed as the museum&#x27;s first director.

Since her husband only gave her a relatively small allowance, she could not solely rely on him to finance the new museum. His financial support was especially limited due to his personal distaste for modern art. Thus, financing for the museum and acquisition of paintings came from Rockefeller&#x27;s solicitation of the public, corporations, and prominent New York residents.

Rockefeller was elected to MoMA&#x27;s board of trustees in October 1929 and served as inaugural treasurer from 1929 until 1934. Her other roles included terms as First Vice-president from 1934 until 1936, and First Vice-chairman from 1941 to 1945. Her son Nelson Rockefeller was involved in the museum alongside her, starting out as chairman of the junior advisory committee and rising to president.

Chief among Rockefeller&#x27;s concerns at the new museum was the strength of the permanent collection. She often privately gave her own money to the museum for the purchase of new acquisitions. In 1938, she granted the museum its first purchase fund, which was handsomely increased by Nelson Rockefeller.

Many ideas concerning the development of the museum originated with Rockefeller. For example, it was Rockefeller who campaigned for the creation of the museum&#x27;s film library. Also, it was Rockefeller&#x27;s idea to create the War Veterans&#x27; Art Center. This center aimed to rehabilitate veterans of World War II through the practice of art. Stephen Clark was her co-sponsor on the project, Kenneth Chorley was the supervisor of the center&#x27;s activities, and Victor D&#x27;Amico was the supervisor of activities. The center served 1485 veterans until it was closed in June 1948, in an effort to rejoin veteran artists with civilian artists at the People&#x27;s Art Center.

Rockefeller&#x27;s legacy at the museum is preserved in the form of a number of dedications including the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Print Room, which opened in 1949, after her death. The room houses Rockefeller&#x27;s gift of 1600 prints, which had been given nine years earlier. The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden was also named in her honor. The garden was designed by architect Philip Johnson and opened in 1953.

== Patronage of folk art and contributions to Abby Aldrich Museum of Folk Art ==

=== Patron of folk art ===
In 1929, Rockefeller became an early customer of the &quot;Downtown Gallery&quot;, run by art dealer, Edith Halpert. Halpert was selling 19th-century pictures and weathervanes that had been gathered from New England. The timing was perfect for Rockefeller because she and her husband has just began contributing to restoration works at what is now known as Colonial Williamsburg. Her years of collecting spanned from the late 1920s to 1942.

Her collection included: paintings, weathervanes, shop signs, pottery, quilts, and other decorative household items. Some of her favorite types of items in her collection were: children&#x27;s portraits and student art, in the form of calligraphy, memorials, and theorems.

The original pieces of the collection were largely sourced from New England and Pennsylvania, though later it included Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

Rockefeller&#x27;s collection grew with the help of Holger Cahill and Edith Halpert. Outside of the employment of these two curators, most of the items in the collection were discovered in their places of origin. For example, in 1934, Cahill was sent by Rockefeller to the southern United States to personally gather new items for the collection. On this trip, Cahill found items in people&#x27;s sitting rooms, attics, and carpenter&#x27;s shops. In Orangeburg, South Carolina, Cahill found one of Rockefeller&#x27;s most important acquisitions, a watercolor titled &quot;The Old Plantation.&quot;

A portion of Rockefeller&#x27;s collection was purchased from Elie Nadelman, who had lost his fortune to the Great Depression. Nadelman&#x27;s folk art collection purchased and split amongst Rockefeller, Henry Francis du Pont, the Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Brummer Galleries.

=== Early exhibitions of the collection ===
In 1930 and 1931, the Newark Museum exhibited a collection of American folk art. Approximately 10 percent of these items were attributed to the same anonymous donor, in actuality the donor was Abby Rockefeller.

In 1932, Rockefeller&#x27;s collection was again loaned anonymously, this time to the Museum of Modern Art for an exhibition titled &quot;American Folk Art: The Art of the Common Man in America&quot;. Of the 175 objects on display, 174 of the objects belonged to Rockefeller, with the remaining single object belonging to Henry Cahill. The exhibition was highly successful, and became the first traveling exhibition of American folk art, visiting six American cities from 1932 to 1934.

The objects displayed during these two early exhibitions were mostly from New England and Pennsylvania and constituted a wide range of art categories including: oil paintings, pastels, watercolors, paintings on velvet, paintings on glass, wood sculptures, metal sculptures, and chalkware.

=== Development of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum ===
In 1934, Rockefeller began to lend parts of her collection for permanent display in the Ludwell-Paradis House in Colonial Williamsburg. The exhibits were installed mostly under the guidance of Edith Halpert and opened to the public in 1935, remaining open until January 1956. Other pieces were hung in Colonial Williamsburg in neighboring exhibition buildings or operating taverns, blending in with the existing decor.

In 1939, fifty-four pieces of the folk art collection were donated to the Museum of Modern Art.

In 1954, six years after Abby Rockefeller&#x27;s death, the March edition of &quot;Antiques&quot; magazine published an announcement that a new museum would house the Rockefeller folk art collection. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. provided the funds for construction of the project and the purchase of new objects. This endowment was so large that the museum was able to acquire over a hundred new objects in its first year.

== Philanthropy ==

=== Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) ===
John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s wedding gift to Abby was a sum of money, which she promptly donated to the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) of Providence in Rhode Island. Later, she was active in the YWCA of New York.

From 1918 to 1936 she held active service in the YWCA, though upon her retirement from leadership roles, she was considered an honorary member. She was a member of the YWCA&#x27;s National Board, and served as the vice-president and chairman of numerous committees. Notably, in 1918 she was elected as chairman of the Housing Committee of the War Work Council. The committee was organized during World War I with the objective of providing improved living conditions for working women. For example, she recruited the architect Duncan Candler to design a house in Charleston, South Carolina to house women who worked at a naval uniform factory.

Rockefeller was director of the YWCA operated and owned Grace Dodge Hotel in Washington D.C., which was constructed in October 1921. Rockefeller monitored financial reports and oversaw advertisements for the hotel, with the primary goal of serving female workers. She objected to racial discrimination in the wages, status, and living arrangements of the staff at the Grace Dodge Hotel.

=== Good Fellowship Council ===
Via the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, the Good Fellowship Council was formed, inviting all people of the local neighborhood to join. The meetings aimed to open discussion on neighborhood problems including: traffic lights, sanitation, schools, and child welfare. Originally the club was organized for women, but later allowed men to join as well.

Abby Rockefeller served as the chairman of the Good Fellowship Council and led monthly meetings while visiting a range of community sub-clubs. The meetings were attended by 300 to 400 people.

The meetings featured many guest speakers, including the President of the American Federation of Labor, doctors specializing in child care, experts in immigration law, and architects specializing in commercial spaces. Musical performances given in native languages and forms of dress were given by members of the club regularly.

=== Bayway Community Cottage ===
In October 1920, Rockefeller desired to create a demonstration structure for the employees of the Bayway Refinery of Standard Oil, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The structure was meant to be an example of a worker&#x27;s home, though soon the purpose of the cottage extended to one of community learning. The cottage hosted cooking classes, a Mothers&#x27; Club, and a baby clinic. In 1926, the cottage was expanded to include a club-room, larger kitchen, larger baby clinic, gymnasium, and office for social workers. In 1939, another addition created a bowling alley and other game rooms. In 1947, 9700 people made use of the Bayway Community Cottage in some way.

=== International House of New York ===
Abby Rockefeller was the chairman of the Furnishing Committee of the International House of New York. As chairman, she strove to add American decor to the interior of the building, drawing largely on her childhood in Providence, Rhode Island for inspiration. For twenty-five years she was a regular visitor to the International House, and for many years she and her husband hosted Christmas parties for its residents.

===Colonial Williamsburg===
In the mid-1920s, Abby and her husband were contacted by Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, who was rector of Bruton Parish Church and an instructor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. After seeing Dr. Goodwin&#x27;s restored church, they explored further his concept of a massive restoration of the city to its glory days prior to the American Revolution, as the capital of the Virginia Colony. They became committed to funding the project, which commenced in 1927 and, when in town, resided at Bassett Hall, one of the 88 original surviving buildings included in Godwin&#x27;s restoration.

The result was Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum which has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. One of the museums within the complex, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, is named in her honor.

<doc id="1180004" wikidata="Q2631873" url="?curid=1180004" title="Falcon 4.0">
<text>Falcon 4.0 is a combat flight simulation video game developed by MicroProse and published by Hasbro Interactive in 1998. The game is based around a realistic simulation of the Block 50/52 F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighter in a full-scale modern war set in the Korean Peninsula.

The game is the ultimate development in the &quot;Falcon&quot; series from Spectrum HoloByte that began in 1984. HoloByte had acquired MicroProse in 1993, and started using that name for all of its titles in 1996. After MicroProse was purchased by Hasbro, official development ended. In 2000, a source code leak allowed continued development of the game by members of the gaming community, including bug fixes and new campaigns. Many of these additions were collected by Lead Pursuit, which arranged an official license of the original code base from the owner Atari; these were published as &quot;Falcon 4.0: Allied Force&quot; in 2005. Spanning well over a decade, the &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; series is one of the longest running game series using the same code base in PC history.

In the present day, the game is still supported by a community of players with the most supported branch of the game being the one by Benchmark Sims Community, called Falcon BMS.

On May 4, 2023, after a 24 year long absence, developer MicroProse announced the reacquisition of the copyright to the Falcon series, including Falcon 4.0.

== Gameplay ==
The game&#x27;s story begins in the early 1990s with North Korean forces invading South Korea. The United States deploys extensive support to the South, including military aircraft, armored forces, and naval vessels. The rest of the game plays out in response to the player&#x27;s actions, potentially involving China and Russia. Japan has an airbase, but plays no role in the conflict itself. Because of the game&#x27;s story content, which involves war in the Korean Peninsula, it was banned in South Korea until 2003.

&quot;Falcon 4.0&quot;&#x27;s gameplay parallels actual fighter pilot combat operations. First, over 30 training scenarios acquaint the player with F-16 maneuvering, avionics operation, and various USAF protocols. After training, the player may start the primary gameplay mode in the campaign, which simulates participation in a modern war. Alternatively, the player may engage in dogfight mode, which provides an individual air engagement without any continuous context, or create what are effectively miniature campaigns, known as &quot;Tactical Engagements&quot;.

The results of the player&#x27;s performance are used to generate a &#x27;logbook&#x27;. This contains details such as flight hours, air-to-air and air-to-ground kills, decorations, a name and photo, and the current rank of the player. Good performance (such as eliminating large numbers of enemy ground units, or surviving a difficult engagement) during a mission may lead to the award of a decoration or promotion; conversely, poor performance (destroying friendly targets or ejecting from the aircraft for no good reason) can lead to demotion or court-martial.

Campaign gameplay has two primary stages, briefings and missions. The briefing section is used to handle the planning of flights and packages (a number of flights grouped together for mutual support in obtaining a military objective), assignment of steerpoints for determining the route of a given flight, and the weapons loadout used by the aircraft. It is also possible to issue instructions to each ground unit manually, overriding the AI&#x27;s handling of the war. As is the situation for real life pilots, it is of the utmost importance that the player examines closely all of the data presented here to perform well during the mission, in order to best formulate a plan of action when actually flying the jet. Failing to note the location and abilities of enemy SAM sites or CAP aircraft and account for methods of defeating these will almost certainly result in a short flight.

The mission section of the simulator encompasses the actual mechanics of flying the aircraft, radar and weapons operation, threat evaluation, radio communications and navigation. Everything is done in such a manner as to model the aircraft in use as closely as possible, while on the highest realism settings.

The initial release of the software came with three pre-set scenarios for the player to use in campaign mode. &#x27;Tiger Spirit&#x27; depicted a war where ROK and Allied forces had repelled the initial DPRK assault and moved onto the offensive. &#x27;Rolling Fire&#x27; depicted a closely matched situation where DPRK forces had overrun the DMZ and made small gains, while &#x27;Iron Fortress&#x27; simulated a scenario where the North had overwhelmed the South and pushed it back to its last line of defense.

Unlike its static counterpart, a dynamic campaign has no set game path. Missions and the rest of the game world develop as the game progresses, affected in part by the player&#x27;s behavior. Dynamic campaigns can present a more random and diverse game experience, but are more difficult for programmers to implement. The AI controlling the activity of the &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; campaign engine can be influenced by a wide range of configurable settings, all of which can be adjusted to meet changing objectives as the scenario progresses.

A Tactical Engagement (or TE) is a small scale, hand-built, &#x27;one-shot&#x27; mission with a pre-defined objective. The same engine handles the activities of AI controlled units. One of the advantages of building this style of mission is that it allows experienced pilots to practice attacks on high value, well defended targets, which are often eliminated from campaigns early on as the planning AI assigns packages to eliminate them in order to maximise the effect on enemy combat readiness.

The Instant Action mode of operation places the user in an F-16 currently in flight, armed with an infinite number of missiles. Progressively more capable waves of enemy aircraft then move in and engage the player&#x27;s aircraft. Many different options are available to customise this mode, including disabling SAM and AAA defenses, setting unlimited fuel, and the difficulty of the first wave of inbound hostiles.

&quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; originally featured 3D graphics with multitexturing support. It was one of the first programs on the market which was designed multi-threaded to take advantage of dual-core x86 processors. The game used one thread for graphics and primary simulation and the other for the campaign engine.

==Development==
The game was in development since 1994. The game was originally designed and produced by Steve Blankenship and Gilman Louie and published under the MicroProse label. Though originally slated for a late 1996 release, the game ended up being rushed to market in order to make the 1998 Christmas selling season.

===Source code leak===
On 9 April 2000 a developer of the game leaked the source code of a &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; version between 1.07 and 1.08 on an FTP site. Kevin Klemmick later claimed responsibility for the leak.

===Digital distribution re-releases===
In October 2015, Tommo&#x27;s Retroism publishing label re-released the &quot;Falcon&quot; series (including &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; as a bonus) via digital distribution at GOG.com, titled as the &quot;Falcon Collection&quot;, after being commercially unavailable for some years. In January 2016, Retroism released the &quot;Falcon Collection&quot; on Steam, with all four titles also available for purchase separately.

=== Modern community development ===
&quot;Falcon BMS&quot; (BenchMark Sims) is a community-made total conversion mod for &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot;. The mod, made by Benchmark Sims, is a complete revision of the aging game, adding such features like graphics improvements (DX7 -&gt; DX11), 3D cockpits, a newer terrain engine, partial VR support, and multiplayer code improvements.

&quot;Falcon BMS&quot; is still under active development with the latest version (4.37.4) being released on 5 July 2024, and is available for download on the BMS website.

==Reception and impact==
In the United States, &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; sold 41,209 copies during 1998, after its release on 12 December of that year. These sales accounted for $1.85 million in revenue. By October 1999, its total sales in the region had risen to 116,776 copies, which drew revenues of $4.57 million. It sold 209,000 copies during 1999 alone.

&quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; won &quot;Macworld&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Best Flight Simulation&quot; award. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; likewise named &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; the best simulation of 1998. The game was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s &quot;Best Simulation&quot;, GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;Simulation of the Year&quot;, IGN&#x27;s &quot;Best Simulation of the Year&quot; and &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;″s &quot;Simulation Game of the Year&quot; awards, all of which ultimately went to &quot;European Air War&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; called &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; &quot;extremely impressive&quot;, while those of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described it as a sim with unprecedented detail.

The &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; series is one of the longest running game series in PC history to have used the same code base. The history of &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; spans over two decades due to derivatives like &quot;Falcon 4.0: Allied Force&quot;, the BMS derivative from 2012, and other variants.

<doc id="1180009" wikidata="Q1773505" url="?curid=1180009" title="Chris Connelly (musician)">
<text>Chris Connelly (born 11 November 1964) is a Scottish musician and author. He is notable for his industrial music work of the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly his involvement with the Revolting Cocks and Ministry.

==Early years==
Connelly was born in Bruntsfield, Scotland to Michael and Sadie (née King) Connelly near the city centre of Edinburgh. Connelly&#x27;s father died in a swimming accident early in his life, causing Chris to focus on artistic interests outside the home to help fill the void. Connelly&#x27;s Scottish ancestry includes Irish descent through the Connellys and Murphys, who originally came from Ireland to Scotland. His mother&#x27;s side, the Kings and the McCullochs, were from the Highlands and migrated to Glasgow in search of work.

== Music career ==
Connelly began his music career in 1980 with the formation of Fini Tribe. Through subsequent years he fronted or was heavily involved with numerous notable industrial, dance, and new wave acts. In 2008, Connelly published a memoir of his early years in the music industry, &quot;Concrete, Bulletproof, Invisible, and Fried: My Life As A Revolting Cock&quot; (). It describes his professional debut in Finitribe, meeting Al Jourgensen in London, his involvement with the Revolting Cocks, Ministry, PTP, Acid Horse, Front Line Assembly, Murder, Inc., and Pigface, and the development of his solo career.

In 2013, he started two more industrial projects: Cocksure, with Jason C. Novak (Czar, Acumen Nation, and DJ? Acucrack), and Bells into Machines, with Paul Barker (Ministry, Revolting Cocks, and Lard), as well as the resurrection of the Cocks sans Al Jourgensen and with Richard 23 of Front 242 in 2016.

==Personal life==
Connelly is now based in Chicago and works at a record store in Wicker Park.

<text>The Battle of Kwajalein was fought as part of the Pacific campaign of World War II. It took place 31 January – 3 February 1944, on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Employing the hard-learned lessons of the Battle of Tarawa, the United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north. The Japanese defenders put up stiff resistance, although outnumbered and under-prepared. The determined defense of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500.

For the US, the battle represented both the next step in its island-hopping march to Japan and a significant morale victory because it was the first time the Americans had penetrated the &quot;outer ring&quot; of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense. Japanese defenses became prepared in depth, and the Battles of Peleliu, Guam, and the Marianas proved far more costly to the US.

==Background==
===Geography===
Kwajalein Atoll is in the heart of the Marshall Islands. It lies in the Ralik Chain, southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii at . Kwajalein is the world&#x27;s largest coral atoll and comprises 93 islands and islets; it has a land area of 1,560 acres (6.33 km2) and surrounds one of the largest lagoons in the world, measuring 324 mi2 (839 km2) in size.

The two most significant land masses are Kwajalein Island in the south and the linked islands of Roi-Namur in the north. By the start of World War II, the Marshalls were already an integral part of the Japanese perimeter of defense. Its facilities were being utilized as outlying bases for submarines and surface warships, as well as for air staging for future advances being planned against Ellice, the Fiji Islands, and Samoa.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===
After the capture of Makin and Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands, the next step in the United States Navy&#x27;s campaign in the central Pacific was the Marshall Island chain. These islands had been Imperial German colonies, after their purchase from Spain in 1899. At the end of World War I they were assigned to Japan in the post-war settlement through the South Seas Mandate. The islands then became a mystery because the Japanese closed them to the outside world. It was presumed the Japanese had built illegal fortifications throughout the islands, but the extent of such fortifications was unknown. Japan regarded them as part of the &quot;outer ring&quot; of their territory.

The strategic importance of the Marshalls had been recognized as early as 1921 in War Plan Orange, an American interwar plan for a possible conflict with Japan. The Marshalls were a key step in the island-hopping march to the Japanese mainland.

After losing the Solomon Islands and New Guinea to the Allies in 1943, the Japanese command decided that the Gilbert and Marshall Islands were expendable. They preferred fighting a decisive battle closer to home. Nevertheless, the Marshalls were reinforced at the end of 1943 to make their capture more costly for the Americans. By January 1944, the regional commander in Truk, Admiral Masashi Kobayashi, had 28,000 troops to defend the Marshalls, although he had very few aircraft.

===Japanese planning and preparation===
The 6th Base Force, under the command of Rear Admiral Monzo Akiyama, and headquartered on Kwajalein since August 1941, was the principal defense force of the islands. Akiyama had his men spread out over a very wide area, with naval-air bases located on Roi-Namur, Mili, Maloelap, Enewetak, and Wotje. Garrison troops on the island included the 1st Company, 3rd Mobile Battalion, 1st Amphibious Brigade, plus units of the 2nd Mobile Battalion.

The defense system on the islands was mostly in line, with little or no depth. The Japanese had twin 12.7 cm guns on each end of the island plus 80mm guns on the ocean and lagoon sides. The 22nd Air Flotilla, depleted after the Gilbert campaign, had 128 aircraft in the Marshalls, 10 on Kwajalein.

===US planning and preparation===

The Marshall campaign planned by the US involved attacks on seven islands, bypassing many more. Operation Flintlock had nine phases, the main phase being the capture of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, a second phase, Operation Catchpole, being the capture of Eniwetok, and further phases being the capture of remaining islands. Bombardment by the Seventh Air Force, and a carrier air attack on 4 December 1943, followed by additional attacks in January 1944, destroyed all Japanese aircraft. 

Staging through Baker Island airfield, Consolidated B-24 Liberators bombed strategic targets. In the beginning, the most important was Mili, the Japanese base closest to the Gilberts and Maloelap, the most powerful enemy bases threatening the upcoming operations. Mili was the subject of several attacks throughout November, causing considerable damage to installations and high losses of aircraft for the Japanese. But Mili remained the only base within fighter reach of the Gilberts, and the defenders managed to keep the facilities there operational and reinforced with aircraft. Following the capture of Tarawa and until 19 December, 106 B-24s dropped a total of of explosives on Mili&#x27;s airbase. The largest of those raids came on 4 December when 34 B-24s pulverized the atoll in conjunction with carrier-based bombing raids of other parts of the Marshalls. On 18 December renewed strikes were initiated against enemy targets on Mili with land-based Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers and Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters making their debut in the Marshall air offensive. Japanese losses for the day amounted to 10 fighters (four on the ground) and four damaged. Other aircraft types participating in the offensive included North American B-25 Mitchells and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks.

It was necessary to take another atoll in the eastern Marshalls—Majuro. This feature is southeast of Kwajalein and could serve as an advanced air and naval base as well as safeguard supply lines to Kwajalein. Majuro was very lightly defended, and the V Amphibious Corps Marine Reconnaissance Company and the 2nd Battalion, 106th Infantry, 27th Infantry Division were employed in its capture. The island was taken on 31 January 1944 without any US casualties.
==Battle==
The US forces for the landings were Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner&#x27;s 5th Fleet Amphibious Force, and Major General Holland M. Smith&#x27;s V Amphibious Corps, which comprised the 4th Marine Division commanded by Major General Harry Schmidt, the Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division commanded by Major General Charles H. Corlett, as well as the 22nd Marines and the Army&#x27;s 106th and 111th Infantry regiments. 

The 4th Marine Division was assigned to Roi-Namur, and the 7th Infantry Division would make the assault on Kwajalein. The 2nd Battalion of the 106th was assigned to the simultaneous capture of Majuro Atoll. The rest of the 106th and the 22nd Marines were in reserve for Kwajalein, while awaiting the following assault on Eniwetok, scheduled for three months later.

The 7th Infantry Division began by capturing the small islands labeled Carlos, Carter, Cecil, and Carlson on 31 January, which were used as artillery bases for the next day&#x27;s assault. Kwajalein Island is long, but it is only wide. There was therefore no possibility of defence in depth, and the Japanese planned to counter-attack the landing beaches. They had not realized until the Battle of Tarawa that American amphibious vehicles could cross coral reefs and land on the lagoon side of an atoll; accordingly the strongest defenses on Kwajalein faced the ocean. The bombardment by the Southern Attack Force, including the battleship , plus B-24 bombers from Abemama and artillery on Carlson island was devastating. The Navy had changed its bombardment tactics based on the Tarawa experience and used armor-piercing shells as well as firing into the island at closer ranges. The official U.S. Army history of the battle quotes a soldier as saying &quot;the entire island looked as if it had been picked up 20,000 feet and then dropped.&quot; Landing beaches Red 1 and 2 were assaulted at 09:30 on 1 February, the Americans reaching halfway across the runway by sunset. Although the Japanese counterattacked every night, the island was declared secure by the end of the fourth day.

On the north side of the atoll, the 4th Marine Division followed a similar plan, first capturing islets Ivan, Jacob, Albert, Allen, and Abraham on 31 January, and then landing on Roi-Namur on 1 February. The airfield on the western half (Roi) was captured quickly, and the eastern half (Namur) fell the next day. The worst setback came when a Marine demolition team threw a satchel charge of high explosives into a Japanese bunker, not realizing it was a torpedo warhead magazine. The resulting explosion killed 20 Marines and wounded dozens more and caused an observation pilot to radio, &quot;The whole damn island has blown up!&quot;

==Aftermath==
The relatively easy capture of Kwajalein demonstrated US amphibious capabilities and showed that the changes to training and tactics after the costly Battle of Tarawa had been effective. It allowed Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, to speed up operations in the Marshalls and invade Ebeye Island on 3–4 February, Engebi Island on 18–19 February, Eniwetok Island on 19–21 February, and Parry Island on 22–23 February.

The Japanese also realized that beach-line defenses were too vulnerable to naval and aerial bombardment. In the campaign for the Mariana Islands, the defense in depth on Guam and Peleliu would be much harder to overcome than the comparatively thin line on Kwajalein.

After the war ended, over 150 still operational US aircraft were sunk near Roi-Namur, which was cheaper than transporting the airplanes back to the US mainland. The airplane graveyard includes several Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, Vought F4U Corsairs, Grumman TBF Avengers, Curtiss SB2C Helldivers, North American B-25 Mitchells, Curtiss C-46 Commandos and Grumman F4F Wildcats.

<text>Izhitsa (Ѵ, ѵ; italics: &quot;Ѵ ѵ&quot;; OCS: ѷжица, Russian: ижица, Ukrainian: іжиця) is a letter of the early Cyrillic alphabet and several later alphabets, usually the last in the row. It originates from the Greek letter upsilon (Y, υ) and was used in words and names derived from or via the Greek language, such as кѵрилъ (&quot;kürilǔ&quot;, &quot;Cyril&quot;, from Greek ) or флаѵии (&quot;flavii&quot;, &quot;Flavius&quot;, from Greek ). It represented the sounds or as normal letters и and в, respectively. The Glagolitic alphabet has a corresponding letter with the name &quot;izhitsa&quot; as well (Ⱛ, ⱛ). Also, izhitsa in its standard form or, most often, in a tailed variant (similar to Latin &quot;y&quot;) was part of a digraph оѵ/оу representing the sound . The digraph is known as Cyrillic &quot;uk&quot;, and today&#x27;s Cyrillic letter u originates from its simplified form.

The letter&#x27;s traditional name, &quot;izhitsa&quot; (ижица), is explained as a diminutive either of the word иго (&quot;igo&quot;, &quot;yoke&quot;), due to the letter&#x27;s shape, or of иже (&quot;izhe&quot;, &quot;which&quot;), the name of the main Cyrillic and Glagolitic letters for the same sound, .
The numeral value of Cyrillic izhitsa is 400. Glagolitic izhitsa has no numeral value. Church Slavonic editions printed in Russia use a tailed variant of the letter for the numeral purpose, whereas editions from Serbia or Romania (including books in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet), as well as early printed books from Ukraine, prefer a basic form of the letter without the tail.

== Russian ==
In the Russian language, the use of izhitsa became progressively rarer during the 18th and 19th centuries. At the beginning of the 20th century, the only two words still spelled with the letter izhitsa in common use were (, , &#x27;chrism&#x27;) and (, , &#x27;synod&#x27;). 
In the documents of the spelling reform of 1917–1918, izhitsa is not mentioned at all, although the statement that it was canceled at that time, along with decimal i, yat and fita, is not only widespread, but also reflected in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. In fact, Ѵ fell out of use in the civil alphabet gradually, under the influence not only of the general direction of changes in the spelling of the Russian language, but also of the displacement of words and texts on religious topics from the civil press. At the same time, steam locomotives of class Izhitsa (Ѵ) were produced until 1931 and were in operation until they were decommissioned in the 1950s.

== Serbian ==
The traditional spelling of Serbian was more conservative; it preserved all etymologically motivated izhitsas in words of Greek origin. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić had reformed the Serbian alphabet in the beginning of the nineteenth century and eliminated the letter, but the old spelling was used in some places as late as the 1880s.

== Church Slavonic ==
Izhitsa is still in use in the Church Slavonic language. Like Greek upsilon, it can be pronounced as (like и), or as (like в). The basic distinction rule is simple: izhitsa with stress and/or aspiration marks is a vowel and therefore pronounced ; izhitsa without diacritical marks is a consonant and pronounced . Unstressed, -sounding izhitsas are marked with a special diacritical mark, the so-called &quot;kendema&quot; or &quot;kendima&quot; (from the Greek word κέντημα ). The shape of kendema over izhitsa may vary: in books of Russian origin, it typically looks like a double grave accent or sometimes like a double acute accent. In older Serbian books, kendema most often looked like two dots (trema) or might even be replaced by a surrogate combination of aspiration and acute. These shape distinctions (with the exception of the aspiration-acute combination) have no orthographical meaning and must be considered as just font style variations, thus the Unicode name &quot;&quot; is slightly misleading. Izhitsa with kendema (majuscule: Ѷ, minuscule: ѷ) is not a separate letter of the alphabet, but it may have personal position in computer encodings (e.g., Unicode). Historically, izhitsa with kendema corresponds to the Greek upsilon with trema (or διαλυτικά: Ϋ, ϋ). While in modern editions of ancient and modern Greek the trema is used only to prevent a digraph (as &lt;ευ&gt; versus &lt;εϋ&gt; ), Slavonic usage of kendema still continues that of many medieval Greek manuscripts, in which the &quot;diaeresis&quot; sign was often used simply to mark an upsilon or iota as such, irrespective of any other vowels (e.g. δϊαλϋτϊκά, which would not be correct by today&#x27;s conventions).

== Romanian ==

Traditional orthography of the Romanian language used izhitsa in the same manner as Church Slavonic, with all the above-mentioned peculiarities. This writing system was used until about 1860 in Romania and until 1920s in church books in Russian-ruled Bessarabia.

== Aleut ==
The Cyrillic letter izhitsa was also used historically in certain loanwords in the Cyrillic script version of Aleut.

== Abkhaz ==
Izhitza was used in the 1909-1926 Abkhaz alphabet of Chochua.

== Izhitsa as a replacement of a different character ==
In Russian typography, the capital form of izhitsa has traditionally been used instead of the Roman numeral V; this tradition survived several decades longer than izhitsa as a letter of the alphabet.

The izhitsa is sometimes used in place of the new IPA symbol for the labiodental flap (ⱱ) because the signs are similar.

==Computing codes==

The tailed variant of izhitsa has no individual position in Unicode; instead, the characters and are supposed to represent it.

<doc id="1180020" wikidata="Q283841" url="?curid=1180020" title="Fita">
<text>Fita (Ѳ ѳ; italics: &quot;Ѳ ѳ&quot;) is a letter of the Early Cyrillic alphabet. The shape and the name of the letter are derived from the Greek letter theta (Θ θ). In the ISO 9 system, Ѳ is romanized using F grave accent (F̀ f̀).

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Fita has a numerical value of 9.

== Shape ==
In traditional (Church Slavonic) typefaces, the central line is typically about twice the width of the letter&#x27;s body and has serifs similar to those on the letter Т: . Sometimes the line is drawn as low as the baseline, which makes the letter difficult to distinguish from Д.

==Usage==

===Old Russian and Church Slavonic===
The traditional Russian name of the letter is &quot;fitá&quot; (or, in pre-1918 spelling, ѳита́). Fita was mainly used to write proper names and loanwords derived from or via Greek. Russians pronounced these names with the sound instead of (like the pronunciation of in &quot;thin&quot;), for example &quot;Theodore&quot; was pronounced as &quot;Feodor&quot; (now &quot;Fyodor&quot;).

Early texts in Russian (and in the Russian recension of Church Slavonic) demonstrate an increasing interchangeability of Ѳ and Ф. Some scribes preferred one of the two letters and ignored the other. There existed an orthographical system to write Ѳ in an initial position and Ф elsewhere. Since the middle of the 17th century, selection between Ѳ and Ф was re-adjusted to exactly follow the Greek origin, the system still in use in Church Slavonic orthography.

===Russian===
In the first variant of the Petrine Russian alphabet (1707–1708), the letter Ф was eliminated and Fita became the only way to represent . Later (1710) the letter Ф (with the same etymological rule of spelling Ѳ and Ф) was restored and both letters co-existed until the 1918 spelling reform, when Fita was eliminated and replaced by the letter Ef (Ф ф).

Many Greek words with Theta were adopted in Russian with Te (Т т) instead of Fita (mostly through Latin or other Western European languages): теорема (theorem), атлетъ (athlete), пантера (panther), фталевый (phthalic), etc. Sometimes dual spellings/pronunciations existed: ѳеатръ/театръ (theatre), аѳеизмъ/атеизмъ (atheism), алгориѳмъ/алгоритмъ (algorithm), каѳолическій/католическій (Catholic), etc.; the variants with Fita (in modern spelling with Ф) are typically more archaic or special.

===Other languages===
In other languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet, Fita was pronounced and was replaced with Te (Т т). For example, the Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian version of Theodore is Тодор &quot;Todor&quot; or Теодор &quot;Teodor&quot;.

===Romanian===
Called &quot;thita&quot;, is part of the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, which was used until about 1860.

===Aleut===
Fita is used in the Cyrillic version of the Aleut alphabet, typically in loanwords.

<text>Ksi (Ѯ, ѯ italics: &quot;Ѯ&quot; &quot;ѯ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is a letter of the early Cyrillic alphabet, derived from the Greek letter Xi (Ξ, ξ). It was mainly used in Greek loanwords, especially words relating to the Church.

Unlike other eliminated letters such as Omega and Yus, Ksi was a later borrowing from Greek and does not appear in any form in the Glagolitic script, which was used until the Middle Ages.

Ksi was eliminated from the Russian alphabet along with psi, omega, and yus in the Civil Script of 1708 (Peter the Great&#x27;s &quot;Grazhdanka&quot;), and has also been dropped from other secular languages. It was briefly restored in 1710 and ultimately deleted in 1735. While it was no longer used in typographic fonts, it continued to be used by the church, and since clergy actively participated in civil censuses, Ksi can be found in multiple handwritten civil texts all the way until the early 1800s.
In the Civil Script during Peter the Great&#x27;s time, Ksi was also written similarly to an izhitsa with a tail.

Ksi constituted the number &quot;60&quot; in the Cyrillic numeral system.

<text>Iotated E or Iotated Ukrainian Ye also known as Iye( ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is used in the Church Slavonic language and Early Cyrillic.

==History==
Iotated E has no equivalent in the Glagolitic alphabet, and probably originated as a ligature of and to represent the sounds or .

==Usage==
Iotated E is found in some of the very oldest examples of Cyrillic writing, such as the tenth-century Mostich inscription or the Codex Suprasliensis, whereas in others, such as the Enina Apostle or Undol&#x27;skij Fragments, it is not present at all. It is plentifully attested in medieval manuscripts of both South Slavic and East Slavic provenance, co-existing with , which fulfils the same function. Orthographic practice nevertheless varies: some manuscripts use all three characters, some and , some and , and some only .

Among the Eastern Slavs fell into disuse after the end of the fourteenth century, and it is not therefore represented in printed books from this area, or in modern Church Slavonic. In the South, however, it survived, and was used in the first Serbian printed book, the Octoechos (&quot;Oktoih prvoglasnik&quot;) of 1474, and appears in the Serbian abecedarium printed in Venice in 1597; its position in the alphabet in this book is between and . It continued to be used in both manuscript and printed material throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but it no longer appears in the alphabet in abecedarium of 1753. In certain orthographical variants of Bulgarian, it can be found at least up to the middle of the 19th century. Bulgarian variants from the 1800s often include the letter as a ligature of and , rather than . The sound of Ѥ is written using the letters Ye (Е) or Ukrainian Ye (Є) in east Slavic languages. South Slavic languages usually use the combinations or .

<text>Ot ( ; italics: &quot; &quot;) is a letter of the early Cyrillic alphabet. Though it originated as a ligature of the letters Omega ( ) and Te ( ), it functions as a discrete letter of the alphabet, placed between and . This can be seen in the first printed Cyrillic abecedarium (illustrated), and continues in modern usage.

Ot is used in Church Slavonic to represent the preposition &#x27;from&#x27; and prefix . It does not stand for this sequence of letters in any other context, nor can the sequence be substituted for it where it does occur. It is used with a similar purpose in mediaeval manuscripts of other Slavonic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet. In printed books is often used in preference to for the numeral 800.

<text>Omega (Ѡ ѡ; italics: &quot;Ѡ ѡ&quot;) is a letter used in the early Cyrillic alphabet. Its name and capital form are derived directly from the Greek letter Omega (Ω ω).

In some forms it looks similar to the letter We.

Unlike Greek, the Slavic languages had only a single sound, so Omega was little used compared to the letter O (О о), descended from the Greek letter Omicron. In the older ustav writing, Omega was used mainly for its numeric value of 800, and rarely appeared even in Greek words. In later semi-ustav manuscripts it was used for decorative purposes, along with the broad version () as well as the Broad On (Ѻ ѻ).

Modern Church Slavonic has developed strict rules for the use of these letterforms.

Another variation of omega is the &quot;ornate&quot; or &quot;beautiful omega&quot;, used as an interjection, &quot;O!&quot;. It is represented in Unicode 5.1 by the misnamed character &quot;omega with titlo&quot; (). It descends from the Greek omega with the smooth breathing (psili) and circumflex (perispomeni) diacritical marks (Ὦ ὦ), also used in the corresponding exclamation in ancient Greek.

<text>Uk (Ѹ ѹ; italics: &quot;Ѹ ѹ&quot;) is a digraph of the early Cyrillic alphabet of the letters О and У, although commonly considered and used as a single letter. To save space, it was often written as a vertical ligature (Ꙋ ꙋ), called &quot;monograph Uk&quot;. In modern times, has been replaced by the simple .
Ѹ is romanized as U, Ꙋ is romanized as Ū.

== Development in Old East Slavic ==

The simplification of the digraph to was first brought about in Old East Slavic texts and only later taken over into South Slavic languages.

One can see this development in the Novgorod birch-bark letters: The degree to which this letter was used here differed in two positions: in word-initial position or before a vowel (except for the jers), and after a consonant.

Before a consonant, was used 89% of the time in the writings before 1100. By 1200, it was used 61% of the time, with the letter used 14% of the time; by 1300, оу had reached 28%, surpassed by at 45%. From the late 14th century on, there are no more instances of being used in this position, with appearing 95% of the time.

The decrease in usage was more gradual after a consonant. Although there are no instances of the use of in this position before c. 1200, gradually decreased from 88% before 1100 to 57% by 1200. The frequency of remained steady between 47% and 44% until 1400, when it experienced another decrease to 32%. Meanwhile, the use of increased from 4% in the early 13th century, to 20% by the mid-13th century, 38% by the mid 14th century, and 58% by the early 15th century.

== Church Slavonic ==
Similarly to the letter І, the usage of Uk in Church Slavonic orthography was standardised by Meletius Smotrytsky, who assigned the two different forms (monograph and digraph) different functions. The original &quot;оу&quot; form was to be used at the beginning of words (for example, &quot;оучитель&quot;) while the monograph &quot;ꙋ&quot; was to be used in the middle and end of words (for example, &quot;мꙋжъ&quot;, &quot;комꙋ&quot;). Similarly to the rule for &quot;і,&quot; this would be used in most Cyrillic languages until the adoption of the Civil script.

== Representation on computers ==

The letter Uk was first represented in Unicode 1.1.0 as and 0479, (Ѹ ѹ). It was later recognized that the glyph to be used for the letter had not been adequately specified, and it had been represented as either a digraph or monograph letter in different released fonts. There was also the difficulty that in written texts the letter may appear in lowercase (оу), uppercase (Оу), or in all caps (ОУ), which is possible to be used for heading.

To resolve this ambiguity, Unicode 5.1 has deprecated the use of the original code points, introduced U+A64A and A64B, (Ꙋ ꙋ), and recommends composing the digraph with two individual characters +.

Unicode 9.0 has also introduced U+1C82 which can also be used for composing the digraph form (+) and U+1C88 (ᲈ) as a variant of monograph form.

However, the recommended method may cause some text representation problems. The letter У did not originally appear alone in the Old Church Slavonic orthography, and thus its code point was replaced in different Old Slavonic computer fonts with digraph or monograph forms of the Uk or with the tailed form of Izhitsa. Tailed Izhitsa may be used as a part of the digraph, but using the shape of the monograph Uk as a part of the digraph Uk (оꙋ) is incorrect.

The minuscule monograph Uk was used in the Romanian Transitional Alphabet to represent , but due to font restrictions, the Ȣ ligature or Latin gamma are occasionally used instead.

<text>Éric Tappy (19 May 1931 – 11 June 2024) was a Swiss operatic tenor. He performed internationally, both in opera, known as a Mozart tenor, and in concert, especially as the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s Passions. He focused on teaching from 1981. 

Tappy was a member of the Grand Théâtre de Genève from 1962 to 1974, where his wide repertoire included major Mozart roles and world premieres such as Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La Mère coupable&quot;. He has been regarded as legendary for portraying Monteverdi&#x27;s Orfeo, Tamino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; and Debussy&#x27;s Pelléas, with a voice of exemplary clarity and diction.

== Life and career ==
Tappy was born in Lausanne on 19 May 1931, to Constant Albert Tappy, a metal worker, and his wife Cécile Emile née Apothéloz. He received early musical instructions in violin and choral singing from his cousin André Charlet.

After Tappy became a teacher in 1951, he studied voice at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève with Fernando Carpi. He studied further at the Salzburg Mozarteum with Ernst Reichert, at the Conservatorium van Hilversum with Eva Liebenberg, and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. Concert activities began in 1956, and increased when he was awarded a prize in 1958, with concerts in Switzerland and abroad; he therefore abandoned his teaching position in 1959. He first performed the role of the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in Strasbourg in 1959. He created the tenor part in Frank Martin&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Mystère de la Nativité&quot; in Geneva in December 1959.

=== Opera ===
When the Grand Théâtre de Genève was reopened in 1962, Tappy appeared as Count de Lerme in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. He joined the company and performed there for twelve years a wide repertoire, including major Mozart roles and roles in new works such as Martin&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur de Pourceaugnac&quot; and &quot;La Tempête&quot;; he took part in the world premiere of Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La Mère coupable&quot;.

He appeared as a guest internationally, in Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Zoroastre&quot; in Bordeaux and in Paris, in the title role of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; at the Drottningholm Palace Theatre, and as Nerone in &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; at the Staatsoper Hannover. In August 1970, he was impressive as Tamino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; at the Salzburg Festival, followed by the same role and also the title role of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; at the Aix-en-Provence Festival.

After he appeared as Nerone in &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; at the Zürich Opera in 1979, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, alongside Rachel Yakar in the title role, the production was also shown at the Edinbourg Festival and La Scala in Milan, and was filmed. Tappy first appeared at the Royal Opera House in London in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; in 1974.

Tappy retired from the stage in 1981; his last performances on stage were Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Lucio Silla&quot; in Zürich and Nerone at the San Francisco Opera.

=== Teaching ===
After his retirement Tappy worked as stage director and focused on teaching. He founded an opera studio, the Atelier d&#x27;interprétation vocale et dramatique, at the Opéra National de Lyon and directed it. He taught at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève from 1984 to 1999.

===Personal life ===
Tappy was married to Colette Guggenheim in 1953; they had two daughters. He died on 11 June 2024, at the age of 93.

== Recordings ==
Tappy recorded &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; in 1968. He recorded Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; twice, in 1969 a live recording in Geneva conducted by Jean-Marie Auberson, with Erna Spoorenberg, Gérard Souzay, and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, and in 1979 conducted by Armin Jordan, with Yakar, Philippe Huttenlocher, and Chœurs et Orchestre National de L&#x27;Opéra Monte Carlo. A reviewer noted his &quot;fine, lean voice&quot;, more virile and assertive than some colleagues, &quot;powerful in his protestations of love&quot;, but &quot;inclined to turn hard of tone when pushed&quot;. Tappy performed as Tamino in a recording of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; taken in 1980 from the Salzburg Festival performance, alongside Ileana Cotrubaș as Pamina and Zdzisława Donat as the Queen of Night, conducted by James Levine. Tappy was also featured in two films by Ponnelle: &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; in 1979 and &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, alongside Tatiana Troyanos and Carol Neblett, in 1980. He recorded the oratorio &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot; by Berlioz, conducted by Colin Davis, and &quot;Clairières dans le ciel&quot;, a song cycle by Lili Boulanger.

== Awards ==
Tappy was awarded the gold medal of the Drottningholm Theatre for his portrayal of Monteverdi&#x27;s Orfeo in 1966. Two years later he received the Edison Award for his recording of the same role. He became an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994. In 2007 he was awarded the Prix culturel de la Fondation Leenaards and the Médaille d&#x27;or of Lausanne.

<text>The British Rail Class 460 &quot;Juniper&quot; (8-GAT) was a class of electric multiple-unit passenger trains built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1999 and 2001. They were part of Alstom&#x27;s Coradia Juniper family, which also includes Classes and .

For the entirety of their service life they operated Gatwick Express services between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport. Following their withdrawal by Gatwick Express in 2012, the fleet was merged with the mechanically similar Class 458 fleet and extensively rebuilt to form a fleet of 36 units—designated Class 458/5—that are now used by South Western Railway.

==History==
National Express (NX) began operating the Gatwick Express franchise in April 1996, having been awarded a 15-year contract to do so by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising as part of the privatisation of British Rail. The company was required as part of the award to replace the existing Gatwick Express rolling stock, which had already been in service for more than 12 years when National Express had inherited it from British Rail. Accordingly, NX and rolling stock lessor Porterbrook placed an order with Alstom for the construction and delivery of eight eight-car units, enough to run services at 15-minute intervals at peak times.

All eight units, numbered 460001–460008, were manufactured at the former Metro-Cammell works at Washwood Heath in Birmingham, which Alstom had acquired in 1989. Each unit was formed of two motor cars with driver&#x27;s cabs, three intermediate motor cars, and three intermediate trailer cars. One driving car, coded and usually kept at the London end of the train, consisted of a large luggage compartment and a small section of first-class seating, while the other driving car was fitted with standard-class seating throughout. The fibreglass nosecones—which earned the class the nickname &quot;Darth Vaders&quot; among some rail enthusiasts—concealed the anti-climbers and an emergency coupler. One bogie on each motor car was fitted with traction motors.

Delivery of the new units began in 2000, but their entry into service was delayed by a number of defectsparticularly concerning the braking systems, air-conditioning, and Train Management System (TMS) software. Only after an extensive program of repairs and modifications by Alstom did the fleet&#x27;s reliability reach a level sufficient to allow full withdrawal of the ex-BR stock in 2005.

On 22 June 2008 the lease for the Class 460 fleet was transferred to Southern when the standalone Gatwick Express franchise was merged into the Southern-operated South Central franchise, as part of a plan to use Gatwick Express services to provide extra capacity on the Brighton Main Line south of Gatwick Airport. Because the Class 460 fleet was too small to support both the extension to Brighton and the existing 15-minute frequency, Southern leased and refurbished a number of units to work alongside the Junipers when the extended timetable took effect in December 2008.

Following the June 2009 renewal of their contract to operate the South Central franchise, Southern leased and refurbished the remainder of the Class 442 fleet for use on Gatwick Express services. This enabled the gradual withdrawal of the Class 460 fleet, which began in 2010 and was completed by September 2012.

==Conversion to Class 458/5==

South West Trains, operator of the South Western franchise from 1996 to 2017, had been experiencing a considerable shortage of passenger capacity on many of its suburban routes in the years immediately prior to 2012, which it attributed primarily to the fact that passenger numbers had increased dramatically without a corresponding increase in the size of their fleet. The company had suggested to the Department for Transport on at least three occasions that their fleet of units should be enlarged, but had been turned down each time.

Rolling stock lessors Porterbrook, owners of the Class 460 fleet, also owned the fleet of Alstom Juniper units that had been in use with South West Trains since February 2000. As an alternative to ordering new trains for SWT, Porterbrook proposed to enlarge the Class 458 fleet and reconfigure it for suburban services by using vehicles from the now-redundant Class 460 fleet. The process, budgeted at £42 million, would use 30 of the 48 Class 460 intermediate cars to extend each of the original 30 Class 458 units to five cars each, leaving six Class 460 units that had been &quot;reduced&quot; to five cars each. These would be comprehensively rebuilt to match the extended Class 458 units, for a total fleet of 36 five-car units that would be designated Class 458/5. The units of this &quot;new&quot; fleet would be used—either individually or in pairs of ten cars—to provide extra peak-time capacity on suburban services to and from .

The Department for Transport announced in December 2011 that it had accepted the proposal, and an agreement between Porterbrook and South West Trains was signed in January 2012. SWT&#x27;s fleet director noted that while the project was &quot;much more complicated ... than buying new trains&quot;, it was also &quot;significantly cheaper&quot;, and industry observers suggested that Porterbrook also benefited significantly in that it wasn&#x27;t left with the burden of having to find a new user for, or scrapping, the Class 460 fleet.

The primary contract for delivering the project was awarded to Alstom, who appointed Wabtec to perform the conversion work on their behalf. In the first phase of the project, all 48 Class 460 intermediate vehicles were sent to Wabtec&#x27;s Doncaster Works to be rebuilt and refitted. Various items of electrical and mechanical equipment such as compressors and traction motors were rearranged as required depending on whether the vehicle was one of the 30 to be inserted into original Class 458 units, or one of the 18 that would remain in the six Class 460 formations.

At the same time, 12 of the 16 driving vehicles from the Class 460 fleet (all eight DMSOs and four of the eight DMLFOs) were rebuilt by Wabtec subsidiary Brush Traction at their workshops in Loughborough, where their original driver&#x27;s cabs were replaced with newly-fabricated versions that included gangways and Voith automatic couplers of the same types used on and 450 units. The four selected DMLFO vehicles had their luggage compartments converted to additional passenger saloon space, and their roller-shutter external doors were replaced with power-operated plug doors taken from the other four DMLFO vehicles.
Additional modifications included re-gearing the traction motors to reduce the train&#x27;s maximum speed from to , both to reduce the likelihood of overheating when making frequent stops and starts, and because the higher speed was unnecessary on suburban services in any case. New Train Management System (TMS) software was developed to be compatible across the entire Class 458/5 fleet, simplifying maintenance and improving reliability. An Automatic Selective Door Opening (ASDO) system was installed for use at a small number of stations where it was impractical to lengthen platforms. The vehicle interiors were refurbished and reconfigured as standard-class only, with 4-abreast seating and a wider aisle throughout. The units were also repainted into SWT&#x27;s blue livery, matching the Class 450 fleet. 

SWT expected to receive the first two converted Class 460 units in May 2013—in time for them to enter service the following November—but due to delays in production the initial delivery didn&#x27;t take place until October. Following testing and staff training, entry into passenger service was achieved in March 2014. Once the first four ex-460 units had been delivered and accepted for service, SWT were able to start sending original Class 458/0 units for rebuilding. These units received the same modifications as the Class 460 conversions, leaving SWT and Porterbrook with a single mechanically-homogenous Class 458/5 fleet.

Following the conclusion of the conversion project the four Class 460 DMLFO vehicles that had not been rebuilt were stripped for spare parts and later scrapped.

<text>Barr Cola is a cola made from kola nuts by the A.G. Barr company, makers of Irn-Bru. The drink was first released in 1875. It was once called Strike Cola and was popular in Britain&#x27;s fish and chip shops and corner shops. Nowadays, it is still enjoyed by many, but largely overshadowed by the same firm&#x27;s bigger drink Irn-Bru. Barr&#x27;s Cola can be purchased in 250ml bottles, 330ml cans, 500ml bottles, 750ml glass bottles and 2 litre plastic bottles. Barr’s Cola is suitable for vegans. The drink is produced in the A.G. Barr factories in Forfar, Milton Keynes and Cumbernauld. Each factory can produce up to 120,000 cans of Barr&#x27;s Cola (or other Barr flavours) every minute. Barr Cola and its different flavours are sold in the supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda, Morrisons and Iceland. They can also be bought in many smaller establishments throughout the UK.

<doc id="1180038" wikidata="Q607846" url="?curid=1180038" title="Jacques-Nicolas Bellin">
<text>Jacques Nicolas Bellin (; 1703 – 21 March 1772) was a French hydrographer, geographer, and member of the French intellectual group called the philosophes.

Bellin was born in Paris. He was hydrographer of France&#x27;s hydrographic office, member of the &quot;Académie de Marine&quot; and of the Royal Society of London. Over a 50-year career, he produced many maps of particular interest to the &quot;Ministère de la Marine&quot;. His maps of Canada and of French territories in North America (New France, Acadia, Louisiana) are particularly valuable. He died at Versailles.

==First &quot;Ingenieur de la Marine&quot;==

In 1721, at age 18, he was appointed hydrographer (chief cartographer) to the French Navy. In August 1741, he became the first &quot;Ingénieur de la Marine of the Dépot des cartes et plans de la Marine&quot; (the French Hydrographical Office) and was named Official Hydrographer of the French King.

==Prodigious work, high standard of excellence==

During his reign the Depot published a prodigious number of charts and maps, among which were large folio-format sea-charts of France, the &quot;Neptune Francois&quot;. He also produced a number of sea-atlases of the world, e.g., the &quot;Atlas Maritime&quot; and the &quot;Hydrographie Francaise&quot;. These gained fame, distinction and respect all over Europe and were republished throughout the 18th and even in the succeeding century.

Bellin also created smaller format maps such as the &quot;1764 Petit Atlas Maritime&quot; (5 vols.) containing 580 finely detailed charts.

Bellin set a very high standard of workmanship and accuracy thus gaining for France a leading role in European cartography and geography. Many of his maps were copied by other mapmakers of Europe.

==Member of philosophes==

He was one of the Encyclopédistes, a group of 18th century intellectuals in France who compiled the 35-volume Encyclopédie which was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. Bellin contributed 994 articles.

The Encyclopédistes, were part of the group called &quot;philosophes&quot; among whose members were the great minds of the Age of Enlightenment, e.g., Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Baron d&#x27;Holbach.

==Innocent party to a geographical error==
Bellin contributed a number of maps to 15-vol. &quot;Histoire Générale des Voyages&quot; of Antoine François Prévost or simply known l&#x27;Abbé Prevost. One of these maps led to a geographical blunder whose impact reverberates to this day. This was the map of the Philippines which Bellin copied from a world-famous chart produced in 1734 by the Spanish missionary to the Philippines, Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde.

Unlike many other European mapmakers of the time who outright appropriated Murillo&#x27;s map, Bellin had the intellectual integrity to fully credit Murillo as his source, an open acknowledgement shown in the title cartouche of Bellin&#x27;s map which came out the same year as the original work by Murillo.

Shown in Bellin&#x27;s map was an island named &quot;Limasava&quot;, a word invented in 1667 by Spanish friar, Fr. Francisco Combés, S.J., to refer to the way station of the Armada de Molucca under the command of the Portuguese captain-general Fernao de Magalhaes during its navigation in Philippine waters. Combés, who had not read a single eyewitness account of the Magellan expedition relied on two sources, the hopelessly garbled Italian translation of the Antonio Pigafetta account by Giovanni Battista Ramusio and the secondhand account by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas. Ramusio wrote the fleet anchored in March–April 1521 in Butuan in Mindanao, and from there sailed for Cebu with a brief stopover at &quot;Messana&quot;. In the authentic Pigafetta account, the port was an isle named Mazzaua while the stopover isle was named Gatighan. Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas gave a faithful narration of the Mazzaua anchorage.

Combés disregarded de Herrera&#x27;s version and adopted Ramusio&#x27;s. He wrote that Magellan&#x27;s fleet had anchored at Butuan and from there sailed for Cebu making a stop at a way station he named Limasaua.

Five years earlier than Combés, Fr. Francisco Colín wrote the Armada moored at Butuan from March–April 1521 where Magellan and his men together with the natives celebrated an Easter Sunday mass on 31 March 1521. From Butuan the fleet sailed for Cebu making a brief stop at a way station he called &quot;Dimasaua&quot;, an invented word meaning &quot;this is not the Mazagua of Antonio de Herrera where supposedly an Easter Sunday mass was held which I already said happened in Butuan.&quot;

This episode was projected in the 1734 map made by Murillo who used Combés name, &quot;Limassava&quot; not &quot;Dimasaua&quot; which map Bellin copied.

==Gatighan becomes Limasava==
In 1789, Augustinian Carlo Amoretti, Italian Encyclopedist and librarian of Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, discovered the authentic Italian manuscript of Antonio Pigafetta among the scattered holdings of the library. Here it came out that the port of March–April 1521 was not Butuan but Mazaua. Amoretti, who himself had not read any of five eyewitness reports of the incident including two French versions of Pigafetta&#x27;s account, asserted in a footnote that Mazaua was probably the isle named Limasava in Bellin&#x27;s map, thus interchanging the real port of Mazaua with the way station Gatighan.

Largely with the appearance of the eyewitness account of Ginés de Mafra, the only seaman in Magellan&#x27;s fleet to return to Mazaua, whose testimony reveals a concrete, measurable description of Mazaua, the skein starting from the garbled version of Pigafetta by Ramusio to the mishandling by Combés to Bellin and finally to Amoretti has been unraveled: Pigafetta&#x27;s Gatighan is Bellin&#x27;s Limasava.

<doc id="1180042" wikidata="Q7963442" url="?curid=1180042" title="Wally Moon">
<text>Wallace Wade Moon (April 3, 1930 – February 9, 2018) was an American professional baseball outfielder in Major League Baseball. Moon played his 12-year career in the major leagues for the St. Louis Cardinals (1954–1958) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1959–1965). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Moon was the 1954 National League Rookie of the Year. He was an All-Star for two seasons and a Gold Glove winner one season. Moon batted .295 or more for seven seasons. He led the National League in triples in 1959 and in fielding percentage as a left fielder in 1960 and 1961.

Moon was a three-time World Series champion with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1959, 1963, and 1965.

==Youth==

Moon was named after Wallace Wade, a former college football coach at the University of Alabama and Duke University. From a family of educators, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in administrative education from Texas A&amp;M University in College Station while he was still in the minor leagues. He coached from 1953 to 1954 at Lake City, also in Craighead County, Arkansas.

==Major league career==

In the spring of 1954, the Cardinals told Moon to report to their minor league spring training camp. He ignored the order and reported instead to St. Petersburg with the Cardinals. He said that he would make the team or quit baseball. They let him stay, and by the end of the spring training he replaced Enos Slaughter in the outfield. To make room for him on the roster, St. Louis sent Slaughter to the New York Yankees.

Moon made his major league debut on April 13, 1954. In his first at-bat, despite chants of &quot;We want Slaughter&quot;, he belted a home run against the Chicago Cubs; in the same game Tom Alston became the first African American to play for the Cardinals. Moon finished his rookie season with a .304 batting average, 12 home runs, 76 runs batted in, and career-high numbers in runs (106), hits (193), doubles (29), and stolen bases (18) in 151 games. He earned both the &quot;MLB&quot; Rookie of the Year and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year honors. Almost a unanimous vote, Moon won easily over Ernie Banks, Gene Conley and Hank Aaron.

A fine left fielder with a good arm, Moon also played right field and center as well as first base. He hit a career-high 24 homers in 1957, and made the All-Star team in 1957 and 1959 (two games were played). Twice in his career, Moon compiled double figures in doubles, triples, home runs and stolen bases: 22, 11, 16, 12 in 1956, and 26, 11, 19, 15 in 1959, his first year with the Dodgers.
After the 1958 season, the Cardinals traded Moon to the Dodgers for outfielder Gino Cimoli. Both players were coming off years when they batted below .250; the Cardinals also sent pitcher Phil Paine, who never played for the Dodgers. Moon was initially concerned about batting in the converted Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum because right field was away, making it difficult for a left-handed batter. However, the left field seats were only away, protected by a screen. After consulting with friend and mentor Stan Musial, Moon adjusted his batting stance to emphasize hitting to left. The results were very successful. In his first season with the Dodgers, the team won the World Championship. Moon provided support in the lineup for Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and Don Demeter. He gained quick public acclaim in 1959 for the &quot;Moon shots&quot; that he hit over the high left field screen. Moon hit a home run in the sixth and final game of that World Series, which the Dodgers won over the Chicago White Sox. He also caught Luis Aparicio&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of the Series.

Moon was a Gold Glove Award winner for left field in 1960 leading National League left fielders in assists, double plays, and fielding percentage. He had another good season in 1961, batting .328 with 17 home runs and 88 runs batted in while leading National League left fielders in fielding percentage.

A career .289 hitter, Moon hit 142 home runs with 661 runs batted in during 1457 games, with a .371 on-base percentage and a .445 slugging average for a combined .816 on-base plus slugging percentage. His career fielding percentage at all three outfield positions and first base was .980. He also scored the last run ever in the Coliseum. He retired as a player after the 1965 season.

==Post-playing career==

In 1969, Moon was a batting coach for the San Diego Padres, joining manager Preston Gómez and pitching coach and former teammate Roger Craig.

In the mid-70s Moon was an instructor at the Sho-Me baseball camp owned by the Kansas City Royals, located in Branson, Missouri.

Moon went on to become athletic director and baseball coach at John Brown University, and a coach and minor league manager and owner of the San Antonio Dodgers for four years beginning in the late 1970s.

Moon managed the minor-league Frederick Keys, a Carolina League affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, in 1990 and 1991.

Moon moved to Bryan, Texas, where he lived for over 25 years. He retired in 1998. He was married to Bettye and had five children and seven grandchildren.

Moon is featured on many websites featuring baseball cards, as he sported a prominent unibrow.

The January 27, 1960, episode (&quot;The Larry Hanify Story&quot;) of the popular TV western &quot;Wagon Train&quot; featured Moon in a brief role. The end credits included: &quot;And Introducing Wally Moon as Sheriff Bender.&quot; There was no baseball tie-in with his character, but the sheriff was hit by a bullet during a shoot-out with Tommy Sands&#x27; bad guy.

Moon died on February 9, 2018, at the age of 87.

<text>Dayton Allen (born Dayton Allen Bolke; September 24, 1919 – November 11, 2004) was an American comedian and voice actor. He was one of the &quot;men in the street&quot; on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. His catchphrase was &quot;Why not, Bubbe?&quot; (pronounced &quot;whooooyyy not!&quot;)

==Early life==
Allen was born in New York City, the son of Helen and Sol Bolke, a dress manufacturer. His younger brother, Bradley Bolke, had some limited success as a voice actor, often appearing in supporting roles alongside Allen. He grew up in Mount Vernon, New York, where he graduated from A.B. Davis High School in June 1936. One of his school friends was Art Carney.

== Career ==
Allen, like Carney, began his career in radio. In 1937–1938 WINS (AM) hired him as a disc jockey.

He was the voice of various New York-based children&#x27;s television show characters, appearing on &quot;Winky Dink and You&quot; as Mr. Bungle for five years, and playing Phineas T. Bluster, Flub-a-Dub, and various other puppet characters on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; (as well as several &quot;live&quot; characters, including Ugly Sam and Pierre the Chef) for four years. Dayton was also the voice of Deputy Dawg, Heckle and Jeckle, Luno, and many early 1960s Terrytoons cartoon characters. Allen also provided the voice of the title character on &quot;Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp&quot;. He continued to be a voiceover performer through the 1990s.

He was best known as the &quot;Why Not?&quot; man when he joined the cast of the NBC Sunday night variety show that Allen began hosting to compete against Ed Sullivan on CBS. The catchphrase began as a stalling ad-lib to an interview question, then it caught on. Allen used it for television commercials and saw novelty toys, a book, and a record spin-off from the &quot;Why not?&quot; phenomenon. In its day, fans were shouting &quot;Why not?&quot; as often as &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;&#x27;s famous &quot;What? Me Worry?&quot; A classic example of Allen&#x27;s humor comes from an August 1968 appearance on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, syndicated nationally in the US by Filmways: &quot;Did you know your mind alone can make you smart?&quot;

His brother, Bradley Bolke, was also a voice actor, best known as the voice of Chumley (Tennessee Tuxedo&#x27;s walrus sidekick) on &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot;, and the syndicated version of &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;.

Allen&#x27;s talents as a mimic were showcased in October 1963 when he appeared alongside Groucho Marx on the CBS-TV game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. The show’s panelists had been blindfolded, and all their questions to Groucho were answered instead by Allen doing an accurate Groucho impersonation. Finally, with panelists Bess Myerson, Betsy Palmer, Henry Morgan, and Bill Cullen all stumped, the secret was revealed.

After his show business career ended, Allen was a real estate agent, operating out of an office in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Allen died on November 11, 2004, in Hendersonville, North Carolina, due to complications from a stroke.

<text>The were two battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and , laid down leading up to the Second World War and completed as designed. A third hull, laid down in 1940, was converted to the aircraft carrier during construction.

Displacing nearly at full load, the completed battleships were the heaviest ever constructed. The class carried the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship, nine 460 mm (18.1 in) naval guns, each capable of firing shells over .

Due to the threat of U.S. submarines and aircraft carriers, both &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; spent the majority of their careers in naval bases at Brunei, Truk, and Kure—deploying on several occasions in response to U.S. raids on Japanese bases.

All three ships were sunk by the U.S. Navy; &quot;Musashi&quot; by air strikes while participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, &quot;Shinano&quot; after being torpedoed by the submarine while under way from Yokosuka to Kure for fitting out in November 1944, and &quot;Yamato&quot; by air strikes while en route from Japan to Okinawa as part of Operation Ten-Go in April 1945.

==Background==
The design of the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships was shaped by expansionist movements within the Japanese government, Japanese industrial power, and the need for a fleet powerful enough to intimidate likely adversaries. Most importantly, the latter, in the form of the &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; or Decisive Battle Doctrine, a naval strategy adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy prior to the Second World War, in which the Japanese navy would win a war by fighting and winning a single, decisive naval action.
After the end of the First World War, many navies—including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Imperial Japan—continued and expanded construction programs that had begun during the conflict. The enormous costs associated with these programs pressured their government leaders to begin a disarmament conference. On 8 July 1921, the United States&#x27; Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes invited delegations from the other major maritime powers—France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—to come to Washington, D.C., and discuss a possible end to the naval arms race. The subsequent Washington Naval Conference resulted in the Washington Naval Treaty. Along with many other provisions, it limited all future battleships to a standard displacement of and a maximum gun caliber of . It also agreed that the five countries would not construct more capital ships for ten years and would not replace any ship that survived the treaty until it was at least twenty years old.

In the 1930s, the Japanese government began a shift towards ultranationalist militancy. This movement called for the expansion of the Japanese Empire to include much of the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. The maintenance of such an empire—spanning from China to Midway Island—required a sizable fleet capable of sustained control of territory. Although all of Japan&#x27;s battleships built prior to the &quot;Yamato&quot; class had been completed before 1921—as the Washington Treaty had prevented any more from being completed—all had been either reconstructed or significantly modernized, or both, in the 1930s. This modernization included, among other things, additional speed and firepower, which the Japanese intended to use to conquer and defend their aspired-to empire. When Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934 over the Mukden Incident, it also renounced all treaty obligations, freeing it to build warships larger than those of the other major maritime powers.

Japan&#x27;s intention to acquire resource-producing colonies in the Pacific and Southeast Asia would likely lead to confrontation with the United States, thus the U.S. became Japan&#x27;s primary potential enemy. The U.S. possessed significantly greater industrial power than Japan, with 32.2% of worldwide industrial production compared to Japan&#x27;s 3.5%. Furthermore, several leading members of the United States Congress had pledged &quot;to outbuild Japan three to one in a naval race.&quot; Consequently, as Japanese industrial output could not compete with American industrial power, Japanese ship designers developed plans for new battleships individually superior to their counterparts in the United States Navy. Each of these battleships would be capable of engaging multiple enemy capital ships simultaneously, eliminating the need to expend as much industrial effort as the U.S. on battleship construction.

==Design==

Preliminary studies for a new class of battleships began after Japan&#x27;s departure from the League of Nations and its renunciation of the Washington and London naval treaties; from 1934 to 1936, 24 initial designs were put forth. These early plans varied greatly in armament, propulsion, endurance, and armor. Main batteries fluctuated between and guns, while the secondary armaments were composed of differing numbers of , , and guns. Propulsion in most of the designs was a hybrid diesel-turbine combination, though one relied solely on diesel and another planned for only turbines. The maximum range of the various designs was between in design A-140-J2 to a high of in designs A-140A and A-140-B2, at a speed of . Armor varied between providing protection from the fire of 406 mm guns to enough protection against 460 mm guns.

After these had been reviewed, two of the original twenty-four were finalized as possibilities, A-140-F3 and A-140-F4. Differing primarily in their range ( versus at ), they were used in the formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937, which was put forth by Rear-Admiral Fukuda Keiji; a range of 7,200 nmi was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of turbines. The diesel engines were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the submarine tender &quot;Taigei&quot;. Their engines, which were similar to the ones that were going to be mounted in the new battleships, required a &quot;major repair and maintenance effort&quot; to keep them running due to a &quot;fundamental design defect&quot;. In addition, if the engines failed entirely, the armored citadel deck roof that protected the proposed diesel engine rooms and attendant machinery spaces would severely hamper any attempt to remove and replace them.

The final design called for a standard displacement of and a full-load displacement of , making the ships of the class the largest battleships yet designed, and the largest battleships ever constructed. The design called for a main armament of nine 460 mm naval guns, mounted in three three-gun turrets—each of which weighed more than a 1930s-era destroyer. The designs were quickly approved by the Japanese Naval high command, over the objections of naval aviators, who argued for the construction of aircraft carriers rather than battleships. In all, five &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships were planned.

==Ships==

Although five &quot;Yamato&quot;-class vessels had been planned in 1937, only three—two battleships and a converted aircraft carrier—were completed. All three vessels were built in extreme secrecy, to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications; indeed, the United States&#x27; Office of Naval Intelligence only became aware of &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; by name in late 1942. At this early time, their assumptions on the class&#x27;s specifications were quite far off; while they were correct on their length, the class was given as having a beam of —in actuality, it was about and a displacement of 40,000–57,000 tons (actually, 69,000 tons). In addition, the main armament of &quot;Yamato&quot; class was given as nine guns as late as July 1945, four months after &quot;Yamato&quot; was sunk. Both &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; and the Western media also misreported the specifications of the ships. In September 1944, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; listed the displacement of both &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; as 45,000 tons. Similarly, both the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the Associated Press reported that the two ships displaced 45,000 tons with a speed of 30 knots, and even after the sinking of &quot;Yamato&quot; in April 1945, &quot;The Times&quot; of London continued to give 45,000 tons as the ship&#x27;s displacement. Nevertheless, the existence of the ships—and their supposed violation of naval treaties—heavily influenced American naval engineers in the design of the 60,500-ton s, though they were not designed specifically to counter the &quot;Yamato&quot; class.

===&quot;Yamato&quot;===
 was ordered in March 1937, laid down 4 November 1937, launched 8 August 1940, and commissioned 16 December 1941. She underwent training exercises until 27 May 1942, when the vessel was deemed &quot;operable&quot; by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Joining the 1st Battleship Division, &quot;Yamato&quot; served as the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, yet did not engage enemy forces during the battle. The next two years were spent intermittently between Truk and Kure naval bases, with her sister ship &quot;Musashi&quot; replacing &quot;Yamato&quot; as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. During this time period, &quot;Yamato&quot;, as part of the 1st Battleship Division, deployed on multiple occasions to counteract American carrier-raids on Japanese island bases. On 25 December 1943, she suffered major torpedo damage at the hands of and was forced to return to Kure for repairs and structural upgrades.

In 1944—following extensive anti-aircraft and secondary battery upgrades—&quot;Yamato&quot; joined the Second Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, serving as an escort to a Japanese Carrier Division. In October 1944, as part of Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, she used her naval artillery against an enemy vessel for the only time, helping sink the American escort carrier and the destroyer before she was forced away by torpedoes from , which put her out of combat. Lightly damaged at Kure in March 1945, the ship was then rearmed in preparation for operations. &quot;Yamato&quot; was deliberately expended in a suicide mission as part of Operation Ten-Go,
sent to use her big guns to provide relief to Japanese forces engaged in the Battle of Okinawa. While en-route she was sunk on 7 April 1945 by 386 American carrier aircraft. After receiving 10 torpedo and 7 bomb hits she capsized, taking 2,498 of the 2,700 crew-members with her, including Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō. The sinking of &quot;Yamato&quot; was seen as a major American victory, and Hanson W. Baldwin, the military editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;the sinking of the new Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; ... is striking proof—if any were needed—of the fatal weakness of Japan in the air and at sea&quot;.

=== &quot;Musashi&quot; ===
 was ordered in March 1937, laid down 29 March 1938, launched 1 November 1940, and commissioned 5 August 1942. From September to December 1942, she was involved in surface and air-combat training exercises at Hashirajima. On 11 February 1943, &quot;Musashi&quot; relieved her sister ship &quot;Yamato&quot; as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. Until July 1944, &quot;Musashi&quot; shifted between the naval bases of Truk, Yokosuka, Brunei, and Kure. On 29 March 1944, she sustained moderate damage near the bow from one torpedo fired by the American submarine . After repairs and refitting throughout April 1944, &quot;Musashi&quot; joined the 1st Battleship Division in Okinawa.

In June 1944, as part of the Second Fleet, the ship escorted Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In October 1944, she left Brunei as part of Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk 24 October during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, taking 17 bomb and 19 torpedo hits, with the loss of 1,023 of her 2,399-man crew.

=== &quot;Shinano&quot; ===
&quot;Shinano&quot;, originally Warship Number 110, was laid down as the third member of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class, albeit with a slightly modified design. Most of the original armor values were slightly reduced, including the belt, deck, and turrets. The savings in weight this entailed meant that improvements could be made in other areas, including added protection for fire-control and lookout positions. In addition, the secondary armament on the first two &quot;Yamato&quot;s was to have been replaced by the /65 caliber Type 98 gun. Although smaller, this gun was superior to the 127 mm, possessing a significantly greater muzzle velocity, maximum range, anti-aircraft ceiling, and rate of fire.

In June 1942, following the Japanese defeat at Midway, construction of &quot;Shinano&quot; was suspended, and the hull was gradually rebuilt as an aircraft carrier. She was designed as a 64,800-ton support vessel that would be capable of ferrying, repairing and replenishing the air fleets of other carriers. Although she was originally scheduled for commissioning in early 1945, the construction of the ship was accelerated after the Battle of the Philippine Sea; this resulted in &quot;Shinano&quot; being launched on 5 October 1944 and commissioned a little more than a month later on 19 November. &quot;Shinano&quot; departed Yokosuka for Kure nine days later. In the early morning on 29 November, &quot;Shinano&quot; was hit by four torpedoes from . Although the damage seemed manageable, poor flooding control caused the vessel to list to starboard. Shortly before midday, she capsized and sank, taking 1,435 of her 2,400-man crew with her. To this day, &quot;Shinano&quot; is the largest naval vessel to have been sunk by a submarine.

=== Warships Number 111 and 797 ===
Warship Number 111, never named, was planned as the fourth member of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class and the second ship to incorporate the improvements of &quot;Shinano&quot;. The ship&#x27;s keel was laid after &quot;Yamato&quot;″s launch in August 1940 and construction continued until December 1941, when the Japanese began to question their ambitious capital ship building program—with the coming of war, the resources essential in constructing the ship would become much harder to obtain. As a result, the hull of the fourth vessel, only about 30% complete, was taken apart and scrapped in 1942; materials from this were used in the conversions of and to hybrid battleship/aircraft carriers.

The fifth vessel, Warship Number 797, was planned as an improved &quot;Shinano&quot; but was never laid down. In addition to the modifications made to that ship, 797 would have removed the two wing turrets in favor of additional 100 mm guns; authors William Garzke and Robert Dulin estimate that this would have allowed for 24 of these weapons. &quot;Yamato&quot; was eventually modified in 1944 to something akin to this.

== Specifications ==

=== Armaments ===

==== Primary armament ====

The &quot;Yamato-&quot;class battleships had primary armaments consisting of three 3-gun turrets mounting /45 caliber Type 94 naval guns – the largest guns ever fitted to a warship, although they were officially designated as the 40 cm/45 caliber (15.9 in) Type 94 – each of which weighed 2,774 tonnes for the complete mount. Each gun was long and weighed , and could fire armor-piercing shells and high explosive shells out to at a rate of 1½ to 2 shells per minute.

The main guns were also capable of firing &quot;3 Shiki tsûjôdan&quot; (&quot;Common Type 3&quot;) anti-aircraft shells. A time fuze was used to set how far away the shells would explode (although they were commonly set to go off away). Upon detonation, each of these shells would release 900 incendiary-filled tubes in a 20° cone facing towards incoming aircraft; a bursting charge was then used to explode the shell itself to create more steel splinters, finally, the tubes would ignite. The tubes would burn for five seconds at about and would start a flame that was around long. Even though they comprised 40% of the total main ammunition load by 1944, &quot;3 Shiki tsûjôdan&quot; were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns; indeed, one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of &quot;Musashi&quot;″s guns during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. The shells were intended to put up a barrage of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through. However, U.S. pilots considered these shells to be more of a pyrotechnics display than a competent anti-aircraft weapon.


==== Secondary armament ====
In the original design, the &quot;Yamato&quot; class&#x27; secondary armament comprised twelve 15.5 cm/60 Type 3 guns mounted in four 3-gun turrets (one forward, two amidships, one aft), and twelve 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 guns in six double turrets (three on each side amidships). These had become available once the &quot;Mogami&quot;-class cruisers were rearmed with  guns. With a AP shell, the guns had a maximum range of at an elevation of 45 degrees. Their rate of fire was five rounds per minute. The two midships turrets were removed in 1944 in favor of additional heavy and light anti-aircraft guns.

Initially, heavy anti-aircraft defence was provided by a dozen 40-caliber 127-mm Type 89 dual-purpose guns in six double turrets, three on each side of the superstructure. In 1944, the two amidship 15.5 cm turrets were removed to make room for three additional 127-mm mounts on each side of &quot;Yamato&quot;, bringing the total number of these guns to twenty-four . When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute; their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.

==== Anti-aircraft armament ====
The &quot;Yamato&quot; class originally carried twenty-four 25 mm Type 96 anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships. In 1944, both &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; underwent significant anti-aircraft upgrades in preparation for operations in Leyte Gulf using the space freed up by the removal of both midships secondary battery turrets, and ended up with a complement of twenty-four guns, and one hundred and sixty-two antiaircraft guns, The 25 mm anti-aircraft guns could tilt at 90-degree angles to aim at planes directly overhead, but their mountings&#x27; lack of protection made their gunnery crews extremely vulnerable to direct enemy fire. These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II; it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and ... the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;.

The class was also provided with two twin mounts for the licence-built 13.2 mm Type 93 anti-aircraft machine guns, one on each side of the bridge. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was only . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute; the need to change 30-round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The armament on &quot;Shinano&quot; was quite different from that of her sister vessels due to her conversion. As the carrier was designed for a support role, significant anti-aircraft weaponry was installed on the vessel: sixteen guns, one hundred forty-five anti-aircraft guns, and three hundred and thirty-six anti-aircraft rocket launchers in twelve twenty-eight barrel turrets. None of these guns were ever used against an enemy vessel or aircraft.

=== Armor ===
Designed to engage multiple enemy battleships simultaneously, the &quot;Yamato&quot;s were fitted with heavy armor plating described by naval historian Mark Stille as providing &quot;an unparalleled degree of protection in surface combat&quot;. The main belt of armor along the side of the vessel was up to thick, with transverse bulkheads of the armoured citadel up to thick. A lower belt armor thick extending below the main belt was included in the ships as a response to gunnery experiments upon and the new Japanese Type 91 shell which could travel great lengths underwater. Furthermore, the top hull shape was very advanced, the peculiar sideways curving effectively maximizing armor protection and structural rigidity while optimizing weight. The armor on the main turrets surpassed even that of the main belt, with turret face plating thick. Armor plates in both the main belt and main turrets were made of Vickers Hardened steel, which was a face-hardened steel armor. Main armored deck— thick—was composed of a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy. Ballistics tests at the proving ground at Kamegakubi demonstrated the deck alloy to be superior to the homogeneous Vickers plates by 10–15%. Additional plating was designed by manipulating the chromium and nickel composition of the alloy. Higher contents of nickel allowed the plate to be rolled and bent without developing fracture properties.

For torpedo protection, a multiple bulkhead side protection system was used which consisted of several void spaces as well as the lower belt armor; the system has a depth of and was designed to withstand a TNT charge. No torpedo defense system compartments were liquid loaded, despite the known benefits. This may have been the result of overestimating the effectiveness of the lower belt armor against torpedoes, an effort to decrease draft, and provision of additional counter-flooding spaces.

The relatively new procedure of arc welding was used extensively throughout the ship, strengthening the durability of the armor plating. Through this technique, the lower-side belt armor was used to strengthen the hull structure of the entire vessel. In total, the vessels of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class contained 1,147 watertight compartments, of which 1,065 were beneath the armored deck. The ships were also designed with a very large amount of reserve buoyancy to mitigate the effects of flooding.

However, despite the immense armor thickness, the protection scheme of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings. Structural weakness existed near the bow of the vessels, where the armor plating was generally thinner, as demonstrated by &quot;Musashi&#x27;s&quot; damage from a torpedo hit in 1943. The hull of the &quot;Shinano&quot; was subject to even greater structural weakness, being hastily constructed near the end of the war and having been equipped with incomplete armor and unsealed watertight compartments at the time of her sinking. The torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed. In particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armor created a rupture-prone seam just below the waterline. When combined with the relatively shallow system depth and the lack of liquid loading, this caused the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Joint failures have been attributed to the considerable damage inflicted upon &quot;Yamato&quot; from a single torpedo impact in 1943, and to the sinking of &quot;Shinano&quot; from four hits in 1944.

=== Propulsion ===
The &quot;Yamato&quot; class was fitted with 12 Kampon boilers, which powered quadruple steam turbines, with an indicated horsepower of 147,948 (). These, in turn, drove four propellers. This powerplant enabled the &quot;Yamato&quot; class to achieve a top speed of . With this speed, the &quot;Yamato&quot; class&#x27; ability to function alongside fast carriers was limited. In addition, the fuel consumption rate of both battleships was very high. As a result, neither battleship was used in combat during the Solomon Islands Campaign or the minor battles during the &quot;island hopping&quot; period of 1943 and early 1944. The propulsion system of &quot;Shinano&quot; was slightly improved, allowing the carrier to achieve a top speed of .

== &quot;Super &quot;Yamato&quot;&quot;-class battleships ==

Two battleships of an entirely new and larger design were planned as a part of the 1942 fleet replenishment program. Designated as Design A-150 and initially named Warship Number 178 and Warship Number 179, plans for the ships began soon after the design of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class was finished, probably in 1938–39. Everything was &quot;essentially completed&quot; sometime in 1941, but with war on the horizon, work on the battleships was halted to fill a need for additional warships, such as aircraft carriers and cruisers, to replace war losses of those vital ships. The Japanese loss in the Battle of Midway, where four carriers were sunk (out of ten, at that time, in the entire navy), made it certain that work on the ships would never begin. In the third volume of their &quot;Battleships&quot; series, &quot;Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II&quot;, the authors William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin asserted that these ships would have been the &quot;most powerful battleships in history&quot; because of their massive main battery and extensive anti-aircraft weaponry.

Similar to the fate of papers relating to the &quot;Yamato&quot; class, most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed to prevent capture at the end of the war. It is known that the final design of the ships would have had an even greater firepower and size than the &quot;Yamato&quot; class—a main battery of six guns in three turrets and secondary dual purpose armament consisting of twenty-four dual mounted guns (similar to the s). The displacement was to be bigger than the &quot;Yamato&quot;″s, and a side armor belt of was planned.

==Destruction of records==
On the eve of the Allies&#x27; occupation of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the &quot;Yamato&quot; class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan&#x27;s surrender.

However, in October 1942, based upon a special request from Adolf Hitler, German Admiral Paul Wenneker, attached to the German Naval Attache in Japan, was allowed to inspect a &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleship while it was undergoing maintenance in a dockyard, at which time Admiral Wenneker cabled a detailed description of the warship to Berlin. On 22 August 1943, Erich Groner, a German naval historian, and author of the book &quot;Die Deutschen Kriegschiffe, 1815–1945&quot;, was shown the report while at the &quot;Führer Headquarters&quot;, and was directed to make an &quot;interpretation&quot; and then prepare a &quot;design sketch drawing&quot; of the Japanese battleship. The material was preserved by Erich Groner&#x27;s wife, Mrs. H. Groner, and submitted to publishers in the 1950s.

== Cultural significance ==

From the time of their construction until the present day, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; have carried a notable presence in Japanese culture, &quot;Yamato&quot; in particular. Upon completion, the battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering. In addition, the two ships, due to their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan&#x27;s determination and readiness to defend its interests against the western powers, especially the United States. Shigeru Fukudome, chief of the Operations Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, described the two ships as &quot;symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.&quot;

&quot;Yamato&quot;, and especially the story of her sinking, has appeared often in Japanese popular culture, such as the anime &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; and the 2005 film &quot;Yamato&quot;. The appearances in popular culture usually portray the ship&#x27;s last mission as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One of the reasons that the warship may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word &quot;Yamato&quot; was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; could serve as a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.

<text>Menumorut or Menumorout (Modern ) was the ruler of the lands between the rivers Mureș, Someș and Tisza at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 900, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, a Hungarian chronicle written after 1150 by an unidentified author, referred to as Anonymus. Historians debate whether Menumorut was an actual ruler or a fictional character created by the author, since the &quot;Gesta&quot; tells of multiple figures, including Menumorut, who are not identified in any other primary sources, and does not name any of the enemies of the invading Hungarians written of in other contemporary accounts of the invasion. According to Anonymus, Menumorut&#x27;s duchy was populated primarily with Khazars and Székelys, and he acknowledged the suzerainty of the (unnamed) ruling Byzantine Emperor at the time.

The most important source of the Magyars&#x27; early history is a work known as &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, written by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII around 952. According to the emperor, the Magyars &quot;lived together with&quot; the Khazars &quot;for three years, and fought in alliance&quot; with them for an unspecified time. The text suggests that the Magyars were once subjected to the Khazar Khaganate, the dominant power of the lands between the rivers Dnieper and Volga, but modern historians debate whether their subjection lasted only for a couple of years, as the emperor states, or for a longer period. In the same area, three or four local variants of the Saltovo-Mayaki archaeological culture, which represented semi-nomadic groups, emerged in the western regions of the Eurasian steppes in the second half of the 8th century.

Internal strife and attacks by neighboring tribes caused the decline of the Khaganate in the early 9th century. The Magyars were among the Khazars&#x27; subject peoples who seceded, settling in the Pontic steppes to the north of the Black Sea. According to Emperor Constantine VII, the Kabars, who &quot;were of the race&quot; of the Khazars, also rebelled against the Khaganate and joined the Magyars. This event occurred before 881, because in that year the Magyars and the Kabars invaded East Francia, according to the longer version of the &quot;Annals of Salzburg&quot;. The Magyars also intervened in a war between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire on the latter&#x27;s behalf in about 894. The Bulgarians formed an alliance with the Pechenegs, who dwelled in the lands east of the Magyars, and they jointly invaded the Pontic steppes and defeated the Magyars, forcing them to move to the Carpathian Basin in search for a new homeland.

Their conquest of the Carpathian Basin is the principal subject of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. The &quot;Gesta&quot; was written after 1150 by an unidentified author, who is referred to as Anonymus in modern scholars&#x27; works. He wrote primarily of the Magyars&#x27; battles with six local rulers, including Menumorut, who are not named in other annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Luitpold of Bavaria, and other local rulers whose fights with the conquering Magyars were described in late 9th-century or early 10th-century sources.

===Crișana on the eve of the Hungarian Conquest===
Burial sites unearthed at Valea lui Mihai and other sites along the Ier River containing remains of horses show that the Avars settled in Crișana shortly after their arrival in the Carpathian Basin in 567. However, few belt mounts decorated with griffins and tendrils or other such features of later Avar craftsmanship have been found in the same region. A distinct group of barrow cemeteries, or &quot;tumuli&quot;the so-called &quot;Nușfalău–Someșeni&quot; cemeteriesappeared in the lands bordering on &quot;Late Avar&quot; cemeteries in the 8th century. In contrast with the Avars, who practised inhumation, the populations using these cemeteries cremated their dead. &quot;Nușfalău–Someșeni&quot; cemeteries show similarities to some in the East Slavic territories, but they yielded items similar to examples unearthed in West Slavic sites and to &quot;Late Avar&quot; belt mounts.

The Avars&#x27; power collapsed after Charlemagne and his commanders launched a series of campaigns against the western regions of the Carpathian Basin between 788 and 803. However, Avar groups survived the destruction of their empire: Regino of Prüm wrote that the Magyars first &quot;roamed the wildernesses of the Pannonians and the Avars&quot; in the Carpathian Basin after their flight from the Pontic steppes. According to historian András Róna-Tas, these wildernesses of the Avars &quot;(solitudo Avarorum)&quot; were situated in the plains along the rivers Tisza and Danube, including Crișana.

The collapse of the Avar Khaganate enabled the development of &quot;Great&quot; Moravia, a Slavic polity which emerged in the region of the Middle Danube. Svatopluk I of Moravia, who reigned from 870 to 894, expanded his authority over a large region. Svatopluk&#x27;s empire included Crişana, according to historian Gyula Kristó, since Emperor Constantine&#x27;s reference to &quot;great Moravia, the unbaptized&quot; describes the rivers Timiș, Mureș, Criș, Tisza and Toutis as within its territory. Archaeologist rejects Kristó&#x27;s theory, because no archaeological finds from the late 9th century evidence Moravian influence in Crișana.

The Bulgarians also benefited from the fall of the Avar Khaganate. One of the military commanders of Omurtag of Bulgaria drowned in the Tisza, showing that Omurtag, who ruled between 814 and 831, attempted to expand his authority towards this river. The Bulgarians allied with the Franks and invaded Moravia in both 863 and 883. Based on sources from around 870, the Persian scholar Gardizi wrote of two peoples, the Nandarin and the Mirdāt, whose lands were ten days&#x27; journey apart. Historians István Bóna and György Györffy identify the Nandarins as Bulgarians (because &quot;nándor&quot; was the Hungarian exonym for the Bulgarians), and the Mirdāt as Moravians. If their identifications are valid, the distance between Bulgaria and Moravia was about circa 870.

==Anonymus&#x27;s narration==

===Menumorut and his duchy===

Menumorut ruled an area bordered by the rivers Tisza, Mureș, Someș, and the Igyfon Wood at the time of the Magyars&#x27; invasion, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. Anonymus also wrote that &quot;the peoples that are called Kozár&quot;, identified by historians as Khazars, inhabited this realm, together with the Székelys. Menumorut&#x27;s main fortress was located at Biharia, according to Anonymus. An early medieval fortress was found here, and some historians (including Sălăgean) have identified it as Menumorut&#x27;s capital, although others (for instance, Florin Curta) argue that nothing proves that the fortress was built before the 10th century. Anonymus wrote that Menumorut was the grandson of one &quot;Prince Marót&quot; (whose name was derived from the ancient Hungarian exonym for the Moravians), who he states was ruler of Crișana in the times of Attila the Hun. According to the &quot;Gesta&quot;, Menumorut communicated &quot;haughtily with a Bulgarian heart&quot; with the Magyars&#x27; envoys, informing them that &quot;the emperor of Constantinople&quot; was his lord.

The &quot;Gesta&quot; describes Menumorut as a polygamist, stating that he &quot;had many concubines&quot;. Anonymus even suggested that Menumorut&#x27;s name was connected to the Hungarian word for stallion &quot;(mén)&quot; because of his womanizing nature. According to historian Neagu Djuvara, Menumorut&#x27;s name is a Hungarian form of a Turkic (possibly Bulgar) proper name, but he does not give a suggestion.

===The Hungarian conquest===
The Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin through the Northern Carpathians, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. After conquering the northeastern region, their leader, Grand Prince Árpád, sent two envoys, Ősbő and Velek, to Menumorut, demanding &quot;the land from the Someș River to the border of Nyírség, up to the Meseș Gates&quot;. Menumorut received Árpád&#x27;s envoys amicably, but refused to yield, stating that the Byzantine Emperor guaranteed him rule over the land. Ősbő and Velek returned to Árpád and informed him of Menumorut&#x27;s refusal.

Árpád dispatched three commanders, Tas, Szabolcs, and Tétény, to invade Menumorut&#x27;s duchy, according to Anonymus. They crossed the Tisza &quot;at the ford of Lád&quot; and marched towards the Someș. They halted at a place near the future village of Szabolcs, where &quot;almost all the inhabitants of the land surrendered of their own will&quot;, giving their sons as hostages to them. Menomorut did not dare to launch a counter-attack, since more and more of his subjects were voluntarily yielding to the Magyar leaders. Upon Szabolcs&#x27;s orders, an earthen fortress was built, which was named after him, and the three Magyar commanders &quot;appointed from among the inhabitants of the land many serving men to that castle&quot; and manned the fortress with Magyar warriors under the command of a lieutenant.

After this, Anonymus continues, a division of the Magyar army advanced towards the Meseș Gates, under the command of Szabolcs and Tas, and occupied the fortress of Satu Mare, while a second division, led by Tétény, &quot;conquered a great number of people&quot; in the Nyírség. The two divisions rejoined at the Meseș Gates, where &quot;the dwellers of the land built stone gateways and a great obstacle of trees&quot; in accordance with the Magyar leaders&#x27; orders to defend the borders of their newly conquered lands. Anonymus emphasizes that the three Magyar commanders were very proud that &quot;they had subjected almost all the nations&quot; of Menumorut&#x27;s duchy. Tas and Szabolcs decided to return to Árpád, &quot;subduing the whole people from the Someș River to the Criș River&quot; on their way. Menumorut was at this point planning to escape to the Byzantine Empire, but his warriors prevented Szabolcs and Tas from crossing the Criş at Szeghalom, thus forcing the Magyars to temporarily retreat.

After the first campaign against Menumorut, the Magyars fought with Salan (who was the lord of the lands between the Tisza and the Danube), with the Bohemians, and with Glad (the lord of the Banat), and conquered Pannonia, according to the &quot;Gesta&quot;. Árpád once again dispatched Ősbő and Velek, at the head of a new army, against Menumorut&#x27;s remaining lands after the birth of his son, Zoltán. Ősbő and Velek crossed the Tisza and halted at the river Kórógy, where the Székelys, &quot;who were previously the peoples&quot; of Attila the Hun, according to Anonymus, voluntarily joined them. Their united armies crossed the Criş River and encamped on the banks of one of its tributaries. Their arrival frightened Menumorut, who left &quot;a host of warriors&quot; in Biharia and &quot;betook himself and his wife and daughter to the groves&quot; of the Igyfon Wood. Ősbő and Velek laid siege to Biharia, which was defended by &quot;warriors gathered from diverse nations&quot;, for twelve days. During the siege, twenty Magyar, fifteen Székely warriors, and 125 of Menumorut&#x27;s soldiers were killed. On the 13th day, after the besiegers made preparations for putting ladders to the wall, the defenders decided to surrender, and opened the gates of the fortress.

Having been informed of the fall of his capital, Anonymus continues, Menumorut surrendered and agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán. Árpád accepted this offer, allowing Menumorut to continue his rule over Biharia till the end of his life. Árpád &quot;gave the county of Zaránd&quot; to Velek, and the fortress of Veszprém to Ősbő, in reward for their services during the war against Menumorut. Menumorut &quot;died without a son&quot; not long before 907, leaving &quot;his whole kingdom in peace&quot; to his son-in-law, Zoltán.

==Assesment of Historians==

Many historians debate the reliability of the reports of the &quot;Gesta&quot; concerning Menumorut and the other opponents of the Magyars who are not named in other primary sources. Kristó writes that Anonymus, who had little information of the real conditions of the Carpathian Basin around 900, could only turn &quot;to one thing when he outlined the history of the Hungarian conquest: his own imagination,&quot; and György Györffy says that Menumorut was one of the personalities whom Anonymus invented and named after a location. The existence of two villages named &quot;Morut&#x27;s house&quot; (&quot;Marótlaka&quot; in Hungarian) and a clan Morut in Bihar County in the 13th century is well-documented, proving that at least one Morut had settled in this region. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the majority of events that the &quot;Gesta&quot; mentions in connection with Menumorut are &quot;a simple repetition, with variants&quot; of the story of Salan in the same chronicle, showing that Anonymus &quot;had little material on which to work&quot; when writing about Menumorut. Historian says that Menumorut &quot;never existed and never ruled over Bihar&quot;, but &quot;it was not an invented person&quot;.

==History==
Lew Addison Cummings and Melbourne Wesley Cummings founded Addison–Wesley in 1942, with the first book published by Addison–Wesley being Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Francis Weston Sears&#x27; &quot;Mechanics&quot;.

Its first computer book was &quot;Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer&quot;, by Wilkes, Wheeler, and Gill. In 1977, Addison–Wesley acquired W. A. Benjamin Company, and merged it with the Cummings division of the company to form Benjamin Cummings. It was purchased by the global publishing and education company Pearson PLC in 1988 and became part of Addison Wesley Longman in 1994. The trade publishing division of Addison–Wesley was sold to Perseus Books Group in 1997, leaving Addison–Wesley as solely an educational publisher. Pearson acquired the educational division of Simon &amp; Schuster in 1998, and merged it with Addison Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education and subsequently rebranded to Pearson in 2011. Pearson moved the former Addison Wesley Longman offices from Reading, Massachusetts, to Boston in 2004. Its current executives hail from the original Addison–Wesley with a storied history of their own.

<doc id="1180091" wikidata="Q5632221" url="?curid=1180091" title="HMS Dulverton (L63)">
<text>HMS &quot;Dulverton&quot; was a Type II of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1941, she saw service during the Second World War until being damaged by German aircraft in 1943 during the Battle of Leros, and was scuttled. The Commander during her last battle was Stuart Austen Buss, MVO, DSC, RN. He did not survive.

&quot;Dulverton&quot; was ordered from Alexander Stephen and Sons of Govan on the outbreak of war in 1939. She was laid down on 16 July 1940, and launched 1 April 1941. She was completed by September 1941.

==Service history==
&quot;Dulverton&quot; participated in many operations, including escorting troop convoys bound for Suez Canal and the convoys to Malta including the first one to lift the siege there, supporting the British Eighth Army in North Africa, the Tobruk Raid, and the destruction of the German submarine with other destroyers and the Royal Air Force.

In October 1943 &quot;Dulverton&quot; was involved in the Dodecanese Campaign, as part of a force that was trying to capture the Greek islands of Kos and Leros on 20 October and again on 4 November. On 12 November, &quot;Dulverton&quot; returned to support the garrison on Leros which had just been invaded by the Germans. On 13 November, whilst five miles off the coast of Kos, she was attacked by German Do 217 E-5 aircraft from KG 100 using Hs 293 glider bombs, one of which struck &quot;Dulverton&quot; abreast of the bridge. Six officers and 114 ratings were evacuated from the ship before she was scuttled by , but three officers including the Captain of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla and 75 ratings were lost.

<text>Samira Abdelrazak Bensaïd (; born 10 January 1958), professionally known as Samira Said (), is a Moroccan-Egyptian singer who has lived in Egypt for more than 40 years and is known for her Egyptian Arabic genre. She represented Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980, and is to date the only Moroccan entrant in the contest.

== Career ==

Samira Said was born in 1958 in Rabat, in Morocco, to a father from Rabat and a mother from Fez. She began singing at the age of nine, and was discovered on the music program, &quot;Mawaheb&quot;, broadcast on Moroccan TV. She then moved to Egypt where her fame around the Arab world began. She has dual nationality in Morocco and Egypt, her resident home, as she moved to Cairo in 1977. All her albums are in Egyptian Arabic, but she has also recorded some songs in Moroccan Arabic, such as &quot;Kifash Tlakina&quot; (&quot;How we Met&quot;), &quot;Fayetli sheftek shi marra&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve seen you once&quot;), &quot;Sarkouh&quot; (&quot;They Stole Him&quot;), and &quot;Al Behhara&quot; (&quot;Mariners&quot;). Her singles included &quot;Maghlouba&quot; (&quot;Beaten&quot;) and &quot;Wa&#x27;ady&quot; (&quot;My Love&quot;). In 1980 she represented her native Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest singing a hit song in Netherlands at that time called &quot;Bitaqat Hub&quot;, placing 18th out of the 19 contestants.

Said has recorded many Arabic hits that were ranked highly in Egypt, such as &quot;Ben Lef&quot; (&quot;The Circle of Life&quot;), &quot;Sayidati Sadati&quot; (Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;), &quot;Malich 3inwan&quot; (&quot;Ready When You Are&quot;) and &quot;Akher Hawa&quot; (&quot;Last Love&quot;). She worked with the Egyptian composer Mohamed El Mougi, and sang and acted in the film &quot;Saaktob Ismak Ala Arrimal&quot; (&quot;I Will Write Your Name in the Sand&quot;), which included her singing &quot;Yadamiiti Haddi&quot; (&quot;Tears, Fall from My Eyes&quot;). Other recordings include &quot;Lilet El Ouns&quot; (&quot;Magnificent Get-Together&quot;), &quot;Ech Gab Li Gab&quot; (&quot;A Cut about the Rest&quot;), &quot;Amrak Aagib&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Get You&quot;), and &quot;Menghir Sabab&quot; (&quot;For No Reason&quot;).
In 2000, she released the song &quot;Lilah Habeebee&quot;, (&quot;One Night, My Love&quot;), the album title track, which went on to win for best video in the Arab world in 2001 at the Cairo Arabic Music Festival. At the 15th annual World Music Awards in 2003, Said won a World Music Award based on worldwide sales figures for that year. She won the BBC award for world music for the best artist in the Middle East with her album &quot;Youm Wara Youm&quot;. She has won more than 40 awards.

==Reception==
Halina Hopkis called Said &quot;an emblem of trans-nationality in her moves between Morocco and Egypt as well the different awards and shows she has received and participated in as a representative of the Arabic music community&quot;.

In 2003, Said was chosen as the best singer in the Middle East by BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music. She won the Rabab D&#x27;or prize at the Tétouan&#x27;s Voix des Femmes Festival in 2008. She was the winner of the Murex d&#x27;Or Award in 2009.

At the 2009 Timitar Festival in Agadir, Said performed for a crowd of 100,000. In 2011, the Beirut International Award Festival (BIAF) honored a number of Arab and international singers, including Said.

She has been both credited and criticized for bringing Arab music into the pop-driven, commercially fueled 21st century.

According to Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al Ahram&quot;, Said&#x27;s albums have sold over 60 million copies. &quot;Aweeny Beek&quot; is the top selling Arabic album in the Middle East and worldwide to date, with over 10 million copies released in 2004.

==Musical style==
Halina Hopkins said that &quot;One reason Said’s music is popular is because of the tonal beauty of her voice against the background instrumentation. The centrality of her voice represents her personal influence in her work.

==Personal life==
Said was married to Egyptian musician Hany Mehanna from 1988 to 1994. She then married businessman Mustafa Naboulsy, with whom she had her only son, Shady.

In multiple interviews, Said has expressed her desire to return to Morocco and live near her family and loved ones.

== Philanthropy and humanitarian work ==
Said spearheaded concerts to draw people together after the 2006 riots in immigrant suburbs across France and solidarize between faiths.

<text>The RPG-29 &quot;Vampir&quot; is a Soviet reusable rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. Adopted by the Soviet Army in 1989, it was the last RPG to be adopted by the Soviet military before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The RPG-29 has since been supplemented by other rocket-propelled systems, such as the RPG-30 and RPG-32.

==Description==
The RPG-29 is a shoulder-fired, unguided, tube-style, breech-loading anti-tank rocket system with an effective range of . The light weapon is designed to be carried and used by one soldier. Atop the launch tube is a 2.7× 1P38 optical sight.

When launched, the missile deploys eight fins as the rocket leaves the launcher, stabilizing the rocket during flight, up to an effective range of .

Three warheads are available for the weapon:
* The TBG-29V thermobaric anti-personnel round.
* The OG-29 high-explosive/fragmentation (HE/FRAG) round for anti-personnel purposes. This is an Iranian round produced by Shahed Weaponry with a time fuze and over 2,000 premade fragments.
* The PG-29V anti-tank/bunker round has a tandem-charge high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead to defeat explosive reactive armor (ERA). This warhead is standardized with that of the PG-7VR round fired by the RPG-7V rocket launcher. With a tandem-charge, an initial small charge detonates any reactive armor. If explosive reactive armor (ERA) or cage armor is absent, this charge strikes the main armor. Behind the primary charge, a much larger secondary shaped charge bursts at the rear of the initial warhead and projects a thin, high-speed-jet of metal into the armour compromised by the first charge. PG-29V can kill hard targets, including tanks with ERA.

The RPG-29 is unusual among Russian anti-tank rocket launchers in that it lacks an initial propellant charge to place the projectile at a safe distance from the operator before the rocket ignites. Instead, the rocket engine starts as soon as a trigger is pulled, and burns out before the projectile leaves the barrel.

On the bottom of the tube is a shoulder brace for proper positioning along with a pistol grip trigger mechanism. A side rail on its left side accepts a 1PN51-2 night sight.

==History==

The RPG-29 was developed during the late 1980s, following the development of the RPG-26, and entered service with the Soviet Army in 1989. It has recently seen intermittent use by irregular forces in the Middle East theater, including in combat against Allied forces during the Iraq War, and the 2006 Lebanon War, when it was used against Israeli forces.

===2003 Iraq War===
The RPG-29 is believed to have been used in skirmishes against American and British forces during the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq. An RPG-29 round was reported in August 2006 to have penetrated the frontal underside hull (equipped with ERA) of a Challenger 2 tank during an engagement in al-Amarah, Iraq, maiming one and wounding several other crew members, but only lightly damaging the tank, which drove home under its own power.

On August 25, 2007 a PG-29V hit a passing M1 Abrams in the hull rear wounding 3 crew members. On September 5, 2007, a PG-29V hit the side turret of an M1 Abrams in Baghdad, killing 2 of the crew and wounding 1, and the tank was seriously damaged.

In May 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; disclosed that another M1 Abrams tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq, while fighting Shia militias at Sadr City. The US Army ranks the RPG-29 threat to armor so high that they refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into insurgent hands.

===2006 Lebanon War===
During the conflict, the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; stated that the RPG-29 was a major source of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) casualties in the 2006 Lebanon War. Shortly before the end of the conflict the Russian &quot; Kommersant&quot; magazine acknowledged through anonymous sources the possibility of a weapons transfer between Syria and Hezbollah during the Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.

=== Syrian Civil War ===
During the Syrian Civil War, Syrian Opposition Forces, Syrian Armed Forces and Islamic State (ISIL) used RPG-29s.

===Mexican Drug War===
The cartels are known to have smuggled RPG-29s with some seized by Mexican forces.

===2014 Gaza War===
During the 2014 Gaza War, Hamas had RPG-29s in their inventory.

===Iraqi Civil War===
During the Iraqi Civil War, ISIL has used RPG-29s in Iraq, probably ones taken in Syria. And anti-ISIL Shia militias in Iraq have also used RPG-29s, the Iranian produced &quot;Ghadir&quot;, which was supplied by Iran.

==Operators==
===State operators===
* - Locally produced
* Iran - Locally produced as the &quot;Ghadir&quot;
* Mexico -Locally produced 
* North Korea
* Russia
* Syria
* Pakistan
* Vietnam - Locally produced 

===Non-state organizations===
*
* Iraqi insurgents (2003–11)
* - At least one used during the Siege of Menagh Air Base in the Syrian Civil War
* (during 2013 through 2015)
* Syrian rebels

===Former operators===
* - Passed on to successor states.

<text>Ancient Egyptian mathematics is the mathematics that was developed and used in Ancient Egypt 3000 to c. , from the Old Kingdom of Egypt until roughly the beginning of Hellenistic Egypt. The ancient Egyptians utilized a numeral system for counting and solving written mathematical problems, often involving multiplication and fractions. Evidence for Egyptian mathematics is limited to a scarce amount of surviving sources written on papyrus. From these texts it is known that ancient Egyptians understood concepts of geometry, such as determining the surface area and volume of three-dimensional shapes useful for architectural engineering, and algebra, such as the false position method and quadratic equations.
== Overview ==

Written evidence of the use of mathematics dates back to at least 3200 BC with the ivory labels found in Tomb U-j at Abydos. These labels appear to have been used as tags for grave goods and some are inscribed with numbers. Further evidence of the use of the base 10 number system can be found on the Narmer Macehead which depicts offerings of 400,000 oxen, 1,422,000 goats and 120,000 prisoners. Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Ancient Egyptian counting system had origins in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, fractal geometry designs which are widespread among Sub-Saharan African cultures are also found in Egyptian architecture and cosmological signs.

The evidence of the use of mathematics in the Old Kingdom (c. 2690–2180 BC) is scarce, but can be deduced from inscriptions on a wall near a mastaba in Meidum which gives guidelines for the slope of the mastaba. The lines in the diagram are spaced at a distance of one cubit and show the use of that unit of measurement.

The earliest true mathematical documents date to the 12th Dynasty (c. 1990–1800 BC). The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll, the Lahun Mathematical Papyri which are a part of the much larger collection of Kahun Papyri and the Berlin Papyrus 6619 all date to this period. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus which dates to the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650 BC) is said to be based on an older mathematical text from the 12th dynasty.

The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Rhind Mathematical Papyrus are so called mathematical problem texts. They consist of a collection of problems with solutions. These texts may have been written by a teacher or a student engaged in solving typical mathematics problems.

An interesting feature of ancient Egyptian mathematics is the use of unit fractions. The Egyptians used some special notation for fractions such as , and and in some texts for , but other fractions were all written as unit fractions of the form or sums of such unit fractions. Scribes used tables to help them work with these fractions. The Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll for instance is a table of unit fractions which are expressed as sums of other unit fractions. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and some of the other texts contain tables. These tables allowed the scribes to rewrite any fraction of the form as a sum of unit fractions.

During the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) mathematical problems are mentioned in the literary Papyrus Anastasi I, and the Papyrus Wilbour from the time of Ramesses III records land measurements. In the workers village of Deir el-Medina several ostraca have been found that record volumes of dirt removed while quarrying the tombs.

==Sources==
Current understanding of ancient Egyptian mathematics is impeded by the paucity of available sources. The sources that do exist include the following texts (which are generally dated to the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period):
* The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus
* The Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll
* The Lahun Mathematical Papyri
* The Berlin Papyrus 6619, written around 1800 BC
* The Akhmim Wooden Tablet
* The Reisner Papyrus, dated to the early Twelfth dynasty of Egypt and found in Nag el-Deir, the ancient town of Thinis
* The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP), dated from the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650 BC), but its author, Ahmes, identifies it as a copy of a now lost Middle Kingdom papyrus. The RMP is the largest mathematical text.

From the New Kingdom there are a handful of mathematical texts and inscriptions related to computations:
* The Papyrus Anastasi I, a literary text written as a (fictional) letter written by a scribe named Hori and addressed to a scribe named Amenemope. A segment of the letter describes several mathematical problems.
* Ostracon Senmut 153, a text written in hieratic
* Ostracon Turin 57170, a text written in hieratic
* Ostraca from Deir el-Medina contain computations. Ostracon IFAO 1206 for instance shows the calculation of volumes, presumably related to the quarrying of a tomb.

According to Étienne Gilson, Abraham &quot;taught the Egyptians arythmetic and astronomy&quot;.

== Numerals ==
Ancient Egyptian texts could be written in either hieroglyphs or in hieratic. In either representation the number system was always given in base 10. The number 1 was depicted by a simple stroke, the number 2 was represented by two strokes, etc. The numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 had their own hieroglyphs. Number 10 is a hobble for cattle, number 100 is represented by a coiled rope, the number 1000 is represented by a lotus flower, the number 10,000 is represented by a finger, the number 100,000 is represented by a frog, and a million was represented by a god with his hands raised in adoration.

Egyptian numerals date back to the Predynastic period. Ivory labels from Abydos record the use of this number system. It is also common to see the numerals in offering scenes to indicate the number of items offered. The king&#x27;s daughter Neferetiabet is shown with an offering of 1000 oxen, bread, beer, etc.

The Egyptian number system was additive. Large numbers were represented by collections of the glyphs and the value was obtained by simply adding the individual numbers together.

The Egyptians almost exclusively used fractions of the form . One notable exception is the fraction , which is frequently found in the mathematical texts. Very rarely a special glyph was used to denote . The fraction was represented by a glyph that may have depicted a piece of linen folded in two. The fraction was represented by the glyph for a mouth with 2 (different sized) strokes. The rest of the fractions were always represented by a mouth super-imposed over a number.

==Notation==
Steps of calculations were written in sentences in Egyptian languages. (e.g. &quot;Multiply 10 times 100; it becomes 1000.&quot;)

In Rhind Papyrus Problem 28, the hieroglyphs D54-and-D55 (D54, D55), symbols for feet, were used to mean &quot;to add&quot; and &quot;to subtract.&quot; These were presumably shorthands for G35-D54 and O1:D21:D54 meaning &quot;to go in&quot; and &quot;to go out.&quot;

==Multiplication and division==

Egyptian multiplication was done by a repeated doubling of the number to be multiplied (the multiplicand), and choosing which of the doublings to add together (essentially a form of binary arithmetic), a method that links to the Old Kingdom. The multiplicand was written next to figure 1; the multiplicand was then added to itself, and the result written next to the number 2. The process was continued until the doublings gave a number greater than half of the multiplier. Then the doubled numbers (1, 2, etc.) would be repeatedly subtracted from the multiplier to select which of the results of the existing calculations should be added together to create the answer.

As a shortcut for larger numbers, the multiplicand can also be immediately multiplied by 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc.

For example, Problem 69 on the Rhind Papyrus (RMP) provides the following illustration, as if Hieroglyphic symbols were used (rather than the RMP&#x27;s actual hieratic script).
The &quot;&quot; denotes the intermediate results that are added together to produce the final answer.

The table above can also be used to divide 1120 by 80. We would solve this problem by finding the quotient (80) as the sum of those multipliers of 80 that add up to 1120. In this example that would yield a quotient of 10 + 4 = 14. A more complicated example of the division algorithm is provided by Problem 66. A total of 3200 ro of fat are to be distributed evenly over 365 days.

First the scribe would double 365 repeatedly until the largest possible multiple of 365 is reached, which is smaller than 3200. In this case 8 times 365 is 2920 and further addition of multiples of 365 would clearly give a value greater than 3200. Next it is noted that  +  +  times 365 gives us the value of 280 we need. Hence we find that 3200 divided by 365 must equal 8 +  +  + .

==Algebra==
Egyptian algebra problems appear in both the Rhind mathematical papyrus and the Moscow mathematical papyrus as well as several other sources.

Aha problems involve finding unknown quantities (referred to as Aha) if the sum of the quantity and part(s) of it are given. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus also contains four of these type of problems. Problems 1, 19, and 25 of the Moscow Papyrus are Aha problems. For instance problem 19 asks one to calculate a quantity taken times and added to 4 to make 10. In other words, in modern mathematical notation we are asked to solve the linear equation:

:formula_1

Solving these Aha problems involves a technique called method of false position. The technique is also called the method of false assumption. The scribe would substitute an initial guess of the answer into the problem. The solution using the false assumption would be proportional to the actual answer, and the scribe would find the answer by using this ratio.

The mathematical writings show that the scribes used (least) common multiples to turn problems with fractions into problems using integers. In this connection red auxiliary numbers are written next to the fractions.

The use of the Horus eye fractions shows some (rudimentary) knowledge of geometrical progression. Knowledge of arithmetic progressions is also evident from the mathematical sources.

===Quadratic equations===
The ancient Egyptians were the first civilization to develop and solve second-degree (quadratic) equations. This information is found in the Berlin Papyrus fragment. Additionally, the Egyptians solve first-degree algebraic equations found in Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.

==Geometry==

There are only a limited number of problems from ancient Egypt that concern geometry. Geometric problems appear in both the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (MMP) and in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP). The examples demonstrate that the Ancient Egyptians knew how to compute areas of several geometric shapes and the volumes of cylinders and pyramids.

* Area:
** Triangles: The scribes record problems computing the area of a triangle (RMP and MMP).
** Rectangles: Problems regarding the area of a rectangular plot of land appear in the RMP and the MMP. A similar problem appears in the Lahun Mathematical Papyri in London.
** Circles: Problem 48 of the RMP compares the area of a circle (approximated by an octagon) and its circumscribing square. This problem&#x27;s result is used in problem 50, where the scribe finds the area of a round field of diameter 9 khet.
** Hemisphere: Problem 10 in the MMP finds the area of a hemisphere.
* Volumes:
** Cylindrical (cylinder): Several problems compute the volume of cylindrical granaries (RMP 41–43), while problem 60 RMP seems to concern a pillar or a cone instead of a pyramid. It is rather small and steep, with a seked (reciprocal of slope) of four palms (per cubit). In section IV.3 of the Lahun Mathematical Papyri the volume of a granary with a circular base is found using the same procedure as RMP 43.
** Rectangular (Cuboid): Several problems in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (problem 14) and in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (numbers 44, 45, 46) compute the volume of a rectangular granary.
** Truncated pyramid (frustum) Frustum: The volume of a truncated pyramid is computed in MMP 14.

===The Seqed===
Problem 56 of the RMP indicates an understanding of the idea of geometric similarity. This problem discusses the ratio run/rise, also known as the seqed. Such a formula would be needed for building pyramids. In the next problem (Problem 57), the height of a pyramid is calculated from the base length and the &quot;seked&quot; (Egyptian for the reciprocal of the slope), while problem 58 gives the length of the base and the height and uses these measurements to compute the seqed. In Problem 59 part 1 computes the seqed, while the second part may be a computation to check the answer: &quot;If you construct a pyramid with base side 12 [cubits] and with a seqed of 5 palms 1 finger; what is its altitude?&quot;

<doc id="1180117" wikidata="Q3305321" url="?curid=1180117" title="Arbuckle Mountains">
<text>The Arbuckle Mountains are an ancient mountain range in south-central Oklahoma in the United States. They lie in Murray, Carter, Pontotoc, and Johnston counties. The granite rocks of the Arbuckles date back to the Precambrian Eon some 1.4 billion years ago which were overlain by rhyolites during the Cambrian Period. The range reaches a height of 1,412 feet above sea level. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS):

==History==

The Arbuckle Mountains are the oldest known formations in the United States between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains. They contain a core of granite and gneiss that date back at least 1.4 billion years. The core is overlain by a layer of Cambrian period rhyolite that is about 525 million years old. Atop the rhyolite is about of folded and faulted limestones, dolomites, sandstones, and shales deposited in shallow seas from Late Cambrian through Pennsylvanian time (515 - 290 million years ago).

They were named indirectly for Gen. Matthew Arbuckle (1778–1851), a career soldier from Virginia who was active in the Indian Territory for the last thirty years of his life. Shortly before his death at Fort Smith, Arkansas, from cholera, several detachments of troops under his command had established an outpost to protect the California road, on Wildhorse Creek in present-day Garvin County, Oklahoma. The post was then named Fort Arbuckle in his honor. Though the post was abandoned in 1870, the name had already transferred in common usage to the nearby hills.

==Geology==

Geologically the Arbuckles are an elongate anticline structure with an orientation or strike of west-northwest. The core of the structure consists of Proterozoic extrusive and intrusive rocks, the Colbert rhyolite porphyry and the Tishomingo granite (age dated at 1374 Ma), which are overlain by the Arbuckle Group, the Simpson Group, Viola Group, and the Hunton Group. Uplift, faulting, and folding occurred during the Wichita Orogeny, followed by erosion. 

===Hydrology and karst features===
Underlying the Arbuckle Mountains is the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer, housing freshwater which emanates at springs to provide the base flows of the Blue River and Honey Creek, which flows over Turner Falls south of Davis.

As a result of the karst topography, standing water is rarely found atop the Arbuckle Mountains, the water seeps through fractures and planes of separation in the limestone bedrock, dissolving the rock to produce a network of caves and solution conduits throughout the limestone formations. Organizations such as the Arbuckle Karst Conservancy and Arbuckle Mountains Grotto of the National Speleological Society actively study the karst features of the Arbuckle Mountains to preserve the biological ecosystems and groundwater resources. The organizations currently maintain databases of more than 1,000 caves and springs in the Arbuckle Mountains. The Arbuckles have gradually eroded to their present heights of 300–500 feet above the surrounding terrain or 1300–1400 feet above sea level.

==Recreation and access==
 The range is approximately east-to-west and 10–15 miles north-to-south. The main part of the range is located in northern Carter County and southern Murray County, approximately north of Ardmore and south of Davis, Oklahoma on Interstate 35. The eastern flank of the ridge is approximately south of Sulphur on U.S. Highway 177.

Popular recreation areas in the Arbuckle Mountains include Turner Falls Park, the Chickasaw National Recreation Area, and Lake of the Arbuckles. Turner Falls is located south of Davis, whereas Chickasaw NRA is located in the city of Sulphur.

The area is also the location of several campgrounds, including the YMCA&#x27;s Camp Classen and the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma&#x27;s Falls Creek Baptist Conference Center, which hosts 55,000 campers each summer.

<text>McEnroe is an American television talk show hosted by tennis player John McEnroe that was broadcast on CNBC from July 7 to December 15, 2004. It was taped at CNBC&#x27;s New Jersey studio, and tapings began at about 2 p.m. The show aired Monday through Thursday on the network. McEnroe&#x27;s wife, Patty Smyth, sang the show&#x27;s theme song. His sidekick was John Fugelsang. 

The show&#x27;s first week averaged 174,000 viewers, a decline from the 200,000 viewers drawn by the predecessor in its time slot, &quot;The News with Brian Williams&quot;. The show was panned by critics right from its debut, and its ratings dropped precipitously through the following weeks; by mid-August, at least four episodes had registered a Nielsen rating of 0.0, and viewership hit a low of 35,000 people on August 10. When the show took a subsequent two-week break for CNBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2004 Summer Olympics, Woody Fraser was brought in to be the executive producer to try to save the show. He suggested changing the appearance of the show, such as having McEnroe dress more professionally by wearing suits and ties and diminishing Fugelsang&#x27;s involvement, but could not save the show&#x27;s fortunes.

On December 3, 2004, CNBC executives sent a memo to network employees saying the show was being canceled. McEnroe was given the option of stopping production immediately or allowing the show to go two more weeks. McEnroe decided to let the show last two more weeks to give the show&#x27;s crew more work before the show went off-air. The last episode aired on December 15, 2004. Its 10 pm slot was taken by another talk show, &quot;The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch&quot;.

<text>I Was a Teenage Werewolf is a 1957 American science fiction horror film directed by Gene Fowler Jr., and starring Michael Landon as a troubled teenager, Yvonne Lime and Whit Bissell. Co-written and produced by cult film producer Herman Cohen, it was one of the most successful films released by American International Pictures (AIP).

The film was originally released as a double feature with &quot;Invasion of the Saucer Men&quot;. The release included the tagline, &quot;We DARE You To See The Most Amazing Motion Pictures Of Our Time!&quot;

== Plot ==
Tony Rivers, a troubled teenager at Rockdale High, has a short temper that gets him into numerous fights. Local police Detective Donovan advises Tony to talk with a psychologist who works at the local aircraft plant, Dr. Alfred Brandon, a practitioner of hypnotherapy. Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene, as well as his widowed father Charles, show concern about his violent behavior. At a Halloween party at the &quot;haunted house&quot;, an old house at which teenagers hang out, Tony attacks his friend Vic after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends&#x27; faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon.

Brandon concludes that Tony&#x27;s troubled history makes him an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he has developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Although Brandon&#x27;s assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner, protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon injects Tony with the serum, telling him it is a sedative to prepare him for hypnosis. During a series of hypnosis sessions, Brandon draws out Tony&#x27;s traumatic childhood memories and suggests to Tony that he was once a wild animal.

After a party at the haunted house, one of Tony&#x27;s buddies, Frank, is attacked and killed as he walks home through the woods. Donovan and Police Chief Baker review photographs of the victim and notice that the fatal wounds look like fang marks, but there are no wild animals in the area. Pepi, the police station&#x27;s janitor and a native of the Carpathian Mountains, where werewolves are common, recognizes the marks in the photos.

After another session with Brandon, during which Tony tells the doctor that he feels that something is very wrong with him, Tony reports to Miss Ferguson, the principal of Rockdale High. She tells Tony that Brandon has given him a positive report and she intends to recommend him for entry into State College. As Tony leaves the school, he passes the gymnasium where a woman, Theresa, is by herself. A school bell behind his head rings, triggering his transformation into a werewolf, and he attacks and kills Theresa. Tony flees the high school, and witnesses identify him by his clothing. Baker issues an all-points bulletin for his arrest.

In the morning, Tony reverts to his normal appearance, heads to Brandon&#x27;s office, and begs for help. Brandon wants to capture Tony&#x27;s transformation on film in order to prove that his procedure works and injects him with the serum again. Following the transformation, a ringing telephone triggers Tony&#x27;s instincts, and he kills Brandon and Wagner, breaking open the camera in the process and ruining the film. Alerted that Tony has been seen nearby, Donovan and another officer break in and shoot several times as Tony advances toward them. When Tony dies, his normal features return, leaving Donovan to speculate on Brandon&#x27;s involvement and on the mistake of people interfering in the realms of God.

==Production==
Samuel Z. Arkoff wrote in his memoirs that he got a lot of resistance for producing a film portraying a teenager becoming a monster, an idea that had never been exploited in film before.

Dawn Richard, who plays a teenaged gymnast in the film, was a 21-year-old &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfold model at the time, appearing in the magazine&#x27;s May 1957 issue, which hit the newsstands a month ahead of the movie.

Pepe, the Romanian janitor at the police station, was played by the Russian-born Vladimir Sokoloff, a character actor who appeared as ethnic types in over 100 productions, his most famous being the old Mexican man in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; three years later.

Tony Marshall is the only other male actor to receive billing in the trailer for &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, in addition to Landon and Bissell; however, he made only one other motion picture, the obscure &quot;Rockabilly Baby&quot;, for Twentieth Century-Fox, which was released in October of the same year.

Shooting began 13 February 1957. The movie was shot in seven days.

This film was the first of four &quot;teenage monster&quot; movies produced by AIP during 1957 and 1958. All four films highlighting a theme of innocent teenagers being preyed upon, transformed, and used by corrupt adults for selfish interests. &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot; were both released in November 1957 and feature a teenage boy transformed into a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and a teenage girl transformed into a werewolf-like vampire, respectively. &quot;How to Make a Monster&quot;, released in 1958, features two young actors being hypnotized to kill while in make-up as the monster characters &quot;Teenage Werewolf&quot; and &quot;Teenage Frankenstein&quot; of the 1957 films.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Variety&quot; reported: &quot;Another in the cycle of regression themes is a combo teenager and science-fiction yarn which should do okay in the exploitation market [...] Only thing new about this Herman Cohen production is a psychiatrist&#x27;s use of a problem teenager [...] but it&#x27;s handled well enough to meet the requirements of this type film. [...] good performances help overcome deficiencies. Final reels, where the lad turns into a hairy-headed monster with drooling fangs, are inclined to be played too heavily.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; went on to say that Landon delivers &quot;a first-class characterization as the high school boy constantly in trouble.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; was fairly positive, writing, &quot;This horror type program melodrama should give pretty good satisfaction in theatres where such films are acceptable. The story is, of course, fantastic, but it has been handled so expertly that it holds the spectator in tense suspense.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; in the UK was negative, declaring, &quot;A piece of old-fashioned and second-rate horror, the transformations are very badly done, the scientific background is shaky in the extreme and the monster looks like anything but the usual idea of a werewolf. It all seems rather hard on poor Tony, who is quite a pleasant boy when he&#x27;s himself.&quot;

According to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of &quot;cheap teen movies&quot; released for the drive-in market. They consisted of &quot;exploitative, cheap fare created especially for them [teens] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre.&quot;

The film was very profitable, as it was made on a budget of $82,000 and grossed as much as US $2,000,000.
Released in June 1957, it was followed five months later by &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot; and by the sequel &quot;How to Make a Monster&quot; in July 1958.

===AIP&#x27;s female &quot;teenage vampire&quot; companion piece===

Less than four months after the release of &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; and coinciding with the release of &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot;, AIP released &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot;, a film which bears more than a passing resemblance to their summer box office hit. More or less a remake, and with the hero and villain roles now both played by females, &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot;, with a story and screenplay credit by &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; writer Ralph Thornton (a pseudonym for AIP producer Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel), features many other similarities to &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;: for instance, both have (among other things) a teenager with social behavior problems, an adult mad scientist who is searching for the perfect guinea pig under the guise of helping troubled youth, an observer who can tell the killings are the work of a monster, a disbelieving police chief afraid of the press, a song written by Jerry Blaine and Paul Dunlap accompanied by a choreographed &quot;ad-lib&quot; dance number, hypnosis as a scientific medical treatment, drug injections, specific references to Carpathia, hairy transformation scenes and even some of the same dialogue. In addition, two prominent actors from &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; are also featured in &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot;, Malcolm Atterbury and Louise Lewis, with Lewis&#x27; villain, &#x27;Miss Branding&#x27; a practically perfect female version of Whit Bissel&#x27;s &#x27;Dr. Brandon&#x27;. However, few critics have drawn a connection between the two films and while most reference works consider &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;How to Make a Monster&quot; as direct follow-ups to &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, not even critic Leonard Maltin speaks of &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot; as being related to the trilogy.

==Legacy==
After &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf,&quot; its star Landon became a regular on &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–73). Another actor from the film, Guy Williams, played Zorro in the Disney TV series &quot;Zorro&quot; (1957–59), and Professor John Robinson on the TV show &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965–68). In &quot;Bonanza&quot; Williams and Landon appeared together in some episodes. Another star from the film, Whit Bissell, played Gen. Kirk on the short-run TV series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;.

Although today the film is largely regarded as a source of &quot;camp&quot; humor, and while at the time of release the idea of an adult human turning into a beast was not new, a &quot;teenager&quot; doing so in a movie was considered avant-garde—and even shocking—in 1957. &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; likely paved the way for Walt Disney to do his version of a Felix Salten shapeshifting novel, &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot;. Featuring Disney favorite Tommy Kirk as the hapless teenager, and A-lister Fred MacMurray as the answer to B-lister Whit Bissell, it was released in 1959 under the title &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;. The film betrays its successful forebear with Murray&#x27;s classic bit of dialogue: &quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous — my son isn&#x27;t any werewolf! He&#x27;s just a big, baggy, stupid-looking, shaggy dog!&quot;

=== Pop culture impact ===
The film&#x27;s &quot;Police Gazette&quot;-style title (which had already been used by Hollywood previously with pictures such as 1949&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot; and 1951&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Communist for the FBI&quot;) with the inclusion of the adjective &quot;teenage&quot; was used again by AIP for their sequel &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot;, and the original working title for their 1958 sci-fi film &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; was &quot;I Was a Teenage Doll.&quot; Due to the success of &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, this convention was satirised by others, for instance, the 1959 Dobie Gillis novel &quot;I Was a Teenage Dwarf&quot; by Max Shulman.

====Film====
Over the years, the &quot;I Was a Teenage...&quot; title was played on by several unrelated films, usually comedies, wishing to make a connection with the cult AIP hit, including &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot;, the 1963 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;I Was a Teenage Thumb&quot;, 1987&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Teenage Zombie&quot;, 1992&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Teenage Mummy&quot;, 1993&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Teenage Serial Killer&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;I Was a Teenage Intellectual.&quot;

The script title for 1985&#x27;s &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot; was &quot;I Was a Teenage Boy&quot;, a title that used a year later as an alternate for 1986&#x27;s &quot;Willy/Milly&quot;. A working title for the 1995 hit &quot;Clueless&quot; was &quot;I Was a Teenage Teenager&quot;.

Scenes from &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; were included in the 1973 &quot;fifties nostalgia&quot; concert film &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;, featuring Madison Square Garden performances from Chuck Berry and Bill Haley and the Comets.

====Television====
Episode 2.19 (1963) of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; was entitled &quot;I Was a Teenage Head Writer&quot;.

Episode 1.18 (1967) of &quot;The Monkees&quot; was entitled &quot;I Was a Teenage Monster&quot;.

The July 16, 1982 episode of &quot;SCTV&quot; (&quot;Battle of the PBS Stars&quot;) featured a comedy skit of the movie called &quot;I Was a Teenage Communist&quot;, mixing horror with the politics of red-baiting during the 1950s.

In 1987, the NBC-TV series &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; featured &quot;I Was a Middle-Aged Werewolf&quot; (episode 4.5), written and directed by Michael Landon. Landon, as angel Jonathan Smith, transforms himself into a werewolf, initially to scare off some teenage bullies. During the earlier scenes, Jonathan&#x27;s buddy, Mark Gordon (Victor French) watches the original film, remarking: &quot;You know, the guy in this movie reminds me a lot of you&quot;, adding, &quot;when he&#x27;s a regular guy, not when he&#x27;s got fuzz all over his face.&quot;

In April 1997, the movie was mocked directly when it was featured in episode 809 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. The host segments, however, parody the film &quot;Alien.&quot;

The October 28, 1999 episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; is titled &quot;I Was a Teenage Gary&quot; and features SpongeBob transforming into a snail after a hypodermic injection.

A &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode in 2010 was titled &quot;I Was a Middle-Aged Robot&quot;. It involves Phineas&#x27; dad, Mr. Fletcher, having his imagination sucked away and the O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym) replacing him with a robot controlled by Phineas &amp; Ferb&#x27;s pet platypus, Perry, also known as Agent P.

An episode of The Owl House in 2020 is titled &quot;I Was a Teenage Abomination&quot;. It follows Luz as she sneaks into the local magic school and pretends to be a magical abomination to help her new friend, Willow, pass abomination class.

====Music====
Starting in 1975 and known as the first Horror Punk band, Sid Terror&#x27;s Undead has given nods to this movie a couple times, on their self-titled first album SID TERROR&#x27;S UNDEAD (1978) with the song I Was A Teenage Vampire (words and music written by Sid Terror), and again with the song &quot;Awkward&quot; (words and music written by Sid Terror reference the I Was A Teenage Werewolf sequel, I Was A Teenage Frankenstein (1957)) as recently as 2020 on their album Pandemic Garage. John Cooper Clarke&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;Disguise in Love &quot; features the song &quot;Teenage Werewolf&quot;, the song goes on to feature in Clarke&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Anthological&quot;. The Cramps, whose songs routinely reference horror and sci-fi films, have a song titled &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; on their 1980 album &quot;Songs the Lord Taught Us&quot;. Anarchist vegan punk band Propagandhi wrote a song titled &quot;I Was a Pre-Teen McCarthyist&quot; and is featured on the 1996 album &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot;. Rock band Queens of the Stone Age have a song on their 1998 self-titled debut album with the title, &quot;I Was a Teenage Hand Model&quot;. Australian rock band Faker released a song in 2005 entitled &quot;Teenage Werewolf.&quot; Punk band Against Me! released a song in 2010 titled &quot;I Was a Teenage Anarchist&quot;. Pop punk artist Lil Cam&#x27;Ron&#x27;s debut album &quot;I Was a Teenage Cameron&quot; also references the title. American Musical Theater Composer Joe Iconis wrote a song titled . Brazilian rock band Legião Urbana has a song called &quot;Eu Era Um Lobisomem Juvenil&quot;, title of the movie in Portuguese. Australian band Magic Dirt&#x27;s 2000 song &quot;Teenage Vampire&quot; is a reference to the film&#x27;s title.

====Publishing====
In Stephen King&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;It&quot; (and its made-for-TV film adaptation), several of the characters watch this movie. Afterward, Pennywise takes the form of a real teenage werewolf to frighten them, particularly Richie. When the Losers Club first attacks Pennywise, it takes the form of the teenage werewolf. In 2002, Last Gasp published &quot;I Was a Teenage Dominatrix&quot;, a memoir by Shawna Kenney. In 2015, the anthology &quot;Killer Bees from Outer Space&quot; (KnightWatch Press) featured a story, &quot;I Was a Teenage Mummy Girl,&quot; by Amelia Mangan.

<text>Hypersthene is a common rock-forming inosilicate mineral belonging to the group of orthorhombic pyroxenes. Its chemical formula is . It is found in igneous and some metamorphic rocks as well as in stony and iron meteorites. Many references have formally abandoned this term, preferring to categorise this mineral as enstatite or ferrosilite. It forms a solid solution series with the minerals enstatite and ferrosilite, being a mid-way member between the two. Pure enstatite contains no iron, while pure ferrosilite contains no magnesium; hypersthene is the name given to the mineral when a significant amount of both elements are present. Enstatite is stable at atmospheric pressure, but ferrosilite is stable only at elevated pressure, decomposing into quartz and fayalite at atmospheric pressure unless stabilized by magnesium or other impurities.

Distinctly developed crystals are rare, the mineral being usually found as foliated masses embedded in the igneous rocks norite and hypersthene-andesite, of which it forms an essential constituent. The coarse-grained labradorite-hypersthene-rock (norite) of Paul&#x27;s Island off the coast of Labrador has furnished the most typical material; for this reason, the mineral has been known as Labrador hornblende or paulite.

Color is often gray, brown, or green, and the luster is usually vitreous to pearly. The pleochroism is strong, the hardness is 5–6, and the specific gravity is 3.4–3.9. On certain surfaces it displays a brilliant copper-red metallic sheen, or schiller, which has the same origin as the bronzy sheen of bronzite, but is even more pronounced. Like bronzite, it is sometimes cut and polished as a gemstone.

The name &quot;hypersthene&quot; comes from the Greek and means &quot;over strength&quot;, and is an allusion to its being harder than the amphibole mineral hornblende (a mineral with which it is often confused.

Hypersthene has been discredited by the International Mineralogical Association.

<text>The Alderney Railway on Alderney is the only railway in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and the only working railway in the Channel Islands. (There is a standard gauge railway at the Pallot Heritage Steam Museum in Jersey, but this provides no actual transport link, only pleasure rides.) The Alderney Railway opened in 1847 and runs for about , mostly following a coastal route, from Braye Road to Mannez Quarry and Lighthouse.

The railway is run by volunteers and usually operates during summer weekends and bank holidays.

== History ==
The railway was built by the British Government in the 1840s and opened in 1847. Its original purpose was to carry stone from the eastern end of the island to build the breakwater and the Victorian era forts.

Queen Victoria used the railway on three Royal visits to Alderney. On the first visit with Prince Albert on 8 August 1854, the Royal couple rode on a horse-drawn railway tender.

There are two stations on the line: and .

==Rolling stock==

===British Admiralty (1854–1923)===
(The railway was, presumably, owned by some other department of the British Government from 1847 to 1854)

===Channel Islands Granite Co Ltd (1923–1940)===
This company took over the railway in 1923, together with locomotives &quot;No.1&quot; and &quot;No.2&quot;. &quot;No.1&quot; was returned to England and replaced by Manning Wardle 0-6-0ST &quot;Nitro&quot;.

===German occupation (1940–1945)===
&quot;No.2&quot; and &quot;Nitro&quot; were commandeered by the Germans and are believed to have been shipped to Cherbourg in 1943 or 1944. The Germans lifted part of the standard gauge line and replaced it with a 600 mm gauge line, worked by two Feldbahn 0-4-0 diesel locomotives.

=== British Home Office (1945–50s)===

The line was restored to standard gauge in 1947–1949 and the following stock was used:

* Sentinel 4wVBT &quot;Molly&quot;, in service from 1947, withdrawn 1958. May have been converted to a mobile sand-blaster, which was still extant in 1980.
* Cowans Sheldon steam crane
* Ruston &amp; Hornsby 0-4-0 diesel &quot;Molly II&quot;
* Wickhams Type 27A trolleys

===Alderney Railway Co Ltd (1980–present)===

* Bagnall 0-4-0ST &quot;J.T. Daly&quot;, steam engine built in 1931, in service 1982 until 1996 when sold to the Pallot Heritage Steam Museum, Jersey
* London Underground 1938 Stock from Bakerloo and Northern lines, badly rusted and returned to UK in 2000 as spares.
* Former London Underground 1959 Stock cars nos. 1044 and 1045,
* A Vulcan Drewry 0-4-0 diesel locomotive no. D100 &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, bought in 1985.
* A Ruston &amp; Hornsby 0-4-0 diesel &quot;Molly II&quot; 
* Six Wickham rail cars. 

&quot;Molly II&quot; is currently awaiting modification to her coupler system, so she can haul the London Underground stock. However, this cannot happen at the moment because she is not yet owned by the Alderney Railway company.

Sheds to house the engines and railway stock were built at Mannez quarry in 1997 and 2008

<text>USS &quot;Canonicus&quot; was a single-turret monitor built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War, the lead ship of her class. The ship spent most of her first year in service stationed up the James River, where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron. She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher, defending the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina, from December 1864 to January 1865.

&quot;Canonicus&quot; was transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Charleston, South Carolina, after the capture of Fort Fisher in January, and helped to capture one blockade runner. She was sent to Havana, Cuba, to search for the Confederate ironclad and became one of the first ironclads to visit a foreign port. The ship was intermittently in commission from 1872 until she was permanently decommissioned in 1877. &quot;Canonicus&quot; was exhibited at the Jamestown Exposition of 1907, before she was sold for scrap the following year.

==Design==
The &quot;Canonicus&quot; class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding . They were long overall, had a beam of and had a maximum draft of . &quot;Canonicus&quot; had a tonnage of 1,034 tons burthen and displaced . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men.

&quot;Canonicus&quot; was powered by a two-cylinder horizontal Ericsson vibrating-lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire-tube boilers. The engine gave the ship a top speed of . She carried of coal. &quot;Canonicus&quot;″s main armament consisted of two smoothbore, muzzle-loading, Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret. Each gun weighed approximately . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +7°.

The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of wrought iron plates, backed by wood. The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one-inch plates. The ship&#x27;s deck was protected by armor thick. A soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. The base of the funnel was protected to a height of by of armor. A &quot;rifle screen&quot; of armor high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven, captain of her sister ship .

==Construction==
The contract for &quot;Canonicus&quot;, the first Navy ship to be named for the chief of the Narragansett Indians, was awarded to Harrison Loring; the ship was laid down in 1862, at their Boston, Massachusetts, shipyard. She was launched on 1 August 1863, and commissioned on 16 April 1864, with Commander E. G. Parrott, in command. The ship&#x27;s construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors. This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from to 10 inches, and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets, to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret. Other changes included deepening the hull by to increase the ship&#x27;s buoyancy, moving the position of the turret to balance the ship&#x27;s trim, and replacing all of the ship&#x27;s deck armor. As far as is known the ship was not modified after her completion.

== Service history==
&quot;Canonicus&quot; sailed from Boston, on 22 April 1864, and arrived at Newport News, Virginia, on 3 May, for service with the James River Flotilla. She reached the mouth of the Appomattox River, by 5 May. By 22 May, the ship was deployed with her sisters and &quot;Tecumseh&quot; on the James River, where they protected the transports of Major General Benjamin Butler&#x27;s Army of the James, supplying the army as it operated on the south bank of the river during the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. On 21 June, Commander Craven, of &quot;Tecumseh&quot;, spotted a line of breastworks that the Confederates were building at Howlett&#x27;s Farm, and his ship opened fire at the workers. The Confederates replied with a battery of four guns near the breastworks and &quot;Saugus&quot; and &quot;Canonicus&quot; joined in the bombardment. A half-hour later, Confederate ships near Dutch Gap joined in, but their fire was ineffective because they were firing blindly at the Union monitors. During the engagement &quot;Canonicus&quot; fired forty 15-inch shells and was hit twice by Confederate shells. One shell pierced the upper part of the funnel and the other struck the deck and ricocheted into the turret; no one was wounded or killed during the engagement. The ship dueled with Howlett&#x27;s Battery on 5 and 6 December, firing 46 shells without being hit in return. The only damage sustained was from the muzzle blast of the right gun that forced the armor at the gun port out about and broke a number of bolts.

Reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the monitor arrived at Beaufort, North Carolina, accompanied by the sidewheel gunboat , on 15 December 1864, and took part in the attacks on Fort Fisher, North Carolina. In the first engagement on 24–25 December, &quot;Canonicus&quot; anchored at ranges from and fired 144 rounds, Lieutenant Commander George Belknap claiming to have dismounted two Confederate guns. The ship was hit four times, but suffered no casualties and no significant damage. On 13–15 January 1865, during the second attack, &quot;Canonicus&quot; fired 279 shells at the fort, most on the first day, again claiming to have dismounted two guns. She was hit at least 38 times in return but was only lightly damaged, and three crewmen were wounded. The ship&#x27;s flag was twice shot away and replaced each time by Quartermaster Daniel D. Stevens. Stevens was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

On 17 January 1865, &quot;Canonicus&quot;, towed by the steam sloop-of-war , was ordered to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Charleston, on 19 January. The following month, &quot;Canonicus&quot; and the monitors and captured a blockade runner that had run aground on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, on the night of 18 February. The ship, towed by the steamer , together with &quot;Monadnock&quot; and other ships steamed to Havana, Cuba, in late May, in search of and arrived there after the ship had been turned over to the Spanish authorities by her captain. The two monitors were the first American ironclads to arrive at a foreign port. They returned to the United States, on 6 June.

&quot;Canonicus&quot; arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, on 25 June 1869, and was decommissioned five days later. The ship was renamed &quot;Scylla&quot; on 15 June 1869, but resumed her former name on 10 August 1869. She was recommissioned on 22 January 1872, and cruised the coastal waters of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico whenever she was in commission. &quot;Canonicus&quot; was finally decommissioned in 1877, at Pensacola, Florida. The elderly monitor was towed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, in mid-1907, as an exhibit during the Jamestown Exposition as the last survivor of the Civil War monitors. &quot;Canonicus&quot; was sold for scrap on 19 February 1908.

<doc id="1180134" wikidata="Q232603" url="?curid=1180134" title="Pied imperial pigeon">
<text>The pied imperial pigeon (Ducula bicolor) is a relatively large, pied species of pigeon. It is found in forest, woodland, mangrove, plantations and scrub in Southeast Asia, ranging from Myanmar and Thailand, throughout Indonesia and east to the Philippines (where it is locally known as camasu and balud-puti) and the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula in New Guinea. It is mainly found on small islands and in coastal regions. It remains locally common, and is therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.

==Taxonomy==
Its taxonomy is confusing and remains unsettled. It has sometimes included the Torresian, yellowish and silver-tipped imperial pigeons as subspecies. The widespread nominate subspecies of the pied imperial pigeon differs from all these by its plain white thighs and undertail coverts (though often with a dark spot at the very tip), and its narrowly dark-tipped bluish bill. For comparison, the other species&#x27; have black-spotted undertail coverts and thighs (spotting mainly near thighs in silver-tipped imperial pigeon), the bill of the Torresian imperial pigeon is greenish-yellow, and the bills of the yellowish and silver-tipped imperial pigeons are bluish at the base and yellowish at the tip. Furthermore, the yellowish imperial pigeon has a distinctive yellowish tinge to its plumage (some pied imperial pigeons may also appear yellowish, but infrequently to the same extent), and the silver-tipped imperial pigeon has silvery-grey remiges. However, the subspecies &quot;D. b. melanura&quot; of the Moluccas, which usually is considered a subspecies of the pied imperial pigeon, resembles the Torresian imperial pigeon in bill, thighs and undertail coverts, but has a significantly broader black tail-tip. Consequently, some have suggested it should be placed under the Torresian imperial pigeon, while others have suggested it should be considered an entirely separate species, &quot;D. melanura&quot; (for which the name black imperial pigeon has been used – an unfortunate choice, as only the tail has significantly more black than the other members of this group, and the name black imperial pigeon usually has been used for &quot;D. melanochroa&quot;). Yet others have considered &quot;melanura&quot; to be invalid, instead believing it only is a morph of &quot;D. b. bicolor&quot;, as both types can be found on some islands.

<doc id="1180135" wikidata="Q489240" url="?curid=1180135" title="Dongdaemun Stadium">
<text>Dongdaemun Stadium () was a sports complex in Seoul, South Korea and included a multi-purpose stadium, a baseball park and other sports facilities. It was located near Dongdaemun or Great East Gate. The surrounding Dongdaemun market had many vendors selling athletics-related goods. It was demolished in 2008 to make way for the Dongdaemun Design Plaza &amp; Park.

==History==
Construction on the main athletics stadium and baseball field began on 24 May 1925 and was opened for use on 15 October 1925 as Keijō Stadium. The venue was the main center for sports events in the city, and along with Kirim Stadium in Pyongyang, it was one of the two venues used in the Gyeongsung-Pyongyang inter-city soccer tournament in the 1930s.

The stadium was the location for mass celebrations of the end of Japanese colonial rule, as almost 250,000 citizens gathered at the venue on 15 August 1945, to celebrate the liberation of the peninsula.

Additional construction was undertaken in 1962 to modernize the two existing venues as well as to create a swimming pool, volleyball courts and soft clay tennis courts. Floodlights were added to the baseball venue in 1966 and to the athletics venue in 1968 to allow for nighttime sporting events.

Before its demolition, the athletics stadium was used as a flea market where all types of new and second-hand goods were sold. It formed part of the massive Dongdaemun shopping district, which had been active for 57 years.

== Facilities ==
=== Football ===
The main multi-purpose stadium remained the main center for sports events in Seoul until the Seoul Sports Complex was built for the 1988 Olympic Games. It was the home venue for the South Korea national football team from the 1950s to the late 1980s, though it continued to be used into the 1990s until the last international match was played there, against Myanmar in 2000.

The 30,000-seat main stadium also hosted some football matches including the quarter-finals at the 1988 Summer Olympics and many matches of the Korea Cup, an international football competition.

The inaugural match of the K League, the first professional football league in South Korea, was held at the athletics venue on 8 May 1983. Ilhwa Chunma (currently Seongnam FC), LG Cheetahs (currently FC Seoul), and Yukong Elephants (currently Jeju United FC) were based at the stadium until 1995, but with the decentralization policy in K League, they relocated away to their current stadiums in 1996.

=== Others === 
The inaugural match of the Korean baseball league was held at Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium in 1982.

<text>Aimee Bender (born June 28, 1969) is an American novelist and short story writer, known for her surreal stories and characters. She is a 2011 recipient of the Alex Awards.

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family, Bender received her undergraduate degree from the University of California at San Diego, and a Master of Fine Arts from the creative writing MFA program at University of California at Irvine. While at UCI she studied with Judith Grossman and Geoffrey Wolff. She received ArtsBridge scholarships and worked with mentor Keith Fowler to create writing programs for K-12 students in Orange County, California. She currently teaches creative writing at the University of Southern California where she served as Director of the USC PhD in Creative Writing &amp; Literature from 2012 to 2015. In the past, she taught a class in surrealist writing at the UCLA Extension Writers&#x27; Program and was a senior artist at the non-profit theater workshop The Imagination Workshop, helping mentally ill and at-risk individuals write, direct and act in their own theatrical creations. She has named Oscar Wilde, Hans Christian Andersen, the Brothers Grimm and Anne Sexton as influences on her writing. A native of Los Angeles, Bender is a close friend of fellow UCI alumna Alice Sebold. Her sister is novelist and short story writer Karen Bender. 

Her first book was &quot;The Girl in the Flammable Skirt&quot;, a collection of short stories, published in 1998. The book was chosen as a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of 1998 and spent seven weeks on the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bestseller list. Her novel &quot;An Invisible Sign of My Own&quot; was published in 2000, and was named as a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Pick of the Year. In 2005, she published another collection of short stories, &quot;Willful Creatures&quot;, which was nominated by &quot;The Believer&quot; magazine – owned by McSweeney&#x27;s — as one of the Best Books of the Year. Her novella &quot;The Third Elevator&quot; was published in 2009 by Madras Press. Her novel &quot;The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake&quot; was published in 2010 by Doubleday.

Bender has received two Pushcart Prizes, and was nominated for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 2005. Her short story, &quot;Faces&quot; was a 2009 Shirley Jackson Award finalist. In 2009, Bender became the sitting judge for the Flatmancrooked Writing Prize, a writing award from Flatmancrooked Publishing for new short fiction.

Bender&#x27;s works have also been published in &quot;Granta&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Tin House&quot;, &quot;Opium Magazine&quot;, &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;The Coffin Factory&quot;, and several anthologies. She has also been heard on &quot;This American Life&quot; and &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;.

<doc id="1180141" wikidata="Q4785100" url="?curid=1180141" title="Arcadia, Gulf Coast and Lakeland Railroad">
<text>The Arcadia, Gulf Coast and Lakeland Railroad Company was owned by George B. Morton, Anthony Peters and Woodward Emery. It was incorporated under Florida state law chapter FOO, approved May 21, 1891, &quot;for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a railroad from a point on or near Gasparilla Island, in the county of Lee, via the town of Arcadia, in the county of DeSoto, to Plant City, in the county of Hillsborough, and to the city of Lakeland, in the county of Polk, with such extensions and branches as they may deem necessary&quot;. The railroad was promised land grants along its line. The company managed to operate a short 9-mile stretch of track between Bradenton and Sarasota.

==Amendment==
Florida state law chapter 4259, approved May 30, 1893, extended the incorporation, due to the railroad not being able to complete its line in the time allotted, though it was already running trains on part of the route. The railroad then had two years from May 30, 1893, to complete the railroad; any sections built after then would not receive land grants. The amendment also gave them the right &quot;to change their line of railway, so that the road will begin in Lee county, Florida, at or near the mouth of Charlotte Harbor, at or near a point known as Gasparilla Island; and that its line shall run via the town of Arcadia, in the county of DeSoto, to Plant City and Lakeland, in the counties of Hillsborough and Polk; and that the company shall have the right to build such extensions and branch lines as the board of directors shall find from time to time necessary&quot;.

==Successors==
The Arcadia, Gulf Coast and Lakeland Railroad was taken over by the Florida, Peninsular and Gulf Railroad in 1893 but ceased operations in 1896. The Seaboard Air Line Railroad later built their line from Durant to Sarasota in 1903 using some of the former right of way.

<doc id="1180147" wikidata="Q1869774" url="?curid=1180147" title="Lophophore">
<text>The lophophore () is a characteristic feeding organ possessed by four major groups of animals: the Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Hyolitha, and Phoronida, which collectively constitute the protostome group Lophophorata. All lophophores are found in aquatic organisms.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lophophore&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;lophos&quot; (crest, tuft) and &quot;-phore&quot;, &quot;-phoros&quot; (φορος) (bearing), a derivative of &quot;phérein&quot; (φέρειν) (to bear); thus crest-bearing.

==Characteristics==
The lophophore can most easily be described as a ring of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth, but it is often horseshoe-shaped or coiled. Phoronids have their lophophores in plain view, but the valves of brachiopods must be opened wide to get a good view of their lophophore.

The lophophore surrounds the mouth and is an upstream collecting system for suspension feeding. Its tentacles are hollow, with extensions of a coelomic space thought to be a mesocoel. The gut is U-shaped with the anterior mouth at the center of the lophophore. The anus, where present, is also anterior, but is dorsal to the mouth. In the Bryozoa, it is outside the ring of the lophophore. The inarticulate brachiopods do not have an anus.

==Classification of lophophorates==
Groups with lophophores are called lophophorates. In the old view of metazoan phylogeny, the lophophorates were placed within the Deuterostomia. Now, they have been reassessed and placed in a new superphylum known as the Lophotrochozoa in the Protostomia, which includes the Mollusca and Annelida.

Newer phylogeny place the bryozoans in the group Polyzoa, which also includes entoproctans and Cycliophora, while molluscs, brachiozoans and annelids make up their own group, with brachiozoans and annelids as possible sister taxa.

The extinct hederelloids, microconchids, cornulitids, and tentaculitids were likely lophophorates based on their biomineralization.

The position of the Hyolitha has long been disputed, but as of 2017, it has been assigned to the Lophophorata as finely-preserved specimens in the Burgess Shale can be seen to carry lophophores. Lophophorates did appear paraphyletic, but that is contested.

<doc id="1180149" wikidata="Q809756" url="?curid=1180149" title="Basal lamina">
<text>The basal lamina is a layer of extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells, on which the epithelium sits. It is often incorrectly referred to as the basement membrane, though it does constitute a portion of the basement membrane. The basal lamina is visible only with the electron microscope, where it appears as an electron-dense layer that is 20–100 nm thick (with some exceptions that are thicker, such as basal lamina in lung alveoli and renal glomeruli).

==Structure==
The layers of the basal lamina (&quot;BL&quot;) and those of the basement membrane (&quot;BM&quot;) are described below:

Anchoring fibrils composed of type VII collagen extend from the basal lamina into the underlying reticular lamina and loop around collagen bundles. Although found beneath all basal laminae, they are especially numerous in stratified squamous cells of the skin.

These layers should not be confused with the lamina propria, which is found outside the basal lamina.

===Basement membrane===

The basement membrane is visible under light microscopy. Electron microscopy shows that the basement membrane consists of three layers: the lamina lucida (electron-lucent), lamina densa (electron-dense), and lamina fibro-reticularis (electron-lucent).

The lamina densa was formerly called the “basal lamina”. The terms “basal lamina” and “basement membrane” were often used interchangeably, until it was realised that all three layers seen with the electron microscope constituted the single layer seen with the light microscope. This has led to considerable terminological confusion; if used, the term “basal lamina” should be confined to its meaning as lamina densa.

Some theorize that the lamina lucida is an artifact created when preparing the tissue, and that the lamina lucida is therefore equal to the lamina densa in vivo.

The term &quot;basal lamina&quot; is usually used with electron microscopy, while the term &quot;basement membrane&quot; is usually used with light microscopy.

Examples of basement membranes include:
* Basilar membrane
* Bruch&#x27;s membrane
* Descemet&#x27;s membrane
* Glomerular basement membrane

The glomerular basement membrane is a special case, consisting of a fusion of the podocyte and endothelial basal laminas, and lacking a lamina reticularis. Thus, it consists of an especially thick lamina densa, sandwiched on its inside and outside by layers of lamina lucida / rara (one from each cell type). These two enveloping layers are often referred to as lamina rara &quot;externa&quot; and lamina rara &quot;interna&quot;.

==Function==
The basal lamina is made and maintained by the cells that sit on it. It acts as a point of attachment for cells. However, it can also have other function such as a permeability barrier in the glomerulus (urine production). Some of the matrix molecules (of the basal lamina) mediate synaptic adhesion in neuromuscular synapses.

Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the COL4A3/4/5 genes. These genes are important in collagen IV synthesis and basement membrane formation. In individuals with this syndrome the basement membrane in structures such as the glomerulus, ears, and eyes does not function properly, causing symptoms such as blood in the urine, loss of hearing, and vision problems.

<text>Haxey&#x27;s case (1397) &quot;Rotuli Parliamentorum&quot; (iii) 434, is a UK constitutional law case that established the right to free speech within Parliament.

==Facts==
In January 1397, Sir Thomas Haxey presented a petition to Parliament, criticising the costs of King Richard II of England&#x27;s household. The king was affronted and, with the collusion of Thomas Arundel, insisted that Haxey be punished for treason. Haxey was deprived of his title and his possessions. However, the king went on to pardon Haxey, and it has been suggested that the case was deliberately orchestrated to criminalize criticism of the king.

==Judgment==
On deposing Richard in 1399, Henry IV of England successfully petitioned Parliament to reverse its judgment against Haxey as &quot;…against the law and custom which had been before in Parliament.&quot;

<text>The World of Disney is the flagship chain of specialty retail stores owned and operated by the merchandise division of Disney Experiences, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. Currently, there are four locations that sell Disney products. 

==Background==
Disney had entered the retailing field outside of the parks with the first Disney Store opened in the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California on March 28, 1987. In 1994, Disney Stores opened its flagship location in New York City at a corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue. 

The World of Disney has always been operated as part of Disney Parks and is not associated with the Disney Store.

==Locations==
The current operating locations are all located at the shopping districts of Disney theme park resorts and do not require tickets or park entry.
*Orlando, United States – Walt Disney World Resort – Disney Springs
*Anaheim, United States – Disneyland Resort – Downtown Disney
*Paris, France – Disneyland Paris – Disney Village
*Shanghai, China – Shanghai Disney Resort – Disneytown

A store following the same concept operates as Bon Voyage! at Tokyo Disney Resort, on the way between Tokyo Disneyland and Maihama Station.

==History==
The first World of Disney store opened October 2, 1996 in the Disney Village Marketplace (currently Disney Springs) at Walt Disney World Resort. At approximately of retail space, it is said to offer the largest selection of Disney character merchandise in the world, according to the company. A 2006 renovation added a small princess-themed salon called Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, plus a new children&#x27;s merchandise area inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean and Stitch. The Boutique was moved out of this store with the Disney Springs overhaul of Downtown Disney in mid to late 2016 to Once Upon a Toy store, located in the Marketplace section.

A second, 40,000 square feet location opened on January 1, 2001, coinciding with the opening of Downtown Disney of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim.
On October 5, 2004, a third location opened within a three-story New York City (30,000-square-foot) space formerly occupied by the flagship Disney Store on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue as the rest of the Disney Store chain in the US was sold. The store closed on December 31, 2009, and the interior was dismantled on January 4, 2010 to make way for a traditional Disney Store in Times Square in fall 2010 at the former Virgin Megastore location. The rental cost for the location had become unreasonable and Disney had purchased back the US Disney Stores.

Disney Parks&#x27; merchandising department added another retail location, Disney Vault 28, its first high-end apparel store, which opened on October 11, 2006 in Downtown Disney. Vault 28 was closed down by the end of September 2017.

An additional location opened at Disney Village in Disneyland Paris on July 12, 2012, the third location currently in operation. The 1,400 square-meters (15,000 square feet) store was a part of a major overhaul for the village. The newest World of Disney location opened in the Disneytown area of the Shanghai Disney Resort at the park&#x27;s opening on June 14, 2016, bringing the total to four stores in operation.

The flagship store at Downtown Disney in Anaheim started a remodel in 2017 by PCL Construction with a soft reopening on October 19 and a grand opening on October 26, 2018. The remodeling added a back story to the location that it was &quot;a bus depot turned into an animation studio for Disney artists.&quot; The Disney Springs location was also remodeled with its grand reopening on October 27.
