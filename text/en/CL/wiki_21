<text>Didsbury is a suburb of Manchester, England, on the north bank of the River Mersey, south of Manchester city centre. The population at the 2011 census was 26,788.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, there are records of Didsbury existing as a small hamlet as early as the 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 a section of the Jacobite army including the Duke of Perth crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby.

Didsbury was largely rural until the mid-19th century, when it underwent development and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution. It became part of Manchester in 1904.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was formed in Didsbury in 1889.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Dyddi&#x27;s burg&quot;, probably referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.

=== Parish church ===

A charter granted in about 1260 shows that a corn-grinding mill was operating in Didsbury, along the River Mersey, but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235, recording a grant of land for the building of a chapel. The church was named St James Church in 1855. It underwent major refurbishment in 1620 and again in the 19th century, although most of the stonework visible today dates from the 17th century. A parsonage was built next to one of the two public houses that flanked the nearby village green, Ye Olde Cock Inn, so-called because of the cockfighting that used to take place there. The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted; servants refused to sleep on the premises, and it was abandoned in 1850. Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865, and lived in it for more than 40 years. In 1902, he installed a gateway complete with wrought iron gates which he purchased from the soon to be demolished Spread Eagle Hotel in central Manchester which he once owned, at the entrance to the parsonage&#x27;s garden, which, because of the building&#x27;s reputation, became known locally as &quot;the gates to Hell&quot;. The parsonage is now open to the community and used as exhibition rooms for various forms of art. The gardens are still open to the public. The area around St James&#x27; Church has the highest concentration of listed buildings in Manchester, outside the city centre.

=== River Mersey ===
Didsbury was one of the few places between Stretford and Stockport where the River Mersey could be forded, which made it significant for troop movements during the English Civil War, in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side. The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. A section of the Jacobite army including the Duke of Perth crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745 in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby. Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed at Stockport.

=== Immigration from Europe ===
Jewish immigrants started to arrive in Manchester from the late 18th century, initially settling mainly in the suburbs to the north of the city. From the 1890s onwards, many of them moved to what were seen as the more &quot;sophisticated&quot; suburbs in the south, such as Withington and Didsbury. The influx of Jewish immigrants led to West Didsbury being nicknamed &quot;Yidsbury&quot; and Palatine Road, a main road through West Didsbury, &quot;Palestine Road&quot;.

A growing population of German merchants and industrialists in the mid-19th century earned Manchester the nickname of &quot;the German city&quot;. In the Didsbury area, the Souchays were a well-known merchant family of Huguenot descent with connections to Germany. John D. Souchay built Eltville House, a large residence on the corner of Fog Lane and Wilmslow Road (a site bounded today by Clayton Avenue and Clothorn Road). The house, named after Eltville in Germany, had a pair of gate lodges at its Wilmslow Road entrance and the Ball Brook ran through its large garden. Other members of the family, Charles (or Carl) and Adelaide (or Adelheid) Souchay, lived nearby at Withington House on Wilmslow Road (the present site of the telephone exchange at Old Broadway). The Souchays were related to Cécile Mendelssohn Bartholdy, wife of the German composer Felix Mendelssohn. In the 1840s, Mendelssohn made several visits to Britain and stayed with the Souchays; he wrote a number of letter to friends with &quot;Eltville House, Withington&quot; as the return address. The Souchays were members of St Paul&#x27;s Church, Withington; Mendelssohn gave a recital on the newly installed pipe organ there in 1847, and the first wedding to take place there was that of John Souchay&#x27;s eldest daughter in 1850. The Souchays are buried in St Paul&#x27;s churchyard. Eltville House was purchased by Jame Clayton Chorlton in 1888 and he renamed it Didsbury Priory. The Chorltons often opened their private garden to the public during springtime.

Among the other German industrialists in Didsbury was Johann Georg Silkenstadt, a cotton merchant who moved to the area from Bremen in 1865. He and his wife Josephine Helene built Rose Bank on Palatine Road in West Didsbury in 1872. Their only daughter, Marie Louise, married William Murray Caldwell Greaves Bagshawe of Ford Hall in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire. The Silkenstadts built for Greystoke Hall as a wedding present for them next to their family home. Marie Louise died of peritonitis in 1891, and her father died the following year. The grieving Josephine Silkenstadt created a public botanical garden opposite their house, named &quot;Marie Louise Gardens&quot; in memory of her late daughter, and bequeathed it to Withington Urban District Council. The gardens and the Lodge were designed by the civil engineer Joshua Cartwright, and were formally opened in June 1903 by James Kenyon.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

During the Victorian expansion of Manchester, Didsbury developed as a prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood to the east and Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Manchester South District Line by the Midland Railway in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury. Easy rail connections to were now provided from Didsbury railway station in Didsbury Village, and from Withington and West Didsbury railway station on Palatine Road. Didsbury station was also served by Express trains from Manchester to London St Pancras. Further expansion of the railways ensued when the London &amp; North Western Railway&#x27;s Styal Line from Manchester London Road to opened in 1909, introducing two new stations to the area, East Didsbury &amp; Parrs Wood and . In 1910, A stone clock tower and water fountain was erected outside Didsbury Midland Railway station in memory of local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr John Milson Rhodes.
On 28 April 1910, French pilot Louis Paulhan landed his Farman biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm, on the borders of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury, at the end of the first flight from London to Manchester in under 24 hours, with one short overnight stop at Lichfield. Arriving at 5:30 am, Paulhan beat the British contender, Claude Grahame-White, winning a £10,000 prize offered by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. This was the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city. Two special trains were chartered to the newly built but unopened Burnage railway station to take spectators to the landing, many of whom had stood throughout the night. Paulhan&#x27;s progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife, Henri Farman and his mechanics. Afterwards, his train took the party to a civic reception given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in the town hall. A house in Paulhan Road, constructed in the 1930s near the site of his landing, is marked by a blue plaque to commemorate his achievement.

In 1921, a war memorial was erected outside Didsbury Library, on the opposite side of the road to the Midland Railway station. Dedicated to the memory of the 174 local servicemen who fell in World War I, it was unveiled by Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. After World War II, a further 67 names were added.

Further transport enhancements came in the form of two new arterial roads which were constructed at the peripheral edges of Didsbury 1928–1930: Kingsway (named after King George V) through East Didsbury; and Princess Road through West Didsbury. Both were laid out as dual carriageways for motor vehicles with a segregated tram track along the central reservation. Manchester Corporation Tramways operated a tram line from Parrs Wood via Burnage into Manchester city centre until 1949, when the service was closed.

In the postwar years, passenger train services on the South District Line (now part of British Rail) were gradually reduced, and in 1967 the line was closed as part of the Beeching cuts. For some years the old station building was in use as Station Hardware and DIY store, before it was demolished in 1982.

== Governance ==
=== Civic history ===
In the early 13th century, Didsbury lay within the manor of Withington, a feudal estate that also included the townships of Withington, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Moss Side, Rusholme, Burnage, Denton and Haughton, ruled by the Hathersage, Longford and Tatton families, and within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Didsbury remained within the manor of Withington for several centuries.

By 1764, Didsbury was described as a township in its own right. It was also a chapelry in Manchester parish. It became a civil parish in 1866, and in 1876 was incorporated into the Withington Urban Sanitary District, superseded in 1894 by the creation of Withington Urban District. Withington Urban District was a subdivision of the administrative county of Lancashire, created as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894. In 1904, Withington Urban District was amalgamated into the city and county borough of Manchester, and so Didsbury was absorbed into Manchester, although it remained a civil parish until 1 October 1910 when it was abolished and merged with South Manchester. In 1901 the parish had a population of 9234. Following the Local Government Act 1972, Manchester became a metropolitan borough of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

=== Political representation ===
Didsbury is in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Withington, and is represented by Jeff Smith MP, a member of the Labour Party.

Until 2004, most of the area formed the Didsbury ward of Manchester City Council with a section of West Didsbury contained within the Barlow Moor ward. However, boundary changes in 2004 resulted in Didsbury being split mainly between the two new wards of Didsbury East and Didsbury West while a small section of West Didsbury was incorporated into the new ward of Chorlton Park. Didsbury East is represented by Labour councillors Linda Foley, James Wilson and Andrew Simcock. Didsbury West is represented by Labour councillors Debbie Hilal and Greg Stanton, and Liberal Democrat councillor John Leech. All wards within Manchester elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle.

== Geography ==

Didsbury, at (53.4166, −2.2311), is south of the midpoint of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, south of Manchester city centre. To the north, Didsbury is bordered by Withington, Chorlton-cum-Hardy and Burnage, to the west by Northenden, to the east and south-east by Heaton Mersey and Cheadle, and by Gatley to the south.

The River Mersey forms Didsbury&#x27;s southern and southwestern boundaries and certain stretches of the river also demarcate the boundaries of the City of Manchester. The area is generally considered to be roughly enclosed by Princess Parkway to the west, Kingsway to the east and the Ball Brook, just north of Lapwing Lane/Fog Lane to the north. This northern boundary is marked by a boundary stone in the front garden wall of a house on the west side of Wilmslow Road. A &quot;country trail&quot; passes from West Didsbury to East, named the Trans Pennine Trail (National Cycle Route 62). It was sited along a disused railway track, as part of a nationwide initiative to promote cycling.

Didsbury&#x27;s built environment has developed around the areas of East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river&#x27;s flood plain, and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped to speed up the passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river. Parts of the local flood plain, much of Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden, the whole of nearby Didsbury Park and many of the listed buildings in the area are grouped into the St. James&#x27; Conservation area, which is centred on Wilmslow Road, just south of Didsbury Village.

== Demography ==
The United Kingdom Census 2001 recorded Didsbury as having a population of 14,292, of whom 87% were born in the United Kingdom. A large majority of residents, 88%, identified themselves as white, 8% as Asian, 2% as mixed ethnicity, 1% black and 1% Chinese or other ethnic group. The under-16s accounted for 17% of the population, and the over-65s for 15%. The population density in 2001 was 5,276/square mile (2,037/km2). In May 2021 a claim published by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that Didsbury was among a number of &quot;no-go areas for white people&quot; attracted media criticism.



== Economy ==
As of the UK&#x27;s 2001 census, Didsbury had an estimated workforce of 10,755 or 75% of the population. Economic status in Didsbury was: 48% in full-time employment, 11% retired, 10% self-employed, 8% in part-time employment, 4% full-time student (without job), 4% housewife/husband or carer, 4% permanently sick or disabled, 4% unemployed and 2% economically inactive for unstated reasons. Didsbury&#x27;s 48% rate of full-time employment compares with 33% in Manchester and 41% across the whole of England. The area&#x27;s 4% unemployment rate is in contrast to Manchester&#x27;s rate of 9% and broadly in line with the 5% rate of unemployment for England.

In 2001, the main industries of employment in Didsbury were 20% property and business services, 15% education, 15% health and social work, 10% retail and wholesale, 9% manufacturing, 6% transport and communications, 5% financial services, 4% hotels and restaurants, 4% construction, 4% public administration and defence, and 8% other. These figures were similar to those from surrounding areas, but Didsbury did have a relatively larger education sector than other nearby wards, perhaps explained by the high density of schools in the area. A significant number of people (12%) commute to areas outside Didsbury; at the 2001 census there were 6,555 jobs in Didsbury, compared with the 7,417 employed residents.

Siemens&#x27; UK head office is in West Didsbury, occupying Sir William Siemens House and the Turing building, employing around 800 people here.
The head office of BA CityFlyer is in Didsbury. British Airways has an office with 300 employees in Pioneer House on the 292,000 square feet (27,100 m2), Dutch-owned Towers Business Park. In 2005, other tenants of the business park included Cisco, IWG, Logica, Trinity Integrated Systems and Thorn Lighting.

Didsbury is considered to form a &#x27;stockbroker belt&#x27;, as it is Manchester&#x27;s most affluent suburb.

== Culture ==
The original site of Didsbury Village is in the conservation area now known as Didsbury St James, about half a mile (1 km) to the south of what is today&#x27;s village centre. The old village green is now the beer garden of The Didsbury pub.

The traditional independent retailers are gradually being replaced by multi-national firms, raising fears that Didsbury may lose its individual identity and become a &quot;clone town&quot;. However, independent traders continue to thrive, especially along Burton Road in West Didsbury, which celebrates its independent spirit each year with the two-day Westfest festival. The 200-year-old Peacock&#x27;s Funeral Parlour, one of the few pre-Victorian buildings in the village and regarded by some as the centrepiece of the village, was demolished in the summer of 2005 to make way for a new branch of Boots the Chemists. The owner, United Co-op, blamed changing demographics for the closure of the funeral parlour; with more and more homes being occupied by young professional people, the death rate was falling in the area.
=== Green areas ===
The Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden is a recreational park south of the village centre. It is named after local Alderman Fletcher Moss, who donated the park to the city of Manchester in 1919. In 2008, it won the Green Flag Award, the national standard for parks and green spaces in England, an award it has held since 2000.

Alderman Fletcher Moss was also responsible for restoring the gardens surrounding the old parsonage of St James&#x27;s Church. Today, the Parsonage Gardens are open to the public, and the former parsonage house is now in use as an art gallery and community building.

Didsbury Park is a community park located close to the centre of Didsbury village, surrounded by residential housing. It is one of the first municipal planned parks in the city, redesigned in the 1920s to include recreational features for residents, such as bowling greens. Located within the St. James’ Conservation Area, it features preservation-order trees, grassland, woodland, and flora. An old air-raid shelter is rumoured to be beneath the football pitch. The park includes a children&#x27;s playground, a football pitch, and bowling greens. Didsbury Park was also a winner of the Green Flag Award in 2008. The park is used for dog walking, recreational play, picnics, and hosts events like the Didsbury Festival and Classic Car show. &#x27;Didsbury Good Neighbours&#x27;, a charity, is based in the park&#x27;s refurbished pavilion, and operates an on-site cafe. The upkeep of the park is managed by the volunteer group, The Friends of Didsbury Park.

Marie Louise Gardens is a relatively small park to the west of the centre of Didsbury, opened in 1903 in memory of Marie Louise Silkenstadt. The gardens are planted out with a number of rare and unusual tree species. The park was at the centre of controversy in 2007 after Manchester City Council proposed to sell a portion of it to a private property developer.

In the northern part of Didsbury lies Fog Lane Park, a large municipal green space which borders on Withington and Burnage. The park, which features playing fields and ornamental gardens, was established in 1926 by the Manchester Corporation. The park also contains basketball courts, tennis courts, a skate park and a children&#x27;s play area. Fog Lane takes its name from Yorkshire-fog, a type of wild grass.

== Media ==
Between 1956 and 1969, the old Capitol Theatre at the junction of Parrs Wood Road and School Lane served as the northern studios of ITV station ABC Weekend Television. Programmes such as &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; and &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; were made in the studios. ABC ceased to use the site in 1968 when it lost its ITV franchise, on its merger with fellow ITV company Rediffusion. The site was then used briefly by Yorkshire Television until its own facilities in Leeds were ready. In 1971, the studios were acquired by Manchester Polytechnic, who used it for cinema, television studies and theatre. The building was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for a residential development, but the name lives on in the form of a new theatre space in the heart of the M.M.U. campus in the All Saints area along Oxford Road, just to the south of Manchester city centre.

Until 2009 Didsbury was the base for one of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; subsidiaries, the &quot;South Manchester Reporter&quot;.

== Transport ==


===Roads===
Didsbury is close to junction 5 of Manchester&#x27;s ring road, the M60 motorway.

===Air===
Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the UK outside London, is situated about 4 miles (6.5 km) to the south.

===Bus===
Didsbury is served by bus routes on the Wilmslow Road bus corridor, said to be the busiest bus corridor in Europe.
There are frequent bus services into Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Northenden and other destinations. Services include:
* 23: Stockport – Didsbury – Chorlton-cum-Hardy – Stretford – Urmston – Trafford Centre.
* 42: Stockport – Didsbury – Withington – Manchester Royal Infirmary – Manchester.

===Railway===
The nearest commuter railway stations to Didsbury are and on the Styal Line, which runs between and . The stations were opened in 1909 by the London and North Western Railway. East Didsbury is served additionally by regional trains to destinations including , , and .

Until the 1960s, the suburb was also served by two stations on the South District Line from : station on Lapwing Lane (closed in 1961) and Didsbury station (closed in 1967, during the Beeching Axe). Both stations have since been demolished, although new stops on Manchester&#x27;s Metrolink have since risen in their place.

=== Metrolink ===

The area is served by the Manchester Metrolink light rail/tram with four tram stops at , , and .

The tram route uses a reopened section of the former Midland Railway line. Proposals were first announced in 1984 to reopen the disused line as part of the &quot;Project Light Rail&quot; scheme and the former Didsbury station was to reopen under the name of Didsbury Central or Didsbury Village. The first phase of the Manchester Metrolink light rail/tram system opened in 1992 but, due to funding problems, the old trackbed through Didsbury remained derelict for over 20 years until it was reopened in 2013. Rather than reopening at the site of the old Midland Railway station on Wilmslow Road, it was decided instead to locate the new Didsbury Village tram stop further down the line at School Lane.

== Education ==
Didsbury has a non-selective education system, assessed by the SATs exam. There are seven primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School is one of those chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government&#x27;s Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951. Parrs Wood and The Barlow were two of only six schools in Manchester to achieve the Manchester Inclusion Standard in 2007, awarded by Manchester Council to those schools doing innovative work to ensure that all their pupils are able to participate fully in the school&#x27;s activities.

There is one centre of further and higher education in Didsbury: The Manchester College, (formerly City College Manchester) Fielden Campus, which was opened in 1972 by Margaret Thatcher, offers a variety of courses including communication and technology. Manchester Metropolitan University&#x27;s Didsbury Campus, the former Didsbury School of Education, was home to the faculties of health, social care, and education, along with the Broomhurst Hall of Residence. The University closed the campus and sold the land in 2014.

=== Primary schools ===

* Beaver Road Primary School
* Broad Oak Primary School

* St Ambrose RC Primary School

=== Secondary schools ===

* Parrs Wood High School

Parrs Wood, with about 2,000 pupils on its register, is much larger than the average, and is regularly over-subscribed in Year 7. In its 2007 inspection report by the Office for Standards in Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills (Ofsted) the school was criticised for &quot;failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education&quot;, and for providing &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; value for money. However, in 2012 it came out of special measures and Ofsted deemed it a &quot;satisfactory&quot; school with aspects of &quot;good teaching&quot; and &quot;good management&quot;.

* The Barlow RC High School

The Barlow RC High School is an average size secondary school, with about 1,000 pupils. It too is regularly over-subscribed. It was described in its October 2003 Ofsted report as &quot;a successful and effective school that is providing a good education for its pupils&quot;.

=== Special and alternative schools ===
* The Birches School 
* Lancasterian School

== Religion ==
It is uncertain when the first chapel was built in Didsbury, but it is thought to have been before the middle of the 13th century. When the plague reached the village in 1352 the chapel yard was consecrated to provide a cemetery for the victims, it being &quot;inconvenient to carry the dead all the way to Manchester&quot;.

The BBC Radio 4 &quot;Daily Service&quot; programme of Christian worship – the world&#x27;s oldest continuous radio programme – is often broadcast from Emmanuel Church, on Barlow Moor Road. Two of Didsbury&#x27;s religious buildings are Grade II listed: Didsbury Methodist Church of St Paul (now an office building), and the Nazarene Theological College which hosts the Didsbury Lectures. Didsbury was once the location of a Methodist training college, the Wesleyan Theological Institution; the Grade II*-listed building became Didsbury School of Education, part of Manchester Metropolitan University. and has now been converted to private housing.

Didsbury is in the Church of England Diocese of Manchester,
and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. It is not as religiously diverse as some other areas of Manchester, but it has the second largest Jewish population in the borough and two synagogues: the Shaare Hayim Synagogue and the Sha&#x27;are Sedek Synagogue.

Didsbury has a medium-sized Muslim population in comparison with areas such as Rusholme, Longsight and Levenshulme; a converted church in West Didsbury houses the Didsbury Mosque and Islamic Centre.

== Sport ==

Didsbury Sports Centre, on Wilmslow Road, is a part of the Manchester Metropolitan University campus. It provides a fitness suite with classes and facilities for badminton and tennis.

Didsbury has two rugby union clubs, Toc H R.F.C. and Old Bedians. Toc H, founded in 1924, plays at Simons Fields, on Ford Lane. Its first team plays in the North Lancashire and Cumbria league. The club runs four senior teams and a youth section; it has run a 10-a-side competition every May since 1951, as a charity fund raiser for local hospices. Old Bedians is based in East Didsbury and was founded in 1954. It regularly fields three senior teams as well as a junior section. Desmond Pastore, believed to be the oldest rugby player in the world, was a founder member of the club and later became its president. Formerly a player for Sale and Cheshire, Desmond played his last game for Manchester club Egor on his 91st birthday. Bedians AFC, an amateur football club that was founded in 1928, share the Underbank Farm ground with Old Bedians RUFC.

Didsbury Cricket Club fields four Saturday teams, two Women&#x27;s teams and a Sunday team. The 1st XI plays in the Cheshire County ECB Premier League. The Women&#x27;s teams compete in the Cheshire Womens Cricket League, and their junior section play in the Cheshire High Peak Junior Cricket League.

It is also home to Manchester Waconians Lacrosse Club and Didsbury Grey&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Hockey Team, which do not actually play at the site but at grounds in Belle Vue, that were designed for the XVII Commonwealth Games.

Northern Tennis Club, in West Didsbury, is one of Manchester&#x27;s few racquet clubs; it plays host to an Association of Tennis Professionals tournament annually every July.

== Public services ==
Withington Community Hospital, opened in 2005, occupies part of the site of the former (and much larger) Withington Hospital, developed on the site of a workhouse some of whose buildings are still evident.

Didsbury is covered by the South Manchester Division of Greater Manchester Police.

The Towers, formerly the Shirley Institute, was once the home of engineer Daniel Adamson – the driving force behind the Manchester Ship Canal project – and the venue where the decision to build the canal was taken. The house was designed by Salford architect Thomas Worthington, for the editor and proprietor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, John Edward Taylor.

<doc id="1160504" wikidata="Q7885087" url="?curid=1160504" title="Uniform Task-Based Management System">
<text>The Uniform Task-Based Management System (UTBMS) is a set of codes designed to standardize categorization and facilitate the analysis of legal work and expenses. UTBMS was produced through a collaborative effort among the American Bar Association Section of Litigation, the American Corporate Counsel Association, and a group of major corporate clients and law firms coordinated and supported by Price Waterhouse LLP (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). UTBMS codes are now maintained and developed by the Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard (LEDES) Oversight Committee.

==Background==
UTBMS coding is reflected in legal bills sent from a law firm to its corporate clients. Law firms will usually use coding on time and expenses only for those clients who explicitly request it. Most clients who use UTBMS also require electronic billing, usually with an invoice in a LEDES e-billing format.

Fees, which are attorney and legal assistant time charges, are coded with task and activity codes. There are five sets of task codes: Litigation, Intellectual Property, Counseling, Project and Bankruptcy. The set used for a given matter (i.e., case or transaction) depends upon the nature of that matter. Tasks may be summarized into phases. Tasks are often reported without reporting the phase, as this can be deduced from the task. The phase/task hierarchy is uniform in the Litigation, Intellectual Property and Bankruptcy task code sets. In the Project set, only the second phase contains multiple tasks. The Counseling set has only a single level. (In such situations, a code may be considered both a phase and a task, and it may be necessary to program the time and billing software this way.) There is a single set of activity codes, which is used in conjunction with each of the four task code sets. There is also a single set of expense codes, which are independent of phase, task and activity codes.

The codes themselves are composed of a letter (the first letter of the task code set), followed by a three-digit number. Tasks sharing the same letter and first digit belong to the same phase.

From time-to-time, the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC), the administrative body that oversees these codes, adds and changes codes. In 2007, a set of Intellectual Property codes (for patents and trademarks) were finalized and ratified. In 2011, a set of &quot;eDiscovery&quot; codes were ratified. In 2015, the LOC ratified a set of Governance, Risk and Compliance codes based on the Open Compliance &amp; Ethics Group (OCEG) GRC Capability Model.

<text>Arthur John Lee (; born September 30, 1947) is a Canadian politician and lawyer based in British Columbia. He served as a Liberal Party of Canada member of Parliament (MP) representing Vancouver East from 1974 to 1979, and as the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1984 to 1987, becoming the first Chinese Canadian to lead a provincial or federal political party.

==Background==
Art Lee was born in Lethbridge, Alberta. His father ran a business in Edmonton after serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and his great-grandfather worked as a translator during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. After graduating from the University of Alberta Faculty of Law in 1972, he was called to the bar in British Columbia in 1973, and joined the law firm of Frank Lew in Vancouver.

As a fourth-generation Chinese Canadian, Art Lee was not fluent in the Chinese language. After becoming MP, he took Cantonese lessons to facilitate communications with Chinese residents in his constituency.

==Political career==
===Federal politics===
Lee ran as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1974 federal election, winning the riding of Vancouver East against incumbent New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Paddy Neale by just 57 votes. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from 1975 to 1976, and as parliamentary secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada from 1976 to 1977. In the subsequent 1979 election, he lost the seat to NDP candidate Margaret Mitchell, and again in 1980.

===Provincial politics===
After Shirley McLoughlin resigned as leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1983, Lee won the leadership election in 1984 against three opponents. At that time, the party had little popular support due to its association with the federal Liberals, and it held no seats in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly. Lee attempted to enter the legislature by running in the Vancouver East by-election on November 8, 1984, but lost to British Columbia New Democratic Party candidate Bob Williams.

In the 1986 provincial election, Lee ran for one of two seats in Vancouver-Little Mountain alongside fellow Liberal candidate Joyce Statton; the seats were won by incumbent Social Credit candidates Grace McCarthy and Doug Mowat. The Liberals were once again shut out of the legislature, but the party won 6.74% of the popular vote, more than double what they had received in the 1983 election. Thereafter Lee announced his resignation as party leader, staying on until Gordon Wilson was acclaimed as the new Liberal leader in October 1987.

<doc id="1160511" wikidata="Q2463660" url="?curid=1160511" title="Brian Cook (basketball)">
<text>Brian Joshua Cook (born December 4, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player. He was drafted out of the University of Illinois with the 24th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.

In 2004, Cook was named to the University of Illinois All-Century Team.

==High school career==
Cook played high school basketball at Lincoln Community High School in central Illinois where he led the Railsplitters to the quarterfinals of the 1999 Illinois High School Association class AA state boys basketball tournament. Cook scored 38 points in 2 IHSA tournament finals games, averaging 19.0 points per game. He was named to the 1998 State Farm Holiday Classic all-tournament team and was a 1999 McDonald&#x27;s All-American. He was also named the 1999 Illinois Mr. Basketball after averaging 21.7 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.2 blocks, 2.0 steals and 1.8 assists per game as a senior. Cook was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2016.

==College career==

Cook played 132 games in four years for the University of Illinois, most of them under coach Bill Self, and led the Illini in rebounding in each season. Cook was a versatile scorer from both inside and outside the paint, utilizing his height to score in the post and hitting three-point shots when left open. This helped him to earn co-Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors during his freshman year at Illinois.

Cook helped lead the Illini to a number one seed in the 2001 NCAA Tournament, and the Illini cruised to the Elite 8, where they were upset in a hard-fought and controversial game by Cook&#x27;s future teammate Luke Walton and the Arizona Wildcats.

As a senior in the 2002–03 season, Cook led the Fighting Illini in scoring with 20.0 points per game, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball as the Most Outstanding Player of the Big Ten Conference. That same season, Cook was named second team All-American by The Sporting News, and third team All-American by the Associated Press, the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and &quot;The Basketball Times&quot;, as well as Big Ten Player of the Year and first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and the media. Additionally, he would lead the Illini to the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament championship and be named Most Outstanding Player. Cook left Illinois as the school&#x27;s third all-time leading scorer with 1,748 total points, at an average of 13.2 points per game, behind Deon Thomas and Kiwane Garris.

==Professional career==

Cook was selected with the 24th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He played sparingly in his rookie campaign as a backup to superstar center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and was mostly an interior player, notching only five three-point attempts out of 141 total field goal attempts. As his professional career evolved, however, Cook once again became a player who could play beyond the perimeter, after O&#x27;Neal moved on to the Miami Heat and Rudy Tomjanovich took over for Phil Jackson as Lakers&#x27; head coach. He was mainly used as a three-point specialist; 199 of 422 (or 47.2%) of Cook&#x27;s field goal attempts were from behind the three-point arc. When Phil Jackson returned to coach the Lakers in 2005–06, Cook started to take less three-pointers again, which resulted in Cook improving his overall field-goal percentage from .417 in 2004–05 to .520 in 2005–06. It also resulted in an improvement in his three-point field-goal percentage, from .392 in 2004–05 to .441 in 2005–06. His improved play kept Cook on the court more as his minutes played per game rose from 15.1 in 2004–05 to 19.4 in 2005–06.

On November 20, 2007, Cook was traded, along with Maurice Evans, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Trevor Ariza.

On February 19, 2009, Cook was traded to the Houston Rockets in a three-team trade also involving the Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies. On February 20, 2010, he was waived by the Rockets.

On July 9, 2010, Cook signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.

On March 15, 2012, Cook was traded, along with a 2015 second-round pick, to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Nick Young.

Cook&#x27;s final NBA game ever was during his time with the Wizards, as he played his final game on April 26, 2012, in a 104–70 win over the Miami Heat. He recorded 4 points and 1 rebound in his final game. On September 17, 2012, he re-signed with the Wizards. However, he was later waived by the Wizards on October 28, 2012.

In March 2013, Cook signed with Piratas de Quebradillas for the 2013 BSN season.

On September 30, 2013, Cook signed with the Utah Jazz. However, he was later waived by the Jazz on October 26, 2013.

On September 25, 2014, Cook signed with the Detroit Pistons. However, he was later waived by the Pistons on October 20, 2014. On December 28, 2014, he signed with Al-Riyadi of the Lebanese Basketball League. He left Al-Riyadi in mid-January after appearing in just three games. On February 10, 2015, he signed with Aguada of the Liga Uruguaya de Basketball, in Montevideo, Uruguay. He also managed just three games for Aguada.

On June 15, 2015, Cook signed with Chiba Jets of the Japanese National Basketball League.

==Personal life==
Cook is the son of Norman and Joyce Cook, and has two younger sisters, Kristina and Natasha. His father was an All-American with the University of Kansas and played briefly for the Boston Celtics. His uncle, Joe Cook, played basketball for Duke University from 1988 to 1990.

On July 4, 2009, Cook married long-time girlfriend, Victoria Velasquez.

Cook has played in the BIG3 basketball league as a member of the Killer 3&#x27;s team.

<doc id="1160520" wikidata="Q15253384" url="?curid=1160520" title="Miles Platting">
<text>Miles Platting is an inner city part of Manchester, England, northeast of Manchester city centre along the 
Rochdale Canal and A62 road, bounded by Monsall to the north, Collyhurst to the west, Newton Heath to the east, and Bradford, Holt Town and Ancoats to the south.

Historically part of the township of Newton Heath, Lancashire, Miles Platting expanded into a factory district as a result of the Industrial Revolution. That industrial growth resulted in a population that became very large for the size of the district, resulting in densely packed terraced housing that had degenerated into slums by 1950. As a result of this, crime rose and the area became an economically deprived part of the city.

Miles Platting has undergone extensive redevelopment and regeneration, with former slum terraces removed to make way for council housing.

==History==
Miles Platting first appeared on a map in 1790
at the point where Oldham Road crossed Newton Brook
and a track led to Collyhurst Hall. The track became Collyhurst Street and the track on the opposite side of Oldham Road became Varley Street.

The name is derived from platting, a local word, meaning a small bridge across a stream. The Court leet records of the manor of Manchester dated 13 October 1742 record &quot;Mr Henry Booth for suffering his Platting leading from Tib Lane into the Long Pitfield to lye broken in such manner that severall persons have fall&#x27;n and been ill brused&quot;. The footnote says &quot;Platting, a local word, meaning a small bridge across a stream&quot;.
This platting was a mile from Manchester (measured from New Cross at the bottom of Oldham Road). Hence Miles Platting.

Miles Platting had many mills towards the end of 19th century: Holland Mill, Victoria Mill and Ducie Mill were among the largest. By the 1870s a chemical works, timber yard, gas works and a tannery were also operating in the area alongside the many mills. This volume of industry in such a relatively small area inevitably led to the construction of densely packed back-to-back housing to provide homes for the necessary workforce. By the middle of the 20th century, with the decline in manufacturing industry and the closure of its local industries, Miles Platting had become a slum area inhabited by a deprived community. Today, Miles Platting contains just under 2,000 housing units, many of them managed by Adactus Housing Association on behalf of Manchester City Council, including 12 multi-storey blocks.
The area, once recognised as being amongst the most deprived in the UK, has benefited from the substantial urban regeneration scheme for east Manchester initiated in the late 1990s.

Miles Platting railway station lay at the junction of the lines from Manchester Victoria to Oldham and Stalybridge, but this closed in 1995, and the station was subsequently demolished. The railway line, which remains open for passenger traffic, separates Miles Platting from Collyhurst and Monsall. 

Between 1839 and 1844, the area was also the location of Oldham Road railway station, the original terminus for the Manchester and Leeds Railway until the line was extended to Manchester Victoria station in the latter year. The station was then converted to become a major railway goods depot by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, remaining in use until the 1960s. 

==Governance==
Miles Platting was incorporated into the City of Manchester in 1838.

==Geography==

==Landmarks==
A prominent building of Miles Platting is Victoria Mill, a huge former cotton mill that looms over the district and now houses offices and apartments. Its restoration was directed by Fr Dominic Kirkham of Corpus Christi.

==Religion==

Historically, much of the population of Miles Platting was of Irish Catholic or Italian descent, as evidenced by the large Corpus Christi Priory on Varley Street. The basilica has been served since 1889 by the Norbertine (Premonstratensian) Order, becoming an independent canonry of the order in 2004. Due to falling numbers and mounting repair and maintenance costs the basilica is now closed; the final Mass was celebrated by the Bishop of Salford on 27 April 2007. The basilica has been converted into the Usmania Banqueting Hall.

From 1880 until the slum clearances of the 1970s there was a Salvation Army corps in Cash Street.

Miles Platting is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Anglican Diocese of Manchester.

Miles Platting does also have a very small Muslim minority.

==Transport==
The majority of bus routes are operated by Stagecoach Manchester. Buses from the city centre include 74, 76, 76A. Little Gem and Stagecoach also offers the 217 service from Piccadilly Gardens to Ashton via Clayton.

<doc id="1160522" wikidata="Q6858316" url="?curid=1160522" title="Mill Glacier">
<text>Mill Glacier () is a tributary glacier, wide, flowing northwest between the Dominion Range and the Supporters Range into Beardmore Glacier, Antarctica. It was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, and named for Hugh Robert Mill, a British geographer and Antarctic historian.

==Course==

The Grosvenor Mountains, a group of widely scattered mountains and nunataks, rises above the polar plateau east of the head of Mill Glacier.
The Mill Glacier is a valley glacier that flows down from the Grosvenor Mountains past Otway Massif, then between the Dominion Range and Supporters Range before joining the Beardmore Glacier.
The head of the glacier is crossed by the Scott Icefalls.
From there it flows northwest between the Dominion Range to the west and the Otway Massif to the east.
The Mill Stream Glacier, which is fed from the south by the Burgess Glacier, joins the Mill Glacier from the east to the north of the Otway Massif.
The Vandement Glacier and the Koski Glacier enter from the Dominion Range to the west.
The Mill Glacier flows past the Supporters Range to the east to join the Beardmore Glacier from the southeast at Plunket Point.

==Airfield potential==

Over large areas the Mill Glacier has very smooth ice, free of crevasses.
Just upstream of Plunket Point, where it joins the Beardmore, there is an area of smooth and level blue ice over long in a NNW-SSE direction that is suitable for an airfield.
The ice thickness seems to be about .
The runway faces directly into the wind.
It appears to be a useful alternative to Mount Howe in an emergency.
During the Shackleton Glacier Project, 1995-1996, Lockheed LC-130 aircraft placed fuel caches on the Mill Glacier.

==Tributaries==
===Scott Icefalls===
Extensive icefalls near the head of Mill Glacier, between Otway Massif and the south part of Dominion Range. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961-62) for Captain Robert Falcon Scott.

===Mill Stream Glacier===
A tributary glacier, about wide, flowing west between Supporters Range and Otway Massif to enter Mill Glacier. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961-62) in association with Mill Glacier.

===Burgess Glacier===
A glacier, long, flowing northwest through Otway Massif to enter Mill Stream Glacier. 
Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Robert W. Burgess, United States Antarctic Program (USARP) ionospheric physicist at South Pole Station in 1963.

===Vandement Glacier===
An east-flowing glacier, long, draining the east-central portion of the Dominion Range icecap. 
The glacier lies close south of Koski Glacier, whose flow it parallels, and terminates northwest of Safety Spur. 
Named by US-ACAN for Charles H. Vandament, USARP ionospheric physicist at South Pole Station in 1962.

===Koski Glacier===
An east-flowing glacier, long, draining the east-central portion of the Dominion Range icecap. 
The glacier lies close north of Vandament Glacier, whose flow it parallels, and terminates at Mill Glacier just southeast of Browns Butte. 
Named by US-ACAN for Raymond J. Koski, USARP engineer on several traverses originating at the South Pole Station 1962-63, 1963–64 and 1964–65.

<text>The International Gandhi Peace Prize, named after Mahatma Gandhi, is awarded annually by the Government of India.

As a tribute to the ideals espoused by Gandhi, the Government of India launched the International Gandhi Peace Prize in 1995 on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Mohandas Gandhi. This is an annual award given to individuals and institutions for their contributions towards social, economic and political transformation through non-violence and other Gandhian methods. The award carries in cash, convertible in any currency in the world, a plaque and a citation. It is open to all persons regardless of nationality, race, creed or gender.

A jury consisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of India, Speaker of the Lok Sabha and two other eminent person appointed every three years eligible for reappointment decides the awardee each year.

Ordinarily, only proposals coming from competent persons invited to nominate are considered. However, a proposal is not taken as invalid for consideration by the jury merely on the ground of not having emanated from competent persons. If it is considered that none of the proposals merit recognition, the jury is free to withhold the award for that year; the award was withheld in the years from 2006 to 2012 inclusive. Only achievements within 10 years immediately preceding the nomination are considered for the award; an older work may, however, be considered if its significance has not become apparent until recently. A written work, to be eligible for consideration, should have been published.

<text>The Supporters Range () is a rugged range in the Queen Maud Mountains of Antarctica.
It is long, bordering the eastern side of Mill Glacier, from Keltie Glacier in the north to Mill Stream Glacier in the south.
So named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1961–62) because several peaks of the range are named after supporters of Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s British Antarctic Expedition (1907–09).

==Location==
The northern point of the range lies between Keltie Glacier, flowing from the east, and Mill Glacier flowing from the south and converging with Beardmore Glacier.
Ranfurly Point is its northernmost point. Laird Glacier flows from the range in Keltie Glacier, and Snakeskin Glacier flows along the northeast side of the range into Keltie Glacier.
Other features in the north include Scully Terrace, Mount Kinsey and Mount Westminster.
Features further south include Mount Iveagh, Mount Judd, Mount White and Mount Henry Lucy.
The Jensen Glacier flows along the southeast of the range, separated from the Snakeskin Glacier by the Lhasa Nunatak.

==Features==
Features, from north to south, include:

===Ranfurly Point===
A low rocky point marking the convergence of the Beardmore and Keltie Glaciers, at the northern extremity of Supporters Range.
Named by D.B. Rainey, Cartographic Branch of the Department of Lands and Survey, New Zealand, for Lord Ranfurly, Governor of New Zealand, 1897-1904.

===Scully Terrace===
A bold, flat-topped terrace which is triangular in plan and borders the northwest part of Supporters Range between Ranfurly Point and Mount Kinsey, on the east side of upper Beardmore Glacier. 
Named in 1986 by United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after R. Tucker Scully, Director, Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, United States Department of State, with responsibility for policy and negotiations relative to Antarctic resources, conservation, and the inspection of foreign stations under the Antarctic Treaty.

===Mount Kinsey ===
A mountain, high, at the east edge of Beardmore Glacier, standing southwest of Ranfurly Point.
Named by the British Antarctic Expedition 1907-09 for J.J. Kinsey of Christchurch, who conducted the affairs of the expedition in New Zealand.

A broad mountain in the Supporters Range, overlooking the east side of Mill Glacier northwest of Mount White. 
Discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition 1907-09 and named for Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, who helped finance the expedition.

===Mount Judd===
A prominent bare rock mountain, over high, surmounting the ridge running north from Mount White.
Named by US-ACAN for Robert C. Judd, USARP meteorologist at South Pole Station, winter 1964, and Hallett Station, 1964-65 summer season.

===Mount White===
A massive mountain, high, standing north-northwest of Mount Henry Lucy and forming the highest elevation in the Supporters Range. 
Discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition 1907-09 and named for the Secretary of the expedition.

===Mount Henry Lucy===
A prominent peak, high, standing south-southeast of Mount White at the south end of Supporters Range.

<doc id="1160527" wikidata="Q1575957" url="?curid=1160527" title="NKVD Order No. 00447">
<text>NKVD Order No. 00447 of July 30, 1937 () was signed by Nikolai Yezhov and approved by the Politburo during the Great Purge.

To execute this order, numerous NKVD troikas were created on republican and various regional levels (krai and oblast). Investigation was to be performed by operative groups &quot;in a speedy and simplified way&quot; and the results were to be delivered to troikas for trials.

The chairman of a troika was the chief of the corresponding territorial subdivision of NKVD (People&#x27;s Commissar of a republican NKVD, etc.). Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; if not, he or she was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the Communist Party secretary of the corresponding regional level. The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order No. 00447.

Protocols of a troika session were passed to the corresponding operative group for executions of sentences. Times and places of executions of death sentences were ordered to be held in secret.

That same order instructed to classify kulaks and other &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; into two categories: the First category (Category I) of repressed was subject to death by shooting, the Second category (Category II) was to be sent to GULAG correctional-labor camps. The order also set upper limits per territory and category of social classes (proletariat, peasant, kulak, bourgeois, others).

For example, the Byelorussian SSR was estimated to have 2,000 (Cat. I) &amp; 10,000 (Cat. II), a total of 12,000 anti-Soviet social elements. It was specifically stressed that limits were estimates and could not be exceeded without personal approval of Yezhov. In practice this approval was easy to obtain, and eventually these initial limits were exceeded by orders of magnitude.

One instance on July 23, 1938, the Omsk NKVD chief named Gorbach requested an increased limit of thousands of more executions, since his men had already fulfilled their plan. The request was approved by Stalin personally, who promoted Gorbach to a larger district. By the autumn of 1937, the pressure to achieve arrests was so great that the NKVD interrogators began picking out names from the telephone directory or preselecting married men with children who, as every agent knew, were the quickest to confess. Within 1939, the system of repression was bursting at the seams—one tenth of the population might be arrested, but not half.

After this Order, the terms First/Second Category became standard abbreviations in NKVD documentation for &quot;the highest measure of punishment&quot; and &quot;placing into corrective labor camps&quot;, respectively.

The article III the Order of Conducting the Operation instructed to start the action for securing the anti-Soviet social elements on August 5, 1937, and finish it in four-month term.

The implementation was swift. By August 15, 1937, 101,000 were arrested and 14,000 convicted. By the end of 1938, the NKVD had executed 386,798 Soviet citizens to fulfil order 00447.

<doc id="1160530" wikidata="Q344152" url="?curid=1160530" title="Nobby Stiles">
<text>Norbert Peter Stiles (18 May 194230 October 2020) was an English footballer and manager. He played for England for five years, winning 28 caps and scoring one goal. He played every minute of England&#x27;s victorious 1966 FIFA World Cup campaign. In the semi-final of that tournament against Portugal, he was given the job of marking the prolific Eusébio. His tough performance resulted in Eusébio being practically nullified for the entire game. Stiles also played in the final, which England won 4–2 against West Germany. His post-match dance on the Wembley pitch, holding the World Cup trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other, was widely broadcast.

Stiles spent the majority of his club career for Manchester United, spending eleven years at Old Trafford, where he became renowned for his tough tackling and ball-winning qualities. Jonathan Wilson, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013, labelled Stiles as a type of holding midfielder he described as a &quot;destroyer&quot;, a player who is primarily tasked with running, winning back possession, and distributing the ball to other players. 

With the Red Devils, he won two League titles and one European Cup. Stiles is one of only three Englishmen, alongside Bobby Charlton and Ian Callaghan, to have won both the World Cup and European Cup.

Stiles also had short spells with Middlesbrough and Preston North End.

==Early life==
Stiles grew up in Collyhurst, a working-class district of North Manchester, attending the local St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic (Primary) School. He was born in the cellar of the family home during an air raid, the son of Charlie, a manager of an undertakers&#x27; parlour in a family business, and Kitty, who supplemented the family income working as a machinist. He was of Irish descent.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Stiles supported Manchester United and his talent was swiftly recognised when he played for England Schoolboys at the age of 15. He achieved a childhood ambition when, in the same year, the club he supported gave him an apprenticeship in September 1959.

Stiles was an unlikely-looking footballer in many ways – he was short, at a time when teenagers were being rejected by clubs purely because of their lack of height; he also had several teeth missing and wore dentures, the removal of which prior to matches gave him a gap-toothed expression which had the potential to scare. He became significantly bald at a young age and sported a dramatic comb-over. He was also severely short-sighted, and needed strong contact lenses when playing, and wore thick spectacles off the field.

Nevertheless, Manchester United manager Matt Busby saw something in the tenacious youngster. Stiles was given his debut as a full back in October 1960 against Bolton Wanderers. Stiles&#x27;s simple passing game and fearless ball-winning skills saw his swift conversion into a &quot;holding&quot; midfield player of a type now a feature of all top teams but still a rarity at a time when forward lines consisted of five players and the midfield was restricted to covering half-backs. His ability to gain and retain possession also allowed his teammates, such as Bobby Charlton and, later, George Best, to utilise more space on the field. Stiles&#x27;s defensive skills were also utilised by United managers to great effect throughout his successful career.

That said, Busby was not afraid to sacrifice Stiles when required and when United beat Leicester City 3–1 in the 1963 FA Cup final, Stiles was not picked for the game. He began to make more frequent appearances in the seasons ahead, however, and won the First Division title in 1965.

In 1967, Stiles won his second League championship medal with Manchester United, but greater club honours were to come. United reached the European Cup final, which was to be staged at Wembley, and Stiles&#x27;s old nemesis Eusébio was again someone he had to deal with as part of a fearsome attacking potential posed by opponents Benfica. Stiles played well without keeping Eusébio wholly quiet, and with the score at 1–1 and just a few minutes left, the Portuguese legend got away from the United defence with just goalkeeper Alex Stepney to beat, yet only managed to slam the ball straight into Stepney&#x27;s midriff. United won 4–1 and became the first English club to lift Europe&#x27;s main trophy. 

===Later career===
After 395 matches and 19 goals, Manchester United sold Stiles in 1971 to Middlesbrough for £20,000. Two years later, he became a player-coach at Preston North End when Bobby Charlton was manager.

==International career==
===1966 FIFA World Cup===
With England hosting the World Cup in 1966, manager Alf Ramsey had no competitive qualifying campaign to prepare, and therefore he spent the prior two years meticulously assessing players in friendly matches and British Home Championship games. With Bobby Charlton the only certainty for his World Cup midfield, he needed to create a trio of players to complement the Manchester United attacker and among those was the requirement for a &quot;spoiler&quot;. Stiles was tested out for this role in a 2–2 draw against Scotland at Wembley on 10 April 1965. He kept his place for eight of the next nine internationals, scoring the only goal in a Wembley win against West Germany along the way, and by the time Ramsey confirmed his 22, it was thought likely that he would be in England&#x27;s starting team for the World Cup.

Stiles won his 15th cap as England kicked off the competition with a goalless draw against Uruguay and maintained his place as the uncompromising hardman playing ahead of the back four and making sure there was space and time for the likes of Charlton ahead of him. With Stiles not missing a minute, England progressed through the group with wins over Mexico and France and then scraped past a violent Argentina side in the last eight. In the France game, Stiles seriously injured their midfielder Jacques Simon with a late tackle and there were calls from the media and FA for Stiles to be dropped. Ramsey publicly defended Stiles, being sure that the tackle was mistimed rather than malicious.

In the semi-final, Stiles performed an effective man-marking job on the Portuguese playmaker, and prolific goalscorer Eusébio, to the extent that the immensely skilled player was essentially nullified for the whole match, which England won 2–1. His tactics, despite the criticism they provoked from some, were effective; Eusébio&#x27;s only major contribution was a late penalty, in a match where both sides were considered to have played attractive football in a good spirit with few fouls, and England progressed to the final. In the dressing room afterwards, Ramsey praised Stiles&#x27;s individual performance, a rare accolade.

Stiles, winning his 20th cap, had no man-marking brief against West Germany but played a strong, tough match as England saw a 2–1 lead levelled with the last kick of the game before Geoff Hurst completed a hat-trick to win the competition in extra time. At the final whistle, Stiles did a spontaneous jig with the Jules Rimet Trophy in his hand while holding his false teeth in the other. Thirty years later this moment would be referred to by Frank Skinner and David Baddiel in the lyrics to &quot;Three Lions&quot;, the England theme song written with the Lightning Seeds for Euro 96: in the 1996 version, a list of English football memories ends with &quot;...Nobby dancing&quot;, and in the 1998 version, in a reference to the World Cup finals taking place in France, the middle section consists of the line: &quot;We can dance Nobby&#x27;s dance, we can dance it in France&quot;.

===UEFA Euro 1968 and 1970 FIFA World Cup===
Stiles played in the next four internationals, but was deemed to have performed poorly as England lost to Scotland at Wembley in 1967 and was dropped by Ramsey. Stiles was selected for the England squad which contested the 1968 European Championships, but the holding role in midfield had been taken by Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Alan Mullery. England went out to Yugoslavia in the semi-finals, during which Mullery became the first ever England player to be sent off. Stiles was recalled for the otherwise meaningless third place play-off game against the Soviet Union, but it was clear that despite his misdemeanour, Mullery was now Ramsey&#x27;s first choice.

Stiles played just once for England in 1969 and twice in 1970. He was selected by Ramsey for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, but only as Mullery&#x27;s understudy, and not only did he not get a kick during the competition as England surrendered the title in the quarter-final, he never played for his country again. He ended with 28 caps – ultimately the least capped member of the 1966 XI – and one goal.

==Managerial and post-playing career==
In August 1975, Stiles was appointed as caretaker manager of Preston when Bobby Charlton resigned in protest at the transfer of defender John Bird to Newcastle United, but he resigned a week later in support of his former Manchester United teammate. Stiles returned to Preston to serve as manager from 22 July 1977 to 1 June 1981.

Stiles joined the exodus of ageing and semi-retired European players to the NASL in 1981, to become coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps, spending three years at the Canadian club.

On 29 September 1985, Stiles took over as manager of West Bromwich Albion; however, he was sacked the following February after the side managed only three wins under his leadership, and this was his final stab at management. He later revealed his struggle with depression while in the job, finding it tough to cope with working in the Midlands and the daily commute from Manchester where his family lived.

Between 1989 and 1993 he worked for Manchester United as their youth team coach, developing the considerable skills of teenage prodigies such as David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, and Paul Scholes. Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil, also came through at this time.

In 2000, Stiles was awarded an MBE after a campaign by sections of the media who highlighted that five of the 1966 team had never been officially decorated for their achievements. Stiles duly joined Alan Ball, Roger Hunt, Ray Wilson and George Cohen in collecting his award.

==Personal life==
Stiles married Kay Giles in June 1963. His wife was a sister of Johnny Giles and they were introduced to each other around the time they were teammates at Manchester United. They lived in Manchester and had three children. Stiles&#x27; son John was also a footballer, playing for Shamrock Rovers in Dublin and Leeds United in the 1980s.

Stiles was a devout Catholic throughout his life, and even tried to attend mass on the day of the World Cup final. In 1968, Stiles released his first autobiography, &quot;Soccer My Battlefield&quot;; his second, &quot;After the Ball&quot;, followed in 2003. In 2007, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.

Stiles&#x27;s FIFA World Cup medal and a European Cup medal were bought by Manchester United for more than £200,000 at an auction on 27 October 2010. The World Cup medal, which Stiles won in the 1966 final against West Germany, sold for £160,000. His European Cup medal, which he won with Manchester United in 1968, was also sold, reaching more than £49,000. Stiles sold the medals so that his family could benefit from the proceeds.

A teenage Stiles, then a Manchester United apprentice, was portrayed by actor Kyle Ward in a 2011 BBC TV drama, &quot;United&quot;, which was centred around the Munich air disaster in 1958, in which eight of United&#x27;s senior players died.

On 24 November 2013, it was announced that Stiles was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and in 2016, it was announced that he was suffering from advanced dementia. He was too ill to attend a celebration dinner to mark the 50th anniversary of England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup win. In November 2017, a BBC documentary on the subject of brain injuries amongst retired footballers presented by former England striker Alan Shearer included an interview with Stiles&#x27; son.

Stiles died on 30 October 2020 at Manor Hay Care Centre in Manchester, aged 78, after suffering with prostate cancer and dementia as a result of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from the repeated heading of footballs. Stiles&#x27;s brain was donated to the FIELD study conducted by Dr Willie Stewart into the link between dementia and a career in professional football. Stiles was one of five England players from the 1966 World Cup final who died from or suffered from dementia.

<text>Ieng Sary (; born Kim Trang; 24 October 1925 – 14 March 2013) was the co-founder and senior member of the Khmer Rouge and one of the main architects of the Cambodian genocide. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kampuchea led by Pol Pot and served in the 1975–79 government of Democratic Kampuchea as foreign minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as &quot;Brother Number Three&quot;, as he was third in command after Pol Pot and Nuon Chea. His wife, Ieng Thirith (née Khieu), served in the Khmer Rouge government as social affairs minister. Ieng Sary was arrested in 2007 and was charged with crimes against humanity but died of heart failure before the case against him could be brought to a verdict.

==Early years==
Sary was born in Nhan Hoa village, which is located in the subdistrict of Luong Hoa (known as Loeung Va in Khmer), Châu Thành District, Trà Vinh Province, southern Vietnam in 1925. His father, Kim Riem was a Khmer Krom while his mother Tran Thi Loi was both Chinese and Vietnamese mix as confirmed by the Cambodian Tribunal who moved back to Vietnam with her parents when she was a little girl. Sary changed his name from the Vietnamese Kim Trang when he joined the Khmer Rouge. He was the brother-in-law by marriage of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot (real name: Saloth Sar). Sary and Saloth Sar studied at Phnom Penh&#x27;s Lycée Sisowath where their future wives, the sisters Khieu Thirith and Khieu Ponnary also studied. Before leaving Cambodia to study in Paris, Sary was engaged to Khieu Thirith.

Sary and Saloth Sar also studied together in Paris. Whilst there, Sary rented an apartment in the Latin Quarter, a hotbed of student radicalism. He and Saloth Sar met with French communist intellectuals, and formed their own cell of Cambodian communists.

Sary and Khieu Thirith married in the town hall of Paris&#x27; 15th arrondissement in the winter of 1951. Thirith took her husband&#x27;s name, becoming Ieng Thirith.

==Mid-life==
After returning to Cambodia, he was inducted into the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Kampuchea in September 1960.

After the fall of the Khmer Republic on 17 April 1975, Sary made personal appeals to expatriates to help rebuild Cambodia. However, when they returned to Cambodia, they were arrested on arrival, and thrown into brutal detention centers. He took the nickname &quot;Brother number 3&quot; and, as head of diplomacy, he would be the only dignitary not to cultivate his secret identity.

He welcomed foreign visitors and was also responsible for purges and arrests in the government&#x27;s ministries. At the end of 1977, before the United Nations, he rejected accusations from Cambodian refugees who wanted to open a discussion with the Khmer Rouge government. Together with Pol Pot, Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in-absentia by the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Tribunal after the Democratic Khmer regime of Khmer Rouge was overthrown by Vietnam in 1979.

King Norodom Sihanouk officially pardoned Ieng Sary in 1996 after his defection from Pol Pot. He was the founder of the Democratic National Union Movement, a split from the Cambodian National Unity Party.

==Arrest and trial==

Ieng Sary, reportedly living in &quot;an opulent Phnom Penh villa surrounded by security guards and barbed wire&quot; was arrested on 12 November 2007 in Phnom Penh on an arrest warrant from the Cambodia Tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was also arrested for crimes against humanity.

On 16 December 2009, the tribunal officially charged him with genocide for his involvement with the subjugation and murder of Vietnamese and Muslim minorities in Cambodia.

==Death==
Sary died in Phnom Penh on 14 March 2013 at the age of 87, before the case against him could be brought to a verdict. He had heart problems for years as well as other ailments. He was taken from his holding cell at the special tribunal to a hospital on 4 March 2013 for what his lawyers said were gastrointestinal problems. Sary&#x27;s body was transported to his home in Banteay Meanchey province. The body lay for seven days before being cremated. At the time of his death, Sary was on trial for his involvement in the Khmer Rouge. Elisabeth Simonneau Fort, a lawyer for the victims, said &quot;For the victims, this death narrows the scope of the trial and limits their search for truth and justice&quot;.

<text>The Hughes Range () is a high massive north–south trending mountain range in Antarctica, surmounted by six prominent summits, of which Mount Kaplan at is the highest. The range is located east of Canyon Glacier in the Queen Maud Mountains and extends from the confluence of Brandau Glacier and Keltie Glacier in the south, to the Giovinco Ice Piedmont in the north.

==Discovery and naming==
The Hughes Range was discovered and photographed by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd on the baselaying flight of November 18, 1929.
It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) on the recommendation of Byrd for Charles Evans Hughes, U.S. secretary of state, U.S. chief justice, and adviser/counselor of Byrd.

==Location==
The Hughes Range runs southwest–northeast to the Giovinco Ice Piedmont on the Ross Ice Shelf.
It is separated from the Commonwealth Range and the Separation Range to the west by the Keltie Glacier, Pain Névé and Canyon Glacier. The Brandau Glacier and Muck Glacier define the southern boundary. The Barton Mountains and Bush Mountains are to their south.
The Shanklin Glacier and the Ramsey Glacier define the east side of the range.

Features of the Hughes Range, from south to north, include Ford Spur, Haynes Table, Campbell Cliffs and Mount Odishaw to the south of Pain Névé. Above Pain Névé are Mount Kaplan, Mount Wexler and Mount Weterman.
To the east, Mount Valinski is south of the Millington Glacier, a tributary of the Ramsey Glacier.
Further north are Mount Bronk, Mount Cartwright, Mount Brennan and Mount Reinhardt at the mouth of the Good Glacier. 
Den Hartog and Woodall Peak are on the promontary between Good Glacier and Ramsey Glacier.
Husky Heights, Sullivan Ridge and Four Ramps lie to the southeast of the range.

<text>Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where &quot;Corydoras&quot; is not present. &quot;Corydoras&quot; species are distributed in South America where they can be found from the east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina.

Species assigned to &quot;Corydoras&quot; display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. &quot;Corydoras&quot; are small fish, ranging from in SL., and are protected from predators by their body armor and by their sharp, typically venomous spines.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Corydoras&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;kory&quot; (helmet) and &quot;doras&quot; (skin). &quot;Corydoras&quot; is by far the largest genus of Neotropical fishes with more than 160 species. It is the sole genus in the tribe Corydoradini. &quot;C. difluviatilis&quot; is recognized as the basalmost species of Corydoradini, exhibiting several plesiomorphic features compared to the other species of &quot;Corydoras&quot;. The type species for this genus is &quot;Corydoras geoffroy&quot;. Several hundred species are not yet classified, but kept by aquarists. These species are given &#x27;C-numbers&#x27;, originally devised by Hans-Georg Evers for the German fishkeeping magazine &quot;DATZ&quot; in 1993. , 158 C-numbers had been assigned, of which 32 had been assigned appropriate scientific names.

The species &quot;C. barbatus&quot;, &quot;C. macropterus&quot; and &quot;C. prionotos&quot; have been reclassified into the genus &quot;Scleromystax&quot;. &quot;Brochis&quot; had been differentiated from &quot;Corydoras&quot; due to the higher number of dorsal fin rays; however, &quot;Brochis&quot; has recently been suggested to be a synonym of &quot;Corydoras&quot;. This is contested and has not been universally accepted. The sixray corydoras belongs in &quot;Aspidoras&quot;.

===&quot;Brochis&quot;===
Brochis is a formerly recognized genus of catfish. Between one and three fish of the Callichthyidae in the Siluriformes order are referred to as &quot;Brochis&quot;, however following recent classification these three species have been grouped in the genus &quot;Corydoras&quot;. The genus is considered defunct by most scientific authorities, or as a junior synonym or subgenus of &quot;Corydoras&quot;. Consequently, it is an example of Obsolete taxa
Despite being considered defunct, there are several morphological differences that fish formerly classified in the genus &quot;Brochis&quot; have. These include a noticeably larger body, a more lyre-like tail and most decisively, the extended dorsal fins that have more rays than those of &quot;Corydoras&quot; &quot;Corydoras&quot; have 7–10 rays on their dorsal fins, while Brochis have 10–18. &quot;Brochis&quot; are very large for their family, as all three species can exceed in length.
In the &quot;Brochis&quot; stable, &quot;Corydoras splendens&quot; is the largest. It is also the largest &quot;Corydoras&quot; attaining a maximum size of 9.9 centimetres and 40 grams.

==Ecology==
&quot;Corydoras&quot; are generally found in smaller-sized streams, along the margins of larger rivers, in marshes, and in ponds. They are native to slow-moving and almost still (but seldom stagnant) streams and small rivers of South America, where the water is shallow and very murky. Most species are bottom-dwellers, foraging in sand, gravel or detritus. The banks and sides of the streams are covered with a dense growth of plants and this is where the Corydoras are found. They inhabit a wide variety of water types but tend toward soft, neutral to slightly acidic or slightly alkaline pH and 5–10 degrees of hardness. They can tolerate only a small amount of salt (some species tolerate none at all) and do not inhabit environments with tidal influences. They are often seen in shoals. Most species prefer being in groups and many species are found in schools or aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of individuals, usually of a single species, but occasionally with other species mixed in. Unlike most catfishes, which are nocturnal, these species are nocturnal while also being active during the daytime. &quot;Corydoras&quot; are capable of breathing both water and air, often swimming to the surface to quickly ingest air before re-submerging. The frequency of this air breathing behavior increases when Corydoras are exposed to water with low oxygen availability, allowing them to tolerate periods of aquatic hypoxia.

Their main food is bottom-dwelling insects and insect larvae and various worms, as well as some vegetable matter. Although no Corydoras are piscivorous, they will eat flesh from dead fishes. Their feeding method is to search the bottom with their sensory barbels and suck up food items with their mouth, often burying their snout up to their eyes.

In several species of &quot;Corydoras&quot;, it has been observed that the fishes, after initial evasive reaction to threat, lie still; this is suggested to be a form of cryptic behavior. However, it is also argued that most species do not have cryptic coloration nor freezing behavior and continue to exist, likely due to their armor and venom. A few species of &quot;Otocinclus&quot;: (&quot;O. affinis&quot;, &quot;O. flexilis&quot;, &quot;O. mimulus&quot; and &quot;O. xakriaba&quot;) are considered to be Batesian mimics of certain &quot;Corydoras&quot; species (&quot;C. diphyes&quot;, &quot;C. garbei&quot;, &quot;C. nattereri&quot; and &quot;C. paleatus&quot;, respectively). These species have bony plates of armor and strong, frequently venomous spines as defenses, making them less palatable; by mimicking these species in size and coloration, &quot;Otocinclus&quot; avoid predation.

A unique form of insemination has been described in &quot;Corydoras aeneus&quot;. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male&#x27;s genital opening, creating the well-known &quot;T-position&quot; many &quot;Corydoras&quot; exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just &quot;C. aeneus&quot;, it is likely that this behavior is common in the genus.

==In the aquarium==
The genus is well known among aquarists for its many ornamental species. &quot;Corydoras&quot; are quite placid and well suited to tropical freshwater community aquariums, as they get along well with most other species and are not aggressive. They are recommended to be kept in shoals of four to six or more. Corydoras are mostly bottom feeders, so they should be offered sinking pellets as well as supplements of live and frozen foods. If flake foods are used, care should be taken to prevent all food from being eaten by faster moving fish at the higher levels of the tank.

Most Corydoras prefer water with a slightly basic pH between 7 and 8, and temperatures between They do not do well in fish tanks with high nitrate levels. This ion leads to the infection of the barbels, which will shorten and become useless. The barbels may also be affected by constant contact with a sharp substrate. Contrary to popular belief, these fish can be kept in a tank with gravel without affecting their barbels, as long as there are no sharp edges on the gravel, although they do prefer sand substrate. They are more likely to thrive if there is an open area of substrate on the bottom of the tank where they can obtain submerged food. It is a myth that salt cannot be used on this species of fish as a means of parasite medication. Salt can be added to the water of the Corydoras catfish in order to rid the fish of ich. These fish are fairly easy to keep, being peaceful, hardy, active and entertaining. Occasionally they will dart to the surface, sticking their snout above the water for an instant to take a breath of air. This behavior is perfectly normal and is not an indication that anything is wrong with the fish. However, if this is done in excess, it can indicate poor water conditions.

Where investigated, &quot;Corydoras sp.&quot; have been shown to be diurnal and crepuscular rather than nocturnal and activity can even peak at twilight. &quot;Corydoras&quot; are a very popular choice for a community aquarium and are widely kept throughout the world. Between the years of 2006 and 2015, over 8,600,000 &quot;Corydoras&quot; were exported from the state of Amazonas, accounting for roughly 6.06% of the state&#x27;s ornamental fish exports during this time. Their longevity in the aquarium is noteworthy; &quot;C. aeneus&quot; is said to have lived 27 years in captivity and 20 years is not uncommon.

<text>Bath Beach is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, located at the southwestern edge of the borough on Gravesend Bay. The neighborhood borders Bensonhurst and New Utrecht to the northeast across 86th Street; Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course to the northwest across 14th Avenue; and Gravesend to the east across Stillwell Avenue.

==History==
Bath Beach held one of Brooklyn&#x27;s earliest African-American settlements. Freed slaves were given a parcel of land to settle in the mid-nineteenth century. The church that was once located in the heart of that community, Mount Zion Baptist, left the neighborhood and relocated to Bedford-Stuyvesant.

The term &quot;Bath Beach&quot; once described the beach resort specifically as part of the community of Bath, New York. Bath and Bath Beach are now more or less synonymous. The population of Bath Beach received a boost at the end of 1863 when steam dummy railroad service connected the community to the City of Brooklyn horsecar system terminal at 25th Street and 5th Avenue in Sunset Park. Bath Beach, named for the English spa, Bath, Somerset, was developed as a recreational seaside retreat for affluent families. It was part of the original Brooklyn town of New Utrecht. Although Coney Island was nearby, Bath Beach also had its own amusement park.

Despite its name, the neighborhood no longer has an actual beach. The beach was paved over during the mid-twentieth century to create the Shore Parkway. On the northwestern half, a promenade was constructed to allow residents access to a sea wall. The southwestern half, filled in with land excavated from the construction of the Shore (Belt) Parkway in the early 1940s, extended Bensonhurst Park, between 21st Avenue and Bay Parkway from Cropsey Avenue with ballfields and, later, the Ceasar&#x27;s Bay shopping center.

==Demographics==
Bath Beach is primarily a working-class community of semi-attached houses and small apartment houses. In the early 1900s many Italian immigrants settled in Brooklyn, including the neighborhoods of Bath Beach, Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, and Gravesend, resulting in the establishment and growth of a substantial Italian American community. Since the 1990s, many Asian, West Asian, Eastern European, Central American, and Middle Eastern immigrants have settled in Bath Beach and surrounding neighborhoods, contributing to a rise in ethnic diversity in Brooklyn. The neighborhood contains a variety of small mom-and-pop businesses intermixed with chain stores, most of which are located at the Bay Shopping Center at the terminus of Bay Parkway, as well as on 86th Street and Bath Ave.

Based on data from the 2020 United States Census, the population of Bath Beach was 33,070. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 41% (13,543) Asian American, 40% (13,227) White, 1.3% (443) African American 0.6% (187) from other races, and 2.9% (975) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.2% (4,695) of the population.

==Street grid==
Streets of the neighborhood have a unique nomenclature. Four two-way thoroughfares traverse the neighborhood, running southeast/northwest, parallel to Shore Parkway: these are Cropsey Avenue, Bath Avenue, Benson Avenue, and 86th Street. Another, Harway Avenue, runs from Stillwell only as far as 24th Avenue. The one-way northeast/southwest cross-streets are numbered, with the word &quot;Bay&quot; attached (to distinguish them from other numbering systems elsewhere in the borough), from Bay 7th Street in the northwest through Bay 54th Street in the southeast. Every third &quot;Bay&quot; numbered street is replaced with a two-way numbered avenue, from 14th Avenue in the northwest to 28th Avenue in the southeast (except for what would be 22nd Avenue, which is called Bay Parkway). These avenues (as well as 86th Street) are part of the larger grid of avenues and streets encompassing other neighborhoods to the north and west, in the former Towns of Gravesend, New Utrecht, and Brooklyn. Belt Parkway runs on the shorefront north of Bay Parkway and is close to the shorefront south of Bay Parkway.

==Parks==
Parks in Bath Beach include Bensonhurst Park located at the intersection of Cropsey Ave. and Bay Parkway, the Shore Parkway bike path/promenade west of the Belt Parkway, Bath Playground, Calvert Vaux Park, Scarangella Playground, and Anthony Catanzaro Square.

==Transportation==
Bath Beach is served by the of the New York City Subway system, along the BMT West End Line. Stations along the line serving the community are 18th Avenue, 20th Avenue, Bay Parkway, 25th Avenue, and Bay 50th Street. MTA Regional Bus Operations routes serving Bath Beach include the in addition to the . express routes.

==Library==
The Brooklyn Public Library&#x27;s Ulmer Park branch is located at 2602 Bath Avenue near 26th Avenue. It was founded as a subdivision of another library in 1951 before becoming a full-fledged circulation branch in 1956. The current building was opened in 1963 and was renovated in 2016.

== In popular culture ==
During the 1970s, Bath Beach&#x27;s commercial strip along 86th Street was used for scenes in the 1971 feature film &quot;The French Connection&quot;, in the opening credits to the popular television series &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, and most famously in the opening scene of the 1977 feature film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. Tony Manero, the lead character (played by John Travolta), walks along the sidewalk, admires shoes in a storefront window, buys two (stacked) slices of pizza through a pizzeria window-counter at Lenny&#x27;s Pizza, and ends up at the hardware store where he works (based on a real hardware store on Fifth Avenue in nearby Bay Ridge). The strip was used again in 2016 for the filming of Red Hot Chili Peppers - Go Robot music video. The film &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&quot; features the main character on horseback along 86th Street.

==Notable people==
Notable current and former residents of Bath Beach include:
* Vincent Favale (born 1959), entertainment industry professional and co-founder of Comedy Central

<text>The Niger Coast Protectorate was a British protectorate in the Oil Rivers area of present-day Nigeria, originally established as the Oil Rivers Protectorate in 1884 and confirmed at the Berlin Conference the following year. It was renamed on 12 May 1893, and merged with the chartered territories of the Royal Niger Company on 1 January 1900 to form the Southern Nigeria Protectorate.
This covered the eastern coast of what it today Nigeria, and in theory extended inland as far as Lokoja. It was established to better regulate and control the large trade in palm oil that was coming through both Calabar and the Niger Delta, and which had given the various rivers in the area the name of oil rivers.

<text>The Mara River is a river that begins in Narok County (Kenya) and ends in Mara Region (Tanzania). It lies across the migration path of ungulates in the Maasai Mara/Serengeti ecosystem.

==The River&#x27;s flow==
The Mara River basin covers a surface of 13,504 km2, of which approximately 65% is located in Kenya and 35% in Tanzania. From its sources in the Kenyan highlands, the river flows for about 395 km and originates from the Mau Escarpment and drains into Lake Victoria. The basin can be roughly divided into four land use and/or administrative units.

==The Mara&#x27;s regions==

The Mau Escarpment: The Mara River originates from the Napuiyapi swamp (2932 m), with the main perennial tributaries being the Amala and the Nyangores, which drain from the western Mau Escarpment. This part of the basin supports besides forests, both small-scale agriculture (less than 10 acres) and medium-size farms (often tea farms up to 40 acres).

The Kenyan Rangelands: In this area, the Amala and Nyangores rivers flow out of the Mau Escarpment and converge to form the Mara River. The river then meanders further through open savannah grasslands that is mostly governed by Maasai group ranches and used as pasture for livestock and for both small — and large-scale agriculture (more than 40 acres). The basins of four important tributaries to the Mara (the Talek, Engare, Sand and Engito rivers) are also located in this area, together with some upland areas like the Loita Hills.

The Protected areas: Eventually the river flows into the world-famous Masai Mara National Reserve, where it merges with three of the four mentioned tributaries. On the Kenyan-Tanzanian border, the river flows into the Serengeti National Park and is joined by the fourth major tributary: the Sand (or Longaianiet) River. In these wildlife parks human activity is restricted to wildlife viewing.

Downstream in Mara Region Tanzania: Just after the Mara River flows out of Ikorongo Game Reserve (which borders Serengeti National Park) it meanders sharply northwards. At the location where the river meanders into the southwestern direction again the main channel is lost in different streams, which feed the downstream Mara Wetlands. These streams and wetlands continue for about 70 kilometres downstream. In this part of the basin human and livestock densities are high and small-scale subsistence agriculture is the main land use. The Mara River basin is one of the ten drainage basins that feed into Lake Victoria, and is therefore functionally and ecologically related to the socio-economic activities in Lake Victoria and along the River Nile.

==Altitudes and ranges==

The altitudes in the basin range from 2,932 m around the sources in the Mau Escarpment to 1,134 m around Lake Victoria. The amount of precipitation varies according to these altitudes. The Mau Escarpment receives most rainfall with a mean annual rainfall between 1,000 and 1,750 mm. The transboundary middle savannah grasslands receive an average between 900 and 1,000 mm, and the Kenyan lower Loita hills and the area around Lake Victoria only about 700 and 850 mm rain per year. On top of this rainfall variability in space, the region is also known for its rainfall variability in time, which means that the different areas all receive variable amounts of rainfall over the year. The rainfall seasons are bi-modal, with the long rains starting in mid-March to June with a peak in April, while the short rains occur between September and December.
==The Mara&#x27;s effects==
The river is a vital source to grazing animals within the reserve. Although during the dry season it may often appear shallow, it may swell to up to twice its normal size after heavy rainfall. This can create rapids in the river, which may lead to shortage of food for predators that cannot cross the river to hunt.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of the [[Niger Coast Protectorate]].

The Niger Coast Protectorate was a British protectorate in the Oil Rivers area of present-day Nigeria, originally established as the Oil Rivers Protectorate in 1891 and confirmed at the Berlin Conference the following year, renamed on 12 May 1893, and merged with the chartered territories of the Royal Niger Company on 1 January 1900 to form the Southern Nigeria Protectorate.

== Oil Rivers Protectorate ==

The main post office was established at Old Calabar in November 1891; sub-offices existed at Benin, Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Warri. Initially the postage stamps of Britain were used; in July 1892 they were overprinted with &quot;BRITISH / PROTECTORATE / OIL / RIVERS&quot;. A pressing need for halfpenny values in mid-1893 resulted in a variety of surcharges on 2d and 2d stamps. While most simply read &quot;HALF / PENNY&quot;, with a horizontal bar to obliterate the old value, some were overprinted &quot;1/2 d&quot; twice, with the intent that they be bisected diagonally to produce two 1/2d stamps.

== Niger Coast Protectorate ==

A name change occurred just as new stamps were being prepared, and so the first issue of the Niger Coast Protectorate, featuring a 3/4 portrait of Queen Victoria, was inscribed &quot;OIL RIVERS&quot; but obliterated and re-engraved &quot;NIGER COAST&quot; in a way which makes it look like an overprint. Available in November 1893 in six denominations with various colors, they were superseded the following May by stamps in a new design and the correct inscription. This design continued for the remainder of the protectorate&#x27;s existence, with a change over to use the &quot;Crown &amp; CA&quot; watermark from 1897 onwards (the paper had previously been unwatermarked) and an additional three denominations.

Stamps of the Niger Coast Protectorate were superseded by those of Southern Nigeria Protectorate from January 1900

<doc id="1160574" wikidata="Q7831531" url="?curid=1160574" title="Track Warrant Control">
<text>A track warrant is a set of instructions issued to a train crew authorizing specific train movements. The system is widely used in North America. The warrant is issued by the train dispatcher and delivered to the train crew via radio. The train crew copies the instructions onto a pre-printed paper form and reads back the warrant to ensure that nothing was misunderstood.

==Operation==
Track warrants are issued granting main track use between two named points (i.e. milepost sign, station, or any fixed physical point, such as a switch). The dispatcher may also issue time constraints (known as &quot;Box 6&quot; on a standard form), although the track warrants remain in effect until cleared by a member of the receiving crew. Track warrants are sometimes used in conjunction with a block signal system to provide rear-end protection against following trains.

Track warrants usually allow a train to move in one direction only—a &quot;proceed&quot; instruction. Sometimes a train may also be given authorizing movements in either direction, called a &quot;work between&quot; instruction. However, only one train can have a section of track at one particular time if moving in the same direction. If there are two trains moving in the same direction, the leading train must give up the track before the trailing train can obtain a track warrant for that territory. For example, if Train 56 has a track warrant to proceed in the northbound direction from MP (milepost) 14 to MP 77 and there is a train following, then Train 56 must give up a portion or all of its warrant before the following train can be issued the track that Train 56 has already cleared. Many times this is accomplished by the dispatcher asking the leading train for their milepost location and then issuing a warrant up to that point to the trailing train. Continuing the previous example, if Train 56 is clear of MP 50, the dispatcher can issue a warrant to the trailing train up to MP 50, but not beyond it. Once a train has received a new track warrant or has left track warrant territory they will release the entirety of their warrant back to the dispatcher.

Maintenance of way crews receive track bulletins (usually called &quot;Form A&quot;, &quot;Form B&quot; or &quot;Form C&quot;) in order to perform track work that would otherwise be interrupted by passing trains. This is done by providing the maintenance crew with a form or protection, or allowing work to be done behind a passing train.

=== Comparison with Direct Traffic Control ===

Track Warrant Control is similar to yet distinct from the concept of Direct Traffic Control (DTC), appearing later as railroads migrated fully from older forms of train order operation. DTC was designed to facilitate the movement of trains using concepts of blocks and sidings previously used with train orders. DTC is only a mechanism to transfer movement authority and can work only within an arrangement of predefined blocks. Track warrant systems appropriate the remaining responsibility of train order systems to notify operating personnel of safety directives that include things like temporary speed restrictions, tracks out of service, etc. and combines them with the movement authority function of DTC. Furthermore, track warrants are not limited to fixed blocks and can be issued and released from almost any explicitly identified landmark along the rail line.

==Standard instructions used in track warrants==
Most track warrants in the U.S. follow a standard form as suggested by the General Code of Operating Rules, consisting of several standard instructions to mark specific notes or conditions for a warrant. These vary from temporary speed restrictions to rules regarding meeting other trains.

* Box 1. Void on a previous warrant.
* Box 2. Proceed from point to point.
* Box 3. Proceed from point to point (cont.)
* Box 4. Work between certain limits.
* Box 5. Not in effect until ____ .
* Box 6. Authority expires at ____ .
* Box 7. Not in effect until after the arrival of ____ at ____ .
* Box 8. Hold main track at last named point.
* Box 9. Do not foul limits ahead of ____ .
* Box 10. Clear main track at last named point.
* Box 11. Between ____ and ____ make all movements at restricted speed: limits occupied by train.
* Box 12. Between ____ and ____ make all movements at restricted speed: limits occupied by men or equipment.
* Box 13. Do not exceed ____ mph between _____ and ____ .
* Box 14. Do not exceed ____ mph between _____ and ____ .
* Box 15. Flag protection not required against following trains on same track.
* Box 16. Track bulletins in effect.
* Boxes 17 and 18: Other specific instructions.

Some railroad systems, such as RailAmerica, use additional boxes:

* Box 18. Joint with _____ between ____________ and _____________ .
* Box 19. Expect to find the following switch(es) lined and locked in the reverse position: _________ .
* Box 20. The following switch(es) may be left lined and locked in the reverse position: _________ .

Non-GCOR Track Warrant systems include the NORAC Form D Control System (DCS) which was later partly adopted by CSX to supplant its older DTC system.

==Use of track warrants on specific railroads==

The BNSF Railway uses track warrants on its El Paso Subdivision which runs from Belen, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas, with the dispatcher in Fort Worth, Texas. There are no electrical signals on the route. BNSF also uses TWC (Track Warrant Control) between Williams, AZ (Seligman Subdivision) to Phoenix, AZ (Phoenix Subdivision), Forsyth Subdivision between Jones Jct. (a suburb of Billings, Montana) and Hysham, Montana. Unlike the El Paso Subdivision, ABS is used. And on the Madill Subdivision between Denison, TX and Irving, TX with an ABS signal overlay on the northern ten or so miles between Denison and Sherman, TX. Track Warrant Control is also used in many other lower to medium traffic volume sections of the BNSF system, sometimes with an automatic block signal system overlay, and on the other class one railroads as well. Some smaller Class II railroads, such as the Iowa Interstate Railroad, and many Class III railroads are dispatched completely by track warrant.

Canadian railways use a similar system called &quot;Occupancy Control System&quot; (OCS), in which movements are controlled via clearances issued over the radio from the Rail Traffic Controller to the train. The system is in wide use on lines that aren&#x27;t installed with centralized traffic control (CTC).

In Australia &amp; NZ:
The New South Wales Country Regional Network (CRN) uses electronic track warrants (train orders) on 2,400km of track. Functionality includes &#x27;proximity&#x27; warnings and &#x27;out of authority&#x27; alarms to improve driver situation awareness.
The Australian Rail Track Corporation (www.artc.com.au) uses track warrants on several thousand kilemtres of single track line.

KiwiRail in New Zealand also uses track warrants; in 2008 they were required on , or 56% of KiwiRail&#x27;s tracks.

<text>The Bush Mountains is a series of rugged elevations at the heads of the Ramsey and Kosco glaciers in Antarctica.
The Bush Mountains extend from Mount Weir in the west to Anderson Heights overlooking Shackleton Glacier in the east.

==Exploration and naming==
They were photographed at a distance by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (Byrd AE) on several flights to the Queen Maud Mountains in November 1929. The mountains were further defined from aerial photographs taken by the USAS (1939–41), US Navy Operation Highjump (1946–47), and USN Operation Deep Freeze (1956–63).
The Bush Mountains were named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-SCAN) on the recommendation of Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, after James I. Bush, United States financier and patron of the Byrd AE, 1928–30.

==Location==
The Bush Mountains are at the head of the Ramsey Glacier and its tributary the Bowin Glacier.
Features, from west to east, include Fulgham Ridge, Mount Weir, McIntyre Promontory, Mount Cromie, Mount Boyd and Mount Bennett. 
The mountains terminate at Anderson Heights and Cascade Bluff to the east, at the head of Kosco Glacier and Mincey Glacier.

==Features==
Geographical features and nearby features include:

===Mount Weir===
A steep section of the polar plateau escarpment with almost all of the rock exposed facing northeast, standing just south of the base of Fulgham Ridge at the head of Ramsey Glacier. 
Discovered and photographed by United States Navy Operation Highjump on Flight 8A of Feb. 16, 1947, and named by United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Maj. Robert R. Weir, United States Marine Corps, pilot of this flight.

===Mount Cromie===
A snow-covered mountain, high, rising southeast of Mount Boyd in the Bush Mountains. 
Discovered and photographed by the United States Antarctic Service, 1939-41. 
Surveyed by A.P. Crary, leader of the United States Ross Ice Shelf Traverse Party (1957-58), and named by him for William Cromie, assistant glaciologist with the party.

===Mount Boyd===
A pyramidal mountain, high, standing west of Mount Bennett, in the Bush Mountains. 
Discovered and photographed by the United States Antarctic Service, 1939-41. 
Surveyed by A.P. Crary, leader of the United States Ross Ice Shelf Traverse Party (1957-58), and named by him for Walter Boyd, Jr., glaciologist with the party.

===Mount Bennett===
A prominent mountain, high, about east of Mount Boyd, surmounting the west part of Anderson Heights, Queen Maud Mountains. 
Discovered by the United States Antarctic Service (1939-41), and surveyed by the United States Ross Ice Shelf Traverse Party (1957-58) led by A.P. Crary. 
Named by Crary for Hugh Bennett, seismologist with the party.

===Cascade Bluff===
A low, mainly ice-covered bluff that forms the southwest wall of Mincey Glacier in the Queen Maud Mountains. 
The feature was so named by the Texas Tech-Shackleton Glacier Party, 1962-63, because water cascades over the bluff during warm periods.

<doc id="1160582" wikidata="Q5414004" url="?curid=1160582" title="Eurydice (Ruhl play)">
<text>Eurydice is a 2003 play by Sarah Ruhl which retells the myth of Orpheus from the perspective of Eurydice, his wife. The story focuses on Eurydice&#x27;s choice to return to Earth with Orpheus or to stay in the underworld with her father (a character created by Ruhl). Ruhl made several changes to the original myth&#x27;s story-line. The most noticeable of these changes was that in the myth Orpheus succumbs to his desires and looks back at Eurydice, while in Ruhl&#x27;s version Eurydice calls out to Orpheus (causing him to look back) perhaps in part because of her fear of reentering the world of the living and perhaps as a result of her desire to remain in the land of the dead with her father. Ruhl&#x27;s script has been explicitly written so as to be a playground for the designer of the sets.

The play was adapted by Ruhl for the libretto of an opera by the same name, with music composed by Matthew Aucoin, and directed by Mary Zimmerman. &quot;Eurydice&quot; premiered in Los Angeles in February 2020 and at the Metropolitan Opera on November 23, 2021. Its opening at the Met was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Productions==
The play had its world premiere at Madison Repertory Theatre, Madison, Wisconsin, in September 2003. The play next was produced at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, California, in October to November 14, 2004. Directed by Les Waters, Associate Artistic Director, the cast featured Maria Dizzia as Eurydice and Daniel Talbott as Orpheus. It next was presented at Yale Repertory Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut, in September 2006 to October 14, directed by Les Waters, with Maria Dizzia (Eurydice) and Joseph Parks (Orpheus).

The play opened Off-Broadway at Second Stage Theater, running from June 18 to August 26, 2007. Directed by Les Waters, the cast featured Maria Dizzia as Eurydice, Joseph Parks as Orpheus, and Charles Shaw Robinson as Eurydice&#x27;s Father. The play received several award nominations, including the 2008 Drama League Award, Distinguished Production of a Play, and the 2008 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Set Design of a Play, (Scott Bradley). Charles Isherwood, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it a &quot;weird and wonderful new play.&quot;

==Plot==
The play consists of three movements, divided into numerous scenes: 7 in the first movement, 20 in the second movement, and 3 in the third movement.

The play begins with Eurydice and Orpheus, two young lovers, who are about to get married. In the underworld, Eurydice&#x27;s dead father has managed to preserve his memory and his ability to read and write, and tries to send her letters. During the wedding, Eurydice goes outside to get a drink of water and she meets a man (the &quot;Nasty Interesting Man&quot;) who tells her he has a letter from her father. Eurydice decides to go to his apartment to retrieve the letter, but as she leaves his apartment after resisting the man&#x27;s attempts to seduce her, she trips and falls to her death on the stairs.

At the beginning of the second movement, there is no set change, but &quot;the movement to the underworld is marked by the entrance of stones&quot;: Little Stone, Big Stone, and Loud Stone, who serve as a chorus.

Eurydice enters the underworld through an elevator, inside which it is raining. Upon arrival, she meets her father, who tries to reteach Eurydice about her past since she has lost her memory after being dipped in the river Lethe. The Stones try unsuccessfully to stop them, because the dead are not allowed to remember their past or speak in human language. Rooms are also not allowed in the underworld, but Eurydice&#x27;s father creates one for her out of pieces of string. He gradually re-teaches her human language and her past. While the father is away at work, the lord of the underworld enters as a child riding a tricycle and attempts to seduce Eurydice, but fails.

Meanwhile, in the land of the living, Orpheus writes a letter to Eurydice, which her father delivers and reads to her. Orpheus also sends her a copy of the &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; by attaching it to a piece of string, and Eurydice&#x27;s father reads to her from &quot;King Lear&quot;. Orpheus sends another letter, and then resolves to go to the underworld himself to find her.

In the third movement, Orpheus arrives at the gates of the underworld, singing a song so powerful it makes the Stones weep. The lord of the underworld tells him that he may take Eurydice back, but only if he does not turn around to look at her. Eurydice is then faced with the decision to either stay with her father or go back with her husband. At her father&#x27;s insistence, she follows Orpheus. But as she catches up to him, she calls out his name, and he turns to look at her, causing her to die a second death. Meanwhile, her father has decided that he wants to forget everything, and dips himself in the river again. When Eurydice returns, her father is lying silent on the ground, having lost all of his language and memory forever.

As Eurydice mourns her father, the lord of the underworld returns, having grown from a child to superhuman height. He orders her to be his bride. Eurydice pens a letter to Orpheus and his next wife, then immerses herself in the river and lies down in forgetfulness. Finally, Orpheus too enters from the elevator, having truly died this time. He finds Eurydice&#x27;s letter to him, but because he has been dipped in the river, he cannot read it.

==Opera==
Ruhl adapted the play into the libretto for an opera, &quot;Eurydice&quot; by Matthew Aucoin, which premiered at the Los Angeles Opera on February 1, 2020.

<doc id="1160586" wikidata="Q155888" url="?curid=1160586" title="Periorbital dark circles">
<text>Periorbital dark circles (including dark circles of the lower eyelid) are dark blemishes around the eyes. There are many causes of this symptom, including heredity and bruising.

==Causes==
===Anatomical factors===
Bony structure and prominence of the orbicularis oculi muscle can contribute to infraorbital dark circles. Skin in the lower eyelid is very thin which accentuates subdermal features.

===Allergies, asthma, and eczema===
Any condition that causes the eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles due to rubbing or scratching the skin around them. Hay fever sufferers in particular will notice under-eye &quot;smudges&quot; during the height of the allergy season. Atopy can lead to frequent rubbing of the eyes, leading to local inflammation and increased pigmentation.

Also, dark circles from allergies are caused by superficial venous congestion in the capillaries under the eyes.

===Medications===
Any medications that cause blood vessels to dilate can cause circles under the eyes to darken. The skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increased blood flow shows through the skin.

===Cortisol deficiency===
When cortisol is deficient the pituitary compensates by producing excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), the latter resulting in dark circles under the eyes.

===Anemia===
The lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balanced diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes. It is believed that iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause dark circles as well. Iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia and this condition is a sign that not enough oxygen is getting to the body tissues.

The skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation (due to lack of iron), allowing the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible.

===Fatigue===
A lack of sleep and mental fatigue can cause paleness of the skin, allowing the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear bluer or darker.

===Age===
Dark circles are likely to become more noticeable and permanent with age. This is because as people get older, their skin loses collagen, becoming thinner and more translucent. As facial fat descends and fat volume decreases, the somewhat inflexible ligaments can result in orbital rim and facial hollowing. Photoaging has similar effects. Hemoglobin breakdown products such as hemosiderin and biliverdin can leak from the vascular contributing to pigmentation changes.

Circles may also gradually begin to appear darker in one eye than the other as a result of some habitual facial expressions, such as an uneven smile.

===Sun exposure===
Sunlight causes the skin to produce more melanin, the pigment that darkens skin.

===Periorbital hyperpigmentation===

&quot;Periorbital hyperpigmentation&quot; occurs when more melanin produced around the eyes than is usual, giving them a darker color.

==Treatment==
At one time, hydroquinone solution was often mixed in an oil-free moisturizer that acted like a skin bleach. However, the use of hydroquinone for skin whitening has been banned in European countries due to health concerns. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its approval of hydroquinone for over the counter preparations, warning that it may cause cancer or have many other detrimental effects. The use of hydroquinone skin-whitening products may be toxic, harmful, or lethal for humans.

Modern treatments include topical creams that are marketed for the condition. Various ingredients have been researched, developed and included in these creams. For example, recently, chemical compounds called alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) have been added as a beneficial ingredient to creams for dark circles. Specialist treatments including laser and intense pulsed light skin surgery can also be used. Low-level laser therapy, autologous fat transplantation and hyaluronic acid fillers are also alternative treatment options.

In addition, many skin care ingredients can help in the form of eye creams. Caffeine is a potent vasoconstrictor that has been proven to improve the look of dark circles by constricting, or tightening, the dilated vessels under eyes. Vitamin C can help brighten hyperpigmentation as well as thicken the dermal layer of skin which conceals dark circles.

<text>Prospect Park South is a small neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City, located south of Prospect Park. It is included within the Prospect Park South Historic District, which was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The historic district is bounded by Church Avenue to the north, the BMT Brighton Line () of the New York City Subway to the east, Beverley Road to the south, and between Stratford Road and Coney Island Avenue to the west.

Prospect Park South, along with other neighborhoods within Flatbush, is policed by the 70th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==

In 1899, developer Dean Alvord purchased about of farmland in order to create Prospect Park South, a community of substantial homes, a &quot;rural park within the limitations of the conventional city block and city street.&quot; Alvord characterized the development as &quot;rus in urbe&quot;, the country in the city. The location was selected to take advantage of the train service on the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). The line, now known as the BMT Brighton Line, offered express and local train service that remains to this day. The trains emerged at Fulton Street as an elevated line and continued across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan.

Once he had purchased the land, Alvord laid out all the necessary utilities and marked the entrance of most streets with brick piers with cast concrete plaques bearing the bas-relief inscription &quot;PPS&quot;. He also hired John Aitkin, a Scottish landscape gardener, to supervise the plantings for the lawns and the Flatbush Malls, with meticulous attention given to details. Trees, for instance, were not planted only along the curb line, but also at the building line as well, to give the streets greater breadth of vision, to block out adjoining houses, and provide the illusion that each house was the only one on the block. Both Norway maples and Carolina poplars were used: the poplars for immediate shade, and the slower-growing maples for long-term shade. Alvord did all this before selling a single plot.

Alvord also hired architect John J. Petit and a staff to design the houses in the development, although clients could also provide their own architect if they preferred to. Petit ended up designing many of the houses in the development, in a wide variety of styles, including Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival and Queen Anne. The houses in Prospect Park South were required to be substantial, freestanding homes exceeding and costing over US$5,000. Several other restrictions were also placed upon builders wishing to develop the lots.

Alvord wanted to create an environment that attracted the Protestant, wealthy elite while excluding the immigrant population moving into Brooklyn at the time. In his original prospectus, Alvord wrote:

In fixing upon a location for a home, it is pleasant to live where children, in going to and fro, are not subject to the annoyance of contact with the undesirable elements of society. The Flatbush Avenue trolley line penetrates no slum sections and is patronized almost exclusively by people of intelligence and good breeding.

While not the first attempt at suburban development in the area, Alvord&#x27;s vision excited the interest of the wealthy of Brooklyn Heights and Manhattan residents. Ultimately, Alvord&#x27;s restrictions not only created an exciting new design but a standard to become a blueprint for the modern suburb. Enthusiasm for his design in following years would see South Midwood, Fiske Terrace, Ditmas Park, the Beverley Squares, and many more developments spring up in the surrounding area to accommodate the demand, together forming what is now known as Victorian Flatbush.

In 1972, New York&#x27;s Albanian community established a mosque at 1325 Albemarle Road.

Prospect Park South was designated as a historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979.

==Notable residents==
*John Giuca (born 1983), convicted of second-degree felony murder
*Doreen Giuliano, mother of John Giuca, went undercover to investigate possible juror misconduct in his trial
*Maya Wiley (born 1964), lawyer, professor, civil rights activist, and 2021 mayoral candidate for New York City

==Notable houses==
The Alvord Mansion at 1522 Albemarle Road was built by Alvord for his family. Later, it was purchased by Israel Matz, founder of the Ex-lax Company. The Alvord Mansion burned down c.1955 under mysterious conditions after its sale by the Matz family to apartment developers fell through in the face of community opposition.

<text>Shackleton Glacier () is a major Antarctic glacier, over long and from wide, descending from the Antarctic Plateau from the vicinity of Roberts Massif and flowing north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf between Mount Speed and Waldron Spurs. 
Discovered by the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) (1939–41) and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Sir Ernest Shackleton, British Antarctic explorer.

==Course==

The Shackleton Glacier originates in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and flows northeast between Dismal Buttress to the northwest and Roberts Massif to the southeast.
It is joined from the right (east) by Zaneveld Glacier, which also originates in the ice sheet.

Flowing north, the Shackleton Glacier is joined from the left (west) by the Gallup Glacier and the Baldwin Glacier and from the right (east) by McGregor Glacier just past Eckins Nunatak.

The Swithinbank Moraine extends north from Matador Mountain along the west side of the Shackleton Glacier to the Gemini Nunataks.
It crosses the mouths of the Gallup, Baldwin, Mincey and Field glaciers, left tributaries of the Shackleton Glacier.

Past Lockhart Ridge the Shackleton Glacier is joined from the right by the Yeats Glacier.
The glacier flows north through the Queen Maud Mountains, with the Anderson Heights to its west and the Cathedral Peaks to its east.
Below the Gemini nunataks the Gerasimou Glacier and Forman Glacier enter from the west before the mouth of the Shackleton Glacier.

<text>The Tidewater Railway, also known as the Tidewater Railway Company, was formed in 1904 as an intrastate railroad in Virginia, in the United States, by William N. Page, a civil engineer and entrepreneur, and his silent partner, millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers of Standard Oil fame. It was put together with the intention of creating an outlet to Hampton Roads, where coal mined along their older West Virginia short-line railroad, the Deepwater Railway, could be exported. In 1906, Thomas Davis Ranson served as vice president.

In 1907, the Tidewater Railway was renamed the &quot;Virginian Railway&quot;. A short time later, the Virginian Railway acquired its sister, the Deepwater Railway. Before the Tidewater division of the Virginian was linked to the Deepwater line, it played an important role, in conjunction with the regional Norfolk and Southern Railway, in transporting thousands of people to the Jamestown Exposition of 1907, an event marking the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the British colony at Jamestown. It took two years to complete, but in 1909, both portions (the Tidewater portion and the Deepwater portion) were finally completed, and coal exports, from a new coal pier at Sewell&#x27;s Point, began.

In 1959, the Virginian Railway was merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway. This was the first major U.S. railroad merger of the last half of the twentieth century, an era of rampant mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations among the American railroads.

<doc id="1160598" wikidata="Q2705895" url="?curid=1160598" title="Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion">
<text>Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion (c. 460 – c. 534), usually known as Cadwallon Lawhir (&quot;Long Hand&quot;) and also called Cadwallon I by some historians, was a king of Gwynedd around 500. 

Cadwallon was the son of Einion Yrth ap Cunedda and Prawst ferch Deithlyn. He is often considered to have been king of Gwynedd from his father&#x27;s death in about 500 until his own death in 534. 

He is credited with having driven the last Irish settlers off the island of Anglesey. According to one tradition, Cadwallon and his army padlocked their own feet to their stirrups so that they could not be tempted to flee the battle. Cadwallon&#x27;s opponent, the leader of the Irish of Angelsey, was said to be Serigi Wyddel (Serigi &quot;The Irishman&quot;), and the final battle was fought at either Cerrig y Gwyddyl or Llan y Gwyddyl near Holyhead.

Cadwallon&#x27;s epithet, &quot;Lawhir&quot;, may possibly refer to him having longer than usual arms or might also be a metaphor, referring to the extent of his authority. The late medieval poet Iolo Goch claims that he could &quot;reach a stone from the ground to kill a raven, without bending his back, because his arm was as long as his side to the ground.&quot;

According to Gildas, Cadwallon&#x27;s son, Maelgwn, murdered his uncle in order to ascend the throne, which suggests that the actual king of Gwynedd was not Cadwallon but his brother Owain Danwyn.

== Caswallon&#x27;s Llys ==
There has been a longstanding association, in antiquarian writings, between Cadwallon and a possible Llys (medieval royal court building) known as Caswallon&#x27;s Llys. This was indicated on the Ordnance Survey map of 1889 as within a field near Mynydd Eilian, in the Llaneilian community, in the north-east corner of the Isle of Anglesey. With no obvious remains by the 20th century, it had been largely discredited as a Llys site until a geophysical survey in 2009 identified foundations of a rectangular building within a trapezoidal enclosure, for which an early medieval site was a strong possibility.

<doc id="1160608" wikidata="Q1234296" url="?curid=1160608" title="Herbert Range">
<text>The Herbert Range () is a range in the Queen Maud Mountains of Antarctica, extending from the edge of the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Axel Heiberg Glacier and Strom Glacier.
Named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) for Walter W. Herbert, leader of the Southern Party of the New Zealand GSAE (1961–62) which explored the Axel Heiberg Glacier area.
==Course==
The Herbert Range runs from west to east between the Axel Heiberg Glacier to the south and the Strom Glacier to the north.
Peaks in the west include Gjelsvik Peak, Mount Fridtjof Nansen, Webster Knob and Mount Balchen.
Peaks further east include Bell Peak, Mount Cohen, Zigzag Bluff and Mount Betty, to the north of Bigend Saddle. Cohen Glacier runs north from Mount Cohen to join Strom Glacier.
Sargent Glacier runs southwest from Mount Cohen to join Axel Heiberg Glacier.

==Features==
Geographical features include:
===Gjelsvik Peak===
A peak, high, standing northwest of Mount Fridtjof Nansens. 
Named by the Southern Party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1961-62) for Tore Gjelsvik, Director of the Norsk Polarinstitutt, Oslo.

===Mount Fridtjof Nansen===
A high massive mountain, high, which dominates the area between the heads of Strom and Axel Heiberg Glaciers, in the Queen Maud Mountains. 
Discovered by Roald Amundsen in 1911, and named by him for Fridtjof Nansen, polar explorer, who helped support Amundsen&#x27;s expedition.

===Barracouta Ridge===
A long jagged ridge which terminates on the north in Webster Knob. 
The ridge is an extension from the base of Mount Fridtjof Nansen into the head of Strom Glacier.
Discovered and visited in 1929 by the geological party under Laurence Gould of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (ByrdAE), 1928-30. 
It was climbed by geologists of the Southern Party of the NZGSAE, 1963–64. 
The descriptive name, applied by the Southern Party derives from the appearance of the toothlike pinnacle along the crest of the ridge.

===Cenotaph Hill===
A rock peak, high, on the ridge separating the heads of Strom Glacier and Liv Glacier in the Queen Maud Mountains. 
The peak is north-northeast of the summit of Mount Fridtjof Nansen. 
It was visited by the Southern Party of NZGSAE (1963-64) who gave this name because the unusual knob of rock forming the summit resembles a monument.

===Mount Balchen===
A prominent peak, 3,085 m, standing east of the summit of Mount Fridtjof Nansen. 
Named by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) for Bernt Balchen, pilot with Roald Amundsen on Arctic flights, and with R. Admiral Richard E. Byrd on his South Pole flight of 1929.

===Bell Peak===
A peak, high, surmounting a southeast trending spur, just southwest of Sargent Glacier. 
The peak was probably observed by Roald Amundsen&#x27;s south polar party in 1911, and was later roughly mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30. 
Named by US-ACAN for G. Grant Bell who studied cosmic rays at McMurdo Station, winter party 1962.

===Mount Cohen===
A peak, high, standing southwest of Mount Betty in the Herbert Range. 
Discovered by Rear Admiral Byrd on several ByrdAE plane flights to the Queen Maud Mountains in November 1929, and named by him for Emanuel Cohen of Paramount Pictures, who assisted in assembling the motion picture records of the expedition.

===Zigzag Bluff===
A rock bluff at the foot of Herbert Range, overlooking Ross Ice Shelf about west of the terminus of Axel Heiberg Glacier.
Probably first seen by Roald Amundsen in 1911, the bluff was roughly mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30. 
So named by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE, 1961-62, because of the peculiar folding of the marble on the bluff.

===Mount Betty===
A small ridge overlooking Ross Ice Shelf, located on the north side of Bigend Saddle in the northeast extremity of the Herbert Range. 
Discovered in November 1911 by Captain Roald Amundsen, and named by him for Betty Andersson, nurse and housekeeper in the Amundsen family for many years.
A cairn was erected on the ridge by Amundsen on 6 January 1912, on his way back to Framheim from the South Pole. It is known as &quot;Amundsen’s cairn&quot; and has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 24), following a proposal by Norway to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

===Bigend Saddle===
A snow-covered saddle at the southwest side of Mount Betty in northern Herbert Range, Queen Maud Mountains. 
The saddle was traversed in December 1929 by the ByrdAE geological party under Laurence Gould. 
It was named by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE, 1963-64, because one of the party&#x27;s motor toboggans was abandoned here with a smashed big end bearing.

<doc id="1160613" wikidata="Q4397890" url="?curid=1160613" title="Dissolution of parliament in Latvia">
<text>The Constitution of Latvia, ratified on February 15, 1922, contains a provision regarding one of the reserve powers of the President of Latvia to initiate the dissolution of the parliament. According to Article 48-50 of the Constitution,

:::&quot;48. The President shall be entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima. Following this proposal, a national referendum shall be held. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast in favour of dissolution, the Saeima shall be considered dissolved, new elections called, and such elections held no later than two months after the date of the dissolution of the Saeima.&quot;
:::&quot;49. If the Saeima has been dissolved, the mandate of the members of the Saeima shall continue in effect until the newly elected Saeima has convened, but the dissolved Saeima may only hold sittings at the request of the President. The agenda of such sittings shall be determined by the President.&quot;
:::&quot;50. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast against the dissolution of the Saeima, then the President shall be deemed to be removed from office, and the Saeima shall elect a new President to serve for the remaining term of office of the President so removed.&quot;

Since 2009, Article 14 also foresees the right for the citizens without involvement of president:
:::&quot;14. Not less than one tenth of electors has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima. If the majority of voters and at least two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections of the Saeima vote in the national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima, then the Saeima shall be deemed recalled. The right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima may not be exercised one year after the convening of the Saeima and one year before the end of the term of office of the Saeima, during the last six months of the term of office of the President, as well as earlier than six months after the previous national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.&quot;
:::&quot;The electors may not recall any individual member of the Saeima.&quot;

Thus, the Constitution establishes one of the possible procedures to resolve a political crisis in a parliamentary republic by entitling the President, an otherwise largely ceremonial figure, to &quot;initiate&quot; the dissolution of parliament, but at the potential cost of his own office, should his initiative be rejected by popular vote.

This constitutional power was used for the first time in the history of the Latvian state by the President, Valdis Zatlers, on May 28, 2011. This move was in response to the parliament&#x27;s refusal to sanction a search at the home of Ainārs Šlesers, a Saeima member and former Cabinet minister. The referendum on the dissolution of parliament has to take place no later than two months time after the President&#x27;s decree. On May 30 the Central Election Commission resolved that the vote take place on July 23, 2011.

Previously, following the riots in Riga on January 13, 2009, President Zatlers promised to dissolve the Saeima unless it adopted amendments to the Constitution providing for the possibility of dissolving it by popular vote. These amendments were adopted by the Saeima on April 8, 2009, but on April 1, 2009, the President decided not to dissolve parliament.

The Latvian parliament, the Saeima, was also dissolved unconstitutionally on May 15, 1934 following a bloodless coup organized by then-Prime Minister Kārlis Ulmanis. The Cabinet declared a military state of emergency and suspended the activity of all parties which effectively put a ban on the work of the Saeima. This act was in direct violation of the Constitution and led to the establishment of an authoritarian regime.

<doc id="1160616" wikidata="Q7572155" url="?curid=1160616" title="Spa Valley Railway">
<text>The Spa Valley Railway (SVR) is a standard gauge heritage railway in the United Kingdom that runs from Tunbridge Wells West railway station in Royal Tunbridge Wells to High Rocks, Groombridge, and Eridge, where it links with the Oxted Line. 

It crosses the Kent and East Sussex border, covering a distance of , along the former Wealden Line between Tunbridge Wells Central and Lewes. The railway headquarters is also at Tunbridge Wells West railway station.

==History==

The railway was engineered by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, as part of the East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway (EGGTWR). This being an extension to the Three Bridges–Tunbridge Wells line which had been completed in 1855.

The EGGTWR was part of a regional race between the LB&amp;SCR and the SER, and a specific race to access the town of Royal Tunbridge Wells:

The LB&amp;SCR opened Tunbridge Wells West in 1866 as the eastern terminus of the EGGTW; there was also an extension to Tunbridge Wells Central. From Tunbridge Wells West railway station. There were direct services to the South Coast at Brighton and Eastbourne and to London Victoria. The Victoria services ran via Groombridge and Ashurst. A sign outside the station proudly proclaimed, &quot;New Route to London: Shortest, Quickest and Most Direct. Frequent Express Trains&quot;.

===Closure===

As the popularity of the motor car increased, train services were severely cut back due to the lack of patronage, and the number of services passing through Tunbridge Wells West railway station declined as one line after another was closed from the 1950s onwards. First, the East Grinstead to Lewes line closed in 1958, then the Cuckoo Line in 1965, the Three Bridges to Groombridge in 1967, and finally the Wealden Line south of Uckfield in 1969. The line between Tunbridge Wells and Eridge was itself listed for closure in 1966, only to be subsequently reprieved. The line remained open, although in its latter years passenger services were mainly confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge (via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central – now plain Tunbridge Wells) and Eridge with a few through trains to Uckfield. However, there was a depot at Tunbridge Wells West which housed rolling stock for services on the Uckfield– and East Grinstead–London (via East Croydon) lines, and there were several empty stock moves early and late in the day.

By the early 1980s, the track and signalling needed to be replaced and British Rail were planning an upgrade of the Tonbridge to Hastings Line. British Rail therefore, announced the proposed closure of the line (including Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells West stations) from 16 May 1983 which was later deferred after public objections. It was announced in February 1985 that the Secretary of State for Transport agreed to the withdrawal of passenger services deciding that the cost of keeping the line open from Birchden Jn to Grove Jn and undertaking renewing Grove Junction did not justify the outlay. The passenger service was withdrawn from 8 July 1985 although the section between Tunbridge Wells West and Birchden Jn remained open for rolling stock movements until 10 August, when the depot at Tunbridge Wells West station was shut. At the time of closure, Tunbridge Wells West station had gas lighting, which was in operation in the ticket office and under the canopy.

==Preservation==

===Restoration===
The SVR has its origins in a charitable society formed on 13 September 1985, to purchase and reopen the Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge line. Named the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society (TWERPS), it began a long struggle to reopen the line. The campaign received a setback in the late 1980s when Tunbridge Wells Borough Council gave planning permission for the construction of a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket complex on the site of the derelict station site of Tunbridge Wells West. While the 1891 locomotive shed and station building were protected as listed buildings, the remaining area of the site was obliterated, including the goods shed and signal boxes. However, planning permission was subject to the condition that the developer pay for construction of a new station platform and restoration of the engine shed.

The North Downs Steam Railway relocated from Dartford in 1996, where it was experiencing vandalism problems, and merged with TWERPS. It transferred its assets and helped establish a base in the former LB&amp;SCR locomotive shed. The group had also acquired the line as far as Birchden Junction during that year. Alongside the loco shed, a new platform was built, from where services began running to Cold Bath Bridge (about away) in December 1996. Services were extended to Groombridge in August 1997 and to Birchden Junction in 2005.

In 2007, SVR marked the 10th anniversary of the opening of the line by transforming Groombridge into a busy interchange station, with trains arriving or departing every 15 minutes. The funds raised from this event went towards the &quot;Return to Eridge&quot; appeal to raise £500,000 for the extension to the Uckfield main line at Eridge. On 25 March 2011 the SVR extended passenger services to Eridge, where there is a footbridge interchange with Southern services on the London Bridge to Uckfield line.

In August 2017, a special event (&quot;20th Birthday Bash&quot;) was held to celebrate 20 years since the reopening of the line to Groombridge, starring a variety of home and visiting locomotives, including BR Standard 4 Tank 80078.

<text>The Slamdance Film Festival is an annual film festival focused on emerging artists. The annual week-long festival is held in Los Angeles in late February and is the main event organized by the year-round Slamdance organization. The organization also hosts a screenplay competition, workshops, screenings throughout the year, and events with an emphasis on independent films with budgets under $1 million.

==History==
The festival was founded in 1995 by Dan Mirvish, Jon Fitzgerald, Shane Kuhn, and Peter Baxter in addition to Paul Rachman, after they had been unsuccessful in submitting films to the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Baxter has been in charge of Slamdance since 1997.

==Screenplay competition==
In addition to the festival, Slamdance&#x27;s screenplay competition has discovered a number of talented screenwriters including Joshua Marston (&quot;Maria Full of Grace&quot;) as well as Steven Fechter and Nicole Kassell (co-writers of &quot;The Woodsman&quot;). In 2008, Slamdance entered into an agreement with Upload Films to develop and produce &quot;Drool&quot;, the winner of Slamdance&#x27;s screenplay competition. Written and directed by Nancy Kissam, &quot;Drool&quot; premiered at the 2009 Festival and thereafter was acquired by Strand Releasing. Chad Crawford Kinkle&#x27;s southern horror screenplay &quot;Jug Face&quot; won the 2011 Grand Prize. During the 2012 Festival, Modernciné producers Andrew van den Houten and Robert Tonino announced their production of &quot;Jug Face&quot; in Nashville.

In 2011, &quot;Dead in the Room&quot;, written by Marjory Kaptanoglu (winner of Slamdance&#x27;s 2010 Short Screenplay Competition) was directed by Academy Award–nominated filmmaker Adam Pertofsky. In 2012, &quot;Harold&#x27;s Bad Day&quot;, written by R.J. Buckley, was directed by Slamdance alum Jordan Brady. The 2011 Grand Prize winner &quot;Jug Face&quot;, written by Chad Crawford Kinkle, premiered at the 2013 festival, where it was picked up for distribution by Gravitas Ventures.

The Slamdance 2013 Screenwriting Competition was presented by JuntoBox Films. Awards were given to the top three scripts in each category, with a Grand Prize of $10,000 cash that went to &quot;Butterfly Children&quot; by Melanie Schiele. The Short Screenplay winner &quot;Think Ink&quot; by Emily Hu was produced and premiered at the 2015 Festival, as part of the Special Screenings section. An original teleplay (&quot;Search for Life&quot; by Andrea Janakas) took home the Grand Prize at the 2014 Screenplay Competition. &quot;Search for Life&quot; was also given the award for Best Original Teleplay, the Best Narrative Feature was given to HF Crum&#x27;s &quot;The 3 Faces of Hunger &amp; Thirst&quot;, the Best Horror Screenplay was given to Sean Patrick Geraghty&#x27;s &quot;The Hounds of House Rearden&quot;, and the Best Short Screenplay was given to David Shushan&#x27;s &quot;Over the Line (And Far Away)&quot;. The awards were given at the Writers Guild of America West in Los Angeles.

The 2015 Screenplay Competition received a record-breaking 50% increase in submissions, with nearly 3,500 total submissions. Narrative Feature script &quot;The Delegation&quot; by Shane Andries was awarded the Best Narrative Feature and Grand Prize Award, Best Horror Screenplay was awarded to &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; by Jesse J. Cook, Best Short Screenplay was awarded to &quot;Deep Storage&quot; by Susan Earl, and the Best Teleplay was awarded to &quot;Castle Rock&quot; by Jamie King. The awards were given at the Writers Guild of America West in Los Angeles.

The 2016 Screenplay Competition received a record-breaking number of submissions, with 3,600 total scripts submitted. Narrative Feature script &quot;Great White Shark&quot; by Andrew Kightlinger was awarded the Best Narrative Feature and Grand Prize Award, Best Horror Screenplay was awarded to &quot;The Housesitter&quot; by Suju Vijayan, Best Short Screenplay was awarded to &quot;Conviction&quot; by Anju Andre-Bergmann, and Best Teleplay was awarded to &quot;Feral&quot; by Bryan Kett. The awards were given at the Writers Guild of America West in Los Angeles. Andrew Kightlinger has received representation from Principato-Young Entertainment and is currently in development on a new narrative feature which focuses on sex trafficking.

The 2017 Screenplay Competition received over 3,000 submissions. Horror Feature &quot;Day Shift&quot; by Tyler Tice was awarded $2,000 for Best Horror Screenplay and $8,000 for the Grand Prize Award. Best Narrative Feature was awarded to &quot;Escher&quot; by Jason Kessler, Best Short Screenplay was awarded to &quot;The Clown-Faced Plumber&quot; by Frederick Jones, and Best Teleplay to &quot;Jackrabbit&quot; by David Schlow. The awards were given at the Writers Guild of America West in Los Angeles.

== Slamdance on the Road ==
The Slamdance organization has established Slamdance on the Road, a traveling showcase supported by the festival and its filmmakers. On the Road brings popular Slamdance films to audiences that otherwise would not have the chance to see them and provide theatrical venues with an alternative film program experience. On the Road events usually happen in U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, Austin, and Detroit, but have also traveled to countries including Canada, China, Poland, France, and Chile.

== Slamdance Cinema Club ==
In 2015, as a further development of its theatrical distribution efforts, Slamdance announced a partnership with ArcLight Hollywood to produce and promote the Slamdance Cinema Club, which features two Slamdance films a month for the first three quarters of 2015.

== Slamdance Presents ==
In January 2010, Slamdance and Microsoft announced its partnership of year-round Slamdance Film programming on Xbox and Zune. Slamdance president and co-founder Peter Baxter said, “Slamdance has a true independent identity and proven track record of unearthing great films. It&#x27;s time now to be progressive and unleash our film programs outside of the festival and directly help filmmakers find popular, worldwide audiences. The standard of Slamdance films deserve this much and we believe the audience will respond.”

As of opening day at the 2011 Festival, select Competition Feature Films were made available via Zune Video Marketplace as part of this year&#x27;s Festival and VOD Showcase for the duration of the festival, January 20–27. Select films included narrative features &quot;Modern Imbecile&#x27;s Planet World&quot;, &quot;Snow on tha Bluff&quot; by Damon Russell, and &quot;The Beast Pageant&quot; by Albert Birney &amp; Jon Moses; documentary features &quot;Road Dogs&quot; and &quot;Scrapper&quot;, as well as films from previous years’ festivals. In 2013, Slamdance expanded its VOD business onto iTunes, Amazon, Google, Vudu, and PlayStation. Slamdance Studios acquired and released four Slamdance favorites and award winners through Cinedigm/New Video, including Monteith McCollum&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid&quot;, Ron Eyal and Eleanor Burke&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, Rudd Simmons&#x27; &quot;The First Season&quot;, and Daniel Martinico&#x27;s &quot;OK, Good&quot;.

Also in 2013, &quot;The Slam Collective&quot; made Slamdance&#x27;s first collaborative feature film called &quot;I Want to Be an American&quot;. In the spirit of the surrealist parlor game of chance Exquisite Corpse, 7 Slamdance filmmakers each made a documentary short film based on imagery forwarded on by the previous filmmaker in the chain. In January 2015, Slamdance Studios launched a streaming program on Hulu that includes Slamdance favorites and independent classics including Marc Levin&#x27;s &quot;Slam&quot;, Cullen Hoback&#x27;s &quot;Terms and Conditions May Apply&quot;, and Gerard Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Tony&quot;. The Slamdance-produced short film &quot;D.I.Y.&quot;, featuring conversations with prominent Slamdance alumni Christopher Nolan, Penelope Spheeris, and the Russo brothers premiered on the platform.

In 2015, Slamdance partnered with filmmakers Steve Yu and Diamond Dallas Page for a theatrical release of &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot; as the first title for Slamdance Presents, a distribution enterprise dedicated to creating theatrical and other commercial opportunities for independent filmmakers. &quot;The Resurrection Of Jake The Snake&quot; documents the rehabilitation of Jake Roberts and Scott Hall. The film played in the United States and Canada including Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. After its VOD release, &quot;The Resurrection Of Jake The Snake&quot; became the number one documentary on iTunes. In 2017, Slamdance Presents acquired four award-winning and critically acclaimed films now available on VOD: &quot;Driftwood&quot; by Paul Taylor, &quot;Dead Hands Dig Deep&quot; by Jai Love, &quot;Without&quot; by Mark Jackson, and &quot;The Ground We Won&quot; by Christopher Pryor.

<doc id="1160619" wikidata="Q585408" url="?curid=1160619" title="Northern Nigeria Protectorate">
<text>Northern Nigeria (Hausa: &quot;Arewacin Najeriya&quot;) was a British protectorate which lasted from 1900 until 1914, and covered the northern part of what is now Nigeria.

The protectorate spanned and included the emirates of the Sokoto Caliphate and parts of the former Bornu Empire, conquered in 1902. The first High Commissioner of the protectorate was Frederick Lugard, who suppressed slavery and tribal raiding and created a system of administration built around native authorities.

The Protectorate was ended on 1 January 1914, when its area was unified with the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Lagos Colony, becoming the Northern Province of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.

==Foundation==

The Berlin Conference of 1884 and 1885 provided the area that would become the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to the British. The Royal Niger Company was formed in 1886 with George Taubman Goldie as the vice governor. The Company moved in-land and negotiated trade agreements and political agreements, sometimes coercive, with several local chieftains. In 1897, Frederick Lugard was the appointed head of the West African Frontier Force which was tasked with stopping Fulani resistance and possible French incursions in the northwest area.

On 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company&#x27;s charter was revoked and the British government took control, in a ceremony where Lugard read the proclamation. The Royal Niger Company was paid £865,000 and was given the rights to half of all mining revenue in a large part of the areas for 99 years in exchange for ceding the territory to the British government. Lord Lugard was appointed the High Commissioner of the newly created Northern Nigeria Protectorate. Lokoja was the capital from 1900, but Zungeru became the headquarters for the protectorate in 1902 because it was the most northerly city accessible by river transport.

==Military campaign==
Military operations began in 1902 and continued for about five years of sporadic fighting. The remnants of the Bornu Empire were conquered in 1902 and the Sokoto Caliphate and was defeated in the Battle of Kano. Fighting continued in 1904 in Bassa. In 1906, a Mahdist rebellion broke out outside the city of Sokoto in the village of Satiru. Elements of the Royal West African Frontier Force were dispatched to suppress the rebellion; upon hearing news of what had transpired, Muhammadu Attahiru II dispatched a mixed force of 300 Sokoto cavalry and infantry led by Mallam Isa to join them. The combined force successfully suppressed the rebellion, which marked the last major instance of armed resistance to British rule in the region. After 1907 there were fewer revolts and use of military force by the British and the focus of the High Commissioner turned toward taxation and administration.

==Administration==
The British Administration began with Frederick Lugard as the first High Commissioner. In 1907, Lugard left Nigeria for Hong Kong and Percy Girouard became the new High Commissioner. Girouard had a long history of rail construction in Canada and Africa and was tasked with substantial railroad construction in the Protectorate. In 1909, Henry Hesketh Bell, the governor of the Uganda Protectorate was appointed high commissioner. In 1912, it was estimated that the area of Northern Nigeria was approximately and had a population of about 10 million people. Charles Lindsay Temple became the acting Head Commissioner in 1911 and 1912 and began overseeing, with close collaboration with Lugard, the creation of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.

One defining characteristic of administration in Northern Nigeria Protectorate was the inclusion of chiefs and emirsincluding the emir of Bornuas &quot;native authorities&quot; fitting into British administration (cf. the similar practice with chiefs, rajas, and maharajas in British India). Taxation proved very difficult in the protectorate for the first years of British rule. Lugard&#x27;s attempts to institute poll taxes were foiled by the Emirates, the need to introduce coin controversy and attempts to tax trade were opposed by powerful merchants. This created a substantial deficit in the budget of the Protectorate and public works projects had to be paid by grants from the British Empire. As a result, the British often had significant shortages of British personnel before 1907. These pragmatic concerns resulted in incorporation of the traditional authorities within the British structure.

These same financial and administrative challenges resulted in discussions led by Lugard for the unification of the Lagos Colony, the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, and Northern Nigeria. The disparities between the protectorates was to be corrected by creating a central administration in Lagos, with custom revenues from the south paying for the projects in the north. The unified Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria began in 1914 and had two lieutenant governors with one responsible for the area of the southern province and another responsible for the northern province. The administration in the north remained largely separate and included and deepened the use of native authorities. These divisions have been found to persist in many respects to this day.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]].

==First stamps==
Postage stamps were issued specifically for the Northern Nigeria Protectorate beginning in 1900. All stamps of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate are definitive issues of a Key Plate design, differing in the sovereign depicted, type of paper, watermarks, and choice of colored or colorless numerals for the denomination.

The first series consisted of nine stamps with values ranging from 1/2 pence to 10 shillings, depicting Queen Victoria. The second series, consisting of identical denominations, but in slightly different colors was issued on July 1, 1902, depicting King Edward VII. Unusually, a £25 stamp was issued in April 1904. This was really intended as a revenue stamp, it being nearly impossible to invent a piece of mail needing so much postage. It was used to pay for imported liquor licences. It is the great rarity of philately with copies commanding a high price. The King Edward series was reissued in 1905 in eight denominations, and again in 1910–11 in eleven denominations.

The final series of stamps for the Northern Nigeria Protectorate was a series of thirteen denominations depicting King George V.

Stamps of Northern Nigeria were replaced by those of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914.

==Borgu local post==

A local post briefly existed at Borgu in 1905 for which crudely made one penny stamps were produced.

<doc id="1160623" wikidata="Q356407" url="?curid=1160623" title="John Snow">
<text>John Snow (15 March 1813 – 16 June 1858) was an English physician and a leader in the development of anaesthesia and medical hygiene. He is considered one of the founders of modern epidemiology and early germ theory, in part because of his work in tracing the source of a cholera outbreak in London&#x27;s Soho, which he identified as a particular public water pump. Snow&#x27;s findings inspired fundamental changes in the water and waste systems of London, which led to similar changes in other cities, and a significant improvement in general public health around the world.

== Early life and education ==
Snow was born on 15 March 1813 in York, England, the first of nine children born to William and Frances Snow in their North Street home, and was baptised at All Saints&#x27; Church, North Street, York. His father was a labourer who worked at a local coal yard, by the Ouse, constantly replenished from the Yorkshire coalfield by barges, but later was a farmer in a small village to the north of York.

The neighbourhood was one of the poorest in the city, and was frequently in danger of flooding because of its proximity to the River Ouse. Growing up, Snow experienced unsanitary conditions and contamination in his hometown. Most of the streets were unsanitary and the river was contaminated by runoff water from market squares, cemeteries and sewage.

From a young age, Snow demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics. In 1827, when he was 14, he obtained a medical apprenticeship with William Hardcastle in the area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered a cholera epidemic for the first time in Killingworth, a coal-mining village. Snow treated many victims of the disease and thus gained experience. Eventually he adjusted to teetotalism and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an abstinence pledge in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was &quot;pure&quot;. Between 1832 and 1835 Snow worked as an assistant to a colliery surgeon, first in Burnopfield, County Durham, and then in Pateley Bridge, West Riding of Yorkshire. In October 1836 he enrolled at the Hunterian school of medicine on Great Windmill Street, London.

== Career ==
In the 1830s, Snow&#x27;s colleague at the Newcastle Infirmary was surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow. The surgeons worked together conducting research on England&#x27;s cholera epidemics, both continuing to do so for many years.

In 1837, Snow began working at the Westminster Hospital. Admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the University of London in December 1844 and was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1850. Snow was a founding member of the Epidemiological Society of London which was formed in May 1850 in response to the cholera outbreak of 1849. By 1856, Snow and Greenhow&#x27;s nephew, Dr. E.H. Greenhow were some of a handful of esteemed medical men of the society who held discussions on this &quot;dreadful scourge, the cholera&quot;.

After finishing his medical studies in the University of London, he earned his MD in 1844. Snow set up his practice at 54 Frith Street in Soho as a surgeon and general practitioner. John Snow contributed to a wide range of medical concerns including anaesthesiology. He was a member of the Westminster Medical Society, an organisation dedicated to clinical and scientific demonstrations. Snow gained prestige and recognition all the while being able to experiment and pursue many of his scientific ideas. He was a speaker multiple times at the society&#x27;s meetings and he also wrote and published articles. He was especially interested in patients with respiratory diseases and tested his hypothesis through animal studies. In 1841, he wrote, &quot;On Asphyxiation, and on the Resuscitation of Still-Born Children&quot;, which is an article that discusses his discoveries on the physiology of neonatal respiration, oxygen consumption and the effects of body temperature change.

In 1857, Snow made an early and often overlooked contribution to epidemiology in a pamphlet, &quot;On the adulteration of bread as a cause of rickets&quot;.

=== Anaesthesia ===

Snow&#x27;s interest in anaesthesia and breathing was evident from 1841 and beginning in 1843, he experimented with ether to see its effects on respiration. Only a year after ether was introduced to Britain, in 1847, he published a short work titled, &quot;On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether,&quot; which served as a guide for its use. At the same time, he worked on various papers that reported his clinical experience with anaesthesia, noting reactions, procedures and experiments. Within two years of ether being introduced, Snow was the most accomplished anaesthetist in Britain. London&#x27;s principal surgeons suddenly wanted his assistance.

As well as ether, John Snow studied chloroform, which was introduced in 1847 by James Young Simpson, a Scottish obstetrician. He realised that chloroform was much more potent and required more attention and precision when administering it. Snow first realised this with Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old patient who died on 28 January 1848 after a surgical procedure that required the cutting of her toenail. She was administered chloroform by covering her face with a cloth dipped in the substance. However, she quickly lost pulse and died. After investigating her death and a couple of deaths that followed, he realized that chloroform had to be administered carefully and published his findings in a letter to &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

John Snow was one of the first physicians to study and calculate dosages for the use of ether and chloroform as surgical anaesthetics, allowing patients to undergo surgical and obstetric procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. He designed the apparatus to safely administer ether to the patients and also designed a mask to administer chloroform. Snow published an article on ether in 1847 entitled &quot;On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether&quot;. A longer version entitled &quot;On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration&quot; was published posthumously in 1858.

Although he thoroughly worked with ether as an anaesthetic, he never attempted to patent it; instead, he continued to work and publish written works on his observations and research.

=== Obstetric anaesthesia ===
Snow&#x27;s work and findings were related to both anaesthesia and the practice of childbirth. His experience with obstetric patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, amylene and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby, they would only feel the first half of the contraction and be on the border of unconsciousness, but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person that was not the surgeon applied it.

The use of chloroform as an anaesthetic for childbirth was seen as unethical by many physicians and even the Church of England. However, on 7 April 1853, Queen Victoria asked John Snow to administer chloroform during the delivery of her eighth child, Leopold. He then repeated the procedure for the delivery of her daughter Beatrice in 1857. This led to wider acceptance of obstetrical anaesthesia.

=== Cholera ===
Snow was a skeptic of the then-dominant miasma theory that stated that diseases such as cholera and bubonic plague were caused by pollution or a noxious form of &quot;bad air&quot;. The germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, so Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. He first published his theory in an 1849 essay, &quot;On the Mode of Communication of Cholera&quot;, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the Soho epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents (with the help of Henry Whitehead), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Although Snow&#x27;s chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle (force rod). This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline:


Snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that homes supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, which was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames, had a cholera rate fourteen times that of those supplied by Lambeth Waterworks Company, which obtained water from the upriver, cleaner Seething Wells. Snow&#x27;s study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.
Snow wrote:

Researchers later discovered that this public well had been dug only from an old cesspit, which had begun to leak faecal bacteria. The cloth nappy of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

Thomas Shapter had conducted similar studies and used a point-based map for the study of cholera in Exeter, seven years before John Snow, although this did not identify the water supply problem that was later held responsible.

==== Political controversy ====
After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the Broad Street pump handle. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow&#x27;s theory. To accept his proposal would have meant indirectly accepting the fecal-oral route of disease transmission, which was too unpleasant for most of the public to contemplate.

It was not until 1866 that William Farr, one of Snow&#x27;s chief opponents, realised the validity of his diagnosis when investigating another outbreak of cholera at Bromley by Bow and issued immediate orders that unboiled water was not to be drunk.

Farr denied Snow&#x27;s explanation of how exactly the contaminated water spread cholera, although he did accept that water had a role in the spread of the illness. In fact, some of the statistical data that Farr collected helped promote John Snow&#x27;s views.

Public health officials recognise the political struggles in which reformers have often become entangled. During the annual Pumphandle Lecture in England, members of the John Snow Society remove and replace a pump handle to symbolise the continuing challenges for advances in public health.
== Personal life ==

Snow was known to swim as a hobby for exercise. He became a vegetarian at the age of 17 and was a teetotaller. He embraced a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet by supplementing his vegetables with dairy products and eggs for eight years. Whilst in his thirties he became a vegan. His health deteriorated and he suffered a renal disorder which he attributed to his vegan diet so he took up meat-eating and drinking wine. He continued drinking pure water (via boiling) throughout his adult life. He never married.

In 1830, Snow became a member of the temperance movement. In 1845, he became a member of York Temperance Society. After his health declined it was only about 1845 that he consumed a little wine to aid digestion.

Snow lived at 18 Sackville Street, London, from 1852 to his death in 1858.

Snow suffered a stroke while working in his London office on 10 June 1858. He was 45 years old at the time. He never recovered, dying six days later on 16 June 1858. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

It has been speculated that his premature death may have been related to his frequent exposure and experimentation with anesthetic gases, which is now known to have numerous adverse health effects. Snow administered and experimented with ether, chloroform, ethyl nitrate, carbon disulfide, benzene, bromoform, ethyl bromide and dichloroethane during his lifetime.

<doc id="1160626" wikidata="Q1393832" url="?curid=1160626" title="Moutohora Island">
<text>Moutohora Island (previously known as Whale Island) () is a small uninhabited island located off the Bay of Plenty coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, about north of the town of Whakatāne. The island is a remnant of a complex volcano which has eroded, leaving two peaks. This is still an area of volcanic activity and there are hot springs on the island in Sulphur Valley, McEwans Bay, and Sulphur Bay.

==Name==
The Māori name, , is a contracted form of , meaning &quot;Whale Island&quot; or &quot;Captured Whale&quot;. The spelling &quot;Moutohorā&quot; (with a macron) is sometimes also used in English, although the official name of the island omits it. The spelling &quot;Motuhora&quot; is also used. ( is the Māori name for the southern right whale.)

==History==

Numerous archaeological sites of both Māori and European origin have been recorded, including an extensive pa (fortified earthworks) site on Pa Hill and a number of house terraces and garden sites, middens (food refuse dumps), stone tool manufacture areas and stone walls. After permanent Maori occupation ceased in the early nineteenth century, Ngāti Awa and Tūhoe continued to visit the island for sea food and muttonbirds and to collect stones for hāngī (underground ovens).

The first European occupation came in the 1830s with an unsuccessful attempt to establish a shore-based whaling station. The venture failed without a single whale being captured. Forty years later came attempts to make money from sulphur. It was extracted and sold to a refinery in Auckland over a number of years but was of poor quality, and the venture was abandoned in 1895. The next phase of industrial activity came in 1915, when quarrying provided rock for the construction of the Whakatāne harbour wall. A total of of rock was removed over five years.

==Local government==
The island is not included in the boundaries of a territorial authority council (district council) and the Minister of Local Government is its territorial authority, with support from the Department of Internal Affairs.

==Ecology==
In 1965 Moutohora was declared as a wildlife refuge, named as &quot;Moutohora Wildlife Management Reserve&quot;, and the island was bought by the Crown in 1984. Once the goats which had been introduced to the island were eradicated, a planting programme began and 12,000 plants covering 45 species are now established. Today Moutohora is covered with a mosaic of pōhutukawa, māhoe, kānuka, bracken and grassland.

There are 190 native and 110 introduced plant species. The island is now completely free of the goats, rats, cats and rabbits which previously devastated native plants and animals. The most significant feature of Moutohora&#x27;s current fauna is the breeding colony of grey-faced petrels. Sooty shearwaters, little blue penguins, the threatened New Zealand dotterel and variable oystercatchers also breed on the island. Threatened species which are occasional visitors are the Caspian tern, the North Island kaka and New Zealand falcon. Other species present include common forest birds, captive-bred red crowned parakeets, three lizard species and fur seals. Surrounding areas hosts rich marine ecosystem including cetaceans, oceanic birds, sharks. Most common of cetaceans are smaller species such as common and bottlenose dolphins, pilot whales, and killer whales while larger migratory baleen whales (southern rights and rorquals) and toothed whales including beaked whales also appear from time to time.
In March 1999 local Ngati Awa and the New Zealand Department of Conservation joined forces to see the fulfilment of a dream. Forty North Island saddleback (tieke) were transferred from Cuvier Island (Repanga), off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, to Moutohora.

This relocation followed the traditional flight made centuries ago when the Mataatua waka (canoe) was accompanied by two tīeke from Repanga to Whakatāne. This flight followed the drowning of the twin sons of Muriwai, sister of Toroa, the captain of the waka. The two tieke settled briefly on Moutohora before returning to Cuvier Island.

==Access==
Public access to Moutohora is restricted to Department of Conservation concession holders and approved scientific parties. During periods of high fire danger all access may be declined. The current concession holders are the local Maori tribe of Ngati Awa and tourist operators.

==In popular culture==
In the fictional &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, Moutohora is the home of a professional Quidditch team, the Moutohora Macaws. The team players wear robes of red, yellow and blue.

<text>The Marvel Family, also known as the Shazam Family (also Shazamily), are a group of superheroes who originally appeared in books published by Fawcett Comics and were later acquired by DC Comics. Created in 1942 by writer Otto Binder and artist Marc Swayze, the team was created as an extension of Fawcett&#x27;s Captain Marvel franchise, and included Marvel&#x27;s sister Mary Marvel, their friend Captain Marvel Jr., and, at various times, a number of other characters as well.

Because Marvel Comics trademarked their own Captain Marvel comic book during the interim between the demise of the Fawcett Comics&#x27; Captain Marvel comics in 1953 and DC&#x27;s revival in 1972, DC Comics is today unable to promote and market Captain Marvel under that name. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark &quot;Shazam!&quot; for their comic book titles with the Marvel Family characters, and the name under which they market and promote the characters. When referring to the Marvel Family on comic book covers or various merchandise, they are by this legal necessity called the &quot;Shazam Family&quot;.

In 2012, DC officially changed Captain Marvel&#x27;s name to &quot;Shazam&quot;, making &quot;Shazam Family&quot; the name of the superhero&#x27;s associates. In current continuity, the Shazam Family comprises the superpowered alter egos of Billy Batson (teenaged alter-ego of Shazam, formerly Captain Marvel) and his foster siblings: Mary Bromfield (formerly Mary Marvel), Freddy Freeman (formerly Captain Marvel Jr.), Darla Dudley, Pedro Peña, and Eugene Choi.

The Shazam Family made their cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Shazam!&quot;, released in 2019 by New Line Cinema and Warner Bros., and returned in the 2023 sequel, &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot;.

==Publication history==
The Marvel Family was established in 1942 after the introductions of Captain Marvel&#x27;s partners, the Lieutenant Marvels (&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #21, September 1941), Captain Marvel Jr. (&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #25, December 1941) and Mary Marvel (&quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18, December 1942). With Junior and Mary&#x27;s additions to his adventures, Captain Marvel became the first superhero to have a team of sidekicks who share his powers, abilities, and appearance; a concept later adapted for heroes such as Superman, Batman, and Aquaman, among others.

The members of the Marvel Family appeared both separately and together in many of Fawcett&#x27;s comic book series, including &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;, &quot;Wow Comics&quot;, &quot;Master Comics&quot;, &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot;, &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot;, &quot;Mary Marvel&quot;, and &quot;The Marvel Family&quot;. By the late 1940s, Marvel Family comics were among the most popular in the industry, and the Marvel Family had expanded to include both non-superpowered characters (Uncle Marvel and Freckles Marvel) and even talking animals (Hoppy the Marvel Bunny). By 1953, all of these books had ceased publication, due to Superman publisher DC Comics&#x27; lawsuit against Fawcett.

In 1972, DC licensed the rights to the Marvel Family characters, and began publishing them in a comic series titled &quot;Shazam!&quot;. Fawcett sold DC the rights to the characters in 1980, by which time &quot;Shazam!&quot; had been cancelled, and the Marvels had been relegated the back-up feature of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, and, later, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. DC retconned Captain Marvel in 1986 with their &quot;Legends&quot; miniseries, establishing him as a solo hero without a team. Writer/artist Jerry Ordway resurrected the Marvel Family in 1995 with his &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series, establishing the team as being made up solely of Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. Following several attempts at relaunching the &quot;Shazam!&quot; franchise during the mid-2000s, the Marvel Family was temporarily dissolved by writers Geoff Johns and Jerry Ordway in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #25, with only Captain Marvel Jr., now known as &quot;Shazam&quot;, retaining his powers, but from another source. In the interim, Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel continued to appear in &quot;Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!&quot;, an all-ages comic book series published under DC&#x27;s youth-oriented Johnny DC line which ran from 2008 to 2010. Captain Marvel Jr. joined the pair towards the end of the run of &quot;Magic of Shazam!&quot;, following a brief period serving as the sidekick of the Marvels&#x27; enemy under the name Black Adam Jr.

The Shazam Family was reintroduced during DC Comics&#x27; continuity-altering &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries in 2011, as six kids who all spoke &quot;Shazam!&quot; in unison to become one superhero, Captain Thunder. In the later company-wide &quot;New 52&quot; reboot that followed &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the Captain Marvel character was renamed &quot;Shazam&quot; and starred in a backup segment of the &quot;Justice League&quot; series (second volume) from 2012 to 2013. These backups, by writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank, introduced Billy Batson/Shazam and his new Shazam Family, consisting of Billy and his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers.

In 2022, DC published a facsimile edition of &quot;Marvel Family Comics&quot; No. 1 as a tie-in with the release of the film &quot;Black Adam&quot;.

==Marvel/Shazam Family members==
===Primary members===
====Billy Batson (Captain Marvel/Shazam)====

The &quot;World&#x27;s Mightiest Mortal&quot;, Captain Marvel is the superpowered alter-ego of Billy Batson, an orphaned boy who speaks the name of the wizard Shazam to become an adult superhero. Billy has the powers of Solomon (wisdom), Hercules (strength), Atlas (stamina), Zeus (power), Achilles (courage), and Mercury (speed); and served as the wizard Shazam&#x27;s champion and herald.

In the Golden Age and Bronze Age comics, Billy chose to share his powers with his sister Mary and his friend Freddy Freeman, creating the Marvel Family. Outside of the Marvel Family, Captain Marvel served briefly as a member of both the Justice League International and the Justice Society of America.

After the 2011 New 52 reboot of the &quot;Shazam!&quot; characters by Geoff Johns &amp; Gary Frank, Billy Batson is a troubled foster child who has inherited the name, powers, and seat on the council of magic of the wizard Shazam. Becoming a hero inspired the initially brash and standoffish Billy to evolve into a noble hero and leader who embraces his new foster family. As &quot;Shazam&quot;, Billy has powers and a red-uniformed appearance similar to the traditional version of Captain Marvel with the added ability to wield magic via the &quot;living lightning&quot; that powers him. For a time, Shazam was infected by the Batman Who Laughs with Joker Venom and became King Shazam (while Billy became a Robin).

====Mary Bromfield (Mary Marvel)====

In traditional &quot;Shazam!&quot; stories, Mary is Billy&#x27;s once-lost twin sister Mary Batson. She is technically the oldest twin in the pair (adopted as Mary Bromfield), who found she could say the magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot; and become a Marvel as well. The Golden Age Mary Marvel remained a teenager in superhero form, while the modern version is transformed into an adult like her brother. The Golden Age Mary Marvel had a different set of patrons from Captain Marvel who contributed to her powers. They were Selene (grace), Hippolyte (strength), Ariadne (skill), Zephyrus (swiftness), Aurora (beauty) and Minerva (wisdom).

During the 2007 and 2008 limited series &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Mary Marvel lost her powers and gained the powers of Marvel Family foe Black Adam. She temporarily became a villain working for Darkseid and possessed by the New God DeSaad.

In current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Mary Bromfield is Billy Batson&#x27;s foster sister, having run away from an abusive home at a young age and being placed in the Vázquez home. The oldest of the Shazam kids, Mary acts as the &quot;den mother&quot; and conscience of the group. She shares Billy&#x27;s secret, and by saying &quot;Shazam!&quot; she can gain a superpowered form similar to the traditional Mary Marvel in a red uniform.

====Freddy Freeman (Captain Marvel Jr.)====

In both the Golden Age and 1990s versions of the Marvel Family, Billy&#x27;s friend and classmate, Freddy Freeman, was attacked and left disabled by the supervillain Captain Nazi, and was given the power to become a Marvel to save his life. Whenever he spoke Captain Marvel&#x27;s name, Freddy becomes a teenage version of Captain Marvel. This created the odd problem that he could not identify himself without changing back to his regular form.

During the mid-1990s, the Freddy character went by the alias &quot;CM3&quot; (short for &quot;Captain Marvel Three&quot;, &quot;CM1&quot; being Billy and &quot;CM2&quot; being Mary) so that he could identify himself without transforming. He was a member of the Teen Titans during the late 1990s and later, the Outsiders in the early 2000s. The 2006–2008 &quot;Trials of Shazam!&quot; mini-series featured Freddy gaining the powers of Captain Marvel as &quot;Shazam&quot;, while Billy took over for the dead wizard Shazam as &quot;Marvel&quot;.

In current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Freddy Freeman (now a blond teenager instead of the traditional black-haired youth, though still physically disabled) is Billy Batson&#x27;s foster brother, a smart-mouthed pickpocket and trickster whose parents are in prison. He shares Billy&#x27;s secret and by saying &quot;Shazam!&quot; can gain a form similar to an adult version of the traditional Captain Marvel Jr., in a blue uniform.

====Eugene Choi====
Eugene Choi is Billy Batson&#x27;s foster brother, an intelligent, bookish teenager about his age of Asian descent with a love of technology and video games. Eugene&#x27;s bookishness is offset by a competitive and impulsive nature that causes trouble for him and the others at times. Introduced in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries, Eugene can share Billy&#x27;s power by saying &quot;Shazam!&quot; and become an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a silver/gray uniform.

In addition to the standard Shazam power-set, Eugene has the additional power of technopathy, which allows him to manipulate technology.

====Pedro Peña====
Pedro Peña is Billy Batson&#x27;s foster brother, an overweight teenager of Mexican descent who is around Billy&#x27;s age. Introduced in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries, Pedro can share Billy&#x27;s power by saying &quot;Shazam!&quot; and becoming an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a green uniform. Pedro&#x27;s adult form, resembling a tall, bearded powerlifter, is a stark contrast to his personal insecurity and shyness. While the comics have yet to make any such distinction, the 2019 live-action feature film &quot;Shazam!&quot; implies that Pedro is gay or asexual, with him later confirmed to be gay by screenwriter Henry Gayden and also on-screen in &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot;.

In superhuman form, Pedro has extra amounts of super-strength compared to the rest of the Shazam Family, gaining the strength of Hercules.

====Darla Dudley====
Darla Dudley is Billy Batson&#x27;s foster sister, an exuberant African-American preteen who was abandoned by her parents and adopted by Billy&#x27;s foster parents, the Vásquezes. Despite her hardships growing up, Darla is very openly affectionate and loving towards her foster family and virtually anyone she meets. Introduced in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries (as a teenager the same age as the other kids), Darla can share Billy&#x27;s power by saying &quot;Shazam!&quot;

She wears a purple uniform, and her speed abilities are amplified, making her faster than the others. She is also unable to keep secrets, which proved rather difficult to overcome.

===Past members===
====The Lieutenant Marvels====

The Lieutenant Marvels are three other boys named &quot;Billy Batson&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Tall Billy&quot;, &quot;Fat Billy&quot; and &quot;Hill Billy&quot;—the last because he was from the Appalachian Mountains — to differentiate themselves from &quot;Real Billy&quot;, Captain Marvel) who learned that, because they also were named Billy Batson, they could draw on the power of Shazam. They vowed only to use their power if asked by Captain Marvel, and only if all three were to say the magic word, &quot;SHAZAM!&quot; in unison.

They did not appear in Marvel Family stories between &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Flashpoint&quot; in 2011, except for a scene in &quot;The Trials of Shazam!&quot; #2 (2006) where they briefly appeared, only to lose their powers.

Following DC&#x27;s 2011 New 52 reboot, the Lieutenant Marvels appear as non-superpowered allies of the Marvel Family in the 2015 one-shot comic &quot;The Multiversity: Thunderworld&quot;, where they, Mister Tawny, and Uncle Marvel help defeat the Monster Society of Evil while Captain Marvel is fighting Doctor Sivana for control of the Rock of Eternity.

====C.C. Batson &amp; Marilyn Batson====
Clarence Charles &quot;C.C.&quot; Batson (named after Captain Marvel co-creator C. C. Beck) is the biological father of Billy Batson. Billy&#x27;s biological parents had been alluded to in a handful of &quot;Shazam!&quot; stories published prior to 1990 under different names. The 1994 graphic novel &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; by Jerry Ordway introduces C.C. and his wife, Billy&#x27;s mother Marilyn, and how their deaths in that Post-Crisis continuity at the hands of Theo Adam (alter-ego of Black Adam) led to Billy gaining his powers. Much emphasis is made of Captain Marvel/Shazam&#x27;s almost-identical appearance to the deceased C.C. Batson.

In a story arc from the subsequent &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; ongoing series (issues 24–27, 1997), Dr. Sivana sneaks into the timestream outside of the Rock of Eternity and alters the timeline so that Theo Adam never kills the Batsons. Instead, Marilyn and C.C. themselves become the heirs to Shazam&#x27;s power as the Captains Marvel, while Billy and Mary remain typical, upper-middle-class teenagers. C.C. himself is employed by the Wizard Shazam and Waverider to correct the timestream by stopping Sivana from making his changes.

In current &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; continuity, C.C. Batson is still alive, resembling an older Captain Marvel/Shazam with greying hair. As a younger man, C.C. had abandoned Marilyn and Billy when Billy was a toddler and become a grifter. After spending a decade in prison, C.C. returns to Philadelphia to find Billy at the Vazquezes&#x27; foster home. When he is attacked by Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins, Billy shares his Shazam powers with his father, making him the prophesied seventh and final member of the Shazam Family. In superhero form, C.C. Batson wears a yellow/gold costume with red trim (an inverse of the colors of Billy&#x27;s costume).

However, it is revealed that C.C. Batson had been possessed by Mister Mind since his prison release, who intended to uses the Shazam powers in a plot to unite the Seven Magiclands under his rule. Using a spell, Shazam shrinks himself down small enough to enter his father&#x27;s ear canal and battle the worm directly. Following Mind&#x27;s defeat, C.C. loses his powers and is freed from Mind&#x27;s control, but reveals that he has no intentions of reuniting with his son.

===Black Marvel Family members===

The Black Marvel Family, a variant of the Marvel Family concept with Captain Marvel&#x27;s archvillain Black Adam as the central focus, was introduced in &quot;52&quot;.

====Primary members====

=====Black Adam=====

An older Egyptian renegade protégé of the wizard Shazam, who was the first to be granted superpowers by the wizard. Adam eventually grew to abuse his power, and became a tyrant. Shazam returned to punish Adam with either exile into deep space (in the original Fawcett Comics) or death (in the modern DC Comics). He returns to Earth (or life) after Shazam appoints Captain Marvel his new successor, and was soon established as Captain Marvel&#x27;s most powerful foe in physical abilities. In later DC continuity, Black Adam was initially known as Mighty Adam and was empowered by Shu (stamina), Horus (speed), Amon (strength), Zehuti (wisdom), Aton (power), and Mehen (courage). He joined the Justice Society of America, claiming to have reformed, later turning on the Justice Society by using some of its younger associates to help him overthrow the government of his home country, the mythical Kahndaq.

Adam was one of the main characters in &quot;52&quot;, which followed his attempts to establish himself as a hero, which led him to create a &quot;Marvel Family&quot; of his own, which included his superpowered wife Isis and his own &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot;, Osiris.

In the current &quot;New 52&quot; continuity, Black Adam was a former Kahndaqi slave in ancient times who was granted the power of Shazam along with his young nephew, whom he kills for not sharing his taste for vengeance against their enemies. Adam kills the members of Earth&#x27;s Council of Wizards save for the wizard Shazam, who imprisoned him and hid the magic until Adam was freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times.

=====Isis=====

The superheroine Isis was originally created for live-action television to star in &quot;The Secrets of Isis&quot;, a sister series for Filmation&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Shazam!&quot;. Isis teamed up with Captain Marvel on occasion in both television and comics, and briefly starred in a licensed DC comic book in the late 1970s.

In 2006, DC Comics created a new, unrelated Isis and introduced her into the DC Universe. This Isis is the alter-ego of Adrianna Tomaz, originally a slave from Egypt offered to Black Adam by Intergang as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers and kills one of them, Adrianna becomes Adam&#x27;s love interest and made him a more merciful figure, and was granted a special amulet that allowed her to become the avatar of the Egyptian goddess. Adam married Isis, but her death at the hands of the Four Horsemen of Apokolips drove him to a fit of mass murder. At the end of the &quot;Black Adam: The Dark Age&quot; mini-series in 2007, Isis was resurrected by Felix Faust. However, the ordeal of her death, and many months spent as a brainwashed slave, routinely abused by Faust, left her much colder and ruthless than before, making her even less merciful than her husband.

In current &quot;New 52&quot; continuity, Adrianna Tomaz is a peaceful freedom fighter who helps her brother Amon resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.

=====Osiris=====

The teenaged Osiris is Amon Tomaz, Adrianna&#x27;s long-lost brother who was kidnapped, enslaved, and crippled by Intergang. Adam shared his powers with Amon, allowing him to transform into Osiris. Osiris was later murdered by Sobek. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot; and &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Osiris is resurrected as a Black Lantern and later fully resurrected by the Life Entity.

In The New 52 continuity, Amon Tomaz is a rebellious freedom fighter who helps resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.

=====Sobek=====
Sobek is an intelligent humanoid crocodile who was created and abandoned by Sivana and befriends the Black Marvel family after escaping. Despite his monstrous appearance, the character is portrayed as timid, meek, and good-natured, making him the Black Marvel Family&#x27;s analogue to Tawky Tawny. Sobek is later revealed to be Famine, a member of the Four Horsemen. He is killed by Black Adam, but is reincarnated as a humanoid hyena.

During &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Sobek&#x27;s original body is resurrected as a Black Lantern.
=====Bolt=====
Malik White is the modern-day descendant of Black Adam (who initially suggested he take “White Adam” as his superhero name). A medical student based in New York City, he inherited Black Adam&#x27;s ability to summon the lightning and assume the powers of Shazam, taking a white variation of the Black Adam&#x27;s costume. He debuted in &quot;Black Adam&quot; #1 (2022).

====Other members====
* Captain Black Bunny: Predating Black Adam, Captain Black Bunny is the nemesis of Hoppy the Marvel Bunny.
* Black Alice: Able to tap into the power of magical beings, Black Alice tapped into an unknown member of the Marvel Family appearing in a costume similar to Black Adam.
* Black Mary: Losing her powers in the wake of Infinite Crisis, Mary Batson/Bromfield lost her powers from Shazam and gained new ones from Black Adam eventually taking the name Black Mary. During the events of Final Crisis, she became possessed by the New God DeSaad.
* Black Billy: When Black Mary re-emerged to align with Black Adam and Isis, she forced Billy Batson into joining the Black Marvel Family by threatening the life of Stargirl. During this period he became known as Black Billy.
*Mysterious figure: Introduced in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #25 (May 2009), a mysterious figure appears in the Rock of Finality where Black Adam and Isis are imprisoned claiming them as his new champions.
* Black Sivana: In &quot;The Multiversity: Thunderworld Adventures&quot; #1 (February 2015), the Dr. Sivana of Earth 5 found a way to replicate the Marvel Family&#x27;s powers and shared it with his children. Georgia, Magnificus, and Sivana Jr. were able to assume Shazam&#x27;s power by saying &quot;Sivana!&quot; Sivana also applied his discovery to himself as the black-clad Black Sivana. The Dr. Sivana of Earth-S had previously devised a way to steal the power of Shazam for himself and became Captain Sivana.
* Teth-Shazam: Also known as the Captain and Nightmare Captain, Teth-Shazam is created from Mary Marvel&#x27;s nightmares while trapped in the Nightmare Realm of her brother Billy who transforms into a black-clad remorseless killer.

====Other versions====
*On Earth-50, Henry Bendix transformed seventeen year-old Peter Moran into the super-powered Giant. However, his incompetence and temper saw him become a liability and inevitably the super-villain called Halibastard.

==Marvel Family allies==
===Introduced during the Golden Age (1939–1953)===
* The Wizard Shazam – Although he is killed as prophesied after giving Billy the power to become Captain Marvel, Shazam&#x27;s spirit remains as the vigilant caretaker of the Rock of Eternity. When he was originally the Champion, he gained the stamina of Marzosh, speed of Arel, power of Ribalvei, strength of Voldar, courage of Elbiam, and wisdom of Lumian by saying &quot;Vlarem.&quot; His power level varies in different stories from high-level magician to godlike. In the 1990s–2000s continuity, Shazam does not die after granting Billy his powers, and was a much more active character than he was during the Golden Age Marvel Family adventures. Therein, he was part of the Quintessence with Zeus, Ganthet, Highfather, and the Phantom Stranger. In current continuity, Shazam – known to most as only &quot;The Wizard,&quot; whose true name is Mamaragan – was one of the first humans on Earth to wield magic in ancient times, and becomes the head chair of the Council of Eternity. After the betrayal of Black Adam, Shazam&#x27;s compatriots on the council are murdered, and as the remaining member, he imprisons Adam and hides magic from the world. When Adam is freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times, Shazam drafts Billy Batson as his successor.
* Mr. Sterling Morris – The President of Amalgamated Broadcasting, owners of Station WHIZ, the radio (and later TV) station for which Billy Batson works. He debuts in the very first Captain Marvel story in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2.
* Beautia and Magnificus Sivana – Dr. Sivana&#x27;s beautiful adult daughter Beautia shared her father&#x27;s passion for world domination until meeting, and falling for, Captain Marvel. She has an unrequited crush on the shy Captain, not realizing that he is actually only a young boy. Beautia first appeared in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #3b in 1940. Most Golden Age Marvel Family stories feature Beautia as Dr. Sivana&#x27;s unwitting assistant, who betrays her father to assist the heroes. Her older brother Magnificus is also generally depicted as a Marvel Family ally, although in his only Golden Age appearance (&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #15, 1941), Magnificus was super-strong and fought Captain Marvel hand-to-hand at his father&#x27;s request.
* Whitey Murphy - Introduced in the &quot;Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot; (1941), Whitey Murphy become a reoccurring character to Billy Batson in the comics eventually becoming his assistant at WHIZ TV.
* &quot;Muscles&quot; McGinnis – The antagonist of a story included in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #3 (1941), the toughest gangster of the city possessing enormous strength. &quot;Muscles&quot; McGinnis promises to go straight after being defeated by Captain Marvel when he tries to take over Station WHIZ, as he feels the side opposing crime is much stronger. The character was reintroduced as a recurring character in the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series of the 1990s, in which &quot;Muscles&quot; had indeed reformed to become an undercover cop and a frequent ally of Captain Marvel.
* Bulletman and Bulletgirl - Fawcett&#x27;s second most prominent hero team, Bulletman and Bulletgirl (later joined by Bulletdog and Bulletboy for a Bullet Family with an evil Bullet Family in Bulletthug and Bulletmoll) started to cross paths with the Marvel Family in &quot;Master Comics&quot; #21 (December 1941) when Bulletman and Captain Marvel aligned to battle Captain Nazi.
* Steamboat – In the 1940s Fawcett stories, Steamboat is Billy Batson&#x27;s African-American valet. Depicted as cowardly and subservient, Steamboat accompanied Billy and Captain Marvel on many of their adventures following his first appearance in &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Comics&quot; #3 in 1941. Drawn in a racially stereotyped manner and speaking with a stereotypical Negro dialect, Steamboat was retired from the Captain Marvel stories after the Youth Builders, a diverse group of New York City and Philadelphia area students, protested the use of the character in 1945. At one time under the control of hypnosis, Steamboat donned a costume similar to Captain Marvel and operated as &quot;Captin Mahvel.&quot;
* Professor Edgewise - Introduced in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #9 (April 1942), Professor Edgewise is a brilliant scientist whose inventions tend to create problems that the Marvel Family need to resolve.
* Cissie Sommerly – Billy Batson&#x27;s girlfriend and Sterling Morris&#x27; niece. She first appears in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #12 (1942). Billy immediately fell in love with her at first sight, soon growing close to each other; she had a very positive and cheerful personality, and sang certain words when talking to Billy in her first appearances in the original comics. Her last name was originally spelled Summerly before they changed it replacing the U with an O, and she also had a brother named Pete. She didn&#x27;t have a full status role in Billy&#x27;s life, only recurring; but whenever she and Billy got together, they always cared about each other deeply&#x27; and whenever they encountered danger, Billy would secretly transform into Captain Marvel and save her. After she and all the other Fawcett characters were acquired by DC, She spent some more time with Billy going to the local burger store and such for the first couple of years before she was forgotten about, and years before the Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline. She hasn&#x27;t reappeared since unfortunately.
* Crime Crusaders Club - A group of heroes made up of Captain Marvel Jr., Bulletman, Bulletgirl, and Minute Man in &quot;Master Comics&quot; #41 (August 1943).
* Uncle Marvel (Uncle Dudley) – During the Golden Age, an old man named Dudley claimed that he was not only a relative of the Marvels but also a Marvel himself, although neither was true. Regardless, the Marvels took a liking to him and decided to humor his pretense, and &quot;Uncle&quot; Dudley became Uncle Marvel, the Marvel Family&#x27;s manager. He would make his &quot;transformation&quot; along with one or more of the others, but not by magic; rather, by quickly removing his break-away garments (under the cover of lightning that the real Marvel(s) called down) to reveal his homemade Marvel costume underneath. He explained his lack of superpowers by claiming he suffered from &quot;shazambago&quot;. Dudley first appeared in &quot;Wow Comics&quot; #18 in 1943. In the 1990s &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; comics, Dudley H. Dudley is simply a janitor at Billy&#x27;s school who finds himself involved in the Marvel Family&#x27;s adventures, although in one story (&quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; #11, 1996) he was temporarily given superpowers by Shazam&#x27;s ally Ibis the Invincible to help round up the escaped Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]

==Marvel Family enemies==
===Key villains===
Besides the Black Marvel Family, the following are among the most prominent members of the Marvel Family&#x27;s rogues gallery, in order of first appearance in the comics:

====Doctor Sivana====

Dr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana Sr. – &quot;The World&#x27;s Wickedest Scientist&quot; – debuted in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 alongside Billy Batson and Captain Marvel, quickly becoming his main archenemy and most frequently recurring villain. A mad scientist who fights the Marvel Family using his genius intellect and inventions, the Golden Age Sivana had been a humanitarian scientist who bitterly fled 20th-century Europe after his inventions were ridiculed by the scientific society. Living on Venus with his four children, he became a mad scientist, bent on taking over the universe.

Other versions of Sivana in later DC Comics have positioned him as Billy Batson&#x27;s wicked step-uncle (&quot;Shazam!: The New Beginning&quot;), a wealthy, wicked businessman driven to ruin by his entanglements with Black Adam (&quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot;), and the wicked Attorney General of the United States (&quot;Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil&quot;). The current-continuity Doctor Sivana, following the 2011 reboot, is a rich scientist determined to prove the existence of magic, which leads him to free both Black Adam and Mister Mind. Sivana acquires the ability to both see magic and project magic lightning from his right eye.

During the early and mid-1940s, Dr. Sivana was often assisted, under duress, by his good-natured adult daughter Beautia (and, briefly, Sivana&#x27;s oldest child, his son Magnificus). From the mid-1940s onward, his youngest children – teenaged twins Thaddeus Jr. aka Sivana Jr, and Georgia Sivana, both dead ringers for their father – became his henchmen as the Sivana Family. Georgia Sivana became a prominent villain for Mary Marvel, as did Sivana Jr. for Captain Marvel Jr. Over the years, Sivana has managed to gain the power of Shazam for himself. Once as Captain Sivana in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; Annual #3 (September 1984) and later as Black Sivana in &quot;The Multiversity: Thunderworld Adventures&quot; #1 (February 2015). For the latter, Magnificus, Sivana Jr., and Georgia Sivana also stole the power.

====Captain Nazi====

Introduced in a three-part crossover between &quot;Master Comics&quot; and &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; in 1941 during World War II, Captain Nazi – real name Albrecht Krieger – is a genetically altered Nazi who is Adolf Hitler&#x27;s champion. Wearing a green costume with a swastika insignia, Captain Nazi has super-strength, near-invulnerability, and can use a special chemical gas to fly.

Created to wreak havoc on America, Captain Nazi murders an elderly man and cripples a teenage boy during his fight with Captain Marvel in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #25 (December 1941). The boy, Freddy Freeman, is granted powers by Captain Marvel to save his life, becoming Captain Marvel Jr. and declaring Captain Nazi his mortal enemy.

====Ibac====

A frail thug named &quot;Stinky&quot; Printwhistle who was empowered by Lucifer himself after Lucifer saved Printwhistle from a fall caused by Captain Marvel. Printwistle is imbued with the powers of four of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth (Ivan the Terrible, Borgia, Attila the Hun and Caligula). When he says the name &quot;IBAC&quot;, he is engulfed in green fire and brimstone and becomes a large, muscular brute with super-strength. Saying his name again transforms him back into Printwhistle (therefore, like Captain Marvel Jr., Ibac also cannot say his own name).

Ibac first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #8 in 1942 and became a recurring Marvel Family villain through the characters&#x27; run in Fawcett and DC Comics. The 2011 rebooted version of Ibac is the descendant of a long line of evil despots, the first of whom – Ibac the Terrible – was known in ancient times as &quot;the man who invented evil.&quot;

====Satan====
Having granted power to Ibac and Sabbac, Satan (initially under the name of Prince Lucifer) came into direct conflict with the Marvel Family years later including when he came to collect on the soul of Ebenezer Batson. Billy Batson, Ebenezer&#x27;s nephew, battled Satan&#x27;s champions Abaddon, Medea, Antaeus, Old Age, Legion, and Truth as Captain Marvel. Defeated, Satan returned with the Confederation of Hell including the aforementioned Ibac and Sabbac as well as Master Man and Darkling in an unsuccessful bid to eliminate the Marvel Family and Kid Eternity.

====Sabbac====

Similar to Ibac, Timothy Karnes is granted the powers of six demons when he says the magic word &quot;Sabbac&quot;. As opposed to fire, Sabbac transforms via black lightning cast up (rather than down) from Hades. First appearing in &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot; #4 (February 1943), Sabbac&#x27;s pantheon grant him powers similar to the Marvel Family, with the added power of pyrokenesis.

A second Sabbac, Ishamel Gregor, was introduced in the mid-2000s in the &quot;Outsiders&quot; comic book. While Karnes&#x27; Sabbac became a more muscular version of himself in a green cloak with demon fangs, Gregor&#x27;s Sabbac is a large, muscular, horned demon with red skin and hair.

In the 2011 &quot;Shazam!&quot; reboot, the Seven Deadly Sins have the power to possess a wicked human and transform him into a fifty-foot tall demon resembling the Ishamel Gregor version of Sabbac.

====Mister Mind====

First appearing in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #22 (1943) as a disembodied voice, and later in issue #26 in his actual form, Mister Mind – &quot;The World&#x27;s Wickedest Worm&quot; – is an evil alien caterpillar with genius intellect. Given his small stature, he wears a talkbox to communicate and is often depicted wearing eyeglasses as well. He runs the supervillain team called the Monster Society of Evil Mister Mind&#x27;s own powers have included mind control (typically by crawling into a host&#x27;s ear), telepathy, mental projection, and, once evolved into a &quot;Hyperfly&quot;, the ability to eat time itself.

The 2011 reboot of Mister (Maxivermis) Mind presents him as a native of one of the Seven Magiclands (The Monsterlands according to Mind, The Wildlands according to rumor) who gained high-level magic powers by reading every book in the Rock of Eternity&#x27;s library.

====Crocodile-Men====
The Crocodile-Men (also called &quot;Punkusians&quot;) are a race of humanoid crocodiles from the planetoid Punkus who were members of the Monster Society of Evil in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; during the mid-1940s. There were many unnamed Crocodile-Men who just acted as henchmen for Mister Mind. One of them was one of Mister Mind&#x27;s Monster Professors while the others were Monster Students.

* Herkimer – A Crocodile-Man in a business suit who is Mister Mind&#x27;s second-in-command. Between the end of the Fawcett Marvel Family run in 1953 and the start of the DC &quot;Shazam!&quot; run in 1972, Herkimer reforms and gets a job as part of a carnival. In the third volume&#x27;s special interlude issue that takes place before the first issue, Herkimer attacks a museum stating that the reign of the Crocodile-Men is nigh. He was mentioned to have fought Shazam before. When Freddy asks why Herkimer is in a business suit, Billy states that he didn&#x27;t say. Herkimer is defeated by Shazam. Billy later mentioned his fight with him to Batman following Shazam&#x27;s disastrous fight with Scarecrow where Batman mentions that he has fought Killer Croc many times. Batman does answer &quot;No&quot; when asked by Billy if he wears a business suit.
** Herkimer appears in &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot; episode &quot;The Circus Plot&quot;, voiced by Alan Oppenheimer.
* Jorrk – The greatest scientist of the Crocodile-Men and one of Mister Mind&#x27;s three lieutenants.
* Sylvester – A Crocodile-Man and one of Mister Mind&#x27;s preferred gunners.

The third volume of the &quot;Shazam!&quot; comic book series, launched in 2018, introduced an unnamed three-headed Crocodile-Man in striped prison attire from the Wildlands who is a member of the Monster Society of Evil.

====Oggar====

A wizard who is the &quot;World&#x27;s Mightiest Immortal.&quot; Oggar was originally part of the Shazam pantheon before the Wizard, then known as &quot;Shazamo&quot;, dismissed him. Seeking revenge, Oggar uses his extensive magic powers to battle Shazam and his champions, though his powers cannot directly harm women and girls, allowing Mary to battle him directly. First appearing in a multi-issue arc starting with &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #61 in 1946, Oggar recurred regularly in &quot;Shazam!&quot; stories during the 1970s and 1980s.

====King Kull====

The king of the Beast Men (also called the Submen), Neanderthal-like humanoids who ruled the earth in ancient times and enslaved the &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Kull fakes his death and goes into suspended animation, awakening in the modern-day and attempt to take over or destroy the world again. He possesses super-strength, near-invulnerability, and expert weaponry and military skills. Kull first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #125 in 1951.

====Blaze and Satanus====

Originally introduced in the early 1990s as Superman villains, Blaze and Satanus are powerful twin demons who are among the rules of Hades. They are also the estranged children of the Wizard Shazam, from his younger days as the ancient Canaanite superhero Vlarem The Champion. While Satanus has a soft-spot for his father and assists him from time-to-time (including giving life to Tawky Tawny), Blaze hates the Wizard and stages attacks on both him and the Marvel Family, believing the power of Shazam to be her birthright.

Although evil, Banjo would go up against Captain Marvel with nothing more than a banjo. He first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #8, in the same issue as – though in a different story than – Ibac.
* Aunt Minerva – A criminal mastermind who looks like a sweet old lady, but has deadly accuracy with a gun and a desire to find a new husband after her first five died.

The demons, whose forms vary by era and artist, sometimes escape and cause havoc through murder and using their powers to influence sin in humans.

Based upon the seven deadly sins as enumerated in the Christian faith, the original &quot;Seven Deadly Enemies of Man&quot; were slightly censored for suitable reading for children: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice. Each demon could influence their namesake sin in human victims.

<doc id="1160631" wikidata="Q1227488" url="?curid=1160631" title="Direct Rendering Infrastructure">
<text>The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) is the framework comprising the modern Linux graphics stack which allows unprivileged user-space programs to issue commands to graphics hardware without conflicting with other programs. The main use of DRI is to provide hardware acceleration for the Mesa implementation of OpenGL. DRI has also been adapted to provide OpenGL acceleration on a framebuffer console without a display server running.

DRI implementation is scattered through the X Server and its associated client libraries, Mesa 3D and the Direct Rendering Manager kernel subsystem. All of its source code is open-source software.

== Overview ==
In the classic X Window System architecture the X Server is the only process with exclusive access to the graphics hardware, and therefore the one which does the actual rendering on the framebuffer. All that X clients do is communicate with the X Server to dispatch rendering commands. Those commands are hardware independent, meaning that the X11 protocol provides an API that abstracts the graphics device so the X clients don&#x27;t need to know or worry about the specifics of the underlying hardware. Any hardware-specific code lives inside the Device Dependent X, the part of the X Server that manages each type of video card or graphics adapter and which is also often called the &quot;video&quot; or &quot;graphics driver&quot;.

The rise of 3D rendering has shown the limits of this architecture. 3D graphics applications tend to produce large amounts of commands and data, all of which must be dispatched to the X Server for rendering. As the amount of inter-process communication (IPC) between the X client and X Server increased, the 3D rendering performance suffered to the point that X driver developers concluded that in order to take advantage of 3D hardware capabilities of the latest graphics cards a new IPC-less architecture was required. X clients should have direct access to graphics hardware rather than relying on another process to do so, saving all the IPC overhead. This approach is called &quot;direct rendering&quot; as opposed to the &quot;indirect rendering&quot; provided by the classical X architecture. The &quot;Direct Rendering Infrastructure&quot; was initially developed to allow any X client to perform 3D rendering using this &quot;direct rendering&quot; approach.

Nothing prevents DRI from being used to implement accelerated 2D direct rendering within an X client. Simply no one has had the need to do so because the 2D indirect rendering performance was good enough.

== Software architecture ==
The basic architecture of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure involves three main components:
* the DRI client —for example, an X client performing &quot;direct rendering&quot;— needs a hardware-specific &quot;driver&quot; able to manage the current video card or graphics adapter in order to render on it. These &quot;DRI drivers&quot; are typically provided as shared libraries to which the client is dynamically linked. Since DRI was conceived to take advantage of 3D graphics hardware, the libraries are normally presented to clients as hardware-accelerated implementations of a 3D API such as OpenGL, provided by either the 3D-hardware vendor itself or a third party such as the Mesa 3D free software project.
* the X Server provides an X11 protocol extension —the DRI extension— that the DRI clients use to coordinate with both the windowing system and the DDX driver. As part of the DDX driver, it&#x27;s quite common that the X Server process also dynamically links to the same DRI driver that the DRI clients do, but to provide hardware-accelerated 3D rendering to the X clients using the GLX extension for indirect rendering (for example, remote X clients that can&#x27;t use direct rendering). For 2D rendering, the DDX driver must also take into account the DRI clients using the same graphics device.
* the access to the video card or graphics adapter is regulated by a kernel component called the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM). Both the X Server&#x27;s DDX driver and each X client&#x27;s DRI driver must use DRM to access the graphics hardware. DRM provides synchronization to the shared resources of the graphics hardware —resources such as the command queue, the card registers, the video memory, the DMA engines, ...— ensuring that the concurrent access of all those multiple competing user-space processes don&#x27;t interfere with each other. DRM also serves as a basic security enforcer that doesn&#x27;t allow any X client to access the hardware beyond what it needs to perform the 3D rendering.

== DRI1 ==
In the original DRI architecture, due to the memory size of video cards at that time, there was a single instance of the screen front buffer and back buffer (also of the ancillary depth buffer and stencil buffer), shared by all the DRI clients and the X Server. All of them rendered directly onto the back buffer, that was swapped with the front buffer at vertical blanking interval time. In order to render to the back buffer, a DRI process should ensure that the rendering was clipped to the area reserved for its window.

The synchronization with the X Server was done through signals and a shared memory buffer called the SAREA. The access to the DRM device was exclusive, so any DRI client had to lock it at the beginning of a rendering operation. Other users of the device —including the X Server— were blocked in the meantime, and they had to wait until the lock was released at the end of the current rendering operation, even if it wouldn&#x27;t be any conflict between both operations. Another drawback was that operations didn&#x27;t retain memory allocations after the current DRI process released its lock on the device, so any data uploaded to the graphics memory such as textures were lost for upcoming operations, causing a significant impact on graphics performance.

Nowadays DRI1 is considered completely obsolete and must not be used.

== DRI2 ==
Due to the increasing popularity of compositing window managers like Compiz, the Direct Rendering Infrastructure had to be redesigned so that X clients could also support redirection to &quot;offscreen pixmaps&quot; while doing direct rendering. Regular X clients already respected the redirection to a separate pixmap provided by the X Server as a render target —the so-called offscreen pixmap—, but DRI clients continued to do the rendering directly into the shared backbuffer, effectively bypassing the compositing window manager. The ultimate solution was to change the way DRI handled the render buffers, which led to a completely different DRI extension with a new set of operations, and also major changes in the Direct Rendering Manager. The new extension was named &quot;DRI2&quot;, although it&#x27;s not a later version but a different extension not even compatible with the original DRI —in fact both have coexisted within the X Server for a long time.

In DRI2, instead of a single shared (back) buffer, every DRI client gets its own private back buffer —along with their associated depth and stencil buffers— to render its window content using the hardware acceleration. The DRI client then swaps it with a false &quot;front buffer&quot;, which is used by the compositing window manager as one of the sources to compose (build) the final screen back buffer to be swapped at the VBLANK interval with the real front buffer.

To handle all these new buffers, the Direct Rendering Manager had to incorporate new functionality, specifically a graphics memory manager. DRI2 was initially developed using the experimental TTM memory manager, but it was later rewritten to use GEM after it was chosen as the definitive DRM memory manager. The new DRI2 internal buffer management model also solved two major performance bottlenecks present in the original DRI implementation:

* DRI2 clients no longer lock the entire DRM device while using it for rendering, since now each client gets a separate render buffer independent from the other processes.
* DRI2 clients can allocate their own buffers (with textures, vertex lists, ...) in the video memory and keep them as long as they want, which significantly reduces video memory bandwidth consumption.

In DRI2, the allocation of the private offscreen buffers (back buffer, fake front buffer, depth buffer, stencil buffer, ...) for a window is done by the X Server itself. DRI clients retrieve those buffers to do the rendering into the window by calling operations such as and available in the DRI2 extension. Internally, DRI2 uses &quot;GEM names&quot; —a type of global handle provided by the GEM API that allows two processes accessing a DRM device to refer to the same buffer— for passing around &quot;references&quot; to those buffers through the X11 protocol. The reason why the X Server is in charge of the buffer allocation of the render buffers of a window is that the GLX extension allows for multiple X clients to do OpenGL rendering cooperatively in the same window. This way, the X Server manages the whole lifecycle of the render buffers along the entire rendering process and knows when it can safely recycle or discard them. When a window resize is performed, the X Server is also responsible for allocating new render buffers matching the new window size, and notifying the change to the DRI client(s) rendering into the window using an InvalidateBuffers event, so they would retrieve the GEM names of the new buffers.

The DRI2 extension provides other core operations for the DRI clients, such as finding out which DRM device and driver they should use () or getting authenticated by the X Server in order to be able to use the rendering and buffer facilities of the DRM device (). The presentation of the rendered buffers in the screen is performed using the and requests. can be used to do a copy between the fake front buffer and the real front buffer, but it doesn&#x27;t provide any synchronization with the vertical blanking interval, so it can cause &quot;tearing&quot;. , on the other hand, performs a VBLANK-synchronized swap between back and front buffer, if it&#x27;s supported and both buffers have the same size, or a copy (blit) otherwise.

== DRI3 ==
Although DRI2 was a significant improvement over the original DRI, the new extension also introduced some new issues. In 2013, a third iteration of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure known as DRI3 was developed in order to fix those issues.

The main differences of DRI3 compared to DRI2 are:

* DRI3 clients allocate their render buffers, instead of relying on the X Server for doing the allocation, which was the method supported by DRI2.
* DRI3 gets rid of the old insecure GEM buffer sharing mechanism based on &quot;GEM names&quot; (global GEM handles) for passing buffer objects between a DRI client and the X Server in favor of the one more secure and versatile based on PRIME DMA-BUFs, which uses file descriptors instead.

Buffer allocation on the client side breaks GLX assumptions in the sense that it&#x27;s no longer possible for multiple GLX applications to render cooperatively in the same window. On the plus side, the fact that the DRI client is in charge of its own buffers throughout their lifetime brings many advantages. For example, it is easy for the DRI3 client to ensure that the size of the render buffers always match the current size of the window, and thereby eliminate the artifacts due to the lack of synchronization of buffer sizes between client and server that plagued window resizing in DRI2. A better performance is also achieved because now DRI3 clients save the extra round trip waiting for the X Server to send the render buffers. DRI3 clients, and especially compositor window managers, can take advantage of keeping older buffers of previous frames and reusing them as the basis on which to render only the damaged parts of a window as another performance optimization. The DRI3 extension no longer needs to be modified to support new particular buffer formats, since they are now handled directly between the DRI client driver and the DRM kernel driver. The use of file descriptors, on the other hand, allows the kernel to perform a safe cleanup of any unused GEM buffer object —one with no reference to it.

Technically, DRI3 consists of two different extensions, the &quot;DRI3&quot; extension and the &quot;Present&quot; extension. The main purpose of the DRI3 extension is to implement the mechanism to share direct rendered buffers between DRI clients and the X Server. DRI clients allocate and use GEM buffers objects as rendering targets, while the X Server represents these render buffers using a type of X11 object called &quot;pixmap&quot;. DRI3 provides two operations, and , one to create a pixmap (in &quot;X Server space&quot;) from a GEM buffer object (in &quot;DRI client space&quot;), and the other to do the reverse and get a GEM buffer object from an X pixmap. In these DRI3 operations GEM buffer objects are passed as DMA-BUF file descriptors instead of GEM names. DRI3 also provides a way to share synchronization objects between the DRI client and the X Server, allowing both a serialized access to the shared buffer. Unlike DRI2, the initial operation —the first every DRI client must request to know which DRM device to use— returns an already open file descriptor to the device node instead of the device node filename, with any required authentication procedure already performed in advance by the X Server.

DRI3 provides no mechanism to show the rendered buffers on the screen, but relies on another extension, the &quot;Present&quot; extension, to do so. &quot;Present&quot; is so named because its main task is to &quot;present&quot; buffers on the screen, meaning that it handles the update of the framebuffer using the contents of the rendered buffers delivered by client applications. Screen updates have to be done at the proper time, normally during the VBLANK interval in order to avoid display artifacts such as &quot;tearing&quot;. Present also handles the synchronization of screen updates to the VBLANK interval. It also keeps the X client informed about the instant each buffer is really shown on the screen using events, so the client can synchronize its rendering process with the current screen refresh rate.

Present accepts any X pixmap as the source for a screen update. Since pixmaps are standard X objects, Present can be used not only by DRI3 clients performing direct rendering, but also by any X client rendering on a pixmap by any means. For example, most existing non-GL based GTK+ and Qt applications used to do double buffered pixmap rendering using XRender. The Present extension can also be used by these applications to achieve efficient and non-tearing screen updates. This is the reason why Present was developed as a separate standalone extension instead of being part of DRI3.

Apart from allowing non-GL X clients to synchronize with VBLANK, Present brings other advantages. DRI3 graphics performance is better because Present is more efficient than DRI2 in swapping buffers. A number of OpenGL extensions that weren&#x27;t available with DRI2 are now supported based on new features provided by Present.

Present provides two main operations to X clients: update a region of a window using part of or all the contents of a pixmap () and set the type of presentation events related to a certain window that the client wants to be notified about (). There are three presentation events about which a window can notify an X client: when an ongoing presentation operation —normally from a call to — has been completed (), when a pixmap used by a operation is ready to be reused () and when the window configuration —mostly window size— changes (). Whether a operation performs a direct copy (blit) onto the front buffer or a swap of the entire back buffer with the front buffer is an internal detail of the Present extension implementation, instead of an explicit choice of the X client as it was in DRI2.

== Adoption ==

Several open source DRI drivers have been written, including ones for ATI Mach64, ATI Rage128, ATI Radeon, 3dfx Voodoo3 through Voodoo5, Matrox G200 through G400, SiS 300-series, Intel i810 through i965, S3 Savage, VIA UniChrome graphics chipsets, and nouveau for Nvidia. Some graphics vendors have written closed-source DRI drivers, including ATI and PowerVR Kyro.

The various versions of DRI have been implemented by various operating systems, amongst others by the Linux kernel, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and OpenSolaris.

== History ==
The project was started by Jens Owen and Kevin E. Martin from Precision Insight (funded by Silicon Graphics and Red Hat). It was first made widely available as part of XFree86 4.0 and is now part of the X.Org Server. It is currently maintained by the free software community.

Work on DRI2 started at the 2007 X Developers&#x27; Summit from a proposal by Kristian Høgsberg. Høgsberg himself wrote the new DRI2 extension and the modifications to Mesa and GLX. In March 2008 DRI2 was mostly done, but it couldn&#x27;t make into X.Org Server version 1.5 and had to wait until version 1.6 from February 2009. The DRI2 extension was officially included in the X11R7.5 release of October 2009. The first public version of the DRI2 protocol (2.0) was announced in April 2009. Since then there have been several revisions, the most recent being version 2.8 from July 2012.

Due to several limitations of DRI2, a new extension called DRI-Next was proposed by Keith Packard and Emma Anholt at the X.Org Developer&#x27;s Conference 2012. The extension was proposed again as DRI3000 at Linux.conf.au 2013. DRI3 and Present extensions were developed during 2013 and merged into the X.Org Server 1.15 release from December 2013. The first and only version of the DRI3 protocol (1.0) was released in November 2013.

<text>The Churnet Valley Railway is a preserved standard gauge heritage railway in the Staffordshire Moorlands of Staffordshire, England. It operates along part of the former Churnet Valley Line which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1849. 
The line is roughly long from Kingsley &amp; Froghall to Ipstones. The land from Leek Brook Junction to Ipstones was opened by Moorland &amp; City Railways (MCR) in 2010 after they took a lease out from Network Rail. This has subsequently been purchased by the Churnet Valley Railway. The main stations along the line are Kingsley and Froghall, Consall, Cheddleton and Leek Brook (which is only used as a run around loop). 

An extension to the town of Leek which will act as the northern terminus of the CVR was completed in late 2024. The line between Leek and Waterhouses has also been reopened as part of the heritage railway, currently as far as Ipstones.

== Preservation history ==

=== Early days of preservation: Cheddleton station (1964–1977) ===

The &quot;&#x27;Cheshire and Staffordshire Railway Society&quot; (C&amp;SRS) was formed in the 1970s by Ken Simpson and others to try to save some of the lines built by the old NSR, which first began to close in 1964. Their original target was the Biddulph Valley route which branched north from the Stoke-Leek line at Milton Junction, and headed north to Biddulph Wharf and Congleton, but Cheshire County Council showed only lukewarm interest. Leek station was also considered for a heritage line north of Rudyard Lake but was demolished in 1973. The society then aimed to re-open the Oakamoor to Alton Towers section, using the former Oakamoor tunnel for stock storage.

The council intended to demolish the station at Cheddleton in April 1974, but local businessman and parish councillor Norman Hancock parked his car on the level crossing in front of the bulldozers, preventing the demolition. This delay allowed the building to be Grade II listed on 14 May 1974 after a campaign by the C&amp;SRS, Sir John Betjeman and the Victorian Society. In 1976 the former station building was let to the C&amp;SRS to use as a museum.

The C&amp;SRS became the North Staffordshire Railway Society (NSRS), Cheddleton station became Cheddleton Railway Centre, and the Churnet Valley Railway in effect began. The plans for the Oakamoor to Alton Towers track were put on hold, the old siding and goods yard at Cheddleton was purchased, and workshops were created with the first locomotives arriving in 1977. British Rail (BR) was at the time still using the adjacent railway to move industrial sand from the quarry at Oakamoor. This all resulted in the unusual sight of a Fowler tender being delivered to the NSRS at the rear of a sand train, arriving from Bescot, being uncoupled, and then left for the NSRS volunteers to crane over from the mainline into the NSRS yard before the sand train returned.

=== Developments to first running: track bed acquisition (1978–1996) ===
In 1978 the NSRS became the &quot;North Staffordshire Railway Co. (1978) Ltd&quot;, which gained charity status in 1983. The bay platform area at Cheddleton was acquired in 1984 and the former NSR signal box from Clifton was put into use at the site, allowing demonstration runs to operate around the former goods yard. A commemorative plaque at the restored station acknowledges Norman Hancock and his role in ensuring the survival of the Jacobean-style building.

British Rail ceased using the remains of the former Churnet Valley Line in 1988, and the NSRC sought to purchase the stretch from Oakamoor to Leek Brook Junction. In 1992, the charity NSRC incorporated a subsidiary company: &quot;&#x27;Churnet Valley Railway&quot; (1992) plc. In 1996, the company was granted a Light Railway Order to run between Leek Brook Junction to Oakamoor Sand Sidings. (This was the last such order before the implementation of a new legal framework in the Transport and Works Act.) The company was also responsible for applications for planning permission and other legal necessities. The first public share issue was launched in 1995, to fund the purchase of the land and track, following an agreement with the British Railways Board. Share Issue 1 was well supported, particularly by the local community, and raised over £120,000. The purchase was completed on 4 July 1996. The trading activities of the NSRC were subsequently transferred to the CVR following this initial success.

The track was then made ready for passenger trains, and on 24 August 1996 LMS Fowler Class 3F 47383 departed Cheddleton for Leek Brook Junction, a distance of roughly .

=== New stations: Consall and Kingsley &amp; Froghall (1998–2003) ===

Share issue 2 in 1998 aimed to raise £160,000 to upgrade the line south from Cheddleton to Consall for passenger services, which was successfully achieved on 11 July 1998.

Shortly after this, the next section south to Kingsley &amp; Froghall station was rehabilitated to provide an alternative to Cheddleton for visitors&#x27; car parking, and thus allow the business to expand. The third share issue was launched in the summer of 2000 in order to raise £185,000, and on 14 October 2000 &quot;top and tailed&quot; diesel-hauled passenger specials ran. Floods in November 2000 damaged at least three sections along the extension, but by 11 August 2001 the section of line was restored sufficiently to allow CVR&#x27;s passenger regular operations to extend over the line to Kingsley &amp; Froghall, and on 19 July 2003 Kingsley &amp; Froghall&#x27;s re-constructed station building was opened by Pete Waterman.

=== Upgrades and extension (2008–2011) ===

This single platform at Kingsley &amp; Froghall station was supplemented by the restoration of the second platform in 2008 using grant money. The wooden waiting shelter was re-built to the original 1849 design and incorporated the original brick foundations. A new foot crossing at the south of the platform (there never was a footbridge) replaced a previous foot crossing at the north end. The restoration project jointly won &quot;The National Express East Coast Volunteers Award&quot; at the National Railway Heritage Awards 2008.

In 2010, the of track from Leek Brook Junction to Cauldon Lowe was restored to passenger-carrying standards, allowing services to run by November. The signal box at Leek Brook Junction was restored externally, and the platform and surrounding area were cleared of vegetation. Planning permission for full restoration of the site was granted in November 2011.

== Route of the CVR ==

Most CVR passenger trains run between Kingsley &amp; Froghall station in Froghall village (Kingsley is a further away) and Ipstones loop via the intermediate stations at Consall, Cheddleton and Leek Brook junction. 

== Stations ==

Passengers may join the railway at only four stations: Leek Brook, Cheddleton, Consall and Kingsley and Froghall. Cheddleton is the operational headquarters and site of the motive power depot, engine shed and the carriage and wagon restoration workshops. The original Victorian station building houses the North Staffordshire Railway museum. There is also a refreshment room and booking office. Consall is a small rural station with Victorian buildings and waiting room. There is also a passing loop. There is a run-round loop of track and a watering column.

The CVR&#x27;s station at Leek Brook is in passenger use, but there is no access to the platform other than the railway.

Given the various nearby former railway tracks, the CVR has various plans for expansion. Extension north to Leek is the current priority, where a platform has been granted outline planning permission. Works are ongoing to relay track to a site half a mile from the historic site of leek station.

== Future extensions ==
=== Northwards – Leek ===
Also see &quot;Leek (Churnet Valley) railway station&quot; about the future of the proposed station.

It has always been the CVR long-term aim to re-open the line back into the market town of Leek, and after the Froghall extension of 2001 the railway made it clear that the extension into Leek was the next priority in terms of physical expansion.

The CVR have taken on the Leek project themselves, and after much dialogue with the council received outline planning permission for their own proposal in May 2018. They then launched their own project publicly on 1 February 2020. The Railway received a £1.4 million grant from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, and as of the 25 August 2023 have reinstated a rail triangle (only the second in preservation in the UK after Norton Fitzwarren on the West Somerset Railway).

A separate company was proposing redevelopments of the Barnfields estate in Leek, which is the mooted location for the new station. These plans were given Outline Planning Permission in December 2014, and include the construction of a new platform for the railway, new Marina connecting into the Leek branch of the Caldon Canal as well as a new restaurant and potentially a dedicated North Staffordshire Museum.

In late 2024, track laying was largely completed towards Leek, with the first passenger service to the site of the new Leek station planned to run in early 2025 On 31 December 2024, a train operated by Churnet Valley Railway travelled for the first time from Froghall to the new temporary terminus at Leek, carrying 400 invited guests.

=== Southwards ===
To the south, from Froghall, the line is under the ownership of the CVR as far as the former sand sidings at Oakamoor even though as of 2024 the trackwork has been lifted. After this the line crossed over the River Churnet straight into a tunnel before Oakamoor station is reached. The track to the sidings requires upgrading for passenger use, and work on the tunnel and the rebuilding of the station site would be necessary to extend further than the former quarry, although it is considered viable. Whilst the railway owns the track as far as the sand sidings, the bridge, tunnel and trackbed beyond this is in the hands of Staffordshire County Council.

A new station platform called &quot;Moneystone&quot; (name of the former quarry) has been mooted at the site of the former sand sidings by the CVR to connect to a new Holiday Camp that has been proposed for the former quarry itself

Further south is Oakamoor itself, and then onto Alton Towers, where the station building has been restored although it is owned by the Landmark Trust. The prospect of running trains as far as Alton is potentially lucrative given the tourist potential provided by the popular Alton Towers which is located nearby. This is something of a long-term prospect, however, especially as this section of track now forms part of the National Cycle Network &quot;National Route 54&quot;.

This section (from Froghall-Alton Towers) is in principle regarded as commercially viable to reopen, and has been stated as a longer-term expansion aim of Moorland &amp; City Railways.

The next station on the route south of Alton is Denstone, and the trackbed is clear of as far as the former platforms then a house has encroached on the former level crossing making expansion beyond Denstone back towards the mainline at Uttoxeter improbable without significant financial outlay.

=== Westwards ===
West of Leek Brook Junction is the Stoke–Leek line. The line is part of the planned Moorland &amp; City network (see separate section) and is mothballed by Network Rail pending work to return it to a usable condition. As the Churnet Valley Railway has certain running rights on the Moorland &amp; City network, it is feasible that heritage steam trains could use the line once more.

Any possible extension towards Stoke-on-Trent railway station could see the Churnet Valley Railway interchange with commuter rail services on the West Coast Main Line once time, money and finances allow.

In January 2012 the CVR publicly announced they were involved in the restoration of the from Leek Brook Junction to Endon Station in collaboration with Moorlands &amp; City Railways. In 2011 vegetation was cleared on the section to allow a comprehensive survey of the track to be undertaken, and in 2012 extensive sleeper replacement began in order to bring the route up to passenger carrying standards. This was being completed by Churnet Valley Railway volunteers, in partnership with Moorland &amp; City Railways, and supported by contractors where necessary.

Work stopped when a local resident made a village green application for the track bed, claiming that the line had become a village green through its lack of use as a railway for a number of years and that many locals used it as a footpath already. This was eventually rejected by Staffordshire County Council, as none of the criteria for village green status were met. Meanwhile, negotiations continued between MCR (plus CVR) and Network Rail to instate a heritage service on a restricted number of dates to Endon. In early 2013 it was announced that the CVR would be looking to take a tenancy out on part of the former station building to open a tea room, in order to create a presence within the village and signal its commitment to returning trains to the station. This tea room was subsequently opened on 13 January 2015 by a local couple and named &#x27;The Station Kitchen&#x27;.

<doc id="1160658" wikidata="Q857590" url="?curid=1160658" title="Makio Inoue">
<text>was a Japanese actor and voice actor.

He is most noted for his two longstanding roles, as the title character in Captain Harlock from 1978 through the 1980s and 1990s, and Goemon Ishikawa XIII of &quot;Lupin III&quot; from 1977 to 2011.

== Career ==
Inoue&#x27;s childhood of watching mobile theater troupes gave him a longing to be an actor, and by the time he was in high school, he was appearing in TV movies. At the time, he also admired poets, and his stage name “Makio (Inoue himself uses the English name “Maqio”).” was derived from his pen name at that time.

Around 1960, he and a friend founded a theater company influenced by Underground culture and began working as stage actors. However, the money to maintain the stage soon disappeared and his life became difficult, so he decided that he had to earn money. It was then that he was invited by an acquaintance to audition for the Japanese dubbed version of the TV series “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis” and was chosen for the lead role. This was the beginning of his career as a voice actor.

In 1968, he appeared in the animated television series &quot;Star of the Giants&quot;. His role in the anime was well-received, and he was given more opportunities to play cool, beautiful young men and the main character&#x27;s rivals.

By the 1970s, he had established an idol-like popularity that led to the establishment of a fan club, and he was considered one of the “top three most popular voice actors in Japan.

Starting in 1977, he played Goemon Ishikawa XIII in the &quot;Lupin III&quot; series, which became one of his best-known works. Inoue was hired to replace Chikao Ohtsuka, but was told by the director at the time that the character of Goemon had changed from Chikao&#x27;s “hard-killing man” to a “young, beautiful-faced swordsman,” and that the voice actor had changed to you. Inoue thus gave his own personality to the character, without being conscious of Chikao&#x27;s. Inoue later said affectionately of Goemon, “He is an important character who has influenced me in many ways in my life&quot;. He also said that the best part of acting is “giving a presence from a few lines&quot;.

He played the title character in Captain Harlock from 1978 through the 1990s.

In the 1980s, as his popularity began to wane, he scaled back his voice acting activities and began to focus more on his stage career.

He later became a buddhist monk and built his own temple in Chiba Prefecture. In addition to his work as an actor and voice actor, including providing the voice of Master Eraqus in the “Kingdom Hearts” series, he began to go on regular training trips, including retreats deep into the mountains to sit in zazen meditation in order to attain enlightenment. Since then, he has been wearing samue and geta (Japanese clogs) to recordings and visiting studios on a moped motorcycle.

In 2011, Inoue dropped the role of Goemon at the request of the production company, he was succeeded in the role of Goemon by Daisuke Namikawa.

In the 2000s, he hit it off with dancer Sui-sei, whom he met through stage work; with Sui-sei as his partner, in 2017 he opened an Twitter account and resumed his interactions with his former fans; in 2019, he launched a “lifetime project” and a YouTube channel was also launched.

But on November 29, 2019, he died at his home in Chiba Prefecture due to worsening angina pectoris, a chronic illness; he died at age 80.

<text>Cragg Vale is a village in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England, located south of Mytholmroyd on the B6138 road which joins the A58 and the A646. The village is part of Luddendenfoot Ward of Calderdale Council.

==History==

===Early days===
There is evidence of human activity on the Yorkshire moors around Cragg from c. 10,000 BC. Flints, not native to West Yorkshire, have been found on Blackstone and Midgley Moors – implying movement of peoples and long-distance trade by this period at the latest.

Later flint spear heads and arrow tips, hunting weapons, have been found in quantity over Manshead and Rishworth moors. So we know Mesolithic tribes hunted around both the Turvin and Cragg areas.

Hunters were constrained to move across the high reaches, which were less heavily wooded, rather than the steep sided valleys – but to cross from top to top they must descend to ford the streams and rivers of the valley bottoms.

Although prehistoric and later peoples were responsible for extensive tree felling and land clearance this did not create the peat moors above Cragg Vale.

Around 5000 BC the climate changed and became much wetter and remained so for over 2,000 years. Soil deteriorated as minerals were washed away, and the land around Cragg became waterlogged. The trees and plant life died away and the peat moors on the tops were created.

We know from place naming and language conventions that ancient Britons (the Brigantes tribe), Anglo Saxons, Vikings, and Romans had a large input into the area of Cragg.

===Romans===
The Romans left little except their (disputed) road over Blackstone Edge as evidence – but there would have been extensive forced population relocation as the engineers and troops pushed forwards.

We know the Romans made a pact with the Brigantes tribe, and that this whole area of West Yorkshire – the centre of the ancient kingdom of Elmet – was ruled by them. Little remains of Elmet but the ancient names. Close by Cragg lies the hamlet of Warley, and not much further away to the west lies Walsden – both names relate to the &#x27;Walh&#x27; – a term used for the Britons. This implies a residual British culture after the invasion and takeover by the victorious Anglo Saxons

The Britons were annexed by the Romans by 100 AD, and c. 700 AD the Saxons arrived. Around 1000 AD, the Vikings gained control. They in turn were overcome by the Normans by 1100 AD. Leading into the Medieval period

The primary industry was agriculture, but iron was smelted too, good timber and charcoal was produced, and grain was milled. Local craftsmen produce some cloth, make clothing, farm implements, and utensils while others provide transport services and labour.

Cragg was part of a township called Cruttonstall (later called Erringden) and adjacent to the township of Sowerby (Sorebi from the Norse).
All the land between Cragg and Sowerby was gradually cleared of dense forest to make way for agriculture as the population grew.

The land to the West, and a large part of Cragg Vale, was soon to be partly cleared and &#x27;impaled&#x27; as a huge deer park and royal hunting ground.

===Medieval===
In late Medieval times the deer park fell into disrepair and was finally dispaled. Knights no longer took the rough ride down The Withens toward Wakefield tourney. The wild boars, stags and wolves were in serious decline and sheep were now the major local industry.

===18th and 19th century===
During the late 18th century, the area was the home of a band of counterfeiters known as the Cragg Vale Coiners.

Having a good supply of water from the moors, Cragg was always a likely home for industry based on water power. From mid-1700 onwards, water then steam power, and combined water wheel and steam engines dominated the valley with the cloth mills.

There were a number of families involved in mill ownership during this time. Sutcliffes, Greenwoods, and Hinchliffes amongst others. Yet in 1758 there were but 3 mills in Cragg. A paper mill (just up from and on the opposite side of the main road the Robin Hood Inn), a corn mill (at Hoo Hole), and a mill for fulling woven cloth from the farms.

The water driven mills that flourished at Turvin, Marshaw Village (by the Hinchliffe Arms pub) and on Elphin Brook (down Cragg Vale) posed no real threat to local farm based weavers at that time.

However, from 1808 onwards things began to change alarmingly for the worse. Steam power was heavily adopted from around 1805 on. Child labour became the norm. Now began the mill owners infamous abuses.

At one time or another from 1740 to the early 20th century there have existed around 11 mills in Cragg.

Turvin, Victoria, and Pepper Bank mills on Turvin Brook; Marshaw (opposite the Hinchliffe Arms) with New and Vale mills in Withens Clough. Next down Elphin Brook were Castle, Paper (opposite the Robin Hood Inn), Cragg, Hoo Hole, and Scar Bottom mill (Mytholmroyd). By the 1820s these were said to be no place for &quot;any decent human, let alone the children of the poor&quot;.

It is on record that children died at their work in the mills of Cragg. Died from long hours and harsh treatments handed out. While the mill owners William Greenwood (&#x27;Old Billy Hard Times&#x27;) and the Hinchliffe family amassed their fortunes. It took the 1833 factory act just to begin to address the appalling abuse of child labour and workers

A turnpike known as the Mytholmroyd Bridge &amp; Blackstone Edge Turnpike, and also as the Cragg Vale Turnpike was established in 1815:

The road runs from County Bridge, Mytholmroyd and up Cragg Road to link with the Halifax to Blackstone Edge turnpike over Blackstone Edge to Rochdale. Tolls were discontinued on 1 November 1873.

==Governance==
The village is part of the Luddendenfoot ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire.

==Current day==
Although Cragg Vale is a small linear village, it has two pubs &quot;The Robin Hood Inn&quot; and the &quot;Hinchliffe Arms&quot;, and a &quot;Caravan and Motorhome Club Site&quot;. In the last few years the village has expanded with a children&#x27;s nursery called &quot;The Ark&quot;, a recording studio &quot;Aspire Technology&quot; being added to the village. The main business areas in Cragg Vale are the Top Land Country Business Park, as well as the Craggs Country Business Park further up the valley. Local enterprises include The Little Valley Brewery which produces such locally named brews as Cragg Vale Bitter, Stoodley Stout, Hebdens Wheat &amp; Tod&#x27;s Blonde among others, Zikodrive Motor Controllers, Visiosound and Vocation Brewery.

Today, Cragg Vale has a population of about 650.
It is located at the start of arguably the longest continuous gradient in England (after perhaps Pishill in The Chilterns)- 968 feet over 5.5 miles There is an annual bike race up it; this is a hill climb and normally run by the Yorkshire road club. The record is currently at 14:19 for males and 18:47 for females. In July 2014, the hill formed part of the route of the 2014 Tour de France.

<text>Mayor Island / Tūhua is a dormant shield volcano located off the Bay of Plenty coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It lies north of Tauranga and covers .

==Geography==

The island is quite steep along its coast and rises to above sea level. A saddle about deep separates it from the North Island, while the other side of the volcano rises from the seafloor some beneath the waves. Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Mayor Island / Tūhua was connected to the rest of New Zealand. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, separating Mayor Island / Tūhua from the mainland. Hot springs may be found on the island&#x27;s northern side, and there are two small crater lakes, Green Lake and Black Lake. These lie within two overlapping calderas formed in explosive eruptions 36,000 and 6,340 years ago.

===Geology===
Mayor Island is characterised as a peralkaline volcano and has exhibited a wide range of eruptive styles, including lava fountains, Strombolian explosions, extrusion of lava domes, phreatomagmatic explosions, Plinian falls and ignimbrite. The most recent lava flows have been dated at between 500 and 1,000 years old.

The Tūhua Caldera formed in the &gt; eruptive volume event of 6,340 years ago and also is a partial collapse crater. It is by in size. The Tuhua Tephra is quite distinctive and due to it having two dispersion patterns has been found in the Auckland area where it is up to 7 cm thick, at Rotorua up to 10 cm thick and Lake Waikaremoana where it is 4 cm thick, making it useful as a mid-Holocene marker horizon. It has also been characterised from multiple sea bed cores off the East coast from the Havre trough off the Bay of Plenty to the southern North Island off Cape Turnagain.

Te Paritu Tephra is assigned to a Mayor Island eruption but the full recent significant eruptive sequence required sea cores as prevailing winds are off land.
In summary recent eruptions are:

====Risks====
The island would likely be sterilised in a typical major pyroclastic eruption at their current frequency of about every 7,000 years although a small eruption could be confined within the caldera. Tsunami activity and ash affecting the Bay of Plenty are possible with initial vent clearing and ash falls toward the major cities of the northern half of the North island being most likely in summer, with economic disruption to especially ports and airports. Usually however the ash fall will be away from land. However it has been estimated that a worse case tsunami could be high when it reached Bay of Plenty coastal resorts and the city of Tauranga with possibly only 30 minutes warning. Most of the infrastructure of these coastal towns is less than above sea level so is at risk of complete destruction.

==History==

Captain James Cook called it Mayor Island when he sighted it on 3 November 1769, in recognition of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day to be held in London a few days later.

The Ngāti Whakaue led a military expedition to the island in 1842, after a tribesman was killed by the Whanau a Tauwhao, a hapu of Ngāi Te Rangi

The island is considered special by Māori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) partly because of the presence of black obsidian, a volcanic glass created by the rapid cooling of silica-rich lava, prized as a cutting tool. The obsidian was called Tūhua by Māori, who called the island by the same name. Over 80% of obsidian excavated from Matakawau on Great Mercury Island had been sourced from Tūhua. Several pa sites are known on the island, the final of which was inhabited until 1901.

== Uses and recreation ==

The area of the Bay of Plenty around the island is renowned for game fishing, with marlin, mako sharks, and swordfish all inhabiting the surrounding waters. Some of the island and the waters close to its shores, however, are now a small marine reserve. There are several tramping tracks around the island, and it is also popular with divers. Mayor Island today is a wildlife refuge. A small number of holiday houses are located in Opo Bay on the south coast of the island, along with a camp ground and a few rental cabins. The 2001 census showed a population of three, after zero in 1996 and 12 in 1991 (all figures randomised for privacy on a Base-3 system).

<doc id="1160663" wikidata="Q1949695" url="?curid=1160663" title="Mōtītī Island">
<text>Mōtītī Island is an island in the Bay of Plenty, off the coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is north-east of Papamoa Beach on the mainland and north-east of Tauranga. There were 18 homes occupied by 27 people on the island in the 2006 census.

==Geography==

A relatively flat island covering some , Mōtītī Island is composed mainly of Miocene andesitic basalt volcanic rocks, overlaid with more recent sediments in the south. The principal activity on the island is agriculture, with a developing avocado plantation. Most residents and visitors travel to the island by air.

There is no public infrastructure (e.g. no public wharf) and the whole island is in private ownership. Access is difficult and expensive. Bay of Plenty Regional Council has regional council responsibility for Mōtītī Island. No territorial authority council is responsible for it – therefore residents pay no rates and there are no council services. Day-to-day administration is by the Department of Internal Affairs.

==History and culture==

===Pre-colonial history===
On 2 November 1769, during his first voyage, Captain Cook sailed close inshore to Mōtītī Island, where he reported the most extensive complex of fortified villages he had yet seen. In his journal he refers to it as the &quot;Flat Island&quot;.

===Recent history===
On 5 October 2011 the container ship MV &quot;Rena&quot; ran aground on Astrolabe Reef, seven kilometers north of Mōtītī Island. Oil from the resulting spill, as well as shipping containers and their contents, reached the shore of the island. In October 2013, Mōtītī Island residents rejected an offer by the MV Rena&#x27;s owners to start a development project for the island, in return for being able to leave the Rena wreckage where it lay. The plan included:

* Building a landing point for barges
* Creating a one-lane, all-weather road to the airstrip
* Installing a new cellphone tower to improve communications
* Running an underground cable from the mainland to improve power supply
* Putting a permanent beacon on Astrolabe Reef
* Building a Rena memorial from the ship&#x27;s anchor

On 9 October 2011, the 45-foot launch M/V &quot;Excalibur&quot; ran aground on Mōtītī Island in bad weather. The crew of six was rescued, but the boat was considered a total loss.

===Marae===

The island has two marae, belonging to the Ngāti Awa hapū of Te Patuwai and Ngāti Maumoana: Te Hinga o te Ra or Te Karioi Marae and Te Hinga o te Ra meeting house; and Te Rua Kopiha Marae and Tamatea ki te Huatahi meeting house.

In October 2020, the Government committed $4,871,246 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade a group of 12 marae, including Te Rua Kopiha Marae. The funding was expected to create 23 jobs.

==Aerodrome==
Island Air Charters operates to Motiti Island from Tauranga and back with 1 Cessna 206 and 2 Cessna 172 aircraft. In addition, Sunair operates to Motiti Island from Tauranga and back with 3 Cessna 172 aircraft, and the Tauranga Aero Club operates to Motiti Island from Tauranga and back with 3 Cessna 172 aircraft.

<text>The Cholsey and Wallingford Railway is a long standard gauge heritage railway in the English county of Oxfordshire. It operates along most of the length of the former Wallingford branch of the Great Western Railway (GWR), from Cholsey station, north of Reading on the Great Western Main Line, to a station on the outskirts of the nearby town of Wallingford.

==History==

The first proposals for the Cholsey to Wallingford line date from 1861, and envisaged an independently owned route from Cholsey to Princes Risborough via Wallingford, Benson, Watlington and Chinnor. This line would have been a through route, with junctions with the Great Western Railway at Cholsey and the Wycombe Railway at Princes Risborough. In 1862, a Bill was presented to Parliament for a short branch from Cholsey to Wallingford, but this was withdrawn early in 1863, before it had come up for consideration. It was replaced by the Wallingford and Watlington Railway Bill which was passed by Parliament in July 1864.

The W&amp;WR opened as far as Wallingford on 2 July 1866. Unfortunately, two months earlier, in May 1866, the Overend, Gurney &amp; Co bank had crashed, causing the severest financial crisis of the nineteenth century. The Bank Rate was raised to 10%, making it impossible for the W&amp;WR to raise the capital for its planned continuation to Watlington. In 1871, Parliament consented to the railway abandoning its plans for the line beyond Wallingford. The company was sold to the GWR in 1872.

The railway became popularly known as the &quot;Wallingford Bunk&quot;. The Curator of the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway Museum attributes the following story to the late Mrs Harold Gale. &quot;Around the turn of the century, the loco did a &#x27;bunk&#x27;. It left Cholsey station without its coaches. Harold and Len Gale, returning from football in Reading, had uncoupled the loco while it waited in the bay platform.&quot;

The line closed to passengers in 1959, and the last British Rail goods traffic into the old Wallingford Station ran in 1965. However most of the line was retained to serve the maltings adjacent to the railway to the south of Hithercroft Road, Wallingford. Rail service to this plant ceased in 1981 when BR removed the junction at Cholsey. The Cholsey and Wallingford Railway Preservation Society was then formed to conserve the line for tourist services. It first ran train rides for the public in 1985, with regular advertised services over the full available length of the line beginning in 1997. Steam traction has also been reintroduced.

==Services==
Most services on the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway are currently hauled by the Class 08 resident diesel locomotives with visiting steam locomotives for special events. Trains run on weekends and bank holidays between April and September, and at Halloween and Christmas. The railway&#x27;s web site has details of operating days.

The original branch platform at Cholsey station is now used by the CWR, and trains connect there with Great Western Railway stopping services on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and Didcot stations.

The original Wallingford railway station and the last segment of the line have long been built on, and the old station site is now crossed by Beeching Way. The line now terminates at a makeshift station which is the railway&#x27;s headquarters on Hithercroft Road (formerly known as Old Moor Lane). The new station is adjacent to the site of the maltings that kept the line alive into the preservation era. The maltings were demolished early in the new millennium and replaced by housing, releasing some extra land to the railway. The CWR plans to build a permanent station when resources are available.

==Rolling stock==

===Locomotives===
The line is the home to several diesel locomotives, including three of British Rail&#x27;s ubiquitous Class 08 shunters, which are used on most trains. Steam also currently operates on the railway, by locomotives Peckett 2142 and 6515 Isebrook.

<text>Abdul Qadir Khan SI (, 15 September 1955 – 6 September 2019) was an international cricketer who bowled leg spin for Pakistan. Abdul Qadir is widely regarded as a legendary leg spinner from the 1970s and 1980s and was a role model for up and coming leg spinners. His unique style of bowling consisted of a rhythmic cantering walk before the ball toss. Qadir was voted the best player in the Group B matches of the 1987 Cricket World Cup and won a car which he donated to Imran Khan for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre project. Later he was a commentator and Chief Selector of the Pakistan Cricket Board, from which he resigned in 2009 due to differences of opinion with leading Pakistan cricket administrators.

Abdul Qadir appeared in 67 Tests and 104 One Day International (ODI) matches between 1977 and 1993, and captained the Pakistan cricket team in five ODIs. In Test cricket, his best performance for a series was 30 wickets for 437 runs, in three Test matches at home, against England in 1987. He achieved Pakistan&#x27;s best bowling figures in a Test innings, which was nine wickets for 56 against the same team at the Gaddafi Stadium in the same series in 1987. In November 2022, Abdul Qadir was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

In ODIs, his best bowling figures were five wickets for 44 runs against Sri Lanka during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He was a member of the Pakistani team in the 1983 and 1987 Cricket World Cups. Yahoo! Cricket described Abdul Qadir as &quot;a master of the leg-spin&quot; who &quot;mastered the googlies, the flippers, the leg-breaks and the topspins.&quot; He is widely regarded as a top spin bowler of his generation and was included in Richie Benaud&#x27;s Greatest XI shortlist of an imaginary cricket team from the best players available from all countries and eras. Former English captain Graham Gooch said that Abdul Qadir &quot;was even finer than Shane Warne&quot;.

He was educated at the Government College University, Lahore.

==First-class career==
Abdul Qadir played first-class cricket for Lahore, Punjab and Habib Bank Limited cricket teams during 1975–95. During his first-class career, he achieved five or more wickets in an innings on seventy-five occasions, and ten or more wickets in a match twenty-one times. He also scored two centuries and eight half centuries in first-class cricket.

Abdul Qadir made his debut for Habib Bank against United Bank Limited at the National Stadium during the 1975–76 season. He took seven wickets in the match conceding 93 runs, including six wickets for 67 runs in the first innings. Playing for Lahore C, he took six for 17 against Bahawalpur, his best bowling figures of the season.

Abdul Qadir played 209 first-class matches and took 960 wickets with an average of 23.24. His best bowling figures for an innings were nine wickets for 56 runs, whereas his best performance for a match was 13 wickets for 101 runs. As a batsman, he scored 3,740 runs, averaging 18.33 from 247 innings. He also scored two centuries and eight fifties. Abdul Qadir&#x27;s highest score in the format was 112 runs. Qadir played his last first-class match in 1994.

==International career==
===Test career===
Natural talent combined with aggression and passion made Abdul Qadir one of the most successful spinners of his era. He had a distinct run-up, bounding in to the crease, and a great variety of deliveries: there was the orthodox leg-break, the topspinner, two googlies and the flipper. He was unique for bowling leg spin at a time when it was not only rare but considered obsolete, and he kept the torch alight for a generation of leg spinners. His fervent appeals made him a great favourite with the spectators but sometimes got him into trouble with umpires. Abdul Qadir played 67 Test matches during 1977–90 and took 236 wickets, with an average of 32.80, including 15 five-wicket hauls. His best bowling performance was against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in 1987. He also scored 1,029 runs including three fifties.

Abdul Qadir showed promise from his very first Test series, bowling along with left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim, with &quot;Wisden Almanack&quot; describing him as &quot;the most notable discovery of his type for some time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WEnginPak77/78&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WEnginPak77/78T2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Test debut against England at his home ground, Gaddafi Stadium, on 14 December 1977. His leg-breaks and googlies both caused problems for the English batsmen, but he was only able to take one wicket and his length began to falter late in the innings, forcing Pakistan to take the new ball and bowl their fast bowlers instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;WEnginPak77/78T1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEnginPak77/78T1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was far more successful in the second Test match. He took 6 wickets for 44 runs in 24 overs, bowling around the wicket into the footmarks of English fast bowler Bob Willis, giving him the best bowling figures for a Pakistan bowler against England.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEnginPak77/78T2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After taking five wickets in the third and final Test match,&lt;ref name=&quot;WEnginPak77/78T3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEnginPak77/78T3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 12 wickets at an average of 25.41.

Abdul Qadir&#x27;s second Test series, in England in 1978, was an injury-plagued let-down, but he was a strong and established force by his return in 1982, when his six wickets in the Lord&#x27;s Test played a major role in a historic Pakistani victory. He took ten wickets in the series with an average of 40.60.

Abdul Qadir&#x27;s first significant performance came in the 1982–83 series against Australia, taking seven wickets for 156 runs and 11 wickets for 218 runs in the first two Test matches—man of the match in both the matches. He accumulated 22 wickets—Pakistani record against Australia—conceding 562 runs and with the average of 25.54 in the three-Test series. Due to his performance with the ball, he won the man of the series award for first time in his Test career. Pakistan clean-swept the series, winning the first and the third Test by nine wickets each, and the second Test by an innings and three runs. Qadir took 19 wickets for 451 runs with the help of three five-wicket hauls in following home series against England. Pakistan recorded their first series win against England. In the 1985–86 home series against Sri Lanka, he took six wickets in the third match at Karachi.

At the Kennington Oval in 1987, Abdul Qadir&#x27;s ten-wicket haul ensured another series win, this time in England. Three months later, Abdul Qadir brought his art to an all new level – in the next home series against the same team – taking 30 wickets for 437 runs in three Tests including the best bowling figures in an innings by a Pakistani, nine wickets for 56 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium. This is also the seventh best performance for an innings in Test cricket, and the best by any bowler against England. He achieved his career best performance in an innings, 61 runs, at the National Stadium, Karachi. Abdul Qadir&#x27;s tremendous performance earned him another man of the series award, and Pakistan won another series against England. During this crusade, he moved past the 200-wicket mark, becoming the first man from his country ever to do so. Abdul Qadir was ineffective against India in the 1989–90 home series, taking only six wickets from four Tests with an average above 57. He played his last Test against the West Indies in December 1990 at the Gaddafi Stadium.

===One Day International career===
Abdul Qadir made his ODI debut against New Zealand at Edgbaston during 1983 Cricket World Cup; he took four wickets for 21 runs in 12 overs, earning him the man of the match award. He took 12 wickets for 264 runs in the tournament with an average of 22.00, including a five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka at Headingley, Leeds. In the 1983–84 World Series Cup, Abdul Qadir played eight matches and took 15 wickets at the average of 18.13, including five wickets for 53 against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a match Pakistan lost by 43 runs. In the 1985–86 home season, he took six wickets against Sri Lanka, and five wickets against the West Indies including four wickets for 17 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium. Abdul Qadir&#x27;s eight wickets in six matches were the second highest figures against India in 1986–87. Sachin Tendulkar played him smoothly in his first Test series for India, and it may have been his attacking batting, which cut short Abdul Qadir&#x27;s Test career.

Abdul Qadir captained the Pakistan cricket team during England&#x27;s tour to Pakistan, losing all the three matches; he topped the list of highest wicket takers during the 1987–88 series between the teams, with eight wickets at the average of 13.17. He took six wickets during the 1988–89 Wills Asia Cup at the average of 17.00, including three wickets for 27 runs, against India in the fifth match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. During the Nehru Cup in 1989–90, he was second in the list of leading wicket takers, with 12 wicket from seven matches at the average of 21.75. His best figure in a match during the tournament were three wickets for 27 runs, against Australia at the Brabourne Stadium, Bombay. Abdul Qadir played his last ODI against Sri Lanka at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in 1993. In total, Abdul Qadir played 104 ODIs during 1977–93, taking 132 wickets and averaged 26.16. He also took two five-wicket hauls, including his best ODI performance of five wickets for 44 runs against Sri Lanka during the 1983 World Cup. He scored 641 runs in ODIs, and his highest score in this format of the game was 41 not out.

==Captaincy==
Abdul Qadir was not successful as a captain. He captained the Pakistan cricket team in five Test matches during 1987–88 and 1988–89, losing four of them. He captained Pakistan for the first time against England, in the absence of regular captain, Javed Miandad. The three matches he captained in, against the same team, were lost by Pakistan. In ODI matches, Abdul Qadir captained Pakistan against Bangladesh and India in the fourth and fifth match of the 1988 Asia Cup respectively; Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by 173 runs, and lost to India by four wickets.

==As chief selector==
Abdul Qadir replaced Saleem Jaffar, former Pakistan fast bowler, as chief selector in November 2008 for the series against India. A series of three Tests, five ODIs and three T20Is was scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan; the series could not take place due to the deterioration of both countries&#x27; diplomatic relationship after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. His next assignment was team selection for the home series against Sri Lanka; the tour was arranged as a replacement for the scheduled tour of India which was cancelled by BCCI. The series was abandoned following an attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore during the second Test between the teams. Abdul Qadir resigned from the post in June 2009 without explaining any concern.

==Controversy==
Talking with Hasan Jalil at Pakistan Television (PTV) show in 2004, Abdul Qadir said: &quot;We all know the ball has always been made up [tampered with] by Pakistani fast bowlers, but with so much scrutiny on this series, this has not been possible.&quot; PTV cancelled his contract stating that &quot;We are a national network and we have certain codes of conduct on what can and cannot be said on air. By talking about ball-tampering and claiming that every successful Pakistani bowler had &#x27;made&#x27; the ball, he was damaging national pride, and that is against our policy. So we dropped him.&quot;

==Personal life==
Abdul Qadir was born on 15 September 1955 in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. His brother, Ali Bahadur, was also a leg-spinner who appeared in 10 first-class matches during 1986–87. Abdul Qadir&#x27;s three sons Rehman Qadir, Imran Qadir and Sulaman Qadir—also represented different Pakistani teams in the first-class competition, while his younger son, Usman Qadir, has played in 12 List A matches. His daughter, Noor Aamina, married Umar Akmal.

==Death and legacy==
On 7 September 2019, Abdul Qadir died of cardiac arrest in Lahore. Qadir died nine days before his 64th birthday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) paid tributes to Abdul Qadir with their chairman, Ehsan Mani, calling him a &quot;maestro with the ball&quot;. Wasim Khan, the PCB&#x27;s Chief Executive added: &quot;Abdul Qadir was one of the all-time greatest. His friendly and warm presence will forever be missed&quot;.

Shane Warne said: &quot;It&#x27;s very sad news, so condolences to Abdul Qadir&#x27;s family. I had the opportunity to meet him in 1994 on my first tour to Pakistan. I think a lot of people who bowled leg-spin, like I did, he was the guy who we looked up to in the eighties. He was the main leg-spinner in that era. He was a terrific bowler who bamboozled a lot of batsmen. His record is a terrific one.&quot;

Prime Minister Imran Khan called him &quot;a genius, one of the greatest leg spinners of all time&quot;, adding that &quot;Qadir&#x27;s bowling statistics do not do justice to his genius&quot;.

He was posthumously awarded Sitara-i-Imtiaz the third highest civilian award of Pakistan by the Government of Pakistan in 2021.

<text>Shannon Patricia Elizabeth O&#x27;Brien (born April 30, 1959) is an American politician and attorney who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1987 through 1993, in the Massachusetts Senate from 1993 through 1995, and was the Massachusetts state treasurer from 1999 through 2003. In that last position she became the first woman to be elected in Massachusetts to statewide office by her own accord. She was the Democratic Party nominee in the 2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, but lost in the general election to Mitt Romney.

==Early life and education==
Four generations of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s family have served in elected office in Massachusetts government. Her great-grandfather, Michael T. O&#x27;Brien, was the proprietor of the family funeral home in Easthampton, Massachusetts, and first elected to the state legislature in 1930. Her father Edward O&#x27;Brien (1933–2004) was a lawyer who served on the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council from 1970 to 1975 and left the post to run for Massachusetts attorney general, losing the 1974 Democratic primary to Francis X. Belotti. He then ran for Congress in 1976, losing to the incumbent Silvio Conte; he returned to the Governor&#x27;s Council after the 1978 election and remained in office until his death in 2004.
Shannon&#x27;s mother is named Ann. Shannon has four siblings: Erin, a clerk at the West Roxbury District Court; Gaelan, a court officer in the Northampton District Court; Tara, a former employee at Boston City Hall; and Michael, who runs the family funeral home in Easthampton.

O&#x27;Brien was born in Boston, Massachusetts. She graduated from Yale University in 1981, where she was captain of the Yale Bulldogs varsity women&#x27;s soccer team. She received her Juris Doctor degree from the Boston University School of Law in 1985.

==Career==

=== Politics ===

O&#x27;Brien worked for a large Boston law firm before her father alerted her to an open seat in the state legislature, which she won.
O&#x27;Brien served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1987 through 1993, and in the Massachusetts Senate from 1993 through 1995. While a state legislator she authored a law that increased penalties for crimes against children such as abuse and neglect.

She was the Massachusetts state treasurer from 1999 through 2003, winning the office in the Massachusetts general election, 1998, after losing in her first attempt for that office in Massachusetts general election, 1994 and subsequently working as a vice president for external affairs at a health-care company. She was the first woman to be elected in Massachusetts to statewide office by her own accord. She came into the office after it had suffered a major embezzlement scandal, and she tightened controls over the funds involved. While serving as State Treasurer, she restructured the lottery commission and the Abandoned Properties Division in Massachusetts, gaining acclaim for returning dormant funds to the residents of the state. She also refinanced state debt and in doing so saved about $500 million. In dealing with the near-infamous Big Dig project in Boston, which became the most expensive highway project in U.S. history, she forced public disclosure of a $2 billion cost overrun.

She won the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2002, defeating State Senate President Thomas Birmingham, former Democratic National Committee and American Israel Public Affairs Committee chair Steven Grossman, former United States Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and former nominee for lieutenant governor Warren Tolman. In this action she became the first woman to win a major party nomination for governor in the Commonwealth. In the general election she garnered 45 percent of the vote to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 50 percent.

===Later career===
Following her defeat in 2002, O&#x27;Brien joined Boston-area local television station WLVI as a consumer advocate. She left the station in 2005 to head the Boston Area Girl Scouts, and as such is the CEO of the Patriot&#x27;s Trail Girl Scout Council covering Greater Boston.

In January 2014 OIKOS Software appointed O&#x27;Brien to its board of directors.

In August 2022, State Treasurer and Receiver General Deb Goldberg appointed O&#x27;Brien as Chair of the Cannabis Control Commission. She was suspended from the position by the State Treasurer on September 15, 2023.

== Personal life ==
O&#x27;Brien lives in Massachusetts with her husband, former state representative Emmet Hayes, and children.

==Electoral history==
*2002 election for Governor
**Mitt Romney (R), 49.8%
**Shannon O&#x27;Brien (D), 44.9%
**Jill Stein (G), 3.5%
**Carla Howell (L), 1.1%

<doc id="1160680" wikidata="Q3403069" url="?curid=1160680" title="Robert Croft">
<text>Robert Damien Bale Croft (born 25 May 1970) is a former Welsh cricketer who played international cricket for the England cricket team. He is an off-spin bowler who played for Glamorgan and captained the county from 2003 to 2006. He retired from first class cricket at the end of the 2012 season, having played county cricket for 23 seasons. He commentates on cricket occasionally for Sky Sports.

==Early life and education==
Croft was born on 25 May 1970 in Morriston, Swansea. He was educated at St John Lloyd Roman Catholic Comprehensive School, Llanelli. He played rugby union as a scrum half for Llanelli RFC Under-11s. He studied at Swansea Metropolitan University.

==Cricketing career==
He made his England debut against Pakistan in 1996, and did enough to earn a touring place to Zimbabwe and New Zealand. In Christchurch, he took his Test best figures of 5–95 and his winter figures were a highly impressive 182.1–53–340–18. He played the first five tests of the 1997 Ashes series but was dropped for the final test, replaced by Phil Tufnell, after averaging 54 with the ball and showing a weakness to short-pitched fast bowling as a batsman. 

Around this time, Croft was involved in what ESPNCricinfo calls &quot;an unsavoury, but in truth pretty harmless, pushing and finger-wagging incident&quot; with Mark Ilott during the NatWest Trophy semi-final against Essex, which Glamorgan narrowly lost. However Croft had a happier experience that year in helping his county to their first County Championship in 28 years, Croft taking 54 wickets in Glamorgan&#x27;s campaign at an average of 23.31. 

Croft toured the West Indies with England that winter, but in spite of taking six wickets in the fourth Test, it was the only Test he played that series. Restored to the England Test team the following summer, his last-wicket stand with Angus Fraser in the third Test of the 1998 series against South Africa saved England from an innings defeat, Croft personally scoring his highest Test score, 37 not out. &quot;Wisden&quot; observed that &quot;England found an unlikely hero in Croft, who made up for three wicketless Tests by keeping his end intact for more than three hours&quot;. Croft was dropped for the next Test, although his innings helped to shift the momentum in the series, which England won. He enjoyed another relatively successful tour in Sri Lanka early in 2001, taking nine wickets at 28.66 as England won the three-match Test series. In general, Croft was a more effective Test bowler overseas, where he took 35 wickets in 9 Tests at 24.65, than in England, where he took 14 wickets in 12 Tests at 68.71.

His final Test match was the third Ashes Test of 2001 at Trent Bridge where he bowled just 3 overs. He was selected for the subsequent tour of India but he withdrew because of safety fears and was also selected for the 2003/04 tour of Sri Lanka but failed to play. After returning home, he announced his international retirement to concentrate on the captaincy of Glamorgan.

On 12 September 2006, after just two County Championship victories in 15 games thus far in the season, he announced his resignation from the captaincy, and was succeeded by David Hemp.

Exactly a year later, he passed 1,000 first-class wickets after dismissing Niall O&#x27;Brien; he became the first Welsh cricketer to take the double of 10,000 first-class career runs and 1,000 first-class career wickets. As of March 2022, he is the last cricketer anywhere to achieve this feat in first-class cricket, and with the increasing focus of higher-ability cricketers on limited-over forms of the game, he is likely to remain the last. In November 2007, he joined voices calling for a &quot;clampdown&quot; on Twenty20 problems with abusive crowds, after suffering abusive calls at Taunton Cricket Ground. On 1 August 2010 he got his first hat-trick against Gloucestershire to help Glamorgan win the match. It also made him the first Glamorgan spinner to take a hat-trick in 46 years.

Croft was once honoured as a druid at the Welsh cultural event, the National Eisteddfod.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to cricket.

In October 2018, Croft left his role as Glamorgan head coach.

<doc id="1160688" wikidata="Q2739165" url="?curid=1160688" title="Mahela Jayawardene">
<text>Denagamage Praboth Mahela de Silva Jayawardene (; born 27 May 1977) is a Sri Lankan former professional cricketer and captain of the Sri Lankan national cricket team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen from Sri Lankan cricket.

During the time of his captaincy Jayawardene led his national team to be the winners of the 2008 Asia Cup. Jayawardene was the first Sri Lankan in the history of the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup to score a century which he did with his 100 runs against Zimbabwe in the 2010 tournament.

He made his Test cricket debut in August 1997 and his One Day International (ODI) debut the following season in January 1998. In 2006 along with his teammate Kumar Sangakkara, Jayawardene made the highest ever partnership in First-class cricket, scoring 624 runs for the third wicket in the first test match of Sri Lanka&#x27;s home series against South Africa. He appeared in 652 international matches representing Sri Lanka in a career spanning for about 18 years. During his international career, he also formed a friendship and healthy rivalry with Sangakkara.

Mahela is the first player in the history of Sri Lankan cricket to score over 10,000 Test runs and is also the second Sri Lankan player to score more than 10,000 runs in ODIs after Sanath Jayasuriya. Mahela Jayawardene currently serves as the Chairman of Sri Lanka National Sports Council.

Jayawardene&#x27;s highest test score, 374 against South Africa, is the highest score by a right-handed batsman in the history of Test cricket. Along with teammate Sangakkara, he has the most career partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 run record of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar.

Jayawardene was a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made to the final of 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20.

In 2006, Jayawardene was named by the International Cricket Council as the best International captain of the year and was nominated in 2007 as the best Test cricket player of the year. He is also known for his fielding skills in the inner ring, with a report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the most run-outs in ODI cricket of any fielder, with the fifth highest run-out/match ratio in ODI&#x27;s.

Jayawardene also worked as an international TV commentator in the first test at Headingley on 19 May 2016 between England and Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene holds the unique record of being the only player as of now to have scored a hundred in both a World Cup final and a World Cup semi-final. He is also the only player to have scored a century in a World Cup final in a losing cause.

He also serves as a board member in several unlisted public limited companies in Sri Lanka. He has been a vocal critic of Sri Lanka Cricket over the years especially after 2015 where the national side has suffered a significant decline.

In November 2021, he was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He became only the third Sri Lankan to be inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame after Muttiah Muralitharan and Kumar Sangakkara.

== Career ==

=== Early and domestic career ===
Jayawardene was educated at Nalanda College Colombo. At an early age Mahela&#x27;s father, Senerath Jayawardene, introduced him to the Lionel Coaching Clinic run by Nondescripts Cricket Club in Cinnamon Gardens. It was there that he learned to play cricket. He was a fast bowler initially during his school days and later transformed as a top order batsman. Jayawardene captained Nalanda College Colombo first XI cricket team in 1994. He developed his talents through the school cricket team, eventually becoming captain. He was runner-up for the best schoolboy cricketer award during the 1994 cricketing season.

Domestically he has played for Sinhalese Sports Club since 1995. He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Sinhalese Sports Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament. He was signed to play as an overseas player for Derbyshire for the first half of the 2008 English cricket season. However, his commitments to Sri Lanka and involvement in the Indian Premier League prevented him from playing any part in the 2008 county season.

== International career ==

===Career in the 1990s===
Mahela Jayawardene is the 69th Sri Lanka Test Cap, having made his debut against India at Colombo in 1997. Jayawardene made his Test debut in the record breaking Test in 1997 against India at R.P.S., Colombo. Jayawardene added 66 to Sri Lanka&#x27;s first innings score of 952/6, the highest Test score ever. He was at the crease when the previous highest Test score was surpassed. Early in his career he scored 167 against New Zealand and 242 against India.

Jayawardene&#x27;s One Day International debut was against Zimbabwe at Premadasa in January 1998. Sri Lanka won the match, with Jayawardene hitting the winning run. In the next game Jayawardene scored 74. It took only 11 matches before he scored his first century, which was against England in the Carlton and United World Series game at Adelaide. Jayawardene entered a pressure situation, with Sri Lanka struggling at 134/4 in the run chase, but made an innings of 120 runs to win the match. The match is notable for Ross Emerson&#x27;s no-balling of Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing, which led the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team to the edge of the field and consider walking out of the match, as well as physical shoulder-barging by some players.

===Captaincy===
Jayawardene was the captain of the Sri Lankan national team during the England tour in 2006 in the absence of Marvan Atapattu. He led his team to 1–1 draw in the Test series and an emphatic 5–0 whitewash in the ODI series.

In the first Test of the 2006 Test series against South Africa, Jayawardene shared a world record partnership of 624 runs alongside Kumar Sangakkara. This partnership, the highest for any wicket in first-class cricket history, and the first instance of a stand of 600 or more in a first-class or Test match innings, smashed the previous third wicket stand for Sri Lanka, surpassing 262 which involved himself along with Thilan Samaraweera. It also broke the previous record for the third wicket partnership for all Test playing nations surpassing the 467 run partnership made by the New Zealanders Martin Crowe and Andrew Jones. During this innings, Jayawardene became the first Sri Lankan captain to score a Test triple-century, making 374 off 572 deliveries with 43 fours and 1 six, the fourth highest individual innings score in Test match cricket and the highest by a right-hander. He is also the first batsman to pass 350 in a Test without going on to break the world record. He also surpassed the highest score by a Sri Lankan in a Test match, previously held by Sanath Jayasuriya&#x27;s 340 in 1997 against India, coincidentally also produced in a world record partnership.

For his performances in 2006, he was named as captain of the World ODI XI by the ICC. He was also named in the World ODI XI by ESPNcricinfo for 2007.

He was also chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2007. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Jayawardene scored one century and four half-centuries and was the second highest run-scorer of the tournament, which was topped by Australia&#x27;s Matthew Hayden. The century he scored against New Zealand helped Sri Lanka win the Semi-Final. Sri Lanka finished runners-up in the World Cup losing to Australia in the final. His knock was named as the third-best ODI Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. He is the only batsman in World Cup ODI history to score hundreds in both a semi final and a final of the tournament. He achieved this feat, by scoring a century in 2007 Cricket World Cup semi final against New Zealand, and a century in 2011 Cricket World Cup final against India. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 World Cup.

He has scored centuries against all Test-playing nations. He achieved this feat on 21 February 2009 by scoring his maiden Test century against Pakistan at the National Stadium in Karachi, Pakistan.

Jayawardene is the recipient of International Cricket Council&#x27;s &quot;Captain of the Year 2006&quot;, Captain of the &quot;World One-Day International Team of the Year 2006&quot;, Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2007, and the record holder for the highest score (374 runs) by a Sri Lankan in Test cricket. He also led Sri Lanka when the team won the &quot;Spirit of Cricket Award&quot; in 2007 and 2008. For his performances in 2008, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

Jayawardene led Sri Lanka to Pakistan for a Test series in March–April 2009. The series was conducted after the Indian team withdrew from playing in Pakistan, following the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The first Test ended in a draw, even though he scored a double century in the first Test. Sri Lanka was in a good position in the Test with Thilan Samaraweera hitting his second successive double hundred of the series and Tillakaratne Dilshan scoring a century.

On their way to the Gaddafi Stadium for the third day&#x27;s play, the bus that carried the Sri Lankan players was fired at by 12 masked gunmen. Jayawardene, along with six other Sri Lankan cricketers, sustained injuries. Six policemen who guarded the bus and two civilians were killed in the attack.

Jayawardene was appointed vice-captain of the Sri Lankan team once again under Kumar Sangakkara after Muttiah Muralitharan retired from Test cricket, but resigned after the team&#x27;s World Cup defeat. He was appointed as captain again after Tillakaratne Dilshan resigned from the captaincy in 2012. He was the captain of Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the Indian Premier League and the Delhi Daredevils. He won the Spirit of Cricket Award 2013.

===Post-captaincy===

However, he regained some form during the IPL 2010. Before starting their chase of 201 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders, Jayawardene expressed his desire to open the innings to captain Kumar Sangakkara. Sangakkara agreed to his fellow countrymate and Jayawardene scored a blazing 110* off just 59 balls winning them the match in the second last over. Sangakkara, impressed by his teammate set him as opener for the Kings XI Punjab. He scored a few more entertaining knocks in vain including 44 against the Rajasthan Royals and 93* against the Deccan Chargers. He ended the tournament with a batting average of 43.90. He was the 6th highest run scorer for the tournament and highest for the Kings XI Punjab.
With Kumar Sangakkara as the Sri Lankan captain too, Jaywardene was sent as opener for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In the first match against New Zealand, he scored 81 off just 51 balls. However, this knock went in vain due to the collapse in the Sri Lankan batting line-up after his wicket fell which resulted in a total of only 135 on board batting first. However, in his very next match against Zimbabwe, he scored 100 off just 64 balls helping them win the match helping them win the match defending a total of 173. He thus became the 4th player to score a century in an Twenty20 International match and the first Sri Lankan to do so. Sri Lanka won the match by D/L method. In the very next match against West Indies, he scored 98* off just 56 balls narrowly missing his second century in a row. This became his third consecutive score above 80.

He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; for the 2011 World Cup by the ICC.

His knock of 103* against India in the 2011 World Cup Final at Mumbai was nominated to be one of the best ODI batting performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ESPNcricinfo.

During the second Test of Sri Lanka&#x27;s tour of South Africa in 2011–12, Jayawardene became the ninth player in cricket history, and the first Sri Lankan, to score 10,000 Test runs. At the end of the tour he was reappointed as Sri Lanka&#x27;s captain, following the resignation of Tillakaratne Dilshan.

His knock of 180 against England at Galle was also nominated to be one of the best Test batting performance of the year 2012 by ESPNcricinfo.

Jayawardene led Sri Lanka to the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 against the West Indies on home turf. Having restricted the West Indies to 137/6, Sri Lanka were steadily making progress in chasing down the target with Jayawardene well set. Halfway through their innings, captain Jayawardene noticed that the West Indies were slightly ahead on Duckworth/Lewis with a hint of rain in the air. He subsequently decided to accelerate the innings, but this only triggered a collapse. The rain never came and Sri Lanka fell a long way short of the target. He resigned as Sri Lanka&#x27;s T20 captain after the match and in 2014 also announced his retirement from T20 cricket. He was selected in the 2nd XI of the 2014 ICC World T20 Cup by ESPNcricinfo.

He was named as captain of the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; for the 2012 T20 World Cup by the ICC.

He holds the record for the most catches in ODIs, taking 218 catches in 448 matches.

He also holds the record for the most runs in Twenty20 World Cups having scored 858 runs in 25 innings, at an average of 40.8 runs per inning, in the four ICC World Twenty20 tournaments held to date (2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012).

On 31 March 2016, it was announced that Jayawaradene has signed for Somerset County Cricket to represent them in the English T20 league.

===Retirement===
On 25 February 2014 in an Asia Cup fixture against Pakistan, Jayawardene became only the second cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar to appear in 600 international matches.

On 14 July 2014, Jayawardene announced his retirement from Test cricket after the 2014 Pakistan series. He played his final Test at his favourite ground, the Sinhalese Sports Club, where he scored 54 runs in his last test innings. The ground was replete with thousands of tributes. Russell Arnold quipped that &quot;Legends never retire&quot;.
His last One-Day innings in Sri Lanka was played on 13 December 2014 in the last match of England ODI series. He was caught on 28 in his last innings on home soil. Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews gave him the ball to take the final wicket. He got his 8th ODI wicket by dismissing James Tredwell through a stumping, with Sangakkara behind the stumps. He along with Sangakkara announced that they would retire from T20I cricket after the 2014 ICC T20 World Cup and was eventually part of Sri Lanka&#x27;s triumph at the 2014 T20 World Cup which was also Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ICC World Twenty20 title.
On 11 January 2015, he scored his 18th ODI century against New Zealand. This was his first ODI century in New Zealand in his 17-year-long ODI career.

During a match against Australia at the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, Jayawardene became the most capped player for Sri Lanka in ODIs, passing Jayasuriya&#x27;s 445 ODI matches.

Jayawardene&#x27;s last ODI was the quarter final of the 2015 World Cup, played against South Africa. He only scored 4 runs and Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the semi-finals for the first time since 1999.

<text>Robert M. Nalbandyan (, 1937–2002) was an Armenian chemist, the co-discoverer of photosynthetic protein plantacyanin, a pioneer in the field of free radicals, and a noted and prolific writer on various subjects in the field of chemistry.

Born in Yerevan, Armenia and educated at Moscow State University in Moscow, Russia, Nalbandyan lived and worked in Yerevan for most of his life, where he also headed a laboratory and lectured. He was recognized as one of Soviet Union&#x27;s most prominent chemists, and in his research collaborated with fellow chemists in the USSR, US, Europe, and Australia. When the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic struck for independence in 1989, Nalbandyan became a prominent critic of the nationalist movement, which he felt was foolhardy and was merely agitating the people for political gain. The energy shortage, economic woes, and virtual blockade experienced after independence seemed to justify his concerns. In 1996 he left the country and emigrated to the United States.

Primarily known in the scientific community for his research work with proteins, Nalbandyan was also recognized among his fellow scientists as a progressive thinker in other fields of chemistry, including neurochemistry.

<doc id="1160693" wikidata="Q1364972" url="?curid=1160693" title="Intermarium">
<text>Intermarium (, ) was a post-World War I geopolitical plan conceived by Józef Piłsudski to unite former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lands within a single polity. The plan went through several iterations, some of which anticipated the inclusion of neighbouring states. The proposed multinational polity would have incorporated territories lying between the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic Seas, hence the name &quot;Intermarium&quot; (Latin for &quot;Between-Seas&quot;).

Prospectively a federation of Central and Eastern European countries, the post-World War I Intermarium plan pursued by Piłsudski sought to recruit to the proposed federation the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The Polish name &quot;Międzymorze&quot; (from &quot;między&quot;, &quot;between&quot;; and &quot;morze&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;), meaning &quot;Between-Seas&quot;, was rendered into Latin as Intermarium.

The proposed federation was meant to emulate the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, that, from the end of the 16th century to the end of the 18th, had united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Intermarium complemented Piłsudski&#x27;s other geopolitical vision, Prometheism, whose goal was the dismemberment of the Russian Empire and that Empire&#x27;s divestment of its territorial acquisitions.

Intermarium was perceived by some Lithuanians as a threat to their newly established independence, and by some Ukrainians as a threat to their aspirations for independence, and while France backed the proposal, it was opposed by the Soviet Union and by most other Western powers. Within two decades of the failure of Piłsudski&#x27;s grand scheme, all the countries that he had viewed as candidates for membership in the Intermarium federation had fallen to the Soviet Union or to Nazi Germany, except for Finland (which suffered some territorial losses in the 1939–40 Winter War with the Soviet Union).

==Precedents==

===Commonwealth===

A Polish–Lithuanian union and military alliance had come about as a mutual response to common threats posed by the Teutonic Order, the Golden Horde, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The alliance was first established in 1385 by the Union of Krewo, solemnized by the marriage of Poland&#x27;s Queen Jadwiga and Lithuania&#x27;s Grand Duke Jogaila of the Gediminid dynasty, who became King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland.

A longer-lasting federation subsequently came about in 1569 in the form of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, an arrangement that lasted until 1795, i.e., until the Third Partition of the Poland.

The Polish–Lithuanian alliance thus lasted a total of 410 years, and constituted at times the largest state in Europe.

Under the Commonwealth, proposals were advanced to establish expanded, Polish–Lithuanian-&quot;Muscovite&quot; or Polish–Lithuanian–&quot;Ruthenian&quot; Commonwealths. Though the Commonwealth temporarily controlled parts of Russia and governed much of Ruthenia for centuries, these proposals were never implemented at a constitutional level.

===Adam Czartoryski&#x27;s plan===
Between the November and January Uprisings, in the period between 1832 and 1861, the idea of resurrecting an updated Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was advocated by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, residing in exile at the Hôtel Lambert in Paris.

In his youth, Czartoryski had fought against Russia in the Polish–Russian War of 1792; he would have done so again in the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794 had he not been arrested at Brussels on his way back to Poland. Subsequently, in 1795, he and his younger brother had been commanded to enter the Imperial Russian Army, and Catherine the Great had been so favourably impressed with them that she had restored to them part of their confiscated estates. Adam Czartoryski subsequently served the Russian emperors Paul and Alexander I as a diplomat and foreign minister, establishing an anti-French coalition during the Napoleonic Wars. Czartoryski, one of the leaders of the Polish November 1830 Uprising, had been sentenced to death after its suppression by Russia, but was eventually allowed to go into exile in France.

In Paris the &quot;visionary&quot; statesman and former friend, confidant, and &quot;de facto&quot; foreign minister of Alexander I acted as the &quot;uncrowned king and unacknowledged foreign minister&quot; of a nonexistent Poland.

In his book, &quot;Essai sur la diplomatie&quot; (Essay on Diplomacy), completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Czartoryski observed that, &quot;Having extended her sway south and west, and being by the nature of things unreachable from the east and north, Russia becomes a source of constant threat to Europe.&quot; He argued that Russia would have done better cultivating &quot;friends rather than slaves&quot;. He also identified a future threat from Prussia and urged the incorporation of East Prussia into a resurrected Poland.

Czartoryski&#x27;s diplomatic efforts anticipated Piłsudski&#x27;s Prometheist project in linking efforts for Polish independence with similar movements of other subjugated nations in Europe, as far east as the Caucasus Mountains, most notably in Georgia.

Czartoryski aspired above all to reconstitute—with French, British, and Ottoman support—a sort of &quot;pan-Slavic&quot; Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth federated with the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians, and all the South Slavs of the future Yugoslavia. Poland, in his concept, could have mediated the conflicts between Hungary and the Slavs, and between Hungary and Romania. The plan seemed achievable during the period of national revolutions in 1848–49 but foundered on lack of western support, on Hungarian intransigence toward the Czechs, Slovaks, and Romanians, and on the rise of German nationalism.

Marian Kamil Dziewanowski writes that &quot;the Prince&#x27;s endeavour constitutes a [vital] link [between] the 16th-century Jagiellon [federative prototype] and Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s federative-Prometheist program [that was to follow after World War I].&quot;

==Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s &quot;Międzymorze&quot;==
Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s strategic goal was to resurrect an updated, democratic form of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while working for the disintegration of the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, into its ethnic constituents. (The latter was his Prometheist project.) Piłsudski saw an Intermarium federation as a counterweight to Russian and German imperialism.

According to Dziewanowski, the plan was never expressed in systematic fashion but instead relied on Piłsudski&#x27;s pragmatic instincts. According to British scholar George Sanford, about the time of the Polish–Soviet War of 1920 Piłsudski recognised that the plan was not feasible.

===Opposition===
Piłsudski&#x27;s plan faced opposition from virtually all quarters. The Soviets, whose sphere of influence was directly threatened, worked to thwart the Intermarium agenda. The Allied Powers assumed that Bolshevism was only a temporary threat and did not want to see their important (from the balance-of-power viewpoint) traditional ally, Russia, weakened. They resented Piłsudski&#x27;s refusal to aid their White allies, viewed Piłsudski with suspicion, saw his plans as unrealistic, and urged Poland to confine itself to areas of clear-cut Polish ethnicity. The Lithuanians, who had re-established their independence in 1918, were unwilling to join; the Ukrainians, similarly seeking independence, likewise feared that Poland might again subjugate them; and the Belarusians, though nearly not as interested in independence as Ukraine, were still fearful of Polish domination. The chances for Piłsudski&#x27;s scheme were not enhanced by a series of post-World War I wars and border conflicts between Poland and its neighbors in disputed territories—the Polish–Soviet War, the Polish–Lithuanian War, the Polish–Ukrainian War, and border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia.

Piłsudski&#x27;s concept was opposed within Poland itself, where National Democracy leader Roman Dmowski argued for an ethnically homogeneous Poland in which minorities would be Polonised. Many Polish politicians, including Dmowski, opposed the idea of a multiethnic federation, preferring instead to work for a unitary Polish nation state. Sanford has described Piłsudski&#x27;s policies after his resumption of power in 1926 as similarly focusing on the Polonisation of the country&#x27;s Eastern Slavic minorities and on the centralisation of power.

While some scholars accept at face value the democratic principles claimed by Piłsudski for his federative plan, others view such claims with skepticism, pointing out a coup d&#x27;état in 1926 when Piłsudski assumed nearly dictatorial powers. In particular, his project is viewed unfavourably by most Ukrainian historians, with Oleksandr Derhachov arguing that the federation would have created a greater Poland in which the interests of non-Poles, especially Ukrainians, would have received short shrift.

Some historians hold that Piłsudski, who argued that &quot;There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine&quot;, may have been more interested in splitting Ukraine from Russia than in assuring Ukrainians&#x27; welfare. He did not hesitate to use military force to expand Poland&#x27;s borders to Galicia and Volhynia, crushing a Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in disputed territories east of the Bug River which contained a substantial Polish presence (a Polish majority mainly in cities such as Lwów, surrounded by a rural Ukrainian majority).

Speaking of Poland&#x27;s future frontiers, Piłsudski said: &quot;All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany&quot;, while in the east &quot;there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far&quot;. In the eastern chaos, the Polish forces set out to expand as far as feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no interest in joining the western intervention in the Russian Civil War or in conquering Russia itself.

===Failure===
In the aftermath of the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), and the establishment of the Ukrainian SSR, Piłsudski&#x27;s concept of a federation of Central and Eastern European countries, based on a Polish-Ukrainian axis, lost any chance of realisation.

Piłsudski next contemplated a federation or alliance with the Baltic and Balkan states. This plan envisioned a Central European union including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Finland, the Baltic states, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece—thus stretching not only west-east from the Baltic to the Black Sea, but north-south from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. This project also failed: Poland was distrusted by Czechoslovakia and Lithuania; and while it had relatively good relations with the other countries, they had tensions with their neighbors, making it virtually impossible to create in Central Europe a large block of countries that all had good relations with each other. In the end, in place of a large federation, only a Polish–Romanian alliance was established, beginning in 1921. In comparison, Czechoslovakia had more success with its Little Entente (1920–1938) with Romania and Yugoslavia, supported by France. 

Piłsudski died in 1935. A later, much reduced version of his concept was attempted by interwar Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, a protégé of Piłsudski. His proposal, during the late 1930s, of a &quot;Third Europe&quot;—an alliance of Poland, Romania, and Hungary—gained little ground before World War II supervened. Beck&#x27;s Third Europe concept failed to achieve any traction because Germany was the world&#x27;s second largest economy and all of eastern Europe was dominated economically by the &quot;Reich&quot;. For economic reasons, the tendency in eastern Europe was to follow the lead of Berlin rather than Warsaw.

Disregarding the 1932 Polish–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet Union allied itself with Nazi Germany to divide Central and Eastern Europe between them. According to some historians, it was the failure to create a strong counterweight to Germany and the Soviet Union, as proposed by Piłsudski, that doomed Intermarium&#x27;s prospective member countries to their fates in World War II.

==World War II and after==

The concept of a &quot;Central [and Eastern] European Union&quot;—a triangular geopolitical entity anchored in the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic or Aegean Seas—was revived during World War II in Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s Polish Government-in-Exile. 

A first step toward its implementation—1942 discussions among the Greek, Yugoslav, Polish, and Czechoslovak governments-in- exile regarding prospective Greek–Yugoslav and Polish–Czechoslovak federations—ultimately foundered on Soviet opposition, which led to Czech hesitation and Allied indifference or hostility. 

A declaration by the Polish Underground State in that period called for the creation of a Central and Eastern European federal union undominated by any one state.

On 12 May 2011, the Visegrád Group countries (The Republic of Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Hungary) announced the formation of a Visegrád Battlegroup under Polish command. The battlegroup was in place by 2016 as an EU force, not part of the NATO command. In addition, starting in 2013, the four countries were to begin joint military exercises under the auspices of the NATO Response Force. Some scholars saw this as a first step toward close Central European regional cooperation.

On 6 August 2015, Polish President Andrzej Duda, in his inaugural address, announced plans to build a regional alliance of Central European states, modeled on the Intermarium concept. In 2016 the Three Seas Initiative held an initial summit meeting in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The Three Seas Initiative has 12 member states along a north–south axis from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

<doc id="1160696" wikidata="Q991069" url="?curid=1160696" title="Brown Palace Hotel (Denver)">
<text>The Brown Palace Hotel, now The Brown Palace Hotel and Spa, Autograph Collection, is a historic hotel in Denver, Colorado, United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the second-longest operating hotel in Denver. It is one of the first atrium-style hotels ever built. It is now operated by HEI Hotels and Resorts, and joined Marriott&#x27;s Autograph Collection Hotels in 2012. The hotel is located at 321 17th Street between 17th Street, Broadway and Tremont Place in downtown Denver behind the Republic Plaza. The main entrance door is on Tremont Place. The Brown Palace Hotel, now The Brown Palace Hotel and Spa, Autograph Collection is member of Historic Hotels of America (a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation) since 2023.

==History==
The hotel was built in 1892 of sandstone and red granite, one year later than the Oxford Hotel. It was named for its original owner, Henry C. Brown, who had homesteaded the Capitol Hill area, and was designed with its distinctive triangular shape by architect Frank Edbrooke, who also designed the Oxford Hotel. The interior and the exterior of the building are considered to be the &quot;finest extant example&quot; of Edbrooke&#x27;s work.

Built with an iron and steel frame covered with cement and sandstone by the Whitehouse &amp; Wirgler Stone Company, the building was &quot;one of America&#x27;s first fireproof structures, according to a May 21, 1892 cover story in &quot;Scientific American.&quot;&quot; Upon its completion it was Denver&#x27;s tallest building.

In the early 1930s Colorado muralist Allen Tupper True began discussing the possibility of creating two murals for the hotel with then owner Denver financier Charles Boettcher and after some delay the two works, &quot;Stage Coach&quot; and &quot;Airplane Travel&quot; were unveiled in the hotel&#x27;s lobby in 1937.

In 1935, as a celebration of the Repeal of Prohibition in the United States, Denver architect Alan Fisher designed &quot;Ship Tavern&quot;; one of four restaurants inside The Brown Palace.

==Annex==
The 22-story, 231-room tower directly across Tremont Place was built as a new wing of the hotel in 1959, known as the Brown Palace West. For many years it operated as a budget wing of the hotel, until the Brown Palace&#x27;s owners branded the guest rooms in the annex as a Comfort Inn in 1988, and then as a Holiday Inn Express in December 2014. The lower levels of the tower are shared with the Brown Palace, including the Grand Ballroom and executive offices. The tower is connected to the main building by a skybridge over Tremont Place and a service tunnel running under the street.

==Past guests==
Past guests include the &quot;Unsinkable&quot; Molly Brown (she stayed at the hotel only a week after the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster), infamous Denver crime boss Jefferson &quot;Soapy&quot; Smith, Dr. Sun Yat Sen (just before becoming the president of the new Republic of China), Denver Socialite Louise Sneed Hill, Queen Marie of Romania, John Wayne, and The Beatles. Presidential guests include William Taft, Warren Harding, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. John Galen Locke passed away there 1935 while at a political meeting.

==Murders of 1911==
The hotel was the site of the high-profile 1911 murders in which Frank Henwood shot and killed Sylvester Louis &quot;Tony&quot; von Phul, and accidentally killed an innocent bystander, George Copeland, in the hotel&#x27;s &quot;Marble Bar.&quot; Henwood and von Phul were rivals for (or shared) the affections of Denver socialite Isabel Springer, the wife of wealthy Denver businessman and political candidate John W. Springer. The murders culminated in a series of very public trials.

==Popular culture==
In Joan Didion&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;A Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the narrator, Grace Strasser-Mendana, lives at the Brown Palace after her parents&#x27; deaths.

The hotel features in the 2017 Jane Fonda and Robert Redford film &quot;Our Souls at Night&quot;. 

It features in the time travel novel “Warm Souls” - Part 2 of the “Wealth of Time” series by Andre Gonzalez. The Brown Palace is featured on many of Denver&#x27;s cultural tours.

<doc id="1160699" wikidata="Q902325" url="?curid=1160699" title="Tsonga people">
<text>The Tsonga people () are a Bantu ethnic group primarily native to Southern Mozambique and South Africa (Limpopo and Mpumalanga). They speak Xitsonga, a Southern Bantu language.
A very small number of Tsonga people are also found in Zimbabwe and Northern Eswatini. The Tsonga people of South Africa share some history with the Tsonga people of Southern Mozambique, and have similar cultural practices, but differ in the dialects spoken.

==History==

The Vatsonga people are native to Southern Africa (Parts of South Africa and Mozambique). One of the earliest reputable written accounts of the Tsonga people is by Henri Philipe (HP) Junod titled &quot;&quot;Matimu ya Vatsonga 1498–1650&quot; which was formally published in 1977, and it speaks of the earliest Tsonga kingdoms. Before this, the older Henri-Alexandre Junod released his work &quot;The life of a South African Tribe&quot;&quot; which was first published under two volumes in 1912–1913 and re-published in 1927. Early tribes identified are names such as the Mpfumo who belong to the Rhonga clan within the wider Tsonga (Thonga) ethnicity, and further identified during the 1500–1650 are the Valenga, Vacopi, Vatonga (Nyembana), Vatshwa, and Vandzawu.

They held large territorial areas in southern Mozambique and parts of South Africa and extracted tribute for those who passed through (paying tribute was to secure passage or to be spared from attack). The Tsonga tribes also operated like a confederacy in supplying regiments to different groups in the northern Transvaal region during times of Great Zimbabwe establishment and engaged in trade. Typical examples during the 1800s are the Nkuna and Valoyi tribes which supplied soldiers to help the Modjadji kingdom; and the Nkomati and Mabunda tribes for supplying regiments to the army of Joao Albasini. The Tsonga people have an age-old custom of leading their own tribes, with a senior traditional leader at the forefront of their own tribal establishment and is seen with a status equal to that of a king. The Tsonga people have lived according to these customs for ages and they hold the belief that &quot;vukosi a byi peli nambu&quot; which is a metaphor meaning &quot;kingship does not cross territorial or family borders&quot;.

Within apartheid South Africa, a Tsonga &quot;homeland&quot;, Gazankulu Bantustan, was created out of part of northern Transvaal Province (Now Limpopo Province and Mpumalanga) during the 1960s and was granted self-governing status in 1973. This bantustan&#x27;s economy depended largely on gold and on a small manufacturing sector. However, only an estimated 500,000 people—less than half the Tsonga population of South Africa—ever lived there. Many others joined township residents from other parts of South Africa around urban centres, especially Johannesburg and Pretoria.

==Name==
The Constitution of South Africa stipulates that all South Africans have a right to identify with their own language, and points out that tribal affiliations or &quot;ethnicity&quot; is identifiable mostly through a common language; hence the recognition of groups such as, for example the Xhosas who are united by isiXhosa; Zulus who are united by isiZulu; Vendas who are united by Tshivenda; and the Sothos who are united by Sesotho. The various groups who speak the Xitsonga language or one of its dialects are therefore also united by the language and take its name from it, hence Constitutionally they are the Tsonga people (Vatsonga).
There are also other Tsonga groups in parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Eswatini. Other related groups outside of South Africa who are ancestral or related to the South African Tsonga people go by various tribal names (e.g., Tonga, Rhonga, Chopi, Tswa) but they are sometimes classified within the heritage and history of the Tsonga people of South Africa.

==Language==

The Tsonga people speak the Xitsonga language, which is one of the official languages of the Republic of South Africa. According to historians, the Xitsonga language had already developed during the 1500s with its predecessor the &quot;Thonga language&quot; identified as the main origin.
It was mostly through the missionary work of the late 1800s to mid-1900s that led to a cohesive study of the Tsonga people&#x27;s dialects and language features. The work carried out by Henri Junod and his father left a lasting legacy for the Tsonga people to rediscover their past history. It was however Paul Berthoud and his companion Ernest Creux who actively engaged with the Tsonga people of the Spelonken region to eventually produce the first hymn books written in the Xitsonga language at around 1878. These Swiss Missionaries, however, did not understand the Xitsonga language at all and had to depend on the guidance of native speakers for the translations. The first book written in the Xitsonga language was published in 1883 by Paul Berthoud after dedicating enough time to learning the language. The Tsonga people themselves had then begun to learn to read and write in Xitsonga, however that the Tsonga people had already been well affluent in the Xitsonga language or one of its dialects long before the arrival of the Swiss Missionaries. There is evidence to indicate that the &quot;language was already-spoken by the primitive occupants of the country more than 500 years&quot; before the arrival of Swiss Missionaries. (Junod 1912, p. 32)

==Conflicts and naming conventions==

The name &quot;Tsonga&quot; or &quot;Vatsonga&quot; itself is properly related to the older &quot;Thonga&quot; (also spelled as Tonga in some instances). The Thonga people are one of the original African tribes who left Central Africa between 200AD and 500AD and gave birth to many cultural identities in Southern Africa. The name &quot;Thonga&quot; has various meanings in different languages. In the Shona language it means &quot;people of the river&quot;, or &quot;independent&quot;; in isiZulu it means &quot;spirit medium&quot;, &quot;stick&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;, or &quot;the prestigious ones&quot;. The Thonga people settled at various parts of southern Africa and thus different cultural identities were born who still identify with a common heritage. The Tembe people of KwaZulu-Natal, for example, still praise themselves as &quot;amaThonga&quot; but are now a part of the Zulu language and culture after being integrated in northern KwaZulu Natal. The Rhonga people were identified according to the eastern direction from which they lived (Rhonga means East in the Rhonga dialect) and they included the tribes of Mpfumo of Nhlaruti, Nondwane, Vankomati, and Mabota. Another example is the Valenge and Chopi people (vaCopi) of Gunyule and Dzavana who are also related to the Tsonga people of South Africa such as the Maluleke, Shivambu, Mhinga, and Mulamula, and still regard themselves as part of the larger Thonga/Tonga group. The tribes often identified as the Gwamba (properly the descendants of Gwambe) such as the tribes of Baloyi, Mathebula, and Nyai, also formed the Kalanga and Rozwi tribes. Other tribes include the Hlengwe people who are descended from those who called themselves Vatswa (sometimes spelled Tshwa) and also the Khosa who identified with the Djonga and Mbai sub-group. Indeed, most of the Tsonga people of South Africa are descended from breakaway groups of the Thonga which must have happened around the 1600s with the dawn of the arrival of the Portuguese in Mozambique.

In South Africa the name &quot;Shangaan&quot; or &quot;Machangane&quot; is regularly applied to the entire Tsonga population; however, this is a common misconception and others even take offense to it with regards to tribal affiliation. What can be identified as the Shangaan tribe only forms a small fraction of the entire Tsonga ethnic group, meaning that the term &quot;Shangaan&quot; should only be applied to that tribe which is directly related to Soshangane ka Zikode (a Nguni general from the Ndwandwe tribe) who came to power during the 1800s, as well as those tribes which were founded or assimilated directly by him. In contrast, the Tsonga ethnic group comprises various tribal identities, some of which have been recognised and well established in Mozambique and South Africa even back around 1350 all the way through the 1600s to 1900s, namely the Varhonga, Vaxika, Vahlengwe, Van&#x27;wanati, Vacopi, Valoyi, and others. On the other hand, the double barrel term &quot;Tsonga-Shangaan&quot; is often applied in a way similar to Sotho and Tswana; Pedi and Lobedu; or Xhosa and Mpondo. Historical research shows that a substantial number of Tsonga tribes have been living together in South Africa during the 1400s to 1700s at a time where the name &quot;Shangaan&quot; had not yet existed. Back during the 1640s–1700s the Tsonga people of South Africa were already integrated and living together established under their own traditional leaderships (such as the kingdoms led by Gulukhulu, Xihlomulo of the Valozyi, Maxakadzi of the Van&#x27;wanati, and Ngomani of the Vaxika).

When Soshangane (whom the name &quot;Shangaan&quot; is taken from) and other Nguni invaders raided Mozambique later during the 1820s, the Tsonga people who were already living prior under Dutch colonialism in South Africa did not form a part of the Nguni Shangaan empire (and were often hostile to it) and they had already been speaking the Xitsonga language through dialects such as Xin&#x27;walungu, Xihlanganu, Xidzonga, etc. within the Transvaal. Such Tsonga tribes have never been subjects of the Gaza Shangaan empire and have always retained their senior traditional leadership even during the governance of the Apartheid homeland system. The misconception that they were all united by a single leader appears to be false as most of the people who organised the early Tsonga/Tonga groupings would still be integrated within South Africa even if the Mfecane Nguni wars did not happen. In addition to this, many of the Tsonga tribes who were still in Mozambique and later attacked by Soshangane and other Ndwandwes in the 1820s distanced themselves and fled to the Transvaal to re-establish themselves outside of the influence of the Gaza empire (they refused to be led by the Ngunis), while some remained and were either subjugated or enslaved. Having said that, it is well known that the Gaza Empire was vast and included areas occupied by the Tsonga. Many Tsonga identified themselves as Shangani and there is a wealth of Nguni names and words in their language which testifies of the Gaza Nguni rulership of some of these groups. The Copi people (Chopi) however, remained rebellious and independent throughout the lifetime of the Gaza kingdom and were never properly defeated, and when the ruler of Gaza (Nghunghunyana) invaded their territory near the Limpopo River and attempted to subjugate them in 1888, a war ensued between the Chopi people and the Gaza forces that effectively lasted from 1889 and ended in 1895 when Nghunghunyana was defeated by the Portuguese (led by their general Mouzinho de Albuquerque) in alliance with Chopi soldiers (led by their king Xipenenyana). Many of the Gaza people fled from the disintegrated Empire and its remaining leadership took asylum in South Africa where most of the Tsonga people had been living before the Mfecane wars started. In South Africa, the Gaza-Shangaan people lost their Nguni language which was prevalent within the Empire due largely to the new reality and they adopted the Xitsonga language in the Transvaal but still largely identify with Nguni customs.

In modern South Africa, the integration of such tribes has led to a social cohesion drive where some of the Tsonga people believe they face an identity crisis as a result of perceived tribalism of the Ndwandwe Shangaan tribe against the original Tsonga tribes. Another factor is the Gaza-Shangaan people&#x27;s association with a history of oppression and exploitation that the inhabitants of Mozambique suffered under the rule of the Gaza Empire during the 1800s, which has been well-documented by reliable sources and is a subject of much controversy and debate.

==Clan structures==
The Tsonga ethnic group has been united by the gradual assimilation of various nearing tribes found in abundance within Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa respectively. Historical research indicates that the development of a common language (Xitsonga) as well as cultural integration within the Tsonga ethnic group has been occurring ever since the 1200s (over 800 years ago). It is possible that different conflicting groups sought to establish protection alliances and thus integrated their tribes into a common establishment or to secure trade. Language appears to be the dominant factor in uniting the Tsonga tribes, similarly to the Venda people who are also of various tribes united by the Venda language. The Tembe nation is probably one of the most influential in the east coast and one of the first people to settle in the northern parts of Kwazulu natal and southern Mozambique, and various clans like the Dlamini, Gumedes, mashabanes, Matshinyes, Nyakas To mention a few identify themselves with Tembe nations or being identical with the Tembe. One of earliest Northern Tsonga kingdom within South African territory was located in between the confluence of Levhuvhu River and Shingwedzi River from the late 1600s was the Mhinga Dynasty, who founded Malamulele (the Rescuer) and further formed the leadership of the Gazankulu territorial authority around the 1960s in what is today the eastern parts of the Limpopo province. The Van&#x27;wanati clan according to Henry A. Junod (1912) are also the ones who re-assimilated the Baloyi and Vanyayi clans who left the Kalanga country and became Tsonga-speaking. However the Baloyi were part of the original Thonga cluster of clans (through their ancestor Gwambe) before they went to conquer parts of Zimbabwe and were nicknamed as Barozwi (&quot;the destroyers&quot;). The Tsonga people themselves still recognize their respective tribal origins and have also embraced the Tsonga national identity, which unites them linguistically and culturally within South Africa. The biggest factor in uniting the various Xitsonga-speaking tribes in South African territory is the role played by Sunduza II of the Mhinga Dynasty in 1961 where he mobilized all the Tsonga chiefs to form a territorial authority that enabled the Tsonga people to retain their own recognition equal to the Venda and Pedi territorial authorities (Mathebula 2002, p. 37). Sunduza II Mhinga, a descendant of Dzavana and the king of the Chopi people Gunyule, began his pursuits to unite the Tsonga clans in the 1950s when the apartheid government attempted to assimilate the Tsonga and Shangaan people into the Venda and Pedi Bantustans. Sunduza II then called a meeting for all the leading Tsonga chiefs in 1957 and made a resolution to unite and resist the impending assimilation. The leadership by Sunduza II resulted in the apartheid government engaging in diplomatic talks which unilaterally granted the Tsonga people recognition to form their own territorial authority. This greatly cemented the unity between the Tsonga and Shangaan people from the formation of the Gazankulu Homeland where Hudson Ntsanwisi (a member of the Van&#x27;wanati Maluleke clan) became the first Chief Minister of the Tsonga and Shangaan people.

Some historical clans were named after the chief believed to be the original ancestor. The clan name served as a family name in order to eternalize it so it is not forgotten. This differs from the Pedi tribes residing in the area who were totemic, often being named after animals. 

Xitsonga-speaking communities of South Africa after 1890 (through a Xitsonga-related dialect or sub dialect):

* Vatsonga (Thonga, Tsonga)
* Amashangana (Ngoni, Ndwandwe)
* Mbayi Tribe(Khoseni, Nkuna)
* Mazibuko tribe(Mabunda, Maswanganyi)
*Ndau Tribe(Ndlozi, Sithole)

==Population==
In total, there were 7.3 million Tsonga speakers in 2011, divided mainly between South Africa and Mozambique. South Africa was home to 3.3 million Tsonga speakers in the 2011 population census, while Mozambique accounted for 4 million speakers of the language. A small insignificant number of speakers included 15,000 Tsonga speakers in Eswatini and roughly 18,000 speakers in Zimbabwe.

In South Africa, Tsonga people were concentrated in the following municipal areas during the 2011 population census: Greater Giyani Local Municipality (248,000 people), Bushbuckridge Local Municipality (320,000 people), Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality (195,000 people), Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality (80,000 people), Makhado Local Municipality (170,000 people), Thulamela Local Municipality (220,000 people), City of Tshwane (280,000 people), City of Johannesburg (290,000 people), and Ekurhuleni (260,000 people). In the following municipalities, Tsonga people are present but they are not large enough or are not significant enough to form a dominant community in their shere of influence, in most cases, they are less than 50,000 people in each municipality. At the same time, they are not small enough to be ignored as they constitute the largest minority language group. They are as follows: Greater Letaba Local Municipality (28,00 people), Mbombela Local Municipality (26,000) people, Nkomazi Local Municipality (28,500) people, Mogalakwena Local Municipality (31,400 people), Madibeng Local Municipality (51,000), Moretele Local Municipality (34,000), and Rustenburg Local Municipality (30,000). The provincial breakdown of Tsonga speakers, according to the 2011 census, are as follows: Limpopo Province (1,006,000 people, Mpumalanga Province (415,000 people, Gauteng Province (800,000 people and North West Province (110,000 people. Overall, Tsonga speakers constitutes 4.4% of South Africa&#x27;s total population.

==Economy==
The Tsonga traditional economy is based on mixed agriculture and pastoralism. Cassava is the staple; corn (maize), millet, sorghum, and other crops are also grown. Women do much of the agricultural work, while men and teenage boys take care of domestic animals (a herd of cows, sheep, and goats) although some men grow cash crops. Most Tsongas now have jobs in South Africa and Mozambique.

==Culture==

Tsonga men traditionally attend the initiation school for circumcision called &quot;Ngoma&quot; (eNgomeni), also known as &quot;Hogo&quot;after which they are regarded as men. Young teenage girls attend an initiation school that old Vatsonga women lead called Khomba, and initiates are therefore called tikhomba (khomba- singular, tikhomba- plural). Only virgins are allowed to attend this initiation school where they will be taught more about womanhood, how to carry themselves as tikhomba in the community, and they are also readied for marriage.

The Vatsonga people living along the Limpopo River in South Africa have recently gained a significant amount of attention for their high-tech, lo-fi electronic dance music Xitsonga Traditional and otherwise promoted as Tsonga Disco, electro, and Tsonga ndzhumbha. The more traditional dance music of the Tsonga people was pioneered by the likes of General MD Shirinda, Fanny Mpfumo, Matshwa Bemuda, and Thomas Chauke, while the experimental genres of Tsonga disco and Tsonga ndzhumbha have been popularized by artists such as Joe Shirimani, Penny Penny, Peta Teanet, and Benny Mayengani. The more westernized type of sound which includes a lot of English words, sampled vocals and heavy synthesizers is promoted as Shangaan electro in Europe and has been pioneered by the likes of Nozinja, the Tshetsha Boys, and DJ Khwaya. The Tsonga people are also known for a number of traditional dances such as the Makhwaya, Xighubu, Mchongolo and Xibelani dances.

==Traditional beliefs and healers==


Like most Bantu cultures, the Tsonga people have a strong acknowledgement of their ancestors, who are believed to have a considerable effect on the lives of their descendants. The traditional healers are called n&#x27;anga. Legend has it that the first Tsonga diviners of the South African lowveld were a woman called &quot;Nkomo We Lwandle&quot; (Cow of the Ocean) and a man called &quot;Dunga Manzi&quot; (Stirring Waters). A powerful water serpent, Nzunzu (Ndhzhundzhu), allegedly captured them and submerged them in deep waters. They did not drown, but lived underwater breathing like fish. Once their kin had slaughtered a cow for Nzunzu, they were released and emerged from the water on their knees as powerful diviners with an assortment of potent herbs for healing. &quot;Nkomo We Lwandle&quot; and &quot;Dunga Manzi&quot; became famous healers and trained hundred of women and men as diviners.

Among the Tsongas, symptoms such as persistent pains, infertility and bouts of aggression can be interpreted as signs that an alien spirit has entered a person&#x27;s body. When this occurs, the individual will consult a n&#x27;anga to diagnose the cause of illness. If it has been ascertained that the person has been called by the ancestors to become a n&#x27;anga, they will become a client of a senior diviner who will not only heal the sickness, but also invoke the spirits and train them to become diviners themselves. The legend of the water serpent is re-enacted during the diviner&#x27;s initiation, by ceremoniously submerging the initiates in water from which they emerge as diviners.

The kind of spirits that inhabit a person are identified by the language they speak. There are generally the Ngoni (derived from the word Nguni), the Ndau and the Malopo. The Ndau spirit possesses the descendants of the Gaza soldiers who had slain the Ndau and taken their wives.

Once the spirit has been converted from hostile to benevolent forces, the spirits bestow the powers of divination and healing on the nganga.

<text>The East Somerset Railway is a heritage railway in Somerset, running between Cranmore and Mendip Vale. The railway was once part of the former Cheddar Valley line that ran from Witham to Yatton, meeting the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway at Wells but was considered for closure even before the publication of &#x27;The Reshaping of British Railways&#x27; by Dr Richard Beeching in March 1963.

== History ==
The East Somerset Railway Company was incorporated under the (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. xvi) on 5 June 1856 and was built as a broad gauge line. The line was originally between Witham railway station and Shepton Mallet and this line opened on 9 November 1858. It was planned by Mr. Brunel and built by engineer Mr. Ward and contractor Mr. Brotherwood. The station buildings at Shepton and Witham Friary, as well as the bridges along the route, were constructed of Inferior Oolite from nearby Doulting Stone Quarry. Shepton was now from London by rail, a journey of just over four hours.

Four years later the line was extended to Wells. This part of the line was opened on 1 March 1862 and made it long. The East Somerset Railway was bought by the Great Western Railway on 2 December 1874, shortly after it was converted to .

In 1878, the Great Western Railway (GWR) joined the East Somerset line with the Cheddar Valley line to Wells, which had been built by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, by obtaining running rights over a section of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR) and running its trains through the Wells station at Priory Road, though GWR trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934. At this stage, the main traffic became the through trains from Yatton to Witham and the East Somerset Railway station in Wells closed, with Wells (Tucker Street) becoming the station for the city on the line. The Yatton to Witham service remained in use with the GWR and later British Rail until passenger service finally ceased on 7 September 1963, however trains carrying bitumen continued until 1985.

== Preservation ==
In 1971/72, the artist David Shepherd came across, viewed and later purchased Cranmore station and a section of the track to house and run his two locomotives; the British Rail (BR) 2-10-0 Class 9F No. 92203 &quot;Black Prince&quot; and BR Standard 4 4-6-0 No. 75029 &#x27;The Green Knight&#x27;. In 1973, the line opened offering Brake Van rides before extending first to Merryfield Lane in 1980 (operating from Cranmore West), then to Mendip Vale and finally into Cranmore station itself in 1985.

The East Somerset Railway (ESR) only operates the line between Cranmore, Cranmore West, Merryfield Lane Halt and Mendip Vale. Between the last two sections, the railway runs through the Doulting Railway Cutting Site of Special Scientific Interest. The section between Cranmore and the mainline is used for heavy quarry traffic to the nearby Merehead Quarry.

In 1991, a new station building was constructed at Cranmore which now includes a cafe, booking office, gift shop and toilets. The platform then extends to the old station which is now a museum. On the platform is an old K4 red telephone box which incorporates a stamp machine and post box. It was made around 1927 and is one of only 50 made to that design. Opposite the platform is a signal box dating from 1904 and is the standard GWR pattern of the period. Close to Cranmore station are the engine sheds and workshop (known together as Cranmore Shed) which were built in 1973, (during the preserved line&#x27;s restoration at the time).

Cranmore Traincare and Maintenance and Services (CTMS) was set up in 1995 at the Cranmore base of the ESR. They carry out professional repairs to carriages and bodywork overhauls on diesel locomotives. CTMS is based opposite the ESR loco workshop in a separate preservation era shed.

An order by the Secretary of State for Transport in 2005 allowed a further 660 yards (600 metres) of track to be used.

On 25 March 2007, the East Somerset Railway announced that it had received a £7,500 grant from Shepton 21 Group, a local organisation, set up to regenerate the area around Shepton Mallet. The money was to be spent on conducting a feasibility study into extending the line towards Shepton Mallet, with a possible new terminus at Cannards Grave, on the outskirts of Shepton Mallet.

== Locomotives ==
=== Operational steam locomotives ===
Former resident locomotives include 56xx 5637, 9F 92203 &quot;Black Prince&quot;, Standard 4MT 75029 &quot;The Green Knight&quot;, Standard 4MT 76017, GWR Castle 5029 &quot;Nunney Castle&quot;, SR Westcountry 34027 &#x27;Taw Valley&#x27;, SR West Country 34105 &quot;Swanage&quot;, SR S15 828, GWR Manor 7822 &quot;Foxcote Manor&quot;, GWR 14xx 1450, LBSCR E1 110, LMS 3F 47493, NER J72 69023 &#x27;Joem&#x27; and GNR J52 68846.

=== Steam locomotives under overhaul ===
In recent years, the ESR workshops have restored several locomotives belonging to other railways such as LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T 41313 in 2017 and fellow Ivatt 46447 in 2014 for the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. GWR 5205 Class 5239 &quot;Goliath&quot; was completed for the Dartmouth Steam Railway in November 2019.

===Diesel traction===

The ESR is host to a Class 108 DMU as well as a fleet of Sentinel shunting locomotives, these are listed below:

<doc id="1160702" wikidata="Q7644118" url="?curid=1160702" title="Superprofit">
<text>Superprofit, surplus profit or extra surplus-value () is a concept in Karl Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy subsequently elaborated by Vladimir Lenin and other Marxist thinkers.

== Origin of the concept in Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot; ==
The term superprofit (extra surplus-value) was first used by Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. It refers to above-average enterprise profits, arising in three main situations:
* Technologically advanced firms operating at above average productivity in a competitive growing market.
* Under conditions of declining demand, only firms with above-average productivity would obtain the previous socially average profit rate as the rest would book lower profits.
* Monopolies of resources or technologies, yielding what are effectively land rents, mining rents, or technological rents.

== Lenin&#x27;s interpretation ==
According to Leninism, superprofits are extracted from the workers in colonial (or Third World) countries by the imperialist powers (in the First World). Part of these superprofits are then distributed (in the form of increased living standards) to the workers in the imperialists&#x27; home countries in order to buy their loyalty, achieve political stability and avoid a workers&#x27; revolution, usually by means of reformist labor parties. The workers who receive a large enough share of the superprofits have an interest to defend the capitalist system, so they become a labor aristocracy.

Superprofit in Marxist–Leninist theory is the result of unusually severe exploitation or superexploitation. All capitalist profit in Marxist–Leninist theory is based on exploitation (the business owners extract surplus value from the workers), but superprofit is achieved by taking exploitation above and beyond its normal level. In Marxism–Leninism, there are no profits that could result from an activity or transaction that did not involve exploitation.

== Ernest Mandel&#x27;s theory ==
Ernest Mandel argues in his book &quot;Late Capitalism&quot; that the frontline of capitalist development is always ruled by the search for surplus-profits (above-average returns).

Mandel argues that the growth pattern of modern capitalism is shaped by the quest for surplus-profits in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets in which a few large corporations dominate supply. Thus, the extra or above-average profits do not arise so much from real productivity gains, but from corporations monopolising access to resources, technologies and markets. It is not so much that enterprises with superior productivity outsell competitors, but that competitors are blocked in various ways from competing, for example through cartelisation, mergers, fusions, take-overs, government-sanctioned licensing, exclusive production and selling rights. In that case, the extra profits have less to do with reward for entrepreneurship than with market position and market power, i.e. the ability to offload business costs onto someone else (the state, consumers and other businesses) and force consumers to pay extra for access to the goods and services they buy, based on supply monopolies.

Tibor Palánkai instead argues that while superprofit can be monopolistic profit, abusing monopoly position is regulated by rigorous competition policies in developed democratic countries. Superprofit coming from other sources like comparative advantages or technical innovation contribute to public welfare.

<doc id="1160704" wikidata="Q5126307" url="?curid=1160704" title="Claremont Football Club">
<text>The Claremont Football Club, nicknamed Tigers, is an Australian rules football club based in Claremont, Western Australia, that currently plays in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). Its official colours are navy blue and gold. Formed as the &quot;Cottesloe Beach Football Club&quot; in 1906, the club entering the WAFL in 1925 as the &quot;Claremont-Cottesloe Football Club&quot;&#x27;, changing its name to the present in 1935. Claremont have won 12 senior men&#x27;s premierships since entering the competition, including most recently the 2011 and 2012 premierships.

==History==
===Foundations===
It was formed as the amateur Cottesloe Beach Football Club in 1906, and joined the peak amateur competition, the Western Australian Football Association the following year. The club dominated the WAFA from the outset, winning premierships from 1907 to 1910, and in 1908 it beat WAFL club Subiaco in a challenge match.

Applications by the club to join the WAFL were rejected for many years. In 1919, the Cottesloe Beach club merged with a consortium from Claremont which was also attempting to gain entry to the WAFL and had no contracted players, but claimed to have secured use of the Claremont Showground as a home ground. In 1921, the club was admitted to the WAFL &quot;B&quot; Grade competition, as Claremont-Cottesloe, using the same blue and gold colours as the local swimming club, being finally admitted to the senior league in 1926.

The inaugural captain-coach was former South Fremantle and Richmond player Norm McIntosh, who was the only player with senior experience. McIntosh&#x27;s young squad could only win one game in their first season.

===1927–1960===
In 1927, the club moved to Claremont Oval, where it has been the club&#x27;s home ground, with the exception of 1945 and 1946, where, due to the grandstand burning down in 1944, and the condition of the playing surface, the club shared with Subiaco Oval with the Subiaco Football Club.

Between 1926 and 1935 Claremont won just 40 and drew 2 of 183 games for an overall success rate of 22.4%. The nearest they came to qualifying for the finals was in 1929 when, with 8 wins and 10 defeats, they finished just four points plus percentage behind 4th placed Subiaco. Even when Swan Districts was admitted to the competition in 1934 Claremont-Cottesloe continued to underachieve, ending up with the wooden spoon for the 7th time in 9 seasons.

In 1935 the club officially dropped &#x27;Cottesloe&#x27; from its name, becoming simply &#x27;Claremont&#x27;, and with the return of George Moloney in 1936 following his five seasons with Geelong Football Club in Australian football&#x27;s &#x27;big league&#x27; the VFL Claremont enjoyed its best WANFL season to date, winning 12 and losing 8 of its home and away matches to qualify for the finals in 2nd place. A 5-point 2nd semi final defeat of minor premier East Fremantle Football Club then earned Claremont premiership favouritism, a state of affairs which intensified still further when it was learned that their grand final opponents would not be Old Easts, but the Royals (East Perth Football Club), which had finished the minor round in 4th place, but had surprisingly overturned East Fremantle in the preliminary final by a solitary point. The 1936 WANFL grand final attracted 20,874 spectators to Subiaco Oval, who witnessed East Perth reaching an 11.5 (71) to 9.6 (60) victory.

Claremont again finished runners-up a year later after raising hopes, first by finishing the home and away rounds with a 13–5–1 record to qualify for the finals as minor premiers, and then by overcoming East Fremantle in the 2nd semi final by 14 points. However, when the stakes were raised a fortnight later against the same opponent Claremont was found lacking, eventually going under by 10 points.

In 1938 the club replaced coach Dick Lawn with Johnny Leonard, a former Sandover Medallist, who had already coached successfully at Ballarat, Geelong and West Perth. The club qualified for the finals in 2nd place and scored a 2nd semi final victory over East Fremantle, winning, 17.19 (121) to 13.18 (96). The grand final, again against East Fremantle however resulted in a draw, only the second time in WA(N)FL history. In the subsequent grand final replay Claremont won by 22 points, 14.17 (111) to 11.13 (79), breaking their premiership drought. In 1939, although the club lost the 2nd semi final against East Fremantle, 15.15 to 9.14, it won the preliminary final against East Perth 10.17 (77) to 11.5 (71). In the grand final, again facing East Fremantle, Claremont went on to win 14.11 (95) to 11.10 (76) obtaining its second premiership.

1940 saw Claremont again reach the finals, losing the 2nd semi final against South Fremantle Football Club before the club prevailed against East Fremantle in the preliminary final. In the grand final Claremont went on to beat South Fremantle obtaining their third successive premiership.

Between 1942 and 1944, owing to the demands of World War II, the WANFL operated on a limited, under age only basis and after open age competition returned in 1945 Claremont commenced its longest period in the football wilderness. In 1945 it won only two games and finished last, kicked its lowest score ever against Perth, and had a losing streak of seventeen games into 1946, when it again was last with only three wins. Although it avoided the wooden spoon for the next eleven years, only in 1950 (fifth) and 1952 (fourth by one percent from East Fremantle) did it finish higher than sixth in an eight-team competition in the next seventeen years.

===1961–2000===
After claiming the wooden spoon in 1962 and 1963 Claremont appointed a complete outsider, former East Fremantle rover Jim Conway as coach for 1964. At the end of that season Claremont scraped into the finals in 4th place. The club went on to beat Subiaco in the 1st semi final, which was then followed by a win against the Demons (Perth Football Club) in the preliminary final. Claremont won 14.18 (102) to 15.8 (98) against East Fremantle in the grand final and secured the club&#x27;s fourth premiership. Ian Brewer kicked two late goals to put Claremont ahead. His direct opponent was Norm Rogers, who won the Simpson medal for the game. Rogers suffered cramp in the last minutes of the game and Brewer was able to break free and score the winning goals. In those days there were no interchangeable reserves, if you went off you stayed off, so Rogers couldn&#x27;t be quickly replaced.

Claremont failed to follow this meteoric rise, and between 1966 and 1978 participated in the finals only twice. In 1971 they were knocked out easily by an Alan Joyce-coached East Fremantle outfit, but in 1972 they lost only three home-and-away games and with players of the calibre of Graham Moss, Bruce Duperouzel, Colin Tully and Daryl Griffiths, were firm flag favourites, only to be beaten in both the second semi and grand finals by a more physical East Perth side. Despite recruiting Essendon Football Club full forward Geoff Blethyn, who came to Claremont in exchange for Graham Moss, the Tigers fell to last in 1973 with only four wins, and did even worse in 1975 with only three wins. The club were involved in an unusual incident in their Round 20 clash against West Perth Football Club during the 1976 season. Claremont coach Mal Brown replaced John Colreavy with Ross Ditchburn at three-quarter time, but when another player went off injured in the last quarter, Brown sent Colreavy back onto the ground, in contravention of the rule which specified that a player being replaced could not return to the field. Claremont lost the game 20.21 (141) to 13.18 (96), but had their score annulled after the game. When Moss returned in 1977 as captain-coach, he gradually moulded one of the most individually talented teams in WAFL history with such players as Jim and Phil Krakouer, Ken Hunter, Wayne Blackwell, John Annear, and Warren Ralph. In 1981 they kicked an Australian record 3,352 points in 21 matches, and won their fifth flag over an inaccurate South Fremantle. Despite lacking the &quot;enforcer&quot; needed to win many flags under pressure, between 1979 and 1994 Claremont played in the finals every year bar 1985 and 1992, and under Gerard Neesham&#x27;s extremely innovative coaching methods and &quot;chip and draw&quot; style, they won twenty and drew one of their last 21 games in 1987. Neesham&#x27;s skill was such that Claremont reached five successive grand finals for three flags despite the loss of most key players to the VFL (later AFL).

===2000–present===
After 1994, Claremont&#x27;s fortunes declined somewhat, and financial difficulties threatened their existence in the middle 1990s. However, at WAFL level they managed to remain competitive throughout the 1990s and 2000s if never threatening for a premiership until 2004, when they were thrashed by Subiaco in the grand final, a fate which befell Claremont again in 2005 from South Fremantle.

Claremont ended the 2007 season strongly, claiming the minor premiership, but lost to Subiaco in the WAFL Grand Final on 23 September 2007. Coach Ashley Prescott left the club at the end of the season to take up an assistant coaching role with Essendon. Prescott&#x27;s replacement was former assistant coach, Roger Kerr (former East Fremantle player and father of West Coast Eagles player, Daniel Kerr), who was given a two-year contract. Claremont also won the 2007 Rodriquez Shield (the team which has the best League, Reserves and Colts record combined).

Claremont&#x27;s 2008 campaign kicked off on 22 March against West Perth at Claremont Oval, which Claremont won by 14 points. It was Roger Kerr&#x27;s first game in charge of the club. He took the reins of the club, following the loss of experienced players such as Daniel Bandy (retired), Rowan Jones (retired), Luke Toia (retired), as well as Mitch Morton (Richmond) and Cale Morton (Melbourne). Other losses include Luke Dwyer (retired), Darren Harper (retired), Aaron Jarvis (retired), Trent Martin (East Perth), Tim Nelli (East Fremantle), Tom Matson (overseas) and Rory Walton (overseas). The Tigers&#x27; only gain this year was former Brisbane Lions midfielder Marcus Allan. The Tigers finished the season second last, saving themselves from the wooden spoon with a victory on the last day of the competition.

Claremont lost their first match of 2009 and things were starting to look a bit wobbly after they lost their second match. The losing streak continued, during which they lost nine games in a row. At the end of April the club decided to cut short Kerr&#x27;s two-year coaching contract. Claremont appointed Simon McPhee as a caretaker coach, becoming the club&#x27;s 30th league coach. McPhee had been the coach of Claremont&#x27;s Colts team for the last three seasons. Under the new coach the Tigers started to win a couple of games. They finished in eighth place on the ladder, with seven wins from twenty matches. The Claremont Colts side showed a great future for the league side, by defeating Peel Thunder in the Colts Grand Final, by over 8 goals. Another positive was that Chad Jones won the Bernie Naylor Medal, kicking 77 goals.

====Foxtel Cup (2011-12)====
Claremont reached the final of the 2011 Foxtel Cup, losing out 59 to 38 against VFL club Williamstown at Subiaco.

Once again in 2012 Claremont made the final, this time playing another VFL club Werribee, with the match again played at Subiaco. Claremont won the final with a score of 99 to 55, with Thomas Lee being awarded the Coles Medal for his best on ground performance.

Claremont capped off a fantastic season in 2010, claiming the minor premiership. They also reached the Grand Final against Swan Districts. The Reserves also claimed the minor premiership and set up a grand final clash with East Perth. Claremont dominated the home and away season finishing atop the table losing just twice and drawing once (a loss and a draw to the eventual Premiers Swan Districts and the final round defeat by East Perth). In the 2nd Semi Final Claremont crushed Swans at Claremont Oval by 50 points 17.17 (119) to 10.9 (69) with former Fremantle Dockers player Andrew Foster kicking 5 goals. Swan Districts then cruised to a win over East Perth in the Preliminary Final to set up a Grand Final for the ages between by far the 2 best sides in the competition in 2010. A classic contest it turned out to be too with the match swinging from one side to the other or the entire day, a pack mark by David Crawford deep into time-on was converted and seemed to give Claremont the flag for the first time in 14 years, but as the match wore on into the 32nd minute of the Final quarter Sandover Medallist Andrew Krakouer popped up to put Swans back in front. This time there was no reply from the Tigers and they went down in one of the finest ever WAFL Grand Finals 14.16 (100) to 14.15 (99). Key match-ups included Krakouer&#x27;s dominance and the move of Simon Starling to the forward line where he was virtually ineffective. The Reserves would win the Reserve grade Grand Final over East Perth 13.6 (84) to 10.12 (72). Midfielder Luke Blackwell would cap another stellar season by winning the EB Cook Medal as the Best &amp; Fairest player for the Tigers in 2010, he would also finish as Runner-up to Andrew Krakouer in the Sandover Medal count.

The club were once again the dominant side in the competition completing the season at the top of the league ladder winning 14 from 19 games and this time were successful in claiming the premiership. In the Grand Final Claremont defeated Subiaco by 56 points, 19.13 (127) to 10.11 (71), with Beau Wilkes of Claremont winning the Simpson Medal as best on ground. The 2011 Sandover Medal was won by Luke Blackwell. Club Captain, Clancy Rudeforth, announced his retirement from league football following the Grand Final victory.

Claremont were a foundation team in the WAFL Women&#x27;s competition starting in 2019.

==Current playing list==
==Club song==
Oh, We&#x27;re From Tigerland is the official club song of the Claremont Football Club and is sung to the tune of &quot;Row, Row, Row from Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. It was taken from the Richmond Football Club song, with an alteration to the second last line.

:Oh! We&#x27;re from Tigerland
:A fighting fury, we&#x27;re from Tigerland
:In any weather you will see us with a grin
:Risking head and shin
:If we&#x27;re behind then never mind
:We&#x27;ll fight and fight and win

:For we&#x27;re from Tigerland
:We never weaken &#x27;til the final siren&#x27;s gone
:Like the Tigers of old, we&#x27;re strong and we&#x27;re bold
:For we&#x27;re the Tigers, the old gold and blue
:We&#x27;re from Tigerland

<text>[[Deshamanya]] Arjuna Ranatunga (; ; born 1 December 1963), is a Sri Lankan politician and former cricketer, who was the 1996 Cricket World Cup winning captain for Sri Lanka, and scored the winning boundary in the final. He is regarded as the pioneer who lifted the Sri Lankan cricket team from underdog status to a leading force in the cricketing world.

After retirement, he worked in many posts of Sri Lanka Cricket administration. By entering his father&#x27;s stream of politics, Ranatunga started his political career in 2005, and is now the former cabinet Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.

Upon retirement from playing cricket he entered politics, joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and entered parliament, from Colombo District, in the 2001 elections. He served a tenure as deputy minister for tourism, and also served as the president of Sri Lanka Cricket until December 2008. He joined the Democratic National Alliance in 2010 and contested the 2010 elections. In January 2021, he revealed that he would distance himself from the United National Party and would not take part in party activities in the future.

He was also known for nurturing young cricket talents including the likes of Praveen Jayawickrama in their young days to take up the sport of cricket seriously. He was recently appointed the interim head of the Sri Lanka Cricket after the Sri Lankan government suspended the Sri Lanka Cricket Board after their loss to Indian Cricket Team in the ongoing Cricket World Cup.

==Personal life==
Arjuna Ranatunga is the son of Reggie Padmasena Ranatunga, the third Governor of Sabaragamuwa, serving between June 2005 and February 2008. His mother Nandani Ranatunga is a retired teacher. He has five siblings; cricketer Sanjeeva Ranatunga, along with Dammika Ranatunga, Nishantha Ranatunga, Prasanna Ranatunga, and Ruwan Ranatunga. He was born on 1 December 1963 in Gampaha near Colombo. He has a son Dhyan Ranatunga who is also a cricketer who currently lives in United States and in 2021, he was also signed to play for Minor League Cricket tournament in the USA.

==Cricket career==
===Alma Mater===
Ranatunga received his education at Ananda College, which has produced many known faces in Sri Lanka. Marvan Atapattu Sidath Wettimuny, Thilan Samaraweera, Dinesh Chandimal and Thilina Kandamby are among the players to pass out from Ananda College. He won the Observer Sri Lankan Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award on two occasions in 1980 and 1982 and became the first person to receive the award twice.

===Junior World Cricket===
Ranatunga played for Sri Lanka under-20 against India under-20 in 1980. In his very first game, he scored 128 not out. That Indian team featured the likes of Ravi Shastri, Lalchand Rajput, Sadanand Vishwanath, Chandrakant Pandit, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and Bharat Arun.

===Early international career===
Arjuna Ranatunga made his test debut on 17 February 1982 against England at the age of 18 in Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever test match at the P. Sara Oval. He scored 50 on test debut and also became the first Sri Lankan to score a half century in test cricket. He also shared a 99 run partnership with Ranjan Madugalle for the fourth wicket in Sri Lanka&#x27;s inaugural test match. He was also working as an insurance broker in his early days of his international career. He made his debut World Cup appearance for Sri Lanka during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He then featured in Sri Lanka&#x27;s historical test match against England at Lord&#x27;s in 1984 which also marked Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever test match at Lord&#x27;s.

He along with Asanka Gurusinha became the first pair of Sri Lankan batters to bat out the entire day of a test match for Sri Lanka with an unbroken partnership of 240 runs on a wicketless final day of the match against Pakistan at the P. Sara Oval in 1986 which also eventually led to a draw. Both came on to bat on a decisive fourth day of the test match when Sri Lanka was reeling at 83/3 and the duo endured resistance against the Pakistani bowling attack with the likes of Imran Khan, Abdul Qadir and Wasim Akram. Ranatunga ended up with a career best knock of unbeaten 135 while Gurusinha remained undefeated on 116 as Sri Lanka posted 323/3 at the end of the play on Day 5.

He was a key member of the Sri Lankan side which won its maiden Asia Cup title in 1986. He also top scored for Sri Lanka in the 1986 Asia Cup final against Pakistan scoring 57 runs off just 55 balls to propel Sri Lanka to a comfortable run chase of 192 with 7.4 overs to spare. He was also the leading run scorer of the tournament with an aggregate of 105 runs and was also adjudged as the player of the series in addition to his all-round display in the tournament taking 4 wickets.

===Captaincy===
Ranatunga went on to captain the Sri Lanka national cricket team in 1988, taking control of it for the next eleven years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit. He propelled Sri Lanka in a massive run chase of 313 against Zimbabwe at the 1992 World Cup by scoring unbeaten 88 which also marked the first instance that a team had successfully chased down the target in excess 300 in ODI history. Aravinda de Silva was the team captain at the 1992 World Cup.

He led the team to win the 1996 World Cup and he scored the winning runs for Sri Lanka in the final and remained unbeaten on 47. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket&#x27;s greatest prize. His strategies were commended by many cricketing greats and followed by their teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs as possible in the first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions. This strategy was still followed by the batsmen in the Powerplays. He was widely recognised as a belligerent leader and was famous for defending his players at all costs regardless of what they did.

He also captained Sri Lanka to triumph at the 1997 Asia Cup at home defeating India in the final to lift their second Asia Cup title and also it happened to be the first Asia Cup title for Sri Lanka since 1986 after a gap of 11 years. Ranatunga was also the top run scorer of the 1997 Asia Cup tournament with a tally of 272 runs with a remarkable average of 136 including a century and two fifties.

Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka secured their first ever historic test win in English soil against England and also the first ever test series win for Sri Lanka in England against England which happened to be in 1998 just two years after winning the 50 over World Cup. Sri Lanka secured a memorable 10 wicket win in that one-off test match and Ranatunga became the first Sri Lankan captain to register a test victory in England.

His younger brother Dammika Ranatunga made his test debut against Australia in 1989-90 when Arjuna was the captain of the Sri Lankan test side. It also became the first instance for Sri Lanka cricket whereas a cricketer had made his international debut for a team captained by his brother. Another one of is another brothers, Sanjeewa Ranatunga, also made his test debut when Arjuna was still the captain of Sri Lankan test side.

===1996 World Cup===
Arjuna Ranatunga is one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s greatest captains. He led the national team to victory in the 1996 World Cup. He represented Sri Lanka in 93 Tests and 269 One-Day Internationals (ODIs). While Ranatunga scored 241 runs during Sri Lanka&#x27;s 1996 World Cup winning campaign, he finished with the highest average in the tournament. There were other batsmen who scored more prolifically in the tournament, but Ranatunga&#x27;s average of 120.50 stood out. The next best was Aravinda de Silva with 89.60. For batsmen with over 100 runs in the tournament, Ranatunga had the second highest strike rate with 114.76. Only Sanath Jayasuriya was ahead with 131.54.

===Retirement===
Ranatunga lost the national team captaincy in 1999 after Sri Lanka&#x27;s poor showing at the World Cup in England, although he was chosen as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for that year.

In June 2000, Ranatunga played in Sri Lanka&#x27;s 100th Test match, becoming the only player to represent his country in their first and hundredth Test. He retired from playing cricket in 2001 and became a television commentator. In 2005, he joined the International Cricket Council&#x27;s cricket committee. He was then appointed as the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket in January 2008. However, he was sacked from the position in December 2008 for taking controversial decisions regarding selection of players.

In January 2015, he contested for the position of the Vice President of Sri Lanka Cricket during the Sri Lanka Cricket.

==Controversies==

===Fitness===
Ranatunga was known for controversially calling a runner during long innings due to his level of fitness and also he had reportedly twisted his ankle. After the second final of the One Day triangular series in Australia in the 1995/6 season, Ranatunga instructed his players not to shake the Australian players&#x27; hands. Australian wicketkeeper batsman Ian Healy who was initially not happy with Arjuna&#x27;s decision to take a runner abused him by saying &quot;You don&#x27;t get a runner for being an overweight fat cunt&quot;. However, Healy denied reports of racially abusing Arjuna during that match.

===Defence of Muralitharan===
Ranatunga is also remembered for his stand in a One Day International against England. Australian Umpire Ross Emerson called Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. (Muralitharan was subsequently cleared by bio-mechanical experts hired by the ICC.) Ranatunga exchanged heated words with umpire Emerson and led his team to a point just inside the boundary line, halting play and giving the impression that he was about to forfeit the match, until the Sri Lankan management conferred with him and play resumed. English captain, Alec Stewart, was openly critical of Ranatunga&#x27;s behaviour. In a comment caught on the stump microphone he was heard to say to Ranatunga &quot;Your conduct today has been appalling for a country&#x27;s captain&quot;. The match was bad-tempered, with instances of shoulder-bumping.

===Wrangles with Warne===
There has always been a grudging mutual admiration between Shane Warne and Ranatunga. When the former visited Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami to aid Muralitharan in his &quot;great work&quot; there, he developed an amiable rapport with his long-time foe: &quot;We even wagged,&quot; he confirmed later. Not long after, however, Ranatunga was lambasting him in a scathing newspaper attack. He also urged the ICC to ban Warne from participating at the 2003 Cricket World Cup after the latter had reportedly failed drugs test prior to the World Cup.

&quot;You can&#x27;t be mates with everyone,&quot; Warne wrote in his 2008 book &quot;Shane Warne&#x27;s Century&quot;, serialised by &quot;The Times&quot; in September, &quot;and if there was any way I could knock him down to number 101 for the purposes of this book, I&#x27;d be delighted to do so. But having taken on the task, I want to do it seriously, and the fact is that Ranatunga helped to put Sri Lanka on the cricket map. And you know what? Deep down, I&#x27;ll quietly admit that I rated him as a cricketer.&quot;

Following Warne&#x27;s death in 2022, Ranatunga wrote
&quot;...Shane and I had a very confrontational and competitive relationship on the field, but we also had immense mutual respect for each other.&quot;

===Remarks on IPL===
During the tenure as the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, he termed the Indian franchise T20 league Indian Premier League as &quot;instant noodles&quot; when it was introduced in 2008 and also blamed the IPL for causing severe financial losses to the cricket board due to the postponement of England&#x27;s scheduled tour to Sri Lanka. He also urged all Sri Lankan players to refrain from taking part in the 2013 IPL season due to the fact that Sri Lankan players were banned from featuring in IPL matches in Chennai by the Government of Tamil Nadu.

===2018 political crisis===
In October 2018, Arjuna who then served as the Petroleum minister was arrested by Sri Lanka Police following his alleged involvement in one of the turn of events as part of the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis.

===Match fixing allegations===
In July 2017, Ranatunga made a serious allegation that the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final match between India and Sri Lanka was fixed. He demanded a probe into the events at the final match. The erstwhile Sports Minister of Sri Lanka Mahindananda Aluthgamage also supported Ranatunga&#x27;s allegations. However, three years later, Sri Lankan Police suspended the match fixing probe citing lack of sufficient evidence. Later, International Cricket Council rubbished the match fixing claims made by Ranatunga and Aluthgamage. In 2018, former Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanga Sumathipala alleged both Arjuna and Aravinda de Silva to have involved in match fixing in 1994 and insisted that both of them had received money from Indian bookies. However, both Arjuna and Aravinda denied the allegations levelled by Sumathipala.

===Criticism of Sri Lanka cricket===
Arjuna Ranatunga has been a vocal critic of Sri Lanka Cricket administrators over the years especially after 2015 where Sri Lanka national cricket has suffered the worst decline at international cricket. He has blamed the cricket officials for not taking responsibility which has led to a significant downfall of Sri Lankan cricket and has repeatedly called for restructuring of the domestic structure in Sri Lanka which has been diluted with numerous clubs featuring in domestic first-class cricket competitions. He also slammed Sri Lanka Cricket for recruiting foreign coaches instead of grooming young talents and also termed the foreign coaches as &quot;garbage&quot;.

In June 2021, he also criticised sports minister Namal Rajapaksa for failing to solve the issues in the cricket administration despite the fact that Namal had invited Arjuna to rectify the current state of Sri Lanka cricket and the loopholes in the system. In a television interview as of June 2021, he made a controversial statement that Sri Lanka cricket officials arranged the bilateral limited overs series against second string Indian side with the intention of gaining revenue through television marketing and also further insisted that arranging international series against second string India team has undermined dignity of the legacy of Sri Lanka cricket and therefore would insult the Sri Lankan cricket. In addition, he also made another controversial statement that he would give three slaps to the current crop of national cricketers in wake of the disciplinary violations regarding the breach of bio-secure bubble by three of the Sri Lankan cricketers during the limited overs series tour of England.

===#MeToo allegations===
In 2018, an Indian flight attendant accused Arjuna of harassing her at a hotel in Mumbai.

==Political career==
He entered into politics by joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by Chandrika Kumaratunga, and contested the 2001 parliamentary elections with PA from Colombo District. After the UPFA victory in 2004, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Promotion. In 2006, he resigned from the post of junior minister tourism in order to concentrate on Sri Lanka Cricket administration.

In 2010, Ranatunga left the UPFA and joined the Democratic Party of the DNA led by Sarath Fonseka, and was made the deputy leader of the Democratic Party. In November 2012, he resigned from the Democratic Party, but continued his affiliation with DNA. He endorsed Maithripala Sirisena in the 2015 Presidential election, and after Sirisena&#x27;s victory Ranatunga was appointed Minister of Highways, Ports &amp; Shipping. In 2020, he was deemed as a possible candidate to replace Ranil Wickremasinghe as the leader of the United National Party who had resigned from the position in wake of the defeat at the parliamentary elections. In October 2020, he resigned from the post of Gampaha District Leader.

On 30 November 2021, he resigned from the United National Party expressing his dissatisfaction over the lack of clarity about the future of the party and regarding the failed leadership of the party.

<text>In Marxist and anarchist theories, the labor aristocracy is the segment of the &quot;working class which has better wages and working conditions compared to the broader proletariat, often enabled by their specialized skills, and in a global context by the exploitation of colonized or underdeveloped countries. Due to their better-off condition, such workers are more likely to align with the bourgeoisie to maintain capitalism instead of advocating for broader working-class solidarity and socialist revolution. 

The concept was introduced independently by revolutionary socialists Mikhail Bakunin (in the 1870s) and Friedrich Engels (in 1858), the latter describing the emergence of trade unions consisting of such workers in Great Britain in the late 19th century; Engels&#x27; theory was further developed by Vladimir Lenin, who tied the concept to imperialism. Revolutionary industrial unions, such as the Industrial Workers of the World, used the term to describe trade-based business unionism, which they considered exclusionary.

==Origins==

The theory that well-compensated and well-to-do proletarians are more manipulable into collaborating with the bourgeoisie was formulated by Friedrich Engels in a letter dated 7 October 1858 to Karl Marx.

A precursor to both wordings – &quot;aristocracy of labo[u]r&quot; and &quot;labo[u]r aristocracy&quot; – appears in Marx&#x27;s 1867 treatise &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Volume I.

Mikhail Bakunin, who also proposed in a fragment written in French around 1872 that relatively better-off proletarians were heavily bourgeois-influenced, is credited with coining the term &quot;aristocracy of labo[u]r&quot; (whence &quot;labo[u]r aristocracy&quot;), that term, however, is in fact found in Sam Dolgoff&#x27;s 1971 loose translation of Bakunin&#x27;s fragment, which contains no word translatable literally as &quot;aristocracy of labo(u)r&quot;.

The precise wordings &quot;aristocracy of labour&quot; and &quot;labour aristocracy&quot; are attested in works produced from the late 19th to early 20th century such as William Morris&#x27;s 1885 &quot;The Manifesto of The Socialist League&quot; (in English), Frank Kitz&#x27;s 1886 article &quot;Internationalism&quot; (in English), Paul Delasalle&#x27;s 1900 pamphlet &quot;L&#x27;action syndicale et les anarchistes&quot; (in French), Karl Kautsky&#x27;s 1892 book &quot;Das Erfurter Programm in seinem grundsätzlichen Theil erläutert&quot; (in German) and 1901 article &quot;Trades Unions and Socialism&quot; (translated into English by Eugene Dietzgen), etc.

== Use within Marxism ==

In Marxist theory, those workers (proletarians) in the developed countries who benefit from the superprofits extracted from the impoverished workers of developing countries form an &quot;aristocracy of labor&quot;. According to Lenin, companies in the developed world exploit workers in the developing world where wages are much lower. The increased profits enable these companies to pay higher wages to their employees &quot;at home&quot; (that is, in the developed world), thus creating a working class satisfied with their standard of living and not inclined to proletarian revolution. It is a form of exporting poverty, creating an &quot;exclave&quot; of lower social class. Lenin contended that imperialism had prevented increasing class polarization in the developed world.

The concept of a labor aristocracy is controversial between Marxists. While the theory is formally shared by most currents that identify positively with Lenin, including the Communist International, few organizations place the theory at the center of their work. The term is most widely used in the United States, where it was popularized in the decade prior to World War I by Eugene V. Debs&#x27;s Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World. In Britain, those who hold to this theory include the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist) and the Revolutionary Communist Group. Many Trotskyists, including Leon Trotsky himself and the early congresses of the Fourth International, have accepted the theory of the labor aristocracy whereas others, including Ernest Mandel and Tony Cliff, considered the theory to have mistaken arguments or &quot;Third Worldist&quot; implications.

Albanian leader and Marxist Enver Hoxha gave the following explanation for the development of the labor aristocracy following World War II: 

== Criticism of business unions of workers ==
In the United States and Britain, the term &quot;aristocracy of labor&quot; is used as an implicit criticism of labor unions that have organized high-salary workers and have no interest in unionizing middle-income and lower-income employees—even in cases where organizing the unorganized would strengthen the unions involved. These unions, it is argued, are content to remain a &quot;labor aristocracy&quot;. Examples might include the unions of professional athletes, which have raised the wages of a certain class of already highly paid workers—professional athletes—but refuse to organize other workers, including other employees of the teams they work for. It commonly charged that the Air Line Pilots Association, the Screen Actors Guild and a handful of other AFL–CIO unions conform to the labor aristocracy model of trade unionism.

At the beginning of the 20th century in the United States, &quot;most American Federation of Labor (AFL) unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers&quot;. Selig Perlman wrote in 1923 that skilled workers organized into craft unions were more interested in trade separatism than in labor solidarity. The craft workers were capable of demanding more from their employers due to their skills and preferred to fight separately from unskilled or semiskilled workers. In Perlman&#x27;s words, the trade unions declared that their purpose was &quot;to protect the skilled trades of America from being reduced to beggary&quot;.

In 1905, many existing unions actively lobbied for racist and anti-immigration policies through the creation of the notorious Asiatic Exclusion League. That same year, a new union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was formed in Chicago. The IWW, also known as the Wobblies, differed from the AFL in significant ways:
* The IWW organized without regard to sex, skills, race, creed, or national origin, from the very start.
* The AFL was craft based while the IWW inherited the tradition of industrial unionism pioneered by the Knights of Labor, the American Railway Union and the Western Federation of Miners (WFM).
* The IWW promoted the concept of all workers in one big union. Ever cognizant of the common practice of AFL craft unions crossing each other&#x27;s picket lines, the IWW adopted the WFM&#x27;s description of the AFL as the &quot;American Separation of Labor&quot;.
* The IWW believed that unions needed to build a labor movement with a structure that closely mapped the industries they sought to organize. A great merger movement had swept through corporations in the period from 1899 to 1903 and labor radicals believed that &quot;the unifaction of capital represented by the rise of the new trusts needed to be countered by an equally unified organization of the entire working class&quot;.

From its inception in 1905, the IWW criticized existing craft unions for creating a &quot;labor aristocracy&quot;. Eugene V. Debs wrote that &quot;seasoned old unionists&quot; could see that working people could not win with the labor movement they had. Debs believed the AFL practiced &quot;organized scabbery&quot; of one union on another, engaged in jurisdictional squabbling, was dominated by an autocratic leadership and the relationship between union leaders and millionaires in the National Civic Federation was much too cozy. IWW leaders believed that in the AFL there was too little solidarity and too little &quot;straight&quot; labor education. These circumstances led to too little appreciation of what could be won, and too little will to win it.

Animated by a class philosophy that saw capitalism as an economic system dividing society into two classes—those who own, manage, or rule; and those who have only their labor to sell—the IWW declared:[...] the working class and the employing class have nothing in common. [...] Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers [...] take and hold that which they produce by their labor through an economic organization of the working class.

In contrast, the AFL declared: We have no ultimate ends. We are going only from day to day. We are fighting only for immediate objects—objects that can be realized in a few years [...] we say in our constitution that we are opposed to theorists [...] we are all practical men.

Labor historian Melvyn Dubofsky has written the following: By 1896 Gompers and the AFL were moving to make their peace with Capitalism and the American system. Although the AFL had once preached the inevitability of class conflict and the need to abolish &#x27;wage slavery&#x27;, it slowly and almost imperceptibly began to proclaim the virtues of class harmony and the possibilities of a more benevolent Capitalism.

The AFL therefore preached &quot;pure and simple&quot; trade unionism. The AFL concerned itself with a &quot;philosophy of pure wage consciousness&quot;, according to Selig Perlman, who developed the &quot;business unionism&quot; theory of labor. Perlman saw craft organizing as a means of resisting the encroachment of waves of immigrants. Organization that was based upon craft skills granted control over access to the job.

While craft unions provided a good defense for the privileges of membership, conventions such as time-limited contracts and pledges not to strike in solidarity with other workers severely limited the ability of craft unions to effect change in society at large, leaving only the ineffectual means granted by a business-dominated elite society, i.e. electoral politics, lobbying congress and a newly enfeebled economic weapon, the injunction-circumscribed strike. However, the AFL embraced this &quot;businesslike&quot; and &quot;pragmatic&quot; worldview, adopting the motto &quot;A fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work&quot;.

The AFL outlived the class consciousness of its own founding Preamble, but the IWW embraced the goal of abolishing wage slavery. In 1908, the IWW responded to what it considered the AFL&#x27;s class collaborationist tendencies with new wording in the IWW Preamble: Instead of the conservative motto, &quot;A fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work,&quot; we must inscribe upon our banner the revolutionary watchword, &quot;Abolition of the wage system.&quot; [...] The army of production must be organized, not only for the every-day struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown.

The IWW saw itself as the answer to the conservatism of the AFL. The IWW developed a variety of creative tactics in its effort to &quot;build a new world within the shell of the old&quot;. Because the AFL declined to act as an ally in such a cause, the Wobblies sought to develop solidarity with all rank and file workers while criticizing or spoofing AFL union leadership. AFL union &quot;bosses&quot; were (and still are) referred to by the Wobblies as &quot;piecards&quot;. To the IWW, all the union bureaucracy of the AFL functioned pretty much as a &quot;labor aristocracy&quot;. In that regard, the IWW&#x27;s views have not changed much over the years.

Mainstream unions have evolved, embracing some of the principles of industrial unionism and (in many cases) opening their doors to a greater spectrum of the working class. However, there are many aspects to business unionism that solidarity unionists still find suspect– a tendency to operate as a business, rather than according to &quot;union principles&quot;; enthroning elite hierarchies of leadership which are not easily recalled by the membership; deriving significant income from the sale of insurance or credit cards, arguably leading to conflicts of interest; union leadership compensation levels that are closer to those of corporate executives than of rank and file workers; top-down decision making; and building relationships with the leadership of corporations or political parties that the rank and file may view with suspicion.

All union movements function in some fashion to raise up workers in social or economic status or in union privilege. The significant difference between a union movement with a labor aristocracy and a union movement based upon class solidarity is how and to what extent the structure, bureaucracy and in particular policies and practices of that union movement function, either to leave that level of increased privilege as the &quot;status quo&quot;, or to recognize the necessity of building structural relationships, promoting education and engaging in solidarity activities with the specific intention of translating gains into an effort to enhance the status of all working people.

== In Maoist Third Worldism ==
In his 1983 book &quot;&quot;, J. Sakai argues that the class system in the United States is built upon the genocide of Native Americans and the enslavement of Africans and that the white working class in the United States constitutes a privileged labor aristocracy that lacks proletarian consciousness. Arguing that the white working class possesses a petit-bourgeois and reformist consciousness, the book posits that only the colonized peoples of the United States constitutes the proletariat.

<text>The Eden Valley Railway (EVR) was a railway in Cumbria, England. It ran between Clifton Junction near Penrith and Kirkby Stephen via Appleby-in-Westmorland.

Passenger traffic ended in 1962 and the line was reduced to the track between the junction at Appleby station with the Settle-Carlisle Line and Kirkby Stephen which served a quarry. By 1976 all that was left was of track between Appleby in Westmorland and Flitholme. It was used by infrequent British Army services to Warcop Training Area until 1989.

In 1995 the Eden Valley Railway Society was formed with the aim of reinstating services and restoring on the line. Heritage railway services resumed in 2006 between Warcop and Sandford, with an extension of being opened in 2013, giving a current running line of almost .

==History==

===Background===
Before the construction of the Eden Valley Railway, in the 1840s, several schemes had been proposed which would have run to the Eden Valley; one was the &quot;York &amp; Carlisle Junction Railway&quot;, backed by the Great North of England Railway, which would have run from Northallerton to Barnard Castle then across the Pennines to Kirkby Stephen, after which two branches would have been formed to connect with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway; one to Tebay and the other to Clifton. Another similar scheme was the &quot;Northumberland &amp; Lancashire Union&quot; which would have run from Gateshead near Newcastle upon Tyne to Barnard Castle, and then as the York &amp; Carlisle line across the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to Tebay. Additionally the &quot;Yorkshire and Glasgow Union Railway&quot; was planned to run west from Thirsk through Wensleydale to Hawes, then north through the Mallerstang Valley to Kirkby Stephen, and then through the Eden Valley to Clifton via Appleby-in-Westmorland. Both the Yorkshire &amp; Glasgow Union and part of the York &amp; Carlisle Junction to Tebay were empowered by acts of Parliament in 1845 but the end of the Railway bubble of the 1840s meant that they were not built.

It was not until the late 1850s that a line through the Eden Valley was proposed again. Firstly a new trans-Pennine railway line was proposed, reviving the earlier schemes; the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway (SD&amp;LUR) was to run from the Stockton and Darlington Railway to Kirkby Stephen and then to Tebay. A second line, the Eden Valley Railway would branch from the first at Kirkby Stephen and then go to Clifton via the upper Eden Valley. The main purpose of these lines was freight, not passengers; bringing higher grade iron ore from Cumberland and Lancashire to the blast furnaces of the North East, and coal and coke from the mines of Durham to the northwest of England. The route was shorter than the alternative, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway.

The act of Parliament authorising South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway was passed on 13 July 1857, and that for the Eden Valley Railway came soon after on 21 May 1858.

The act allowed the raising a capital of £180,000, the appointed directors of the company include important figures from Westmorland and Cumberland including William Brougham, Sir Richard Tufton Isaac Wilson as well as Henry Pease.

===Construction and route===
Construction of the line was contracted to Messrs. Lawton Brothers of Newcastle, the turning of the sod ceremony took place on 4 August 1858 with Lord Brougham. Most of the stone for the railway&#x27;s stations was quarried near Cliburn. Construction of the line was straightforward with only three minor rivers to cross and no tunnels in low-lying land; the maximum incline was 1 in 80, the average 1 in 150. The cost of construction had been £204,803 0s 8d ().

From Kirkby Stephen East station on the SD&amp;LUR the line to Cumbria curves northwest to the junction at which the Eden Valley railway separates from the Tebay line and begins to travel roughly north. after the junction a bridge over Scandal Beck is reached which was crossed by an iron bridge, less than further north the River Eden was crossed by Musgrave viaduct of three lattice girder iron spans.

Next was the minor Musgrave station to the west of the village of Great Musgrave. The line then curved to the northwest towards Warcop and after reached Warcop station. From Warcop the line continued northwest along the Eden valley north of the Eden crossing Coupland Beck after by a viaduct, and then continued to Appleby about after Warcop station.

 running northwest from Appleby the railway reached Kirkby Thore station, then just over west-northwest to Temple Sowerby station south of the village of the same name. The river Eden was crossed once more at Skygarth viaduct which had four lattice girders each of , whence the line ran roughly west to Cliburn railway station north of the village of Cliburn. The line then continued west, and curved south on a chord connecting it to a north facing junction near Clifton, Cumbria connecting the line to Clifton and Lowther station on the Lancaster &amp; Carlisle Railway.

The line was built as a single track line and was worked by the Stockton and Darlington Railway from its inception, it opened for mineral trains on 8 April 1862, and for passengers on 9 June the same year.

===1862 to 1923: NER===

Soon after opening the amalgamation of the railway into the Stockton and Darlington Railway along with the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway and Frosterley and Stanhope Railway was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament on 30 June 1862. The following year the Stockton and Darlington merged into the North Eastern Railway, and the Eden Valley line too became part of that larger system.

During the construction of the railway, in 1861, an act of Parliament was passed that would increase the importance of the Eden Valley Line. This was the act permitting the construction of the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway, which by 1865 had been opened. It connected to the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, and hence the ports and industrialised iron-rich regions of the west Cumbrian coast (Workington, Whitehaven) were linked to the Lancaster and Carlisle line (operated by the London and North Western Railway) near Penrith close to the Eden Valley&#x27;s own junction. This made the Eden Valley line a route of choice for transport of materials between the north east and north west of England. Permission to build a connection allowing trains from the north to run directly onto the Eden Valley line was obtained in 1862, and the new section opened in 1863, along with a new station for Clifton (renamed Clifton Moor in 1927) on the chord. Eden Valley passenger trains now ran via this northern track, and had running powers on the L&amp;CR line, now going to Penrith. After 1874 the southern chord was abandoned.

During the 1870s the Settle and Carlisle Railway was being constructed, which also ran through the upper Eden Valley. West of the station in Appleby in Westmorland a junction with the Eden Valley railway was built allowing trains travelling north to cross onto the westbound Eden Valley line. Further west the Settle line crossed over the Eden Valley line.

===1923 to 1948: LNER===

In 1923, the Eden Valley Railway was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in accordance with the Railways Act 1921. On September 1, 1927, then Clifton station was given its current name, Clifton Moor station. This was to differentiate itself from Clifton and Lowther station, a part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.

In 1936, the route going through Redhills to Penrith was removed, thereby limiting all future freight to transporting local goods.

===1948 to 1989: British Railways===

In 1948 the railways of Britain were nationalised and the line became part of British Railways. In the following decade several stations closed: Musgrave station in 1952, Kirkby Thore in 1953, Temple Sowerby closed to passengers in 1953, and Cliburn station in 1956.

In 1958 a two car diesel multiple unit service was introduced. However between 1962 and 1963 the entire line closed to passengers. At the same time the Stainmore railway also closed completely apart from a short section of track eastwards from Kirkby Stephen East railway station to Merrygill Viaduct for the quarry nearby. From then on only freight trains used the line.

The line from Clifton to Appleby was also closed, and, from 1963 points east of Appleby could only be reached via the junction with the Settle and Carlisle railway at Appleby. Freight trains still ran from Appleby to Kirkby Stephen and then to Hartley Quarry (). In 1974 that service ended and the track was removed except for about between Appleby and Warcop. Trains for the Warcop Training Area north of Warcop village ran until 1989.

===The line today===
The section of line between Appleby and Warcop has been restored by the Eden Valley Railway Trust, originally known as the Eden Valley Railway Society. At the southern end of the route, the Stainmore Railway Company has reinstated a short stretch of track near Kirkby Stephen East station.

Other than in the restored sections, none of the track remains in situ. Most of the trackbed remains as a feature on the landscape and as field boundaries. To the south east of Kirkby Thore the A66 road crosses the trackbed close to where Kirkby Thore station once stood, and the station was demolished when the road was remodelled in 1974. Clifton Moor, Cliburn, Temple Sowerby and Warcop and Musgrave railway stations are now private residences. Other features including the signal boxes at Cliburn and Warcop have survived. The bridges at Musgrave and Skygarth have been removed. The former junction west of Kirkby Stephen with the line to Tebay is now a nature reserve.

<text>Telecomsoft was a British video game publisher and a division of British Telecom. The company was founded by Ederyn Williams in 1984 and operated three separate labels: Firebird, Rainbird, and Silverbird. The first employee was James Leavey, seconded from elsewhere in BT, who, along with Tony Rainbird, became the driving force behind the company in the early days.

==History==
Telecomsoft was founded in 1984 when computer games were the fastest growing sector within the computer software market at the time.
Despite a turnover of over £6 million in 1987/88, British Telecom sold the three labels to MicroProse in 1989 in a deal reported to be worth around £2,000,000 after a failed management buyout. MicroProse sold the Silverbird label soon after acquisition, but continued to use the Rainbird and Firebird labels for a short period.

==Labels==

=== Firebird ===
British Telecom brought in Tony Rainbird, owner of budget software publisher Micro-Gold, to help set up the first Telecomsoft label, Firebird.
Originally named Firefly Software, the label had to be renamed when it was discovered that the name had already been registered by another company.

The first titles to be published on the Firebird Silver label in November 1984 were &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, &quot;Booty&quot; for the Commodore 64 and &quot;Bird Strike&quot; for the BBC Micro. 

Although there were doubts as to whether or not the market could afford to sustain a range of budget titles, the Firebird Silver releases were successful. In February 1985, &quot;Booty&quot; was the third best selling video game in the UK, behind only &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot;. 

While Firebird Silver would release budget titles priced at £2.50, Firebird Gold would release more prestigious titles at a higher price. Firebird Gold established itself just as well as its budget counterpart. The label became synonymous with many classic 8-bit titles such as &quot;Elite&quot;, &quot;Revs&quot;, and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. 

In October 1985, the budget range was relaunched as the lower priced Firebird Silver 199 Range and a full price label, Firebird Hot, was created to publish titles such as &quot;Costa Capers&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Technician Ted&quot;. A further label called Firebird Super Silver was a short-lived mid-price range which published titles such as &quot;Chimera&quot; and the Amstrad CPC version of &quot;Booty&quot; at £3.99.

Firebird&#x27;s success allowed them to acquire a number of third party developers, see &quot;Telecomsoft acquisitions&quot; below, and they also established a deal with Ultimate Play the Game, whereby they would convert and publish a number of their successful ZX Spectrum games to the Commodore 64.

As the Rainbird label became the home of Telecomsoft&#x27;s premium products, the Gold and Hot labels slowly merged into a single full price range which went on to publish Mike Singleton&#x27;s Dark Sceptre and the home conversions of &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.

A final overhaul of the Firebird brand was conducted in early 1988 as the budget titles became rebranded as Silverbird.

=== Silverbird ===

Rather than attempt to juggle a potentially confusing budget label with the same branding as their full price software, Telecomsoft decided to rebrand their Silver 199 budget label as a single &quot;Silverbird&quot; range. Two price points were established for 8-bit software (£1.99 and £2.99) while a few budget 16-bit titles were priced at £9.99. These various price points were differentiated between by their own particular style of packaging.

Rather than simply republish their existing range of budget software, &quot;Silverbird&quot; published a range of titles that hadn&#x27;t previously been released at a budget price point. This included many original new titles as well older full-price titles acquired from other publishers.

Following MicroProse&#x27;s acquisition of Telecomsoft, the US publisher sold off the &quot;Silverbird&quot; label to a Tudor Enterprises, a British publisher. They published a compilation pack of old &quot;Silverbird&quot; titles and a small number of original titles before closing down their software publishing operations.

=== Rainbird ===

The Rainbird label was established in November 1985 by Tony Rainbird. For legal reasons, the label&#x27;s original name, Bluebird, had to be changed, although it still retained Tony Rainbird&#x27;s original idea of releasing all its games in striking blue packaging.

The 16-bit home computer market, largely represented by the Atari ST and Amiga, was just beginning to take off in 1986 and the Rainbird label was an ideal opportunity to capitalise on it. Rather than concentrate on the more simplistic arcade action games that had dominated the 8-bit era, Rainbird aimed to introduce cutting edge simulators, adventure games and utilities to the full-price market.

Rainbird formed partnerships with a number of developers who would produce their next range of games. Magnetic Scrolls and Argonaut Software were amongst the first developers to benefit from a publishing deal with the label. Realtime Games, a successful ZX Spectrum developer who specialised in fast 3D action games, converted &quot;Starglider&quot; to the ZX Spectrum and developed &quot;Carrier Command&quot;.

The company republished enhanced versions of adventure games by Level 9 Computing, beginning with their &quot;Middle-earth&quot; trilogy: &quot;Colossal Adventure&quot; (itself an enhanced conversion of &quot;Adventure&quot; by Will Crowther and Don Woods), &quot;Adventure Quest&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Adventure&quot;, these last two featuring the Demon Lord Agaliarept. Rainbird published this sequence as &quot;Jewels of Darkness&quot; and references to Middle-earth were expunged. Rainbird also published Level 9&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Dreams&quot; trilogy: &quot;Snowball&quot; was followed by &quot;Return to Eden&quot; and &quot;The Worm in Paradise&quot;.

MicroProse continued to use the Rainbird label for a number of years, after its acquisition of Telecomsoft.

===Acquisitions===

====Beyond Software====
One of Telecomsoft&#x27;s earliest acquisitions was Beyond Software. Originally set up by the EMAP publishing group in 1983, Beyond published numerous titles on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, but met with very little success until the release of Mike Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Lords of Midnight&quot; in 1984. The Tolkien-esque strategy game, and allowed Beyond to establish a distribution deal with American developers First Star, as well as a publishing deal with developer Denton Designs.

After being acquired by Telecomsoft in late 1985 for a six figure sum, Beyond continued to operate as a unique label, mostly releasing games that had already been in development for some time, as well as a number of conversions of existing titles. Telecomsoft did very little with the Beyond label beyond these releases. A number of other titles, such as &quot;Star Trek: The Rebel Universe&quot;, were released on the Firebird label.

<doc id="1160716" wikidata="Q376311" url="?curid=1160716" title="Panaca, Nevada">
<text>Panaca is an unincorporated town in eastern Lincoln County, Nevada, United States, on State Route 319, about east of U.S. Route 93, near the border with Utah. Its elevation is above sea level. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 963. It is one of only two cities in Nevada that prohibits gambling, the other being Boulder City.

==History==
The area that was to become the Panaca settlement was explored by Mormons in 1857. Brigham Young dispatched the explorers in order to locate a potential refuge in case of a U.S. military campaign against Utah. The location was selected due to the Meadow Valley oasis at the headwaters of the Muddy River. Mormon scouts began irrigation ditches and started fields, but the site was soon deserted after the feared violence never materialized. Panaca was the first permanent settlement by European Americans in southern Nevada. It was founded as a Mormon colony in 1864. It began as part of Washington County, Utah, but the congressional redrawing of boundaries in 1866 shifted Panaca into Nevada. It is the only community in Nevada to be &quot;dry&quot; (forbidding the sale of alcoholic beverages), and the only community in Nevada, besides Boulder City, that prohibits gambling.

Coke ovens here once produced charcoal for the smelters in nearby Bullionville (now a ghost town), but the town&#x27;s economy is predominantly agricultural.

The name &quot;Panaca&quot; comes from the Southern Paiute word &quot;Pan-nuk-ker&quot;, which means &quot;metal, money, wealth&quot;. William Hamblin, a Mormon missionary to the Paiutes, established the Panacker Ledge (Panaca Claim) silver mine there in 1864.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Panaca census-designated place has an area of , all of it land. Along Nevada State Route 319 it is east to the Utah state line and from there another east to Cedar City, Utah. West from Panaca it is to U.S. Route 93, at which point it is north to Pioche and south to Caliente.

==Transportation==
The Panaca area is served by the following highways:

* U.S. Route 93 (Great Basin Highway)
* Nevada State Route 319 (Main Street)
* Nevada State Route 816 (Panaca Airport Road)

The Lincoln County Airport is a public-use airport operated by Lincoln County. It is located to the west of Panaca&#x27;s central business district and is accessed via State Route 816.

==Demographics==
==Attractions==
Panaca is located near Cathedral Gorge State Park.

The following Nevada historical markers have been placed in Panaca:

* Panaca (#39)
* Panaca Mercantile Store (#93)
* Panaca Spring (#160)
* Panaca Ward Chapel (#182)

Panaca celebrates Pioneer Day on the Saturday closest to July 24. Events include cannon firing at 6 A.M., games and races, a parade, art displays, and a community dinner. This coincides with the Utah holiday commemorating the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley.
