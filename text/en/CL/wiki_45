<text>The Red Guards () were a mass, student-led, paramilitary social movement mobilized by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1966 until their abolition in 1968, during the first phase of the Cultural Revolution, which he had instituted. 

According to a Red Guard leader, the movement&#x27;s aims were as follows:
Despite meeting with resistance early on, the Red Guards received personal support from Mao, and the movement rapidly grew. The movement in Beijing culminated during the &quot;Red August&quot; of 1966, which later spread to other areas in mainland China. Mao made use of the group as propaganda and to accomplish goals such as seizing power and destroying symbols of China&#x27;s pre-communist past (&quot;Four Olds&quot;), including ancient artifacts and gravesites of notable Chinese figures. Moreover, the government was very permissive of the Red Guards, and even allowed the Red Guards to inflict bodily harm on people viewed as dissidents. The movement quickly grew out of control, frequently coming into conflict with authority and threatening public security until the government made efforts to rein the youths in, with even Mao himself finding the leftist students to have become too radical. The Red Guard groups also suffered from in-fighting as factions developed among them. By the end of 1968, the group as a formal movement had dissolved with many of the red guards sent to rural areas and country side due to the Down to the Countryside Movement.

==Origins==

The first students to call themselves &quot;Red Guards&quot; in China were from the Tsinghua University High School, who were given the name to sign two big-character posters issued on 25 May – 2 June 1966. The students believed that the criticism of the play &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot; was a political issue and needed greater attention. The group of students – led by Zhang Chengzhi at Tsinghua Middle School and Nie Yuanzi at Peking University – originally wrote the posters as a constructive criticism of Tsinghua University and Peking University&#x27;s administrations, who were accused of harbouring intellectual elitism and bourgeois tendencies. Most of the early Red Guards came from the so-called &quot;Five Red Categories&quot;. 

The Red Guards were denounced as counter-revolutionaries and radicals by the school administration and by fellow students and were forced to secretly meet amongst the ruins of the Old Summer Palace. Nevertheless, Chairman Mao Zedong ordered that the manifesto of the Red Guards be broadcast on national radio and published in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; newspaper. This action gave the Red Guards political legitimacy, and student groups quickly began to appear across China. By the end of August 1966, almost every Chinese city and a majority of counties had Red Guard activity. Eighty-five percent of counties had local Red Guard activity by October 1966. According to sociologist Andrew G. Walder, &quot;These figures represent a remarkable level of popular political mobilization. At no point in the previous history of the regime were ordinary citizens permitted, much less encouraged, to form independent political organizations.&quot;

Due to the factionalism already emerging in the Red Guard movement, President Liu Shaoqi made the decision in early June 1966 to send in Chinese Communist Party (CCP) work teams. These workgroups were led by Zhang Chunqiao, head of China&#x27;s Propaganda Department, in an attempt by the Party to keep the movement under control. Rival Red Guard groups led by the sons and daughters of cadres were formed by these work teams to deflect attacks from those in positions of power towards bourgeois elements in society, mainly intellectuals. In addition, these Party-backed rebel groups also attacked students with &#x27;bad&#x27; class backgrounds, including children of former landlords and capitalists. These actions were all attempts by the CCP to preserve the existing state government and apparatus.

Mao, concerned that these work teams were hindering the course of the Cultural Revolution, dispatched Chen Boda, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, and others to join the Red Guards and combat the work teams. In July 1966, Mao ordered the removal of the remaining work teams (against the wishes of Liu Shaoqi) and condemned their &#x27;Fifty Days of White Terror&#x27;, a label referencing the period of time the work teams were active. The Red Guards were then free to organize without the restrictions of the Party and, within a few weeks, on the encouragement of Mao&#x27;s supporters, Red Guard groups had appeared in almost every school in China.

Mao had multiple reasons for supporting the Red Guards&#x27; activities, with the primary one being his wish to undermine Liu Shaoqi, with whom he grew increasingly distrustful. Furthermore, Mao intended to make the revolutionary ideals more ingrained in the Chinese youth, as a way to harden their spirit and combat traditional scholarly education.

Chiang Kai-Shek believed Mao lost trust in CCP officials and members, Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) members, and even workers, peasants and soldiers, so he had put faith in the students, and made use of the Red Guards to preserve his authority, Chiang also believed Mao started the massive purge among knowledgeable and contributive CCP officials and members and CYLC members in the name of Maoism, let Red Guards replace them to inherit the party.

== Role in the Cultural Revolution ==

=== Red August ===
Mao Zedong expressed personal approval and support for the Red Guards in a letter to the Tsinghua University Red Guards on 1 August 1966. During the &quot;Red August&quot; of Beijing, Mao gave the movement a public boost at a massive rally on 18 August at Tiananmen Square. Mao appeared atop Tiananmen wearing an olive green military uniform, the type favored by Red Guards, but which he had not worn in many years. He personally greeted 1,500 Red Guards and waved to 800,000 Red Guards and onlookers below. 

The rally was led by Chen Boda and Lin Biao gave a keynote speech. Red Guard leaders, led by Nie Yuanzi, also gave speeches. A high school Red Guard leader, Song Binbin, placed a red armband inscribed with the characters for &quot;Red Guard&quot; on the chairman, who stood for six hours. The 8-18 Rally, as it was known, was the first of eight receptions the Chairman gave to Red Guards in Tiananmen in the fall of 1966. It was this rally that signified the beginning of the Red Guards&#x27; involvement in implementing the aims of the Cultural Revolution.

A second rally, held on 31 August, was led by Kang Sheng and Marshal Lin Biao also donned a red arm band. The last rally was held on 26 November 1966. In all, the Chairman greeted eleven to twelve million Red Guards, most of whom traveled from afar to attend the rallies including one held on National Day 1966, which included the usual civil-military parade.

During Red August, large number of members of &quot;Five Black Categories&quot; were persecuted and even killed. Mao had originally instructed the PLA to not interfere against the Red Guards&#x27; violence, by vaguely ordering the army to &#x27;support the left&#x27;.

=== Attacks upon the &quot;Four Olds&quot; ===

In August 1966, the 11th Plenum of the CCP Central Committee had ratified the &#x27;Sixteen Articles&#x27;, a document that stated the aims of the Cultural Revolution and the role students would be asked to play in the movement. After the 18 August rally, the Cultural Revolution Group directed the Red Guards to attack the &#x27;Four Olds&#x27; of Chinese society (i.e., old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas). For the rest of the year, Red Guards marched across China in a campaign to eradicate the &#x27;Four Olds&#x27;. Old books and art were destroyed, museums were ransacked, and streets were renamed with new revolutionary names, adorned with pictures and the sayings of Mao. Many famous temples, shrines, and other heritage sites in Beijing were attacked.

The Cemetery of Confucius was attacked in November 1966 by a team of Red Guards from Beijing Normal University, led by Tan Houlan. The corpse of the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery.

Attacks on other cultural and historic sites occurred between 1966 and 1967. One of the greater damages was to the Ming Dynasty Tomb of the Wanli Emperor in which his and the empress&#x27; corpses, along with a variety of artifacts from the tomb, were destroyed by student members of the Red Guard. During the assault on Confucius&#x27; tombs alone, more than 6,618 historic Chinese artifacts were destroyed in the desire to achieve the goals of the Cultural Revolution.

Individual property was also targeted by Red Guard members if it was considered to represent one of the Four Olds. Commonly, religious texts and figures would be confiscated and burned. In other instances, items of historic importance would be left in place, but defaced, with examples such as Qin Dynasty scrolls having their writings partially removed, and stone and wood carvings having the faces and words carved out of them.

Re-education came alongside the destruction of previous culture and history; throughout the Cultural Revolution schools were a target of Red Guard groups to teach both the new ideas of the Cultural Revolution as well as to point out what ideas represented the previous era idealizing the Four Olds. For example, one student, Mo Bo, described a variety of the Red Guards activities taken to teach the next generation what was no longer the norms. This was done according to Bo with wall posters lining the walls of schools pointing out workers who undertook &quot;bourgeois&quot; lifestyles. These actions inspired other students across China to join the Red Guard as well. One of these very people, Rae Yang, described how these actions inspired students. Through authority figures, such as teachers, using their positions as a form of absolute command rather than as educators, gave students a reason to believe Red Guard messages. In Yang&#x27;s case it is exemplified through a teacher using a poorly phrased statement as an excuse to shame a student to legitimize the teacher&#x27;s own position.

==== Murder and oppression ====

Attacks on culture quickly descended into attacks on people. Ignoring guidelines in the &#x27;Sixteen Articles&#x27; which stipulated that persuasion rather than force were to be used to bring about the Cultural Revolution, officials in positions of authority and perceived &#x27;bourgeois elements&#x27; were denounced and suffered physical and psychological attacks. On 22 August 1966, a central directive was issued to stop police intervention in Red Guard activities. Those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled &quot;counter-revolutionaries.&quot; Mao&#x27;s praise for rebellion effectively endorsed the actions of the Red Guards, which grew increasingly violent.

Public security in China deteriorated rapidly as a result of central officials lifting restraints on violent behavior. Xie Fuzhi, the national police chief, said it was &quot;no big deal&quot; if Red Guards were beating &quot;bad people&quot; to death. The police relayed Xie&#x27;s remarks to the Red Guards and they acted accordingly. In the course of about two weeks, the violence left some 100 teachers, school officials, and educated cadres dead in Beijing&#x27;s western district alone. The number injured was &quot;too large to be calculated.&quot;

The most gruesome aspects of the campaign included numerous incidents of torture, murder, and public humiliation. Many people who were targets of &#x27;struggle&#x27; could no longer bear the stress and committed suicide. In August and September 1966, there were 1,772 people murdered in Beijing alone. In Shanghai there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders during the same period.

Intellectuals were to suffer the brunt of these attacks. Many were ousted from official posts such as university teaching, and allocated manual tasks such as &quot;sweeping courtyards, building walls and cleaning toilets from 7am to 5pm&quot; which would encourage them to dwell on past &quot;mistakes.&quot; An official report in October 1966 stated that the Red Guards had already arrested 22,000 &#x27;counterrevolutionaries&#x27;.

The Red Guards were also tasked with rooting out &#x27;capitalist roaders&#x27; (those with supposed &#x27;right-wing&#x27; views) in positions of authority. This search was to extend to the very highest echelons of the CCP, with many top party officials, such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Dehuai, being attacked both verbally and physically by the Red Guards. Liu Shaoqi was especially targeted, as he had taken Mao&#x27;s seat as State Chairman (Chinese President) following the Great Leap Forward. Although Mao stepped down from his post as a sign of accepting responsibility, he was angered that Liu could take the reins of communist China.

=== Clashes with the PLA ===
The Red Guards were not completely unchallenged. They were not permitted to enter Zhongnanhai, the Forbidden City, or any military facility that was tasked with classified information (i.e. special intelligence, Nuclear Weapons development). Several times, Red Guards attempted to storm Zhongnanhai and the 8341 Special Regiment, which was responsible for Mao&#x27;s security, fired upon them.

Jiang Qing promoted the idea that the Red Guards should &quot;crush the PLA,&quot; with Marshal Lin Biao seemingly supportive of her plans (e.g., permitting Red Guards to loot barracks). At the same time, several military commanders, oblivious to the ongoing chaos that the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) had to deal with, disregarded their chain of command and attacked Red Guards whenever their bases or people were threatened. When Red Guards entered factories and other areas of production, they encountered resistance in the form of worker and peasant groups who were keen to maintain the status quo. In addition, there were bitter divisions within the Red Guard movement itself, especially along social and political lines. The most radical students often found themselves in conflict with more conservative Red Guards.

The leadership in Beijing also simultaneously tried to restrain and encourage the Red Guards, adding confusion to an already chaotic situation. On the one hand, the Cultural Revolution Group reiterated calls for non-violence. On the other hand, the PLA was told to assist the Red Guards with transport and lodging, and assist in organizing their rallies within the capital. By the end of 1966, most of the Cultural Revolution Group were of the opinion that the Red Guards had become a political liability. The campaign against &#x27;capitalist roaders&#x27; had led to anarchy, the Red Guards&#x27; actions had led to conservatism amongst China&#x27;s workers, and the lack of discipline and the factionalism in the movement had made the Red Guards politically dangerous. 1967 would see the decision to dispel the student movement.

=== Red Guard press ===
During the early period of the Cultural Revolution, independent publications by mass political organizations such as Red Guards grew, reaching an estimated number as high as 10,000. Publications were not uniform in style or form and ranged from mimeographed tabloids to newspapers printed with professional metal type in broadsheet format. The first Red Guard newspapers, &quot;Red Guard News&quot; (红卫兵报; &quot;Hongweibing bao&quot;) and &quot;Red Guard&quot; (红卫兵; &quot;Hongweibing&quot;) were published on September 1, 1966. 

Red Guard newspapers adopted standard journalistic practices such as publishing editorials and commentator articles, as well as reprinted articles from publications such as &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;. Red Guard newspapers contained many articles regarding big-character posters and their function within the information environment of the Cultural Revolution.

A small but significant group of the Red Guard press focused on press criticism. This subset of Red Guard newspapers criticized pre-Cultural Revolution practices and proposed new modes of journalism. For example, a group of journalists from the prestigious newspaper &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; founded a rebel newspaper called &quot;Guangming&quot; &quot;Battle Bulletin&quot; (光明战报; Guangming zhanbao) in which they denounced the press theories of Liu Shaoqi and argued that the proletarian press should be a tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Rebel workers at Xinhua News Agency also published newspapers in which they commented and reported on press issues.

Because of their grass roots nature and organic connection with the masses, the Red Guard press was able to exercise public oversight over the Party press.

&quot;Enveloped in a trance of excitement and change,&quot; all student Red Guards pledged their loyalty to Chairman Mao Zedong. Many worshipped Mao above everything and this was typical of a &quot;pure and innocent generation,&quot; especially of a generation that was brought up under a Marxist party, which discouraged religion altogether.
Mao quickly formed an army based on individual interpretations of Mao&#x27;s statements. All groups pledged loyalty to Mao and claimed to have his best interests in mind, yet they continually engaged in verbal and physical skirmishes throughout the Cultural Revolution, proving that there was no core political foundation at work. These skirmishes were often violent, with rivaling groups obtaining both assault rifles and explosives, as well as utilizing forced imprisonments and widespread torture. This domestic anarchy continued until the second half of the Cultural Revolution, when the 9th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party started civil policies.

Youths from families with party-members and of revolutionary origin joined conservative factions. These factions focused on the socio-political status quo, keeping within their localities and working to challenge existing distributions of power and privilege. Those from the countryside and without ties to the CCP often joined radical groups who sought to change and uproot local government leadership. Among the disputes between Red Guard factions was the bloodline theory advocated by most conservative Red Guard groups in the early period of the Cultural Revolution. Under this political view, the issue of a good class background was a precondition for political participation. Students whose parents had been labeled right wing elements in 1957, for example, were not admitted in groups adhering to the bloodline theory. Although it was quickly politically discredited, the bloodline theory was highly influential and contentious among Red Guards in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution.

The primary goal of the radicals was to restructure existing political and social systems, as supposed &quot;capitalist roaders&quot; were corrupting the Socialist agenda. Primarily influenced by travel and a freer exchange of ideas from different regions of China, more joined the radical, rebel factions of the Red Guards by the second half of the Cultural Revolution.

Some historians, such as Andrew Walder, argue that individuals and their political choices also influenced the development of Red Guard factions across China. Interests of individuals, interactions with authority figures, and social interactions all altered identities to forge factions that would fight for new grievances against &quot;the system&quot;.

==Suppression by the PLA (1967–1968)==
By February 1967, political opinion at the center had decided on the removal of the Red Guards from the Cultural Revolution scene in the interest of stability. The PLA forcibly suppressed the more radical Red Guard groups in Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Fujian, and Hubei provinces in February and March. Students were ordered to return to schools; student radicalism was branded &#x27;counterrevolutionary&#x27; and banned. These groups, as well as many of their supporters, were later branded May Sixteenth elements after an ultra-left Red Guard organization based in Beijing.

May Sixteenth elements (五一六分子) were named after the so-called May Sixteenth Army Corps (五一六兵团; 1967–1968), ultra-left Red Guards in Beijing during the early years of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) who targeted Zhou Enlai with the backing of Jiang Qing. The name came from the historic May 16 Notice (五一六通知) which Mao Zedong partially wrote and edited, which triggered the revolution. However, Mao was concerned with its radicalism, so in late 1967 the group was outlawed on conspiracy and anarchism charges, followed by the arrest of most Cultural Revolution Group members (except Jiang Qing). Mao became increasingly frustrated with the Red Guards&#x27; perceived inability to cooperate, which was the ongoing cause of constant violence. This eventually led to chairman&#x27;s decision to call on the PLA to reestablish order. A nationwide campaign was later launched to liquidate &quot;May Sixteenth Elements&quot;, which created further chaos.

There was a wide backlash in the spring against the suppression, with student attacks on any symbol of authority and PLA units, but not on Marshal Lin Biao, the Minister of National Defense and one of the Chairman&#x27;s biggest allies. An order from Mao, the Cultural Revolution Group, the State Council, and the Central Military Affairs Committee of the PLA on 5 September 1967 instructed the PLA to restore order to China and end the chaos. The order came within months of incidents of PLA forces disobeying government and CRG orders during the summer (the most extreme case being the Wuhan incident, where the Wuhan Military Region under Chen Zaidao went further than cracking down on Red Guards to arrest the Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi), the aftermath of these resulted in even more violence amongst the Red Guards, even targeting local level PLA formations, raising fears of a repeat of the Wuhan events and other similar ones.

The PLA violently put down the national Red Guard movement in the year that followed, with the suppression often brutal. A radical alliance of Red Guard groups in Hunan province, called the Shengwulian, was involved in clashes with local PLA units, for example, and in the first half of 1968 was forcibly suppressed. At the same time the PLA carried out mass executions of Red Guards in Guangxi province that were unprecedented in the Cultural Revolution.

The final remnants of the movement were defeated in Beijing in the summer of 1968. Allegedly, Mao had an audience with the Red Guard leaders, during which the Chairman informed them of himself being directly responsible for the orders to suppress them, in favor of the military&#x27;s administration. After the summer of 1968 some more-radical students continued to travel across China and play an unofficial part in the Cultural Revolution, but by then the movement&#x27;s official and substantial role was over.

== Rustication==

From 1962 to 1979, 16 to 18 million youths were sent to the countryside to undergo re-education.

Sending city students to the countryside was also used to defuse the student fanaticism set in motion by the Red Guards. On 22 December 1968, Chairman Mao directed the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; to publish a piece entitled &quot;We too have two hands, let us not laze about in the city&quot;, which quoted Mao as saying &quot;The intellectual youth must go to the country, and be educated from living in rural poverty.&quot; In 1969 many youths were rusticated.

== Economic positions ==
Among the economic positions some Red Guards supported was the abolishment of interest. 

The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the People&#x27;s Bank of China were Red Guards and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch. The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.

== Monuments ==
Due to the sensitive nature of this part of Chinese history, most Red Guard cemeteries were demolished prior to 2007. The Red Guard Cemetery in People&#x27;s Park (人民公园) in Shapingba District, Chongqing commemorates a group of the Red Guard called the 815. In December 2009 that cemetery was made the first Cultural Revolution relic to be formally recognized for its cultural heritage site.

<text>During its independent political history, Brazil has had seven constitutions. The most recent was ratified on October 5, 1988.

== Imperial Constitution (1824) ==

=== Background ===
Prior to its independence on September 7, 1822, Brazil had no formal Constitution, since Portugal only adopted its first Constitution on September 23, 1822, 16 days after Brazil proclaimed independence.
In 1823, Emperor Pedro I started the political process of writing a Constitution.

Drafting of the first Constitution of Brazil was quite difficult and the power struggle involved resulted in a long-lasting unrest that plagued the country for nearly two decades. Two major facts increased the troubles:
* Large numbers of recent immigrants from Portugal (the so-called &quot;Portuguese Party&quot;), who wanted to keep their privileges or who were still loyal to the metropolitan government. These were found both among the wealthier parts of the population, as businessmen controlling Brazil&#x27;s international trade, and the lower ones, as tradesmen and free urban workers (the Brazilian elite was mostly rural).
* The majority of the population was composed of slaves, prompting the whites to fear being massacred in the event of a rebellion caused by a failing state.

The first circumstance meant that despite strong support of the Crown Prince Pedro I by the Brazilian landowners (the so-called &quot;Brazilian Party&quot;), the opinions of the &quot;reinóis&quot; (name then given to recent immigrants from Portugal) should be considered. As each side had very distinct and different objectives none could prevail and a compromise was needed.

There were also additional problems: the Constitutional Assembly had been elected to decide the applicability of Portuguese laws in Brazil, not to draft a new constitution. As a result, some of the Portuguese deputies refused to take part in it. On the other hand, the liberal Brazilian deputies had been persecuted: some were exiled while others were imprisoned. Thus the Constitutional Assembly did not hear an appreciable number of opinions and would reflect the objectives of the &quot;Brazilian Party&quot;, to the detriment of the &quot;Portuguese Party&quot; and the liberals.

As the draft constitution progressed it became clear that the deputies were trying to establish a constitution that would:
* curtail the powers of the monarch,
* restrict most political rights to landowners and deny them to the Portuguese, and
* establish an authoritarian, but constitutional, monarchy, whose head of government would be the Emperor himself, aided by a group of ministers of his choice.
The emperor did not want to serve as a mere decorative figurehead, but rather to protect the interests of the Portuguese businessmen (who were the main economic base of Brazil) and prevent any further cession of his power to the Parliament. 

In light of the wave of conservatism led by the Holy Alliance, the Emperor used his influence over the Brazilian Army to dissolve the Constitutional Assembly, in what became known as the Night of Agony. On his own authority, he then issued a constitution that concentrated the executive power on the Emperor himself (eventually crowned &quot;Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil&quot;).

Based on the French Constitution of 1791 and the Spanish Constitution of 1812, the Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority. It created executive, legislative, judicial, and moderating branches as &quot;delegations of the nation&quot; with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.

The Constitution of 1824 was rather less parliamentary than the draft prepared by the Constituent Assembly. In fact, it was for all purposes a peculiar and unique regime: a &quot;presidential&quot; monarchy. That did not mean, by any means, that the Brazilian monarch had prerogatives resembling those of a tyrant or dictator. The individual guarantees of human liberty and dignity were inserted into the articles of the Charter and were respected. The Emperor would not act in areas reserved to the legislative branch and the judiciary, such as to create laws or to judge and sentence. 

Even though it vested the emperor with more power than its would-be predecessor, the Imperial constitution was considered very progressive for its time. It was considered more progressive than several constitutions used by European liberal powers.

=== The Constitution ===

The new constitution, published on March 25, 1824 outlined the existence of four powers:
* Executive — The State Council
* Legislative — The General Assembly, formed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies
* Judiciary — The Courts
* Moderator — Vested in the Emperor, was supposed to resolve any incompatibilities between the other three, acting as a &quot;neutral&quot; power, in accordance to the theories of the French-Swiss thinker Benjamin Constant.

The Emperor controlled the Executive by nominating the members of the State Council, influenced the Legislative by being allowed to propose motions and having the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies (senators sat for life, however, being individually chosen by the emperor among the top three candidates in a given province) and also influenced the Judiciary, by appointing (for life) the members of the Highest Court.

This constitution established the Brazilian Empire as a Unitary state (the provinces had little autonomy, if any). The Amendment (&quot;Ato Adicional&quot;) of August 12, 1834, enacted in a period of liberal reform, authorized the provinces to create their own legislative chambers, which were empowered to legislate on financial matters, create taxes and their own corps of civil servants under a chief executive nominated by the central power; it was however revised by an &quot;interpretive&quot; act of May 1840, enacted in a period of conservative reaction, which allowed the central power to appoint judges and police officers in the provinces.

On July 20, 1847, a Decree (number 523) established the post of Prime Minister, formally titled &quot;president of the Council of Ministers&quot; (not to be confused with the State Council, whose ten members sat for life and which in the late Empire functioned solely as an advising body to the Emperor). Appointed by the emperor, the Prime Minister then chose a cabinet of state secretaries, or ministers. The cabinet had to maintain the support of a majority in the General Assembly. The emperor&#x27;s acts were not valid without the countersignature of the minister responsible for the issue concerned. The 1847 decree thus turned the Brazilian Empire into a standard constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.

The franchise was very limited, being censitary and indirect: no male citizen who was not head of a household and/or had a net yearly income of less than a hundred milréis was allowed to vote in the primary elections that chose actual electors, empowered with the right to vote for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. As a result, Brazilian legislatures had a decided conservative slant. Combined with widespread electoral frauds, no Prime Minister chosen by the Emperor – who had the power to order the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and new elections to it – ever failed to win a parliamentary majority in subsequent elections.

The Constitution of 1824, enacted in the name of the Holy Trinity, also instituted Catholicism as the state religion, allowing other religions to be practiced only in private: non-Catholic places of worship could not be fashioned to appear as religious buildings from the outside. It also excluded slaves from Brazilian citizenship, by extending it to all people born in Brazil who were freeborn or freed.

== Old Republic Constitution (1891) ==
=== Background ===
On November 15, 1889, the emperor Pedro II was deposed, Brazilian monarchy abolished and the 1824 Constitution was put out of effect. No provisional constitution was used while a definitive successor document was being written. The writing process began in 1889, by a group of jurists and politicians, and the text was later amended by a Constitutional Congress on February 24, 1891.

=== The Constitution ===

In its final form, the new Constitution meant to create a federal state to promote individual liberties above all, following the basic principles of the Constitution of the United States, albeit with the adoption of a slightly different (and somewhat more centralized) form of federalism.

The main traits of the constitution were:
* Federalism: the provinces were turned into states whose indissoluble union was taken as forming the Body Politic of the Brazilian Federation. Governors (at the time called State Presidents) were to be elected by direct vote and a fixed term of office.
* Separation of the State and Church.
* Male universal suffrage (with exceptions, mostly illiterates, beggars and members of monastic orders) and basic individual rights for all citizens. Abolition of the death penalty.
* Adoption of standard three-way separation of powers under a presidential republic on the American model; direct elections for all members of the Legislative and chief officers of the Executive branch. The Executive branch was headed by a President of the Republic, elected by direct voting (rather than an Electoral college in the American model) – who had a four-year term and could not be reelected for a second, successive, term – and his freely chosen cabinet of ministers. The Senate was reorganized as the Upper House of the Legislative branch, formed of representatives of the states (as opposed to the representatives of the people in the Chamber of Deputies) directly elected and with fixed terms of office.

== Third Constitution (1934) ==
=== Background ===

In 1930, after severe political problems, President Washington Luís was overthrown by a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. The 1891 Constitution was annulled and the Provisional President Getúlio Vargas ruled as a &quot;de facto&quot; personal dictator, but the state landed elites (who had controlled the Brazilian state ever since independence) struggled to prevent this from continuing. In 1932, in São Paulo, the Constitutionalist Revolution demanded a Constitution. As a result, a Constitutional Assembly was elected and the constitution was promulgated on July 16, 1934, less than four years after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; had overthrown the Old Republic. Vargas accepted this constitution in order to legitimise his power.

=== The Constitution ===
This constitution was the shortest-lived Constitution of Brazil, lasting only three years (until 1937).

Despite its short life, this constitution was important because it was the first time a Brazilian constitution was written from scratch by directly elected deputies in multi-party elections. As a consequence of this, it incorporated a number of improvements to Brazilian political, social and economical life:
* Granted complete independence to the Supreme Court and subordinated all other courts to it.
* Extended political rights to all adults, regardless of sex.
* Introduced proportional voting for elections to the Chamber of Deputies, which included representatives of the people as well as a minority of representatives from trade unions and other professional organizations – a corporatist device introduced under the shock of the Russian Revolution and the influence of Italian fascism.
* Created a specific electoral court to supervise elections, under the control of the Supreme Court (previously the supervision of elections was under control of the Legislative Branch).
* Following a trend set by the German Weimar Constitution, acknowledged a whole host of social rights alongside political and civil ones: the national minimum wage, the eight-hour workday, mandatory weekly rest, paid vacations and indemnity for unmotivated firing.
* Created a labor court to supervise working conditions and codified rights and duties for both the employers and the employees.
* Was the first Brazilian constitution to list all four basic freedoms (speech, religion, movement and assembly) alongside the basic rights (life, freedom and property).

== &quot;Estado Novo&quot; Constitution (1937) ==
=== Background ===
On the night of November 10, 1937, Vargas announced in a nationwide radio address that he was seizing emergency powers under the pretext of suppressing a Communist-backed coup (the so-called Cohen Plan). On the same night, he promulgated a new constitution that effectively transformed his presidency into a legal dictatorship (the short interval suggesting that the self-coup had been planned well in advance). It was written by the minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, and proofread by Vargas and his minister of War (joint-commander of the Army and Air Force), Eurico Gaspar Dutra.

=== The Constitution ===

The new document was called the &quot;Polaca&quot;, or Polish, Constitution because it was inspired by the Polish April Constitution of 1935. It was intended to consolidate the powers of the president, while substantially limiting the powers and autonomy of Congress and the judiciary. While clearly dictatorial, it was not intended to be completely totalitarian and repressive. It kept most social improvements of the previous constitution, and added more: The right to education, the right to culture preservation and guidelines for family rights, building on the Civil Code of 1917.

On the other side, however, it heavily concentrated executive power:
* Political parties were dissolved.
* State &quot;presidents&quot; (elected) would be replaced by interventionists (appointed by the president of the republic).
* Mayors would in turn be appointed by the interventionists.
* Capital punishment was to be enforced on &quot;traitors to the state&quot; (a fairly broad category).
* All requirements for an outright dictatorship (censorship, purges, militarism, state propaganda, cult of personality and others) were either required, allowed or not forbidden by the constitution.

== Fifth Constitution (1946) ==

=== Background ===
When Vargas was forced to resign in 1945, a new constitution was written, once again by a directly elected Constitutional Congress.

=== The Constitution ===
This was the first Brazilian constitution to provide full political freedom (even the Brazilian Communist Party was made legal, though briefly) and the last to officially name the country &quot;Estados Unidos do Brazil&quot; (and the spelling of the country&#x27;s name would change later that year). It was also the first with an additional &quot;Act of Transitory Measures&quot; (a set of laws that came into effect &quot;before&quot; the constitution itself and could not be changed).
The key points of this constitution were:
* Restore all rights and freedoms as expressed by the 1934 Constitution which had been suppressed in 1937.
* Reducing the powers of the presidency. While it remained the key institution, numerous institutional safeguards were put in place to prevent a repeat of Vargas&#x27; authoritarian excesses.
* Establish full equality before the law.
* Created mechanisms to prevent and oppose religious prejudice and censorship (the latter with some exceptions regarding &quot;moral censorship&quot; of spectacles and public shows).
* Mentioned the right to postal privacy and the inviolability of homes (until then police could enter anyone&#x27;s house without a permit).
* Improved federalism by extending the powers of the member states (for instance, it was the first time states were allowed to have flags and anthems).
* Although it was not the first time all adults were granted full political rights, it was under this constitution that the first free and fair elections were held at all levels and for all offices.
* Elections for executive offices would be held in a single round.
* Voters could freely choose candidates of any party, including for vice president and vice governor.

The last two would become the major problems of this constitution, as they were prone to produce and fuel both legitimacy crises (as the presidents were usually elected by less than a majority of votes) and conspiracies (as the vice-president was usually from another party).

== Sixth Constitution (1967) ==

=== Background ===

After the military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of April 1, 1964 the controllers of the new regime kept the 1946 constitution and promised to restore democracy as soon as possible. However, they did not and were faced with a dilemma, as every major measure they took was strictly against that current constitution, including the coup itself.

The so-called Institutional Acts sequentially issued by the military presidents were, in practice, placed higher than the Constitution and could amend it. Even under these circumstances, the first military president, Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, was committed to restoring civilian rule in 1966. However, a large number of military and civilian extremists felt the military had to stay in power for some years. They also wanted to pass more &quot;proper&quot; laws to fight &quot;subversive individuals&quot; (anyone that opposed the regime).

By 1965, however, the situation reached an unbearable point when opposition candidates won the governorship of Minas Gerais and Guanabara. Castelo Branco refused to annul the results. A coup was only averted when Castelo Branco agreed to support the military&#x27;s reform program. By this time, the military had decided to drop all pretense of democracy. It also felt the 1946 constitution was &quot;obsolete&quot; as the &quot;new institutions&quot; were not foreseen in it.

A new constitution was written by a team of lawyers commissioned by Castelo Branco and amended (under the instructions of Castelo Branco himself) by the Minister of Justice, Carlos Medeiros Silva and voted on as a whole by the Brazilian Parliament (already purged of most opponents of the status quo).

=== The Original Constitution ===
The main features of the new Constitution were:
* Restriction of political rights: direct elections would only be held at state and county level, but not in federal territories or cities considered of interest to national security for any reason (such cities were specified as those near the international border, state capitals, important industrial centers, university towns, jungle towns, towns close to power plants, mining sites, etc). About 500 cities/towns were listed--in practice, the largest and most important ones. Presidents and governors were chosen in indirect elections by the correspondent Legislative branch (the National Congress and State Legislatures). However, these &quot;elections&quot; were elaborate shams. In practice, the president was selected by the military command, while governors were hand-picked by the president and his advisers. The federal and state legislatures were dominated by government supporters, meaning the government candidate could not possibly be defeated.
* Restriction of civil rights: any meeting, assembly, or gathering of people should be formal, must be previously authorized, and conducted under supervision. Unauthorized meetings would be disbanded by the police and participants sued if lucky; they were more likely imprisoned, tortured, or worse.
* Military (uniformed) State Police Corps acknowledged as reserve corps of the Federal Army (as well as State Fire Brigades), with the task of outdoor patrolling to &quot;provide public security&quot;, thereby reducing the autonomy of the existing civilian (plainclothes) police to an investigative role.
* Removal of all privileges of judges, allowing the president to force them to retire or to remove them (the latter was never used).
* After previously disbanding of all political parties (which had existed for only twenty years), new rules were written on the formation of parties. These rules were so restrictive that only two parties were formed—the government party, the National Renewal Alliance Party (Arena), and the controlled opposition of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB).
* Limitation of states&#x27; autonomy.
* Establishment of a series of controls, commissions, and institutions to regulate and report a number of aspects of civil, social, and economic life, thus intensifying an already existing trend towards bureaucracy, top-heavy management of the economy by the central government.
* Granting the president the right to issue decrees (&quot;Decretos-Lei&quot;) that would enter in force at the moment of their publication and be inscribed in the statute-book after 30 days in the absence of Congressional deliberation on them.

=== Amendments of 1969 ===
In 1969, this already severely authoritarian document was widely amended by a provisional military junta and made even more repressive. The 1969 Amendment is sometimes regarded as a seventh Constitution, because it almost completely rewrote the text of the 1967 document.
The new constitutional text brought some extra tools for the regime:
* Giving the president the right to declare a state of emergency and suspend constitutional freedoms.
* Broadened capital punishment.
* Banishment – with loss of citizenship – as punishment.
* Suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.
* Special military courts to try members of the military accused of crimes.
* Transfer of command of the military police from each federal state to the Ministry of the Army.
* Restrictions on travel.

From 1979 onward, however, the constitution was gradually purged of its authoritarian character. This process accelerated with the return of civilian rule in 1985, culminating in the adoption of a new constitution in 1988.

== Citizen Constitution (1988–present) ==
=== Background ===
The seventh and current Brazilian Constitution was promulgated on October 5, 1988 after a two-year process in which it was written from scratch by a Constitutional Congress elected in 1986.

=== The Constitution ===
It appears as a reaction to the period of military dictatorship, seeking to guarantee all manner of rights and restricting the state&#x27;s ability to limit freedom, to punish offenses and to regulate individual life. On the other hand, it did not provide clear rules for state reform and kept the economic regulation of the country intact.

Among the new constitutional guarantees are the errand of injunction and the &quot;habeas data&quot; (one&#x27;s right to have access to any data about him kept by the Government). It also anticipated the existence of a Consumers&#x27; Defence Code (which was brought out in 1990), of Children&#x27;s and Youth Code (1990) and of a new Civil Code (2002).

It was the first constitution to demand severe punishment for breaches of civil liberties and rights. Consequently, Brazil later approved a law making the propagation of prejudice against any minority or ethnic group an unbailable crime. This law provided legal redress against those who spread hate speech (like Neo-Nazis) or those who do not treat all citizens equally. This second aspect helped disabled people to have a reserved percentage of jobs in the public service (and soon in all large companies), and black people to seek reparation for prejudice in the courts.

Breaking with the authoritarian logic of the Constitution of 1967, it made unbailable crimes those of torture and of actions directed against the democratic state and the constitutional order, thus creating constitutional devices to block &quot;coups d&#x27;état&quot; of any kind.
Willing to create a truly democratic state, the Constitution has established many forms of direct popular participation besides regular voting, such as plebiscite, referendum and the possibility of ordinary citizens proposing new laws. Examples of these democratic mechanisms were the 1993 plebiscite concerning the form of government, where the Presidential system was confirmed, and the 2005 referendum concerning the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition.

The mention of God in the preamble of the Constitution (and later on the Brazilian currency) was opposed by most leftists as incompatible with freedom of religion because it does not recognize the rights of polytheists (like the Amerindians) or atheists, but it has not been removed so far. The only State Constitution that does not refer to God is the one of Acre. The Supreme Federal Court has ruled that this omission of the protection of God was not unconstitutional since the preamble of the constitution is simply an indication of principles that serves as an introduction to the constitutional text and reflects the ideological conceptions of the legislator, falling within the scope of political ideology and not of the law. Therefore, the preamble which is not actually a part of the supreme law, has no judicial validity whatsoever and cannot impose obligations or create rights.

=== Amendments ===
Despite its advances concerning individual rights and freedoms and also in government control, the Constitutional text brought dispositions that resulted in severe difficulties concerning governmental efficiency. In the following years, especially from 1995 onwards, this meant it had to be amended many times to get rid of impractical, contradictory or unclear provisions (but also to accommodate the economic reforms conducted by the government, for which such amendments have been sometimes criticized ). As of August 2020, this Constitution has been amended 108 times.

<text>Cypress-Medicine Hat is a provincial electoral district in the southeast corner of Alberta.

Under the Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution of 2004, the constituency covers the portion of Medicine Hat south of the South Saskatchewan River, the Trans-Canada Highway and Carry Drive. The rest of the city is part of the Medicine Hat constituency, which Cypress-Medicine Hat surrounds. The constituency borders Saskatchewan to the east and Montana to the south. Clockwise from the Montana border, the district also borders Cardston-Taber-Warner, Little Bow, Strathmore-Brooks and Drumheller-Stettler. Other major towns include Bow Island and Redcliff. The constituency represents Cypress County and the County of Forty Mile No. 8.

The MLA for this district is the United Conservative Party&#x27;s Justin Wright. Prior to 2023 the district was represented by Drew Barnes, who was first elected in 2012 as a Wildrose Party candidate in the 28th Alberta general election.

==History==
The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old electoral district of Cypress-Redcliff.

The 2010 boundary redistribution saw only minor changes made in the middle of the riding to align with changes to the Medicine Hat city limits.

===Boundary history===


===Representation history===
The electoral district was created in the boundary redistribution of 1993 from the old Cypress-Redcliff riding. The biggest change was the inclusion of parts of Medicine Hat that resulted in the name change.

The first election in the district held in 1993 was won by Progressive Conservative candidate Lorne Taylor who won with a comfortable margin defeating three other candidates. He won his second term with a stronger majority in 1997. Premier Ralph Klein promoted him to the cabinet and held a few portfolio&#x27;s after that election. He won a third term in 2001 before retiring in 2004.

The second member for the district was Leonard Mitzel who was elected to his first term in the 2004 election. He was re-elected in 2008 with a landslide.

In the 2012 Alberta general election Wildrose candidate Drew Barnes defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Leonard Mitzel. Barnes captured 53.6 per cent of the vote. Barnes was subsequently reelected in 2015 capturing 54.5 per cent of the vote. In 2017 the Barnes became a member of the United Conservative Party when the Wildrose Party merged with the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. Barnes was subsequently reelected in 2019, capturing 67.1 per cent of the popular vote. On May 13, 2021, Barnes and Central Peace-Notley MLA Todd Loewen were expelled from the United Conservative caucus to sit as an independents.

On November 19, 2004 a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<text>Brenner tumours are an uncommon subtype of the surface epithelial-stromal tumour group of ovarian neoplasms. The majority are benign, but some can be malignant.

They are most frequently found incidentally on pelvic examination or at laparotomy. Brenner tumours very rarely can occur in other locations, including the testes.

==Presentation==
On gross pathological examination, they are solid, sharply circumscribed and pale yellow-tan in colour. 90% are unilateral (arising in one ovary, the other is unaffected). The tumours can vary in size from less than to . Borderline and malignant Brenner tumours are possible but each are rare.

==Diagnosis==
Histologically, there are nests of transitional epithelial (urothelial) cells with longitudinal nuclear grooves (coffee bean nuclei) lying in abundant fibrous stroma.

The coffee bean nuclei are the nuclear grooves exceptionally pathognomonic to the sex cord stromal tumour, the ovarian granulosa cell tumour, with the fluid-filled spaces Call–Exner bodies between the granulosa cells.

==Similar conditions==
Transitional cell carcinoma is an even rarer entity, in which neoplastic transitional epithelial cells similar to transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are seen in the ovary, without the characteristic stromal/epithelial pattern of a Brenner tumour.

Histologically, Leydig cell tumours of the testes and ovarian stromal Leydig cell tumours (ovarian hyperandrogenism and virilization) both have characteristic Reinke crystals. The same crystals were also noted under high-power view in Brenner tumours.

==Eponym==
It is named for Fritz Brenner (1877–1969), a German surgeon who characterized it in 1907. The term &quot;Brenner tumour&quot; was first used by Robert Meyer, in 1932.

<doc id="1169206" wikidata="Q5130609" url="?curid=1169206" title="Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma">
<text>Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma, or clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary, also called ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma, is one of several subtypes of ovarian carcinoma – a subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, in contrast to non-epithelial cancers. According to research, most ovarian cancers start at the epithelial layer which is the lining of the ovary. Within this epithelial group ovarian clear-cell carcinoma makes up 5–10%. 

It was recognized as a separate category of ovarian cancer by the World Health Organization in 1973. Its incidence rate differs across various ethnic groups. Reports from the United States show that the highest rates are among Asians with 11.1% versus whites with 4.8% and blacks at 3.1%. These numbers are consistent with the finding that although clear-cell carcinomas are rare in Western countries they are much more common in parts of Asia.

==Background==
There are two subtypes of ovarian carcinoma – epithelial and nonepithelial; ovarian clear-cell carcinoma is an epithelial ovarian cancer. The other major subtypes within this group include high-grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and low-grade serous. The serous type is the most common form of epithelial ovarian tumors. Cord-stromal and germ cell belong to the nonepithelial category which are much less common. 

==Structure and function==
Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma often occurs as a pelvic mass that rarely appears bilaterally. The cells usually contain glycogen with large clear cytoplasm. It is also associated with endometriosis, a disorder of abnormal tissue growth outside of the uterus. The tumor cells emerge in a stepwise manner from adenofibromas which are benign endometriotic cysts. They also hold molecular genetic mutations in both ARID1A and PIK3CA, similar to other epithelial ovarian cancers. Mutations in ARID1A commonly contain phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) that are hypothesized to contribute to clear-cell tumorigenesis. However, research also shows that inactivation of ARID1A alone does not lead to tumor initiation. However, clear-cell tumors rarely carry p53, BRCA1, or BRCA2 mutations. In addition, they also test negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and Wilm tumor suppressor 1. Studies have also suggested that clear-cell carcinoma can occur with thromboembolic complications and hypercalcemia. Recurrence of tumor cells have been reported to involve lymph nodes and parenchymal organs. 

Research continues to look for ways to understand clear-cell tumor progression. A suggested mechanism is the amplification and overexpression of CCNE1 which is thought to promote the tumor&#x27;s aggressive behavior. In addition, they also test negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and Wilm tumor suppressor 1. The CCNE1 gene encodes for the cyclin E1 protein which accumulates at the G1-S phase transition point of the cell cycle. Detecting the cancerous tumor progression can be difficult for pathologists. While some tumors will appear in the ovary, others spread over the outer lining of the ovary and to other organs such as the uterus, fallopian tube, and lymph glands.

==Clinical relevance==
Clear-cell tumors are frequently found at an early stage and therefore can be cured with surgery. Through clinical examination or preoperative imaging techniques, tumors have been reported to range from 3-20 cm. Most ovarian tumors are benign and rarely spread past the ovary. Therefore, surgical removal of the ovary or partial removal of the ovary is sufficient for treatment for malignant tumors. When diagnosed beyond FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage 1 patients usually have a poor prognosis. If the malignant tumors metastasize and spread throughout the body then they could potentially be fatal. Clear-cell tumors have been found to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy using platinum and taxane. Although the cause of this chemoresistance is unknown, there is research that provides partial explanation of this occurrence. For example, studies show that clear-cell tumor cells proliferate at lower rates than serous adenocarcinomas which then could aid in a lower response from clear-cell tumors to chemotherapies. 

Given that treatment options are limited for ovarian clear-cell cancer patients, researchers are studying biomarkers or specific pathways that could aid in developing future treatment. These patients are good candidates for targeted therapies since the standard does not adequately help their care. Some suggested therapeutic targets include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, VEGF, Il-6/STAT3, MET, and HNF-1beta pathways. Better insight into genomic heterogeneity would also provide a personalized approach to identifying treatment targets for clear-cell tumor patients that share similar phenotypes. Developing stronger options is also beneficial because ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths for women and is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers.

<text>Endometrioid tumors are a class of tumors that arise in the uterus or ovaries that resemble endometrial glands on histology. They account for 80% of endometrial carcinomas and 20% of malignant ovarian tumors.

==Ovary==

Ovarian endometrioid tumors are part of the surface epithelial tumor group of ovarian neoplasms (10–20% of which are the endometrioid type).
Benign and borderline variants are rare, as the majority are malignant.
There is an association with endometriosis and concurrent primary endometrial carcinoma (endometrial cancer).

On gross pathological examination, the tumor is cystic and may be solid and some arise in cystic endometriosis. In 40% of cases, endometrioid tumors are found bilaterally.

==Endometrium==
Endometrioid carcinoma can also arise in the endometrium.

Grades 1 and 2 are considered &quot;type 1&quot; endometrial cancer, while grade 3 is considered &quot;type 2&quot;.

==Light microscopy==
Light microscopy shows tubular glands, resembling endometrium.

==Molecular biology==

===CTNNB1 and PTEN mutations===
Ovarian and endometrial endometrioid carcinomas have distinct CTNNB1 and PTEN gene mutation profiles. PTEN mutations are more frequent in low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (67%) compared with low-grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (17%). By contrast, CTNNB1 mutations are significantly different in low-grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (53%) compared with low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (28%). This difference in CTNNB1 mutation frequency may be reflective of the distinct tumoral microenvironments; the epithelial cells lining an endometriotic cyst within the ovary are exposed to a highly oxidative environment that promotes tumorigenesis.

<doc id="1169209" wikidata="Q18557126" url="?curid=1169209" title="Ovarian mucinous tumor">
<text>Mucinous tumors are a type of ovarian tumor. They are typically large.

They are part of the surface epithelial-stromal tumor group of ovarian neoplasms, and account for approximately 36% of all ovarian tumors.
Approximately 75% are benign, 10% are borderline and 15% are malignant.
Rarely, the tumor is seen bilaterally; approximately 5% of primary mucinous tumors are bilateral.

&quot;Benign&quot; mucinous tumors are typically multilocular (have several lobes), and the cysts have a smooth lining of epithelium that resembles endocervical epithelial cells with small numbers of gastrointestinal-type epithelial cells.
&quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;malignant&quot; mucinous tumors often have papillae and solid areas.
There may also be hemorrhage and necrosis.

It is well documented that malignancy may be only focally present in mucinous neoplasms of the ovary, so thorough sampling is imperative.

The major distinguishing features of mucinous tumors are that the tumors are filled with a mucus-like material, which gives them their name; this mucus is produced by mucus-secreting goblet cells very similar to the cells lining normal intestine.

These tumors may become very large, some have been weighed as large as 25 kilograms.

Cystadenocarcinomas (malignant tumors) contain a more solid growth pattern with the hallmarks of malignancy: cellular atypia and stratification, loss of the normal architecture of the tissue, and necrosis. The appearance can look similar to colonic cancer.

Clear stromal invasion is used to differentiate borderline tumors from malignant tumors.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei may present as a result of an ovarian mucinous tumor, however this is a rare cause of this condition, which is a rare condition. A more common cause of pseudomyxoma peritonei is a mucin-producing tumor of the appendix.

Since mucinous tumors arising from the ovary usually only involve one ovary, the presence of involvement in both ovaries with a mucinous tumor suggests that the tumor may have arisen in another location, and further study is warranted.

The risk of mucinous tumors is significantly associated with smoking: relative risk for current smokers 2.22 (2.22 times the risk for non-smokers) and 2.02 for past smokers. Risk is also associated with smoking duration: relative risk per 20 years was 1.44. See article by Tworoger SS in Cancer March 1, 2008 using data from the Nurses Health Study.

==Prognosis==
10-year survival rates for mucinous tumors is excellent in the absence of invasion. 
In the case of borderline tumors confined to the ovary and malignant tumors without invasion, the survival rates are 90% or greater. In invasive mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, the survival is approximately 30%. Survival in metastasis is between 12 and 30 months.

<doc id="1169210" wikidata="Q19000698" url="?curid=1169210" title="Serous tumour">
<text>A serous tumour is a neoplasm that typically has papillary to solid formations of tumor cells with crowded nuclei, and which typically arises on the modified Müllerian-derived serous membranes that surround the ovaries in females. Such ovarian tumors are part of the surface epithelial-stromal tumour group of ovarian tumors. They are common neoplasms with a strong tendency to occur bilaterally, and they account for approximately a quarter of all ovarian tumors.

Rarely, serous tumors arise from within the uterus, notably uterine serous carcinoma, which typically arises in postmenopausal women. Rarely, serous tumors arise from other parts of the peritoneum, including serous primary peritoneal carcinomas. Even more rarely they arise in other body locations, such as the lungs.

==Ovarian serous tumours==
===Low grade ===

The &quot;low grade&quot; classification of serous tumors includes benign and borderline tumors, as well as low grade malignant tumors. Benign serous tumors are distinguished from borderline tumors by the absence of cellular stratification. Stromal invasion distinguishes borderline tumors from low grade malignant tumors. Surgery is curative for benign tumors, and likely curative for other low grade tumors.

Benign serous tumors include serous cystadenomas, cystadenofibromas, and adenofibromas. Benign and borderline serous tumours are commonly unilocular. Benign tumors contain clear fluid and have a smooth lining composed of columnar epithelial cells with cilia. On gross examination, the serous tumor may present as either a cystic lesion in which the papillary epithelium is contained within a few fibrous walled cysts, or the papillary projections may be away from the surface epithelium.
In borderline lesions, the cyst or surface is lined by papillary structures, which are often very complex. Microscopically, stromal papillae are covered by atypical epithelial cells, but stromal invasion is absent, and nuclear stratification is present. 
Approximately 15% of serous tumors are borderline.

In borderline tumors and low grade carcinomas, psammoma bodies are often found. Serous psammocarcinoma is a low grade variant in which massive psammoma bodies are present.

===High grade ===

High grade serous tumors often involve both ovaries. The tumors are solid and cystic with haemorrhage and necrosis. They are morphologically heterogenous. Serous carcinomas often have bulky peritoneal and omental metastases, and spread to the lymph nodes is frequent.

Beginning in the year 2000, the fallopian tube, specifically the fimbriated end, has emerged as an origin for many &quot;ovarian&quot; high-grade serous carcinomas. This discovery has been facilitated by pathology dissection protocols such as the SEE-FIM Protocol, which play close attention to the distal fallopian tube and have revealed early serous cancers and precancers in this region.

Unsurprisingly, 5-year survival decreases as the stage increases.
There is a 25% survival rate with a stage III serous carcinoma.
Staging:
* Stage I - Tumour growth limited to ovaries.
* Stage II - Growth involving one or both ovaries with pelvic extension.
* Stage III - Tumour involving one or both ovaries with implants outside pelvis.
* Stage IV- Tumour involving one or both ovaries with presence of distant metastasis.

=== Epidemiology ===
25% of ovarian tumors and 40% of ovarian cancers are serous tumors. Family history and nulliparity have been identified as risk factors for the disease.

==Uterine serous carcinoma==

&quot;Uterine serous carcinoma&quot; is an uncommon form of endometrial cancer that typically arises in postmenopausal women.
It is typically diagnosed on endometrial biopsy, prompted by post-menopausal bleeding. Unlike the more common low-grade endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, uterine serous carcinoma does not develop from endometrial hyperplasia and is not hormone-sensitive. It arises in the setting of endometrial atrophy and is classified as a type II endometrial cancer.

<text>Surface epithelial-stromal tumors are a class of ovarian neoplasms that may be benign or malignant. Neoplasms in this group are thought to be derived from the ovarian surface epithelium (modified peritoneum) or from ectopic endometrial or fallopian tube (tubal) tissue. Tumors of this type are also called ovarian adenocarcinoma. This group of tumors accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of ovarian cancer; however is mainly only found in postmenopausal women with the exception of the United States where 7% of cases occur in women under the age of 40. Serum CA-125 is often elevated but is only 50% accurate so it is not a useful tumor marker to assess the progress of treatment. 75% of women with epithelial ovarian cancer are found within the advanced-stages; however younger patients are more likely to have better prognoses than older patients. 
==Classification==
Epithelial-stromal tumors are classified on the basis of the epithelial cell type, the relative amounts of epithelium and stroma, the presence of processes, and the location of the epithelial elements. Microscopic pathological features determine whether a surface epithelial-stromal tumor is benign, a borderline tumor, or malignant (evidence of malignancy and stromal invasion). Borderline tumors are of uncertain malignant potential.

This group consists of serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and brenner (transitional cell) tumors, though there are a few mixed, undifferentiated and unclassified types.

===Serous tumors===
*These tumors vary in size from small and nearly imperceptible to large, filling the abdominal cavity.
*Benign, borderline, and malignant types of serous tumors account for about 30% of all ovarian tumors.
*75% are benign or of borderline malignancy, and 25% are malignant
*The malignant form of this tumor, serous cystadenocarcinoma, accounts for approximately 40% of all carcinomas of the ovary and are the most common malignant ovarian tumors. 
*Benign and borderline tumors are most common between the ages of 20 and 50 years.
*Malignant serous tumors occur later in life on average, although somewhat earlier in familial cases.
*20% of benign, 30% of borderline, and 66% of malignant tumors are bilateral (affect both ovaries).

Components can include:
#cystic areas
#cystic and fibrous areas
#predominantly fibrous areas

The chance of malignancy of the tumor increases with the amount of solid areas present, including both papillary structures and any necrotic tissue present.

====Pathology====
*lined by tall, columnar, ciliated epithelial cells
*filled with clear serous fluid
*the term serous which originated as a description of the cyst fluid has come to be describe the particular type of epithelial cell seen in these tumors 
*may involve the surface of the ovary
*the division between benign, borderline, and malignant is ascertained by assessing:
**cellular atypia (whether or not individual cells look abnormal)
**invasion of surrounding ovarian stroma (whether or not cells are infiltrating surrounding tissue)
**borderline tumors may have cellular atypia but do NOT have evidence of invasion
**the presence of psammoma bodies are a characteristic microscopic finding of cystadenocarcinomas

====Prognosis====
The prognosis of a serous tumor, like most neoplasms, depends on 
*degree of differentiation
**this is how closely the tumor cells resemble benign cells
**a well-differentiated tumor closely resembles benign tumors
**a poorly differentiated tumor may not resemble the cell type of origin at all
**a moderately differentiated tumor usually resembles the cell type of origin, but appears frankly malignant
*extension of tumor to other structures
**in particular with serous malignancies, the presence of malignant spread to the peritoneum is important with regard to prognosis.

The five-year survival rate of borderline tumors and malignant tumors confined to the ovaries are 100% and 70% respectively. If the peritoneum is involved, these rates become 90% and 25%.

While the 5-year survival rates of borderline tumors are excellent, this should not be seen as evidence of cure, as recurrences can occur many years later.

===Mucinous tumors===

Mucinous tumors:
*Closely resemble their serous counterparts but unlikely to be bilateral
*Somewhat less common, accounting for about 25% of all ovarian neoplasms
* In some cases mucinous tumors are characterized by more cysts of variable size and a rarity of surface involvement as compared to serous tumors 
*Also in comparison to serous tumors, mucinous tumors are less frequently bilateral, approximately 5% of primary mucinous tumors are bilateral.
*May form very large cystic masses, with recorded weights exceeding 25 kg

====Pathology====
Mucinous tumors are characterized by a lining of tall columnar epithelial cells with apical mucin and the absence of cilia, similar in appearance with benign cervical or intestinal epithelia. The appearance can look similar to colonic or ovarian cancer, but typically originates from the appendix (see mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition Pseudomyxoma peritonei). Clear stromal invasion is used to differentiate borderline tumors from malignant tumors.

====Prognosis====
10-year survival rates for borderline tumors contained within the ovary, malignant tumors without invasion, and invasive malignant tumors are greater than 95%, 90%, and 66%, respectively. One rare but noteworthy condition associated with mucinous ovarian neoplasms is pseudomyxoma peritonei. As primary ovarian mucinous tumors are usually unilateral (in one ovary), the presentation of bilateral mucinous tumors requires exclusion of a non-ovarian origin, usually the appendix.

===Endometrioid tumors===
Endometrioid tumors account for approximately 20% of all ovarian cancers and are mostly malignant (endometrioid carcinomas). They are made of tubular glands bearing a close resemblance to benign or malignant endometrium. 15-30% of endometrioid carcinomas occur in individuals with carcinoma of the endometrium, and these patients have a better prognosis. They appear similar to other surface epithelial-stromal tumors, with solid and cystic areas. 40% of these tumors are bilateral, when bilateral, metastases is often present.

====Pathology====
*Glands bearing a strong resemblance to endometrial-type glands
**Benign tumors have mature-appearing glands in a fibrous stroma
**Borderline tumors have a complex branching pattern without stromal invasion
**Carcinomas (malignant tumors) have invasive glands with crowded, atypical cells, frequent mitoses. With poorer differentiation, the tumor becomes more solid.

====Prognosis====
Prognosis again is dependent on the spread of the tumor, as well as how differentiated the tumor appears. The overall prognosis is somewhat worse than for serous or mucinous tumors, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with tumors confined to the ovary is approximately 75%.

===Clear cell tumors===

Clear cell tumors are characterized by large epithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and may be seen in association with endometriosis or endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary, bearing a resemblance to clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium. They may be predominantly solid or cystic. If solid, the clear cells tend to be arranged in sheets or tubules. In the cystic variety, the neoplastic cells make up the cyst lining.

====Prognosis====
These tumors tend to be aggressive, the five year survival rate for tumors confined to the ovaries is approximately 65%. If the tumor has spread beyond the ovary at diagnosis, the prognosis is poor

===Brenner tumor===

Brenner tumors are uncommon surface-epithelial stromal cell tumors in which the epithelial cell (which defines these tumors) is a transitional cell. These are similar in appearance to bladder epithelia. The tumors may be very small to very large, and may be solid or cystic. Histologically, the tumor consists of nests of the aforementioned transitional cells within surrounding tissue that resembles normal ovary. Brenner tumors may be benign or malignant, depending on whether the tumor cells invade the surrounding tissue.

===Small cell tumors===
Small cell ovarian cancer (SCCO) are generally classified into epithelial tumors associated with distinctive endocrine features.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises SCCO as two distinct entities: Small Cell Ovarian Cancer of Hypercalcemic Type (SCCOHT) and Small Cell Ovarian Cancer of Pulmonary Type (SCCOPT).

Small cell tumours are rare and aggressive, they contribute to less than 2% of all gynaecologic malignancies. The average age of diagnosis is 24 years old, and the majority of patients also present with hypercalcemia (62%). It typically present with a unilateral large tumor. Most women die within a year of diagnosis.

==Treatment==
For more general information, see ovarian cancer.

Research suggests that in the first line treatment of Endometrial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin paired with Carboplatin is a satisfactory alternative to Paclitaxel with Carboplatin. In people with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC, research has found that Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin with Carboplatin is a better treatment than Paclitaxel with Carboplatin. There is also evidence to suggest that Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin with Carboplatin is tolerated better by people with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC.

For advanced cancer of this histology, the US National Cancer Institute recommends a method of chemotherapy that combines intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Preferred chemotherapeutic agents include a platinum drug with a taxane.

==Metastases==
For surface epithelial-stromal tumors, the most common sites of metastasis are the pleural cavity (33%), the liver (26%), and the lungs (3%).

==Effect on fertility==
Fertility subsequent to treatment of surface epithelial-stromal tumors depends mainly on histology and initial
staging to separate it into early borderline (or more benign) versus advanced stages of borderline (or more malignant). Conservative management (without bilateral oophorectomy) of early stage borderline tumors have been estimated to result in chance of over 50% of spontaneous pregnancy with a low risk of lethal recurrence of the tumor (0.5%). On the other hand, in cases of conservative treatment in advanced stage borderline tumors, spontaneous pregnancy rates have been estimated to be 35% and the risk of lethal recurrence 2%.

<text>Farrukhsiyar (; 20 August 16839 April 1719), also spelled as Farrukh Siyar, was the tenth Mughal Emperor from 1713 to 1719. He rose to the throne after deposing his uncle Jahandar Shah. He was an emperor only in name, with all effective power in the hands of the courtier Sayyid brothers. He was born during the reign of his great-grandfather Aurangzeb, as the son of Azim-ush-Shan (the second son of Emperor Bahadur Shah I) and Sahiba Niswan. Reportedly a handsome man who was easily swayed by his advisers, he was said to lack the ability, knowledge and character to rule independently. He was executed by Maharaja Ajit Singh of Marwar.

== Early life ==
Muhammad Farrukhsiyar was born on 20 August 1683 (9th Ramzan 1094 AH) in the city of Aurangabad on the Deccan plateau, to a Kashmiri mother, Sahiba Niswan. He was the second son of Azim-ush-Shan, the Grand son of emperor Bahadur Shah I and a great grandson of emperor Aurangzeb.

In 1696, Farrukhsiyar accompanied his father on his campaign to Bengal. Aurangzeb recalled Azim-ush-Shan from Bengal in 1707 and instructed Farrukhsiyar to take charge of the province. Farrukhsiyar spent his early years governing Dhaka (in present-day Bangladesh) the capital city of Bengal Subah.

In 1712 Azim-ush-Shan anticipated Bahadur Shah I&#x27;s death and a struggle for power, and recalled Farrukhsiyar. He was marching past Azimabad (present-day Patna, Bihar, India) when he learned of the Mughal emperor&#x27;s death. On 21 March, Farrukhsiyar proclaimed his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, issued coinage in his name and ordered &quot;khutba&quot; (public prayer). On 6 April, he learned of his father&#x27;s defeat to an alliance orchestrated by Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung between Jahandar Shah, and his younger brothers Rafi-us-Shan and Jahan Shah. Although the prince considered suicide, he was dissuaded by his friends from Bengal.

== Deposing Jahandar Shah ==
In 1712, Jahandar Shah (Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s uncle) ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire by defeating Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s father, Azim-ush-Shan. Farrukhsiyar wanted revenge for his father&#x27;s death and was joined by Hussain Ali Khan (the &quot;subahdar&quot; of Bengal) and Abdullah Khan, his brother and the &quot;subahdar&quot; of Allahabad.

When they reached Allahabad from Azimabad, Jahandar Shah&#x27;s military general Syed Abdul Ghaffar Khan Gardezi and 12,000 troops clashed with Abdullah Khan, resulting in Abdullah retreating to the Allahabad Fort. However, Gardezi&#x27;s army fled when they learned about his death. After the defeat, Jahandar Shah sent general Khwaja Ahsan Khan and his son Aazuddin. When they reached Khajwah (present-day Fatehpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India), they learned that Farrukhsiyar was accompanied by Hussain Ali Khan and Abdullah Khan. With Abdullah Khan commanding the vanguard, Farrukhsiyar began the attack. After a night-long artillery fight, Aazuddin and Khwaja Ahsan Khan fled and the camp fell to Farrukhsiyar.

On 10 January 1713, Farrukhsiyar and Jahandar Shah&#x27;s forces met at Samugarh, east of Agra in present-day Uttar Pradesh. Jahandar Shah was defeated and imprisoned, and the following day Farrukhsiyar proclaimed himself the Mughal emperor. On 12 February, Farrukhsiyar marched to the Mughal capital of Delhi, capturing the Red Fort and the citadel. Jahandar Shah&#x27;s head, mounted on a bamboo rod, was carried by an executioner on an elephant and his body was carried by another elephant.

== Reign ==
=== Hostility towards the Sayyid Brothers ===


Farrukhsiyar defeated Jahandar Shah with the aid of the Sayyid brothers, and one of the brothers, Abdullah Khan, wanted the post of &quot;wazir&quot; (prime minister). His demand was rejected, since the post was promised to Ghaziuddin Khan, but Farrukhsiyar offered him a post as regent under the name of &quot;wakil-e-mutlaq&quot;. Abdullah Khan refused, saying that he deserved the post of &quot;wazir&quot; since he led Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s army against Jahandar Shah. Farrukhsiyar ultimately gave in to his demand, and Abdullah Khan became &quot;wazir&quot;. His brother Hussain Ali Khan became the &quot;Mir Bakhshi&quot; or Commander-in-Chief.

According to historian William Irvine, Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s close aides Mir Jumla III and Khan Dauran sowed seeds of suspicion in his mind that they might usurp him from the throne. Learning about these developments, the other Sayyid brother (Hussain Ali Khan) wrote to Abdullah Khan: &quot;It was clear, from the Prince&#x27;s talk and the nature of his acts, that he was a man who paid no regard to claims for service performed, one void of faith, a breaker of his word and altogether without shame&quot;. Hussain Ali Khan felt it necessary to act in their interests &quot;without regard to the plans of the new sovereign&quot;. Farrukhsiyar could not confront them, as the Sayyid Brothers maintained control of the strongest part of the army, and thus the latter became de facto rulers of the empire.

=== Campaign against Ajmer ===
Maharaja Ajit Singh of Marwar captured Ajmer with the support of the Marwari nobles and expelled Mughal diplomats from his state. Farrukhsiyar sent Hussain Ali Khan to subjugate him. However, the anti-Sayyid brothers faction in the Mughal emperor&#x27;s court compelled him to send secret letters to Ajit Singh assuring him of rewards if he defeated Hussain Ali Khan. Hussain Ali Khan left Delhi for Ajmer on 6 January 1714, accompanied by Sarbuland Khan and Afrasyab Khan. As his army reached Sarai Sahal, Ajit Singh sent diplomats who failed to negotiate a peace. As Hussain Ali Khan advanced to Ajmer via Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Merta, Ajit Singh retreated to the deserts hoping to dissuade the Mughal general from a battle. Ajit Singh surrendered at Merta. As a result, Mughal authority was restored in Rajputana. Ajit Singh gave his second daughter, Kunwari Indira Kanwar, as a bride to Farrukhsiyar. His son, Kunwar Abhai Singh, was compelled to accompany him to see the Mughal emperor his brother-in-law.

=== Campaign against the Jats ===

Due to Aurangzeb&#x27;s 25-year campaign on the Deccan plateau, Mughal authority weakened in North India with the rise of local rulers. Taking advantage of the situation, the Jats advanced. In early 1713, Farrukhsiyar unsuccessfully sent &quot;subahdar&quot; of Agra, Chabela Ram to defeat the Jat leader Churaman. However, his successor, Samsamud Daulah Khan, compelled Churaman to negotiate with the Mughal emperor. Raja Bahadur Rathore accompanied him to the Mughal court, where negotiations with Farrukhsiyar failed.

In September 1716 Raja Jai Singh II undertook a campaign against Churaman, who lived in Thun (in present-day Rajasthan, India). By 19 November, Jai Singh II began besieging the Thun fort. In December Churaman&#x27;s son, Muhkam Singh, marched from the fort and battled Jai Singh II; the Raja claimed victory. With the Mughals running out of ammunition, Syed Muzaffar Khan was ordered to bring gunpowder, rockets and mounds of lead from the arsenal at Agra.

By January 1718, the siege had lasted for more than a year. With rain coming late in 1717, prices of commodities increased and Raja Jai Singh II found it difficult to continue the siege. He wrote to Farrukhsiyar for reinforcement, saying that he had overcome &quot;many encounters&quot; with the Jats. This failed to impress Farrukhsiyar, so Jai Singh II (via his agent in Delhi) informed Hussain Ali Khan that he would give three million rupees to the government and two million rupees to the minister if he championed his cause to the emperor. With negotiations between Hussain Ali Khan and Farrukhsiyar successful, he accepted his demands and dispatched Syed Khan Jahan to bring Churaman to the Mughal court. Farrukhsiyar issued a &quot;farman&quot; (royal decree) to Raja Jai Singh II, thanking him for the siege.

On 19 April 1718, Churaman was presented to Farrukhsiyar; they negotiated for peace, with Churaman accepting Mughal authority. Khan Jahan was given the title of &quot;Bahadur&quot; (&quot;brave&quot;). It was decided that Churaman would pay five million rupees in cash and goods to Farrukhsiyar via Syed Abdullah.

=== Campaign against the Sikhs ===
Banda Singh Bahadur was a Sikh leader who, by early 1710s, had captured parts of the Punjab region. Mughal emperors Bahadur Shah I and Jahandar Shah failed to suppress Banda&#x27;s uprising.

In 1714, the Sirhind &quot;faujdar&quot; (garrison commander) Zainuddin Ahmad Khan attacked the Sikhs near Ropar. In 1715, Farrukhisyar sent 20,000 troops under Qamaruddin Khan, Abdus Samad Khan and Zakariya Khan Bahadur to defeat Bahadur. After an eight-month siege at Gurdaspur, Banda Singh Bahadur surrendered after he ran out of ammunition. Banda Singh Bahadur and his 200 companions were arrested and brought to Delhi; he was paraded around the city of Sirhind.

Banda Singh Bahadur was put into an iron cage and the remaining Sikhs were chained. They were pressured to give up their faith and become Muslims. Although the emperor promised to spare the Sikhs who converted to Islam, according to William Irvine &quot;not one prisoner proved false to his faith&quot;. On their firm refusal all were ordered to be executed. The Sikhs were brought to Delhi in a procession with the 780 Sikh prisoners, 2,000 Sikh heads hung on spears, and 700 cartloads of heads of slaughtered Sikhs used to terrorise the population. When Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s army reached the Red Fort, the Mughal emperor ordered Banda Singh Bahadur, Baj Singh, Fateh Singh and their companions to be imprisoned in Tripolia. After three months of confinement, on 19 June 1716 Farrukhsiyar had Banda Singh Bahadur and his followers executed, despite the wealthy Khatris of Delhi offering money for his release. Banda Singh Bahadur&#x27;s eyes were gouged out, his limbs were severed, his skin removed, and then he was killed.

=== Campaign against rebels at the Indus River ===
Shah Inayat was the leader of poor peasants of Sindh who led a decisive movement against zamindars of Sindh and redistributed land among poor peasants and tillers. He was executed on the order of Emperor Farrukhsiyar in the early eighteenth century.

===Re-Imposition of Jizyah===
Farrukhsiyar gave power to a number of Kashmiri nobles such as Inayatullah Kashmiri, an old Alamgiri noble, and Muhammad Murad Kashmiri, who he was related to by marriage. This was because he needed a close party of supporters who were directly related to him in dealing with the Sayyid brothers. Inayatullah Khan was appointed the Diwan-i-Tan-o Khalisa, and the governor of Kashmir in 1717. He set fire to the Hindu area of Srinagar and forbade the Pandits from wearing turbans. Inayatullah Khan was further responsible for the re-imposition of Jizyah in the Mughal Empire after the death of Aurangzeb. Farrukhsiyar said to the Hindus:
&quot;Inayatullah has placed before me a letter from the Sherif of Mecca urging that the collection of jizya is obligatory according to our Holy book. In a matter of faith, I am powerless to interfere.&quot;
=== Trade concession in Bengal ===
In 1717, Farrukhsiyar issued a &quot;farman&quot; giving the British East India Company the right to reside and trade in the Mughal Empire. They were allowed to trade freely, except for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees, in gratitude for William Hamilton, a surgeon associated with the company, curing Farrukhsiyar of a disease. The company was given the right to issue &quot;dastak&quot; (passes) for the movement of goods, which was misused by company officials for personal gain. The &quot;farman&quot; allowed the British East India company to carry out duty-free trade in the province of Bengal. They were given &quot;dastaks&quot; (passes), which were misused by the employees of the Company. The &quot;dastaks&quot; were used for their own private trade, angering the Nawab of Bengal, Alivardi Khan.

=== Final struggle with the Sayyid Brothers ===

By 1715, Farrukhsiyar had given Mir Jumla III the power to sign documents on his behalf: &quot;The word and seal of Mir Jumla are my word and seal&quot;. Mir Jumla III began approving proposals for &quot;jagirs&quot; and &quot;mansabs&quot; without consulting Syed Abdullah, the prime minister. Syed Abdullah&#x27;s deputy Ratan Chand accepted bribes for him to do work and was involved in revenue farming, which was forbidden by the Mughal emperor. Taking advantage of the situation, Mir Jumla III told Farrukhsiyar that the Sayyids were unfit to hold office and accused them of insubordination. Hoping to depose the brothers, Farrukhsiyar began making military preparations and increased the number of soldiers under Mir Jumla III and Khan Dauran.

After Syed Hussain learned about Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s plans, he felt that their position could be cemented by controlling &quot;important provinces&quot;. He asked to be appointed viceroy of the Deccan, instead of Asaf Jah I; Farrukhsiyar refused, transferring him to the Deccan instead. Fearing attack by Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s supporters, the brothers began making military preparations. Although Farrukhsiyar initially considered giving the task of crushing the brothers to Mohammad Amin Khan (who wanted the position of prime minister in return), he decided against it because removing him would be difficult.

Arriving at the Deccan, Syed Hussain made a treaty with Maratha ruler Shahu I in February 1718. Shahu was allowed to collect &quot;sardeshmukhi&quot; in Deccan, and received the lands of Berar and Gondwana to govern. In return, Shahu agreed to pay one million rupees annually and maintain an army of 15,000 horses for the Sayyids. This agreement was reached without Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s approval, and he was angry when he learned about it: &quot;It was not proper for the vile enemy to be overbearing partners in matters of revenue and government.&quot;

=== State of the Mughal Empire ===
==== Appointments ====
Farrukhsiyar appointed Sayid Abdullah Khan as chief minister and placed Muhammad Baqir Mutamid Khan in charge of the Exchequer. The title of &quot;bakshi&quot; was first conferred on Hussain Ali Khan (with the titles of Umdat-ul-Mulk, Amir-ul-umara and Bahadur Firuz Jung) and then to Chin Qilich Khan and Afrasayab Khan Bahadur.

The following were governors of the provinces; the governor of South India was Chin Qilich Khan, who appointed deputy governors:
== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s first wife was Fakhr-Un-Nissa Begum, also known as Gauhar-Un-Nissa, the daughter of Mir Muhammad Taqi (known as Hasan Khan and then Sadat Khan). Taqi, from the Persian province of Mazandaran, married the daughter of Masum Khan Safawi; if she was the mother of Fakhr-un-nissa, this would account for her daughter&#x27;s selection as the prince&#x27;s wife.

His second wife was Bai Indira Kanwar, the daughter of Maharajah Ajit Singh. She married Farrukhsiyar on 27 September 1715, during the fourth year of his reign, and they had no children. After Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s deposition and death she left the imperial harem on 16 July 1719, she returned to her father with her property and lived her remaining years in Jodhpur.

Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s third wife was Bai Bhup Devi, daughter of Jaya Singh (the Raja of Kishtwar, who had converted to Islam and received the name of Bakhtiyar Khan). After Jaya Singh&#x27;s death he was succeeded by his son, Kirat Singh. In 1717, in response to a message from the Mufti of Delhi, her brother Kirat Singh sent her to Delhi with her brother Mian Muhammad Khan. Farrukhsiyar married her, and she entered the imperial harem on 3 July 1717.

=== Titles ===
His full name was Abul Muzaffer Muinuddin Muhammad Farrukhsiyar Badshah.
Posthumously, he was known as &quot;Shahid-i-marhum&quot; (the martyr received with mercy).

=== Coinage ===
On coins issued during Farrukhsiyar&#x27;s reign, the following phrase was inscribed: &quot;Sikka zad az fazl-i-Haq bar sim o zar/ Padshah-i-bahr-o-bar Farrukhsiyar&quot; (By the grace of the true God, struck on silver and gold, the emperor of land and sea, Farrukhsiyar).
There are 116 coins from his reign on display at the Lahore Museum and the Indian Museum in Kolkata. The coins were minted in Kabul, Kashmir, Ajmer, Allahabad, Bidar and Berar.

== Deposition and death ==

With the help of Ajit Singh and Marathas, Farrukhsiyar was blinded, imprisoned and then executed by the Sayyid Brothers in 1719.

He was tortured in much brutual way, as he tortured Banda Singh Bahadur and the 700 Sikhs.
His eyes were gouged off,
resources say the first try was failed so he have to bear much pain. 

He was stripped off paraded in Delhi street in the same way he did with Banda Singh Bahdur.He was captivated for months and his skin was peeled off and limbs were cut one by one. He was starved and hence he became weak, and finally he was strangled to death.

 Upon his death, Ajit Singh reclaimed his widowed daughter along with dowry and returned to Jodhpur.

== Legacy ==
The town of Farrukhnagar in Gurgaon district, south of Delhi, was named for him. During his reign, he built a &quot;Sheesh Mahal&quot; (palace) and a Jama Masjid (mosque) there.

The town of Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh was also named after him.

<doc id="1169228" wikidata="Q1205690" url="?curid=1169228" title="King Pellinore">
<text>King Pellinore (alternatively &quot;Pellinor&quot;, &quot;Pellynore&quot; and other variants) is the king of Listenoise (possibly the Lake District) or of &quot;the Isles&quot; (possibly Anglesey, or perhaps the medieval kingdom of the same name) in Arthurian legend. In the tradition from the Old French prose, he is associated with the Questing Beast and is the slayer of King Lot. His many children include the sons Aglovale, Lamorak, and Percival, and the daughter Dindrane.

== In medieval literature ==
Pellinore is a major figure in the 13th-century Post-Vulgate prose cycle and the sections of Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; based on it. There, as son of King Pellam and brother of Kings Pelles (the Fisher King) and Alain, he is most famous for his endless hunt of the Questing Beast, which he is tracking when King Arthur first meets him. Though he claims his bloodline is destined perpetually to chase this bizarre monster, Sir Palamedes the Saracen takes up the quest, and, according to one version, slays the beast. 

Pellinore beats King Arthur after three jousts and breaks the sword Arthur had withdrawn from the stone (in some versions this is Excalibur, though he gets another sword of that name from the Lady of the Lake soon after). Merlin throws a spell of enchantment on Pellinore to save Arthur&#x27;s life. Arthur praises Pellinore&#x27;s skill, and they soon become friends, with Arthur inviting him to join the Round Table. Pellinore then helps Arthur in his early wars against rebelling vassals, but when he kills King Lot of Orkney during the Battle of Tarabel (or Dimilioc), he sparks a blood feud between his and Lot&#x27;s family that results in his death by Gawain and his brothers and the deaths of many others. 

Pellinore was said to have been of the royal line of Joseph of Arimathea, whose dynasty guards the Holy Grail, according to Arthurian lore. In the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, Pellinore is called the &quot;Maimed King&quot; after being wounded by a holy spear, having doubted the powers of the Grail.

Pellinore has many legitimate and illegitimate children. His sons Tor, Aglovale, Lamorak, Dornar, and Percival all eventually join the Round Table as well. It is Percival, who was one of the first Grail seekers, and his grand nephew, Galahad, who finally succeeds in the quest. His daughter, Percival&#x27;s sister, sometimes known as Dindrane, becomes a servant of the Grail and helps them achieve the mystical objective as the &quot;Grail heroine&quot;. Another of his daughters, Alyne, dies early when he, not knowing it is her, ignores her pleas for help while hurrying to retrieve Nimue from her abductor at the behest of Arthur.

== In modern fiction ==
* In T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, he is a bumbling but endearing old man who cannot give up his search for the &quot;Questin&#x27; Beast&quot; lest the poor creature die of loneliness. He also tends to say the word &quot;what&quot; after his sentences (Merlyn makes fun of him by stating: &quot;…Or, if I were King Pellinore, I would say &#x27;what what, what?&#x27;&quot;) In White&#x27;s novel, Pellinore is vengefully put to death by Sir Gawain and/or his brothers, for unintentionally killing their father, King Lot of Orkney, in a jousting match.
**He appears in the 1963 Walt Disney Studios film adaptation of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, where he is voiced by actor Alan Napier, and his name being spelled as Pelinore. A friend of Sir Ector, he announces the jousting tournament that will be held in London, with the winner being crowned king. Pelinore is mild-mannered, and wise, appalled at the idea of Kay being king due to his bitter nature. He is one of the first to recognise the sword pulled by Arthur from the stone. He, also along with another knight, Sir Bart, stands up for Arthur, and encourages the boy to successfully remove the sword from the stone.
* In the musical &quot;Camelot&quot;, Pellinore (or &quot;Pelly&quot;, as he is often called by Arthur) is a comical, much-loved, permanent guest of Arthur and Guinevere. He is however, somewhat unsure of Arthur&#x27;s new ideas for a new order of chivalry, being against &quot;...&quot;any&quot; new ideas&quot; on principle. Pellinore is still with Arthur before Arthur fights his final battle at the end of the play/film; and when Arthur knights the young boy &quot;Tom of Warwick&quot;.
* In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, Pellinore is represented as an old mad man, kept in a cage and commanding imaginary armies. After King Gundleus&#x27; sacking of the Tor at Ynys Wydryn (Avalon), Pellinore is retrieved from the Tor by Arthur&#x27;s men and taken to Caer Cadarn, where he is locked in a store room. While there, Owain argues that he should be sent to the Isle of the Dead, however when Arthur decides to rebuild the Tor, Pellinore is sent back with Nimue and Morgan to continue his life as before.

<text>Kabir Suman (; born as Suman Chattopadhyay; 16 March 1949) is an Indian singer-songwriter, musician, music director, music composer, writer, actor, politician, and former journalist. He shot to fame in the 1990s with Bengali albums such as &quot;Tomake Chai&quot; (&quot;I Want You&quot;) and &quot;Boshe Anko&quot; (&quot;Sit-and-Draw&quot;). Suman has won a National Film Award for Best Music Direction for his work in &quot;Jaatishwar&quot; (2014).

From May 2009 to 2014, he was a member of parliament of India in the 15th Lok Sabha, having been elected from the Jadavpur constituency in West Bengal, from Trinamool Congress.

== Early life and musical career ==

Suman was born in a Bengali Hindu Brahmin family on 16 March 1949 to Sudhindranath and Uma Chattopadhyay at Cuttack, Odisha. He started his training in classical music at a very young age, under the tutelage of his father. He studied at St. Lawrence High School, Kolkata. He graduated with an honours in English Literature from Jadavpur University and did a diploma in the French language and the German language.

Around 1968, while learning Himangshu Dutta compositions, he felt that in spite of their compositional strength, they did not represent the contemporary times, lyrically.

Kabir Suman&#x27;s first studio recording was in 1972. It was released from Hindusthan Records. His second single vinyl record was published in 1973, from the same label. Both these records were commercially unsuccessful.

After resigning from All India Radio he joined a clerical post at United Bank of India. Kabir Suman shifted to France temporarily to teach the basics of Indian Classical Music in 1973. It is said in one of his autobiographies, that in France he was first introduced to the songs of Bob Dylan and he claimed Dylan&#x27;s songs left a great impression and influence on him.

Kabir Suman went to West Germany on 12 May 1975.. At the end of 1975, Voice of Germany opened a Bengali department in Cologne, and he applied for a job there. They gave him some translation work, and he gradually became a regular freelancer for the Voice of Germany&#x27;s Bengali division.

In May 1979, Suman returned to Kolkata and he started to work as a teacher of German at Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, and the Max Mueller Bhavan.

He started working in the Bengali daily Aajkal as a part-timer, and also contributed to the Desh until 1980. He joined a band called &quot;Samatan&quot;. However, this band was unsuccessful and the members broke up very soon. Some members of Samatan and some new members, all in their twenties and thirties joined him to establish a new band called &#x27;Nagarik : Anya Katha Anya Gan&#x27;. During this time Suman completed his first song (written in 1975) &quot;E Kemon Akash Dekhale Tumi&quot;.

During this time Suman went to the US in to work for Voice of America. While working for Voice of America, Suman went to Nicaragua during Sandinista Revolution. He also wrote for &quot;Desh&quot; magazine under the pseudonym Manab Mitra during this time and also started writing in the &#x27;Frontier&#x27; magazine.

Suman returned to Kolkata in early 1985. He bought many instruments, applicable for a complete recording studio, which were sent to Kolkata by ship. After returning to Kolkata, he rejoined with &#x27;Nagarik&#x27; with some new vocalists and instrumentalists, and continued writing and composing songs, thinking mainly as group songs.

=== Breakup of Nagorik ===
From early 1986, &#x27;Nagorik&#x27; started swinging due to clash of personality. Kabir Suman created some songs at that time like &quot;Hariye Jeo Na&quot;, &quot;Tomake Chai&quot; (finally published in 1992), &quot;Aro Balo Aro Katha&quot; (partially published in 1992), &quot;Machhi O Mara Mukher Gan&quot;, &quot;Najehal Akashta&quot;, &quot;Robbar&quot; (finally published in 1994), &quot;Tumi Gan Gaile (finally sung by Indranil Sen and published in 2002), &quot;Ganahatyar Nam Bhopal&quot;, &quot;Tirikshi Mejajer Je Lokta&quot;, &quot;Abhibadan&quot; (finally published in 1994) etc. His initial compositions were created keeping the group in mind. The group consisted of amateur singers and their aptitude was limited. Members of Nagorik recorded some of his songs on cassette tape, the entire recording was planned domestically in his home at Baishnabghata. Kabir Suman himself had written, composed, sung and played electronic keyboard on the recording. There were some other vocalists and instrumentalists, instruments included guitar and percussions. The entire recording was done by his four track tape recorder, where live vocals and live instruments were recorded in two tracks by all vocalists, and Kabir Suman himself added more electronic sounds on the rest of the two tracks by playing synthesizer. His book &quot;Mukta Nicaragua&quot; about Sandinista revolution was published by K.P. Bagchi Publication at that time (republished many years later), but another book &quot;Anya America&quot; failed to get published. He also recorded some information and song about Sandinista Revolution at that time. During this time he constructed a recording studio named &#x27;Sing To Live&#x27; inside an abandoned factory near Bansdroni.

=== 1986–1989: In West Germany ===
Kabir Suman was not sure about the future of his created songs, and also not interested to involve in a general job. He thought if he could go to a foreign country as an employee, he could buy many electronic music instruments. Thinking thus, he went to West Germany again in September 1986, and before departure he recorded another album of &#x27;Nagarik&#x27;, following the procedure just written before, but this time in the new studio he constructed.

==== Learning guitar ====
After reaching West Germany, he started learning classical guitar. During this time he felt that guitar is a simple instrument, which could be played by a solo musician, and there is no question about any type of multi-instrument orchestra. Also a guitar makes a man moving-minded. Under an Italian teacher, he started learning guitar, with Finger-style, sight-reading, listening many guitarists&#x27; records like Andrés Segovia, Julian Bream etc., and also started learning jazz guitar &amp; blues guitar. He then started song creation on guitar, like &quot;Hal Chherho Na Bandhu&quot; (finally published in 1992), &quot;Gan-ola&quot; (finally published in 1994), etc. These guitar based songs started influencing of Baul, Bhawaiya, Kirtan, Folk, Blues and also some Ragas.

Suman returned to Kolkata in early 1989. He bought many instruments like before, this time both keyboard and guitar.

=== Struggling as a newcomer musician ===
After returning to Kolkata, he saw &#x27;Nagarik&#x27; has almost disbanded because of ego-clash, and the studio is also in a sinking mood. He decided to be a solo professional singer-songwriter and musician, and thought to work in some advertisement business, but nothing materialized. During this time he wrote some songs like &quot;Tin Shataker Shahar&quot;, &quot;Chena Duhkha Chena Sukh&quot; (finally published in 1992), &quot;Pratham Sabkichhu&quot; (finally published in 1994) etc.

==== First public performance with own song ====
In February 1990, a singer named Raju Bal took a gentleman Indranil Gupta to Suman&#x27;s house. Indranil listened the &quot;Tin Shataker Shahar&quot; and liked it, and told Suman that Kolkata Festival was being held in Yuba Bharati Krirangan remembering the so-called tri-centenary celebration of Kolkata City, and that song relates with this, so he should sing this song at that festival.
He felt nervous because he was performing on stage after 17 years, and he was completely unknown, with his style. He sang &quot;Tin Shataker Shahar&quot; with guitar, then &quot;Tomake Chai&quot; and finally &quot;Amader Janya&quot; – both with electronic keyboard. The audiences became highly appreciative about his songs and music after hearing three songs and started applauding seeking encore. Kabir Suman felt very happy to realize that his song got the favour of the general public, and became optimistic. He started to practise his voice with the help of electronic tanpura, continued keyboard and guitar playing, and also creating songs with some contemporary incidents. Kabir Suman performed first time as a professional singer in December 1990. He got appreciation from Dr. Barin Roy, Gour Kishor Ghosh, Ashis Chattopadhay etc. Shubhendu Maity helped him by giving him a chance to perform in some concerts. His songs have not impressed the rural people, but urban and suburban people appreciated them very much. He also sang at some political meetings of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). During this time some controversy arose over one of his songs &quot;Anita Dewan&quot;.

==== Solo live performance ====
Kabir Suman performed his first solo live performance on 5 May 1991 at Shishir Mancha. Many magazines and newspapers were invited, like &quot;Aajkal&quot;, &quot;Desh&quot;, &quot;Business Standard&quot;, &quot;The Statesman&quot;, and they reviewed it. &#x27;Desh&#x27; first labeled his songs as &#x27;Sumaner Gan&#x27;, which popularized his songs after this time and still now.

But although those reviews were positive, not many invitations other from than his friend circle happened. He performed in some live programs with the help of his friends. All those were very unsure, and Kabir Suman also was not optimistic at that time about his eligibility. Many people of advertisement business got him to do jingles or theme songs including &quot;Lexpo 1991&quot;, but some of them either gave him not a single penny, others gave him very little money, despite the fact that Kabir Suman made all this work completely alone with writing, composing, singing, playing instruments, recording, and mixing. Some advised him to go to Mumbai for some professional work, but he refused it.

He went to Doordarshan Kendra Kolkata for some work, but he was refused. He went to Akashbani Bhawan Kolkata, and applied with the help of his friend and famous newsreader Tarun Chakrabarty. Ultimately he sang some of his own songs and some songs of Rabindra Nath Tagore, after 16 years, on the radio. In 1991 he went to film director Tarun Majumdar for some work in soundtrack. Tarun Majumder listened to some of his songs, and selected &quot;Pratham Sabkichhu&quot; to use in one of his upcoming films &#x27;Abhimane Anurage&#x27;, although he requested Suman to change some of his lyrics to match with the theme of that movie. The song was recorded in February 1992. Kabir Suman himself played guitar, Pratap Roy played synthesizer, and Samir Khasnabis played bass guitar. Unfortunately the film was not completed, and so the song was also not released.

==== First solo album ====
Shubhendu Maity told Mr. Somnath Chattopadhyay, one of the officials of The Gramophone Company of India about the songs of Kabir Suman, and after Shubhendu&#x27;s request, Suman sent some songs to Somnath after home recording. Ravi Kichlu, the head of the product development division of that company welcomed Suman, and showed interest to record his songs. Kabir suman felt very happy and surprised after listening to this, and asked Ravi about the reason for it, Ravi Kichlu told him – &quot;I will be doing a service to Indian Music&quot;. The recording started after some days in early 1992.

==== Tomake Chai ====
Kabir Suman recorded 12 songs for his first album, named &#x27;Tomake Chai&#x27;, which was published in April 1992. In many aspects, it was a milestone in the history of Bangla Song. It was the first Bengali Basic Song Album which was entirely written, composed, sung and musical instruments played by the artist himself. It was the first Bengali Basic Song Album which was recorded with the help of a four track tape recorder.

On thé first pressing, it did not sell well, but after the 2nd pressing, it gained a huge success, and was a big hit. With its offbeat lyric, and instrumentation, it drew a great attention of the listeners, and ultimately it got Platinum Disc.

=== Musical life ===
Kabir Suman, recorded a number of albums between 1992 and 1999 under the name Suman Chattopadhyay or Suman Chatterjee. He returned to the recording industry again in 2001, and this time as Kabir Suman.

His contemporary urban, socially conscious songs draw upon both Bengali &quot;adhunik&quot; (modern) and Western folk and protest music. His work has been a major influence in the development of the Bengali songs. It has influenced bands like Chandrabindoo, and has grown to become a major movement in contemporary Bengali music. Most of his songs are played solo with just a Piano, electronic keyboard or a guitar. Like many other Bengali singers, Suman recorded albums of Rabindra Sangeet (Songs of Rabindranath Tagore), starting in the late-1990s. 

He released his first solo album, &quot;Tomake Chai&quot;, on 23 April 1992, which was immensely successful as it redefined Bengali songs. Later Suman stopped making songs for general audience and focused on more political issues.

==== Basic song albums with his &#x27;own created-own sung&#x27; songs ====
In April 1992, Suman published his first album &#x27;Tomake Chai&#x27;, which had twelve songs. He sang, wrote and composed all those songs. Except three songs, all songs were accompanied by either electronic keyboard, or acoustic guitar, or both (mixed by a four track tape recorder and hardware sequencer) by him alone; those three songs were accompanied by tabla and percussion by other artists. The song &quot;Tomake Chai&quot; is the most famous track of the album. This continued to next album &#x27;Bosey Anko&#x27;, published in March 1992 along with twelve songs again. Unlike previous album, which was mostly accompanied by electronic keyboard and multi track mixed sound electronically, &#x27;Bosey Anko&#x27; was recorded directly without any complex mixing except one song, which was mixed with both guitar and keyboard (and also with tabla and percussion). Most songs were recorded with a simple acoustic guitar, only two songs with an electronic keyboard, and four songs were accompanied by a sarod, tabla and percussion by other artists. This second album was also a big hit, and popularized Suman so much, that he was obliged to record his third album on the same year.

From his third album &#x27;Ichchhe Holo&#x27;, he started recording his basic albums annually as a &#x27;Puja Album&#x27; like other artists during August of each year, until 1999. &#x27;Ichchhe Holo&#x27; contained 14 songs, the first of such basic Bengali song albums. Unlike two previous albums, electronic keyboard was completely unused in this album. Most songs were completely accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar, and 4 songs were accompanied by sarod, santur, tabla and percussion by other artists. This fully acoustic music arrangement drew attention to many music-lovers, and it was such an album, which was completely electric or electronic music instrument less almost after 40 years in Bengali music history. It was also his first album which the front cover does not have a picture of himself.

In 1994, Suman recorded his 4th album &#x27;Gan-ola&#x27;, which contained 15 songs. He broke his own record, and also the record of Bengali music history because it was the first of such basic Bengali song album which contains such number of songs. By this album, he returned with his electronic music era again, with an updated, state-of-the art electronic keyboard with arranger facility. It was also his first album, where no other musicians played. All 15 songs were accompanied by either electronic keyboard, or acoustic guitar, among these, two songs were recorded with both guitar and harmonica. Some people believe that he had not used keyboard in any of his songs after &#x27;Bosey Anko&#x27; – because he continued to practice this new keyboard, which was finally recorded in &#x27;Gan-ola&#x27;. It was his second album in which the front cover does not have any picture of himself. His electronic music supremacy developed further on his next album &#x27;Ghumo Baundule&#x27;. Although the number of songs reduced from 15 to 13, but it was another album, which was entirely accompanied by his musical instruments. In this album, all songs were accompanied with electronic keyboard, harmonica, acoustic guitar and electric guitar combination. It was also the first time in Bengali music history. All these mixing were done by both four track tape recorder, and hardware sequencer, which was unique and very hard to do.

1996 saw a big departure of Suman&#x27;s music, because, in this year, his 6th album &#x27;Chaichhi Tomar Bondhuta&#x27; published. It contained again 15 songs like &#x27;Gan-ola&#x27;, but the main exception is that it was the first and only basic album of Suman, where a music arranger, named Amit Bandopadhyay, arranged the instrumental part. Only 3 songs were accompanied by Suman&#x27;s acoustic guitar, but other songs were accompanied by session musicians, with santoor, sarod, violin, tabla, dhol, drum pad, electronic keyboard, guitar and bass guitar. Also for the first time, some male and female background vocalists were used in some songs. Many hardcore Suman fans criticized and disliked this music, which was not alike with his previous albums.

However, in 1997, Suman returned again to his own instrumental music by his 7th album &#x27;Jaatishwar&#x27;. It contained 12 songs again after &#x27;Bosey Anko&#x27;, and also like &#x27;Bosey Anko&#x27; – most songs was recorded with a simple guitar, (this time with an electric guitar), only 2 songs with electronic keyboard, 1 song with keyboard, guitar and drums, another song with piano, guitar and harmonica, and 2 songs were accompanied by sarod, santoor, tabla and drums by other artists. The title song &#x27;Jaatishwar&#x27; inspired then young Srijit Mukherjee, and he made a Bengali feature film with the same name in 2013.

In 1998, Suman published his 8th album &#x27;Nishiddho Istehar&#x27;, which was a stark contrast with his 3rd album &#x27;Ichchhe Holo&#x27;. Where &#x27;Ichchhe Holo&#x27; completely omitted electronic keyboard, &#x27;Nishiddho Istehar&#x27; was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard. It was one of the complex electronic music recording in Bengali music industry, where all 14 songs were accompanied by complex-customized electronic sound. After &#x27;Ghumo Baundule&#x27;, it was the first album where no other musicians played. This continued to his 9th album &#x27;Pagla Sanai&#x27;, which was published in 1999. Only 2 songs were accompanied by simple acoustic guitar, and 2 were with sanai and tabla by other artists. All other songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, and hardware drum programmer. Suman used both instruments very complexly, and created a complex orchestration alone. After this album, his next album was published again in 2001, after a long gap.

==== Basic song albums with his &#x27;own created-others sung&#x27; songs ====
Beside himself, some other artists have recorded his songs. It first happened in 1995, when Haimanti Shukla recorded an album &#x27;Sobujer Pratishodh&#x27;, which contained 8 songs. Amit Bandopadhyay arranged the instrumental music with many session musicians. Some female background vocalists were used in some songs. It continued in the next year, 1996 when Suman created an album &#x27;Chhoto Boro Miley&#x27; with 14 songs. It was his first album mainly for children. Along with Anjan Dutt, Nachiketa Chakraborty, Lopamudra Mitra &amp; Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, some child singers sang most songs either single or as group, or as collaborative with those famous singers. Amit Bandopadhyay was also arranger here, but in 3 songs. Kabir Suman played acoustic guitar and harmonic in this album.

In 1999, there was another children song album &#x27;Eksathe Banchboi&#x27; with 12 songs. Unlike &#x27;Chhoto Boro Miley&#x27;, here no other famous singers sang. All songs were sung by child singers, although they were not same of those in &#x27;Chhoto Boro Miley&#x27; (except Payel Kar, who was in both albums). Also in this album, all songs were accompanied with electronic keyboard, and hardware drum programmer by Suman. Suman used both instruments very complexly, and created an ethereal orchestration alone. He also sang 3 songs collaboratively with those child singers, and he says that it was his best artistic work till now. In this year, another album published named &#x27;Achena Chhuti&#x27;, which contained 14 songs, where Suman sang with Sabina Yasmin. Some songs were sung by Suman, some by Sabina, and some as duet. The entire instrumentation was done by Suman. Only two songs were accompanied with guitar and harmonica, rest of the songs were accompanied completely with electronic keyboard, and sometimes with harmonica, like &#x27;Nishiddha Istehar&#x27;. It was his first basic song album, where complete lyrics of the songs were printed in its album cover. It was his last collaborative album as &#x27;Suman Chatterjee&#x27;. Initially it was published only as cassette, but later also as CD. It was his first album which was published from a recording company other than SAREGAMA India Limited; it was published from Raga Music.

==== Motion picture soundtrack ====
In 1994, Kabir Suman debuted his Soundtrack music career. In this year, he wrote, composed, sung, and even played a cameo role in a Bengali film Mahasangram, which contained 6 songs. Amit Bandopadhyay arranged the instrumental music with many session musicians for all songs but one, where Suman played his guitar and harmonica only. Here Suman sang with Indrani Sen. Some songs were sung by Suman, some by Indrani, and some as duet. Background score was also done by Suman. Unfortunately the motion picture released after a long 12 years gap, in 2006, and was flop.

In 1997, Suman became music director again in a Bengali film Sedin Chaitramas, which contained 7 songs. Unlike Mahasangram, Suman played all instruments like electronic keyboard, guitar and harmonica and himself was an arranger like his basic albums. It was his first soundtrack where he worked with own instruments. Beside Suman, other singers in this album were Nachiketa Chakrabarty, Lopamudra Mitra &amp; Swagata Lakshmi Das Gupta. Background score was also done by Suman. It became a hit for both the movie and soundtrack, and Kabir Suman received BFJA award as best music director. It continued to next year when he became music director again in a Bengali film Suryakanya, which contained 6 songs. Unlike two previous films, he did not direct the background score here. Suman played all instruments like electronic keyboard, guitar and harmonica and himself was an arranger like his basic albums. Beside Suman, other singers were Shrikanta Acharya, Shriradha Bandopadhyay &amp; Swagata Lakshmi Das Gupta. The movie was a flop.

==== Songs created by Rabindra Nath Tagore ====
Kabir Suman started his music career with Rabindra Nath Tagore&#x27;s song in 1972, but it was almost unsuccessful. He recorded Tagore&#x27;s song again 1994, after a long gap, this time he was already a popular singer. From 1994 to 1997, he recorded Tagore&#x27;s Song each year as albums. These were published as &#x27;Tumi Sandhyar Meghamala&#x27; in 1994, &#x27;Pathik Ami` in 1995, &#x27;Priyar Chhaya` in 1996 and &#x27;Chirabhakta` in 1997. In first three albums, music was arranged by V Balsara, Amit Bandopadhyay and again V. Balsara respectively. In the album &#x27;Chirabhakta&#x27;, 7 songs were arranged by Amit Bandopadhyay, but rest 5 songs was sung by Suman with only a simple acoustic guitar, which was unique in the history of Tagore&#x27;s song recording, and it was also permitted by Vishwa Bharati Music Board.

==== Songs composed by Himangshu Dutta ====
1n 1995, Kabir Suman recorded an album which contained 10 songs, that were composed by Surasagar Himangshu Dutta, around 1940. All these songs were written by different lyricists. During its recording, Pete Seeger&#x27;s 12 string guitar was played by guitarist Buddhadeb Gangopadhyay.

After 1999, he returned in recording industry again in 2001, and this time as Kabir Suman.

==== Concert With Pete Seeger ====

One of Suman&#x27;s greatest critical success, was his concert at Kalamandir in Kolkata with American folk icon Pete Seeger, in 1996.

==== Basic song albums with his own created songs from 2001 ====
After a long gap throughout 2000, Kabir Suman returned to recording career again in January 2001, by publishing his 10th album &#x27;Jabo Awchenay&#x27;, which contained 10 songs. It was his first concept album about holiday, leave, vacation. Its theme contained &#x27;leave&#x27; in many aspects like vacation, death, lost youth, holiday, break etc. After &#x27;Nishiddho Istehar&#x27;, this was his second album, which was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard, except the last song, which was played with an acoustic piano. This was his first album, where there were some lyric reading, without any music and tune. There were such 6 lyrics. Kabir Suman had already changed his name from Suman Chattopadhyay to Kabir Suman, but the recording company still used his old name primarily, and his new name within brackets. The cover art was also a photograph of old days when he had hair, beard and moustache, where during that time, practically there were nothing to him.

Next year, Kabir Suman published his 11th album &#x27;Adab&#x27;, which contained 12 songs. This was almost his back to route effort, like &#x27;Tomake Chai&#x27; and &#x27;Bose Anko&#x27;, which also contained 6 songs on each side. 5 Songs were played with an electric guitar, and 1 song with both electronic keyboard and guitar. Rest of all songs were played with electronic keyboard. This album was remarkable with four more points—1) Here his new name was used primarily, with his old name within brackets (unlike previous albums), 2) His then actual photo was used as cover photo, 3) It was his last album recorded in Saregama India Limited. 4) It was his last album which was published only as cassette. His next Bengali full solo album was published in 2005, after a long 3 years gap.

In 2003, he recorded an English song album &#x27;Reaching Out&#x27; which contained 10 songs. All songs were completely accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar. 2 songs were translation of two former Bengali songs, but the other 8 songs were directly written in English. This was Suman&#x27;s first solo album which was published from a recording label other than SAREGAMA India Limited. It was published from Cosmic Harmony, which continued to publish his next few albums. It was his first album, which was marketed with his new name Kabir Suman, which is continuing after that.

2004 saw a long-awaiting incident, when Kabir Suman and Anjan Datta recorded an album collaboratively. It was named &#x27;Onek Din Por&#x27;, which contained 10 songs, 5 each were written by each artist. Suman&#x27;s songs were accompanied by guitar and harmonica, where Anjan&#x27;s songs were accompanied by lead guitar, bass guitar and harmonica by other musicians. Anjan himself played acoustic guitar, and Suman accompanied him by harmonica in a song. This was a milestone in Bengali Music Industry where two singer-songwriters recorded an album jointly. The effort was mainly from Kabir Suman, as his 12th album. It was also his first album which was published as both cassette and CD, and his first album recorded digitally.

Kabir Suman returned to his solo Bengali album in 2005 after a three-year long gap. This time he published his 13th album &#x27;Dekhchhi Toke&#x27;. It contained only 8 songs, which was his first album with least contained song. This album was remarkable because, it was his first album where he not only recorded the entire music instrumental parts, but also mixed and finally mastered. It was the first Bengali album which contained songs that were written, composed, sung, instruments played, recorded, mixed and mastered by a single person. 4 songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, and 4 songs by electric guitar. However its recording quality was a bit unclear and hazy.

His next Bengali full solo album &#x27;Nandigram&#x27; was published in 2007, after a 2 years gap. It was his 14th album, and his 2nd concept album, and his first political album. Around this time, the political situation of West Bengal was in unrest regarding land acquisition at Singur and Nandigram. On 14 March 2007, many people were killed by police at Nandigram. At that time, Kabir Suman was a reporter of Tara TV. He went more than one time to those places, and arose high protest by both as reporter and singer-songwriter-musician. This album contained 8 songs, and one lyric. It was his second album which contained lyric reading, without any music and tune. The title song &#x27;Nandigram` was sung by him without any kind of instrumental, it was also his first time. All the rest of the songs were accompanied with only electronic keyboard. All songs&#x27; theme was the forceful land acquisition from then state government, and brutal massacre by them. It was his third album after a long gap since &#x27;Gan-ola`, published in 1994, in which the front cover does not have any picture of himself. The royalty of this album went completely to those ordinary persons of Singur and Nandigram, who were continuing protest against the land acquisition. His protest continued to the next year, when he published his 15th album and his 3rd concept album &#x27;Rijwanur Britto` in 2008. It was his first album which was published in Kolkata Book Fair, and the only album which was published personally, without any help from any recording company. It contained 8 songs, and except one song which was played with guitar, all other songs were played with electronic keyboard. All songs&#x27; theme was mysterious death of young multimedia designer Rizwanur Rahman, which was very controversial, and created some political unrest in West Bengal. It was his first album which was published only in CD. During this period Kabir Suman gaining popularity again in view of his many protest songs, so he obliged to publish another protest song album in the same year. His 16th album &#x27;Protirodh&#x27;, which was also a political album and his 4th concept album., which contained 8 songs. All songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, with some songs mixed with guitar a bit. Both of these albums published in 2008 did not have any photo of him on front cover. It is often called a sequel of &#x27;Nandigram&#x27;. Like &#x27;Nandigram&#x27;, all songs&#x27; theme was forceful land acquisition from then state government, and brutal massacre by them, and the royalty of this album went completely to those ordinary persons of Singur and Nandigram, Both &#x27;Nandigram&#x27; and &#x27;Protirodh&#x27; became very popular to the then opposition party of West Bengal All India Trinamool Congress. They played it on various meetings, distributed CD copies in very low price to voters. This album was marked by two aspects—1) It was his last album which was published as both cassette and CD, because from 2009, the cassette manufacturing was completely stopped in India. 2) It was his last album published from Cosmic Harmony. His protest-mindness helped Trinamool Congress to stand him as an MP in then coming Lok sabha election. He sang many such songs in his election campaign.

After elected as MP, he returned again to music recording in 2010. This time he published his 17th album &#x27;Chhatradharer Gaan&#x27;. and his 5th concept album, and his 4th political album. It contained only 8 songs, and all songs were accompanied by a simple guitar. No other instruments were used. It was his first Bengali album which he recorded entirely with guitar, without any other musicians. This album was remarkable because it was his first album after he became an MP. The main theme of this album was the forest area at western West Bengal, its people, their political situation, and some reasonless harassment from central government. During that time, Chhatradhar Mahato was arrested and imprisoned, joint paramilitary force was posted in that area, and they started harassing common people of forest area, saying that they are helping Maoists. For this sensitive reason, this album became controversial. Suman&#x27;s party All India Trinamool Congress did not like his view, and repeatedly said to ban this album, and stop saying about supporting Chhatradhar Mahato, but he did not change his view, so the clash continued with him from other leaders, including AITC supremo, then railway minister Mamata Banerjee. This album was recorded by following an early stereo recording concept, i.e.—vocal on one side, and guitar on another side.

In 2011, Suman published his 18th album &#x27;Lalmohoner Lash&#x27;. It was his 6th and last concept album, and his 5th and last political album. It contained 9 songs, and has a stark contrast with previous albums in view of instrumentation. Unlike &#x27;Chhatradharer Gaan&#x27;, which was completely accompanied by guitar, &#x27;Lalmohaner Lash&#x27; was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard. This album was recorded and released at that time, when due to his political view not supported by his party, the clash with his party was continuing. It is often called a sequel of &#x27;Chhatradharer Gan&#x27;. Like &#x27;Chhatradharer Gan&#x27;, all songs were in favor of revolution of forest people living in western West Bengal, and protest against harassment caused by the central paramilitary force, operation Green hunt etc. During that time, Lal Mohan Tudu was arrested applying UAPA, and killed by the paramilitary force. A very sharp ear can listen a humming sound in the end of some songs, it was due to 14 Kilohertz crosstalk signaling. It was caused by some earthing problem. This album also does not contain any photo of him on front cover.

2012 saw the till now last album, which is his 19th album &#x27;63te&#x27;. After some political and concept album since 2007, he returned to a standard album. It is his first standard album after &#x27;Dekhchhi Toke&#x27;, which was published in 2005. It includes 15 songs, which was after long time since 1996, when he published &#x27;Chaichhi Tomar Bondhuta&#x27;. Instrumentation was returned again to his old style, 4 or 5 songs were played by guitar, and all other songs were played by electronic keyboard. Due to his home recording like recent albums, some outside noise were unintentionally added with final recording. The humming problem with &#x27;Lalmohoner Lash&#x27; was also present here in some of the songs.

==== Basic song albums with his &#x27;own created-others sang&#x27; songs from 2002 ====
In 2002, Indranil Sen recorded an album &#x27;Tumi Gan Gaile&#x27;, which contained 8 songs. Sanjay Das arranged the instrumental music with some session musicians. Kabir Suman said a little speech in the middle of the title song. Complete lyrics were printed in album cover. It was his first collaborative album as &#x27;Kabir Suman&#x27;, and also his first collaborative album which was published as both cassette and CD.

In 2006, another album published named &#x27;13&#x27;, which contained 13 songs, where Suman sang with Sabina Yasmin. Some songs were sung by Suman, some by Sabina, and some as duet. Among these, one song was written and composed by Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah. The entire instrumentation was done by Suman. Some songs were accompanied with guitar and harmonica, other songs were by electronic keyboard, and some were mixed with both electronic keyboard and guitar. Complete lyrics were printed in album cover. It was his first collaborative album, which was recorded digitally and instrumentations were mixed by software sequencer like Reason, Samplitude, and Nuendorum. It was his last collaborative album which was published as both cassette and CD. One song was previously published in 1994.

In 2010, Sabina Yasmin recorded an album &#x27;Suprobhat Bishonnota&#x27;, which contained 10 songs. The entire instrumentation was done by Suman. Some songs were accompanied with guitar and harmonica, other songs were by electronic keyboard, and some was mixed with both electronic keyboard and guitar. It was his first and till now the only collaborative album, which was published only as CD. A very sharp ear can listen a humming sound in the end of some songs, it was due to 14 Kilohertz crosstalk signaling. In some songs, background noise was also born, and to depress it, over-noise-reduction happened in some tracks.

==== Motion picture soundtrack from 2009 ====
In 2009, Kabir Suman returned again to Bengali film industry as a music director after a long gap. In this year, he wrote, composed, sung, and instruments played in a Bengali film &#x27;Diet&#x27;, which contained 3 songs. Here Suman played his guitar, electronic keyboard and all instrumental sounds were mixed by him. Two songs were sung by Suman, one by Sabina Yasmin. Background score was also done by Suman. Unfortunately the motion picture became flop, and there was no release of its soundtrack album. The movie was released at the time when he was elected as MP.

2014 was the greatest year of Suman as a music director. In this year, he directed music in a Bengali film Jaatishwar, which contained 21 songs. It had the most songs in a single film in the history of Bengali film industry. Like his first film Mahasangram, this movie also had another person as the arranger, this time it was Indraadip Dasgupta. In only one song, Kabir Suman played his guitar (with other instruments by others). Beside Kabir Suman, other singers were Rupankar Bagchi, Shrikanta Acharya, Manomay Bhattacharya, Suman Mukhopadhyay, Kalika Prasad Bhattacharya, Kharaj Mukhopadhyay, Dibyendu Mukhopadhyay, Saptarshi Mukhopadhyay, Anupam Roy, Sidhu, Saki &amp; Shramana Chakraborty. It was the only Bengali movie so far—which had a Spanish song. Complete lyrics were printed in a booklet, included in this album. There was a way to use all songs as mobile phone caller tune. Both the movie and the soundtrack became a major hit, and Kabir Suman received the National Award for Best Music Direction. He also got Radio Mirchi Award for best lyricist, best compact disc, and best seller compact disc for this film.

==== Songs created by Rabindra Nath Tagore from 2002 ====
He recorded Tagore&#x27;s Song again in 2002, after a long gap. This year, he recorded &#x27;Kalo Horin Chokh&#x27; which had 10 songs, 2 songs were recorded previously in 1972 and 1994 respectively. It was the first Tagore&#x27;s song album, where all songs were accompanied by either guitar &amp; harmonica or electronic keyboard, which was played by solely Kabir Suman. An extended recording of this album as EP cassette &#x27;Sondhyadiper Shikha&#x27; was published in next year 2003, which was 4 more songs, 1 of them was published in &#x27;Kalo Horin Chokh&#x27;. It was his last Tagore Song album in both cassette and CD format. He recorded his next Tagore Song album &#x27;Ganer Resh&#x27; in 2016, which was completely without any instruments. It was published only as CD.

==== Other recordings ====
Beside those albums, he recorded some other songs, which were compiled on some albums like &#x27;Onurodher Asor&#x27;, &#x27;Nagorik Kobiyal&#x27;, &#x27;Pata Jhore Jay&#x27;, &#x27;Ei Prothom&#x27; (a live album with Nachiketa Chakraborty) etc. He also recorded two songs for a Bengali Movie &#x27;Bhoy&#x27; – which was recorded and released in 1996, and one song for a Bengali Movie &#x27;Yoddha&#x27; – which was recorded in 1995, but never released. Concord Trio has recorded two Suman&#x27;s songs in 1994 and one in 1997 respectively for their albums &#x27;Konthe Nilem Notun Gan&#x27; and &#x27;Tomar Safar&#x27;. Lopamudra Mitra has recorded two Suman&#x27;s songs in 1995 and one in 1996 respectively for her albums &#x27;Notun Ganer Nouko Bawa&#x27; and &#x27;Bhetor Ghore Brishti&#x27;. From 1997 to 2003 (except 2002), Sandhya Mukhopadhyay has recorded two Suman&#x27;s songs almost each year, those were published respectively in her albums &#x27;Dhonno Hok&#x27;, &#x27;Shesh Dorjata Perole&#x27;, &#x27;Aschhe Shotabdite&#x27;, &#x27;Rongdhonu Tana Setu&#x27;, &#x27;Sada Payra Giyechhe Ure&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Osshomedher Ghora Chhutechhe&#x27;, among them one song in 1999 won the best Bengali album award.

==== Digital songs ====
Since 2011, Kabir Suman started posting his new songs on his website. During this time his 19th album &#x27;63te&#x27; was released as compact disc format, which contained some songs that were also published on his website. After that, he started completely releasing his new songs (as mostly audio format, sometimes as video format) through his website. Sometimes he releases some songs also through SoundCloud. All his internet-only songs are only playable, but not downloadable. It does not cost any money for listening those songs. It is first such example for a Bengali musician to release songs only in internet. Beside his self-created songs, he also released some Indian Classical songs and some old songs, created by late Dilip Kumar Roy and others.

==== Present status ====
Although he has not recorded any studio album since 2012 (actually his last recording in a professional recording studio occurred in 2008, since when he has recorded his studio albums entirely at his home), he has recently recorded two soundtrack albums in 2014 and 2016. He is continuing live performance on various stages in Kolkata and various towns in West Bengal as of 2017. He also sometimes performs live in some cities outside West Bengal, including both Indian and foreign cities, even outside of Asia. He also teaches songs in his house on weekends. Despite not being completely physically fit due to some nerve problems, he still performs a three-hour solo live performance, playing electronic keyboard (now simply an acoustic piano). Until recently, he played the guitar. He also sometimes plays melodica and harmonica at his concerts. Since 2013, he took some additional musicians in his concerts for playing additional acoustic guitar and electronic percussion/tabla.

== Political activities ==
Suman was a journalist in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution and wrote &quot;Mukto Nicaragua&quot; (Liberated Nicaragua) on his experiences. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, he composed songs in protest against fundamentalism. He is also noted for his strong declamations against political opponents in public. Since 2006, when Suman was involved in the land struggle in Nandigram, he started aligning himself to Trinamool Congress. His songs on the Nandigram land issues have been released on two albums, &quot;Nandigram&quot; and &quot;Pratirodh&quot;. Suman participated in the Singur agitation &amp; other TMC party programmes on a regular basis.

The TMC nominated him for the 2009 general election from Jadavpur constituency in West Bengal, and won the election, defeating his nearest rival, Sujan Chakraborty of the CPI(M).

In November 2009, Suman had a dispute with the TMC. He complained that the local leaders of the party were not allowing him to work, and his views were not taken seriously in the party. However, the issue was resolved amicably in a series of closed door meetings.

Suman has also been vocal in his support for the movement of tribals in Lalgarh, and has composed an album called &quot;Chhatradharer Gaan&quot; in support of the mass movement, going against the wishes of the party. Going against the party position, he has also expressed his protests against &quot;Operation Green Hunt&quot;, the Indian Government&#x27;s military operation where the Naxalites have some influence.

Suman, at the end of March 2010, claimed that he is going to leave Trinamool Congress and also his membership of the Parliament. On the request of Mahasweta Devi he postponed his resignation for seven days. Within a few days, however, he made a U-turn and declared on 7 April that he does not want to resign, to prevent embarrassing the party further. Currently, he conveys his political opinions through his own website.

== Personal life ==
Suman was born in a Hindu Brahmin family. He converted to Islam in 1999 to mark his protest against the killing of Christian missionary Graham Staines by a former member of Bajrang Dal. Despite having converted to Islam, Suman describes himself as agnostic and nihilist-anarchist &quot;of an academic sort.&quot; When questioned about his religious beliefs in 2007, he replied: &quot;If there was a God, there wouldn&#x27;t be cruelty to animals and children.&quot;

Suman, whose birth name was Suman Chattopadhyay, changed his name to &quot;Kabir Suman&quot; post-conversion. According to him, &quot;I wanted to keep the name my parents gave me, so I kept Suman. I took the name Kabir after Sheikh Kabir, a Bengali Muslim poet who wrote &quot;Baishnab Padabali&quot;.&quot;

Suman married five times in his lifetime, but he says that he does not believe in the institution of marriage: &quot;Marriage is another form of bondage. I wish I hadn&#x27;t done it so many times.&quot; His present wife, since 2000, is Sabina Yasmin, a Bangladeshi singer. 
== Controversies ==
=== Allegations of domestic violence ===
One of Suman&#x27;s former wives was a German national. She reportedly accused Suman of domestic violence and filed a criminal complaint against Suman. According to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Indian Express&quot;, Suman&#x27;s &quot;messy divorce...and rumours of domestic violence didn&#x27;t go down well with the people.&quot;

=== Support for ban on book by Taslima Nasrin ===
Suman supported a ban by the Government of West Bengal on the book &quot;Dwikhandito,&quot; written by the Bangladeshi writer and activist Taslima Nasrin, for allegedly blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. The ban was later lifted by the Calcutta High Court. Nasrin, referring to a television appearance where Suman denounced her book, has stated: &quot;I did not fear the threats made against me by the Islamic radicals as much as the fatwa issued by Kabir Suman.&quot; Nasrin has alleged that she lived in fear following Suman&#x27;s remarks, and described Suman as &quot;communal&quot; and &quot;zealously Islamic&quot;, following his conversion to Islam. Academic Malvika Maheshwari has linked Suman&#x27;s initial candidature by the Trinamool Congress with his support for the ban on Nasrin&#x27;s book, as part of a &quot;policy of &#x27;Muslim appeasement&#x27;&quot; by the party.

=== Abusive language towards a journalist ===
In January 2022, Suman attacked in abusive language over the phone in a conversation with journalist Bittu Raychaudhuri from Republic TV, which was illegally recorded by the media house, without informing Suman. Suman&#x27;s conduct was widely criticised and led to a criminal complaint being filed against him for attacking Hindu sentiments and misogynistic vulgar statements about women in West Bengal.

<text>Clamart () is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris.

The town is divided into two parts, separated by a forest: &quot;bas Clamart&quot;, the historical centre, and &quot;petit Clamart&quot; with urbanization developed in the 1960s replacing pea fields. The canton of Clamart includes only a part of the commune. The other part of the commune belongs to the canton of Le Plessis-Robinson.

=== Les petits pois (peas) ===
The city name is famous in French gastronomy. A speciality with peas as a side-dish, is called &quot;à la Clamart&quot;. Close to Paris and its central marketplace (Les Halles), Clamart&#x27;s peas were the first of the season.

=== De Gaulle assassination attempt ===

On 22 August 1962 the French President Charles de Gaulle was the target of an assassination attempt organised by the French Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Bastien-Thiry. As de Gaulle&#x27;s black Citroën DS 19 sped through Petit-Clamart it was met by a barrage of submachine-gun fire. De Gaulle and his entourage, which included his wife, survived the attempt without any casualties or serious injuries while the attempt&#x27;s perpetrators were subsequently all arrested and put on trial. The leader of the assassination attempt, Jean Bastien-Thiry, was executed by firing squad after his 1963 conviction, and was the last person to be executed by firing squad in France.

<doc id="1169267" wikidata="Q262554" url="?curid=1169267" title="Margaret Spellings">
<text>Margaret M. LaMontagne Spellings (née Dudar; born November 30, 1957) is an American government and non-profit executive who serves as president and
CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center. She previously served as the eighth United States secretary of education from 2005 to 2009. After leaving the government, Spellings served as president of the University of North Carolina System, overseeing the seventeen campus system from 2016 to 2019. She then served as president and CEO of Texas 2036 from 2019 to 2023.

Spellings worked in several positions under George W. Bush during his tenure as Governor of Texas and President of the United States. She was one of the principal proponents of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act that aimed at reforming primary and secondary education. She served as education secretary for the entire second term of Bush&#x27;s administration, during which time she convened the Commission on the Future of Higher Education to recommend reform at the post-secondary level.

==Early life and education==
Margaret M. Dudar was born on November 30, 1957, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and moved with her family to Houston, Texas when she was in the third grade. She graduated from Sharpstown High School in 1975.

She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Houston in 1979 and worked in an education reform commission under Texas Governor William P. Clements and as associate executive director for the Texas Association of School Boards. Before her appointment to George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential administration, Spellings was the political director for Bush&#x27;s first gubernatorial campaign in 1994, and later became a senior advisor to Bush during his Texas governorship from 1995 to 2000.

==Secretary of Education==

Following Rod Paige&#x27;s departure as Secretary of Education, Spellings was nominated to that position by President George W. Bush on November 17, 2004, confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 20, 2005, which also marked the beginning of Bush&#x27;s second presidential term, and ceremonially sworn in on January 31 the same year. She was the second female Secretary of Education.

===&quot;Postcards from Buster&quot; controversy===

On January 21, 2005, one day after being confirmed as Secretary of Education, Spellings wrote a letter to the Public Broadcasting Service warning the network not to air an episode of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;. In that episode, the animated bunny Buster visits Vermont to learn about maple sugar production and meets real-life children who have lesbian parents. The children tell Buster they have a &quot;mom and stepmom.&quot; A child explains that one of the women is her stepmother whom she loves. No other comment is made about the family.

Spellings&#x27;s letter reminded Pat Mitchell, CEO of PBS, that &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot; was funded in part by the Department of Education and &quot;that many parents would not want their young children exposed to the life-styles portrayed in the episode.&quot; PBS decided not to distribute the episode, but WGBH, the public television station in Boston, said it would air it and offered it to any station &quot;willing to defy the Education Department.&quot;

Cusi Cram, a writer for &quot;Arthur&quot; (from which that program was spun-off), later wrote a play titled &quot;Dusty and the Big Bad World&quot;, based on the controversy.

In a 2022 statement about the show&#x27;s 25th and final season, Spellings told NPR that &quot;the world is very different today&quot; and that the government &quot;now reflects a greater openness to the multi-faceted, diverse stories that Americans can tell about themselves, their lives, and the country we share.&quot;

===No Child Left Behind===
In April 2005, on PBS&#x27;s &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;, she called Connecticut&#x27;s resistance to the No Child Left Behind Act the &quot;soft bigotry of low expectations&quot;. According to the program&#x27;s transcript, she said:


===Controversy overseeing student loan programs===
On May 10, 2007, Spellings testified before the House Education and Labor Committee responding to criticism from New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo that the Education Department had been &quot;asleep at the switch&quot; in overseeing student loan programs, allowing corruption and conflicts of interest to spread. Spellings has further gone on record to say that she is disregarding the suggestion by the Inspector General to hold the loan companies accountable for their graft.

Altha Cravey and Robert Siegel wrote in the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; that Spellings had been &quot;supporting for-profit colleges who prey on students – and then profiting off those same students when they default on their loans.&quot; Spellings served on the board of directors for the Apollo Group, the parent company of the for-profit University of Phoenix, which paid her more than $300,000.

===Commission on the Future of Higher Education===
In September 2005, Spellings announced the formation of the Secretary of Education&#x27;s Commission on the Future of Higher Education, which has also been referred to as the Spellings Commission. The commission was charged with recommending a national strategy for reforming post-secondary education, with a particular focus on how well colleges and universities were preparing students for the 21st-century workplace. Controversial recommendations included a call for colleges and universities to focus on training students for the workforce and supporting research with commercial applications.

It had a secondary focus on how well high schools were preparing students for post-secondary education. Spellings described the work of the commission as a natural extension into higher education of the reforms carried out under No Child Left Behind, and is quoted as saying: &quot;It&#x27;s time we turn this elephant around and upside down and take a look at it.&quot;

==Post-Government tenure==
After leaving her role as Secretary of Education, she founded Margaret Spellings &amp; Company, an education consulting firm in Washington, D.C. She was a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Spellings is currently co-chair of the Future of Tech Commission alongside Jim Steyer of Common Sense Media, an organization that focuses on technology and privacy policy.

===President of the University of North Carolina (UNC)===

On October 23, 2015, Spellings was elected as the president of the University of North Carolina system by the board of governors, effective March 1, 2016. She succeeded Thomas W. Ross, who was fired by the Board of Governors in a controversial move that some believed was motivated by politics. She is the second woman to serve as president of the University of North Carolina. In her role as president, she oversaw the seventeen constituent institutions that make up the UNC system, each having its own chancellor that serves as the chief executive on the local campus. Her base salary was $775,000.

==== Selection controversy ====
Spellings&#x27;s election as president of the university was controversial because of the way the secretive search process was conducted. At the Board of Governors meeting at which she was selected, several faculty attempted to read a statement before being escorted out by campus police. Over 100 faculty protestors outside the room shouted loud enough to be heard through the closed doors. According to the protestors, Spellings represented &quot;everything that is troubling in the direction of public higher education in this country.&quot; &quot;Faculty leaders said they were ignored during the process.&quot; Outgoing President Ross described the environment Spellings was entering as &quot;hostile&quot;. On her first day, March 1, 2016, students and faculty walked out of their classes on six campuses. In Chapel Hill, demonstrators gathered on the steps of Wilson Library.

Several board of governors members called on Board Chairman John Fennebresque to resign for what they viewed as a mishandled and secretive search process. Chairman Fennebresque resigned the next business day following Spellings&#x27;s election. System-wide faculty also offered up criticism of the process, declining to prejudge the new president, but saying that she would need to work hard to overcome the distrust built by the selection process. Controversy surrounding Spellings comes on the back of controversy surrounding the unexplained firing of her predecessor, which some have accused of being politically motivated, though this has been denied by Fennebresque.

====LGBT issues and Response to House Bill 2====
On October 23, 2015, Spellings was heavily criticized for making a comment about members of the LGBT community, suggesting it was a &quot;lifestyle.&quot; In addition, many UNC campuses, in early 2016, were plastered with leaflets by discontented students, decrying Spellings as a &quot;corporate educator&quot;, among other criticisms, such as her closeness to right-wing political figures.

On April 7, 2016, Spellings sent instructions to all elements of the University of North Carolina system to comply with the controversial new North Carolina law, the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act (HB2), which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of their birth sex. Spellings said the next day that her instructions to comply did not imply her endorsement of the law. Students around the state protested the law.

On May 4, the U.S. Department of Justice informed Spellings that the University of North Carolina system was in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 because of her previous declaration that she would enforce HB2. On May 31, the News &amp; Observer of Raleigh reported that Spellings reversed her position and said she would not enforce HB2 to avoid a possible loss in federal funding for North Carolina.

====Removal of Confederate Statue====
On August 20, 2018, anti-racist protesters toppled the Silent Sam statue at University of North Carolina. Ms. Spellings in a joint statement said that &quot;The actions last evening were unacceptable, dangerous, and incomprehensible.&quot; &quot;We are a nation of laws and mob rule and the intentional destruction of public property will not be tolerated.&quot;

====Resignation====
In October 2018, Spellings announced that she was resigning, effective March 1, 2019.

===Future of Tech Commission===
Spelling launched the Future of Tech Commission with Common Sense Media founder Jim Steyer and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in April 2021. As co-chairs, this commission will compile solutions for a comprehensive tech policy agenda under President Biden and Congress on topics as privacy, antitrust, digital dequity, and content moderation/platform accountability.

==In popular culture==
Spellings appeared on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; (episode airing November 21, 2006). She was the first sitting Cabinet member to appear as a contestant on the show. She came in second with a score of $11,100, losing to actor Michael McKean&#x27;s $38,800. She was the only active member of the Bush Administration to appear on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, as of her appearance on May 22, 2007. She also appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on July 22, 2008. She appeared over the phone on NPR&#x27;s News Quiz &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on March 8, 2008.

<text>Joseph Meyer (9 May 1796 - 27 June 1856) was a German industrialist and publisher, most noted for his encyclopaedia, Meyers Konversations-Lexikon.

==Biography==
Meyer was born at Gotha, Germany, and was educated as a merchant in Frankfurt am Main. He went to London in 1816, but returned to Germany in 1820 after business adventures and stock speculations fell through. Here he invested in enterprises such as the textile trade (1820–24). Soon after the first steam-hauled railway had started in December 1835, Meyer started to make business plans to start the first railways. He also bought some concessions for iron mining. In 1845 he founded the &quot;Deutsche Eisenbahnschienen-Compagnie auf Actien&quot; (German Railway Rail joint stock company).

Meyer operated very successfully as a publisher, employing a system of serial subscription to publications, which was new at that time. To this end he founded a company, Bibliographisches Institut, in Gotha in 1826. It published several editions of the Bible, works of classical literature (&quot;Miniatur-Bibliothek der deutschen Classiker&quot;, &quot;Groschen-Bibliothek&quot;), the world in pictures on steel engravings (&quot;Meyers Universum&quot;, 1833–61, 17 volumes in 12 languages with 80,000 subscribers all over Europe), and an encyclopaedia, (&quot;das Grosse Conversations-Lexikon für die gebildeten Stände&quot;; see Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1839–55, 52 volumes). His company grew substantially, and in 1828 he moved it from Gotha to Hildburghausen, where he died thirty years later. He became involved in cartography, producing many atlases with steel-engraved maps printed from steel plates, including &quot;Meyer&#x27;s Groẞer Hand-Atlas&quot; (1843-1860).

In 1830, inspired by new of the July Revolution in France, Meyer founded newspapers that promoted the liberal ideals of the revolutionaries. In 1848 he supported the revolutions that took place throughout Germany and much of Europe, and in 1849 was briefly imprisoned for his revolutionary activities. His publishing and other businesses prospered, and by 1910 his grandsons constituted the richest family in the Saxon territories, with more total wealth than the King of Saxony.

After Meyer&#x27;s death in 1856, his son Herrmann Julius Meyer took over the Bibliographisches Institut, which was at that time struggling financially.

<text>Fibromas are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme tissue. The term &quot;fibroblastic&quot; or &quot;fibromatous&quot; is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term &quot;fibroma&quot; is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.

== Types ==
=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g. in skin it is called dermatofibroma (fibroma simplex or nodulus cutaneous). A special form is the keloid, which derives from hyperplastic growth of scars.

=== Soft fibroma ===
The soft fibroma (fibroma molle) or fibroma with a shaft (acrochordon, skin tag, fibroma pendulans) consist of many loosely connected cells and less fibroid tissue. It mostly appears at the neck, armpits or groin. The photo shows a soft fibroma of the eyelid.

=== Other types of fibroma ===
The fibroma cavernosum or angiofibroma, consists of many often dilated vessels, it is a vasoactive tumor occurring almost exclusively in adolescent males.

The cystic fibroma (fibroma cysticum) has central softening or dilated lymphatic vessels.

The myxofibroma (fibroma myxomatodes) is produced by liquefaction of the underlying soft tissue.

The cemento-ossifying fibroma is hard and fibrous, most frequently seen in the jaw or mouth, sometimes in connection with a fracture or another type of injury.

Other fibromas: chondromyxoid fibroma, desmoplasmic fibroma, nonossifying fibroma, ossifying fibroma, nuchal fibroma, collagenous fibroma, fibroma of tendon sheath, perifollicular fibroma, pleomorphic fibroma, uterine fibroma, Gardner fibroma, etc.

The neurofibroma is a benign nerve-sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system.

=== Ovarian fibroma ===

It appears in the sex cord-stromal tumour group of ovarian neoplasms. Ovary fibromas are most frequent during middle age, and rare in children.
Upon gross pathological inspection, ovary fibromas are firm and white or tan.
Variants with edema are especially likely to be associated with Meigs&#x27; syndrome.
On microscopic examination, there are intersecting bundles of spindle cells producing collagen.

There may be thecomatous areas (fibrothecoma). The presence of an ovarian fibroma can cause ovarian torsion in some cases.

== Treatment ==
Benign fibromas may, but need not, be removed. Removal is usually a brief outpatient procedure or using cryotherapy in which the lesion is deep frozen (-196 degrees Celsius using liquid nitrogen) and thawed for two or more cycles, with full recovery within 3 to 4 weeks. The cryotherapy treatment needs no anesthetics and is painless. Another simple treatment is snip removal after injecting local anesthetic.

<doc id="1169288" wikidata="Q586009" url="?curid=1169288" title="Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour">
<text>Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour is a group of tumors composed of variable proportions of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and in the case of intermediate and poorly differentiated neoplasms, primitive gonadal stroma and sometimes heterologous elements.

Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour is a testosterone-secreting ovarian tumor and is a member of the sex cord-stromal tumour group of ovarian and testicular cancers. The tumour occurs in early adulthood (not seen in newborn), is rare, comprising less than 1% of testicular tumours. While the tumour can occur at any age, it occurs most often in young adults. Recent studies have shown that many cases of Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor of the ovary are caused by germline mutations in the &quot;DICER1&quot; gene. These hereditary cases tend to be younger, often have a multinodular thyroid goiter and there may be a personal or family history of other rare tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, Wilms tumor and cervical rhabdomyosarcoma.

Closely related terms include arrhenoblastoma and androblastoma. Both terms are classified under Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour in MeSH.

==Signs and symptoms==
Due to excess testosterone secreted by the tumour, one-third of adult females present with a recent history of progressive masculinization. Masculinization is preceded by anovulation, oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea and defeminization. Additional signs include acne and hirsutism, voice deepening, clitoromegaly, temporal hair recession, and an increase in musculature. Serum testosterone level is high.

==Cause==
The exact cause of Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour is not known.
Research studies seem to indicate that certain genetic mutations (in the &quot;DICER1&quot; gene) may play a role in many cases.

==Diagnosis==
Presence of an ovarian tumour plus hormonal disturbances suggests a Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour. However, hormonal disturbance is present in only two-thirds of cases. A conclusive diagnosis is made via histology, as part of a pathology report made during or after surgery. See also sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour.
===Classification===
The tumour is subdivided into many different subtypes. The most typical is composed of tubules lined by Sertoli cells and interstitial clusters of Leydig cells.

==Treatment==
The usual treatment is surgery. The surgery usually is a fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For malignant tumours, the surgery may be radical and usually is followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, sometimes by radiation therapy. In all cases, initial treatment is followed by surveillance. Because in many cases Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour does not produce elevated tumour markers, the focus of surveillance is on repeated physical examination and imaging. Given that many cases of Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor of the ovary are hereditary, referral to a clinical genetics service should be considered.

The prognosis is generally good as the tumour tends to grow slowly and usually is benign: 25% are malignant. For malignant tumours with undifferentiated histology, prognosis is poor.

<doc id="1169291" wikidata="Q612093" url="?curid=1169291" title="Granulosa cell tumour">
<text>Granulosa cell tumours are tumours that arise from granulosa cells. They are estrogen-secreting tumours and present as large, complex, ovarian masses. These tumours are part of the sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour or non-epithelial group of tumours. Although granulosa cells normally occur only in the ovary, granulosa cell tumours occur in both ovaries and testicles (see ovarian cancer and testicular cancer). These tumours should be considered malignant and treated in the same way as other malignant tumours of ovary. The ovarian disease has two forms, juvenile and adult, both characterized by indolent growth, and therefore has high recovery rates. The staging system for these tumours is the same as for epithelial tumours and most present as stage I. The peak age at which they occur is 50–55 years, but they may occur at any age.

Juvenile granulosa cell tumour is a similar but histologically distinct rare tumour. It too occurs in both the ovary and testis. In the testis it is extremely rare, and has not been reported to be malignant. Although this tumour usually occurs in children (hence its name), it has been reported in adults.

==Presentation==

Estrogens are produced by &quot;functioning&quot; tumours, and the clinical presentation depends on the patient&#x27;s age and sex.
* Female
** If the patient is postmenopausal, she usually presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, and in some cases hemoperitoneum.
** If the patient is of reproductive age, she would present with menometrorrhagia. However, in some cases she may stop ovulating altogether.
** If the patient has not undergone puberty, early onset of puberty may be seen.
** these tumours tend to have late recurrences (even after 30 years)

==Genetics==
===Adult granulosa cell tumours===

Using next generation DNA sequencing, 97% of adult granulosa cell tumours were found to contain an identical mutation in the FOXL2 gene . This is a somatic mutation, meaning it is not usually transmitted to descendants. Mutation c.402C&gt;G in the sequence of FOXL2 leads to the amino acid substitution p. C134W. It is believed that this mutation may be the cause of granulosa cell tumours.

===Juvenile granulosa cell tumours===
Two recent studies show that the enzyme AKT1 is involved in juvenile granulosa cell tumours. In-frame duplications in the pleckstrin-homology domain of the protein were found in more than 60% of juvenile granulosa cell tumours occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The tumours without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications displayed a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane, leading to a strong activation of AKT1. Analysis by RNA-Seq pinpointed a series of differentially expressed genes that are involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division-related processes. Further analyses pointed to a possible dedifferentiation process, and suggested that most of the transcriptomic dysregulations might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation. These results incriminate somatic mutations of AKT1 as probable driver events in the pathogenesis of juvenile granulosa cell tumours.

==Diagnosis==
===Gross appearance===
Tumours vary in size, from tiny spots to large masses, with an average of 10 cm in diameter. Tumours are oval and soft in consistency.
On cut-section, histology reveals reticular, trabecular areas with interstitial haemorrhage and Call–Exner bodies-small cyst like spaces interspersed within a Graafian follicle.

===Tumour marker===
Inhibin, a hormone, has been used as biomarker for granulosa cell tumours.

=== Histology ===

Juvenile granulosa cell tumors can be distinguished from adult granulosa cell tumors on histology by their abundant, eosinophilic cytoplasm; primitive, highly mitotic nuclei in polygonal cells; and disorganized follicles.

==In animals==
In the ovaries of aging squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), clusters of granulosa cells occur that resemble granulosa cell tumours in humans. These appear to be a normal change with age in this species.

<doc id="1169292" wikidata="Q5474322" url="?curid=1169292" title="Sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour">
<text>Sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour is a group of tumours derived from the stromal component of the ovary and testis, which comprises the granulosa, thecal cells and fibrocytes. In contrast, the epithelial cells originate from the outer epithelial lining surrounding the gonad while the germ cell tumors arise from the precursor cells of the gametes, hence the name germ cell. In humans, this group accounts for 8% of ovarian cancers and under 5% of testicular cancers. Their diagnosis is histological: only a biopsy of the tumour can make an exact diagnosis. They are often suspected of being malignant prior to operation, being solid ovarian tumours that tend to occur most commonly in post menopausal women.

This group of tumours is significantly less common than testicular germ cell tumours in men, and slightly less common than ovarian germ cell tumours in women (see Ovarian cancer).

==Types==


===Tumour types in order of prevalence===

*Granulosa cell tumour. This tumour produces granulosa cells, which normally are found in the ovary. It is malignant in 20% of women diagnosed with it. It tends to present in women in the 50-55yo age group with post menopausal vaginal bleeding. Uncommonly, a similar but possibly distinct tumour, juvenile granulosa cell tumour, presents in pre-pubertal girls with precocious puberty. In both groups, the vaginal bleeding is due to oestrogen secreted by the tumour. In older women, treatment is total abdominal hysterectomy and removal of both ovaries. In young girls, fertility sparing treatment is the mainstay for non-metastatic disease.
* Sertoli cell tumour. This tumour produces Sertoli cells, which normally are found in the testicle. This tumour occurs in both men and women.
*Thecoma. This tumour produces theca of follicle, a tissue normally found in the ovarian follicle. The tumour is almost exclusively benign and unilateral. It typically secretes estrogen, and as a result women with this tumour often present with postmenopausal bleeding.
*Leydig cell tumour. This tumour produces Leydig cells, which normally are found in the testicle and tend to secrete androgens.
*Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour. This tumour produces both Sertoli and Leydig cells. Although both cell types normally occur in the testicle, this tumour can occur in the ovary.
*Gynandroblastoma. A very rare tumour producing both ovarian (granulosa and/or theca) and testicular (Sertoli and/or Leydig) cells or tissues. Typically it consists of adult-type granulosa cells and Sertoli cells, but it has been reported with juvenile-type granulosa cells. It has been reported to occur in the ovary usually, rarely in the testis. Due to its rarity, the malignant potential of this tumour is unclear; there is one case report of late metastasis.
*Sex cord tumour with annular tubules, abbreviated SCTAT. These are rare tumours that may be sporadic or associated with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Definitive diagnosis of these tumours is based on the histology of tissue obtained in a biopsy or surgical resection. In a retrospective study of 72 cases in children and adolescents, the histology was important to prognosis.

A number of molecules have been proposed as markers for this group of tumours. CD56 may be useful for distinguishing sex cord–stromal tumours from some other types of tumours, although it does not distinguish them from neuroendocrine tumours. Calretinin has also been suggested as a marker. For diagnosis of granulosa cell tumour, inhibin is under investigation. Granulosa cell tumours and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours have specific genetic mutations that are characteristic and can help support the diagnosis.

On magnetic resonance imaging, a fibroma may produce one of several imaging features that might be used in the future to identify this rare tumour prior to surgery.

==Prognosis==
A retrospective study of 83 women with sex cord–stromal tumours (73 with granulosa cell tumour and 10 with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour), all diagnosed between 1975 and 2003, reported that survival was higher with age under 50, smaller tumour size, and absence of residual disease. The study found no effect of chemotherapy. A retrospective study of 67 children and adolescents reported some benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

==Research==
A prospective study of ovarian sex cord–stromal tumours in children and adolescents began enrolling participants in 2005. The International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry is studying these rare tumours and collecting data on them to further research. Targeted treatments are being evaluated for these tumours as well.

<text>Center Stage (), also known as Actress and Yuen Ling-yuk, is a 1991 Hong Kong biographical drama film directed by Stanley Kwan. It follows the life and career of silent film actress Ruan Lingyu (1910–1935), portrayed by Maggie Cheung.

Cheung won Best Actress award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1992 for performance.

==Plot summary==
The film is based on a true story: the tragic life of China&#x27;s first prima donna of the silver screen, Ruan Lingyu. This movie chronicles her rise to fame as a movie actress in Shanghai during the 1930s. Nicknamed the &quot;Chinese Garbo,&quot; Ruan Lingyu began her acting career when she was 16 and committed suicide at 24.

The film alternates between present scenes (production talks between director Kwan, Cheung, and co-star Carina Lau, interviews of witnesses who knew Ruan), re-creation scenes with Cheung (as Ruan, acting inside this movie), and extracts from Ruan&#x27;s original films including her final two films &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1934) and &quot;New Women&quot; (1935).

==Cast==

*Maggie Cheung as Ruan Lingyu
*Chin Han as Tang Jishan
*Lawrence Ng as Zhang Damin
*Tony Leung Ka-fai as Cai Chusheng
*Carina Lau as Li Lili
*Cecilia Yip as Lim Cho Cho

Two actors are the sons of their characters: Sun Dongguang is the son of director Sun Yu, and Zheng Dali is the son of actor Zheng Junli.

==Music==
The theme song &quot;Zangxin&quot; (; &quot;Burying the Heart&quot;) was composed by Taiwanese singer-songwriter Johnny Chen and recorded by Taiwanese singer Tracy Huang. It won Best Original Film Song at the 12th Hong Kong Film Awards.

The film also contains a scene in which Lianhua Film Company actors sang the &quot;Dalu Ge&quot; (; &quot;The Big Road Song&quot;) composed by Nie Er, which would become the theme song for Sun Yu&#x27;s 1934 anti-Japanese film &quot;The Big Road&quot;.

<doc id="1169299" wikidata="Q1931232" url="?curid=1169299" title="Pororoca">
<text>The Pororoca (, ) is a tidal bore, with waves up to high that travel as much as inland upstream on the Amazon River and adjacent rivers. Its name might come from the indigenous Tupi language, where it could translate into &quot;great roar&quot;. It could be also a Portuguese version of the term &quot;poroc-poroc&quot;, which in an indigenous&#x27; language was a way of expressing the act of destroying everything. It could be also a &quot;portmanteau&quot; of the words &quot;poroc&quot; (to take out, to tear away) and &quot;oca&quot; (house). It occurs at the mouth of the river where its waters meet the Atlantic Ocean.

==Explanation==

During new and full moons, when the ocean tide is highest, water flows in from the Atlantic, rather than the other way around. The Amazon&#x27;s flow reverses, the distance of which depends largely on the rainwater-generated outflow of the Amazon, and a water bulge speeds upstream often with great force, forming a tidal bore with an audible noise. The tidal phenomenon is best observed on biannual equinoxes in September and March during a spring tide. On an equinoctial spring tide, the Moon and Sun fall into direct alignment with the Earth, and their gravitational pull is combined, bringing the Pororoca and others around the world to their peak.

== Surfing ==
The wave has become popular with surfers. Since 1999, an annual championship has been held in São Domingos do Capim (on the adjacent Guamá River). However, surfing the Pororoca is especially dangerous, as the water contains a significant amount of debris from the shores of the river (often entire trees), in addition to dangerous fauna. In 2003 the Brazilian Picuruta Salazar won the event with a record ride of 12.5 km (7.8 mi) lasting 37 minutes.

<text>Okinawa Rendezvous () is a 2000 Hong Kong romantic comedy film produced and directed by Gordon Chan, and starring Leslie Cheung, Faye Wong, Tony Leung Ka-fai and Gigi Lai.

While not one of Hong Kong&#x27;s more significant films of the year, it was claimed by its director that it was filmed in less than 2 months without a script. It was shot entirely in the southern Japanese island of Okinawa and the film features many beautiful views of the island.

Its theme song was sung by Leslie Cheung entitled &quot;Without Love&quot; (没有爱) and is also found in his 2000 album, &quot;Big Heat&quot; (大热). Also, there were a few possible sub-themes like Faye Wong&#x27;s &quot;New Tenant&quot; (新房客) which is as well available in her 2000 album, &quot;Fable&quot; (寓言).

==Plot==
Jimmy Tong (Leslie Cheung) is an expert blackmailer and thief who specialises in white-collar crimes. With his side-kick (Vincent Kok), Jimmy steals a personal diary belonging to a yakuza leader, Ken Sato (Masaya Kato), intending to use its details as a platform for blackmailing and to extort money. Sato agreed to the uneasy deal and made preparations to pay Jimmy his exorbitant demands only for Sato&#x27;s girlfriend, Jenny (Faye Wong) to betray him and make off with the money to Okinawa.

Elsewhere, Dat Lo (Tony Leung) was vacationing with his girlfriend (Gigi Lai) and another jilted girl (Stephanie Che) in Okinawa (intending to use the vacation to dump his own girlfriend), but stumbles into Jimmy whom he had little problems recognising as an international crook. From here onwards, Dat set aside his irrelevant plans to dump his companions and sought to devise a plan to entrap and to subsequently arrest Jimmy. Dat tried to convince Jimmy as an accomplice to a new bank heist of which Jimmy needed little persuasion. However, Jenny comes into the frame and before long, both Jimmy and Dat fell in love with her.

<text>The Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is divided into 11 census divisions, which are numbered 1 to 11.

Unlike in some other provinces, census divisions do not reflect the organization of local government in Newfoundland and Labrador. The areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation and have no government of their own, as the province has no level of government between the provincial and municipal level.

==List of census divisions==

*Division No. 4, Newfoundland and Labrador (St. George&#x27;s-Stephenville)
*Division No. 5, Newfoundland and Labrador (Humber District-Corner Brook)
*Division No. 6, Newfoundland and Labrador (Central Newfoundland-Grand Falls-Windsor)
*Division No. 7, Newfoundland and Labrador (Bonavista/Trinity-Clarenville)
*Division No. 8, Newfoundland and Labrador (Notre Dame Bay-Lewisporte)
*Division No. 9, Newfoundland and Labrador (Northern Peninsula-St. Anthony)
*Division No. 10, Newfoundland and Labrador (Labrador-Happy Valley-Goose Bay)

<doc id="1169309" wikidata="Q2190609" url="?curid=1169309" title="Pedro Miguel">
<text>Pedro Miguel is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the northeastern part of the municipality of Horta on the island of Faial in the Azores. Pedro Miguel is located 6 km north of the city of Horta on the main regional road that encircles the island. The population in 2011 was 759, in an area of 14.48 km2.

==History==

The first record of the parish, which was named for one of the original inhabitants, dated August 7, 1590, came from a financial transaction between King Sebastian who sent the vicar 25 thousand reis (ostensibly for construction or furnishing of their church).

Pedro Miguel became a parish in 1666. In order to protect itself from surprise attacks by pirates that roamed the Canal, a small fort Forte Baixo was constructed in the 17th century.

In 1871, both a boys&#x27; and a girls&#x27; school operated from Pedro Miguel, since the community was part of a greater district that included Ribeirinha and Praia do Almoxarife. A justice of the peace operated from this district, where the electoral assembly was also situated. The population had reached 1,757 inhabitants by this time.

During the 1998 earthquake, which hit affected the northern communities of the island, several houses were damaged and the parochial church was irreparably damaged.

==Geography==

The parish of Pedro Miguel is situated in an area between &quot;Lomba dos Frades&quot; and &quot;Lomba Grande&quot;, and is bisected by the &quot;Ribeira de Pedro Miguel&quot;. It contains the localities Abegoaria, Arrochela, Atras da Ladeira, Caminho Redondo, Grota Funda, Rua da Igreja and Rua Velha.

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
Grota Funda is a cave located in a large volcanic crater located west of the parish centre, and which founded fragments of vegetable coals.

==Economy==
The communities economy revolved around mainly cereals and agricultural, as well as many orange orchards located closer to the center. The dairy industry was also an important contributor, and the Pedro Miguel was a major producer of local exports (most importantly butter).

==Culture==
Founded on 23 June 1977, the &quot;Grupo Folclórico e Etnográfico de Pedro Miguel&quot; () was established to perpetuate some of the traditions of the community, including folklore, song, dance and ethnographic representations. Using stylized period costumes, dating to late 19th and early 20th century, the group has travelled throughout the island and archipelago to present their brand of traditional culture. The large group (in 2011 about 41 members) of varying ages (13 to 60 years) promoted their first recorded CD in 2011, entitled &quot;Ao Toque da Viola&quot;.

<text>The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) is an administrative agency of the U.S. state of Illinois charged with building, operating, and maintaining toll roads in the state. The roads, as well as the authority itself, are sometimes referred to as the Illinois Tollway. The system opened in 1958 in the Chicago area, and has subsequently expanded to include the eastern and central sections of Interstate 88 (I-88) extending into the northwestern part of the state. Beginning in 2005, the system was reconstructed to include more lanes and open road tolling, the latter of which uses I-Pass transponders to collect revenue as vehicles pass antennas at toll plazas or designated entrance or exit ramps. , ISTHA maintains and operates of tollways in 12 counties in Northern Illinois.

==History==
The original Toll Highway Authority was established in 1941. After construction of the first toll highways in Illinois was delayed by World War II, the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission was established in 1953. The first three toll highways in the Chicago area were all planned, constructed, and opened in 1958 under the authority of this Commission. These first three toll highways are the present day Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-90/I-39/US 51), the Tri-State Tollway (I-94/I-294) and the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway (I-88, between Hillside and Sugar Grove). The first segment to open was the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway between Devon Avenue and Elgin on August 20, 1958 at 3 p.m. The Toll Highway Act, in its present form, dates from 1967, but has been amended since. Under this Act, promulgated April 1, 1968, ISTHA assumed the assets and obligations of the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission.

In the 1970s, the East–West Tollway was extended west from Sugar Grove to Dixon with a freeway continuing to the Quad Cities. The route was later given the I-88 designation in order to obtain a higher speed limit. In 2004, ISTHA voted to rename this route the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway.

In June 1984, Republican minority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives, James &quot;Pate&quot; Philip, helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the North–South Tollway, then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway. Officials at the Morton Arboretum, one of the nation&#x27;s premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway. They also promised to prevent the tollway authority from obtaining environmental approval from federal officials. Ultimately, the lawsuit was settled, and I-355 was opened in 1989 as a tollway between Army Trail Road and I-55 near Bolingbrook. On November 24, 2007, a extension of I-355 opened to link I-55 to I-80. Construction of that I-355 extension began after years of delays and environmental litigation.

The Illinois Tollway website officially launched on September 1, 1997. The website includes online ordering of I-Pass transponders and managing I-Pass accounts. In 2009–2010, the website underwent a $4.4 million e-commerce overhaul.

In 2004, ISTHA made a strategic decision to expand the tollway system instead of converting the roads to freeways. It adopted a $6.3 billion Congestion Relief Program. Under the program, the main toll plazas were rebuilt to have open road tolling, so that drivers with transponders would drive at normal speeds under toll collecting equipment instead of stopping to pay tolls. The toll plazas were relocated to the side of the road to handle vehicles without transponders. The plan also included rebuilding and widening many of the toll roads, including most of the original portion of I-88 and the northern and southern sections of I-294. I-355 was extended south of I-55 to connect to I-80 in New Lenox, a distance of , in order to serve fast-growing areas of Will County. The project also includes adding an interchange between the Tri-State Tollway and I-57. These projects were financed by long-term revenue bonds that require the system to remain as toll roads until the bonds are repaid in 2034.

The Congestion Relief Program was followed by another 15 year capital program named Move Illinois. Approved by ISTHA in 2011, the $14 billion capital program will address the remaining perceived needs of tollway system not addressed by the Congestion Relief Program, as well as construct several new projects. The program is expected to create 120,000 jobs and add $21 billion to the economy. The projects in Move Illinois include reconstructing and widening I-90 between Rockford and the Kennedy Expressway as well as I-294 between Balmoral Ave and 95th Street; new projects include constructing the Elgin-O&#x27;Hare Western Access project as well as an interchange between I-294 and I-57 (previously, the Interstates crossed, but had no direct connection).

Legislation passed in 2013 gives the authority the power to build high-speed rail lines if there is funding made available, similar to the authority of other state high-speed rail authorities. It is the only road-related authority with rail construction powers in the United States.

==Structure==
The Tollway&#x27;s board of directors has eleven members. The Governor of Illinois and the head of the Illinois Department of Transportation serve as ex officio members of the Tollway Board. The remaining 9 members are named by the governor. No more than 5 appointed members may be of the same political party as the governor. The Authority has the power to collect and raise tolls, and is responsible for the maintenance and construction of tollway roads and related signage (including electronic message boards, used for driving time notices, Amber Alerts and other notifications). The Tollway also supervises and manages the four (previously seven) Illinois Tollway oases. The close relationship between the governor and the near-majority of appointed board members has led to numerous allegations of endemic corruption throughout the tollway authority&#x27;s lifetime.

ISTHA&#x27;s annual budget for fiscal year 2010 totals $696 million. ISTHA has 1,704 full-time employees, of which 754 are toll collectors. As of July 11, 2019, ISTHA has $6,248,860,000 in bond debt, maturing as late as 2044, which have been rated Aa3, AA− and AA− by Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, respectively. On May 31, 2019, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded ISTHA&#x27;s bond rating from Aa3 to A1, with a stable outlook. ISTHA has the power to take lands by eminent domain, and ISTHA&#x27;s employees are subject to conflict of interest laws enacted in 2005.

The Executive Director of ISTHA supervises 12 departments.

The Tollway is patrolled by both police and non-police fleets. The Tollway comprises a separate Illinois State Police District 15, one of 21 districts of the Illinois State Police. ISTHA also operates a fleet of Highway Emergency Lane Patrol vehicles which assist stranded motorists with mechanical problems, flat tires or insufficient fuel. Each year, the H.E.L.P. Trucks assist more than 35,000 motorists and log nearly 1.5 million patrol miles.

===Toll roads===

, ISTHA maintains and operates of tollways in 12 counties in northern Illinois, comprising five routes:

* Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-39/I-90/US 51)
* Veterans Memorial Tollway (I-355)
* Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway/Chicago–Kansas City Expressway (I-88/IL 56/IL 110)
* Tri-State Tollway (I-80/I-94/I-294)
* Elgin-O&#x27;Hare Tollway (IL 390)

Except for the vicinity of O&#x27;Hare International Airport, none enter the city of Chicago. The Chicago Skyway, which is owned by the City of Chicago but on a 99-year lease to the Skyway Concession Company, is the only toll road in Illinois that is not operated by ISTHA.

ISTHA was planned to operate tolling for the Longmeadow Parkway bridge that is maintained by Kane County, Illinois, however in January of 2024, it was announced the bridge would be toll free.

===Toll collection===
ISTHA sets its tolls at a level necessary to maintain and operate the system while retiring its bond debt, and it is required to conduct public hearings on any proposed toll increase. In 1958, the tolls were set at 25 cents at the main plazas and 10 cents at the exit ramps. In 1983, the tolls increased to 40 cents at the main plazas and 15 cents at most ramps. With the advent of the I-Pass system in 2005, the tolls for cash payments were doubled, while rates for cars equipped with I-Pass transponders remained the same. On January 1, 2012, tolls increased by 87 percent, to 75 cents at the main plazas for transponder-equipped cars, and $1.50 for those paying cash. In addition, congestion pricing is used to charge trucks a rate which is $0.50 or $1.00 higher during rush hour than during off-peak hours.

Until the mid-1970s, the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (then the Northwest Tollway) used a ticket system on the segment between Elgin and Beloit to collect tolls based upon the exact mileage traveled. Drivers were handed a Hollerith card when they entered the segment and paid a toll when they left.

I-Pass is the Illinois Tollway’s electronic transponder toll collection system that allows drivers to pre-pay their tolls. , Tollway drivers use 3.3 million I-Pass transponders. Every toll lane on the system is equipped to accept I-Pass which can also be used on the Chicago Skyway and anywhere E-ZPass is accepted. (E-ZPass is a transponder consortium of toll road authorities on the East Coast.) A refundable deposit of $10 and $20 in pre-paid tolls is charged at the time of purchase. Illinois Tollway offers an auto-pay replenishment option by registering a credit or debit card to an I-Pass account at the time of activation. Each month, the minimum balance and replenishment amounts are recalculated based on the average usage during the previous six months. A special program for low-income motorists allows them to obtain I-Pass units with a reduced outlay of $20. Users choosing to replenish their account without auto-pay are responsible for monitoring their transactions and balance and must pay a $20 refundable deposit. There are various options for self-pay replenishment, including the Tollway Service Centers located at five oasis rest stops. Customers wishing to pay by check or cash can pay at the oasis customer service centers or can buy $20 I-Pass Gift Cards at Jewel-Osco.

ISTHA has implemented open road tolling, allowing any vehicle with an I-Pass or E-ZPass transponder to continue through the toll plaza at highway speeds while those paying cash have to stop at a tollbooth. If a vehicle registered with I-Pass passes through a toll collection without the transponder, the toll amount will be automatically deducted from the respective I-Pass account. This process is called &quot;V-Tolls&quot; (Video Tolls).

On February 25, 2021, ISTHA announced that cash tolling would be fully eliminated throughout the system, making permanent a moratorium on cash toll collection in place since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower-income motorists will be able to acquire an initial deposit-free I-Pass based on income requirements, and ISTHA had already instituted an online pay option for video tolling and pay-by-plate customers without I-Pass or EZPass transponders in June 2020 as a response to the pandemic. Plans regarding demolition of the side cash lanes along the tollways (which outside one I-Pass lane now designated to allow users to check their account status by an indicator lamp, are blocked off) are yet to be determined.

==Criticism==
ISTHA and the toll highway system in Illinois have undergone much criticism since the 1980s. Construction of the North–South Tollway (I-355) was delayed, in part, due to a dispute with the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. Original plans for this toll highway would have seen it constructed through the middle of land belonging to the Arboretum, and closer to the existing Illinois Route 53. Construction on other projects has also been delayed, mostly through protests by area residents.

Much of the criticism in the 1980s and 1990s was centered on the continued existence of ISTHA itself, and its quasi-independent status from even the Illinois General Assembly. The original decision to build the tollway was made in an era when five states used toll roads to create a superhighway between New York and Chicago. This predated the Interstate Highway System and the associated funding from federal gasoline taxes. Critics argue that Tollway users are paying twice, first by paying tolls and then by paying the same gasoline taxes that other motorists pay. Citizens&#x27; groups formed in the 1990s to try to force ISTHA to disband, and convert the toll highways in Illinois into freeways. This stems from the 1953 law that established the then Illinois State Toll Highway Commission. By 1999, Governor George Ryan began to publicly discuss the closure of ISTHA and the abolition of toll collection in Illinois, but the plans were eclipsed by Ryan&#x27;s increasing scandals. After Ryan declined to run for re-election and his successor, Governor Rod Blagojevich, had been elected (but had not yet taken office), the ISTHA board publicly suggested a sudden hike in toll rates that the new Governor could simply blame on his outgoing predecessor. The previous adjustment to Illinois toll rates had taken place in 1983. ISTHA would have been able to raise rates without approval of the Illinois General Assembly because of its quasi-independent nature. However, a rate hike did not go into effect at that time. Ultimately, the toll rates for I-Pass users remained at 1983 prices while the toll rate for cash payers doubled. Practically, the I-Pass system and open road tolling appears to have removed the annoying aspect of toll collection which motivated many toll opponents, and subsequently the calls to ending the tolls have quieted.

The Sierra Club criticized the capital projects as adding to urban sprawl while hurting air quality. In response, the expense of implementing Open Road Tolling has justified by claiming it significantly decreases the amount of pollution from vehicle exhaust that enters the air. This is because the old barrier style tollbooths adds to the amount of time that certain vehicles spend on the roadway by requiring them to slow down, stop, and sometimes idle for several minutes while waiting to pay their tolls. The introduction of the I-Pass system has greatly alleviated this problem since all vehicles with an I-Pass or E-Zpass can continue to travel at normal highway speeds through the toll plazas.

In 2003, during Governor George Ryan&#x27;s administration, ISTHA entered into a public-private partnership with Wilton Partners to renovate the oasis rest stops in exchange for a 25-year lease. That lease has been the subject of various investigations, including the political connections between food vendors in the oases with former Governor Blagojevich. Ultimately, Wilton Partners&#x27; lender foreclosed on the Oases.

On December 9, 2008, Governor Blagojevich was arrested on corruption charges including allegations that he solicited campaign donations from Tollway construction contractors. On December 18, Dalley resigned claiming that Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan would not grant waivers from the state ethics law that prohibited high level ISTHA executives from being employed by contractors within a year of leaving office. In January 2009, Governor Blagojevich was impeached, tried, and removed from office for abuse of power, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn. Following this, ISTHA Board appointed a new chief executive without consulting Quinn. On August 12, 2009, John Mitola, who was appointed the ISTHA board chairman in 2003 by Governor Blagojevich, resigned for personal reasons. The next day, Governor Quinn appointed a new chairman and two new board members. Ex-ISTHA Chairman Mitola was reported to have failed to disclose an investment in a real estate development with former state purchasing and contracting CEO Michael Rumman under ousted Governor Blagojevich. In addition, a number of top ISTHA staff members have left in 2009.

<doc id="1169321" wikidata="Q1843755" url="?curid=1169321" title="Feteira (Horta)">
<text>Feteira is a civil parish in the southern part of the municipality of Horta, on the island of Faial in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,899, in an area of 14.46 km2. It occupies the southern foothills of the Caldeira Volcano, along the coast. The name &quot;Feteira&quot; is derived from the Portuguese word for &quot;fern&quot;, and indicates a &quot;location of [many] ferns&quot;; the name likely refers to the original colonists&#x27; discovery of this area covered with ferns.

==History==
The early inhabitants colonized the area around Ribeira da Granja, along the coast near Lajinha and Ponta Furada. They built their first community along the coast, although on higher ground.

The Church of Feteira, consecrated in honor of the Holy Spirit, is one of the older churches on the island. Lost to history, its date of construction is currently unknown, although the first references to the sanctuary refer to 1562. In that Year, the local residents were forced to pay higher taxes to the parish. On June 30, 1568, King D. Sebastião passed a provision in favor of People of Feteira who sought the Crown&#x27;s intervention. Relating to its church, the historian Gaspar Frutuoso mentioned that it had three naves, supported by five columns, with arterial chapels on either side. It was a temple of good proportions (35 m in width) with a single bell-tower. The parish also had a nearby 15th century chapel dedicated to Saint Peter. In 1597, it was sacked and burned by English pirates. The chapel was a place of pilgrimage and popular religious festivities. Due to lack of attention and care, over time it was abandoned. 
Because of a history of piracy, there were small forts along the rugged coastline for the protection of the residents. They were part of an overall system of defenses around the island of Fayal, which suffered most of the time from lack of sufficient manpower and artillery. These fortified outposts decayed with time and the erosive action of the sea and tempests. Today, the ruins of these defensive positions have disappeared.

Following economic and social hardship in 1862, and weakness of political leaders to satisfy their demands, an uprising occurred in 1862 in several of the island&#x27;s towns over the imposition of new taxes. The people of Feteirs adhered to the protests.

==Geography==
It is located west of the center of the city of Horta, connected by the southern extension of the regional E.R.1-1ª roadway and a northern municipal road in the interior. Farmlands dominate the coastal plain between the neighbouring parishes of Angústias and Castelo Branco, while the coast is a rocky area formed by rugged lava stones and cliffs undercut by the Atlantic Ocean. The highest point in the parish is the peak of Cangueiro, approximately above sea level, below the crater rim of Cabeço Gordo. The coastal cliffs, which mark the southern border of the town, are at most above sea level. Lava flows formed intricate geomorphological structures, highlighted by the area of Lajinha (on the eastern border). Wave motion and currents have carved this region forming coastal arches, and undercutting the E.R. 1-1ª at points near the &quot;Rua da Além&quot;.

Intermittent creeks and small seasonal streams bisect the parish., supporting the growth of various settlements and neighbourhoods, involved inagriculture, including (from west to east): &quot;Ribeira do Granjo&quot;, &quot;Ribeira do São Pedro&quot; and &quot;Ribeira de Fonte do Rego&quot;. Five bridges cross these water courses at São Pedro, Porceirão, Igreja, a second one in São Pedro (at the lower part of the parish) and Ponte Nova.

Bisected by these natural barriers, the parish developed in various nuclei associated with the roads and pathways that interconnected the pasturelands and woodlots along the flanks of the Cabeço Gordo volcano. Consequently, small neighbourhoods or communities developed along: the regional roadway (that included Feteira de Baixo, Caminho do Meio and Alto da Lajinha), another route that connected Feteira to Flamengos (that included Cruz da Portela, Caminho das Terças and Lameiro Grande), a second lateral road that included Farrobim do Sul and intersected the interior towards Flamengos (that included Cimo de São Pedro, Atalaia, Grotas, Fonte do Rego and Cimo do Granjo), and a roadway that bisected these arterials starting in Angústias (from Courelas, across Cruz da Portela, to Portela and Grotas, to Fonte do Rego).

==Economy==
Agriculture is the primary source of income. Historically, the parish has cultivated potatoes, supported orange and lemon orchards, as well as large quantities of wheat and corn. Documents for 1886 indicate a cultivation of of potatoes. Most of these crops were cultivated for export, although small itinerant banana fields were cultivated for local consumption. These continue to important crops, but currently, the cattle and dairy industry is generally accepted as the primary source of agro-business (although some lambs are raised).

The fishery and paper industries have also supported the local economy. Yet, economic difficulties, in particular regional politics, have seen a decrease in people participating in these activities, since 1862.

There are approximately 37 &quot;impérios&quot; or religious structures to honour the Holy Spirit on the island, of these seven are located in the civil parish. Some, like the &quot;Império das Grotas&quot; in Feteira, date back to the 19th century (1898 specifically), have been susceptible to a change in the islands demographics, economics and agnosticism, and slowly abandoned due to local disinterest.

==Culture==
In addition to the feast days associated with the Holy Spirit, there are other religious and secular events that mark the annual calendar, including the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes (), which is held on the last weekend of August.

<doc id="1169322" wikidata="Q1269251" url="?curid=1169322" title="Dysgerminoma">
<text>A dysgerminoma is a type of germ cell tumor; it usually is malignant and usually occurs in the ovary.

A tumor of the identical histology but not occurring in the ovary may be described by an alternate name: seminoma in the testis or germinoma in the central nervous system or other parts of the body.

Dysgerminoma accounts for less than 1% of ovarian tumors overall. Dysgerminoma usually occurs in adolescence and early adult life; about 5% occur in pre-pubertal children. Dysgerminoma is extremely rare after age 50. Dysgerminoma occurs in both ovaries in 10% of patients and, in a further 10%, there is microscopic tumor in the other ovary.

Abnormal gonads (due to gonadal dysgenesis and androgen insensitivity syndrome) have a high risk of developing a dysgerminoma. Most dysgerminomas are associated with elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), which is sometimes used as a tumor marker.

==Signs and symptoms==

They are exceptionally associated with hypercalcemia. On gross examination, dysgerminomas present with a smooth, (knobby) external surface, and is soft, fleshy and either cream-coloured, gray, pink or tan when cut. Microscopic examination typically reveals uniform cells that resemble primordial germ cells. Typically, the stroma contains lymphocytes and about 20% of patients have sarcoid-like granulomas.
Metastases are most often present in the lymph nodes.

==Diagnosis==
LDH tumour markers is elevated in 95% of the cases.

==Treatment==
Dysgerminomas, like other seminomatous germ cell tumors, are very sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For this reason, with treatment patients&#x27; chances of long-term survival, even cure, is excellent. Targeted treatments for dysgerminomas that do not respond to chemotherapy are being evaluated.

<doc id="1169324" wikidata="Q1737977" url="?curid=1169324" title="Germ cell tumor">
<text>Germ cell tumor (GCT) is a neoplasm derived from the primordial germ cells. Germ-cell tumors can be cancerous or benign. Germ cells normally occur inside the gonads (ovary and testis). GCTs that originate outside the gonads may be birth defects resulting from errors during development of the embryo.

==Classification==

GCTs are classified by their histology, regardless of location in the body. However, as more information about the genetics of these tumors become available, they may be classified based on specific gene mutations that characterize specific tumors. They are broadly divided in two classes:
* The germinomatous or seminomatous germ-cell tumors (GGCT, SGCT) include only germinoma and its synonyms dysgerminoma and seminoma.
* The nongerminomatous or nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors (NGGCT, NSGCT) include all other germ-cell tumors, pure and mixed.

The two classes reflect an important clinical difference. Compared with germinomatous tumors, nongerminomatous tumors tend to grow faster, have an earlier mean age at time of diagnosis (around 25 years versus 35 years, in the case of testicular cancers), and have a lower five-year survival rate. The survival rate for germinomatous tumors is higher in part because these tumors are very sensitive to radiation, and they also respond well to chemotherapy. The prognosis for nongerminomatous tumours has improved dramatically, however, due to the use of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.

=== Germinomatous ===

=== Nongerminomatous ===

=== Mixed ===

Mixed germ cell tumors occur in many forms. Among these, a common form is teratoma with endodermal sinus tumor.

Teratocarcinoma refers to a germ cell tumor that is a mixture of teratoma with embryonal carcinoma, or with choriocarcinoma, or with both. This kind of mixed germ cell tumor may be known simply as a teratoma with elements of embryonal carcinoma or choriocarcinoma, or simply by ignoring the teratoma component and referring only to its malignant component: embryonal carcinoma and/or choriocarcinoma. They can present in the anterior mediastinum.

==Cause==

Some investigators suggest that this distribution arises as a consequence of abnormal migration of germ cells during embryogenesis. Others hypothesize a widespread distribution of germ cells to multiple sites during normal embryogenesis, with these cells conveying genetic information or providing regulatory functions at somatic sites.

Extragonadal GCTs were thought initially to be isolated metastases from an undetected primary tumor in a gonad, but many germ cell tumors are now known to be congenital and originate outside the gonads. The most notable of these is sacrococcygeal teratoma, the single most common tumor diagnosed in babies at birth.

Of all anterior mediastinal tumors, 15–20% are GCTs of which about 50% are benign teratomas. Ovarian teratomas may be associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

==Location==

Despite their name, GCTs occur both within and outside the ovary and testis. They are found in:}
* head
** inside the cranium — pineal and suprasellar locations are most commonly reported
** inside the mouth — a fairly common location for teratoma
* neck
* mediastinum — account for 1% to 5% of all germ cell neoplasms 
* pelvis, particularly sacrococcygeal teratoma
In females, GCTs account for 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 1 to 3% of ovarian cancers in North America. In younger women, they are more common, thus in patients under the age of 21, 60% of ovarian tumors are of the germ-cell type, and up to one-third are malignant. In males, GCTs of the testis occur typically after puberty and are malignant (testicular cancer). In neonates, infants, and children younger than 4 years, most are sacrococcygeal teratomas.

Males with Klinefelter syndrome have a 50 times greater risk of GSTs. In these persons, GSTs usually contain nonseminomatous elements, present at an earlier age, and seldom are gonadal in location.

==Treatment==
Women with benign GCTs such as mature teratomas (dermoid cysts) are cured by ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy. In general, all patients with malignant GCTs have the same staging surgery that is done for epithelial ovarian cancer. If the patient is in her reproductive years, an alternative is unilateral salpingoophorectomy, while the uterus, the ovary, and the fallopian tube on the opposite side can be left behind. This is not an option when the cancer is in both ovaries. If the patient has finished having children, the surgery involves complete staging, including salpingoophorectomy on both sides, as well as hysterectomy.

Patients with germ-cell cancer often need to be treated with combination chemotherapy for at least three cycles, but female patients with early-stage disease may not require this treatment. The chemotherapy regimen most commonly used in GCTs is called PEB (or BEP), and consists of bleomycin, etoposide, and a platinum-based antineoplastic (cisplatin). Targeted treatments, such as immunotherapy, hormonal therapy and kinase inhibitors, are being evaluated for tumors that do not respond to chemotherapy.

==Prognosis==

The 1997 International Germ Cell Consensus Classification is a tool for estimating the risk of relapse after treatment of malignant germ-cell tumor.

A small study of ovarian tumors in girls reports a correlation between cystic and benign tumors, and conversely, solid and malignant tumors. Because the cystic extent of a tumor can be estimated by ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan before surgery, this permits selection of the most appropriate surgical plan to minimize risk of spillage of a malignant tumor.

Access to appropriate treatment has a large effect on outcome. A 1993 study of outcomes in Scotland found that for 454 men with nonseminomatous (nongerminomatous) GCTs diagnosed between 1975 and 1989, five-year survival increased over time and with earlier diagnosis. Adjusting for these and other factors, survival was 60% higher for men treated in a cancer unit that treated the majority of these men, though the unit treated more men with the worst prognosis.

Choriocarcinoma of the testicles has the worst prognosis of all germ-cell cancers.

<text>The Idaho Legislature is the legislative branch of the government of the 43rd State of Idaho and is bicameral, consisting of the upper chamber of the Idaho Senate and the lower chamber of the Idaho House of Representatives. The state of Idaho is divided into 35 legislative districts, which each elect one state senator and two representatives. There are no term limits for reelection of members of either chamber.

The crossing of upper and lower chamber of their districts into a single representing constituency is found in only seven of the fifty U.S. state legislatures, these are: Idaho, Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington. Based on 2010 United States Decennial Census data, each legislative district in the state of Idaho had approximately 44,788 residents. Based on subsequent 2020 U.S. Decennial Census data, each legislative district had an ideal population of approximately 52,546 people.

== History ==
The first Idaho legislature convened in December 1890.

== Elections and composition ==
Members of the Idaho Legislature were originally elected by county, but in recent times districts apportioned by population have replaced representation by county.

Today members of the Idaho Legislature are elected from 35 districts throughout the state. Some districts include several counties, while others are located entirely within a single county. Ada County, the state&#x27;s largest by population, currently has nine legislative districts within its boundaries (as of the 2010 redistricting, Ada County has Legislative Districts 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.)

All 105 members are elected simultaneously every two years on the same day as the federal election day in early November.

== Districts ==
Each district is represented by one senator and two representatives. Idaho has fourteen committees in the House of Representatives and ten committees in the Senate. Currently, there are thirty-five members in the Senate with twenty-six men and nine women. The House of Representatives also currently holds seventy members with forty-six men and twenty-four women.

Districts are reapportioned every 10 years. The next reapportionment is expected to occur after the 2030 census and take effect as of the 2032 election.

In the 1980s voters elected legislators from two districts, a smaller local district and a larger &quot;floterial&quot; district which often encompassed an entire region of the state. Legislative seats in floterial districts were last contested in 1990. Today floterial districts are prohibited by the Idaho Constitution.
== Responsibilities ==
According to the Legislature&#x27;s website, the Idaho Legislature is responsible for translating the public will into policy for the state, levying taxes, appropriating public funds, and overseeing the administration of state agencies. These responsibilities are carried out through the legislative process - laws passed by elected representatives of the people, legislators.

== Location and time of operation ==

The Idaho Legislature normally convenes at the Idaho State Capitol in downtown Boise. The Legislature meets annually from January until mid-March, although sessions have been known to last into May. The Governor of Idaho may also call special sessions at any time.

The Idaho State Capitol Commission was created by Governor Phil Batt in 1998. The Commission undertook the leading role of extensively remodeling the capitol building starting in 2007. The 2008 and 2009 sessions of the Idaho Legislature met in converted courtrooms in the old Ada County Courthouse. The capitol building was official re-opened and re-dedicated on January 9, 2010.

<doc id="1169336" wikidata="Q112077" url="?curid=1169336" title="Cymburgis of Masovia">
<text>Cymburgis of Masovia (; ; 1394 or 1397 – 28 September 1429), also spelled Zimburgis or Cimburga, was a Princess of Masovia of the Polish Piast dynasty and a Duchess of Austria from 1412 until 1424, by her marriage with the Habsburg duke Ernest the Iron. As the mother of later Emperor Frederick III, Cymburgis, after Gertrude of Hohenberg, became the second female ancestor of all later Habsburgs, as only her husband&#x27;s Ernestine branch of the family survived in the male line.

==Life==
She was the second daughter of Duke Siemowit IV, a scion of the Masovian branch of the Piasts, and his consort Alexandra, a daughter of Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania from the dynasty of Gediminids and sister of King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland.

Though his elder brother William&#x27;s engagement with the Polish princess Jadwiga had mortifyingly failed, Duke Ernest the Iron, after the death of his first wife Margaret of Pomerania, proceeded to Kraków in disguise to court Cymburgis. According to legend, he won her love when he participated in a royal hunt and saved the princess from an attacking bear. Actually, her uncle King Władysław II, stuck in the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War and struggling with the Luxembourg king Sigismund of Hungary took the occasion to strengthen ties with the Habsburg dynasty and gave his consent.

The wedding took place on 25 January 1412 in Buda (), the residence of King Sigismund, in connection with Sigismunde hosti the peace negotiations between Poland and the Teutonic Order. after the Peace of Thorn (1411). where lavish feasts, tournaments, and hunts were organized. Present at the wedding were not only Cymburgis parents Siemowit and Alexandra, but also other notable guests like the bride&#x27;s maternal uncle Władysław II Jagiełło, with Anna of Cilli, but also Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Barbara of Cilli and Sigismund Korybut.

Though not approved by the Habsburg family, the marriage turned out to be a happy one. Upon the death of his brothers William and Leopold IV, Ernest became the sole ruler of the Inner Austrian territories, while his cousin Albert V ruled over the Duchy of Austria proper.

Although controversial, it has been claimed (since at least by Robert Burton in 1621) that she brought the distinctive protruding lower lip (prognathism) into the family, a particular physical characteristic of most members of the family for many generations until the 18th century. It can even be recognized in some of her distant descendants (though not as markedly) as King Alfonso XIII of Spain (1886–1941). 

Tradition has it that she was also known for her exceptional strength, which, for example, she showed by driving nails into the wall with her bare hands and cracking nuts between her fingers. Cymburgis outlived her husband and died on a pilgrimage to Mariazell while staying at Türnitz (in present-day Lower Austria). She is buried at Lilienfeld Abbey.

==Issue==
 Cymburgis was constantly pregnant during her marriage to Ernest, giving birth to nine children in just nine years, of whom only four survived childhood:

# Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (b. Innsbruck, 21 September 1415 – d. Linz, 19 August 1493).
# Margaret of Austria (b. Wiener Neustadt, 1416 – d. Altenburg, 12 February 1486), married Frederick II, Elector of Saxony.
# Albert VI, Archduke of Austria (b. Vienna, 18 December 1418 – d. Vienna, 2 December 1463).
# Catherine of Austria (b. Wiener Neustadt, 1420 – Schloss Hohenbaden, 11 September 1493), married Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden.
# Ernest II of Austria (b. Wiener Neustadt, 1420 - d. Wiener Neustadt, 10 August 1432), died in childhood.
# Alexandra of Austria (b. and d. Wiener Neustadt, 1421).
# Anna of Austria (b. Wiener Neustadt, 1422 – d. Wiener Neustadt, 11 November 1429), died in childhood.
# Leopold of Austria (b. and d. Wiener Neustadt, 1424).
# Rudolph of Austria (b. and d. Wiener Neustadt, 1424).

== Cymburgis in media ==

Cymburgis of Masovia is referenced to in the Maximilian (miniseries). 

In the Polish historical drama Korona królów (2018) season 4, she is depicted by the actress Aniela Płudowska.

<text>Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf (6 May 1893 – 21 December 1961) was a German politician (SPD). 

He joined the SPD in 1919. Kopf worked from 1939 to 1943 on behalf of the Nazi government as an asset manager in occupied Poland, initially with his own company together with the lawyer Edmund Bohne, later for the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost and was &quot;trustee of confiscated Polish and Jewish goods&quot; and worked as an expropriation commissioner in the Lubliniec region. In 1948, Polish authorities requested his extradition for being involved in deportations, harassing and abusing Polish workers, and confiscating Jewish property, but Military Governor Robertson dismissed the allegations saying they were &quot;insufficient&quot;.

He served as Prime Minister of the short-lived State of Hanover in 1946 and then as Minister President of Lower Saxony from 1946 to 1955 and from 1959 to 1961. He served as the third President of the Bundesrat from 7 September 1951 to 6 September 1952.

Kopf was born in Neuenkirchen, Hanover, and died in Göttingen.

His grave is located in the Stöcken city cemetery in Hanover and was a so-called honorary grave of the city of Hanover until 2015, whose administration decorated it with flowers and cared for it.

<doc id="1169348" wikidata="Q591925" url="?curid=1169348" title="Spanish Legion">
<text>For centuries, Spain recruited foreign soldiers to its army, forming the foreign regiments () such as the Regiment of Hibernia (formed in 1709 from Irishmen who fled their own country in the wake of the Flight of the Earls and the penal laws). However, the specific unit of the Spanish Army and Spain&#x27;s Rapid Reaction Force, now known as the Spanish Legion (), and informally known as the Tercio or the Tercios, is a 20th-century creation. It was raised in the 1920s to serve as part of Spain&#x27;s Army of Africa. The unit, which was established in January 1920 as the Spanish equivalent of the French Foreign Legion, was initially known as the (&quot;Tercio of foreigners&quot;), the name under which it began fighting in the Rif War of 1921–1926. 

Over the years, the force&#x27;s name has changed from to (when the field of operations targeted Morocco), and by the end of the Rif War it became the &quot;Spanish Legion&quot;, with several &quot;tercios&quot; as sub-units.

The Legion played a major role in the Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. In post-Franco Spain, the modern Legion has undertaken tours of duty in the Yugoslav Wars, Afghanistan, Iraq and Operation Libre Hidalgo UNIFIL.

==History==
The Spanish Legion was formed by royal decree of King Alfonso XIII on 28 January 1920, with the Minister of War stating, &quot;With the designation of Foreigners Regiment there will be created an armed military unit, whose recruits, uniform and regulations by which they should be governed will be set by the minister of war.&quot; In the 1920s the Spanish Legion&#x27;s five battalions were filled primarily by native Spaniards (since foreigners were not easy to recruit) with most of its foreign members coming from the Republic of Cuba.

===Predecessor===
Historically there had been a &quot;Spanish Foreign Legion&quot; which preceded the modern Legion&#x27;s formation in 1920. On 28 June 1835, the French government had decided to hand over to the Spanish government the French Foreign Legion in support of Queen Isabella&#x27;s claim to the Spanish throne during the First Carlist War. The French Foreign Legion, with around 4,000 men, landed at Tarragona on 17 August 1835. This became the first Spanish Legion until it was disbanded on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men.

===The Title of Spanish Legion===
The Spanish Legion was modelled on the French Foreign Legion. Its purpose was to provide a corps of professional troops to fight in Spain&#x27;s colonial campaigns in North Africa, in place of conscript units that were proving ineffective. The first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel José Millán-Astray Terreros, referred to his unit as ‘La Legión’ from the start but this only became part of the unit&#x27;s title from 1937.

In the original there were Latin Americans, amongst others, one Chinese, three Japanese, one Maltese, one Russian, both German &amp; Austrian, one Italian, two Frenchmen, four Portuguese, one Belgian, unknown Filipino and one Spanish woman from Puerto Rico. However, soon the majority of its members were Spaniards who joined to fight outside of European Spain.

 () is an old Spanish military term that roughly translates as ‘regiment&#x27; (originally it had enough manpower to be considered a half-brigade). In the 18th century tercios were replaced by regiments. There is no equivalent word in English. Dating from the 16th century, the name was chosen to evoke the era of Spain&#x27;s military supremacy as the leading Catholic power in Europe under the Habsburg Emperors. Organised into in 1534, the Spanish infantry gained a reputation for invincibility.

In 1925, the unit title was changed to (&quot;Tercio of Morocco&quot;). This was soon abbreviated to ‘The Tercio’. In 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War, the was renamed , the name by which it is still known today.

===Early campaigns===
The Spanish Legion&#x27;s first major campaign was in Spanish North Africa. In 1920 Spain was facing a major rebellion in the Protectorate of Spanish Morocco, led by the able Rif leader Abd el-Krim. On 2 September 1920, King Alfonso XIII conferred command of the new regiment on Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry José Millán-Astray, chief proponent of its establishment. Millán-Astray was an able soldier but an eccentric and extreme personality. His style and attitude would become part of the mystique of the legion.

On 20 September 1920 the first recruit joined the new legion, a date which is now celebrated annually. The initial make-up of the regiment was that of a headquarters unit and three battalions (known as &quot;Banderas&quot;, lit. &quot;banners&quot;- another archaic 16th century term). Each battalion was in turn made up of a headquarters company, two rifle companies and a machine gun company. The regiment&#x27;s initial location was at the Cuartel del Rey en Ceuta on the Plaza de Colón. At its height, during the Spanish Civil War, the legion consisted of 18 &quot;banderas&quot;, plus a tank &quot;bandera&quot;, an assault engineer &quot;bandera&quot; and a Special Operations Group. &quot;Banderas&quot; 12 to 18 were considered independent units and never served as part of the additional &quot;tercios&quot; into which the legion was organised.

Francisco Franco was one of the leaders of the legion and the unit&#x27;s second-in-command, concurrently commanding the 1st Legion Bandera. The legion fought in Morocco in the War of the Rif (to 1926). Together with the &quot;Regulares&quot; (Moorish colonial troops), the legion made up the Spanish Army of Africa. In October 1934 units of both the legion and the &quot;Regulares&quot; were brought to Spain by the Republican Government to help put down a workers revolt in the area of Asturias.
Under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Juan Yagüe, the Army of Africa played an important part in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side. The professionalism of both the legion and the &quot;Regulares&quot; gave Franco&#x27;s rebel troops a significant initial advantage over the less well trained Spanish Republican forces. The Army of Africa remained an elite spearhead until the expansion of the rebel armies after April 1937 led to the legion and Moroccan units being distributed across several fronts. Following the Francoist victory in 1939, the legion was reduced in size and returned to its bases in Spanish Morocco. It was only after then that the legion attained its present composition of 4 Tercios, and the names given to them, the 4th Tercio of the legion was established later in 1950:

 1st Tercio &quot;Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba&quot;
 2nd Tercio &quot;Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba&quot;
 3rd Tercio &quot;Don Juan of Austria&quot;
 4th Tercio &quot;Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma&quot;

When Morocco gained its independence in 1956 the legion continued in existence as part of the garrison of the remaining Spanish enclaves and territories in North Africa. The legion fought Moroccan irregulars in the Ifni War in 1957–58.

On 17 June 1970, Legion units opened fire and killed between two and eleven demonstrators at the Zemla neighbourhood in El Aaiun, Spanish Sahara, modern day Western Sahara. The incident, which became known as the Zemla Intifada, had a significant influence on pushing the Sahrawi anticolonial movement into embarking on an armed struggle which continues, though Spain has long since abandoned the territory and handed it over to Morocco.

Through the course of the legion&#x27;s history Spaniards (including natives of the colony of Spanish Guinea) have made up the majority of its members, with foreigners accounting for 25 percent or less. During the Rif War of the 1920s most of the foreigners serving with the legion were Spanish speaking Latin Americans.

==Modern legion==
In the 2000s, after the abandonment of conscription, the Spanish Legion once again accepted foreigners into service. Male and female native Spanish speakers, mostly from Central American and South American states, were included.

Today, acceptance to the Spanish Legion is based on the following criteria:
*Be a Spanish citizen; although citizens from former Spanish territories also can join (foreign recruits are required to have a valid Spanish residence permit).
*Be a citizen in good legal standing
*Not be deprived of civil rights
*Be at least 18 years of age and not be 29 on the day of joining boot camp.
*Be able to pass psychological, physical and medical evaluations
In recent years, the Spanish Legion was involved in Bosnia as part of the SFOR. It also took part in the Iraq War, deploying in Najaf alongside Salvadoran troops, until the new Spanish government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero fulfilled its electoral promises by withdrawing Spanish troops from Iraq. The legion units deployed in Iraq were involved in several operations against the insurgency. In 2005, the legion was deployed in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Stabilisation Force (ISAF). In 2006, the 10th Bandera was sent to Southern Lebanon as part of United Nations&#x27; Operation UNIFIL.

===Present role and deployment===
The Spanish Legion is now mostly used in NATO peacekeeping missions. It has 5,000 soldiers in a Brigade of two Tercios (regiments) based in Ronda, Málaga and Viator, Almería (Andalusia). Two other independent &quot;tercios&quot; are deployed in the Spanish African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla as part of their respective garrisons. The legion is directly controlled by the Spanish General Staff.

Although the detachment at Málaga was transferred away, each year a company of legionaries from one of the Tercios (regiments) returns to march in the Holy Week procession with the &quot;Christ of the Good Death&quot;, a life-size effigy of Christ Crucified, adopted by the legion as Patron in the 1920s. It also has its own confraternity with its home chapel located in this historic city, where veterans who served in this unit are counted among its membership. The Legion&#x27;s detachments also take part in various Holy Week events nationwide, including its military band.

==Units constituting modern Spanish Legion==
The currently active units of the Spanish Legion are: 
* II Spanish Legion Brigade &quot;Rey Alfonso XIII&quot; in Viator
** 2nd Spanish Legion Headquarters Bandera
** 2nd Spanish Legion Light Armored Cavalry Group &quot;Reyes Católicos&quot;
** 3rd Spanish Legion Tercio &quot;Don Juan de Austria&quot;
*** VII Spanish Legion Bandera &quot;Valenzuela&quot;
*** VIII Spanish Legion Bandera &quot;Colón&quot;
** 4th Spanish Legion Tercio &quot;Alejandro Farnesio&quot;
*** X Spanish Legion Bandera &quot;Millán Astray&quot;
** 2nd Spanish Legion Field Artillery Group
** 2nd Spanish Legion Engineer Battalion
** 2nd Spanish Legion Logistic Group

In other commands:
* 1st Spanish Legion Tercio &quot;Gran Capitán&quot;
** I Spanish Legion Bandera &quot;España&quot;
* 2nd Spanish Legion Tercio &quot;Duque de Alba&quot;
** IV Spanish Legion Bandera &quot;Cristo de Lepanto&quot;
===Special Forces of the Spanish Legion===
The legion has a special operations unit known as the (19th Legion Special Operations Battalion or BOEL). The members of this unit, who were (and still mostly are) volunteers from other banderas of the legion, received training in: SCUBA/Maritime Warfare, Arctic and Mountain Warfare, Sabotage and Demolitions, Parachute and HALO techniques, Long Range Reconnaissance, Counter-terrorism and CQB, Vehicle insertion, Sniping and SERE (&quot;Survival, Escape, Resistance and Evasion&quot;). Much of the training was undertaken at Fort Bragg (USA). In 2002 the BOEL was renamed &quot;19th Special Operations Group &quot;Maderal Oleaga&quot;&quot; (GOE-XIX) and was moved to Alicante, and reported directly to Army HQ as part of the Special Operations Command, with recruitment now being in a national basis, with personnel assigned from various Army units. In 2019-20, the battalion returned to the Legion Command but is not part of the Legion Brigade, assigned as the Legion contribution to Army SpecOps.

* 19th Special Operations Group &quot;Maderal Oleaga&quot;

==Ranks==
The military ranks and promotion conditions of the Spanish Legion are the same as those applicable to the remainder of the Spanish Army. Formerly the Legion had its own rank system for non-commissioned officers. The only modern difference is that soldiers (OR-1) in the Legion are referred to as &quot;Caballeros Legionarios&quot; (Legionary Gentlemen). Legionnaires consider this title as a distinction, earned through rigorous training and initiation tests.

==Basic training==
Basic training lasts four months and takes place in Cáceres or Cádiz. It includes basic military skills, forced marches and a stringent assault course. After the second month, the recruit signs a 2 or 3-year contract. After finishing basic training the recruit joins one of the tercios, in there he receives further training, taking from 1 month to 10 months depending on the specialty assigned. This is the same process as in the rest of units in the Spanish army.
==Uniforms and equipment of the legion==

===Uniforms===
From its establishment the legion was noted for its plain and simple style of dress, in contrast to the colourful dress uniforms worn by the Peninsular regiments of the Spanish Army until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1931. This was part of the cult of austerity favoured by a unit that considered itself on more or less continual active service.

The modern legion has the same camouflage dress for active service and ordinary duties as the rest of the Spanish Army but retains the unique, sage green Tropical Uniform for semi-formal barrack dress and as the basis of Legion parade uniform. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the modern legion uniform is the khaki &quot;gorrillo&quot; cap or &quot;chapiri&quot;, with red hanging tassel and piping.

Contrary to usual military practice, Legionaries are allowed to sport beards and are permitted to wear their uniforms, both traditional and service, open at the chest.

===Equipment===
The basic weapons used by the Legion are the same as those used by the rest of the Spanish Army. These include the G36-E rifle, its 40 mm grenade launcher modular attachment the AG36, the HK MG4 and MG3 machine guns, and the HK USP 9mm pistol.

Like the rest of the Army, the Legion makes use of crew served weapons such as the M2 Browning machine gun and the SB LAG 40 automatic grenade launcher on their armoured vehicles.

The Legions field artillery group mans L118 105mm Light Guns, Italian wheeled tank destroyers B1 Centauro also are used.

The Legion uses Land Rovers, Spanish-made BMR and VEC-M1, VAMTAC, URO trucks and other vehicles like foreign LMV or RG31.
==Esprit de corps==
Millán-Astray provided the Legion with a distinctive spirit and symbolism intended to evoke Spain&#x27;s Imperial and Christian traditions. For instance, the Legion adopted the regimental designation of &quot;tercio&quot; in memory of the 16th-century Spanish infantry formations that had toppled nations and terrorized the battlefields of Europe in the days of Charles V. Millán-Astray also revived the Spaniards&#x27; ancient feud with the Moors and portrayed his men first as crusaders on an extended &quot;Reconquista&quot; against Islamic civilization, and later as the saviours of Spain warding off Communism and democratic liberalism defeating the &quot;dangerous spectre of &#x27;Eastern Atheism&quot;&#x27;.

As a tribute to the old Tercios the Legion coat of arms features, besides the crown, weapons used by the soldiers of these units - the musket, halberd and crossbow.

===Traditions===
The Legion&#x27;s customs and traditions include the following:

* Its members, regardless of rank, are titled &quot;Caballero Legionario&quot; (&quot;Legionary Gentleman&quot;). When women are admitted, they are titled &quot;Dama Legionaria&quot; (&quot;Legionary Lady&quot;).
* A &quot;Mística Legionaria&quot; (&quot;Legionary Spirit&quot;) (condensed in a twelve-point &quot;:es:Credo Legionario&quot;, or &quot;Legionary Creed&quot;)
* Legionaries consider themselves &quot;Novios de la muerte&quot; (&quot;bridegrooms of death&quot;). This nickname is also the title of one of two official hymns of the Legion, the other one being &quot;La Canción del Legionario&quot; (&quot;The Legionary&#x27;s Song&quot;). This comes from the first years of the corps, when it only admitted men.
* A Legionary in distress shouts &quot;¡A mí la Legión!&quot; (&quot;To me the Legion!&quot;). Those within earshot are bound to help him, regardless of the circumstances. In practice, Legionaries are never supposed to abandon a comrade on the battlefield.
* The Legion&#x27;s march step is faster than the Spanish military standard, being 160-180 steps per minute in contrast to the usual 90 steps per minute.
*During the Holy Week processions in Málaga, the Legionaries carry on their shoulders the image of the Christ of Good Death on Holy Thursday morning. Later that same afternoon, they accompany the procession through the streets of Málaga.
* Under the command of José Millán-Astray, the Legion&#x27;s motto was &quot;¡Viva la muerte!&quot; (&quot;Long live death!&quot;) It fell into disuse after the death of Francisco Franco.

* The Legion has had several mascots during its history, such as monkeys, chickens, capercaillies, wild boars, barbary sheep (Spanish: &quot;arruis&quot;), bears, and parrots. The modern mascot is the Goat of the Spanish Legion. It usually appears at parades and ceremonies, wearing a Legion cap and accompanied by a Legionary, alongside the Legion&#x27;s marker guard (&quot;gastadores&quot;), leading the marching troops.
* While throughout its history the Legion has been an essentially infantry force it has also included armoured, artillery and engineer units. During the 1920s and early 1930s, a squadron of mounted &quot;lanceros&quot; (lancers) formed part of the Legion and in 1982, a mounted section of the &quot;Polícia Militar de la Legión&quot; was formed to carry the traditional lances and pennants during Holy Week Processions in Málaga to continue the practice.
* The Military bands and Bugle bands of the Legion continue the unit&#x27;s musical traditions since the 1920s. The bugle bands of the Legion, together with the &quot;Regulares&quot;, are the only such bands in the Spanish Armed Forces to never use the valved bugle but use the plain bugle instead. Together with the Parachute Light Infantry Brigade, they are also are the only ones to use the small &quot;cornetín&quot; or the piccolo bugle, used for ordering commands and leading the bugle band in playing bugle calls, fanfares or marches. The medium &quot;cornetín&quot; is used by the other branches.
* Formerly, the Legion did its marchpasts in the same way as the rest of the Spanish Armed Forces. Today, all officers and the colour guards only do a hand salute and eyes right when marching past. When on the halt and giving full salutes, they only do a hand salute.

==Anthems and marches of the legion==

=== Slow march ===

&quot;El Novio de la Muerte&quot; (&quot;Bridegroom of Death&quot;) is the unofficial hymn and regimental slow march of the Spanish Legion, composed in 1921 with words by Juan Costa set to music by Fidel Prado.

=== Regimental quick marches and official anthem ===
Composed in 1920, &quot;La Cancion del Legionario&quot; (&quot;The Legionnare&#x27;s Song&quot;) is the official quick march and anthem of the Legion. It was composed by Modesto Romero and Infantry Commandant Emilio Guillén Pedemonti. It is played by the military bands and bugle bands of the Legion at the regulation 190 beats that it exclusively uses.

Before it became the legion&#x27;s official march, &quot;Le Madelon&quot; and &quot;Tercios Heroicos&quot; (&quot;Heroic Tercios&quot;) by Francisco Calles and Antonio Soler were its official march past tunes.

<doc id="1169349" wikidata="Q2301558" url="?curid=1169349" title="Matriz (Horta)">
<text>Matriz is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Horta, in the Portuguese Azores, which is part of the urbanized core of the city of Horta. The population in 2011 was 2,562, in an area of 1.81 km². It is the smallest and most populous parish on the island. It contains the localities Matriz and Dutras.

==History==
It was the second Captain-major of Faial, Joss d&#x27;Utra, son of the Flemish pioneer Josse van Huerter, that originally settled and developed the area of Matriz. The religious parish, Matriz do Santissimo Salvador, was created from successive growth of the village of Horta in 1498, by the royal decree of King Manuel I of Portugal.

The primitive Church Matriz de São Salvador was completed and inaugurated on June 28, 1514; it complements the Flemish church of the same name in Bruges and the Sé of Angra do Heroísmo. It was successively sacked in 1589, then 1597, by English privateers.

In 1643, Diogo das Chagas identified that the area of the Matriz had about 1,985 inhabitants in 449 homes. It was also a centre of the faith community during the period of exploration; the home to several churches and religious sanctuaries, that include: the Jesuit Church and Convent, the Church of Misericórdia (Mercy), the Convent of São João, the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Glória, the Convento de Santo António, the Império dos Nobres (in homage to the 1672 volcanic eruption) and the old Clock Tower (former tower of another destroyed church).

==Geography==
Matriz is buttressed between its urban neighbors Angústias (along its southern border), Conceição (along its northern), and the landlocked parish of Flamengos (towards the west)): it fronts Horta Bay, and the island of Pico towards the east. Generally, the parish is a gently sloping tract of land that slopes towards the interior (Flamengos), that is highly urbanized and which constitutes the core the city of Horta.

Most commercial, administrative and residential uses are concentrated in this parish, including the Regional Assembly, many of the historical churches (including Igreja Matriz do SS.º Salvador da Horta), convents and social services, antique farmers market, post office, archive and other public buildings. Landmarks includes the Horta Museum, Sociedade Recreativa Amor da Pátria, Império dos Nobres (Empire of Nobles), Horta&#x27;s clock tower, the former Walter Bensaúde Hospital (future expansion of the Department of Oceanography and Ichthyology of the University of the Azores, a panoramic view at Monte Carneiro and the Horta Archive and the Public Library (the old Bensaúde House, Port.: &quot;Casa Bensaúde&quot;).

<text>Beaubassin was an important Acadian village and trading centre on the Isthmus of Chignecto in what is now Nova Scotia, Canada. The area was a significant place in the geopolitical struggle between the British and French empires. It was established in the 1670s on an upland close to an extensive area of saltwater marsh. Settlers reclaimed the land to engage in cattle ranching and trade.

==French colony==
The settlement had strong ties with Port Royal, and Jacques Bourgeois, a farmer, shipbuilder, and merchant at sold a part of his holdings there to settle in the Chignecto Basin, where he built a flour-mill and a saw-mill. Around the same time Michel Leneuf de la Vallière de Beaubassin set up a fur-trading post on the isthmus, while devoting part of his time to the fishing, farming, settlement, and soldiering. Following success in the latter activity, in 1676 governor Frontenac granted him 100 square leagues land which became the Beaubassin seigneury. He established himself on an upland known as Île de la Vallière, later Tonge&#x27;s Island.

The settlement prospered on the fertile Tantramar Marshes and surrounding high ground, suitable for farming. The isthmus was also the site of a portage between the Bay of Fundy and the Northumberland Strait and lay at the heart of a vast trading network encompassing Île Royale, Nova Scotia and New England.

The first fruit trees were brought from Port Royal by an Irishman, Roger Kuessey (Caissy or Quessey), who established himself on a highland now known as the Butte à Roger. In 1685 the site was inspected by intendant Jacques de Meulles who reported that the grasslands around the settlement was sufficient to fatten thousands of head of cattle, that there were 22 habitations, of which most had a dozen or more cattle and as many each of pigs and sheep, but that not much land was cultivated.

In 1686, Beaubassin was made a parish when Abbot Claude Trouvé built a church. The settlement eventually extended up to Mill Creek, Petitcodiac, Memramcook, and the Shepody Rivers.

By 1715, it is thought that Beaubassin was home to 50 families, 32 acres of apple orchards, 1,000 head of cattle, and 800 hogs. There was also a trading post which traded with Louisbourg (in present-day Cape Breton) via Baie Verte and the Northumberland Strait, and New England, via the Bay of Fundy.

By 1750, the population was about 2,800. Other villages in the immediate area included Weskak (now Westcock), Pré-des-Bourgs (Sackville), Pré-des-Richards (Middle Sackville), and Aulac. About half of the population were refugees from mainland Nova Scotia.

== Beginnings of warfare ==
The settlement was subject to attacks from New England starting with the 1696 Raid on Chignecto during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, led by Benjamin Church. In 1704 he returned and attacked the Beaubassin region again.

== Destruction ==

Beaubassin was located at a site of strategic military importance. The peace and prosperity of Beaubassin was ended by rivalry between Britain and France for the control of Canada in the mid 1700s. Acadia comprised most of what is now the Maritimes, as well as parts of Québec, and northern Maine. With the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, the part of Acadia today known as peninsular Nova Scotia became another British colony on the eastern seaboard. The area now known as New Brunswick remained under French control, as did what are now known as Prince Edward Island (then known as Île Saint-Jean) and Cape Breton Island (then known as Île Royale).

Due to disagreements in interpretation of the treaty provisions delineating Acadia&#x27;s boundaries, the ownership of New Brunswick was disputed. An informal dividing line was established on the Isthmus of Chignecto at the Missiguash River, near the site of Beaubassin.

In May 1750, the British dispatched Major Charles Lawrence, along with 800 troops, to seize control of the Isthmus of Chignecto and construct a fort near the French post of Point Beauséjour, future site of Fort Beauséjour.

As the British arrived, the French and their allies burned the town to prevent its use by the enemy. Forty-five buildings were burned. The Acadian population abandoned the village and sought refuge on the other side of the Missaguash River on Point Beauséjour. Major Lawrence and his troops later built Fort Lawrence near the site. The bell was saved from Notre Dame d&#x27;Assumption Church and eventually put it into a cathedral at Fort Beauséjour.

== Aftermath ==
The British occupancy of the Isthmus of Chignecto marked the beginning of the end of French power in Acadia. Less than five years later, British and New England troops used Fort Lawrence as their base to capture Fort Beausejour in June 1755, followed soon after by the Expulsion of the Acadians from the area.

== The site today ==
In 2004, Parks Canada acquired a significant portion of the lands on which Beaubassin once stood and the site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2005. The site includes the separately designated Fort Lawrence National Historic Site. There is a stone marker near the Nova Scotia visitor centre off the Trans-Canada Highway in Amherst, Nova Scotia commemorating the village&#x27;s existence.

The pastured fields of the former Beaubassin village contain extensive archaeological resources including glass and ceramic artifacts and charred buildings that attest to the Acadian way of life. Modern buildings have impacted the archaeological resources, but much of the land is still agricultural or marshland. Cellar depressions demarcate the buildings that once made up the settlement.

<doc id="1169356" wikidata="Q1997380" url="?curid=1169356" title="Praia do Almoxarife">
<text>Praia do Almoxarife is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) of Horta, of the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 834, in an area of 9.20 km2. Although it was the beachhead of early settlement on the island, its population has not grown significantly since it was settled. It has become an important summer destination and tourist center for its long black sand beach.

==History==

Praia was originally a beachhead of settlement on Faial, first used by as a beachhead for explorers, and then by new colonists coming to settle the central group of the Azores. In 1466, Josse van Huerter and his Flemish compatriots landed on the beach in a misguided hope of discovery precious metals (in particular tin and silver). Their settlement abridged the &quot;Lomba dos Frades&quot;, where they stayed for about a year. There was a falling out between Huerter and his crew, and he narrowly escaped the island with his life. He later returned in 1466-67, with a commission from the Duchess of Burgundy to settle and populate the islands in the name of the crown of Portugal. Quickly, he discovered that the area&#x27;s limitations continued, and he abandoned this settlement in favour of the adjacent valley, later known as the &quot;Vale dos Flamengos&quot; (&quot;Valley of the Flemings&quot;); some island chroniclers blamed the abandon of Praia on the lack of a potable water source.

Meanwhile, other settlers continued to occupy this region, where a small settlement persisted through the decades. Praia, likely, received its current toponymy (based in Moorish or Islamic origin) for being the point of settlement for the administrator of lands or royal treasurer on the island; &quot;almoxarife&quot; means &quot;treasurer&quot;, a term now in disuse in Portugal, but which refers to an agent responsible for guarding, distributing, inventorying goods or supplies.

On 12 September 1597, English privateers sacked and burned down the buildings in the parish.

By 1643, friar Diogo das Chagas, noted that the parish consisted of 305 inhabitants dispersed within the valley.

On 1 February 1718, many residents gathered at the &quot;Casa da Câmara&quot; (&quot;Municipal House&quot;), in Horta, following the catastrophic eruption on the island of Pico, which disturbed the parishes of Santa Luzia and Bandeiras. From here, the local residents travelled in procession to the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (&quot;Our Lady of the Conception&quot;), with an image of &quot;Senhor Santo Cristo&quot;, which was met by another group of faithful carrying a statue of the Virgin Mary. At the church the groups prayed for &quot;redemption and mercy&quot;. During the course of their benedictions, the community made a pledge to continue to celebrate masses of penance, devotion and thanksgiving on future anniversaries in the name of &quot;Senhor Santo Cristo&quot;; as they pledged &quot;for every year as long as the earth existed...at the municipality&#x27;s expense...with all officials...assisted by all communities, to be made at your church of Praia...at all expense necessary&quot;.

Following the beginning of the First Portuguese Republic until 1926, owing to an anti-religious secularism in the political administration in Portugal (and the Azores), the masses of thanksgiving were discontinued. After the 1926 Horta earthquake which destroyed 204 houses out of 220 in Praia do Almoxarife, a new petition by citizens, to renew the tradition, was forwarded to the &quot;Ministério do Interior&quot; (&quot;Ministry of the Interior&quot;), where the minister authorized the chief of the district to renew the tradition.

==Geography==
Nestled between &quot;Lomba da Espalamaca&quot; and &quot;Lomba dos Frades&quot;, the parish is primarily an agricultural settlement. Bisected by the eastern Regional Road E.R.1-1ª, the community is divided to an eastern beach community, and western pastureland that extends westerly to the island&#x27;s caldera. The parish contains the localities Caminho do Meio, Canada dos Cedros, Facho, Fenandega, Ladeira da Praia, Lomba, Praia, Ramada and Rocha Vermelha.

== Sights and architecture ==
Close to &quot;Largo Coronel Silva Leal&quot;, the centre of the municipality, several old houses built in the traditional style of the island can be seen in the small lanes of &quot;Rua da Igreja&quot; and &quot;Rua Padre António Cândido Avelar&quot;.

&quot;Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Graça&quot;, the comparatively large parish church, was mentioned in a document in 1568 for the first time. Having been burnt by privateers in 1597 it was rebuilt in a baroque style in 1758 with two side chapels and two tall towers. The church was severely damaged by an earthquake on 9 July 1998 and repaired afterwards.

A small park with a pavilion was laid out in front of the church. Opposite the church a small Holy Spirit Chapel was built, &quot;Império da Trindade&quot;. The years 1873 and 1943 were painted onto the façade, 1873 referring to the construction and 1943 referring to the renovation of the chapel.

==Economy==

Due to its relative proximity to Horta, the community has become a surrogate for tourist and summer vacationers due to its beach. This has steadily become an important primary economic resource, overtaking the traditional agriculture and dairy production, which is primarily concentrated to the west of the Regional Road. There is a certain touristic infrastructure around &quot;Largo Coronel Silva Leal&quot; the central square of Praia do Almoxarife.

<text>Dartmouth Broadcasting began in 1924 when members of the amateur radio club obtained a federal license to broadcast on the AM band, at 1170 kHz, as WFBK. Later renamed WDCH, the station continued until the fall of 1925 when an inadvertent obscenity uttered over the air caused the college president, Ernest Martin Hopkins, to permanently shut it down. Radio finally returned to Dartmouth in 1941 due to the efforts of a group of determined students (led by Richard Krolik, class of 1941) and younger faculty who persuaded Hopkins to give the students a second chance.

The new station, dubbed DBS, at first broadcast via tiny transmitters in each dormitory, each operating on a different frequency. In 1942 this unwieldy arrangement was changed to a &quot;carrier current&quot; system using the college electrical system to reach the dormitories. In 1948 the call letters were changed to WDBS, and in 1958, after considerable controversy, the station obtained a standard AM broadcast license. On March 4, 1958 the students began broadcasting to the entire Upper Valley region as WDCR at 1340 KHz on the dial. Dartmouth Broadcasting launched WFRD (FM Radio at Dartmouth) 99.3 FM on February 19, 1976.

==Student governance==
Throughout most of its history the two stations were completely managed by students. Even today the vast majority of the on-air personnel are students, although there are some exceptions (such as the football play-by-play announcers.) This is an unusual example of student-run commercial radio. The management of the stations is by the Directorate consisting of: General Manager, Finance Director, AM Program Director, FM Program Director, Technical Director, Marketing/Alumni Relations, FM Promotions Director, News Director, Sports Director, Internet Director, and Training Director.

==Current organization==

*WFRD is the FM portion of Dartmouth&#x27;s radio program, also known as 99Rock. 99Rock broadcasts across the entire Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region (i.e., west-central New Hampshire), along with adjacent east-central Vermont. Though a classic rock format until the early 2000s, 99Rock now runs active rock music 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, showcasing bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, Pearl Jam, and Sublime. On June 22, 2021, Dartmouth announced its intention to sell the broadcast license for WFRD and use the proceeds of the sale to fund the student-run online station.
*Dartmouth Election Network works with Dartmouth Broadcast News to provide election coverage year round. Every four years, it offers special election-night coverage during the famous New Hampshire primary. In 1988, they made a legendary faux pas when they called the Primary for Dick Gephardt, based on stronger than expected early returns: Gephardt in fact lost to Michael S. Dukakis by 16 percentage points, 36% to 20%. However, the coverage is of high quality and is sometimes syndicated to conventional radio stations. Dartmouth Broadcasting also covers other major elections as well as the two major parties&#x27; quadrennial conventions.
*Dartmouth Broadcast News has several news programs running on WDCR and WFRD. The news department works to provide listeners with timely updates of relevant news.

==Former facilities==
*WDCR was the College&#x27;s AM station and broadcast a wide variety of music, news, and sports. Having at different times been a talk, Top 40, and alternative rock station. Its signal usually only reached the immediate Hanover-Lebanon-White River Junction area. In October 2008, WDCR ceased over the air broadcasting, having established streaming over the internet. In September 2010, WDCR&#x27;s license was returned to the F.C.C..

==Finances==
Dartmouth Broadcasting receives little direct funding from Dartmouth College, although its studios are located on campus, and it is officially owned by the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees. Money for operating expenses comes from local and national advertisers. The FM transmitter is off-campus in the neighboring community of West Lebanon, New Hampshire.

<text>The Ethical Culture Fieldston School (ECFS), also known more simply as Fieldston or Ethical Culture, is a private pre-K–12th grade coeducational school in New York City with two campuses, in Manhattan and in the Bronx. The school is a member of the Ivy Preparatory School League. The school serves approximately 1,700 students with 480 faculty and staff.

The school consists of four divisions: Ethical Culture (Pre-K through 5th grade, located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan), Fieldston Lower (in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, also serves Pre-K through 5th grade), Fieldston Middle (6th–8th grades, in Riverdale), and Fieldston Upper (9th–12th grades, in Riverdale). Tuition and fees for ECFS were $60,595 for the 2022–2023 school year and $63,020 for the 2023–2024 school year.

==History==

The school opened in 1878 as a free kindergarten, founded by Felix Adler at the age of 24. In 1880, elementary grades were added, and the school was then called the Workingman&#x27;s School. By 1890 the school&#x27;s academic reputation encouraged many more wealthy parents to seek it out, and the school was expanded to accommodate the upper-class as well, and began charging tuition; in 1895 the name changed to &quot;The Ethical Culture School&quot;, and in 1903 the New York Society for Ethical Culture became its sponsor. Fieldston awards over $15 million in tuition-based financial aid to 22% of the student body.

One of the early faculty members was American sociologist Lewis Hine.

In March 1970, about 60 students occupied the administration building in protest to demand that more black and Puerto Rican students be admitted to the school. They also aimed to have a greater number of minority courses, teachers, advisors, employees. The school agreed to some of the student demands.

===Recent developments===

Beginning in 2015, the school began separating children for mandatory weekly &quot;affinity group&quot; meetings based on their self-identified race, to discuss issues of race and bias. The experimental trial program was met with controversy from some Fieldston parents.

In February 2019, a video that is believed to have been created years previously was discovered by administrators after it was shared during a dispute between students. The students in the video use derogatory and racist language. Students involved who were still enrolled in the school were punished; however, some students who thought the actions were not enough staged a sit-in. Students occupied the administration building overnight throughout the week, receiving widespread support from the student body and many parents. The students presented the administrators with demands that included increased racial bias training, more faculty of color, more students of color recruitment, and a required ethnic studies course; the students&#x27; demands were agreed to and are planned to be implemented. The student organization SOCM (Students of Color Matter) continued after the end of the occupation of the administration building, and currently works to implement initiatives based on the original 16 demands.

The school also attracted attention in November 2019 after it hosted a guest speaker who compared the Israeli treatment of Palestinians to the Holocaust, a statement which was denounced as antisemitic, including two Reform Jewish rabbis who spoke at the school in the wake of the controversy and subsequently published a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial about the incident.

In January 2020, the school fired a tweeting Jewish teacher who opposed the invitation of two speakers on anti-Semitism because they were, according to him, &quot;white&quot; and Zionists. Some parents asked for the teacher&#x27;s reinstatement. The Israeli-Palestinian war increased tensions yet again on the Fieldston campus, leading to more controversy and press-coverage of the high school.

==Academics==
The core of their educational program is the study and practice of ethics which is infused throughout the interdisciplinary curriculum. Whole-child pedagogy attempts to nurture the intellectual, physical, emotional, and social growth of every student.

Fieldston terminated its participation in the Advanced Placement Program in 2002 to give its faculty the freedom to offer more innovative, challenging, and thought-provoking material. Students can take AP exams, but the school no longer officially sponsors such courses.

==Athletics==
Fieldston has 60 junior varsity and varsity athletic teams in the middle and upper schools. Student athletes have won 26 state and 65 league titles since the year 2000. Teams are part of the Ivy Preparatory School League and include:

Fall sports
*Cross country
*Field hockey
*Football
*Soccer
*Girls&#x27; tennis
*Volleyball
*Water polo

Winter sports
*Basketball
*Ice hockey
*Indoor track
*Squash
*Swimming
*Table tennis

Spring sports
*Baseball
*Golf
*Lacrosse
*Softball
*Boys&#x27; tennis
*Track and field
*Ultimate Frisbee

Girls Varsity Volleyball won the 2023 New York State Independent School (NYSAIS) Championship after having an undefeated season with 21 wins.

==Student life==
At the two lower schools and in the middle school, students can participate in a variety of before and after-school programs, including fencing, cooking, golf, robotics, chess, and many sports.

In the Upper and Middle Schools, there are more than 80 student-led clubs, affinity groups, and service-learning organizations.

===Student publications===

&quot;The Fieldston News&quot; is Fieldston Upper&#x27;s student-run newspaper.

&quot;Inklings&quot; is the school&#x27;s literary journal, published and edited by students in the Upper School. It is available only in print at the end of each academic year.

==Peer schools==
Ethical Culture Fieldston is a part of the Ivy Preparatory School League, with many of New York City&#x27;s elite private schools. The three high schools Fieldston, Riverdale, and Horace Mann together are known as the &quot;Hill schools,&quot; as all three (sometimes rivals) are located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, on a hilly area above Van Cortlandt Park.

<doc id="1169368" wikidata="Q843032" url="?curid=1169368" title="Paradise City">
<text>&quot;Paradise City&quot; is a song by the American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, featured on their debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). Released as a single in January 1989, it is the only song on the album to feature a synthesizer. The song peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—becoming the band&#x27;s third single to reach the Top 10—and number six on the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the Irish Singles Chart, their first of three singles to do so.

==Background==
Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; lead guitarist, Slash, states that the song was written in the back of a rental van as they were on their way back from playing a gig in San Francisco with the band Rock N Riders. He says that the band was drinking and playing acoustic guitars, when he came up with the intro. Duff McKagan and Izzy Stradlin started playing along. Slash started humming a melody when Axl Rose sang, &quot;Take me down to the Paradise City.&quot; Slash chimed in with &quot;Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.&quot; Rose sang the first line again, where Slash shouted out &quot;Where the girls are fat and they&#x27;ve got big titties.&quot; Rose finished with &quot;Take ... me ... home!&quot; Slash preferred his second line but the rest of the band felt differently. He was outvoted and they used the first line. The band then expanded upon the rest of the lyrics in rounds. Finally, Slash wrapped up by coming up with the heavy riff that drives the song.

During a 1988 interview, Rose told &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine that &quot;the verses are more about being in the jungle; the chorus is like being back in the Midwest or somewhere.&quot;

In the last two minutes of the song, it changes to double-time and the chorus is repeated several times while Slash plays a guitar solo in the background.

Guitarist Andy McCoy has said that the song is copied from several riffs written by his band, Hanoi Rocks. He has said that the chorus is just a slower version of the riff in &quot;Lost in the City&quot;. Axl Rose has often cited Hanoi Rocks as Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; biggest influence. Hanoi Rocks&#x27; original rhythm guitarist Nasty Suicide can also be seen in the music video for &quot;Paradise City.&quot; The style of the main riff of &quot;Paradise City&quot; (involving an ascending chromatic riff) has also been used by many former Guns N&#x27; Roses members in new projects. This can be seen in Izzy Stradlin&#x27;s &quot;Bomb&quot; and Velvet Revolver&#x27;s &quot;Do It for the Kids&quot;. According to Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns and former member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, the riff was influenced by the Black Sabbath song &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; from the &quot;Born Again&quot; album.

Musically, the song has been described as glam metal, hard rock, and heavy metal.

==Legacy==
The song ranked number 21 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs of All Time&quot;. It ranked number 459 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; Some publications, such as &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;, have identified the song as one of the band&#x27;s worst. The latter designating it as the most overrated in their catalogue, writing &quot;&#x27;Paradise City&#x27; runs out of ideas halfway through its triumphant first refrain and yet still lasts for six more minutes.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number 11 on their list of the 15 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs, and in 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs. The 2008 video game &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot; is set in a fictional location, known as Paradise City, which is named after the song, and the song itself serves as the game&#x27;s introductory and closing credits music.

==Live==
During live Guns N&#x27; Roses shows, &quot;Paradise City&quot; is usually performed last, as an encore. This has been a tradition since at least 1988, up to their latest tour. They also performed the song live at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert in 1992 (this time it was the first song of their short set).

==N-Trance version==
British electronic music group N-Trance recorded a version of &quot;Paradise City&quot; (using the song&#x27;s riff) for their 1998 album, &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. It was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in 1998. In the United Kingdom, it was the group&#x27;s first single to miss the top 20 since &quot;Turn Up the Power&quot; in 1994, peaking at number 28 in September 1998. It reached the top 40 in Australia and Sweden—the group&#x27;s final single to do so in these regions—and peaked at number four in New Zealand, where it charted for nine weeks.

<doc id="1169375" wikidata="Q1637167" url="?curid=1169375" title="Yakov Pavlov">
<text>Yakov Fedotovich Pavlov (; 17 October 191728 September 1981) was a Soviet Red Army soldier who became a Hero of the Soviet Union for his role in defending the eponymous &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot; during the Battle of Stalingrad.

==Early life==
Pavlov was born in 1917 to a peasant family in the small village of Krestovaya in northwestern Russia (present-day Novgorod Oblast).

== Military career ==
Pavlov joined the Red Army in 1938. During World War II, he fought on the Southwestern, Stalingrad, 3rd Ukrainian and 2nd Belorussian fronts. Pavlov was a commander of a machine gun unit, an artilleryman, and a commander of a reconnaissance unit with the rank of senior sergeant.

During the Battle of Stalingrad, on the night of 27 September 1942, Pavlov&#x27;s platoon recaptured a four-story residential building from the German Army, and defended it against continual attack by the Germans until relieved by advancing Soviet forces two months later. Vasily Chuikov, commanding general of the Soviet forces in Stalingrad, claimed that the Germans lost more men trying to take Pavlov&#x27;s House than they did taking Paris.

== Post-war life ==
The building and its defense went down in history as &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot; (&quot;Дом Павлова&quot;). For his actions in Stalingrad, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, the Order of the October Revolution, two Orders of the Red Star and numerous other medals. Post-war, he joined the Communist Party. He was elected three times as Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

== Death ==
Pavlov died on 28 September 1981, most likely due to injuries he received during his military career, and was buried in Novgorod.

<doc id="1169386" wikidata="Q1641089" url="?curid=1169386" title="Multinational state">
<text>A multinational state or a multinational [[political union|union]] is a sovereign entity that comprises two or more nations or states. This contrasts with a nation state, where a single nation accounts for the bulk of the population. Depending on the definition of &quot;nation&quot; (which touches on ethnicity, language, and political identity), a multinational state is usually multicultural or multilingual, and is geographically composed of more than one country, such as the countries of the United Kingdom.

Historical multinational states that have since split into multiple states include the Ottoman Empire, British India, Qing Empire, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic and Austria-Hungary (a dual monarchy of two multinational states). Some analysts have described the European Union as a multinational state or a potential one.

==Definition==

Many attempts have been made to define multinational states. One complicating factor is that it is possible for members of a group that could be considered a nation to identify with more than one nation-state. As Katiambo (2024) explains in &quot;Consumer nationalism in Kenya: tracing the rhetorical construction of the nation through anti-brand activism on Facebook&quot;, many countries are multination states and there are only &quot;few nation-states with a perfect match between the nation and the state.&quot; Ilan Peleg wrote in &quot;Democratizing the Hegemonic State&quot;: 

A state may also be a society, and a multiethnic society has people belonging to more than one ethnic group, in contrast to societies that are ethnically homogeneous. By some definitions of &quot;society&quot; and &quot;homogeneous&quot;, virtually all contemporary national societies are multiethnic. The scholar David Welsh argued in 1993 that fewer than 20 of the 180 sovereign states then in existence were ethnically and nationally homogeneous, if a homogeneous state was defined as one in which minorities made up less than 5 percent of the population. Sujit Choudhry therefore argues that &quot;[t]he age of the agriculturally homogeneous state, if ever there was one, is over&quot;.

== Modern multinational states ==
===Africa===
Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are former colonies and, as such, are not drawn along national lines, making them truly multinational states.

====Ghana====
There is no ethnic majority in Ghana. The plurality group, the Akan people, are a meta-ethnicity (that is, a collection of similar but distinct ethnicities). While Akan is the most-widely spoken language in Ghana, English is the official language of government. 

==== Kenya ====
Kenya is home to more than 70 ethnic groups; the most populous of which are the Kikuyu, at about 20 percent of the population. Together, the five largest groups—the Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kamba, and Kalenjin—account for 70 percent of Kenyans. The major impediment to nation-building in Kenya is the schism caused by the failure to align the mystically bonded ethnic groups to the state so that the state territory can simultaneously be the national territory and vice versa (Katiambo, 2024, p.6). According to Katiambo (2024) although the hegemony of the nation-state should ideally lead to each state having one nation, regardless of Kenya’s deliberate nation-building efforts aimed at reversing the fragmented ethnic nations of the colonial epoch, the nation-state is still in competition with ethnic sub-nationalism. 

==== Nigeria ====
The largest nation in Nigeria is the Hausa-Fulani, which accounts for 29 percent of the country&#x27;s population. However, the group actually encompasses two distinct ethnicities: the Hausa and the Fulani (or Fulbe). While both ethnicities are found in large areas of West Africa, it is only in Nigeria that they are classified as a single ethnic group for political expediency. Nigeria is also made up of many other ethnic groups like the Yoruba, Igbo and Ibibio. Prior to colonialism, they were not self identified as one ethnic nationality but are so today along with the three Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo which classification does carry between each group of who is part of and not part of the group aside from them Nigeria as about 250–500 other ethnic nationalities considered minorities with some large enough to control the outcomes of elections in states such as the Igala and Urhobo. While some are so small that they only show up in one local Government area.

====South Africa====
Present-day South Africa is the successor state to the Union of South Africa, which was formed from four British colonies in 1910.

South Africa has eleven official languages (Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, and Zulu) and formally recognizes several other languages spoken by minority nations. Speakers of each language may be of a different nationality—for example, some members of the Ndebele and Tswana nations speak Zulu, and groups such as the Thembu and Hlubi speak Xhosa.

As is the case throughout Africa, the nations of South Africa mostly correspond to specific regions. However, large cities such as Johannesburg are home to a mixture of national groups, leading to a &quot;melting pot&quot; of cultures. The government has continuously attempted to unify the country&#x27;s various nationalities and to foster a South African identity.

Many of the nationalities found in South Africa are also found in bordering countries, and in some cases, more members live in South Africa than in the country where the group originated. For example, there are more Sotho, Tswana, and Swazi people living in South Africa than in the bordering nation states of Lesotho, Botswana, and Eswatini, respectively. In the past, this has led to conflict. Lesotho still claims large swathes of South Africa, and attempts have been made to cede some South African territory to Botswana and Eswatini. All three states were intended to be incorporated in the Union of South Africa, but those plans never came to fruition because of power struggles within their apartheid governments.

=== Americas ===

==== Bolivia ====
Since 2010, under the presidency of Evo Morales, Bolivia has been officially defined as a plurinational state, which recognizes the national distinctiveness of various indigenous peoples.

==== Canada ====

Whether Canada should be described as &quot;multinational&quot; is an ongoing topic in academia and popular discourse. The current policy of the federal government is that Canada is bilingual—English and French are both official languages—and multicultural. In 2006, the House of Commons of Canada voted in favour of &quot;Government Business No. 11&quot;, which states that the Québécois &quot;form a nation within a united Canada&quot;. According to Canadian political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be seen as a multinational country. All Canadians are members of Canada as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, and this is a community that contains many other kinds within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, and civic (the provincial and municipal governments) sorts, but also national communities, which often include or overlap with many of the other kinds. He thus recognizes the following nations within Canada: those formed by the various First Nations, that of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.

=== Asia ===
==== Afghanistan ====

While Pashto and Dari being Afghanistan&#x27;s two official languages, the nation is separated into several ethnolinguistic groups which the major ones include the Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, and Sadats. Among the minor groups are the Pashayis, Nuristanis, Pamiris, Kurds, Kyrgyz, and several others.

==== Bhutan ====
The four major groups that compose Bhutan&#x27;s ethnic population are the Ngalops, which make up the majority, the Sharchops, the Lhotshampas, and the aboriginal or indigenous tribal peoples living in villages and communities scattered throughout the country. There are also Tibetan refugees that have been around since 1959 during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion.

==== Cambodia ====

While the ethnic Khmer make up 90-94% of Cambodia, others consists of four different major minority groups: the Chams, the indigenous highland Khmer Loeu tribes, the ethnic Chinese, and the ethnic Vietnamese, in addition to other smaller minority groups such as the Khmer Krom.

====China====


The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) is a multinational state consisting of 56 ethnic groups with the Han people the largest ethnic group in mainland China. As of 2010, 91.51% of the population were classified as Han (~1.2 billion). Besides the Han Chinese majority, 55 other ethnic (minority) groups are categorized in present China, numbering approximately 105 million people (8%), mostly concentrated in the bordering northwest, north, northeast, south and southwest but with some in central interior areas.

The major minority ethnic groups in China are Zhuang (16.9 million), Hui (10.5 million), Manchu (10.3 million), Uyghur (10 million), Miao (9.4 million), Yi (8.7 million), Tujia (8.3 million), Tibetan (6.2 million), Mongolian (5.9 million), Dong (2.8 million), Buyei (2.8 million), Yao (2.7 million), Bai (1.9 million), Korean (1.8 million), Hani (1.6 million), Li (1.4 million), Kazakh (1.4 million) and Dai (1.2 million). At least 126,000 people from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China. In addition, there are also unrecognized ethnic groups, for example: Chuanqing people (穿青人), and others, who account for over 730,000 people.

However, the Republic of China (ROC), which ruled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs the island of Taiwan since 1945, had recognized five main ethnic groups under Five Races Under One Union: Han, Hui, Manchu, Mongol and Tibetan. Since retreating to Taiwan, the ROC government recognizes 16 groups of Taiwanese aborigines, which constitutes a number 569,000 or 2.38% of the island&#x27;s population. The PRC classifies them as &quot;Gāoshān&quot;.

====India====

India has more than 2,000 ethnolinguistic groups which includes over 645 indigenous tribes with 52 major tribes among them, and over 80,000 subcultures, and every major religion is represented being Hinduism, Islam, Adivasi, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Christianity as are four major language families (Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Sino-Tibetan) and a language isolate (Nihali).

Each state and union territory of India has one or more official languages, and the Constitution of India recognizes in particular 22 &quot;scheduled languages&quot;. It also recognizes 212 scheduled tribal groups, which together constitute about 7.5% of the country&#x27;s population.

Most of its states are based on a linguistic ethnicity, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh (Hindustanis), Gujarat (Gujaratis), West Bengal (Bengalis), Maharashtra (Marathis), Odisha (Odias), Goa (Konkanis), Haryana (Haryanvis), Rajasthan (Rajasthanis), Punjab (Punjabis), Tamil Nadu (Tamils), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (Telugus), Karnataka (Kannada), Kerala (Malayalis), Assam (Assamese), Nagaland (Nagas), Manipur (Manipuris), Mizoram (Mizos), Meghalaya (Khasi), Tripura (Tripuri), and Sikkim (Sikkimese). Jammu and Kashmir is the only union territory in the country based on this which is home to the Kashmiris, Dogras, Ladakhis, Gujjars, Bakarwals, Paharis, Dards, Hanjis, and several other people groups.

Furthermore, several other Indian states are themselves ethnically, linguistically, and religiously diverse. The tribes of Uttar Pradesh are Agarias, Baigas, Bhars, Cheros, Gonds, Kolis, Korwas, Tharus, Bhoksas, Bhotiyas, Jaunsaris, and Rajis; Madhya Pradesh is where tribes such as the Gonds, Bhils, Baiga, Korku, Bhadia, Halba, Kaul, Mariya, Malto and Sahariya; Chhattisgarh&#x27;s tribal population consists mainly of the Gonds, Kanwars, Brinjhwasr, Bhaina, Bhatra, Uraon, Oraons, Kamar, Halba, Baiga, Sanwras, Korwas, Bhariatis, Nageshias, Manghwars, Kharias, and Dhanwars; Bihar has the Bhojpuris, Maithils, and Magadhis, and Jharkhand has the Santhals, Oraons, Mundas, Kharias, and Hos while both states are home to several other groups like the Hindustani-speaking peoples; Uttarakhand is where the Garhwalis, Kumaonis, and tribes like the Jaunsaris, Bhotiyas, Tharus, Bhoksas, Rajis, and Banrawats resides; Karnataka houses the Kannadigas, Tuluvas, and several others; Himachal Pradesh is home to tribes like the Kinnauris, Gujjars, Lahaulis, Gaddis, Swanglas, Pangwalis, Khampas, and others; Arunachal Pradesh being the home of various tribes like the Abor, Hruso, Apatanis, Nyishis, Tagins, Galos, Khamptis, Mishmis, Monpa, any Naga tribes, Sherdukpens, and Singpho; the Assam includes the Assamese, Bodo, and Karbi peoples.

====Indonesia====
Indonesia is a very diverse country with over 600 ethnic groups. The vast majority of them speak Austronesian languages and among these tribal people groups are the Javanese, Sundanese, Malays, Madurese, Bugis, Torajans, Bataks, Mandarese, Minangkabau, Betawi, Banjarese, Acehnese, Balinese, Dayaks, Sasaks, Cirebonese, Lampungese, Palembang, Gorontaloa, Minahasan, Nias, and Makassarese. Another group of indigenous peoples in the country are the native Melanesians in the Maluku Islands and Western New Guinea, which include tribes such as the Ambonese, native Timorese peoples, Biak, Dani, Moi, Arfak, Amungme, Asmat, and Korowai, among others. Non-indigenous peoples includes Indos (half-Dutch, half-native Indonesians), Mardijkers, ethnic Chinese and Peranakans, Arabs, and Indians.

The largest ethnicity in Indonesia is the Javanese which makes up 40% of the population and most of them live indigenously in Java island, the most populous island in the country. Generally, people who live outside of Jakarta still retain the ethnic language and utilize it in daily conversations. As a result, formation of distinct dialects each unique to the regions, is prominently used among the population.

==== Laos ====

The government of Laos recognizes over 160 ethnic groups with 49 main ethnicities. These main Laotian ethnic groups separated into 4 linguistic groups which are 8 Lao-Tai peoples which includes the ethnic Lao who make up the majority in the country, 32 Mon-Khmer peoples, 7 Tibeto-Burmese peoples, and 2 Hmong-Loumien peoples. They are generally spread across the nation each with their own distinct traditions, cultures and languages.

====Malaysia====
When it was formed on 16 September 1963, Malaysia comprised four independent, self-governing nations: Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak. In 1965, Singapore seceded from the federation. Today, Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak each have their own ethnic majority. Generally, however, Malaysia is considered to have three major groups: Bumiputeras (Malays, Orang Asli, various native tribes of the Borneo states, and Peranakans), ethnic Chinese, and ethnic Indians. While the Malays make up the majority of population in the country, the Ibans for Sarawak and the Kadazan-Dusun, Murut, and Sama-Bajau peoples for Sabah are dominant in their respective states. Malay is the primary official and national language, followed by English. In Sabah and Sarawak, English is the official language, although many locals speak a dialect of Malay.

====Myanmar====
Myanmar (also known as Burma) is an ethnically diverse nation with 135 distinct ethnic groups officially recognized by the Burmese Government. These are grouped into eight &quot;major national ethnic races&quot;: Bamar, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Mon, Rakhine, Shan

The &quot;major national ethnic races&quot; are grouped primarily according to region rather than linguistic or ethnic affiliation, as for example the Shan Major National Ethnic Race includes 33 ethnic groups speaking languages in at least four widely differing language families.

Many unrecognized ethnic groups exist, the largest being the Burmese Chinese and Panthay (who together form 3% of the population), Burmese Indians (who form 2% of the population), Rohingya, Anglo-Burmese and Gurkha.

==== Nepal ====
Nepal is a multi-ethnic country with over 100 ethnic groups. Most ethnic groups fall into one of two categories and either speak Indo-Aryan languages or Sino-Tibetan languages. The official language of the country is Nepali, earlier known as Gorkhali in the Kingdom of Nepal, which is part of the Indo-Aryan group and is the spoken by majority of the population. 

The Indo-Aryan languages languages are spoken by Madhesi people ( Maithili, Bhojpuri, Awadhi) and Tharu ethnic groups which constitutes majority of the speakers in southern Nepal in the Terai region. The people who speak Sino-Tibetan languages includes Tamang, Newari, Magar, Gurung, Kiranti and Sherpa ethnic groups in central and northern Nepal. Much of the ethnic groups migrated from neighbouring countries over the centuries from India and Tibet.

====Pakistan====
Pakistan&#x27;s population comprises various ethnolinguistic groups; the major groups are the Punjabis, Pashtuns, Sindhis, Saraikis, Balochs, Brahuis, Paharis, and Muhajirs. Minor groups includes the Kashmiris, Chitralis, Shina, Baltis, Kohistanis, Torwalis, Hazaras, Burusho, Wakhis, Kalash, Siddis, Uzbeks, Nuristanis, Pamiris, Hazarewals and several other minorities.

Present-day Pakistan arose out of the Pakistan Movement, which demanded a separate state for the Muslims of the British Raj. The movement was based on the two-nation theory put forward by Muhammad Ali Jinnah: the idea that Hindus and Muslims in British India represented not only different religious communities but also distinct nations, and hence that, in the event of Indian independence, they should be divided into two nation states. Jinnah (known in Pakistan as &quot;Quaid-e-Azam&quot;, meaning &quot;the great leader&quot;) outlined the theory as follows:

This movement culminated in the creation of Pakistan in 1947 through the partition of India. Urdu was then promoted as the national language of all South Asian Muslims. However, Pakistan remains ethnically diverse. Punjabis are the largest ethnolinguistic group, but at 45 percent of the population, they do not make up an absolute majority. Furthermore, only 8 percent of Pakistanis speak the national language, Urdu, as their mother tongue. As a result, many nationalist movements that oppose the two-nation theory have emerged, arguing that Pakistan is not only a linguistically diverse state but also a multinational one, and that, therefore, each ethnolinguistic group of Pakistan is a distinct nation. Common grievances of these movements include the idea that Punjabis dominate Pakistan politically and economically, thus marginalizing other groups, and that the establishment of Urdu as the country&#x27;s sole official language is a form of cultural imperialism that ignores the heritage of Pakistan&#x27;s diverse peoples.

The most successful of these movements was Bengali nationalism, which led to the creation of the Bengali-speaking nation-state of Bangladesh. The movement asserted that Urdu&#x27;s official status gave an unfair advantage to Muhajirs (most of whom speak Urdu as their mother tongue) and Punjabis (whose mother tongue, Punjabi, is similar to Urdu, and many of whom were educated in Urdu under British rule). Bengalis feared they would be marginalized despite their demographic strength as, at the time, the largest ethnic group of Pakistan. These grievances culminated in the secession of East Bengal (which had been part of the administrative unit of East Pakistan) and the creation of Bangladesh.

Today, nationalist movements within Pakistan include those of the Sindhis, Pashtuns, Balochs, Mohajirs, and Kashmiris. The members of these movements assert that Islam cannot be considered the sole basis for nationhood, and that Pakistan is therefore a multinational state. Their demands range from increased autonomy or the transformation of Pakistan into a federation, to the recognition of language rights for non-Urdu-speaking populations, to outright secession.

Despite the fact that Punjabis are widely seen as the dominant ethnic group in Pakistan, both economically and politically, there is also a small Punjabi movement that asserts that the Punjabi language has been unfairly subordinated to Urdu and supports the reestablishment of cultural and economic links with East Punjab in India.

====Philippines====
The Philippines has more than 182 distinct ethnolinguistic groups that the vast majority of them speaking Austronesian languages, with the Tagalogs, Bisayans, Ilocanos, Bikols, Kapampangans, Pangasinans, Ivatans, Romblomanons, Masbateños, Kamayos, Moros, Igorots, Lumads, Mangyans, and Zamboangueños being the most prevalent. Among the immigrants and mixed peoples are the Spanish Filipinos, Chinese Filipinos, Japanese Filipinos, Mestizo de Españols, Mestizo de Sangleys, Tornatrás, Indian Filipinos, Sangils, Jewish Filipinos, and American Filipinos.

==== Thailand ====

There are some 70 ethnic groups in Thailand which make up 24 ethnolinguistically Tai peoples such as the Central Thais, Isan, and Northern Thais, 22 Austroasiatic peoples, with significant populations of Northern Khmer and Kuy, 11 Sino-Tibetan-speaking hill tribes, 3 Austronesian peoples being Malays, Moken, and Urak Lawoi. Immigrants in the nation includes communities like the Chinese, Indians, and Thai Portuguese. However, the Royal Thai Government officially recognizes only 62 of these ethnolinguistic groups.

====Vietnam====

The Vietnamese government recognizes 54 ethnic groups, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), ethnic Vietnamese account for 85.32% of the nation&#x27;s population and the non-Vietnamese ethnic groups account for the remaining percent. The ethnic Vietnamese inhabit a little less than half of Vietnam, while the ethnic minorities inhabit the majority of Vietnam&#x27;s land (albeit the least fertile parts of the country).

The central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) consist of two main ethnolinguistic types--Malayo-Polynesian and Mon–Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.

Other minority groups include the Chams—remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese through a progress called &quot;Nam Tiến&quot;, Hmong, Chinese, and Thái.

=== Europe ===

Montenegro is the only European state with no ethnic majority, but many others have ethnic minorities that form a majority within a province or region (see multilingual countries and regions of Europe).

==== Russia ====

Russia is a multinational state, and is home to over 193 ethnic groups. In the 2010 Census, roughly 81% of the population were ethnic Russians, and 19% of the population were minorities; while around 84.93% of the Russia&#x27;s population was of European descent, of which the vast majority were Slavs as well as minorities of Germanic, Baltic-Finns and other peoples. There are 22 republics in Russia, designated to have their own ethnicities, cultures, and languages. In 13 of them, ethnic Russians consist a minority. According to the United Nations, Russia&#x27;s immigrant population is the third-largest in the world, numbering over 11.6 million; most of which are from post-Soviet states, mainly Ukrainians. The republics are Tatarstan (Volga Tatars), Bashkortostan (Bashkirs, Volga Tatars), Chuvashia (Chuvash), Adygea (Adyghe), Karachay-Cherkessia (Cherkess of Karachay-Cherkessia, Karachays, Nogais, Abaza), Kabardino-Balkaria (Kabardins &amp; Balkars), Chechnya (Chechens), Mordovia (Mordvin), Udmurtia (Udmurts), Mari El (Mari), Kalmykia (Kalmyks), the Komi Republic (Komi), Karelia (Karelians, ethnic Finns, Vepsians), Ingushetia (Ingushs), North Ossetia-Alania (Ossetians), Sakha (Yakuts, Evenki, Evens, Dolgans, Yukaghir), Buryatia (Buryats), Khakassia (Khakas), the Altai Republic (Altai, ethnic Kazakhs), Tuva (Tuvans), and Dagestan (ethnic Azerbaijanis, Chechens, Avars, Dargins, Kumyks, Lezgins, Laks, Tabasarans, Nogais, Aguls, Rutuls, Tsakhurs, Tats and others). There are also 4 autonomous okrugs which are Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (Khanty &amp; Mansi), Nenets Autonomous Okrug (Nenets), Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (Nenets, Selkup), and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug (Chukchi), 1 autonomous oblast, it is Jewish autonomous oblast (Jews, but there are a few of them, because of migration to Israel after dissolution of the Soviet Union), 6 administrative-territorial units with a special status, which are Agin-Buryat Okrug (Buryats) in Zabaykalsky Krai, Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (Buryats) in Irkutsk Oblast, Koryak Okrug (Koryaks) in Kamchatka Krai, Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District (Dolgans, Nenets, Enets, Nganasans) and Evenkiysky District (Evenki) in Krasnoyarsky Krai, Komi-Permyak Okrug (Komi) in Perm Krai. 

The Tatars, Bashkirs, and Chechens are three predominantly Muslim minorities in the country. Russia is also home to small Buddhist populations, such as the nomadic Buryats in Buryatia, and the Kalmyks; native to Kalmykia, the only Buddhist region in Europe. There are also the Shamanistic peoples of Siberia and the Far North; the Finno-Ugric peoples of Northwest Russia and the Volga region; the Korean inhabitants of Sakhalin; and the diverse peoples of the North Caucasus.

Russia&#x27;s official language is Russian. However, Russia&#x27;s 193 minority ethnic groups speak over 100 languages. According to the 2002 Census, 142.6 million people speak Russian, followed by Tatar with 5.3 million, and Ukrainian with 1.8 million speakers. The constitution gives the individual republics of the country the right to establish their own state languages in addition to Russian.

==== Belgium ====
The territory of Belgium is almost equally divided between the two people groups and their communities: the Dutch-speaking Flemings of Flanders and the French-speaking Walloons of Wallonia. This led to political unrest throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and in the aftermath of the difficult 2007–08 Belgian government formation, the Belgian media envisaged a partition of Belgium as a potential solution. There is also a German-speaking minority in the east.

==== Bosnia and Herzegovina ====
Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic &quot;constituent peoples&quot;: Bosniaks (50.11%), Serbs (30.78%), and Croats (15.43%). The country&#x27;s political divisions were created by the Dayton Agreement, which recognized a second tier of government comprising two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (mostly Bosniaks and Croats) and the Republika Srpska (mostly Serbs), with each governing roughly half of the state&#x27;s territory. A third region, the Brčko District, was governed locally. Today, all three ethnic groups have an equal constitutional status over the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country has a bicameral legislature and a three-member presidency composed of one member of each major ethnic group.

==== Norway ====
Official policy states that Norway was founded on the territory of two peoples, Norwegians and Samis. In addition, Forest Finns, Kvens, Jews, Romani, and the Norwegian and Swedish Travellers are recognised as national minorities.

==== Spain ====


Definitions of ethnicity and nationality in Spain are politically fraught, particularly since the transition from Francoist Spain to the (restored) Kingdom of Spain in the 1970s, when local regionalisms and peripheral nationalisms became a major part of national politics.

The term Spanish people (Spanish: &quot;pueblo español&quot;) is defined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 as the political sovereign, i.e., the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution, in its preamble, speaks of &quot;peoples and nationalities of Spain&quot; (&quot;pueblos y nacionalidades de España&quot;) and their respective cultures, traditions, languages, and institutions.

The &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; (2011) describes Spain&#x27;s ethnic makeup as a &quot;composite of Mediterranean and Nordic types&quot;, instead of the usual breakdown of ethnic composition. This reflects the formation of the modern Kingdom of Spain by the accretion of numerous independent Iberian realms: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Castile, Catalonia, Galicia, León, Majorca, Navarre, and Valencia. Thus, today&#x27;s Spaniards include Andalusians, Aragonese, Asturians, Basques, Cantabrians, Castilians, Catalans, Galicians, Leonese, and Valencians, and individual members of these groups may or may not consider them distinct nations.

==== United Kingdom ====
While the Office for National Statistics describes the United Kingdom as a nation state, other people, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, describe it as a multinational state. The term &quot;Home Nations&quot; is used to describe the national teams that represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in various sports.

The Kingdom of Great Britain was created on 1 May 1707 by the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland. This unification was the result of the Treaty of Union, which was agreed on 22 July 1706 and then ratified by the parliaments of England and Scotland in the 1707 Acts of Union. The two kingdoms, along with the Kingdom of Ireland, had already been in a personal union as a result of the 1603 Union of the Crowns, in which James VI, King of Scots, inherited the Kingdoms of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London. However, until 1707, all three had remained separate political entities with separate political institutions.

Prior to the Acts of Union, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland both had minority populations of their own that could themselves be called nations. Wales and Cornwall were part of the Kingdom of England (Wales had been officially incorporated into England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, although it had been a &quot;de facto&quot; English territory since the 13th century; Cornwall had been conquered during the Anglo-Saxon period). The Northern Isles, with their Norse-derived culture, were part of Scotland, having been pledged by Norway as security against the payment of a dowry for Margaret of Denmark and then integrated in 1471. When the Kingdom of Great Britain was created, many of its inhabitants retained a sense of English, Scottish, or Welsh identity. Many of them also spoke languages other than English: principally Scottish Gaelic, Scots, Welsh, Cornish, and Norn.

Almost a century later, the Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the 1800 Acts of Union. The United Kingdom thus became the union of the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland. Eventually, disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish home rule led to the partition of the island: The Irish Free State received dominion status in 1922, while Northern Ireland remained part of the UK. As a result, in 1927, the formal title of the UK was changed to its current form, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Political, ethnic, and religious tensions between Irish and British groups in Northern Ireland culminated in The Troubles. This period of armed conflict erupted in 1966 between loyalist paramilitaries, seeking to maintain the country&#x27;s position in the UK, and republican paramilitaries, seeking to unify Ireland as a 32-county independent republic. The British Army also played a key role. Following the deaths of over 3,500 people, a peace treaty was reached in 1998, although divisions remain high in some areas and sporadic violence still occurs.

The end of the 20th century brought major governing changes, with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums.

The Scottish National Party, the largest political party in Scotland, is committed to the goal of an independent Scotland within the European Union, but this is opposed by three of the four other parties in the Scottish Parliament. A referendum on Scottish independence was held in September 2014, and 55% of the electorate rejected independence in favour of retaining the union. Plaid Cymru, a Welsh nationalist party, has a similar ambition for Wales. Plaid Cymru is currently the second- or third-largest party in Wales depending on how it is measured. Several parties in Northern Ireland, including the second- and third-largest, seek to establish an independent United Ireland, and have repeatedly called for border polls. The d&#x27;Hondt system used in Northern Ireland means that either the First Minister or Deputy First Minister will be from one of these parties.

== Former multinational states ==

=== Roman Empire ===
Early Romans assimilated neighbouring tribes in the Italian peninsula, including Etruscans and the Greeks of Magna Graecia. The rights of Roman citizenship extended to the Italic peoples from the 1st century BCE, and later more widely: Gauls, Iberians, Greeks, and the peoples of North Africa and of the Near East joined with Britons and Teutons in a multi-ethnic conglomeration, often headed by &quot;provincial&quot; emperors of non-Roman ethnic stock. The success of the Roman state in melding together various nations into a single putative whole shows in the nature and naming of its successor states: the Byzantine Empire officially styled itself as a &quot;Roman Empire&quot; (historians designate it the &quot;Eastern Roman Empire&quot;), and the Holy Roman Empire (the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot;) maintained pretensions to control various nationalities in Central Europe from 800 to 1806.

===Qing dynasty===
The Qing dynasty was an imperial dynasty that ruled China between 1636 and 1912; it was founded by Manchu people, not by Han Chinese. The Manchu-led dynasty exerted minoritarian rule over the majority-Han Chinese population, and in the 17th and 18th centuries incorporated the regions of present-day Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang into the empire through military expansionism. This effectively made China a multi-ethnic empire, with different regions having varying degrees of autonomy under Qing rule.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===

=== Austria-Hungary ===
Austria-Hungary, which succeeded the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, was a historical monarchy composed by two multinational states. The centrifugal forces within it, coupled with its loss in World War I, led to its breakup in 1918. Its successor states de jure included the First Austrian Republic, the Kingdom of Hungary, while part from her former territories entirely new states were created such as Czechoslovakia, or other parts incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Poland, Kingdom of Romania, Kingdom of Italy and the Soviet Union.

The principal languages of Austria-Hungary were German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Croatian, but there were also many minor languages, including Ukrainian, Romanian, Slovak, Serbian, Slovene, Rusyn, Italian, and Yiddish.

===Ottoman Empire===
The Ottoman Empire was the dynastic state of the Turkish House of Osman. At its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, it controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa.

In addition to Turks, the ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire included Albanians, Amazighs, Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Circassians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Kurds, Laz, Macedonians, Romanians, Serbs, Tatars, and Zazas.

Through millet courts, confessional communities were allowed to rule themselves under their own legal systems: for example, sharia law for Muslims, Canon law for Christians, and halakha law for Jews. After the Tanzimat reforms from 1839 to 1876, the term &quot;millet&quot; was used to refer to legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word &quot;nation&quot;. (The word &quot;millet&quot; comes from the Arabic word &quot;millah&quot; (ملة), which literally means &quot;nation&quot;.) The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern religious pluralism.

===Soviet Union===

The Soviet Union was a state composed of the Soviet republics (of which there were 15 after 1956), with the capital in Moscow. It was founded in December 1922, when the Russian SFSR—which formed during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and emerged victorious in the ensuing Russian Civil War—unified with the Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian SSRs. Addressing the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union on 25 November 1936, Joseph Stalin stated that &quot;within the Soviet Union there are about sixty nations, national groups, and nationalities. The Soviet state is a multinational state.&quot; Among the 15 republics were the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were illegally annexed into the Soviet Union in 1940. The Soviet occupation of the Baltic states was not recognized by a number of Western governments including the United States.

In the late 1980s, some of the republics sought sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR Constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for secession in a referendum. Many held free elections, and the resulting legislatures soon passed bills that contradicted Soviet laws, in what became known as the War of Laws.

In 1989, the Russian SFSR—the largest constituent republic, with about half of the USSR&#x27;s population—convened a new Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and elected Boris Yeltsin its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass legislation that attempted to supersede Soviet laws. Legal uncertainty continued through 1991 as constituent republics slowly gained &quot;de facto&quot; independence.

In a referendum on 17 March 1991, majorities in nine of the 15 republics voted to preserve the Union. The referendum gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a minor boost, and in the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty was designed and agreed upon by eight republics. The treaty would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser federation, but its signing was interrupted by the August Coup—an attempted coup d&#x27;état against Gorbachev by hardline Communist Party members of the government and the KGB, who sought to reverse Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms and reassert the central government&#x27;s control over the republics. When the coup collapsed, Yeltsin—who had publicly opposed it—came out as a hero, while Gorbachev&#x27;s power was effectively ended.

As a result, the balance of power tipped significantly toward the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia had regained their independence (following Lithuania&#x27;s 1990 example), while the other twelve republics continued to discuss new, increasingly loose models for the Union.

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. Doubts remained about the authority of the Belavezha Accords to dissolve the Union, but on 21 December 1991, representatives of every Soviet republic except Georgia—including those that had signed the Belavezha Accords—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the dissolution of the USSR and reiterated the establishment of the CIS. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev yielded, resigning as the president of the USSR and declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers vested in the Soviet presidency over to Yeltsin, the president of Russia.

The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, dissolved itself. Many organizations, such as the Soviet Army and police forces, remained in place in the early months of 1992, but were slowly phased out and either withdrawn from or absorbed by the newly independent states.

=== Yugoslavia ===

The first country to be known by this name was the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, known until 3 October 1929 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was established on 1 December 1918 by the union of the State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia (to which the Kingdom of Montenegro had been annexed on 13 November 1918), and the Conference of Ambassadors gave international recognition to the union on 13 July 1922.

The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers in 1941 and abolished as a result of World War II. It was succeeded by Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, proclaimed in 1943 by the Yugoslav Partisans resistance movement. When a communist government was established in 1946, the country was renamed the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1963, it was renamed again, becoming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). This was the largest Yugoslav state, with Istria and Rijeka having been added after World War II.

The country consisted of six constituent &quot;socialist republics&quot; (SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Slovenia, and SR Serbia) and two &quot;socialist autonomous provinces&quot; (SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo, which became largely equal to other members of the federation after 1974).

Starting in 1991, the SFRY disintegrated in the Yugoslav Wars, which followed the secession of most of the country&#x27;s constituent entities. The next Yugoslavia, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, existed until 2003, when it was renamed Serbia and Montenegro. In 2006, this last vestige separated into Serbia and Montenegro, but only to go further in 2008 after Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence but with limited recognition.

===Czechoslovakia===
Czechoslovakia was a multi-ethnic state, with Czechs and Slovaks as &quot;constituent peoples&quot;. Sudeten Germans were forcibly expelled after World War II.

<text>Quintus Veranius (died 57) was a Roman general around the mid-first century CE. He was &quot;III vir monetalis&quot;, tribune of Legio IV &quot;Scythica&quot; and quaestor under Tiberius. He was appointed tribune of the plebs in 41 and praetor in 42. In 43, the Emperor Claudius constituted the new province of Lycia, and appointed Veranius as its governor. He governed the province until 48, and during this period put down the rebellion of Cilicia Trachea. He served as consul in 49, and was elevated to patrician status by Claudius, who also appointed him as an augur.

Veranius became governor of Britain in 57, replacing Aulus Didius Gallus. He reversed Didius&#x27;s policy of maintaining existing borders and began military operations against the troublesome Silures in what is now Wales, but died within a year. In his will he flattered Nero and claimed that, had he had another two years, he would have conquered the whole of the island. He was replaced by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, and the speed with which Suetonius took Wales suggests that Veranius had already done much of the work. Onasander, a Greek philosopher, dedicated his &quot;Strategikos&quot;, a treatise on generalship, to Veranius, at some point between his consulship (49) and death (57/58).

<text>José Domingo de la Merced de La Mar y Cortázar (Cuenca (Ecuador),12 May 1776 – San José (Costa Rica), 11 October 1830) was a Peruvian military leader and politician who served as the third President of Peru.

==Biography==
===Youth===
La Mar was born on 12 May 1776, at Cuenca in what today is Ecuador. As son of Marcos de La Mar y Migura (1736–1794) and his wife Josefa Paula Cortázar y Lavayen (1748–1815), he spent his early childhood in Spain.

===Military career in Spain, France and Peru (1794–1820)===
With the help of his influential uncle, La Mar entered the Spanish army as a second lieutenant of the regiment of Savoy. In 1794 he participated in the campaign of Roussillon against the French Republic, fighting under the command of the Count of the Union, after which he was promoted to captain (1795). Then he participated in various military actions against revolutionary France, and was already a lieutenant-colonel by the start of Spain&#x27;s national war against Napoleon&#x27;s invasion (1808). He participated in the defense of Zaragoza under command of Colonel Palafox (1808–1809). He was seriously injured, and although that city finally capitulated, earned the title of &quot;Hero of the Nation&quot; (&quot;Benemérito de la Patria en grado heroico&quot;) and was promoted to colonel .

In 1812 he transferred to the front of Valencia, led by General Joaquín Blake, and sent a column of 4,000 veterans grenadiers (the &quot;column La Mar&quot;). Again he was wounded, and was taken to hospital in Tudela, where he was captured by the French. As soon as he was recovered, he was taken to France and confined in the castle of Semur-en-Auxois (Burgundy), where he studied the classics of French culture. After a time, he managed to escape, accompanied by Brigadier Juan María Muñoz y Manito, crossed into Switzerland and then Tyrol and reached the port of Trieste, on the Adriatic Sea, where he sailed back to Spain.

In 1815, Ferdinand VII promoted him to Brigadier, awarded him the Saint Hermenegildo&#x27;s Cross and appointed him Sub-Inspector of the Viceroyalty of Peru, with the title of Governor of Callao. He arrived at the city in 1816. In 1819, he was promoted to Mariscal de campo.

===The War of Independence (1821–1825)===
;The Royalist Cause
During the early days of the Peruvian War of Independence, he remained loyal to the King, and defended the Real Felipe Fortress in Callao, the main port of the Viceroyalty, for the Royalists. He repelled a naval attack by the Patriots under command of Thomas Cochrane in March 1819 and again in September 1819 and October 1820. 

In 1821, rebel troops advanced towards Lima and Viceroy José de la Serna abandoned the capital on 6 June 1821, leaving De la Mar with explicit orders to resist and wait for reinforcements. He successfully withstood all attempts to capture the fort for nearly 4 months. A Royalist relief army, under command of General José Canterac was not able to break the siege or to ship supplies and troops into the fortress, and retreated into the mountains. On 19 September, La Mar and his garrison were forced to surrender, due to the lack of supplies. Only two days later, La Mar finally submitted his left foot to amputation, having initially refused treatment of a gangrenous toe.

;The Rebel Cause
After the Baquijano Capitulation at Callao, La Mar joined forces with the rebel cause. José de San Martín awarded him with the title of &quot;Division General&quot;, a title he accepted reluctantly. In March 1822, he was made a Grand Marshal of Peru

La Mar served as one of three men on the Supreme Governing Junta of the Republic of Peru from 22 September 1822 to 27 February 1823. 
He made strenuous efforts to obtain financing for an expedition to take the southern ports of Peru. Under the command of General Rudecindo Alvarado, an army marched south, but was completely defeated at the Battles of Torata and Moquegua. The Royalist general José Canterac, seeing the city of Lima defenseless, descended from the central mountains and occupied the Peruvian capital easily. 
The resounding failure of the expedition dented the trust that Peruvian politicians had placed in La Mar. Congress, at the insistence of the Peruvian army, dissolved the Supreme Government Board and relieved the triumvirate of all its political responsibilities.
La Mar served as the President of the Congress from November 1823 to December 1823.

La Mar resumed his military functions with the arrival of Simón Bolívar in Peru, who commissioned him to form and train new troops in Trujillo (1824). Having completed the assignment successfully, Bolívar entrusted La Mar with command of the Peruvian Division of the Liberation Army.

Bolívar ordered the final attack on the Royalist troops and led the Patriot armies to the mountains of Peru. Both armies met on the pampas of Junín (6 August 1824), and La Mar had a decisive role in leading the attack that gave victory to the Patriot side in the Battle of Junín. He played the same role in the Battle of Ayacucho (9 December 1924), since it was his directives that inflicted the final defeat on the Spanish and the achievement of Peru&#x27;s independence.

===Independent Peru===

With the Royalist troops removed from the former Peruvian viceroyalty, Bolívar created the Government Junta (1825), which was to replace him in his functions for the leadership of the State, while he traveled to Colombia. José de La Mar was appointed, along with José Faustino Sánchez Carrión and Hipólito Unanue, as one of three men in charge of directing the government. La Mar was president of said board only between 5 January and 25 February 1826, since his serious health condition prevented him from continuing in the direction of Peruvian politics. With medical leave, La Mar immediately retired to Guayaquil in search of a calm and peaceful environment.

La Mar returned as the Constitutional President of the Republic of Peru from 22 August 1827 to 7 June 1829.
During the two years that his presidency lasted, La Mar had to face several uprisings, conspiracies and two armed conflicts: one with the new Republic of Bolivia and one with Gran Colombia. 

He was removed from the Presidency of Peru after less than two years by a coup d&#x27;état led by General Agustín Gamarra and died in forced exile in Costa Rica, on 11 October 1830.

<doc id="1169398" wikidata="Q1093640" url="?curid=1169398" title="Double Tap (film)">
<text>Double Tap (鎗王) is a 2000 Hong Kong action-thriller film directed by Bruce Law, and starring Leslie Cheung, Alex Fong, Monica Chan and Ruby Wong. It was hailed as one of Leslie Cheung&#x27;s most memorable action films since &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. The film was followed by two sequels, &quot;One Nite in Mongkok&quot;, released in 2004, and &quot;Triple Tap&quot;, released in 2010, both of which was directed by Derek Yee and features Fong reprising his role as Inspector Miu.

==Synopsis==
Leslie Cheung plays Rick Pang, a shooting champion who is also a gun expert who tinkers with his pistols and modified its magazine to perfect his double tap technique of placing two shots in the same exact spot to maximize marksmanship in any competition.

In a shooting competition, he goes up against another experienced top cop who is just as comfortable on the pistols as Rick, named Miu. Unfortunately, the competition was marred by a depressed day trader, a friend of Miu, who lost much in the stock market and threatened the safety of the contest, wounding the shooting supervisor, another of Miu&#x27;s friends. Rick was forced to kill him with his trademark double tap as the former approaches Colleen (Rick&#x27;s girlfriend) and Vincent. Miu took note of this astounding technique in the post-mortem while Rick&#x27;s experience from this encounter was strangely exciting to him and he discovers his lust for murdering others in cold blood.

As further murders were committed by an unknown gunman with the similar double tap technique, the list of possible candidates by the police was narrowed down to just a few candidates but Miu was utterly convinced that Rick was also behind all those heinous crimes and hauls him up for investigation. Although Rick was released after an interrogation (having had no solid evidence incriminating him), Miu continued to pursue him and pressurise Rick to an extent that the murderer was suddenly possessed by rage and decided to take the law in his own hands. Rick went to his favorite shooting range and lay in wait for his pursuers. Arming himself with live rounds for his modified pistol, he engaged in a fierce gunfight with the cops and escaped at the first possible opportunity.

It later transpired that Rick was indeed haunted by his earlier murder at the competition but his insatiated lust for murder was further fuelled by his obsession with the double tap technique as he sought to perfect it. Further, he has inadvertently discovered a new use for his pistols: to kill those who opposed him and those who pushed him to the brink.

<text>The Utah &amp; Northern Railway is a defunct railroad that was operated in the Utah Territory and later in the Idaho Territory and Montana Territory in the western United States during the 1870s and 1880s. It was the first railroad in Idaho and in Montana. The line was acquired by a Union Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the Oregon Short Line, and is today operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as the Ogden Subdivision (Ogden to McCammon, Idaho), part of the Pocatello Subdivision (McCammon to Pocatello, Idaho), and the Montana Subdivision (Pocatello to Butte, Montana).

The original of the Utah Northern Railroad (later named Utah &amp; Northern Railway) was conceived and built by the Mormons. It was a narrow gauge spur off the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. The labor for this railroad was largely volunteer Mormon labor as the intent of the railroad was to serve the Mormon communities in the Cache Valley that had been settled almost entirely by the Mormons. It was a case of Mormons forming a company and building their own railroad because existing railroad companies showed no interest in building such a railroad. The northern half of the Cache Valley is in Idaho and, due to claims and disputes by the Shoshone and Bannock Indians, was not settled by the Mormons until after the Bear River Massacre and subsequent Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 that forced the Shoshone and Bannock onto reservations. The original Mormon plan for the Utah Northern was to build a railroad to the communities in the Cache Valley and about into Idaho to Soda Springs, Idaho, that lies in a valley beyond called the Bear River Valley. This was by dictate of Brigham Young as he owned land in Soda Springs and believed that the Bear River Valley had potential for further Mormon settlement. The Mormons also believed they could break the monopoly that the anti-Mormon town of Corinne, Utah, had on the wagon freight business on the Montana Trail by extending the railroad into Idaho. There were tentative plans to eventually extend the Utah Northern to Montana. The road was constructed northward from the Union Pacific line at Ogden commencing construction on August 24, 1871. In three years, the largely volunteer railroad company had built of road. It reached Franklin, Idaho, across the Idaho border, in May 1874 where construction was halted. Investors had become hesitant after the panic of 1873 and the railroad was now moving into the northern half of the Cache Valley where there were fewer Mormon volunteers due to this area only recently having been relinquished by the Bannock and Shoshone. Poor decisions by the planners and the lack of business from the frugal residents of the Cache Valley led to the bankruptcy and foreclosure sale of the Utah Northern only a few years later in 1878.
Robber baron Jay Gould transformed the Utah Northern. He and Union Pacific acquired the Utah Northern Railroad, changing the name to the Utah &amp; Northern Railway and infused the railroad with capital. Big business knew that an electrical age was coming and that the demand for copper products was putting pressure on copper prices. They knew that there were rich copper deposits at the mines near Butte, Montana. Union Pacific quickly resumed construction on the Utah &amp; Northern Railway after purchase in April 1878. Jay Gould invested personal money to get construction started just beyond Franklin in the fall of 1877. The new plan was not to build the road to Soda Springs, but to build a longer road on a direct route through the Cache Valley, then north across eastern Idaho and north across western Montana to Butte, Montana. In the first year of construction, they reached Eagle Rock (now Idaho Falls, Idaho), north of the Utah/Idaho border, where they built a bridge across the Snake River in early 1879. In the second year, they added another of track and crossed the continental divide at the Idaho/Montana border. After three and a half years of construction, before the close of 1881, they completed the additional of road to Butte, Montana. Butte became the largest copper producing city in the world and Butte&#x27;s population, by some estimates, grew to nearly 100,000. This made Butte, with its &quot;Copper Kings,&quot; the second largest city in the West with more influence than Salt Lake City, Denver, Sacramento, Seattle, or Portland. Only San Francisco remained larger and more important. Butte, with its large-scale mining and smelting operations, was dubbed the Pittsburg of the West.

The Utah &amp; Northern was switched from narrow gauge to on July 25, 1887 only six years after completing the line to Butte. The railroad operated successfully for several years and finally became a branch of the Union Pacific Railroad.

<text>Jermyn Street is a one-way street in the St James&#x27;s area of the City of Westminster in London, England. It is to the south of, parallel, and adjacent to Piccadilly. Jermyn Street is known as a street for gentlemen&#x27;s-clothing retailers in the West End.

==History==

In around 1664, the street was created by and named after Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, as part of his development of the St James&#x27;s area of central London. It was first recorded as &quot;Jarman Streete&quot; in the 1667 rate books of St Martin&#x27;s, which listed 56 properties on it. In 1675, there were 108 names listed.

==Notable residents==
Many tailors owned or still own the houses along the street and often let rooms to people. No. 22, Jermyn Street, for instance was once owned by Italian silk merchant Cesare Salvucci and a military tailor who rented rooms out to people such as the banker Theodore Rothschild.

The Duke of Marlborough lived there when he was Colonel Churchill, as did Isaac Newton (at No. 88, from 1696 to 1700; he then moved next door to No. 87, from 1700 to 1709, during which time he worked as Warden of the Mint), the mid-18th century highwayman and apothecary William Plunkett, the Duchess of Richmond, the Countess of Northumberland and the artist John Keyse Sherwin (in whose rooms in 1782 the actress Sarah Siddons sat for him for her portrait as &quot;Euphrasia&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The Gun Tavern was one of the great resorts for foreigners of revolutionary tastes during the end of the 18th century, whilst Grenier&#x27;s Hotel was patronised by French refugees. At the Brunswick Hotel, Louis Napoleon took up his residence under the assumed name of Count D&#x27;Arenberg on his escape from captivity in the fortress of Ham. 

Though he did not live there, a statue of the dandy Beau Brummell stands on Jermyn Street at its junction with Piccadilly Arcade, as embodying its elegant clothing values. Aleister Crowley lived in No. 93 during the Second World War up until 1 April. It was through Crowley that Nancy Cunard resided in a flat in Jermyn Street.

New Zealand chefs and entertainers, Hudson and Halls, lived in a flat at No. 60 in the 1990s.

==Businesses==
Jermyn Street shops traditionally sell shirts and other gentlemen&#x27;s apparel, such as hats, shoes, shaving brushes, colognes, braces and collar stiffeners. The street is famous for its resident shirtmakers such as Turnbull &amp; Asser, Hawes &amp; Curtis, Thomas Pink, Hilditch &amp; Key, Harvie &amp; Hudson, Emma Willis, and Charles Tyrwhitt. Gentlemen&#x27;s outfitters Hackett is located on Jermyn Street, as well as shoe- and boot-makers John Lobb. A number of other related businesses occupy premises on the street, such as Sartoria dei Duchi - Atri, the men&#x27;s luxury goods brand Alfred Dunhill, who opened its shop on the corner of Jermyn Street and Duke Street in 1907; barbers Geo.F. Trumper, and Taylor of Old Bond Street; and cigar shop Davidoff of London.

The street also contains Britain&#x27;s oldest cheese shop, Paxton &amp; Whitfield, trading since 1797. Floris, a perfumers in the street, has display cabinets acquired directly from the Great Exhibition in 1851.

Forming part of the St James&#x27;s Art District, there are a number of art galleries in Jermyn Street, including The Sladmore Gallery. Shops in this district are required to display art as part of their lease.

Among the restaurants in the street are the historic Wiltons, the long established Rowley&#x27;s Restaurant, the new Fortnum and Mason restaurant, and Franco&#x27;s. Tramp nightclub and the 70-seat Jermyn Street Theatre (the West End&#x27;s smallest) are also on the street.

Many of the buildings on Jermyn Street are owned by the Crown Estate.

== Listed buildings ==
Most of the buildings appear in &quot;Survey of London&quot; in &quot;The Parish of St James Westminster Part 1 South of Piccadilly: Volumes 29 and 30&quot;, Vol. 29 (1960), which can be viewed online.

Nikolaus Pevsner writes in &quot;The Buildings of England&quot; that &quot;The Mid Victorian shop-front of No 97 is one of the best of its date in the West End&quot;. He calls no 93, which houses cheesemakers Paxton &amp; Whitfield, &quot;another good one&quot;.

<text>Sellero (Camunian: ; locally ) is a &quot;comune&quot; of 1,503 people in the province of Brescia (far 83 km from Brescia) in the middle Val Camonica.

In its territory there are thousands of rock engravings, including the &quot;Rosa camuna&quot; in Carpene (which is the symbol of Lombardy region). In the comune&#x27;s territory there are also examples of energy excellence, such as the San Fiorano&#x27;s underground hydroelectric power (in Scianica) and a biomass tele-heating power.

The comune consists of the settlements of Sellero (the most important of the comune) and the frazione of Novelle. Another settlement is Scianica, situated in the valley floor and developed in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Geography ==

The commune is situated in the middle Val Camonica, on the right bank of the river Oglio. Neighbouring communes are Berzo Demo, Capo di Ponte, Cedegolo and Paisco Loveno. The highest point is Monte Elto, which is 2,145 metres high.

==History==
There are traces of Camunnic settlements around Sellero, dating back to the Bronze Age. During the Roman era, the area was sparsely populated. It was repopulated during the Middle Ages. Recently, from 1927 to 1948 the commune joined with Cedegolo, a neighbouring commune.

== Population trends, 1861–2001 ==

Source: ISTAT

== Interesting places ==

The two churches of the town, the parish church (Saint Mary) and the ancient church (Saint Desiderio) present some interesting artistic works.

The parish church, finished in 1785, presents an interesting altar in Sicily&#x27;s and Verona&#x27;s marble and a portal in Vezza d&#x27;Oglio&#x27;s marble. Also the ancient church, erected by Frankish, can be visited and presents some Pietro di Cemmo&#x27;s frescos.

Near the &quot;frazione&quot; of Novelle there are the Carona&#x27;s mines, which can be visited with equipment for speleology.

==Economy ==
Sellero, from 1950 to 1980, was an important industrial town in Valle Camonica, thank to the Scianica&#x27;s little plain.

The first activity started in 1907 when the Curletti company began the utilization of Carona&#x27;s mine for the sulphur&#x27;s mining, and finished in 1951.

With the mines&#x27; utilization some people founded the SEFE (&quot;&quot;, in English &quot;Society for the management of electric furnaces&quot;) which built three furnaces for the calcium carbide&#x27;s production.

Now the first activity is an iron factory, Riva Acciaio (&quot;Riva Iron&quot;).

<doc id="1169414" wikidata="Q326773" url="?curid=1169414" title="Gilbert Sorrentino">
<text>Gilbert Sorrentino (April 27, 1929 – May 18, 2006) was an American novelist, short story writer, poet, literary critic, professor, and editor.

In over twenty-five works of fiction and poetry, Sorrentino explored the comic and formal possibilities of language and literature. His insistence on the primacy of language and his forays into metafiction mark him as a postmodernist, but he is also known for his ear for American speech and his attention to the particularities of place, especially of his native Brooklyn.

==Life==
Sorrentino was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1929. He grew up in the borough&#x27;s Bay Ridge neighborhood and attended Brooklyn College before and after serving in the United States Army Medical Corps during the Korean War. In 1956, Sorrentino founded the literary magazine &quot;Neon&quot; with friends from Brooklyn College, including childhood friend Hubert Selby Jr. He edited &quot;Neon&quot; from 1956 to 1960, then served as editor for &quot;Kulchur&quot; from 1961 to 1963. After working closely with Selby on the manuscript of &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964), Sorrentino was an editor at Grove Press from 1965 to 1970, where one of his editorial projects was &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;.

Sorrentino&#x27;s first marriage, to the former Elsene Wiessner, ended in divorce. The disintegration of their marriage is fictionalized in Sorrentino&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Sky Changes&quot;. They had two children, Jesse (b. 1954) and Delia (1957–2002). In 1968, Sorrentino married Victoria Ortiz. Their son, Christopher Sorrentino, is the author of the novels &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, &quot;Trance&quot;, &quot;The Fugitives&quot;, and a non-fiction book &quot;Now Beacon, Now Sea: A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot;.

He eventually took up positions at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, the University of Scranton and the New School for Social Research in New York before being hired as a professor of English at Stanford University, where he taught from 1982 to 1999. Although Sorrentino never finished his degree, the head of Stanford&#x27;s writing program opined that &quot;Sorrentino is a very learned man – we weren&#x27;t for a second concerned about a &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; seal of approval.&quot; Sorrentino&#x27;s students included the writers Ammiel Alcalay, Trey Ellis, Jeffrey Eugenides, Nicole Krauss, and Jenny Offill.

Following his retirement from Stanford, Sorrentino returned to Bay Ridge, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He died in Brooklyn on May 18, 2006.

==Writing==
Sorrentino&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Sky Changes&quot;, was published in 1966. Notable among his many other novels are &quot;Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things&quot;, &quot;Blue Pastoral&quot;, and &quot;Mulligan Stew&quot;. The latter novel, a humorous postmodern romp, riffs on the metafictional possibilities introduced in Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, and is one of Sorrentino&#x27;s most popular works.

His 1999 novel, &quot;Gold Fools&quot;, is written entirely in interrogative sentences not, as critic Steven Moore says, &quot;just to see if he could pull it off, but because he wanted to interrogate our cultural assumptions about the Old West.&quot;

In 2010 a posthumous novel, &quot;The Abyss of Human Illusion&quot;, was published by Coffee House Press with a preface by Christopher Sorrentino.

==Honors and awards==
Sorrentino was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Guggenheim Fellowships in Fiction in 1973 and 1987, the John Dos Passos Prize for Literature (1981), PEN/Faulkner Award finalist in 1981 and 2003, the Mildred and Harold Strauss Livings of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (declined, 1982), the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Literature (1985), the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction (1992), and the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. In 2020, Community Board 10 and the New York City Parks Department named a section of Leif Erickson Park, in Bay Ridge, after Sorrentino.

<text>John Francis Christopher Ducker (born 16 March 1943), known professionally as John Leeson, is an English actor. He is known for portraying Bungle in &quot;Rainbow&quot; and voicing K9 in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and spin-offs &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;K9&quot;.

== Early career ==
Leeson trained at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and his varied stage and television career spans half a century. It includes work in both repertory and West End productions including Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1969), &quot;Flint&quot; (1970) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Without Me&quot; (1971), and character acting work across a wide range of television sitcoms and costume dramas from the 1970s onwards, including &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Sorry!&quot;, &quot;Rings on Their Fingers&quot;, adaptations of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Noose&quot;, &quot;Crown Court&quot; and &quot;Longitude&quot;. He also embarked on a parallel career in voiceover work, freelancing as a continuity announcer with BFBS Television in Germany, BBC Television, and Channel 4.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot; and spin-offs==
Leeson was first brought on as the voice of K9 in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;. Producer Graham Williams liked the character so much that the decision was made to retain him as a regular character to appeal to the younger members of the audience. Tom Baker, who played the Fourth Doctor, detested the character of K9, but gets on well with Leeson (when Leeson appeared on Tom Baker&#x27;s edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2000, he entered on all fours).

Leeson became worried about how appearing only as the voice of the character would hinder future employment if he was not appearing in visible roles; he left the programme after the conclusion of the 16th season in 1979. He was, however seen on-screen that season as the character Dugeen during the serial &quot;The Power of Kroll&quot; (1978–1979). David Brierley took over for four stories (one of which was never completed due to a BBC strike) the following year. When John Nathan-Turner took over as producer of the series for season 18 in 1980, Leeson agreed to return before the character was written out.

Leeson also agreed to voice K9 in &quot;K-9 and Company&quot; (1981), a spin-off from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; which was not picked up after the airing of its pilot episode. He later voiced K9 for a cameo appearance in the 20th anniversary episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, and has since reprised K9&#x27;s voice in two BBV and several Big Finish audio dramas including &quot;Zagreus&quot; and the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; series.

He voiced K9 for the character&#x27;s return in the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;School Reunion&quot;, leading to giving him recurring character status in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. Leeson&#x27;s then reprised K9 again in the episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. The most recent occasion of Leeson voicing K9 is in the spin-off television series &quot;K9&quot;. Leeson also voiced K9 in a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;.
He did not reprise his role as K9 in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; as he was unavailable at the time, so archive audio was used instead.

Leeson&#x27;s vocal contributions to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; can also be heard as other characters in the serials &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot; and &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;. Leeson played the role of &quot;Prosecutor 2&quot; in the 2005 stage production of &quot;The Trial of Davros&quot; and has compiled a one-man show, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, directed by Richard Fawkes.

In November 2013, Leeson appeared as K9 in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

== Other credits ==
Other credits include appearances in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (in the season A episode &quot;Mission to Destiny&quot; and the season B episode &quot;Gambit&quot;). Also, notably in children&#x27;s programmes, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow&quot; from 1972 as the original Bungle, and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jigsaw&quot; in which he voiced Jigg, the show&#x27;s &quot;mascot&quot; and played the giant Biggum, who was so tall only his feet were seen and his voice heard. He was one of the resident team of actors in stunts for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot; (1981–85), appearing in one memorable stunt involving a car transporter wrecking his car and blaming it on the unsuspecting victim.

His film credits are few but included the Hunt Secretary in the film of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot; (1979), and a TV interviewer in the film version of &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot; (1986). His radio work includes the comedy serial &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1990) in which he played the character of Mike and additionally provided the scripted continuity link at the beginning.

Leeson has read extensively for the audio book charity Calibre Audio Library, and is also the narrator/character voices behind &quot;The Space Gypsy Adventures&quot; on Children&#x27;s UK hospital radio. In 2010 John appeared in a character role in the independent film &quot;Rebels Without A Clue&quot; with actor Rik Barnett.

Away from stage and screen he was regularly heard as continuity announcer on Channel 4 when his warm tones proved a distinct contrast to the K9 voice. A lively interest in both classical music and particularly wine, led him to develop a longstanding parallel career as a wine educator.

Under his birth name he is an accredited tutor for the Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust, and he is a member both of the Association of Wine Educators and the Circle of Wine Writers. He is a freelance lecturer in wine both on land and in cruises at sea, and is a regular tutor for The Wine Education Service Ltd.

==Literature==
Leeson&#x27;s autobiography, entitled &quot;Flight of the Budgerigar&quot;, was published by Hirst in October 2011. It was superseded by an updated and expanded version entitled &quot;Tweaking the Tail&quot; which was published in July 2013 by Fantom Films.

A book of favourite recipes collected across the years, &quot;Dog&#x27;s Dinners&quot; (the title referencing his work as the voice of K9), also published by Fantom, was published in May 2014.

An enthusiastic cook, he also contributed a chapter on teaching wine tasting (in his birth name of John Ducker) to &quot;Educated Tastes: Food, Drink and Connoisseur Culture&quot;, edited by Jeremy Strong, and published by the University of Nebraska Press.

== Personal life ==
In 1969, Leeson married Judy Griffiths, an assistant at the BBC. Their son, Guy Ducker (born 1972), is a film editor and director.

== Public service ==
Now statutorily retired, he also served as a local justice of the peace for over 25 years, having served as Deputy Chairman of his local Bench (Ealing) for six years across the period.

In 2002 and 2010, under his birth name of John Ducker, he stood as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the district of Perivale in the local council elections for Ealing London Borough Council, but failed to be elected.

<doc id="1169422" wikidata="Q112011" url="?curid=1169422" title="Serle">
<text>Serle (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is bordered by the neighboring communes of Nuvolento, Caino and Botticino.

==History==
Framed by the mountains of Valle Sabbia, the municipality of Serle is located in a basin of the valley rising up from the river Chiese to Cariadeghe plateau. The etymology of the name could originate from this morphological feature, since &quot;serule&quot; means dolina. The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic period. Being a Roman settlement, as shown by an old furnace, Serle was very important in the early 11th century, when the bishop of Brescia Olderico founded the monastery of San Peter in Monte Orsino on mount San Bartolomeo. The monastery had a very strong political and religious power and significantly influenced the history of a vast territory until 1446. The town became an independent municipality in 1138 and part of the &quot;quadra di Gavardo&quot; during the Venetian domination. The economy was based on agriculture and cattle rearing in the past; it is now supported by marble extraction, handcrafts, trading of charcoal, and building activities.

Serle played a role in the history of the Italian Risorgimento, due to the heroic acts of the Catholic priest Don Pietro Boifava (1794–1879), a protagonist of the &quot;10 Giornate di Brescia&quot; riot with Tito Speri.

==Places==

===San Bartolomeo&#x27;s church===
The church was built during the 8th century on the ruins of the Benedictine monastery. From the old coenoby, it still keeps Romanesque remains and a fresco by Paolo da Caylina il Giovane in the apse. Also, the church, still existing in 1138 and became a sanctuary of the Beata Vergine Annunciata in 1747, belonged to the monastery.

The imposing parish church dedicated to San Pietro in Vincoli and built during the early 18th century is a rare example of 18th-century style in Lombardy and a National Monument. All churches are decorated with many marble altars made by the &quot;rezzatese&quot; school in Rezzato during the 17th-18th centuries.

==Nature==
The natural monument upland of Cariadeghe is very important for its environmental and speleological features. It is characterized by karstic features including dolinas, caves, and swallow holes conveying water under the ground. A large number of majestic century-old trees grow in the protected area.

==Politics==
Since 2004 the mayor of Serle has been Gianluigi Zanola. The city council has 12 seats. After the June 2009 elections, the new city council has eight seats filled by members of the Democratic Party and four filled by The People of Freedom.

<doc id="1169423" wikidata="Q225657" url="?curid=1169423" title="Henry Gibson">
<text>James Bateman (September 21, 1935 – September 14, 2009), known professionally as Henry Gibson, was an American actor, comedian and poet. He played roles in the television sketch-comedy series &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; from 1968 to 1971, was the voice of the protagonist Wilbur in the animated feature &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), portrayed country star Haven Hamilton in Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), the Illinois Nazi leader in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), and appeared in &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; (1989). His later film roles included starring in &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; (2001) and smaller parts in &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999) and as Father O&#x27;Neil in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005). His final major acting role was as Judge Clark Brown on the television show &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, from 2004 to 2008.

==Early life==
Gibson was born September 21, 1935, in Germantown, Philadelphia, the sixth of seven children of Edmund Alberts Bateman (1896–1980) and his wife Dorothy (née Cassidy) (1903–1975). He attended Saint Joseph&#x27;s Preparatory School, where he was president of the drama club. Gibson had English, Irish, German and distant Dutch ancestry.

After graduating from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., he served as an intelligence officer in the United States Air Force with the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in France from 1957 to 1960. Early in his career as a professional entertainer, he developed a comedy act in which he played a poet from Fairhope, Alabama. He adopted the stage name Henry Gibson, which is a same-sounding phrase for the name of famed Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. He also is known to have used the name Olsen Gibson.

==Career==
Gibson began his acting career at 8 years old, working as a touring performer for the Mae Desmond Theatre for nine years. He appeared in many stage and theater productions. Gibson made many appearances on &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; between 1957 and 1962, often reciting his poetry. In 1962, his appearance coincided with guest-host Jerry Lewis. Lewis, charmed by Gibson&#x27;s demeanor, cast him in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963). Gibson&#x27;s career took off following this film appearance. That was followed in 1964 by his poetry-reciting cowboy character Quirt Manly on the popular show &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Around this time, Gibson appeared in an episode of &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;.

Gibson spent three years as part of the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; television show&#x27;s cast, where he was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1971. He often played &quot;The Poet&quot;, reciting poems with &quot;sharp satirical or political themes&quot;. Gibson would emerge from behind a stage flat, wearing suit and tie and holding an outlandishly large artificial flower. He would bow stiffly from the waist, state &quot;[Title of poem] — by Henry Gibson&quot; in an ironic Southern U.S. accent, again bow stiffly from the waist, recite his poem and return behind the flat. 

Gibson&#x27;s routine was so memorable that guests on the program occasionally performed it, including John Wayne in his own inimitable style: &quot;The Sky — by John Wayne. The Sky is blue/The Grass is green/Get off your butt/And join the Marine(s)!&quot;, whereupon Wayne left the scene by smashing through the flat. Gibson regularly appeared in the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; segments as a Catholic priest, sipping tea. He would put the cup on the saucer, recite his one-liner in a grave and somber tone, then go back to sipping tea. 

In 1962, Gibson recorded a comedy album on Liberty Records, titled &quot;Alligator&quot;. The album was reissued in 1968, now titled &quot;...by Henry Gibson&quot;, following his success on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. The liner notes perpetuated the origin story of being a country boy from Fairhope, Alabama. The album did not reach the Billboard Top 200 in either release. In 1968, Gibson appeared on the television show &quot;Bewitched&quot; as Napoleon Bonaparte. He appeared on &quot;Bewitched&quot; in 1970 as Tim O&#x27;Shanter, a leprechaun. Around this time, Gibson made recurring appearances in the 1969–1974 anthology &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.
During the 1960s, Gibson had appeared on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; reading the poem &quot;Keep a-Goin&quot;, which he later turned into a song in the Robert Altman movie &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975). Notably, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Haven Hamilton in the film and won the National Society of Film Critics award for the role. The &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; called Gibson &quot;the male superstar most surely to be in line for an Academy Award&quot; and hailed his performance as being &quot;so real to Music Row habitués as to be frightening.&quot; Gibson appeared in three other films directed by Altman: &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, starring Elliott Gould, &quot;A Perfect Couple&quot;, and &quot;Health&quot;.

In 1978, he appeared in &quot;The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman&quot; as the arch-villain Mariposa. In 1980, he appeared on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as Will Jason (Squirt) in the second-season episode &quot;Find Loretta Lynn&quot;. The same year, he played the leader of the &quot;Illinois Nazis&quot; in the John Landis film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. This became one of his better-known film roles. In 1981, he appeared in &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;. In 1982, he played con man Henry Beemus on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, S6 E11 &quot;A Christmas Presence&quot;, which aired December 18, 1982.

In the 1989 Joe Dante comedy &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot;, starring Tom Hanks, Gibson played the villain. In 1990, he reunited with director Dante when &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; was released, performing a cameo as the office worker who is caught taking a smoking break on camera and fired by the sadistic boss. 1996 saw him playing an unusual dramatic role as former train conductor Robinson, in the independent film &quot;Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day&quot; with Michael Stipe. In 1996, he was also the voice of Adolf Eichmann in Keith Gordon&#x27;s film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Mother Night&quot;. In 1999, Gibson made an appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Magnolia&quot; as an eccentric barfly who antagonizes former child prodigy Donnie Smith, played by William H. Macy.

Gibson worked frequently as a voice actor in animation, most notably portraying Wilbur the pig in the popular Hanna-Barbera children&#x27;s movie &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973). He later worked for the company again on the cartoon &quot;The Biskitts&quot;. Gibson&#x27;s voice work was featured on &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; as Lord Pain, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; as reporter Bob Jenkins, and &quot;Rocket Power&quot; as grouchy neighbor Merv Stimpleton.

Later television work included a guest role on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; playing the Ferengi Nilva in the 1998 episode &quot;Profit and Lace&quot;. Gibson also had a leading role in a season 5 episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; entitled &quot;The Sentinel&quot; as the character Marul. His last major roles were in the 2005 film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; as Father O&#x27;Neil, and on the television show &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as recurring character Judge Clark Brown.

==Personal life and death==
On April 6, 1966, Gibson married Lois Joan Geiger. They had three sons together – Jonathan David Gibson, an executive at Universal Pictures; Charles Alexander Gibson, a director and visual effects supervisor; and James Gibson, a screenwriter. Lois died on May 6, 2007, at age 77.

Gibson died of cancer on September 14, 2009, one week before his 74th birthday. He was cremated at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, and his ashes were given to his family.

<doc id="1169430" wikidata="Q9016673" url="?curid=1169430" title="Junker (Russia)">
<text>The term Junker ( (&quot;yunker&quot;)) had several meanings in Imperial Russia. The Russian substantive &quot;Yunker&quot; is derived from the German noun &quot;Junker&quot;, where it means &quot;young lord&quot;. 

*Yunker (ru: юнкер) was the rank for a volunteer at military service (ru: вольноопределяющийся, &quot;volnoopredelyayushchiycya&quot;, de: One-year volunteer) in the Imperial Russian Army in 19th and 20th centuries.
**Fanen-yunker/yunker (ru: фанен-юнкер/юнкер) was a military rank for junior officers of dvoryan descent since 1902. 
*Kamer-yunker (ru: камер-юнкер; cf. German &quot;Kammerjunker&quot;) was a courtier title defined in the Table of Ranks, generally equating to &quot;valet de chambre&quot; or Groom of the Chamber.
*Yunker was a term for students of any military or junker school in between 1864 and 1917.

==Junker schools==
Junker schools in Russia were introduced in 1864. They were usually located next to district headquarters in a given region. Junker schools prepared low-rank military for officer rank. In 1900, the Russian government established junker infantry schools in Moscow and Kiev, and in 1902 a junker cavalry school in Yelizavetgrad. In 1901, the government transformed all former district junker schools into seven infantry schools (St. Petersburg, Vilna, Tiflis, Odessa, Kazan, Chuguyev, Irkutsk), one cavalry school (Tver) and three Cossack schools (Novocherkassk, Stavropol, Orenburg).

Every junker school had a three-year program. In order to enroll into a junker school, a student had to attend a gymnasium or cadet corps for six years or pass a corresponding exam.

<doc id="1169434" wikidata="Q1087456" url="?curid=1169434" title="Shanghai Grand">
<text>Shanghai Grand, also known as Shanghai Grand 1996 to differentiate this film from the more illustrious 1980 television series of the same Chinese title, is a 1996 Hong Kong action crime drama film directed by Poon Man-kit and starring Andy Lau, Leslie Cheung, and Ning Jing.

This film was directed by Poon Man-kit and produced by Tsui Hark and his production company Film Workshop. It is a loose adaptation of the 1980 television series &quot;The Bund&quot; in many respects, even though it was done by narrating the action in three segments, each featuring the main characters of the film. Leslie Cheung was cast as Hui Man-keung, the original protagonist of &quot;The Bund&quot;, while Andy Lau was cast as the film&#x27;s protagonist - Hui&#x27;s close friend Ting Lik, a well-meaning but somewhat naive triad leader who was not amused when Hui fell in love with the same girl as the one of his affections. Ning Jing played their love interest Fung Ching-ching.

The story was set in Shanghai during the Republican era, when the city was dominated by triads shortly before it was occupied by the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

==Plot==
Hui Man-keung (Leslie Cheung), an agent the Taiwan People&#x27;s League participates in fighting against Japanese invaders with his fellow comrades. While on their ship back to Taiwan, they were ambushed by the Japanese troops (with the help of a traitor), who want the list of all the nationalists. Hui becomes seriously injured in a gunfight with the Japanese and falls in the water, and ends up in Shanghai and is found by Ting Lik (Andy Lau), a young, low-class labourer but dreams being a powerful triad leader. Ting takes Hui back to his home while confiscating the latter&#x27;s revolver.

Ting has a crush on major triad leader Fung King-yiu&#x27;s (Wu Hsing-kuo) daughter, Fung Ching-ching (Ning Jing), and purchases two film tickets of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; for her and her teacher, Man-lai (Amanda Lee). However, rival triad leader Shorty Chiu attempts to abduct Ching-ching and Ting rescues her and beats up Chiu and trapping him under a truck. This angers Wing, Chiu&#x27;s boss and leader of the Axe Gang, who sets Ting&#x27;s house on fire and demands Ting to settle the score in person. Hui saves Ting&#x27;s mother from the fire and Ting befriends him and promises to take him under his wing while returning him his revolver.

Ting and Hui meet with Wing, but they were held with axes to them by Wing&#x27;s underlings. Wing chops off Ting&#x27;s right pinky, but Ting&#x27;s friend, gives Hui his revolver from outside the window and Hui shoots Wing. Together, Ting and Hui kill Wing&#x27;s underlings before pushing Wing out the window falling to his death. Fung&#x27;s butler, Uncle Lau (Lau Shun), bribes the police to prevent Ting and Hui&#x27;s arrest and Fung puts Ting in charge of Wing&#x27;s territories and Ting rises up as an influential triad leader in Shanghai. Ting becomes more and more ambitious and kills another triad leader and the police chief while also expresses his love for Ching-ching and wins Fung&#x27;s approval. At this time, Ting unexpectedly finds Hui and Ching-ching showering together at the former&#x27;s home. It turns out Hui and Ching-ching met during the summer last year in Northeast China while the former was being chased by the Japanese and had a brief romance but he did not know her name and was shocked she was the woman who Ting was in love with. It turns while Ting was writing love letters to Ching-ching, Lai-man was pretending to be Ching-ching writing letters to Ting and is in love with him.

Before reuniting with Ching-ching, Hui notices Man-lai&#x27;s cheongsam being similar to a Japanese female assassin (Almen Wong) who tried to kill on the ship earlier which leads him to a clothing shop where he is ambushed by the said assassin and some henchmen. Hui kills several henchmen in a gunfight before fleeing with Ching-ching to his home where Ting encounters them. Hui tries to explain his relationship with Ching-ching to Ting, but Ting rebuts him. Hui says he will leave Shanghai with Ching-ching once he settles his business and Ting warns him to take care of Ching-ching or he will kill him. At the time, other members of the People&#x27;s League find Hui and suspects him to be a traitor due to the incident on the ship, but Hui claims to know who the traitor is and persuades them to give him chance to kill the traitor and avenge their comrades.

Fung arranges Ting to meet with a business partner, which is actually a trap for his assassin (the Japanese female assassin who tried to kill Hui) to kill Ting as Fung thinks Ting is too ambitious and sees him as a threat. The assassin attempts to strangle Ting with a phyton snake, but Ting shocks the snake with a chandelier, causing it strangles the assassin instead. At this time, Fung also invites Hui to his mansion where Hui recognizes Fung as the traitor at the ship. Fung also discovers Hui&#x27;s true identity and orders his henchmen to kill him, but Hui ends up killing Fung instead while Ching-ching goes insane after witnessing it. Uncle Lau pleads Ting to care for Ching-ching as well as avenging Fung as everyone in Shanghai is fighting to kill Hui. Ting arranges a meeting with Hui in his bar on New Years Eve where Ting tells Hui the latter broke his promise to take care of Ching-ching. Right after countdown, the two engage in a Mexican standoff with Ting on the upper hand as Hui was shooting blanks as he wanted to repay his &quot;debt&quot; to Ting. Ting also intentionally misses shooting at vital organs and arranges Hui to safely leave Shanghai. Ting walks out his bar and tells Fung&#x27;s former underlings he has killed Hui, which is overhead by a People&#x27;s League agent (Jung Woo-sung), who shoots Ting dead before he himself was gunned down by Ting&#x27;s underlings.

<doc id="1169436" wikidata="Q424085" url="?curid=1169436" title="Charge-transfer complex">
<text>In chemistry, charge-transfer (CT) complex, or electron donor-acceptor complex, describes a type of supramolecular assembly of two or more molecules or ions. The assembly consists of two molecules that self-attract through electrostatic forces, i.e., one has at least partial negative charge and the partner has partial positive charge, referred to respectively as the electron acceptor and electron donor. In some cases, the degree of charge transfer is &quot;complete&quot;, such that the CT complex can be classified as a salt. In other cases, the charge-transfer association is weak, and the interaction can be disrupted easily by polar solvents.

==Examples==
===Electron donor-acceptor complexes ===
A number of organic compounds form charge-transfer complex, which are often described as electron-donor-acceptor complexes (EDA complexes). Typical acceptors are nitrobenzenes or tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). The strength of their interaction with electron donors correlates with the ionization potentials of the components. For TCNE, the stability constants (L/mol) for its complexes with benzene derivatives correlates with the number of methyl groups: benzene (0.128), 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1.11), 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (3.4), and hexamethylbenzene (16.8). A simple example for a prototypical electron-donor-acceptor complexes is nitroaniline.

1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene and related polynitrated aromatic compounds, being electron-deficient, form charge-transfer complexes with many arenes. Such complexes form upon crystallization, but often dissociate in solution to the components. Characteristically, these CT salts crystallize in stacks of alternating donor and acceptor (nitro aromatic) molecules, i.e. A-B-A-B.

===Dihalogen/interhalogen CT complexes===
Early studies on donor-acceptor complexes focused on the solvatochromism exhibited by iodine, which often results from I2 forming adducts with electron donors such as amines and ethers. Dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) and interhalogens XY(X = I; Y = Cl, Br) are Lewis acid species capable of forming a variety of products when reacted with donor species. Among these species (including oxidation or protonated products), CT adducts D·XY have been largely investigated. The CT interaction has been quantified and is the basis of many schemes for parameterizing donor and acceptor properties, such as those devised by Gutmann, Childs, Beckett, and the ECW model.

Many organic species featuring chalcogen or pnictogen donor atoms form CT salts. The nature of the resulting adducts can be investigated both in solution and in the solid state.

In solution, the intensity of charge-transfer bands in the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum is strongly dependent upon the degree (equilibrium constant) of this association reaction. Methods have been developed to determine the equilibrium constant for these complexes in solution by measuring the intensity of absorption bands as a function of the concentration of donor and acceptor components in solution. The Benesi-Hildebrand method, named for its developers, was first described for the association of iodine dissolved in aromatic hydrocarbons.

In the solid state a valuable parameter is the elongation of the X–X or X–Y bond length, resulting from the antibonding nature of the σ* LUMO. The elongation can be evaluated by means of structural determinations (XRD) and FT-Raman spectroscopy.

A well-known example is the complex formed by iodine when combined with starch, which exhibits an intense purple charge-transfer band. This has widespread use as a rough screen for counterfeit currency. Unlike most paper, the paper used in US currency is not sized with starch. Thus, formation of this purple color on application of an iodine solution indicates a counterfeit.

===TTF-TCNQ: prototype for electrically conducting complexes===

In 1954, charge-transfer salts derived from perylene with iodine or bromine were reported with resistivities as low as 8 ohm·cm. In 1973, it was discovered that a combination of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) forms a strong charge-transfer complex referred to as &quot;TTF-TCNQ&quot;. The solid shows almost metallic electrical conductance and was the first-discovered purely organic conductor. In a TTF-TCNQ crystal, TTF and TCNQ molecules are arranged independently in separate parallel-aligned stacks, and an electron transfer occurs from donor (TTF) to acceptor (TCNQ) stacks. Hence, electrons and electron holes are separated and concentrated in the stacks and can traverse in a one-dimensional direction along the TCNQ and TTF columns, respectively, when an electric potential is applied to the ends of a crystal in the stack direction.

Superconductivity is exhibited by tetramethyl-tetraselenafulvalene-hexafluorophosphate (TMTSF2PF6), which is a semi-conductor at ambient conditions, shows superconductivity at low temperature (critical temperature) and high pressure: 0.9 K and 12 kbar. Critical current densities in these complexes are very small.

==Mechanistic implications==
Many reactions involving nucleophiles attacking electrophiles can be usefully assessed from the perspective of an incipient charge-transfer complex. Examples include electrophilic aromatic substitution, the addition of Grignard reagents to ketones, and brominolysis of metal-alkyl bonds.

<text>Sirmione (Brescian: ; ) is a comune in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy (northern Italy). It is bounded by Desenzano del Garda (Lombardy) and Peschiera del Garda in the province of Verona and the region of Veneto. It has a historical centre which is located on the Sirmio peninsula that divides the lower part of Lake Garda.

==History==

The first traces of human presence in the area of Sirmione date from the 6th–5th millennia BC. Settlements on palafitte existed in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.

Starting from the 1st century BC, the area of the Garda, including what is now Sirmione, became a favourite resort for rich families coming from Verona, then the main Roman city in north-eastern Italy. The poet Catullus praised the beauties of the city and spoke of a villa he had in the area.

In the late Roman era (4th–5th centuries AD) the city became a fortified strongpoint defending the southern shore of the lake. A settlement existed also after the Lombard conquest of northern Italy: in the late years of the Lombard kingdom, the city was capital of a judiciary district directly subordinated to the king. Ansa, wife of King Desiderius, founded a monastery and a church in the city.

Around the year 1000, Sirmione was probably a free comune, but fell into the hands of the Scaliger in the early 13th century. Mastino I della Scala was probably the founder of the castle. In the same period, Sirmione was refuge for Patarines hereticals. The military role of the city continued until the 16th century, but a garrison remained in the castle until the 19th century.

Sirmione was a possession of the Venetian Republic from 1405 until 1797, when it was acquired by the Habsburg Empire. It became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860.

==Main sights==

* The main historical landmark of Sirmione is the so-called Grottoes of Catullus (), the most striking example of a Roman private edifice discovered in northern Italy. The edifice had a rectangular plan and measured .
* The Scaligero Castle (13th century). This is a rare example of medieval port fortification, which was used by the Scaliger fleet. The building of this complex started in 1277 by Mastino della Scala. It presents the typical Ghibelline swallowtail merlons and the curtain-walls (with three corner towers) in pebbles alternating with two horizontal bands of brick courses. The walls on the inside were finished with plaster with graffiti, simulating blocks of stone. The castle stands at a strategic place at the entrance to the peninsula. It is surrounded by a moat and it can only be entered by two drawbridges. The castle was established mainly as a protection against enemies, but also against the locals. The main room houses a small museum with local finds from the Roman era and a few medieval artifacts.
* The small church of , next to the castle. It dates from the 12th century and was used mainly by the garrison and the few local villagers. The frescoes in the church date from the 14th–17th century.
* The church of , built in Lombard times (AD 765) but renovated in the early 14th century. At the portal one can see a brick wall with the date 1320. It is secluded from the town and is situated on the hill. The term refers to the Latin phrase (up in the vineyards). The church has a rectangular plan and is oriented east–west. The chancel contains three apses. The one in the middle shows a Christ Pantocrator in Byzantine tradition; the one on the left a Madonna Enthroned; the one on the right a Crucifixion. The ceiling is made of wooden beams. The church contains frescoes from the 12th–16th centuries. The Romanesque bell tower dates from 1070. The church has been used in the past as a military hospital and its surroundings as a cemetery for plague victims.
* The church (late 15th century) is located in the town centre. It stands on the site of the former Lombard church of San Martino (second half of the 8th century). It has a rectangular shape with a polygonal apse and is oriented east–west. It has a single nave, divided by three arches. It is decorated with early 15th-century frescoes. The frescoes at the bottom of the north wall even belong to an earlier period. The contemporary wooden statue of the &quot;Madonna Enthroned&quot; is also of special interest.

==World Heritage Site==
The prehistoric settlement at Lugana Vecchia is part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Municipal government==
Sirmione is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995, the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1995, the mayor of Sirmione is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Luisa Lavelli (FI), who in May 2018 as deputy mayor replaced the former mayor Alessandro Mattinzoli, elected regional councillor. Lavelli was finally elected mayor on 26 May 2019 with the 50.1% of the votes and re-elected on 10 June 2024 with 33% of the votes.

==Notable people==
*The poet Gaius Valerius Catullus (c. 84 - c. 54 BCE) lived in the 1st century BC. His family owned a villa in Sirmione.
*Alfred Tennyson described his impressions of Sirmione in the summer of 1880 in his poem &quot;Frater Ave atque Vale&quot;.
*Italian writers who wrote about Sirmione include Giosuè Carducci, Antonio Fogazzaro and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio.
*Ezra Pound and James Joyce met in the city in 1920.
*Maria Callas had a villa in Sirmione.
*English writer Naomi Jacob lived in Sirmione until her death in 1964. A small plaque in Sirmione commemorates her.
*Blessed Benedetta Bianchi Porro lived in Sirmione, when her family moved in the 1940s, where her father, Guido was in charge of the hot spring aqueducts. She died on 23 January 1964; a small plaque is placed in the town to commemorate her presence, especially that she is now closer to becoming a Saint of the Catholic Church.

<text>William Laird Cowher (; born May 8, 1957) is an American sports analyst, former professional football player and coach. Following a six-year playing career as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL), he served as a head coach in the NFL for 15 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He began his coaching career as an assistant under Marty Schottenheimer for the Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs, serving as the latter&#x27;s defensive coordinator from 1989 to 1991. In 1992, Cowher was named head coach of the Steelers, whom he led until his retirement following the 2006 season. After retiring, he joined &quot;The NFL Today&quot; as a studio analyst.

Under Cowher, Pittsburgh won eight division titles, two AFC Championship Games, and Super Bowl XL. Cowher&#x27;s Super Bowl victory marked the first championship title for the franchise in over two decades and the first not to be won by Chuck Noll, his predecessor. The Steelers appeared in the postseason 10 times with Cowher, including six consecutive appearances from his 1992 hiring to 1997, which made him the second NFL head coach to reach the playoffs during each of his first six seasons after Paul Brown. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Early life and college career==
Cowher was born and raised in Crafton, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Growing up, he lived only about 15 miles from Three Rivers Stadium. He is the son of the late Laird and Dorothy Cowher. His father attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh&#x27;s south side neighborhood where he was briefly a classmate with eventual Steelers owner Dan Rooney. He has two brothers; Dale and Doug. The Cowher family resided on Hawthorne Avenue, in Crafton, while Cowher was growing up.
While attending Carlynton High School, Cowher excelled in football, basketball, and track. He was named &quot;Most Athletic&quot; and was a captain of the Cougars football team, both his senior year. Despite his efforts on the field, Cowher was not offered many scholarships as a football player due to being deemed &quot;undersized&quot; for the linebacker position.

When Cowher graduated in 1975, he committed to North Carolina State University, one of few schools that offered him a scholarship. During his time at NC State, he was a three-year starting linebacker for the Wolfpack. He currently owns the school record for most tackles in a single season with 195. During his senior season, he was voted to be a team captain and was named the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP). Cowher graduated from NC State in 1979, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education while he was also preparing for the 1979 NFL Draft.

Cowher&#x27;s college performance was motivated by making games “personal”. He would often re-read his rejection letters from schools he would play against with NC State. His strategy of playing angry and internalizing personal connections against his opponents would later influence his aggressive coaching style. Cowher once compared himself to Freddy Krueger stating he wanted to be his opponents “worst nightmare”.

==Professional career==
Cowher went undrafted in the 1979 NFL draft.

He began his NFL career as a linebacker with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1979, but signed with the Cleveland Browns the following year. Cowher played three seasons from 1980 to 1982 in Cleveland, making him a member of the Kardiac Kids, before being traded back to the Eagles, where he played two more years from 1983 to 1984. His tenure in Philadelphia included tackling a young Jeff Fisher (who later became the head coach of the Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams) when playing against the Chicago Bears, causing Fisher to break his leg. The two would later be rival head coaches and friends in the AFC Central division, and Fisher has credited his injury at the hands of Cowher with having the unintended consequence of propelling him into coaching.

Cowher primarily played special teams during his playing career; subsequently, he placed emphasis on special teams during his coaching career. Cowher credits being a &quot;bubble player&quot; during his playing career with influencing his coaching career, feeling that such players work the hardest for a roster spot (and sometimes still get cut, hence the term &quot;bubble player&quot;), and thus make better head coaches than those with successful playing careers.

==Coaching career==
===Assistant jobs===
Cowher began his coaching career in 1985 at age 28 under Marty Schottenheimer with the Cleveland Browns. Cowher, who had played under Schottenheimer in Cleveland when Schottenheimer was the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator, stated that he took a coaching position despite taking a significant pay cut from what he would have made as a player with the Eagles in 1985 because he saw his fortunes as a player limited and saw more of a future as a coach.

He was the Browns&#x27; special teams coach in 1985–86 and secondary coach in 1987–88, during which he formed a bond with New York Giants defensive coordinator Bill Belichick and helped Belichick learn how to coach defensive backs while teaching Cowher how to coach linebackers. Belichick was impressed enough with Cowher that he and Giants head coach Bill Parcells offered to make Cowher the Giants defensive backs coach following Schottenheimer&#x27;s sudden departure from Cleveland in 1988, but Cowher opted to remain loyal to Schottenheimer.

Following Schottenheimer to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1989, Cowher was named defensive coordinator, becoming close with legendary Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas. He interviewed with the Browns for their head coaching vacancy in 1991 before losing out to close friend Belichick; it is believed that Cowher&#x27;s young age at the time played a factor in losing out to Belichick. He was a finalist for the Cincinnati Bengals head coaching position in 1991 following the dismissal of Sam Wyche, but was passed over in favor of Dave Shula.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===

He became the 15th head coach in Steelers history when he succeeded Chuck Noll on January 21, 1992 – but only the team&#x27;s second head coach since the NFL merger in 1970, beating out fellow Pittsburgh native and Pitt alumnus (and eventual Pitt head coach) Dave Wannstedt (Wannstedt instead became the coach of the Chicago Bears the following season). Cowher continued a trend for the Steelers hiring coaches in their 30s that dates back to Joe Bach who began coaching the Steelers in 1935 when they were still named the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Under Cowher, the Steelers showed an immediate improvement from the disappointing 7–9 season the year before, going 11–5 and earning home-field advantage in the AFC after the Steelers had missed the playoffs six times out of the previous seven years. His first season as a head coach came to an end in the AFC Divisional round on January 9, 1993, against the Buffalo Bills in which the Steelers would lose 24–3.
The following season ended with a record of 9–7 for the Steelers. Under Cowher, the team scored a total of 308 points and allowed just 281 points against them. Though the Steelers fell 27–24 in the AFC Wildcard round to the Kansas City Chiefs, it became the first time in a decade the Steelers had back-to-back playoff appearances.

In the 1995 regular season, Cowher got the team to record 11 wins and five losses, once again sending them to the playoffs and earned them a first round bye. The Steelers were able to defeat the Buffalo Bills, who were coming off of four straight Super Bowl appearances, 40–24 and recorded a 20–16 victory against the Indianapolis Colts. Their win against the Colts made the Steelers AFC Champions for the first time since the 1979 season. At age 38, he became the youngest coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl, which the Steelers lost 27–17 to the Dallas Cowboys. Cowher is only the second coach in NFL history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons as head coach, joining Pro Football Hall of Fame member Paul Brown.

In 1998, Cowher led the team to their first losing season of his tenure, breaking a six-year streak of playoff teams. With quarterback Kordell Stewart at the helm, Cowher and the team finished with a record of 7-9 and placing third in the AFC Central. The following season, Pittsburgh would see a second consecutive losing season for the first time since the 1985 and 1986 seasons. Despite a 4–3 start to the season heading into the bye week, the Steelers would go 2–7 on the remainder of the season to finish with a record of 6–10.
During the late 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s, Cowher became known for drafting lineman with first round picks, which drew criticism from Steelers fans. During his tenure, the team had mixed results with this strategy, drafting future Hall of Famer Alan Faneca and future Pro Bowlers Leon Searcy &amp; Casey Hampton but also drafting Jamain Stephens (who would go on to be one of the team&#x27;s biggest first-round busts) and Kendall Simmons (a solid starter but plagued by injuries and a sudden diagnosis of type 1 diabetes), with Stephens infamously being cut after failing the 40-yard dash on the first day of training camp. Between 1992 and 2002, the Steelers drafted five linemen on both the defensive and offensive sides in the first round, making up nearly half of Cowher&#x27;s first round picks in the first decade of his tenure. Defendants of this strategy pointed out that of the five lineman drafted, only Stephens was a bonafide bust and of the skill position players the Steelers did draft with their first round picks (Deon Figures, Charles Johnson, Mark Bruener, Chad Scott, Troy Edwards, and Plaxico Burress), with the exception of Bruener and to a lesser extent Scott and Burress largely didn&#x27;t live up to expectations, though only Edwards would be a bust. (Notably, the Steelers drafted Edwards and Burress, both wide receivers, despite having third-round pick Hines Ward already on their roster to replace Johnson and Yancey Thigpen following their departures in free agency; Ward would outright supplant Edwards on the depth chart by 2000.) Cowher&#x27;s draft picks began to focus on skill positions in 2003 when cornerstone defensive back Troy Polamalu was taken with the 16th overall pick.

The 2003 season would prove challenging for Cowher and the Steelers when the team was only able to win six of their 16 regular season games, missing the playoffs. Due to their poor record, it allowed for Cowher&#x27;s team to draft Ben Roethlisberger with the 11th overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft. Cowher did not initially want to select Roethlisberger in the first round as he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with starter Tommy Maddox and backup Charlie Batch. His original decision was to draft Shawn Andrews, an offensive tackle from the University of Arkansas. Before the pick could be sent in during the draft, Steelers owner Dan Rooney overrode the decision and took Roethlisberger.

Cowher and the team would rebound from their previous season with a record of 15–1, earning a first round bye in the playoffs yet again. The Steelers would make another AFC Championship appearance, losing 41–27 to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots.
In 2005, the Steelers were able to clinch a spot in the playoffs with an 11–5 record as the sixth seeded team in the AFC. The Steelers led an upset playoff run, including a 21–18 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, the top seeded team in the AFC. Cowher would win his second AFC Championship on January 22, 2006, when the Steelers defeated the Denver Broncos 34–17. On February 5, 2006, Cowher&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowl XL by defeating the Seattle Seahawks 21–10, giving Cowher his first Super Bowl ring and making the Steelers the first sixth seed to win a Super Bowl in NFL history. Including the Super Bowl, Cowher&#x27;s teams over the years had compiled a record of 108–1–1 in games in which they built a lead of at least 11 points.

On January 5, 2007, Cowher resigned after 15 years of being the Steelers head coach. Cowher&#x27;s record as a head coach was 161–99–1, including the playoffs. He was succeeded by Mike Tomlin. In Cowher&#x27;s 15 seasons, the Steelers captured eight division titles, earned 10 postseason playoff berths (including six straight in his first six seasons), played in 21 playoff games, advanced to six AFC Championship games and made two Super Bowl appearances. He is one of only six coaches in NFL history to claim at least seven division titles. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, the Steelers had the best record of any team in the NFL since Cowher was hired as head coach.

On January 11, 2020, Cowher was told live on a CBS pregame show that he was being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its centennial class by its president David Baker.

====Coaching philosophy and legacy====
Much like his mentor Marty Schottenheimer, Cowher believed in a strong defense with an emphasis on special teams performance, complimented by a strong running game on offense. Unlike the conservative Schottenheimer, however, Cowher was known to take more risks, including going for it on fourth down, such as his first game as a head coach against the Houston Oilers when he had punter Mark Royals throw a fake punt to Warren Williams and putting the Steelers near the goal line.

Unlike the stoic Noll, Cowher was known to be more fiery and emotional, specifically with his jaw line when he was angry and being known as &quot;the Chin&quot;. This was exemplified in a 1995 game against the Minnesota Vikings when the referees mistakenly penalized the Steelers for 12 men on the field following a missed field goal. The Vikings made the subsequent rekick despite Cowher&#x27;s protests that they had the regulated 11 players on the field, and stuffed an &quot;all-22&quot; photo as proof into referee Gordon McCarter&#x27;s pocket, leading to a $7,500 fine by the NFL for Cowher putting his hands on an official. Cowher is also known for being a vocal supporter of the coaching profession in general and was upset that the Indianapolis Colts hired former center Jeff Saturday as interim head coach in 2022 despite having no coaching experience above the high school level and the team having several assistants already on the staff with previous head coaching experience.

==After coaching==

On February 15, 2007, he signed on to &quot;The NFL Today&quot; on CBS as a studio analyst, joining Dan Marino, Shannon Sharpe, and Boomer Esiason. Cowher also serves as a host the NFL&#x27;s CBS Halftime Report. In November 2024, Cowher confirmed he will be re-signing with CBS in 2025, keeping him as a host for 19 years.

In 2007, Cowher appeared in the ABC reality television series &quot;Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race&quot;, featuring a dozen celebrities in a stock car racing competition. Cowher matched up against Gabrielle Reece and William Shatner.

On March 4, 2008, Cowher responded to rumors concerning his coaching future by stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not going anywhere.&quot; The rumors started after the Cowhers placed their Raleigh, North Carolina home on the market, but their intention was to build a new house two miles away.

Putting an end to numerous unfounded rumors of his return to coaching in the NFL in 2009, Cowher stated on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; that he did not plan to coach again in the immediate future.

In July 2010, Cowher was the keynote speaker for National Agents Alliance at their Leadership Conference. He talked about work ethic, leadership and how that transfers into the work force. He said it&#x27;s not about what you accomplish, it&#x27;s about who you touch along the way.

Cowher had a part in the movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), which was filmed at Heinz Field, the home of the Steelers, on Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side. He played the head coach of the Gotham Rogues.

In May 2023, Cowher reunited with Ben Roethlisberger on Roethlisberger&#x27;s podcast &quot;Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger&quot;.

On August 11, 2023, NC State announced that Cowher would be inducted into its Ring of Honor with the ceremony taking place before the Wolfpack&#x27;s September 29 game versus Louisville.

<doc id="1169455" wikidata="Q5115965" url="?curid=1169455" title="December 2001 riots in Argentina">
<text>The December 2001 crisis, sometimes known as the Argentinazo (), was a period of civil unrest and rioting in Argentina, which took place during December 2001, with the most violent incidents taking place on 19 and 20 December in the capital, Buenos Aires, Rosario and other large cities around the country. It was preceded by a popular revolt against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto &quot;All of them must go!&quot; (), which caused the resignation of then-president Fernando de la Rúa, giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the Argentine presidency. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the Argentine great depression, an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 2002.

The December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government&#x27;s imposition of &quot;Corral&quot; policies () at the behest of economic minister Domingo Cavallo, which restricted people&#x27;s ability to withdraw cash from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president&#x27;s declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the Argentine government that would persist for the following years.

The majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization. Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by police and security forces, most of them during sackings in provinces governed by the Peronists opposition. Of the 39 killed, nine were minors.

== Background ==

=== The Argentine economy ===

Fernando de la Rúa, as the candidate for the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the Convertibility plan () passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the Argentine peso to the United States dollar.

While political reforms under the previous president Carlos Menem had succeeded in reducing inflation, the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997. Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the privatization of nearly all of the Argentine state&#x27;s industries and pension funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina&#x27;s agriculture export-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more sovereign debt.

=== Fernando de la Rúa&#x27;s presidency ===
One of the key factors leading to the victory of the &quot;Alliance&quot; in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la Rúa&#x27;s campaign slogans declared &quot;With me, one peso, one dollar&quot; (). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in Brazil, one of Argentina&#x27;s key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased monetary sovereignty from the left and some Peronists, the &quot;Alliance&quot; committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.

De la Rúa&#x27;s political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (), a coalition formed by the Radical Civic Union and the FrePaSo, which managed to defeat the incumbent Justicialist Party (the Peronist party) in that year&#x27;s presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Santa Fe provinces.

The government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being &quot;junior members&quot; of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la Rúa was a leader of the party&#x27;s conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a political scandal broke out when it was reported that SIDE, Argentina&#x27;s intelligence service, had paid massive bribes to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santibañes, was a personal friend of De la Rúa. The crisis came to a head in October 2000 when Vice President Carlos Álvarez resigned, citing De la Rúa&#x27;s unwillingness to tackle corruption.

==== March 2001 Crisis ====
De la Rúa&#x27;s economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister José Luis Machinea resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister Ricardo López Murphy, who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, López Murphy was replaced by Domingo Cavallo, who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem&#x27;s presidency.

Because of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and refinancing under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), named &quot;The armoring&quot; () and &quot;The Megaexchange&quot; () respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and money laundering about the &quot;megacanje&quot;.

The crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la Rúa without political support. The congressional elections of October 2001 were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina&#x27;s voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator Ramón Puerta to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la Rúa&#x27;s political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta&#x27;s designation meant that De la Rúa had a virtual Peronist Vice President.

Social unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the piqueteros (&quot;picketeers&quot;), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros blockaded major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other welfare measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis.

The crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major investors began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentine banking system due to capital flight. This was compounded by the IMF&#x27;s decision to refuse to refinance Argentina&#x27;s debt.

=== Corralito ===

At the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentine banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the middle class (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentine population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December.

Although people could still use their money via credit cards, checks and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina&#x27;s political scenario.

De la Rúa&#x27;s position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the Catholic Church to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters who demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of supermarkets and convenience stores on 18 December, taking place in the Rosario and Greater Buenos Aires areas.

=== General strike and looting ===
On 13 December, the General Confederation of Labour and the Argentine Workers&#x27; Central Union declared their seventh general strike against the policies of de la Rúa&#x27;s government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the financial sector and un-unionized workplaces.

During the time of the strike, there were riots in the working class neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking &quot;piqueteros&quot;. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country&#x27;s interior and in Buenos Aires. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.

== 19 December ==

Throughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of Buenos Aires. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the Buenos Aires Provincial Police (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor Carlos Ruckauf, a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina&#x27;s major cities, President De la Rúa began to consider alternative measures to restore order.

The first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President Isabel Perón issued an executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla movements of the 1970s (see Dirty War). 

With military intervention no longer an option, De la Rúa resorted to declare a state of siege (essentially a state of emergency) throughout the country, deploying the Federal Police, the National Gendarmerie (border guard) and the Naval Prefecture (coast guard) to contain the growing violence.

Later that night, De la Rúa addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a &quot;government of national unity&quot;. Following the broadcast, spontaneous &quot;cacerolazos&quot; (&quot;pot banging&quot;) took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class&#x27; own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to Plaza de Mayo, where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.

== 20 December ==

What had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the &quot;cacerolazos&quot;, and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation. The De la Rúa administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development.

Throughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege. The Federal Police, acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters.

As violence expanded, President De la Rúa tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la Rúa&#x27;s own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state&#x27;s repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza.

Violent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. 

With his options steadily being reduced, De la Rúa went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of San Luis. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a &quot;government of national unity&quot;.

When he heard the Peronists&#x27; response, De la Rúa decided to resign from office. The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the Casa Rosada, the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la Rúa to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President&#x27;s security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic images of De la Rúa&#x27;s &quot;escape&quot; by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country. The violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires.

With Álvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, Ramón Puerta, took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la Rúa.

=== Victims and criminal investigation ===

All told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the &quot;Plaza de Mayo Massacre&quot; (), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentine Federal Police, Ruben Santos.

While various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.

== Rodríguez Saá Administration ==

According to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be president until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new president from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President&#x27;s period.

The Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three &quot;natural candidates&quot;, who were the governors of the three largest provinces: Carlos Ruckauf of Buenos Aires, José Manuel de la Sota of Córdoba and Carlos Reutemann of Santa Fe. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Governor of San Luis. The Peronists&#x27; easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodríguez Saá was elected on 22 December.

While de la Rúa&#x27;s term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodríguez Saá was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a ballotage would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la Rúa&#x27;s term.

However, Rodríguez Saá didn&#x27;t seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodríguez Saá embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would default on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a &quot;third currency&quot; (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodríguez Saá announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege.

There were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires Carlos Grosso, arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodríguez Saá also courted the powerful Peronist trade unions in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors.

New riots and &quot;cacerolazos&quot; took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodríguez Saá called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, south of Mar del Plata. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodríguez Saá returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.

== Designation of Eduardo Duhalde ==

Ramón Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: Eduardo Camaño, who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies.

Camaño was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator Eduardo Duhalde as president almost at midnight.

Duhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde&#x27;s political career was ruined after his defeat in the 1999 presidential elections. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la Rúa. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la Rúa until the 2003 presidential elections.

With regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so-called &quot;pesificación&quot; (&quot;peso-ification&quot;, a forced transformation of all dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed exchange rate), and a regulated devaluation. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large depreciation.

== Social changes ==
During the unrest millions of people formed neighbourhood assemblies, occupied unused land and factories, created barter and mutual aid networks, implemented workers&#x27; self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties. Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by anarchists.

<doc id="1169457" wikidata="Q4963362" url="?curid=1169457" title="Brian Clark (September 11 survivor)">
<text>Brian Clark (born July 4, 1947) is a Canadian businessman and survivor of the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Clark worked for the American international brokerage firm Euro Brokers Inc. (later merged into BGC Partners), which lost 61 employees that day, nearly one-fifth of its New York branch.

Clark was one of only 18 people in the South Tower to escape from within or above the impact zone where the plane struck, escaping from his office on floor 84. Clark&#x27;s testimony before the 9/11 Commission, where he detailed problems with the 911 emergency call system, has been widely quoted.

==September 11, 2001==

===Rescue of Stanley Praimnath===

After Flight 175 struck the South Tower between floors 77 and 85, Clark and eight other employees of his floor who had survived the impact gathered together and started to descend Stairwell A. They only made it to the 81st floor when Clark and his group were met by a woman and a man coming up the stairs. The woman blocked their paths and warned them there were flames and smoke further down, and their only option was to try and go up to the roof in hope of being rescued from there.

Clark and his coworkers stopped and debated on the stairwell landing about what to do next; whether to listen to the woman and go up the stairs or to ignore her warnings and go down the stairs. As the group stood there debating their next move, a faint scream for help coming from inside the 81st floor caught Clark&#x27;s attention. While his group continued to debate what to do, Clark grabbed coworker Ron DiFrancesco and entered the 81st floor to look for the person screaming for help. As Clark and DiFrancesco entered the floor, Clark turned around to observe his coworkers as they started to go up the stairs to the roof instead of down. That group would all lose their lives that day, as access doors to the roof were locked, and there were no plans for helicopter rescues from the roof, as the NYPD deemed it too unsafe to attempt due to dense clouds of smoke and rooftop antennas.

As Clark and DiFrancesco made their way to the voice screaming for help, DiFrancesco became overcome with smoke and returned to the stairs, which he would also ascend. Unlike the rest of his coworkers who went up the stairs, however, DiFrancesco reversed course and survived. Clark made his way to find Fuji Bank employee Stanley Praimnath, who was pinned underneath some debris behind a wall that had stood firm.

Praimnath had initially evacuated the building after the first plane had hit the North Tower but went back inside as South Tower security gave clearance to reenter the building. Once he had arrived back at his office on the 81st floor, he was on the phone when he noticed the second plane coming right at him. He screamed and jumped under his desk as the plane was hitting the building. After the impact, Praimnath found himself alive under his desk with only minor injuries; the left wing of United Airlines Flight 175 had sliced through his office and become lodged in a door only from him. When Clark found Praimnath, there was a wall standing between the two, and the only way for Praimnath to escape was to jump up and go over the wall.

Praimnath was unsure he would be able to get over the wall but tried due to Clark&#x27;s urging. Praimnath made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the wall, on one occasion injuring his hand, but he persisted, and on another attempt Clark was able to hook his arms around Praimnath and help pull him to the other side.

===Descent===
Clark and Praimnath&#x27;s descent through the floors of the impact was impeded by some debris and smoke, but by moving the debris, they made it passable.

The phones were working in Oppenheimer&#x27;s offices on the 31st floor. Clark was on the telephone for over three minutes and talked to three different people before his 911 call was understood. This call might have been the only chance for rescue workers to learn that there was a clear stairwell that the several hundred people trapped above the impact could try to use to escape. Clark described how he and Praimnath did not feel a sense of urgency, and before calling 911 they each made one brief personal call.

At 9:55 am, they got to the ground floor where there were rescue workers. One advised them to run once they exited onto Liberty Street, at the southeast corner of the complex. At 9:56 am, Clark and Praimnath ran out of the World Trade Center complex. Clark described how, when they had gotten about two blocks away, Praimnath told him he thought the buildings were going to go down. Clark was skeptical, repeating how solidly built the towers were, but he did not finish his sentence before the South Tower (Tower Two) started to collapse. Clark and Praimnath had left the South Tower just three minutes before it collapsed; they were two of the last 25 people to exit the building; Clark was number 22. Only two other people exited the South Tower after Clark and Praimnath.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11StoryClark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===

Praimnath thanked Clark for saving his life. Clark, in turn, also thanked Praimnath since he felt that the act of leaving his group and freeing Praimnath drew him out of a debate that might have ended with his joining the others who went up to their deaths. His Euro Brokers colleague, Ron DiFrancesco, who had initially turned around because of the smoke, mustered the strength to resume the descent and was the last person to escape the South Tower before its collapse; he awoke several days later in a hospital, suffering from extensive burns and a head laceration.

Sixty-one of Clark&#x27;s co-workers were killed in the attack. Clark was later appointed by his company&#x27;s management to be President of the Euro Brokers Relief Fund, created to help take financial care of the families of those who were lost. He retired in 2006, a year after Euro Brokers merged with another company. Since his retirement, he has been volunteering with various non-profit organisations, including serving on the board and as treasurer of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey.

==In popular culture==
* Clark&#x27;s and others&#x27; stories were told on the BBC docudrama &quot;9/11: The Twin Towers&quot; (2006, a.k.a. &quot;Inside the Twin Towers&quot;). Clark is played by Robert Jezek.
* His story is also chronicled on the documentary &quot;United by 9/11&quot; (2006).
* Together with Stanley Praimnath, his story was once again featured in the National Geographic Channel documentary &quot;9/11: One Day in America&quot; (2021).
* In 2020, his story was included in Episode 1 of Season 2 of &quot;The UnXplained&quot;. It focused on his perspective that an unseen force convinced him to select the only one of three stairwells which were usable.

<doc id="1169469" wikidata="Q887369" url="?curid=1169469" title="AC adapter">
<text>An AC adapter or AC/DC adapter (also called a wall charger, power adapter, power brick, or wall wart) is a type of external power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an AC plug. AC adapters deliver electric power to devices that lack internal components to draw voltage and power from mains power themselves. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is often very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.

When used with battery-powered equipment, adapters typically charge the battery as well as powering the equipment.

Aside from obviating the need for internal power supplies, adapters offer flexibility: a device can draw power from 120 VAC or 230 VAC mains, vehicle battery, or aircraft battery, just by using different adapters. Safety can be another advantage, as hazardous 120 or 240 volt mains power is transformed to a lower, safer voltage at the wall outlet before going into the appliance handled by the user.

==Modes of operation==
Originally, most AC/DC adapters were linear power supplies, containing a transformer to convert the mains electricity voltage to a lower voltage, a rectifier to convert it to pulsating DC, and a filter to smooth the pulsating waveform to DC, with residual ripple variations small enough to leave the powered device unaffected. Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn was determined by the power output and mains frequency. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output voltage of these adapters varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, linear voltage regulator circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load.

Early in the twenty-first century, switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) became almost ubiquitous for this purpose due to their compact size and light weight relative to their power output ability. Mains voltage is rectified to a high direct voltage driving a switching circuit, which contains a transformer operating at a high frequency and outputs direct current at the desired voltage. The high-frequency ripple is more easily filtered out than mains-frequency. The high frequency allows the transformer to be small, which reduces its losses; and the switching regulator can be much more efficient than a linear regulator. The result is a much more efficient, smaller, and lighter device. Safety is ensured, as in the older linear circuit, because a transformer still provides galvanic isolation.

A linear circuit must be designed for a specific, narrow range of input voltages (e.g., 220–240 VAC) and must use a transformer appropriate for the frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz), but a switched-mode supply can work efficiently over a very wide range of voltages and frequencies; a single 100–240 VAC unit will handle almost any mains supply in the world.

Many inexpensive switched-mode AC adapters do not implement adequate filtering and/or shielding for electromagnetic interference that they generate. The nature of these high speed, high-energy switching designs is such that when these preventative measures are not implemented, relatively high energy harmonics can be generated, and radiated, well into the radio portion of the spectrum. The amount of RF energy typically decreases with frequency; so, for instance, interference in the medium wave (US AM) broadcast band in the one megahertz region may be strong, while interference with the FM broadcast band around 100 megahertz may be considerably less. Distance is a factor; the closer the interference is to a radio receiver, the more intense it will be. Even WiFi reception in the gigahertz range can be degraded if the receiving antennae are very close to a radiating AC adapter. A determination of if interference is coming from a specific AC adapter can be made simply by unplugging the suspect adapter while observing the amount of interference received in the problem radio band. In a modern household or business environment, there may be multiple AC adapters in use; in such a case, unplug them all, then plug them back in one by one until the culprit or culprits is found.

Traditionally, wall adapters provided a constant voltage. For USB-powered devices, it is 5 volts. Later, battery charging protocols such as Quick Charge by Qualcomm and USB Power Delivery started allowing charged devices to request different voltages suited for their needs, usually higher voltages to increase power without adding heat to the copper wires of the USB cable. In the past, &quot;SuperCharge&quot; by Huawei and &quot;Dash Charge&quot; by OnePlus did the opposite, requesting a slightly lowered voltage to directly match the battery voltage inside the smartphone so no change of voltage has to take place inside the phone, leading to less heating up. This required special USB cables with thicker copper wires.

In the early 2020s, the use of gallium nitride instead of silicon in switching wall adapters bumped up their output power at the same physical size, making compact wall warts able to power even some laptops, not only smartphones and tablet computers. The creation of Gallium Nitride chargers was delayed owing to their excessive costs and that fast charging technology was less in demand than it has become after 2020.

==Advantages==

External AC adapters are widely used to power small or portable electronic devices. The advantages include:

* Safety – External power adapters can free product designers from worrying about some safety issues. Much of this style of equipment uses only voltages low enough not to be a safety hazard internally, although the power supply must out of necessity use dangerous mains voltage. If an external power supply is used (usually via a power connector, often of coaxial type), the equipment need not be designed with concern for hazardous voltages inside the enclosure. This is particularly relevant for equipment with lightweight cases which may break and expose internal electrical parts.
* Heat reduction – Heat reduces reliability and longevity of electronic components, and can cause sensitive circuits to become inaccurate or malfunction. A separate power supply removes a source of heat from the apparatus.
* Electrical noise reduction – Because radiated electrical noise falls off with the square of the distance, it is to the manufacturer&#x27;s advantage to convert potentially noisy AC line power or automotive power to &quot;clean&quot;, filtered DC in an external adapter, at a safe distance from noise-sensitive circuitry.
* Weight and size reduction – Removing power components and the mains connection plug from equipment powered by rechargeable batteries reduces the weight and size which must be carried.
* Ease of replacement – Power supplies are more prone to failure than other circuitry due to their exposure to power spikes and their internal generation of waste heat. External power supplies can be replaced quickly by a user without the need to have the powered device repaired.

* Configuration versatility – Externally powered electronic products can be used with different power sources as needed (e.g. 120 VAC, 240 VAC, 12 VDC, or external battery pack), for convenient use in the field, or when traveling.
* Simplified product inventory, distribution, and certification – An electronic product that is sold and used internationally must be powered from a wide range of power sources, and must meet product safety regulations in many jurisdictions, usually requiring expensive certification by national or regional safety agencies such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or TÜV. A single version of a device may be used in many markets, with the different power requirements met by different external power supplies, so that only one version of the device need be manufactured, stocked, and tested. If the design of the device is modified over time (a frequent occurrence), the power supply design itself need not be retested (and vice versa).
*Constant voltage is produced by a specific type of adapter used for computers and laptops. These types of adapters are commonly known as eliminators.

==Problems==
A survey of consumers showed widespread dissatisfaction with the cost, inconvenience, and wastefulness of the profusion of power adapters used by electronic devices.

==Efficiency==
The issue of inefficiency of some power supplies has become well known, with U.S. president George W. Bush referring in 2001 to such devices as &quot;Energy Vampires&quot;. Legislation is being enacted in the EU and a number of U.S. states to reduce the level of energy wasted by some of these devices. Such initiatives include standby power and the One Watt Initiative.

But others have argued that these inefficient devices are low-powered, e.g., devices that are used for small battery chargers, so even if they have a low efficiency, the amount of energy they waste is less than 1% of household consumption of electric energy.

Considering the total efficiency of power supplies for small electronic equipment, the older mains-frequency linear transformer-based power supply was found in a 2002 report to have efficiencies from 20 to 75%, and have considerable energy loss even when powered up but not supplying power. Switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) are much more efficient; a good design can be 80–90% efficient, and is also much smaller and lighter. In 2002 most external plug-in &quot;wall wart&quot; power adapters commonly used for low-power consumer electronics devices were of linear design, as well as supplies built into some equipment.

External supplies are usually left plugged in even when not in use, and consume from a few watts to 35 watts of power in that state. The report concluded that about 32 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, about 1% of total electrical energy consumption, could be saved in the United States by replacing all linear power supplies (average efficiency 40–50%) with advanced switching designs (efficiency 80–90%), by replacing older switching supplies (efficiencies of less than 70%) with advanced designs (efficiency of at least 80%), and by reducing standby consumption of supplies to not more than 1 watt.

Since the report was published, SMPSs have indeed replaced linear supplies to a great extent, even in wall warts. The 2002 report estimated that 6% of electrical energy used in the U.S. &quot;flows through&quot; power supplies (not counting only the wall warts). The website where the report was published said in 2010 that despite the spread of SMPSs, &quot;today&#x27;s power supplies consume at least 2% of all U.S. electricity production. More efficient power supply designs could cut that usage in half&quot;.

Since wasted electrical energy is released as heat, an inefficient power supply is hot to the touch, as is one that wastes power without an electrical load. This waste heat is itself a problem in warm weather, since it may require additional air conditioning to prevent overheating, and even to remove the unwanted heat from large supplies.

==Universal power adapters==

External power adapters can fail, or can become separated from the product they are intended to power. Consequently, there is a market for replacement adapters. The replacement must match input and output voltages, match or exceed current capability, and be fitted with a matching connector. Many electrical products are poorly labeled with information concerning the power supply they require, so it is prudent to record the specifications of the original power supply in advance, to ease replacement if the original is later lost. Careful labeling of power adapters can also reduce the likelihood of a mixup which could cause equipment damage.

Some &quot;universal&quot; replacement power supplies allow output voltage and polarity to be switched to match a range of equipment. With the advent of switch-mode supplies, adapters which can work with any voltage from 110 VAC to 240 VAC became widely available; previously either 100–120 VAC or 200–240 VAC versions were used. Adapters which can also be used with motor vehicle and aircraft power &quot;(see EmPower)&quot; are available.

Four-way X connectors or six-way star connectors, also known as spider connectors, with multiple plug sizes and types are common on generic power supplies. Other replacement power supplies have arrangements for changing the power connector, with four to nine different alternatives available when purchased in a set. This allows many different configurations of AC adapters to be put together, without requiring soldering. Philmore and other competing brands offer similar AC adapters with interchangeable connectors.

The label on a power supply may not be a reliable guide to the actual voltage it supplies under varying conditions. Many low-cost power supplies are &quot;unregulated&quot;, in that their voltage can change considerably with load. If they are lightly loaded, they may put out much more than the nominal &quot;name plate&quot; voltage, which could damage the load. If they are heavily loaded, the output voltage may droop appreciably, in some cases well below the nominal label voltage even within the nominal rated current, causing the equipment being supplied to malfunction or be damaged. Supplies with linear (as against switched) regulators are heavy, bulky, and expensive.

Modern switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) are smaller, lighter, and more efficient. They put out a much more constant voltage than unregulated supplies as the input voltage and the load current vary. When introduced, their prices were high, but by the early 21st century the prices of switch-mode components had dropped to a degree which allowed even cheap supplies to use this technology, saving the cost of a larger and heavier mains-frequency transformer.

===Auto-sensing adapters===
Some universal adapters automatically set their output voltage and maximum current according to which of a range of interchangeable tips is fitted; tips are available to fit and supply appropriate power to many notebook computers and mobile devices. Different tips may use the same connector, but automatically supply different power; it is essential to use the right tip for the apparatus being powered, but no switch needs to be set correctly by the user. The advent of switch-mode power supplies has allowed adapters to work from any AC mains supply from 100 to 240 V with an appropriate plug; operation from standard 12 V DC vehicle and aircraft supplies can also be supported. With the appropriate adapter, accessories, and tips, a variety of equipment can be powered from almost any source of power.

A &quot;Green Plug&quot; system has been proposed, based on USB technology, by which the consuming device would tell the external power supply what kind of power is needed.

=== Battery eliminator ===

A battery eliminator is an adapter intended to allow a device intended for battery operation, such as a radio, to be operated from an AC outlet.

All radios, except crystal sets, used inconvenient and messy vacuum tube batteries until the mid- to late-1920s. Battery eliminators that plugged into light sockets became very popular. Early commercial units were produced by the Edward S. Rogers, Sr. company in 1925 as a complement to its line of batteryless radios. Another early producer of battery eliminators was the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation (later known as Motorola), which was opened on September 25, 1928 by Paul Galvin and his brother Joseph E. Galvin. Eliminators became obsolete for radios after RCA introduced AC tubes in 1927, enabling receivers to plug into household power. The industry rapidly adopted AC tubes, and companies which launched exclusively manufacture that product such as Philco had to quickly pivot to radio manufacturing to remain relevant and existent. 

===Laptop charger===
In early laptop computers, the power supply units were internal like in desktop computers. To facilitate portability by sparing physical space and reducing the weight, power supply units were externalized.

When a laptop computer is operated while recharging, the integrated circuitry which controls the charging makes use of a power supply unit&#x27;s remaining electrical current capacity. This allows supplying the device&#x27;s components with power during usage while maintaining an uncompromised constant charging speed.

==Use of USB==

The USB connector (and voltage) has emerged as a de facto standard in low-power AC adapters for many portable devices. In addition to serial digital data exchange, the USB standard also provides , up to ( over USB 3.0). Numerous accessory gadgets (&quot;USB decorations&quot;) were designed to connect to USB only for DC power and not for data interchange. The USB Implementers Forum in March, 2007 released the USB Battery Charging Specification which defines, &quot;...limits as well as detection, control and reporting mechanisms to permit devices to draw current in excess of the USB 2.0 specification for charging ...&quot;. Electric fans, lamps, alarms, coffee warmers, battery chargers, and even toys have been designed to tap power from a USB connector. Plug-in adapters equipped with USB receptacles are widely available to convert or power or automotive power to USB power (see photo at right).

The trend towards more-compact electronic devices has driven a shift towards the micro-USB and mini-USB connectors, which are electrically compatible in function to the original USB connector but physically smaller.

In 2012, a USB Power Delivery Specification was proposed to standardize delivery of up to 100 watts, suitable for devices such as laptop computers that usually depend on proprietary adapters.

==Standards==
The ITU published Recommendation ITU-T L.1000, &quot;Universal power adapter and charger solution for mobile terminals and other hand-held ICT devices&quot;, which specifies a charger similar in most respects to that of the GSMA/OMTP proposal and to the European Common external power supply. The ITU recommendation was expanded and updated in June, 2011. The hope is to markedly reduce the profusion of non-interchangeable power adapters.

The European Union defined a Common external power supply for &quot;hand-held data-enabled mobile phones&quot; (smartphones) sold from 2010, intended to replace the many incompatible proprietary power supplies and eliminate waste by reducing the total number of supplies manufactured. Conformant supplies deliver 5 VDC via a micro-USB connector, with preferred input voltage handled ranging from 90 to 264 VAC.

In 2006 Larry Page, a founder of Google, proposed a and up to standard for almost all equipment requiring an external converter, with new buildings fitted with wiring, making external AC-to-DC adapter circuitry unnecessary.

IEC has created a standard for interchangeable laptop power supplies, IEC 62700 
(full name &quot;IEC Technical Specification 62700: DC Power supply for notebook computer&quot;), which was published on February 6, 2014.

<text>Peschiera del Garda (; ; , &quot;Arilica&quot;) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Verona, in Veneto, Italy. When Lombardy-Venetia was under Austrian rule, Peschiera was the northwest anchor of the four fortified towns constituting the Quadrilatero. The fortress is on an island in the river Mincio at its outlet from Lake Garda.

The town is encircled by massive Venetian defensive systems that have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 9 July 2017.

==History==

Roman Ardelica was a town of Gallia Transpadana that occupied the site of the modern Peschiera del Garda, at the southeast angle of the Lacus Benacus (Lago di Garda), just where the Mincius (modern Mincio) issued from the lake. The name is found under the corrupted form Ariolica in the Tabula Peutingeriana, which correctly places it between Brixia and Verona; the true form is preserved by inscriptions, of which one says that it was a trading place, with a corporation of ship-owners, &quot;collegium naviculariorum Ardelicensium&quot;. (Orell. Inscr. 4108.) The town is mentioned as Arilica in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

The fortress at Peschiera played a prominent part in most military campaigns conducted in northern Italy after 1400, especially during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At the Battle of Peschiera fought on 6 August 1796, the day after the major French victory at the Battle of Castiglione, a French force commanded by general Masséna drove out the Austrians. After the Siege of Peschiera, during the First Italian War of Independence, it was taken by the Piedmontese from the Austrians, following a gallant defence by general Rath lasting six weeks, on 30 May, 1848.

During World War I, the Peschiera conference between the British and French premiers and the Italian king took place on 8 November 1917.

Peschiera del Garda was also known for its military jail, which closed in 2002.

The commune is part of the Associazione Città del vino (&quot;Association of Wine Cities&quot;).

In winter, the nearby Laghetto del Frassino is the most important habitat for tufted ducks in Italy (Morbioli &amp; Sighele 2006).

==World Heritage Site==
*It is home to one or more prehistoric pile-dwelling (or stilt house) settlements that are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps UNESCO World Heritage Site.
** location Belvedere ;
** location lake of Frassino ;

*The fortress and the external fortifications. They were included in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list as part of &quot;Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar&quot; in 2017.

==Main sights==

*Sanctuary of &quot;Madonna del Frassino&quot; (1511). It houses works by Paolo Farinati and Zeno da Verona.

==Transport==

Peschiera del Garda railway station, opened in 1854, forms part of the Milan–Venice railway.
The town is additionally served by ferry services, which connect it to other towns on the coast of Lake Garda, including Sirmione and Desenzano del Garda.

<text>Microrebooting is a technique used to recover from failures in crash-only software systems. Instead of rebooting the whole system, only subsets of fine-grain components are restarted. The granularity of components is typically finer than the process level (e.g., EJB-level in Java EE systems).

The goal of confining the reboot to fine-grain components is threefold: to reduce the amount of time it takes for the system to return to service, to minimize the failure&#x27;s disruption to the system and its users, and to preserve as much in-memory application data as possible.

The concept was proposed in 2001 by George Candea and Armando Fox, while the former was a graduate student at Stanford University. It was initially reduced to practice in systems such as a satellite ground station control system and a Java EE application server; later on it formed the basis of the design of commercial systems like Aster Data Systems nCluster.

<text>Neumünster () is a city in the middle of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. With more than 79,000 registered inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest municipality in Schleswig-Holstein (behind Kiel, Lübeck and Flensburg). The &quot;Holstenhallen&quot; and the &quot;Stadthalle&quot; make the city an important trade fair location.

==History==
The city was first formally mentioned as &quot;Wippendorp im Gau Faldera&quot; in 1127. In that year, the Bishop Vicelinus was sent there by the Archbishop of Bremen to perform missionary work. By 1136, Vicelinus built a new monastery there (Latin: &quot;novum monasterium,&quot; Greco-Latin&quot;: Neomonasterium,&quot; German&quot;: neues Kloster&quot; or &quot;neues Münster&quot;). The name &quot;Novum monasterium&quot; eventually replaced the previous names of Wippendorf and Faldera and led to the current name.

In April 1870, Neumünster received town privileges. Since 1903 Neumünster is a so-called &quot;independent city&quot; (German: &quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) as it is not part of a district (German: &quot;Kreis&quot;).

Großflecken (English: Large spot), a large, centrally-located street and public space in the city, became a place for civil unrest several times. In March 1848, riots broke out at Großflecken as part of the German revolution and again in 1923 during a period of inflation.

The city was criticized by the Rural People&#x27;s Movement as part of a farmers&#x27; protest movement in northern Germany from 1928 to 1933, which was the basis for Hans Fallada&#x27;s novel &quot;A Small Circus (Bauern, Bonzen und Bomben).&quot; The city&#x27;s Hans Fallada Prize is named after him.

The Schleswig-Holstein Nazi Party was founded in 1925 by Hinrich Lohse. The local Nazi Party group of Neumünster met at &quot;Hofbräu München,&quot; a brewery at Großflecken&quot;.&quot; In 1926, Joseph Goebbels spoke to the local members there. In 1929 there were reportedly 29 members of the local Nazi Party group, but this number increased to 400 members a year later and to over 2,000 members by 1932. Shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, Großflecken was renamed to Adolf-Hitler-Platz (English: Adolf Hitler Place). On Kristallnacht in 1938, all Jewish men were arrested and sent to KZ Sachsenhausen.

During World War 2, Neumünster was bombed multiple times by Allied forces in 1945, partly because of its importance as a railway junction and industrial city. The British took control of the City in May 1945.

In the fall of 1946, the state of Schleswig-Holstein was founded and postwar Neumünster held its first municipal election.

Neumünster used to be a hub for the textile industry, with its first fulling mill going back to 1566. However, the industry eventually left the city due to competition from overseas and Neumünster&#x27;s last cloth factory closed in the beginning of the 1990s. This, among other reasons, led to Neumünster having a relatively high rate of unemployment compared to nationwide averages.

In 2012, McArthurGlen Group opened a designer outlet shopping center in the industrial section of the city, using approximately 15,000 square meters.

==Current infrastructure==
The city is divided into nine neighborhoods: Böcklersiedlung-Bugenhagen, Brachenfeld-Rutenberg, Einfeld, Faldera, Gadeland, Gartenstadt, Stadtmitte, Tungendorf and Wittorf.

Neumünster station is a major railway junction with lines running in six (formerly seven) directions, including the important Hamburg-Altona–Kiel and Neumünster–Flensburg lines.

Near Neumünster at Ehndorf, there is a high-power medium wave transmission facility for transmitting the programmes of Deutschlandfunk, the Ehndorf transmitter, which is often named incorrectly as &quot;Neumünster transmitter&quot;.

The city has an airfield and a hospital. The utility company, &quot;Stadtwerke Neumünster&quot; (SWN), also manages local inter-city bus routes. In 2022, SWN ended all its inter-city bus service for Sundays and holidays, instead offering an on-demand shuttle van requiring an additional &quot;comfort surcharge&quot; on top of regular bus fares. Beginning in autumn 2023 more regular bus lines were replaced by the on-demand shuttle service. The additional fees were cancelled and the service can now be used with the normal bus tickets.

=== Education ===
The University of Applied Sciences Kiel offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in nursing at its Neumünster site.

==Geography==

Neumünster is located at the rivers Schwale and Stör, near the geographical center of Schleswig-Holstein, south of Kiel, north of Hamburg and west of Lübeck. The Aukrug Nature Park is close to the town.

== Culture and Sightseeing ==

=== Museums and artists&#x27; house ===
The &quot;Museum Tuch + Technik&quot; shows the history of the cloth-making craft from the Iron Age to the present day as well as of the city of Neumünster. The museum, which is supported by the Foundation Museum, Art and Culture of the City of Neumünster, was reopened on October 13, 2007 with a revised exhibition in a specially constructed building.

The &quot;Herbert Gerisch Foundation&quot; is an art foundation established in 2001 by Brigitte and Herbert Gerisch and based in Neumünster-Brachenfeld. The foundation serves the care, promotion and presentation of regional as well as international contemporary art. At the same time as the foundation was established, an international sculpture park was continuously built up.

The &quot;Keramikkünstlerhaus Neumünster&quot; (until 2022 Stadttöpferei Neumünster) is an artists&#x27; house in Neumünster, which has been awarding work and residency scholarships for outstanding international graduates in the field of artistic ceramics since 1987. The Keramikkünstlerhaus is located in the Fürsthof, a small street in Neumünster&#x27;s historic city center. The three-story brick building was built around 1900.

=== Zoo ===
The &quot;Tierpark Neumünster&quot; houses about 700 animals from a total of 100 species of mammals, birds and reptiles on a wooded area of 24 hectares.

=== Nature reserves ===
The raised bog Dosenmoor near Einfeld northeast of Neumünster has an area of 521 hectares and is the largest and best preserved raised bog in Schleswig-Holstein. Due to the good condition of the moor, a diverse flora and fauna can be explored here.

The nature reserve on the western shore of Einfelder See protects the near-natural shoreline landscape with siltation zones and the open water areas in front of them.

<doc id="1169485" wikidata="Q1138960" url="?curid=1169485" title="Crash (The Human League album)">
<text>Crash is the fifth studio album by English synth-pop band the Human League, released on 8 September 1986 by Virgin Records. The album would provide the band with their second US number-one single, &quot;Human&quot;, the same year. It was produced by the American production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who also wrote several tracks.

==Background==
After spending two years recording their fourth album &quot;Hysteria&quot;, which met with only moderate commercial success, the band struggled to record further material. They recorded some new material with producer Colin Thurston in Utopia Studios in London, who previously worked with them on the &quot;Reproduction&quot; album. However, the slow progress in the studio was wearing his patience thin, so once he left for his honeymoon he let his assistant Paul Rabiger take over the rest of the sessions, who would be credited for keyboards and arrangements on the final album. By 1985, musician/songwriter Jo Callis had left the group. Virgin Records, worried by the lack of progress in one of their leading acts, called the band principals to a meeting where a solution was sought. As the problem was perceived to be the lack of production, it was suggested that the band take up an offer to work with Minneapolis-based production duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Jam and Lewis had written for and produced the S.O.S. Band, Cherrelle and Alexander O&#x27;Neal, and had just finished working on Janet Jackson&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Control&quot;. They had developed an interest in the Human League after the success of their US releases; they were also seeking an opportunity to cross over into mainstream pop and saw the Human League as the perfect opportunity.

In February 1986, the Human League flew to Minneapolis to work at Flyte Time Studios with Jam and Lewis. After initial enthusiasm on both sides, the working relationship began to break down. Jam and Lewis had total control over the final album and insisted that their own tracks take precedence over the band&#x27;s material. Jam and Lewis were also intolerant of the band&#x27;s laid-back working methods and lack of musical technical ability. The basic arrangements for the band&#x27;s material were worked out in England using sequencers, which Jam and Lewis had re-cut with the parts all played by hand for a more natural feel: the liner notes reinforce that &quot;there are no sequencers on this album.&quot;

After four months in Minneapolis, a sidelined Philip Oakey pulled the band out of further recording. They returned to Sheffield leaving Jam and Lewis to complete the album using session musicians. Oakey said later:

Keyboard players Philip Adrian Wright and Ian Burden also had been sidelined by Jam and Lewis. &quot;I really wished we were back in Berkshire &quot;(where Dare was recorded)&quot; with Martin Rushent, making a Human League album,&quot; Burden recalled. &quot;It was gratifying to get a US number one with &#x27;Human&#x27;, but otherwise the album was a crashing bore in every sense.&quot; Wright would not recover from the humiliation and left the band upon their return to the UK. Burden eventually quit in 1987.

The album name was taken from a moment in the studio during the recording. Oakey described it thus:

The album quickly became an unexpected success. One of Jam and Lewis&#x27;s compositions, &quot;Human&quot;, became the Human League&#x27;s second number-one single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and their first UK top 10 single in over three years, peaking at number eight. Follow-ups &quot;I Need Your Loving&quot; and the 1988 release &quot;Love Is All That Matters&quot; were less successful, failing to reach the UK top 40. The album itself peaked at number seven in the UK (where it has been certified Gold for shipments in excess of 100,000 copies) and number 24 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Oakey stated his discomfort with the record in 1995, saying: &quot;The Jam and Lewis album [Crash] was just like being a puppet for four months. It was interesting to pick yourself out of the industrial north of England and dump yourself in Minneapolis. Great experience, but it just wasn&#x27;t our album.&quot;

However, in 2015, producer Jimmy Jam mentioned that the primary source of tension between the Human League and Jam and Lewis was the issue of background vocals. Jam thought Sulley and Catherall were good singers, but wanted to use them for the spoken parts on &quot;Human&quot;. Jam and Lewis brought in their session vocalist Lisa Keith, who – with Lewis – performed the background vocals. This caused a rift between the producers and the group, which was started by Catherall who was discussing the issue with Oakey at the time of recording. Catherall did not like the idea of another female voice on the album, while Jam and Lewis thought Keith&#x27;s vocals added to the songs. Jam explained:

In 2005, &quot;Crash&quot; was re-issued with extended versions of the three singles.

== Artwork ==
The out-of-focus cover photo was used to disguise the fact that it was taken at very short notice to meet a print deadline, after the disaster of the planned original photo shoot. Oakey originally wanted to return to the &quot;Vogue&quot; cover style of &quot;Dare&quot; artwork for &quot;Crash&quot;. He had persuaded Virgin Records to finance a studio photo shoot of the band with &quot;Vogue&quot; Paris-based photographer Guy Bourdin. The band were flown out to Paris for the two-day photo sessions. However, on arriving at Bourdin&#x27;s studio, it became apparent that he was only interested in photographing the two female vocalists Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall. Matters came to a head when Bourdin ordered Sulley to do a handstand wearing a mini-skirt, a pose she considered inappropriate. After she turned on Bourdin and the two clashed angrily, the photographer refused to work with the band and they walked out of the session with the loss of all fees. Oakey would later comment that &quot;we spent two days there, it took nine hours to set up one photograph and I daren&#x27;t tell you how much money we spent.&quot;

==Reception==

Ken Tucker of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave the album a two stars out of four rating, stating that the group&#x27;s collaboration with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis &quot;should have been exciting, but instead they are merely fitfully enjoyable since the melodies are wispy and the vocals weak.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann considered &quot;Crash&quot; a collection of &quot;songs with appealing backing tracks that maintained their dance appeal while eschewing the overtly synthesized sound of previous albums&quot;, which made it &quot;an improvement over the lackluster &quot;Hysteria&quot;, but still not on a par with &quot;Dare&quot;.&quot; 

In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, in a review of the Human League&#x27;s entire discography at the time, &quot;Crash&quot; was noted for featuring two sounds, one praised for &quot;sounding like the Human League of yore, albeit with a better rhythm section&quot;, and the other criticised for &quot;coming across like contemporary R&amp;B sung by the generally soulless Oakey, Sulley, and Catherall.&quot; Of the album&#x27;s ten tracks, the lead single &quot;Human&quot; was called a highlight for &quot;find[ing] the perfect middle ground [between the two sounds]&quot;.

<doc id="1169486" wikidata="Q513072" url="?curid=1169486" title="Chinese water torture">
<text>Chinese water torture, or use of a dripping machine, is a mentally painful process in which cold water is slowly dripped onto the scalp, forehead or face for a prolonged period of time. The process causes fear and mental deterioration of the subject. The pattern of the drops is often irregular, and the cold sensation is jarring, which causes anxiety as a person tries to anticipate the next drip.

Despite the name, it is not a Chinese invention and it is not traditional anywhere in Asia. Its earliest known version was first documented by Hippolytus de Marsiliis in Bologna (now in Italy) in the late 15th or early 16th century, and it was widely used in Western countries before being popularized by Harry Houdini in the early 20th century.

==Origin==
&quot;Chinese water torture&quot; is mentioned in the 1884 short story &quot;The Compromiser&quot; suggesting some public familiarity with the term by that date. It might have been popularised by the predicament escape Chinese Water Torture Cell (a feat of escapology introduced in Berlin at Circus Busch on September 13, 1910). The escape entailed Harry Houdini being bound and suspended upside-down in a locked glass and steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, from which he escaped. There were also the Fu Manchu stories by Sax Rohmer that were popular in the 1930s (in which Fu Manchu subjected his victims to various ingenious tortures, such as the wired jacket).

Hippolytus de Marsiliis is credited with the invention of a form of water torture. Having observed how drops of water falling one by one on a stone gradually created a hollow, he applied the method to the human body. Other suggestions say that the term &quot;Chinese water torture&quot; was invented merely to grant the method a sense of ominous mystery. The victim would be stripped of their clothes, shown to the public, and then tortured. They would be driven insane while bystanders watched, mocked, and laughed at them.

The victims could see each drop coming and, after a long duration of time, were gradually driven frantic to the point of insanity, usually because they were led to believe that a hollow or severe ulcer would develop there, or as a (sometimes combined) result of prolonged restraint under irritating conditions, isolation, or the humiliation of being tortured publicly. 

==Effectiveness==
There is very little evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of torture for interrogation purposes. The method itself causes lasting mental damage in victims proportional to the intensity of exposure. The television series &quot;MythBusters&quot; investigated the effectiveness of Chinese water torture, and while it was found quite effective in producing distress, they noted that the restraining equipment was providing most of the effect by itself. When testing the dripping water alone on a relaxed, unrestrained subject, it was found almost negligible. Nevertheless, in the Episode 3, Season 2 of the web television series &quot;Mind Field&quot; the &quot;MythBusters&quot; host Adam Savage said the following: &quot;The creepiest thing that happened after we did this episode was that I got an e-mail from someone from a throwaway account. He said &#x27;We found that randomizing when the drops occurred was incredibly effective.&#x27; That anything that happens on a regular periodicity can become a type of meditation and you can then tune it out. If you couldn’t predict it, [...] he said, &#x27;we found we were able to induce a psychotic break within twenty hours.&#x27;.&quot;

In addition to the victims experiencing mental deterioration, psychosis is a common side effect when undergoing the Chinese water torture. During the psychosis episode, victims experience delusions, hallucinations, and losing touch with reality. In 2012, Australian artist Lottie Consalvo performed the Chinese water torture for an art project, &quot;Steer a Steady Ship&quot;, to represent her emotions after her sister&#x27;s passing. Whilst lying under the drips of water, she felt the presence of her deceased sister lying beside her. In the article that explains Consalvo&#x27;s experience during the performance,&quot;Australian Artist Recreates Chinese Water Torture&quot;, the author states, &quot;She came to the idea of Chinese water torture, which can cause psychosis, through its association with the head, which for her represents the physicality of the mindsomething she believes is &#x27;more physical than anything in life&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="1169490" wikidata="Q2165627" url="?curid=1169490" title="Sunbeam Motor Car Company">
<text>Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited was a British automobile manufacturer in operation between 1905 and 1934. Its works were at Moorfields in Blakenhall, a suburb of Wolverhampton in Staffordshire, now West Midlands. The Sunbeam name had originally been registered by John Marston in 1888 for his bicycle manufacturing business. Sunbeam motor car manufacture began in 1901. The motor business was sold to a newly incorporated Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited in 1905 to separate it from Marston&#x27;s pedal bicycle business; Sunbeam motorcycles were not made until 1912.

In-house designer Louis Coatalen had an enthusiasm for motor racing and accumulated expertise with engines. Sunbeam manufactured their own aero engines during the First World War and 647 aircraft to the designs of other manufacturers. Engines drew Sunbeam into Grand Prix racing and participation in the achievement of world land speed records.

In spite of its well-regarded cars and aero engines, by 1934 a long period of particularly slow sales had brought continuing losses. Sunbeam was unable to repay money borrowed for ten years in 1924 to fund its Grand Prix racing programme, and a receiver was appointed. There was a forced sale, and Sunbeam was picked up by the Rootes brothers. Manufacture of Sunbeam&#x27;s then old-fashioned cars did not resume under the new owners, but Sunbeam trolleybuses remained in production.

The two Rootes brothers had intended to sell luxury cars under the Sunbeam name, but by 1938 instead chose to add the name to their Talbot branded range of Rootes designs, calling them Sunbeam-Talbots. In 1954 they dropped Talbot from the name.

Sunbeam continued to appear as a marque name on new cars until 1976. It was then used as a model name, firstly for the Chrysler Sunbeam from 1977 to 1979, and, following the takeover of Chrysler Europe by PSA Group, for the Talbot Sunbeam from 1979 through to its discontinuation in 1981.

==Ownership==
===John Marston===
John Marston, the London-educated son of a sometime mayor of Ludlow and landowner, had been apprenticed to Edward Perry, tinplate-works master and twice mayor of Wolverhampton. In 1859 aged 23 Marston bought two other tinplate manufacturers in Bilston, four miles away, and set himself up on his own account. On Perry&#x27;s death Marston bought his Jeddo Works in Paul Street Wolverhampton, left Bilston and continued Perry&#x27;s business.

An avid cyclist he established his Sunbeamland Cycle Factory in 1897 in his Paul Street premises manufacturing and assembling pedal bicycles he branded Sunbeam. His Sunbeam trademark was registered in 1893. In 1895 a company, John Marston Limited, was incorporated and took ownership of John Marston&#x27;s business. The Sunbeam trademark was registered for motor-cars in 1900.

Rugby-educated Thomas Cureton (1863–1921) began as his apprentice then became Marston&#x27;s right-hand man in the cycle works and the cautious advocate of a motor-car venture. Their board of directors did not favour it but Marston and Cureton continued their project. Between 1899 and 1901 Sunbeam produced a number of experimental cars driven about Wolverhampton but none was offered for sale. In late 1900 they announced the purchase in Blakenhall of &quot;a large area of land in Upper Villiers Street for the erection of works for the manufacture of cars&quot; alongside the premises of Marston&#x27;s Villiers Engineering business. The first announcement of their new autocar was on 22 September 1900 issue of &quot;The Autocar&quot; but no full description was provided to the public until February 1901. It would be supplied with a 2-seater body on a channel steel frame powered by a 4-horsepower horizontal engine with electric ignition intended to run at 700 rpm and have two forward speeds and reverse using belt drive to differential gears on the live axle. Dimensions: weight 10 cwt, overall measurements 84 inches by 57 inches.

====Cyclecar====
The first production car branded Sunbeam was not Marston and Cureton&#x27;s but a car designed and developed by a young architect, Maxwell Mabberly-Smith, powered by a single-cylinder 2 horsepower De Dion engine. Described as a &quot;sociable&quot; it carried two passengers sitting close together facing the roadside from above a central belt-drive. To begin with they faced opposite roadsides. This layout provided propinquity while maintaining propriety. Their driver at his tiller sat behind them his body facing the opposite roadside. Wheels were arranged in a diamond formation. They used a frame like a motorised quadracycle version of Starley&#x27;s Coventry Rotary and were to be referred to by &quot;The Automotor Journal&quot; as &quot;the curiously light vehicles with which their (Sunbeam) name has for some time been associated&quot;. The Sunbeam Mabley was a limited success, several hundred sold in 1901 and 1902 at £130. More stock was still in the Sunbeam catalogue in early 1904 with the following specification: single cylinder 74 x 76 mm. 327 cc engine designed to run at 1,800 rpm, 2-speed gearbox, central wheels driven by belt then chain drives from the differential. Weight 4 cwt. Price £120

====Motorcar====

At the annual Stanley Cycle Show in November 1902 Sunbeam, thoroughly approved by the magazine&#x27;s correspondent, displayed beside more Mableys a 12-horsepower four-cylinder car with the engine beneath a bonnet at the front, camshaft within the &quot;crank chamber&quot;, a four-speed gearbox and all four artillery wheels of the same size fitted with pneumatic tyres. Price 500 guineas or £525. Listed in February 1904 its specification was: four cylinders 80 × 120 mm. 1527 cc engine designed to run at 1,000 rpm, four-speed gearbox, rear wheels driven by chain drives from the differential. Weight 16 cwt. Price £512.

In February 1904 the 12-horsepower car was given a six-cylinder 16-horsepower stablemate. Like the 12 the new engine was designed to give its full power at what were even then considered low engine speeds. Particular note was made that special attention had once more been paid to further controlling the airflow beneath the car&#x27;s apron and the chassis to reduce that bane of passengers&#x27; comfort, the car&#x27;s disturbance of dust on the road. The new car also featured chain cases so the chains ran in oil, were rendered almost silent and were protected from dirt.

====Thomas Pullinger====
London-born Thomas Charles Willis Pullinger (1866–1945) joined Sunbeam in 1902. He had repaired, then made bicycles, and then in 1891 was sent by Humber to France for Humber&#x27;s joint venture with Gladiator but Humber struck difficulties and Pullinger stayed in France with Alexandre Darracq as Darracq&#x27;s designer and personal assistant. He moved on as works manager to other French firms, designing perhaps the first small car and certainly designing the first water-cooled cylinder head. Very keen to design and build his own car, he moved back to England and arrived at Sunbeam in Wolverhampton on a motor-quadracycle he had built himself. He prepared a report for the Sunbeam directors and delivered it on 11 November 1902. His first recommendation was that Sunbeam should buy-in a car from an established firm, then as sales built-up, buy them without certain components which would instead be made by Sunbeam until all that was bought in would be an engine. The report concluded with his advice that the cars should be supplied to Sunbeam by Berliet. He also advised the remaining stock of Mabley cars should be sold off as quickly as possible. A decision was made to sell shares in the company to the general public. Some of the board approved because they could see much growth ahead, some only because they wanted other people to come in to cut back on their own risk. On 31 January 1905 the architect signed the plans for the new motorcar buildings on the land in Upper Villiers Street.

===Sunbeam Motor Car Company===
In January 1905, the Sunbeam Motor Car Company Ltd was formed to purchase and remove motor cars and their Villiers Street Works from the rest of the John Marston business which retained Sunbeam Cycles. Six years later after several further issues of shares to provide capital for greater expansion there was a (technically) public offer of ordinary and preference shares to Sunbeam agents and their customers representing a small part of the company&#x27;s capital. Twelve months later in January 1912 its shares were formally listed on the London Stock Exchange and Sunbeam became a public listed company.

====Louis Coatalen====

The Breton car designer, Louis Coatalen, joined Sunbeam from Hillman-Coatalen in 1909, and became chief designer. He soon reorganised production so almost all parts were built in-house instead of relying on outside suppliers with their variable quality. He quickly introduced his first design, the Sunbeam 14/20, their first to use a shaft-driven rear axle. It was upgraded in 1911 with a slightly larger engine and rebranded 16/20.

Coatalen also designed a number of passenger cars, notably the Sunbeam 12–16. By 1911 Sunbeam were building about 650 cars a year and were regarded as a substantial motor manufacturer. Wolseley sold 3,000 cars of similar quality in 1913. Ford sold 6,000 Model Ts that same year assembled at Trafford Park, Manchester. In 1914 Ford switched on Britain&#x27;s first moving assembly line for car production and it began its run at a rate of 21 cars an hour.

====First World War====
=====Aero engines=====
In 1912 they began to make aircraft engines introducing a series of engines that were not a commercial success. Coatalen seemed to believe the proper solution was a bespoke design for an aircraft designer&#x27;s requirements instead of designing and producing a successful engine to let the aircraft designers build their aircraft around it. Sunbeam&#x27;s designs included the troublesome V8 Sunbeam Arab, which was ordered in quantity in 1917 but suffered from continual vibration and reliability problems and only saw limited service and the more successful V12 Sunbeam Cossack. Meanwhile, Coatalen continued to experiment with ever-more odd designs such as the star-layout Sunbeam Malay, which never got beyond a prototype, the air-cooled Sunbeam Spartan and the diesel-powered Sunbeam Pathan. However Sunbeam was successful with the introduction of newer manufacturing techniques and became one of the first to build aluminium single-block engines, a design that would not become common until the 1930s.
=====Vehicles and aircraft=====
During the First World War Sunbeam built trucks and ambulances. It also participated in the Society of British Aircraft Constructors pool which shared aircraft designs with anyone that could build them. In this role Sunbeam produced 15 Short Bombers powered by their own Sunbeam Gurkha engines, 20 Short Type 827s, 50 Short 310s, and others including Avro 504 trainers; they even designed their own Sunbeam Bomber, which lost to a somewhat simpler Sopwith design. Sunbeam had produced 647 aircraft of various types by the time the lines shut down in early 1919.

=====End of an era and sale to Darracq=====
Marston&#x27;s third son, Roland, had been expected to take over as chairman of Sunbeam but he suddenly died in March 1918 and John Marston himself died the morning after Roland&#x27;s funeral. He was aged 82. Cureton was already in poor health and would die in 1921. They had made Coatalen a joint managing director in 1914 alongside William Marklew Iliff (1873–1957).

===S.T.D. Motors===

In June 1920 Darracq bought Wolverhampton&#x27;s Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited. In 1919, following the First World War, Darracq had bought a London motor manufacturer, Clément-Talbot. The Sunbeam Talbot and Darracq businesses retained their separate identities. The Sunbeam car would continue to be made at Moorfield Works, Wolverhampton, the Talbot in North Kensington and the Darracq at Suresnes with central buying, selling, administration and advertising departments with S T D in Britain On 13 August 1920 Darracq changed its name to S T D Motors Limited. The initials represented Sunbeam, Talbot and Darracq.

S.T.D. Motors Limited had been first incorporated in London in 1905, at that time bearing the name A Darracq and Company (1905) Limited, though it continued to manufacture its Darracq cars in Suresnes, Paris.

===Closedown and sale of brandname===
Sunbeam did not survive the Great Depression. It fell into receivership in 1934 and was sold by the receiver to the Rootes brothers.

==Products==
===Production cars===
When at its height in the 1920s, Sunbeam Motor Car Company&#x27;s Moorfield works employed 3,500 staff on their 50-acre site. The buildings covered 15 acres.

Under VSCC rules all cars made in Wolverhampton post WW1 qualify as vintage and as post-vintage thoroughbreds after 1 January 1931. All cars built before the end of the First World War are covered by the VCC.

Coatalen&#x27;s obsession with improvement meant that there were numerous small changes in models from year to year. Therefore, although his designs are basically similar, few parts are interchangeable. Two models dominated production:
* 1920–24 16 hp, 16/40, 24 hp, 24/60 and 24/70 all based on pre-war designs
* 1922–23 14 hp, the first post-war four-cylinder
* 1924 12/30 and 16/50 only produced in small numbers
* 1924–26 14/40 and big brother 20/60 developed from 14 hp with two more cylinders added.
* 1926–30 3-litre Super Sports, Sunbeam&#x27;s Bentley rival.
* 1926–30 16 hp (known as &quot;16.9&quot;) and 20 hp (known as &quot;20.9&quot;). Two new designs with six-cylinder integral cast iron block and crankcase. Both were produced over many years. The 20.9 with a 3-litre engine producing 70 bhp shared components with the 3-litre Super Sports (brakes, suspension, steering, axles, gearbox, transmission).
* 1926–32 20/60 developed into 25 hp with bore increased from 75 to 80 mm. A few 8-cylinder cars produced in this period, 30 hp &amp; 35 hp.
* 1930–32 16 hp bore increased from 67 to 70 mm, (known as &quot;18.2&quot;).
* 1931–33 New model 20 hp (known as &quot;23.8&quot;) introduced with 80 mm bore and 7 main bearings rated at 23.8 hp.
* 1933–34 New model Speed 20 consisting of 20.9 hp engine resurrected with improved exhaust manifold and downdraught carb installed in new cruciform braced chassis.
* 1933 18.2 hp engine installed in Speed 20 chassis and renamed &#x27;Twenty&#x27;.
* 1933–35 Twenty-Five introduced with modified 1931–33 23.8 hp engine.
* 1934 Twenty given the 20.9 engine in place of the 18.2.
* 1934–35 Dawn introduced. 12.8 engine and IFS.
* 1935 Speed 20 renamed Sports 21 with redesigned body style.
* 1935 Sports 21 given a high compression version of Twenty-Five engine.

The most successful, judged by volumes, was the 16 hp (16.9) followed by 20 hp (20.9) made from 1926 to 1930. Whilst the 16 was solid and very reliable, it was a little underpowered at 2.1 litres; the 20.9 made a big jump to 3 litres and with similar body weight and vacuum servo brakes and was capable of .

Sunbeam built their own bodies but also supplied to the coachbuilder trade; many limousines were built on Sunbeam chassis. The sales catalogue illustrates the standard body designs.

Financial difficulties arose in the early years of the Great Depression and just before the opening of the October 1934 Olympia Motor Show an application was made to the court for an appointment of a receiver and manager for the two major subsidiaries of S T D, Sunbeam and Automobiles Talbot France. Clément-Talbot remained profitable and was sold to the Rootes brothers. It proved impossible for the directors to avoid the appointment of a receiver to Sunbeam Motor Car Company and S T D was unable to complete its sale to Rootes. However six months later in July 1935 Rootes Securities announced they had bought Sunbeam Motor Car Company and its subsidiary Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles.


The following cars were built by Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited.

===Commercial vehicles===
====Buses====
Car production was terminated but trolleybus production continued. Karrier&#x27;s trolleybus business was moved from Huddersfield to Moorfield (not Luton with other Karrier operations) and combined with Sunbeam but the same Karrier designs were to be produced. During wartime the factory produced the only trolleybus available in the UK; a four-wheeled double decker known as either the Karrier or Sunbeam W4.

In 1946 soon after the end of the Second World War J. Brockhouse and Co Limited of West Bromwich, the engineering group, bought Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles but in September 1948 sold the trolley-bus part of the business to Guy Motors Limited. who built Sunbeam trolleybuses at their factory until the last was completed in 1964.

====Double decker buses====
* Sikh 1930–1933 (three built)
* Pathan 1930–1938 (at least four built for Woverhampton Corp)
* DF2 1936–1948 (one built for Wolverhampton Corp)

====Double decker trolleybuses====
* MS2 1934–1948
* MS3 1934–1948
* MF1 1934–1949
* MF2 1935–1952
* W4 1943–1947
* F4/F4A 1948–1965
* S7/S7A 1948–1958

====Double or single-deck trolleybus====
* MF2B 1934–65
Brisbane City Council (Australia) imported Sunbeam single-deck trolleybus chassis from 1951 until 1960. All had been withdrawn by 1969. Two of these, fleet numbers 1 (of 1951, with a body by Charles Hope of Brisbane) and 34 (of 1960, body by Athol Hedges), are preserved at the Brisbane Tramway Museum.

===Sunbeam-Coatalen aero engines===

Sunbeam, Wolverhampton, England, started to build aircraft engines in 1912. Louis Coatalen joined Sunbeam as chief engineer in 1909, having previously been Chief Engineer at the Humber works in Coventry. The company quickly became one of the UK&#x27;s leading engine manufacturers and even designed an aircraft of its own. Sunbeam discontinued the production of aero engines after Coatalen left the company in the 1930s.

===Grand Prix cars===
Sunbeam&#x27;s great era was in the 1920s under Coatalen&#x27;s leadership with well-engineered, high quality, reliable cars and a great reputation on the track.

Coatalen was pleased to build racing cars for Henry Segrave, who won the French and Spanish GPs in 1923/4. In 1921 Segrave participated in his first Grand Prix on Talbot no.10, in effect a re-badged 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam. This important straight-eight dohc, four valve per cylinder aluminium block car influenced by the great designer Ernest Henry proceeded to win the 1922 Tourist Trophy in the hands of Jean Chassagne.

A different team of 2-litre dohc 1922 Grand Prix Sunbeams designed by Ernest Henry were entered in that year&#x27;s French Grand Prix. Sunbeam also manufactured the 1923 Sunbeam Grand Prix race car.

===World land speed record cars===


He also built a Brooklands racer with a purpose-built V12 18.3-litre engine whose design was a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and the Sunbeam Arab aero engines. This engine had four blocks of three cylinders arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by a complex set of 16 gears from the front of the crankshaft – a similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. This famous car (Sunbeam 350HP) established three Land Speed Records, the first achieved by Kenelm Lee Guinness at Brooklands in 1922 with a speed of 133.75 mph. Malcolm Campbell then purchased the car, had it painted in his distinctive colour scheme, named it Blue Bird and in September 1924 achieved a new record speed of 146.16 mph at Pendine Sands in South Wales, raising it the following year to 150.76 mph. The same year Coatalen&#x27;s new 3-litre Super Sports came 2nd at Le Mans, beating Bentley – this was the first production twin-cam car in the world. In 1926 Segrave captured the LSR in a new 4-litre V12 Sunbeam racer originally named Ladybird and later renamed Tiger. Coatalen decided to re-enter the LSR field himself, building the truly gigantic Sunbeam 1000HP powered by two Matabele engines. On 29 March 1927 the car captured the speed record at . The car is now at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, UK.

A later land speed record attempt, with the 1930 Silver Bullet, failed to achieve either records, or the hoped-for advances in aero engines. It is now almost forgotten.

==Legacy==

The name lives on in the open space known as Sunbeam Gardens near a housing estate built in the early 1990s on most of the Ladbroke Grove site of the Clément-Talbot car factory. One of the original buildings remains, the Talbot administration block now known as Ladbroke Hall, with the earl&#x27;s crest high above its main entrance. In the housing area there is a Sunbeam Crescent.

==Sunbeam badged vehicles==

===Rootes Group===


Rootes was an early exponent of badge engineering, building a single mass-produced chassis and equipping it with different body panels and interiors to fit different markets. They ended production of existing models at all the new companies, replacing them with designs from Hillman and Humber that were more amenable to mass production.

Although Rootes&#x27; intention had been to continue the Sunbeam name on a large and expensive luxury car, the eight-cylinder Sunbeam 30, after almost four years it was announced Sunbeam Motors and Clement-Talbot were now combined under the ownership of Clement Talbot Limited – since renamed Sunbeam-Talbot Limited – and would produce good quality cars at reasonable prices. During 1937 Humber Limited bought Clement Talbot Limited and Sunbeam Motors Limited from Rootes Securities Limited.

In 1938 Rootes created a new marque called Sunbeam-Talbot which combined the quality Talbot coachwork and the current Hillman and Humber chassis and was assembled at the Talbot factory in London. The initial two models were the Sunbeam-Talbot 10 and the 3-litre followed by the Sunbeam-Talbot 2 Litre and 4-litre models based on the earlier models only with different engines and longer wheelbases. Production of these models continued after the war until 1948.

In the summer of 1948, the Sunbeam-Talbot 80 and Sunbeam-Talbot 90 were introduced, with a totally new streamlined design with flowing front fenders (wings). The 80 used the Hillman Minx-based engine with ohv and the 90 used a modified version of the Humber Hawk with ohv. The car bodies were manufactured by another Rootes Group company, British Light Steel Pressings of Acton, however the convertible drophead coupé shells were completed by Thrupp &amp; Maberly coachbuilders in Cricklewood. The underpowered 80 was discontinued in 1950. The 90 was renamed the 90 Mark II and then the 90 Mark IIA and eventually in 1954 the Sunbeam Mark III, finally dropping the Talbot name. With the model name changes, the headlights were raised on the front fenders and an independent coil front suspension and the engine displacement went from 1944 cc to 2267 cc with a high compression head and developing .

There was one more model of the Sunbeam-Talbot that appeared in 1953 in the form of an Alpine, a two-seater sports roadster which was initially developed by a Sunbeam-Talbot dealer George Hartwell in Bournemouth as a one-off rally car that had its beginnings as a 1952 drophead coupé. It was named supposedly by Norman Garrad, (works Competition Department) who was heavily involved in the Sunbeam-Talbot successes in the Alpine Rally in the early 1950s using the Saloon model. The Alpine Mark I and Mark III (a Mark II was never made) were hand built like the Drophead Coupé at Thrupp &amp; Maberly coachbuilders from 1953 to 1955 when production ceased after close to 3000 were produced. It has been estimated that perhaps only 200 remain in existence today. The Talbot name was dropped in 1954 for the Sunbeam Alpine sports car, making Sunbeam the sports-performance marque. In 1955 a Sunbeam saloon won the Monte Carlo Rally. Production ceased in 1956 and was replaced by the sporty Sunbeam Rapier.
In 1959 a totally new Alpine was introduced, and the 1955 Rapier (essentially a badge-engineered Hillman Minx) was upgraded. After several successful series of the Alpine were released, director of US West-Coast operations, Ian Garrad, became interested in the success of the AC Cobra, which mounted a small-block V-8 engine in the small AC Ace frame to create one of the most successful sports cars of all time. Garrad became convinced the Alpine frame could also be adapted the same way, and contracted Carroll Shelby to create a prototype with a Ford engine. The result was the Sunbeam Tiger, released in 1964, which became a success. It sold 7,000 units in its three years of production compared with 70,000 over nine years for the small-engined car.

===Chrysler Europe===
But at this point, Rootes was in financial trouble. Talks with Leyland Motors were fruitless. In 1964, 30 percent of the company (along with 50 percent of the non-voting shares) was purchased by Chrysler, who was attempting to enter the European market. Ironically, Chrysler had purchased Simca the year earlier, who had earlier purchased Automobiles Talbot, originally the British brand that had been merged into STD Motors many years earlier.
Chrysler&#x27;s experience with the Rootes empire appears to have been unhappy. Models were abandoned over the next few years while they tried to build a single brand from the best models of each of the company&#x27;s components. For management, &quot;best&quot; typically meant &quot;cheapest to produce,&quot; which was at odds with the former higher-quality Rootes philosophy. Brand loyalty began to erode, and was greatly damaged when they decided to drop former marques and start calling everything a Chrysler. The Tiger was dropped in 1967 after an abortive attempt to fit it with a Chrysler engine, and the Hillman Imp–derived Stiletto disappeared in 1972.

The last Sunbeam produced was the &quot;Rootes Arrow&quot; series Alpine/Rapier fastback (1967–76), after which Chrysler, who had purchased Rootes, disbanded the marque. The Hillman (by now Chrysler) Hunter, on which they were based, soldiered on until 1978.

A Hillman Avenger-derived hatchback, the Chrysler Sunbeam, maintained the Sunbeam name, as a model rather than a marque, from 1977. Following the takeover of Chrysler Europe by PSA Group, the model was branded as the Talbot Sunbeam from 1979 through to its discontinuation in 1981. The Sunbeam name has not been used on a production car since then.

<doc id="1169493" wikidata="Q1853913" url="?curid=1169493" title="Paul Hart">
<text>Paul Anthony Hart (born 4 May 1953) is an English football manager, coach, and former professional player who made 567 appearances in the Football League as a defender. Hart was most recently assistant manager to Nathan Jones at Charlton Athletic.

The son of Johnny Hart, who played for and managed Manchester City, and brother of Nigel, a defender who made more than 300 League appearances, Hart had five-year spells with both Blackpool and Leeds United, and shorter spells with Stockport County, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday, among others.

He began his management career with Chesterfield in 1988, but left within three years and spent the following decade as a youth team coach for Leeds United and then Nottingham Forest. In 2001, he returned to management with Nottingham Forest, later managing Barnsley, Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Portsmouth, Queens Park Rangers, Crystal Palace and Swindon Town. In 2014, he joined the youth set-up at Notts County as acting academy manager.

==Playing career==
Hart came through the juniors at Stockport County, turned professional in 1970, and made his Football League debut as a 17-year-old, on 9 October in a 4–3 win against Lincoln City in the Fourth Division. He had a run of games at the end of that season, and was a first-team regular for the next two seasons, before signing for Second Division club Blackpool in June 1973 for a fee of &quot;about £25,000&quot;.

He made his Blackpool debut on 22 October 1973, and only made two more appearances that season. Eventually, though, he established himself as a regular first-teamer and, in 1976–77, when he scored six goals as Blackpool challenged for promotion, he was ever-present.

In March 1978, after making 143 league appearances, scoring fifteen goals in the process, Hart left relegation-bound Blackpool for Leeds United for £300,000, as a replacement for Gordon McQueen. Hart spent five years at Elland Road, playing 191 games.

In 1983 Hart signed for Nottingham Forest to replace Willie Young, where he played 87 games and scored three goals. Hart actually scored in the controversial 1983–84 UEFA Cup semi-final against Anderlecht, but the goal was ruled out for no apparent reason and Anderlecht subsequently admitted having bribed the official. A year later Hart was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in May 1985.

Hart had further spells at Birmingham City (breaking his leg in his only game for them) and Notts County (as player-coach) before retiring from playing in 1988, having made 567 league appearances.

==Managerial and coaching career==
===Chesterfield===
After the spell at Notts County, Hart was appointed manager of Chesterfield in 1988. Joining the club when they were firmly rooted to the bottom of the Third Division, he reorganised and revitalised the playing side of the club with assistant Chris McMenemy. Thanks especially to a number of notable number of home wins in the first three months of 1989 and a surprising 3–1 win at second place Sheffield United in early January, the team climbed out of the bottom four. However, this proved to be only a temporary abatement of the club&#x27;s problems at that time. Despite bringing great performances from striker Dave Waller, who equalled the club&#x27;s record for goals in consecutive games – eight – Chesterfield were relegated in the penultimate game. The following season saw Chesterfield reach the play-off final at Wembley after spending almost the entire season in the top seven, underlying Hart&#x27;s ability and promise as a young manager. The team was defeated 0–1 by Cambridge United for whom Dion Dublin scored the winning goal. In February 1990, he gave 19-year-old Sean Dyche his Football League debut. Given no funds for squad improvement for the 1990–91 season, results and form were extremely indifferent. He was sacked on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1991.

===Leeds United===
Hart then moved into youth coaching firstly at Nottingham Forest, and then subsequently took charge of Leeds United&#x27;s fledgling academy. Hart&#x27;s proteges won the FA Youth Cup in 1993 and 1997 and formed the backbone of the Leeds side that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2000–01. With International players such as Harry Kewell, Jonathan Woodgate, Ian Harte, Alan Smith, Gary Kelly, Paul Robinson, Matt Jones and Stephen McPhail.

===Nottingham Forest===
Hart then returned to take charge of Nottingham Forest&#x27;s academy after a high-profile fall-out with Leeds manager George Graham over the promise of Jonathan Woodgate. Forest&#x27;s Under-19 side became immensely successful winning the Under-19 title in 1999–2000. As the first team were faltering, and the club spiralling further into debt, players such as David Prutton, Jermaine Jenas, Keith Foy, Chris Doig, David Freeman, Kevin Dawson, Gareth Williams, Richard Cooper and Gareth Edds were blooded, with a further line of players including Barry Roche, Andy Reid, Brian Cash, Eugen Bopp, John Thompson and Michael Dawson following subsequently.

On 12 July 2001, Hart was promoted from Youth Academy Director to manager, succeeding David Platt, who had recently left the club to become the manager of the England under-21 team. After less than a month of his tenure, Hart made his entire squad available for transfer, after being informed he had to drastically reduce the wage bill to avoid the club going into financial ruin. As a result, Hart lost several experienced and key players, notably Andy Johnson to West Bromwich Albion for £200,000, Alan Rogers to Leicester City for an undisclosed fee, and Stern John to Birmingham City for £100,000.

During the 2002–03 season, with the financial problems alleviated somewhat, and having the benefit of a settled side, Hart guided the club to the First Division play-offs, losing 4–3 after extra-time and 5–4 on aggregate to Sheffield United in the semi-finals.

Forest started the 2003–04 season well, but a run of 14 games without a win resulted in Hart being sacked after a 1–0 home defeat to Coventry City on 7 February 2004.

===Barnsley===
Less than a month after being forced out of the City Ground, Hart accepted the offer of the manager&#x27;s job at Second Division club Barnsley. However, he left the club a year later after failing to mount a serious promotion challenge.

===Rushden &amp; Diamonds===
In May 2006, Hart took over as manager of Rushden &amp; Diamonds, following the departure of Barry Hunter. After an average start to the season, Diamonds embarked on an eight match winless run, leading to Hart leaving the club in October by mutual consent.

===Portsmouth===
Hart joined Premier League club Portsmouth as Director of Youth Operations in 2007. He was asked to take over as caretaker manager, initially for one game only following the sacking of Tony Adams on 9 February 2009. Shortly afterwards, Hart brought Brian Kidd in as his assistant. He won his first game in charge 2–0 at home to Manchester City on 14 February 2009. Hart continued as caretaker manager until the end of the 2008–09 season, Portsmouth executive chairman Peter Storrie announcing in March 2009, after a close 1–0 defeat to Chelsea, &quot;(Alexandre Gaydamak) and I have been delighted with how the team have fared. They both have so much experience in the game and they have the respect of the players. We will review the managerial situation again at the end of the season.&quot;

Hart was appointed as permanent manager on a two-year contract on 21 July 2009. In the 2009–10 season, however, Portsmouth, a club in turmoil and on the brink of administration, had the worst ever start by a Premier League team, losing their first seven league games. This run was finally ended when Portsmouth recorded a 1–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 3 October 2009. On 24 November 2009, with only two Premier League wins in 13 games and three points adrift at the bottom of the table, Hart was sacked. He declined the offer of an alternative role as technical director responsible for players aged 18–21, and left the club.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 17 December 2009, Hart was appointed manager of Queens Park Rangers following the exit of Jim Magilton the previous day, with Mick Harford joining him as assistant manager. On 15 January 2010, after only five games in charge, Hart left the club, with his assistant Mick Harford taking temporary charge.

===Crystal Palace===
On 2 March 2010, Hart was appointed caretaker manager of Crystal Palace with Dougie Freedman as assistant manager and John Pemberton as first-team coach. This followed the departure of Neil Warnock a day earlier, who left the club to become the manager of Queens Park Rangers, bringing Mick Jones and Keith Curle with him. Crystal Palace were in administration, and Hart&#x27;s task was to keep them in the Championship. This was achieved on Hart&#x27;s final day in the job after a 2–2 draw with Sheffield Wednesday, which saw the hosts relegated instead. Hart left Crystal Palace at the end of the season.

In June 2010, it was announced that Hart was on the shortlist to become the successor to Phil Brown at the recently relegated Hull City. The job however was given to former Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson.

===Swindon Town===
Hart was appointed manager of Swindon Town on 3 March 2011, with his new club in the League One relegation zone. He appointed former Notts County manager Ian McParland as his assistant. On 28 April 2011, Hart was sacked after failing to lead Swindon out of the relegation zone, with the club managing only one win in 11 games under his tenure, a 1–0 away win over Brentford on 9 April 2011.

===Charlton Athletic===
On 3 June 2011, Hart joined Charlton Athletic as Academy Director. He left the club on 21 May 2014 following a restructure in the Charlton Academy.

===Notts County===
On 2 October 2014, Hart was appointed as acting academy manager at League One club Notts County, following the suspension of academy manager Mick Leonard. He later became caretaker manager, a day after the sacking of manager Shaun Derry on 23 March 2015, following a run of three wins in 24 league games. Hart guided the club to three draws in three games, before the appointment of Ricardo Moniz as manager on 7 April 2015. He subsequently left Notts County, stating it was always his attention to leave after the departure of Shaun Derry.

===Return to Leeds United===
On 29 August 2015, it was announced that Hart would return to Leeds United as the Academy Director and Under-21s Manager. He left the club on 1 April 2016 due to personal matters.

===Luton Town===
On 3 May 2016, Hart was appointed as the assistant manager of League Two club Luton Town.

===Stoke City===
In January 2019 Hart was appointed assistant manager to Nathan Jones at Stoke City. Hart and Jones left Stoke on 1 November 2019.

===Luton Town===
On 19 June 2020, Hart returned to Luton Town for the remainder of the season. It was confirmed he would continue as part of the back room staff for the 2020/21 season.

===Return to Charlton Athletic===
On 9 February 2024, Hart returned to Charlton Athletic to serve as assistant manager to Nathan Jones once more. Jones had joined Charlton as first team manager five days prior on 4 February 2024.

On 29 August 2024, Hart stepped down from his role as assistant manager at Charlton Athletic.
